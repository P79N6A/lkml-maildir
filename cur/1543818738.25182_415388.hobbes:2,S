Subject: latency problems with kernel >= 2.6.15 and glibc 2.3.6

Hello folks,
I am experiencing latency problems with kernels above 2.6.15 and my self-compiled system.
I am using glibc 2.3.6 (pthreads + libidn) compiled against kernel 2.6.12 headers.
If a process needs 100% CPU power the latency is becoming terrible. If i 
nice that process to a lower priority effects are not that strong. 
Especially working with a web browser displaying a website where multiple 
flashplayer-plugins were startet the system is almost unusable. Input 
events are not catched, mouse and sounds stuck and so on...
Preemption model is "low-latency-desktop", 
CONFIG_PREEMPT_BKL: 1
CONFIG_HZ: 1000
Has anyone experienced similar problems?
Sven
