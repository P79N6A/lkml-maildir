Agreed.  But I think it is a healthier starting point then the fbdev
location.  A little refactoring and we should be able to handle
the generic case.

Yes.  Although my earlier patch fixed that :)
It is also worth nothing that the pci prefetchable attribute 
says that write-combining is safe through that bar.

It is possible.  It is just a matter of looking for other mappings of the
same thing, and seeing if one exists seeing if it has the mapping
attributes you are asking for.  We have reverse mappings and
the basic infrastructure.
The justification for pursuing reverse mappings really is that it is
less work than taking weeks tracing down the one bug caused by
allowing this and then silently corrupting data.
The obvious problem comes when one mapping is write combined and
the other mapping is write back.
