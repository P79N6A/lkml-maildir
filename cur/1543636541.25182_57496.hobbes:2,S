I was using a little script to warm up my file cache for Specweb runs 
when Martin Bligh said that it might be a good test of your kmap 
patches.  I ran 8 greps in parallel (1-per-cpu) through a 10-gigabyte 
Specweb file set which is on a RAID array.  The RAID is how I can do a 
cold run in 3 minutes 30 sec :).  Each grep works on a disjoint set of 
data.
Here's a run with the cache already warm:

You'll probably only care about greptime.total, and lockstat.  The 
network stuff is cruft from when I actually run Specweb.
Here's a cold cache run:

+lm+kmapfun-07-18-2002-18.25.55/
Here are warm and cold, without the kmap patches

I would give you oprofile data, but it appears that NMIs wreak havoc 
on a certain vendor's hardware.  When oprofile is compiled in, my box 
gets quite unstable.
