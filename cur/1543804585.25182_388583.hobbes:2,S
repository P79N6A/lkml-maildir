The responsibility for ensuring that those bugfixes get back to "some
central place" is with the folk who created the bugfixes.
I've seen this _far_ too many times - it's what I call "the CVS disease"
and it happens _a_ _lot_ in certain areas.
Developer X uses a CVS tree for his work and has write access to that
tree.  He finds a bug, and fixes it.  Maybe he writes a good explaination
of the bug and puts it in the CVS commit comments.  He commits the fix.
When he's done with development, he walks away and the fix never gets
submitted.  (Not everyone operates this way, but I know some do.)
As a mainline guy myself, I'll say we're all welcome to whatever bug
fixes come our way.  We just need someone to send them to us with an
adequate explaination of the bug.

Do you know about the bugfix-only kernel series, which have 4-digit
versions - 2.6.x.y - which is the compromise to satisfy folk with the
issue you're bringing up in this paragraph?
