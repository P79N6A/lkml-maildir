Still not out of the woods here :-(.  Built 2.6.17-rc2 with gcc-4.0
and binutils 2.16.91 (package name is binutils_2.16.1cvs20060117-1)
and I'm still getting the kobject_add error.
Mathieu -- you mentioned testing with a cross-compile.  Was that the
case for your reported success?  How about a native compile?  I'm
pretty sure this *is* a binutils issue, but we don't quite have it
nailed down yet.
