Can you do this against -mm please ?
There's been some changes, which mean that your patch won't apply
without fuzz, which git-apply hates.
(19:06:04:davej@hera:cpufreq)$ git-applymbox -k ~/cf
1 patch(es) to process.
Applying '[CPUFREQ] the overdue removal of X86_SPEEDSTEP_CENTRINO_ACPI'
error: patch failed: arch/x86_64/kernel/cpufreq/Kconfig:65
error: arch/x86_64/kernel/cpufreq/Kconfig: patch does not apply
Thanks,
	Dave
