You could try to get scheduling latency down into the 1-2ms range
without resorting to kernel preemption.  rt_secret_rebuild is the main
problem - it does not take any spinlocks, and is not a hot path, but
runs in softirq context and is thus non-preemptible.  Even if you
don't succeed you'll acquire a deep knowledge of the networking code.
