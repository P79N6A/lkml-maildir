 Ok, now it works with the test case fixed:
"""
testing mask alloc upto 24 bits
verify & free
mask fffff
mask 1fffff
mask 3fffff
mask 7fffff
mask ffffff
done
"""
 Do you remember the BUG_ON() I was getting because of the
sound card driver [1] ?
 It seems to me that the problem is that it's setting
__GFP_COMP. The following patch fixes it for me:
"""

 Also, I think you forgot to protect the __free_pages_mask()
call with "#ifdef CONFIG_MASK_ALLOC" in patch mask-compat.
 Question: let's say that the devices I have consumes only
5MB of the whole reserved pool (16MB), of course that it's
ok to reduce the pool to 5MB, right?
 I have more machines to test this stuff...
