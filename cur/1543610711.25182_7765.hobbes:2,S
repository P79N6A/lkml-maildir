I would have to study the problem in more depth to give a good answer,
I am primarily concerned with not having to maintain a 'personal'
kernel patch to get DHCP relaying to work for G4's.  I doubt
writing Apple would get any responses :(

 I agree this MUST is overkill.  but then also

I believe this is common behaviour for non-promiscuous interfaces .. ?
I agree it would be nicer if it didn't drop it but it does, and
DHCP relaying is a perfectly valid thing to do, so the current
code breaks this (for the G4 OF, possibly for other platforms as well).

 Indeed that experimental document does not address arp cache corruption
 at all.  Presumably hosts would have to ignore packets
 that have SIP and TIP the same unless it is what they are using...

Who can we ask for an answer as to why this might be done ?
Hmm. 
http://www.freesoft.org/CIE/RFC/826/6.htm
Shows a pseudo-code that indicates a check should
be performed to see if THA is "ours" and if not, discard the packet
-- BEGIN snippet --
When an address resolution packet is received, the receiving Ethernet module gives the packet to the Address Resolution module which goes through an
algorithm similar to the following. Negative conditionals indicate an end of processing and a discarding of the packet. 
?Do I have the hardware type in ar$hrd?
Yes: (almost definitely)
  [optionally check the hardware length ar$hln]
  ?Do I speak the protocol in ar$pro?
  Yes:
    [optionally check the protocol length ar$pln]
    Merge_flag := false
    If the pair  is
        already in my translation table, update the sender
        hardware address field of the entry with the new
        information in the packet and set Merge_flag to true. 
    ?Am I the target protocol address?
    Yes:
-- END snippet --
Maybe the right fix then is to set DHA to all ones. ffffffffffff. ?
