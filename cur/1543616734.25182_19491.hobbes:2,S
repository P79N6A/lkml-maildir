Ka-ching! Being able to use a fwded net connection without masq was the 
needed clue. I looked at the patches and found this one:

As it appeared to deal directly with compatability redirection I removed
this one first and recompiled the kernel. Before, a minute or so of
browsing via a redirected connection (to squid) would make the box go
boom. I've just browsed for 15 minutes to different sites and the box
has not gone down.
Now, if you need the oops then holler and I'll see what I can do about
getting it to you. Writing it down would be a pain so I may opt for the
null-modem cable which may take a week or so for me to get at though.
