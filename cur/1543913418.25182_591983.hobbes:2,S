Hi list,
issuing `echo "- - -" >/sys/class/scsi_host/host0/scan` where host0 is a 
0001:00:03.0 SCSI storage controller: LSI Logic / Symbios Logic 53c875 
(rev 14)
sym0: <875> rev 0x14 at pci 0001:00:03.0 irq 13
does not produce any dmesg messages (2.6.21), so I suspect it did not 
rescan the bus; though, the echo command _did_ take a while (as does the 
boot procedure), so it may have done _something_ and does not let me 
know. How could I verify this, or does sym53c8xx.ko does not support 
rescanning?
	Jan
