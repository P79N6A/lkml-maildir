it makes for a "clean" and robust rootkit rather than a fragile one

that's why there is a config option :) THe 2Mb advantage is a bit
overrated btw; there are very few such tlbs in current processors so the
kernel gets tlb misses anyway. And since most of the code is in the
first 2Mb (which isn't broken up) of the kernel text it's not that bad
tlb wise either
(and it was Andi that pointed that out, not me)
