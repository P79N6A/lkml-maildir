Well, as I said -- I'm trying to revisit all of these, especially the
currently broken handling of G0, G1, G2, G3 and the other ISO 2022
issues.
ISO 2022:1994 is also known as ECMA-35, and is available at:
	
http://www.ecma.ch/stand/ECMA-035.HTM
Just as a proof that the current Linux console is broken, the ISO 2022
(actually, ISO 2375) code for Latin-1 (ISO 8859-1) is:
	<ESC> ( B <ESC> - A
... and the one for Latin-9 (ISO 8859-15) is:
	<ESC> ( B <ESC> - b
Linux cannot properly distinguish between these, since it considers
8-bit character sets to be atomic, rather than composed of two 7-bit
character sets, which is the ISO 2022 model.
The ISO 2375 registry has a home page at:
