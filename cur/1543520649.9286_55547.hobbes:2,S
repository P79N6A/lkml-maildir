from init/main.c:
        if (open("/dev/console", O_RDWR, 0) < 0)
                printk("Warning: unable to open an initial console.\n");
        (void) dup(0);

Kernel can't open /dev/console. Probably you tried to mount a file system
for root which is not (for example your ext2 partition holding the /usr
file system), and it does not contain the "/dev/console" device.
