What about a simple example where you set write a bit plane mask into a graphics
register, then write some data to the framebuffer? You can't have two programs doing
that at the same time!
This could easily occur if an X client were directly manipulating the framebuffer at the
same time the X server was doing the same, or if you switch away from X (with the server
still running...) and try to play a graphics game on the framebuffer console while your
kernel compiles!
