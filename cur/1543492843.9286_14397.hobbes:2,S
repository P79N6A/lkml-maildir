Hi Ingo,
I wanted to give you a bug report about yout PIII patch, using the new
FXSAVE/FXRESTOR instructions of the PIII (and PII-Deschutes), which are
supposed to be a little bit faster.
Your patch for 2.2.2 from Mar 2 causes problems for both 2.2.2-ac7 and
2.2.5-ac3(+devfs) on my Dual PII (deschutes) box. 
Symptoms: 
* My multithreaded numerical benchmark fails (seemingly random NANs)
* KDE crashes X crashes the console on logging out
So I guess, the patched kernel does not correctly save and retore the FP
registers. Debugging suggests, that this is what actually happens.
I reversed the patch on my 2.2.5-ac3 kernel and the problems have
disappeared, now.
Just wanted to let you know. In case there is a more recent version of the
patch to try, please let me know.
