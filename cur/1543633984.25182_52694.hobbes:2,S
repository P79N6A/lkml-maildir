I don't follow you here. IMHO it is much easier to fix the MTRRs in the
MTRR driver for those rare buggy BIOS (if they exist - I've never seen one)
than to hack up all of memory management just to get the right bits set.
I see no disadvantage of using the MTRRs and it is lot simpler than
PAT and pte bits.
