This sounds like a kludge to fix an IBM-PC brain damage. Rather
than reserve "special" memory, why not provide a way to reclaim
a given page of (physical) memory. A module can then force some
other process to vacate memory below 16MB, and claim it for its
own purposes. Some sort of flag would be required to indicate a
valid need for certain (physical) pages, so that a module can't
force out say another module also using DMA-able memory.
Would the easiest way to do this be to force the physical pages
into swap, then mark them your own? It wouldn't be fast, but it
doesn't need to be and I think this change would require fewest
modifications to the existing code. How could this be done on a
machine with no swap?
