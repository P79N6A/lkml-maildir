i missed that (way too many mails in this thread).
Here is how i counted them:
 $ grep "\<trace_.*(" * | wc -l
 359
some of those are not true tracepoints, but there's at least this many 
of them:
 $ grep "\<trace_.*(" *instrumentation* | wc -l
 235
so the real number is somewhere between.
 patch-2.6.17-lttng-0.5.108-instrumentation-arm.diff
 patch-2.6.17-lttng-0.5.108-instrumentation.diff
 patch-2.6.17-lttng-0.5.108-instrumentation-i386.diff
 patch-2.6.17-lttng-0.5.108-instrumentation-mips.diff
 patch-2.6.17-lttng-0.5.108-instrumentation-powerpc.diff
 patch-2.6.17-lttng-0.5.108-instrumentation-ppc.diff
 patch-2.6.17-lttng-0.5.108-instrumentation-s390.diff
 patch-2.6.17-lttng-0.5.108-instrumentation-sh.diff
 patch-2.6.17-lttng-0.5.108-instrumentation-x86_64.diff
when judging kernel maintainance overhead, the sum of all patches 
matters. And i considered all the other patches too (the ones that add 
actual tracepoints) that will come after the currently offered ones, not 
just the ones you submitted to lkml.
