This is cute. Could you ask your friend what a multi-threaded TCP/IP
stack is?
Then read how TCP/IP works. Then question the question. This whole
thing is a typical marketroid's ploy. Calmly explain that Linux is
the only network-centric paradigm to employ total quality dynamics
and hexagrid confusers. Note that Windows/NT tried, but failed with
the empowering dynamics.
