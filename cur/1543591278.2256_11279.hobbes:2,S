Well yes and no.  The numbers are currently repeatable for a given kernel, but
I know I and others were bitten by the 2.2. to 2.4 transition, where the kernel
used a different algorithm for the order in which it detected scsi and network
adapters (ie, in my machine with 3 scsi adapters, Linux 2.2 always picked the
Adaptec scsi adapter builtin into my motherboard as the first adapter, but 2.4
decided to pick my TekRam 390F adapter).
As lots of people have been saying, you need to know which physical slot to
plut the wire connecting eth0, eth1, etc. into.  Similarly for serial ports, if
I have 3 or 4 (or 127 :-) USB serial devices, I really don't want to have to
change my cabling each time I boot or change OSes (since I doubt my UPS will be
happy if I give it the commands destined for the X10 controller or my remote
boards).
