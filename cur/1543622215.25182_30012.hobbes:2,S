Question: if (from below) you are going to use atomic operations, why
make it per-CPU at all?  Just have one counter and atomic_inc and
atomic_read it.  You won't need a spin lock.

This would be atomic and thus preempt-safe on any sane arch I know, as
long as we are dealing with a normal type int.  Admittedly, however, we
can't be sure what the compiler would do.
Thinking about it, you are probably going to be doing this:
	++counter[smp_processor_id()];
and that is not preempt-safe since the whole operation certainly is not
atomic.  The current CPU could change between calculating it and
referencing the array.  But, that wouldn't matter as long as you only
cared about the sum of the counters.

Agreed, although I bet its not noticeable.

I can think up a few more uses of the irq/memory-safe atomic ops, so I
bet this isn't that bad of an idea.  But no point doing it without a
corresponding use.
