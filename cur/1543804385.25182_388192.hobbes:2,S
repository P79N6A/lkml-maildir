That won't help - there are exactly zero pages on ZONE_DMA's LRU.
The problem appears to be that all of the DMA zone has been gobbled up by
the BIO layer.  It seems quite inappropriate that a modern 64-bit machine
is allocating tons of disk I/O pages from the teeny ZONE_DMA.  I'm
suspecting that someone has gone and set a queue's ->bounce_gfp to the wrong
thing.
Jens, would you have time to investigate please?
