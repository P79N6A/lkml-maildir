I am currently using Linux kernel 2.4.25 with software raid 5 and ext3.
I've noticed recently some people noting corruption with raid 5 and ext3
in the 2.6 kernel tree on the Linux kernel mailing list. I'd like to
know if upgrading to the 2.6 tree would be safe for me at this time
(have these problems been fixed?) or if that's questionable, who I
should ask for more information on the situation.
Sorry for bothering you,
Timothy C. McGrath
