fs/nfsd/nfs4xdr.c:2659:32: warning: incorrect type in argument 2 (different base types)
fs/nfsd/nfs4xdr.c:2659:32:    expected int [signed] nfserr
fs/nfsd/nfs4xdr.c:2659:32:    got restricted unsigned int [usertype] status
is what got triggered.  I.e. call in
        case OP_SECINFO:
                nfsd4_encode_secinfo(resp, op->status, &op->u.secinfo);
                break;
which pointed to the misannotated function...
