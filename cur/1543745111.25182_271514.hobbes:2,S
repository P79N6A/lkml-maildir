Hello, 
Does anybody know how to access the address of the
current executing instruction in C while the program
is executing? 
Also, is there a method to load a program image from
memory not a file (an exec that works with a memory
address)? Mainly I am looking for a method that brings
a program image into memory modify parts of it and
start the in-memory modified version. 
Can anybody think of a method to replace a thread
image without replacing the whole process image? 
Thanks, 
Ali
