... *and* which hasn't got fast recovery from connection loss.
For example, NNTP uses long-lived TCP connections, but it is NOT
vulnerable because restart is very cheap.
Given the other benefits of fast recovery, it's better to concentrate
on that than to tack something on the TCP stack which only solves a
tiny subset of the problems (which isn't even relevant in practice).
