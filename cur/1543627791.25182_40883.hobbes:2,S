Hi,
Hitachi Ltd. Japan has developed a Mainframe OS compatible
file system on Linux, and will make the source code available in GPL.
The file system is named "mainframe file system" or mffs for short
and can access disks formatted by Hitachi's VOS3 operating system
and its compatibles : )
Reading and writing a plain sequential file
(DSORG=PS RECFM=F,FB,V,VB in mainframe jargon) is possible.
Partitioned dataset members
(Do not care if it dose not make sense to you.)
can be read.
Ebcdic to ascii character code translation can be performed.
So, for example, you can cat SYS1.PARMLIB/IAASYS00.
File metadata update is still under development, so you cannot create
nor extend a file.
Mainframe file system is designed in hope to replace lengthy
file transfer batch jobs. Existing mainframe volumes can be
mounted and accessed directly from Linux running on mainframes.
Let me say again. NO FILE TRANSFERS from/to mainframes.
Hitachi has modified the disk driver code under drivers/s390/block
so that mffs can issue arbitrary disk commands such as READ TRACK.
All the source code will be available in GPL in May 2002
under
