This isn't the case on ARM.  I've always told people 'make zImage'
or 'make Image'.  I've never told people to use just 'make' on its
own - in fact, I've never used 'make' on its own with the kernel.

You can't fit details for 500 platforms into half a line of text.

uboot support on ARM was only recently added, and only happened
because I happened to misread the patch.  Had I been more on the
ball, the support would NOT have been merged.  However, as it did
get merged, I didn't want to create extra noise by taking it out.
Please don't take this as acceptance that throwing the uboot crap
into the kernel for ARM was something I found agreeable.  I still
find it distasteful that boot loaders have to define their own
image formats and the kernel has to conform to the boot loader
authors whims.
