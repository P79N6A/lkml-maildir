Yes---physical addressing for I/O is reality.  Some devices may
not implement scatter-gather, and some may do so and yet still be
afflicted with high latencies for descriptor fetching and
the like.
If allocations are rare, it doesn't seem that unreasonable to actually
do physical copies, push stuff bodily out of the way to construct a new
contiguous region.  Or else a separate allocator, like the present-day
bigphysarea.
