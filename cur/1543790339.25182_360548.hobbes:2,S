If you were running a vanilla kernel you'd get full support from the mailing 
list. If you were running plain ck8 I could offer you limited support. But 
adding your own patches makes it impossible for us to know what your code 
looks like and that you haven't merged incompatible code wrongly. Only the 
person who merged the code would be able to provide you with support.
My advice to you is try a mainline kernel release that has the features you 
need and see if the bug exists. Then you'll get more response from the 
mailing list.
Cheers,
Con
