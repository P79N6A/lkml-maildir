Currently, it's sometimes non-trivial to figure out what is part of the 
ABI and what is not.
E.g. if you want to change a struct, how do you know whether it's part 
of the userspace ABI?

Agreed.
But let's discuss the naming after this discussion.

Sure.

I do still not get your point.
The ABI headers will be used by C libraries.
And by some programs doing low-level Linux specific things - but these 
are exceptions.
Normal userspace programs will simply not care about the contents of the 
kernel ABI headers - the libc will present them pretty headers adhering 
to all past, current and future standards.
This works today and it will continue to work.
