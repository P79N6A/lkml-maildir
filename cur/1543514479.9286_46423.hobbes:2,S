Hiya,
I was wondering if all the mindcraft redux fixes have gone into 
2.2.13? If not what parts are missing? 
I have read about the whole mess at:
http://www.kegel.com/mindcraft_redux.html
But it doesnt give any detail on what kernel revs the fixes actually
made it into.  I am building a pretty high power production web server and
I would like all the tweaks i can get:) 
Thanks
Mike
