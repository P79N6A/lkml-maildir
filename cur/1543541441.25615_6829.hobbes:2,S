Of course. In fact, I seriously recommend NOT overclocking because of the
eventual wear on hardware that can occur, even if there Seems to be no
problems at first. But this has nothing to do with the kernel at all--
overclocking from my point of view was only a 3-minute experiment to see how
well the system would react to it, and believe me, it wasn't pretty. :)
Now if the board permitted me to increase the clock multiplier on just the
CPU, then I could find out exactly what the limits are of one piece of
hardware. But I don't, and any problems I find with the system at that point I
would attribute to overclocking (or degrade of hardware thereafter). As to
clarify someone else's email, none of my kernel bug reports or patches have
come from a system that has been overclocked. To me, that's just ludicrous.
One thing I had thought about after reading your email, however, was the ISA
bus speed. I would hopefully assume it's still running at 33 or 66 MHz in my
system, and not 100, because I'm sure my old ISA AWE32 card wouldn't care for
100. I don't think 100 MHz FSB was around at the time..or I could be wrong.
Interesting concept, though. :)
