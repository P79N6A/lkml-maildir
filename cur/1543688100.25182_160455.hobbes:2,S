In 2.6, the file /etc/modprobe.conf is used. When you use Red Hat, you 
can install their modutils package from RawHide, that creates that file 
from your /etc/modules.conf file.
There is probably some util around that creates the file for you. This 
issue is documented in the FAQ in the modutils source.

This means that you already got the proper modutils version installed.
