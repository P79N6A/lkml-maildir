I may be doing something the wrong way. I absolutely don't intend to
start flames in this list.
Alex, your driver is great. You have done enormous amount of work,
reverse engineering proprietary drivers. Since the territory you work on
is unchartered, you can choose any design model, you see appropriate.
However, since we are working in an open community, everyone can give
his opinion on this issue. The commenter must definitely back his words
with real arguments. The patch at the top of this thread is such an
argument. You may or may not care about it, at will.
I have submitted my version only after I have failed to find a stable
version of your driver for the current kernel. If there is one, just
post link to the patch. If not, let's make one.
