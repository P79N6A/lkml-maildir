I think VIRT is a total virtual space taken by process, part of
which may be swapped. VIRT can't be reduced by swapping out -
correct me if I'm wrong.
But I believe even if I'm wrong on that, I simply do not have
90 mbytes to be swapped out here!
Look again at top output - most processes are below 1mb,
many are below 50k thanks to dietlibc.

It's a rather nifty utility from daemontools package.
It my case, it is built with dietlibs. Yes, it is
really takes only 20k of virtual memory when running!
# ldd supervise
        not a dynamic executable
# ls -l supervise
-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root  9668 Oct 19 06:48 supervise

If you don't like it's license, then look here
for alternative implementation:

I think I will lose "it's impossible" argument,
because all processes will be more than 1 mbyte in VIRT.
I will try nevertheless.
