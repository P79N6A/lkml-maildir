hmm:  do_try_to_free_pages() doesn't call kmem_cache_reap() unless
there's no free page shortage.  If you've got a leak...
	if (free_shortage()) {
		shrink_dcache_memory(DEF_PRIORITY, gfp_mask);
		shrink_icache_memory(DEF_PRIORITY, gfp_mask);
	} else {
		/*
		 * Illogical, but true. At least for now.

		 * If we're _not_ under shortage any more, we
		 * reap the caches. Why? Because a noticeable
		 * part of the caches are the buffer-heads,
		 * which we'll want to keep if under shortage.
		 */
		kmem_cache_reap(gfp_mask);
	}
You might try calling it if free_shortage() + inactive shortage() >
freepages.high or some such and then see what sticks out.  Or, for
troubleshooting the leak, just always call it.
Printk says we fail to totally cure the shortage most of the time
once you start swapping.. likely the same for any sustained IO.

(if you hoard IO until you can't avoid it, there're no cleanable pages
left in the laundry chute [bye-bye cache] except IO pages.. i digress;)
