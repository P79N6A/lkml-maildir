Not really, especially since if Linus will go that way I'll simply fork
the tree.

Enough for what? To cover all currently supported devices? Or to allocate
a major for each driver that will ever be written? I can see the value of
the former, but not the latter.

Mostly for the same reasons why I don't like the idea of perpetuating
*FAT and friends.  dev_t as a way to specify device was tolerable on
v7.  It doesn't scale and the fact that you need to expand it indicates
exactly that.  IOW, if we ever need that many device types - numbers
are not going to work.
