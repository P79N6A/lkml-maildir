Makes sense.  I'm curious now what architecture do you have?
Anyway next time I touch this the project will be how to integrate
this into the kernel cleanly.  This round was to figure out how
to get some working code.
If someone beats me to the punch on generalizing this code I won't
mind.
The first pass was a success.  And the performance is reasonable
assuming you don't plug the end you are watching into a usb1 only
port.
Given that I didn't really know anything about usb a week ago I think
I did pretty well :)
