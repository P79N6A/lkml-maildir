If they are correct, then you should only need to know about byte order
in my experience.

Well that is certainly the normal way it is done.  I think a few odd
machines had options for doing different bit orders, but the normal
setup is that it matches since that is the simplest layout when trying
to implement bit shifts in hardware.
