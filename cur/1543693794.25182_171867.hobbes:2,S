Gregor,
I also have an NForce 2 based board on which I have successfully used both
1GB of memory and an AGP video card (Radeon 9000). The unknown memory
controllers do not seem to affect anything. Are you sure you have loaded
the AGP modules (both agpgart and nvidia-agp)? As for all the memory not
being detected, some memory is being reserved for kernel use -- how are
you coming up with the numbers you sent?
Thanks,
Rahul
