Interesting.
The downside is that you now need some script needs to know what to do
with the tasks (unless you have something like DBUS, but that's a ways
off).  There are no correctness concerns AFAICT with userspace not
being on a particular CPU, just performance.
The SIGPWR solution lets a random process deal appropriately without
having to interface with /sbin/hotplug, if it wants to.  And it's a
lot less invasive.
I'll take a look though.
Thanks,
Rusty.
