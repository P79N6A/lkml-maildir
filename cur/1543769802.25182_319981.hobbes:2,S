You mean DCO, not OSDL ("Developer's Certificate of Origin").
And yes, I'll update the SubmittingPatches to state explicitly that the 
sign-off is a public record.

Note that we've never _required_ that the sign-off has an email address 
per se. I much much prefer people to have them, because the sign-off lines 
really have been very useful when we've had issues with some patch 
(several times I've just been able to send a directed email to everybody 
involved), but I don't actually want this to be a requirement. After all, 
10 years goes by, and many people will end up having different email 
addresses anyway.
So I'll just update the documentation that explains the DCO to say 
something like this, and not make it part of the official DCO itself. 
After all, all we really want the sign-off to signify is that you've been 
involved and have the right to pass changes on - the fact that the end 
result is public is really a different issue.
So how about just something like the appended? Along with making a very 
public announcement on linux-kernel for the next kernel release (rather 
than this discussion that is taking place under a fairly obscure subject), 
that should make sure that people are aware of the fact that the thing 
isn't exactly private.
(I think everybody realized that anyway, since a private sign-off would be 
totally pointless, but hey, let's make things as explicit as possible).
