    Hi all :)
    I have a new MP3 player, and when I disconnect it from the USB
port, my logs says:
    <30>Jul 19 18:11:05 kernel: usb.c: USB disconnect on device 00:07.3-1 address 2
    <27>Jul 19 18:11:06 kernel: hub.c: connect-debounce failed, port 1 disabled
    What is that 'connect-debounce' for? Is the port damaged? Am I
doing anything wrong?
    Thanks a lot in advance :)
