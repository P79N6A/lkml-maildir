so it will find new bugs. Since you wrote that patch the ability to try 
numa on 'flat' x86 hardware has found two bugs, one of which (the zone 
alignment thing) could very well affect non-obsolete hardware too.
Andi, triggering bugs as widely as possible is the _whole point_ of QA 
and diversity of testing! Do you disable the compilation of the floppy 
driver just because it's obsolete hardware? Will you remove NUMA 
emulation from x86_64 just because it regularly broke in the past?
Fact is, the more hardware a given feature can be tried on, the better 
tested that feature becomes. I find it quite extreme that this point has 
to even be argued...
