> Howdy,

> I am trying to write a new kernel mode joystick driver for linux. I tested
> my logic by first making a user mode driver and testing it.

> The problem I am facing is in communication with joystick from the kernel
> space.
> 
> 
> I use  request region to gain acces to joystick port from kernel mode, as
> follows:

>         if(request_region(BASEPORT,1,"Joystick")!=NULL)
>         {
>                 printk("\nPort avilable");
>                 printk("\nyou read %d",inb(BASEPORT));
>         }
> 
> Then i use outb and inb functions to access port, and send back the
> joystick reading to the user application.
> 
> 
> The problem is sometimes the joystick read doesnt drop from 255, and thus
> I get no change in input values.
> 
> I examined existing joystick driver code , and Mr.Pavlik  do not use this
> approach. Can you tell mewhere I am wrong?
