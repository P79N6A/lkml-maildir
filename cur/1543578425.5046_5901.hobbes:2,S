I have ext2 (builtin) and autoload [v]fat, msdos, hfs, iso9660 and
occasionally (but not recently) udf as modules for removable media.
vfat is loaded all the time as I have a couple of partitions from
another OS I used to use permantently mounted RO.
As far as I can remember hfs and iso9660 were the only other ones I had used
just before this happened.
As I use the kernel module autoloader I also have a cron entry for rmmod -a
which runs every so often to clear out the unused modules. Although
the logs record rmmod running, they don't say what if any modules were
removed.
