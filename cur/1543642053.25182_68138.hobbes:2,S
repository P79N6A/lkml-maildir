G'day,
gcml2 is (among other things) a Linux kconfig language syntax checker.
Version 0.7.1 is available at:
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=18813&release_id=108721
and
http://www.alphalink.com.au/~gnb/gcml2/download.html
This is a bugfix release of gcml2.  Thanks to Randy Dunlap in particular
for reporting problems.  Future announcements of minor releases will be
on the kbuild-devel list only.
Here is a brief change log.
* Fixed memory corruption error where the banner node was being
  freed but not removed from the hashtable of all nodes.
* The CONFIG_DECSTATION bug in the mips port triggered an assert
  failure in the overlap code; this case is now handled more
  gracefully.
* Added two new warnings, condition-loop and dependency-loop.
* Gracefully handle case where a define_bool is conditional on itself.
* Fixed misfeature where failure to find a "source"d file would
  terminate parsing the remainder of the rulebase.
* Using a symbol name instead of a sub-prompt as the default
  value for a "choice" no longer causes a parse error.
* Various minor bugs, memory leaks, speed improvements.
Greg.
