It's only for mmap data and has nothing to do with control/status
mmap.

mmap is called always after ioctl as long as you use alsa-lib.

The PCM bit is only for mmap data.  The status/control mmap is
irrelevant, and can be used even the PCM data is non-mmappable.

Would be nice, but how to detect it?

Well, the simplest solution is to fix that 64bit incompatiblity in the
struct definition.  Right now, it's still unchanged just to keep the
compatibility with older versions, but it's possible to introduce a
new struct together with new mmap offset, for example.
