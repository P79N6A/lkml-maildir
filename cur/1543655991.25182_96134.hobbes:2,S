The problem is this from the 2.5.50 Changelog that Linus posted:
Dave Jones <davej@suse.de>:
...
  o make cardbus PCI enable earlier
I'm willing to submit a patch, but I think Dave has to make the call whether
it should be backed out entirely, or moved after pci_assign_resource().
I certainly don't understand the code *or* PCI well enough to decide between
those two option...
