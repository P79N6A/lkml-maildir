I have to say I'm very happy with the changes in the last draft.
It's almost ready.  The problems that remain are pretty big, but
easy to fix.
Here are some diffs, with comments interspersed.

> There were two problems in the first paragraph.  First, 2.2 is not
> a "major version"; a "major version" means you increment the first
> digit (e.g. 3.0).  Anyway, it's better to use the same word to mean
> same thing, in this case "update".  Otherwise people have to figure
> out that the "major version" and the "update" are not two different
> things being announced.  Also, the second sentence has become
