This problem seems to be aggravated by reusing the tty_struct for that
tty. With the refcount patch it is now easy to disassociate an
existing tty (and the processes attached to it) from the array
tracking tty minors. A new clean tty_struct can be allocated and made
visible. Init will grab this new struct. Now there is no way to get to
the old one and it can be cleaned up and deleted.
Is this strategy worth coding up? It would really simplify the locking issues.
