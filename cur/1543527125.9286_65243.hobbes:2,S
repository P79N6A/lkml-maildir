The alternative to devfs is what we already have, a working (maybe not
perfect, but working) /dev. And if you already have /dev (and use it),
what's the point of wasting memory on devfs which would duplicate things?
The alternative to /proc is digging through kernel memory.  Since /proc
provides something that is practically required (process information), it's
not unrealistic (but not pretty either) to put information there as well.
