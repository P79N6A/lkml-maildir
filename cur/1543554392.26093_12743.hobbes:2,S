[sent to L-K at DaveM's suggestion]
Shouldn't Linux default to not respond to broadcasts pings? Perhaps I've
set them up wrong, but all of my Linux boxes reply to pings sent to the
broadcast address (RH's 2.2.16-3, 2.2.18pre18, and 2.4.0-test11-pre3).  
Just for safety/non-smurfism, shouldn't they default to not reply ( I
[think] they can be tuned to do so) ? Sorry if this is a config issue that
I overlooked...
