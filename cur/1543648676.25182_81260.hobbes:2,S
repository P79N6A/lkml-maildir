But I dislike the notation of module syscalls.  Syscalls are a global
thing and they shall not be registered without proper review from
all kernel developers.  Driver development is untangled from kernel
development, too and it doesn;t need syscalls.

Fucking no!  Don't add syscall interfaces without review.  Adding
a new syscall for a "security modules" is sign that you got
your design wrong.

Blah, blah, blah.  You don't get more security by pluggin in a buggy
module.

It's the broken design.  Look at windows:  it has tons of cheap
features - and exactly because of that it's such a piece of crap.
