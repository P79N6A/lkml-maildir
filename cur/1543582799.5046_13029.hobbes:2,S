I of course see what you mean and I considered but I tend to believe that's a
minor issue and that most machines will be happier without the global unplug
even if without the global limit.
The only reason we added the limit of I/O in flight is to be allowed to have an
huge number of requests so we can do very large reordering and merges in the
elevator with seeking I/O (4k large IO request) _but_ still we don't have to
wait to lock in ram giga of pages before starting the I/O if the I/O was
contigous. We absolutely need such a sanity limit, it would be absolutely
unsane to wait kupdate to submit 10G of ram to a single harddisk before
unplugging on a 30G machine.
It doesn't need to be exactly "if we unplug not exactly after 1/3 of the global
ram is locked then performance sucks or the machine crashes or task gets
killed".  As Jens noticed sync_page_buffers will unplug the queue at some point
if we're low on ram anyways.
The limit just says "unplug after a rasonable limit, after it doesn't matter
anymore to try to delay requests for this harddisk, not matter if there are
still I/O requests available".
However if you have houndred of different queues doing I/O at the same time it
may make a difference, but probably with tons of harddisks you'll also have
tons of ram... In theory we could put a global limit on top of the the
per-queue one. Or we could at least upper bound the total_ram / 3.
Note that 2.4.0 as well doesn't enforce a global limit of packets in flight.
(while in 2.2 the limit is global as it has a shared pool of I/O requests).
