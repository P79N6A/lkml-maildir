In short: If the changes are generally needed, I can live with them
(as long as I know what patches to revert :-)).
Still it would be nice to let people know what to do if they have problems with
these changes.  Many people don't run -rc kernels and even more people
don't run -mm, so they have no idea that there are known regressions  ...
Greets,
