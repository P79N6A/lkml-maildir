Hi again Willy,
Well.  I've done some testing with apache, and I can reproduce the
problem... too darn well in fact.  It's really bad in 2.6.15 here as
well, and while removing the sleep_avg multiplier and the requeue in
schedule() improved things quite a bit, I still have nasty 30s delays
while trying to pipe commands.  These things alone apparently aren't
going to be enough if you want to ssh into a busy server.
