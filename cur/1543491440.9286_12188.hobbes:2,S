Hi, this is a call for a small explanation.
I'm trying to understand the scheduling part of Linux ( SMP part to be
more precise ) and I don't understand very much the meaning of so-called
"bottom-halves". In particular, I don't completely understand the
relationship between the call to run_task_queue(tq_scheduler) and the
use later of the goodness function ( in which supposedly the scheduler
is making the decission to which task to schedule later ).
I don't intend to ask a lot of questions, is there a document somewhere
with an explanation ? If not, could someone provide me a small
explanation ?
Thanks in advance
Hugo
