This is only needed by the 'add spinlocks/etc to zlib_inflate' changes
that aren't in 2.6.14 stock at least, and I don't think will be in
2.6.15-rc1.
The slightly better solution is I need to talk with Matt Mackall about
his zlib changes and how he thinks p*pc* can be done better, but without
duplicating code again.
