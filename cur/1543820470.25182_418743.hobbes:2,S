I said that we need to audit the _code_ for races.
In the distant past, the rpc code was entirely protected by the BKL
against concurrent access to shared objects (queues, structures,
variables etc). Today, most of those shared objects have been given
their own locks, but nobody has yet gone through the code line by line
in order to check that it is safe to remove the BKL.
Cheers,
