I think it's a libpcap bug, actually, and I think I sent Craig Metz'
diff that fixed it to Marcus some months ago.  But he's a busy guy, so
it's possible he didn't see it.
Anyway, if libpcap stops doing stupid things (reading more data than it
needs to, not using the in-kernel packet filters, etc.), the performance
will improve.  I don't know what version of libpcap NFR is working with
these days, but it might be worthwhile for someone to find out and tweak
it to do the right thing.
