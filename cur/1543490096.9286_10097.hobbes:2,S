Not really.  In NFS, if you know the file handle you can access the file.  At
the moment the file handle is made up of <dentry, ino, dirino, dev>.  The
problem with this is that the handle won't change if the inode is reused. 
Adding a generation number would make that <dentry, ino, dirino, dev, gen>. 
Generation number collision only matters so long as the other 4 are the same,
so in effect you're only concerned about one single inode being assigned the
same generation number twice in succession.
NFS isn't very secure, and filehandle guessing attacks are often quite
successful with more simplisitic generation number generators.  I think this
approach is about as good as you need to get - after all, it only takes a
packet sniffer to get any in-use filehandle you want.
The really obvious solution to reuse is to make a new generation number, and if
it matches the previous one, try again...
