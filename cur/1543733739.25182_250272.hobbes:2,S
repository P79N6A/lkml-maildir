devfsd was not a requirement, it was only a tool for people who wanted
their old device names for devfs devices. I was once doing a miniature
environment for  a package installation  system which used  pure devfs
(i.e.   no  old  dev names),  and  it  was  doing super  well  without
devfs. sysinstall  was the only  process running, and I  could install
Linux on any writeable device without using devfsd.
