...and now I have.  From Jeff's docs:
   debian package: user-mode-linux-doc
   file:///usr/share/doc/user-mode-linux-doc/html/debugging-skas.html
   "If you need to interrupt UML, you can't ^C it because the terminal
   is in raw mode, and the ^C will just hit whatever UML is running.
   What you need to do is send the UML kernel thread a SIGINT from
   another shell. It is normally the first process after the gdb"
I take no responsibility for the following command:
   kill -INT $(pgrep linux | head -n1)

Daniel
