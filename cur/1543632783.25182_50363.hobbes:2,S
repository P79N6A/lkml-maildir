Twenty it is, thanks.
BTW, the "use a gigabyte of readahead" idea would cause VM hysteria
if you access a 600 megabyte file, so I've wound that back to
twenty megs.
Also, it has been suggested that the feature become more fully-fleshed,
to support desktops with one disk spun down, etc.  It's not really
rocket science to do that - the `struct backing_dev_info' gives
a specific communication channel between the high-level VFS code and
the request queue.  But that would require significantly more surgery
against the writeback code, so I'm fishing for requirements here.  If
the current (simple) patch is sufficient then, well, it is sufficient.
