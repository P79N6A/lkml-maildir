Didn't think about that :)

I doubt. In any case, since you provided the nice helpers, it would be very
easy to convert from thread to process flags. My main concern is that we
have 24 include/asm-*/thread_info.h files, but only 1 include/linux/sched.h.
It seems more easy to start with PF_ flags at first.

freezer_do_not_count() implies that we must do try_to_freeze() later, I'd
suggest to shift try_to_freeze() into freezer_count(). Actually, I think that
freezer_do_not_count/freezer_count should be "(void)", like try_to_freeze().
IOW,
	freezer_do_not_count()
	... sleep in 'D' state ...
	freezer_count()
means that current doesn't hold any "important" locks, may be considered as
frozen, it can do nothing except enter refrigerator if it gets CPU.
(Please feel free to ignore, this is a matter of taste of course).

Any reason for 2 separate do_each_thread() loops ?
I think this patch is correct, but I still can't convince myself I really
understand freezer :)
Btw,

Irq only does atomic allocations, so the slab won't play with task->flags.
Still I believe the concern was valid in general and I personally think
the new patch is better (and more generic).
