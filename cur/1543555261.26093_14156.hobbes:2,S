I have a cdrom with iso9660+RR filesystem, with a few hundred files in
ten directories.  With all previous kernels (checked up to test11-pre3),
I had no problems with it.  With test11 final, "ls" command shows
zero entries on the mounted CD, and each "ls" attempt causes this
kernel message:
_isofs_bmap: block < 0
If I open a file directly, it opens and is read fine, so it's only
readdir() that is not working.  Tell me if I need to provide more info.
