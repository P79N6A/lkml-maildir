Well, it boots. FWIW. I've not really tested anything interesting with it, 
but any potential breakage is at least not catastrophic and immediate.

.. and I think this part of it is actually unnecessary, because what 
happens is that a shared anon mapping is turned into a shmem mapping when 
it is inserted, and that actually ends up allocating a file for it. So the 
vma->vm_file for anon mappings will not match a NULL file pointer 
_anyway_, so there's no way it would end up merging.
So my patch can be further simplified, I think, to just the following. 
Even more total lines removed.
I still want somebody else to look at and think about it, though.
