Stupid?  No.
Fixing?  Yes.
Whatever you throw at mount, you want it to fail_safe_.  i.e. in the
worst case, do nothing.

Without any help, mount (userspace) tries to determine the partition
type.  It understands the magics of a LOT of filesystems.
It looks for the NTFS magic before the DOS magic (or any of its variants).

Which is passed to the VFS, and the to the driver which performs some
more rigid tests (hopefully :-)
