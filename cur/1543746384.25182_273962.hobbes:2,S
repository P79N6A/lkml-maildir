How about /usr/include/sys/socket.h (for starters). If you can
actually find all the member names by following all the
included-includes, you probably get some kind of prize.
Note that the __SOCKADDR_ALLTYPES macro is absolutely
amazing. It's possible to have the pre-processor hide
everything, making trouble-shooting pure art!
