Yay!!!!  My first embedded developer who doesn't think it is silly to
use a kernel as a bootloader :)  Or at least the first to admit they
embedded developer.
I need to brush it off but I have a 16K user space that implements a
standard DHCP/TFTP network bootloader. 16K == sizeof(initrd)

It is basically a kernel level exec system call.
But I will see if I can come up with better wording for arch/i386/config.in.
A mass renaming would probably be a hindrance at this point, unless I
see a name that really screams that it is the perfect name.

Oh, thanks.  When I updated my patch at some point that line must have
doubled.

Sorry to be clear:
./kexec memtest 
is the case that is expected to work.
My user space code currently understands two images formats.
bzImage 2.0 or greater and static ELF executables.  So you need
the memtest86 static ELF executable.

Thanks for the success report.
