The dnotify/inotify wakeups are a problem, namely because the implementation 
is braindead: it makes the wrong part of the interface fast (setting up 
notify entries) at the expense of making the rest of the kernel slow (adding 
locks to read()/write()).  read() and write() are incredibly hot paths in 
the kernel and should be optimized at the expense of dnotify and inotify, 
which are uncommon operations.
