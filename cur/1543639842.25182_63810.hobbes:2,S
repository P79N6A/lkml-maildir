I'd be inclined to agree with hch on that.  We have an awful lot of
kernel threads nowadays, and keventd would fill the bill.
Andrea's kernels have keventd running SCHED_RR, and that's appropriate
to this application also.   Not sure about AIO though.

That should be OK.  init never knew about the reparented ones anyway.

We need to start using Rusty's percpu stuff sometime.

get_cpu() here?

This is called under read_lock(&tasklist_lock), but modifies the
task list.

schedule() always returns in state TASK_RUNNING?  (Or at least, it
used to.  Tell me if that changed, quick ;))
And a question: is it not possible to make the exitting task just go
and reap itself?  If it's a matter of freeing the stack pages we could
just add the page to a per-cpu deferred freeing list and reap it in
page reclaim.
