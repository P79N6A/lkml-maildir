The bug originally described a problem on reiserfs, which I believe is
fixed.  A second problem was found on jfs, which probably should have
resulted in a new bug being opened.  The jfs patch is not in mainline
yet.  There are 3 jfs bug fixes ready for mainline in:
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/shaggy/jfs-2.6.git
for-linus
Alternately, you could pull just
29a424f28390752a4ca2349633aaacc6be494db5 from that tree.  (Can you do
this without a tag?)  It is the first unmerged patch in the tree.
Thanks,
Shaggy
