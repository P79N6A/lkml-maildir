Hi all.
I'm having ~2 lockups a day. The following happens:
 If I was under X, i only can use the magic-key, but no other keyboard (eg
numlock) or mouse response, the screen freezes, processes stop.
 If i was using textmode:
  numlock still works
  cursor blinks
  processess stop (eg, gpm doesn't work, outputs freeze)
  i can still switch vt's.
  BUT, i can only type into a few vt's, last time into 3,5,6,7,8, but not
into 1,2 or 4!
I cannot give you any traces, as i dont have any.
Also note that magic-key works, and it says that it umounts filesystems if
i press magic-u, but next time at mount i see that reiserfs is replaying
transactions.
Any ideas?
The machine is a P3-750, 512M ram, abit vp6 mb. No overclocking, and it
passes memtest86.
Balazs Pozsar.
