Subject: [PATCH 01/12] hrtimer: round up relative start time
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

When starting a relative timer we have to round it up the next clock
tick to avoid an early expiry. The problem is that we don't know the
real clock resolution, so we have to assume the worst case, but it's
basically the same as the old code did, so it won't be worse than 2.6.15
and with a better clock interface we can improve this.
