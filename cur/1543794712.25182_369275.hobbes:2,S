If you're going to remove the because clause you might as well remove
the whole comment.  What you have left is either redundant or
mystifying (according to the depth of knowledge of the reader).  And
in fact I don't think I could now say why we don't need an atomic
update sequence there, so I would appreciate something that updates
the "because" part.
