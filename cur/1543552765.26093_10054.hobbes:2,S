Gerald, Benson-
USB in 2.4.0-test9 had several broken pieces in it.
Something like 2.4.0-test10-pre6 is much better IMO.
However, the USB printer driver in test10-pre6 still
needs the attached patch (already sent to Linus).
Please try test10-pre6 with this patch and let me know how it is.
Thanks,
~Randy
