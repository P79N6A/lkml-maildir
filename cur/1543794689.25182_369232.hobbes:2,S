max_cores should be 2 here.

Is there a good reason in the BIOS to not make it contiguous?

It's only the last resort fallback anyways. I would prefer to not
make it more complicated. The recommend way is you supplying
a SRAT table, then you're independent of any such fallback heuristics
and just tell the kernel the right mapping.
