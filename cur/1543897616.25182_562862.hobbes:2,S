Egads...  After rereading that...  What a mess.
int foo(void)
{
	static int a[1][0,2];
}
is, AFAICS, allowed.  Reason:
	int a[0,2]
is a VLA due to 6.7.5.2[4] (0,2 is not an ICE).  However, due to the language
in the same section,
	int a[1][0,2]
is *not* a VLA, since (a) 2 is an ICE and (b) its element type "has a known
constant size" (it does - the value of 0,2 is certainly guaranteed to be 2).
I.e., it's VM type, but not a VLA.  I.e. only the first part of 6.7.5.2[2]
applies and we are actually fine.
	So we can have a static single-element array of int [0,2], but
not a plain static int [0,2].  Lovely, that...
