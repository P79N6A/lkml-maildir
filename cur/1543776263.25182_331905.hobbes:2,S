Hmm.  I can't parse this. ;)
Well, I can bring loopback down, but in this case I can't even
ping my local IP addresses anymore, ping reports 'Invalid argument'
error (there's only one route left after deleting lo on my test
machine - 192.168.1.0/24).

I'm not denying it may be some misconfiguration.  The problem
is that I don't see what/where it is.  All the stuff looks pretty
normal.

Again, I don't understand what do you mean.  The message
in $subj says that something *on this box* sent that bogus
ICMP packet, with source address on this same box.  It may
be a reply to bogus packet sent with src=0.0.0.0 somehow,
or maybe not.  Maybe the host is trying to reply to a packet
sent to one of its local IPs -- eg, imagine I send packet
with src=0.0.0.0 to another host to non-listening port
(rp_filter should be activated in that case I think, but
IF that packet comes from the interface where the default
route goes, rp_filter may not trigger) - and kernel is trying
to send an ICMP reply... back to 0.0.0.0...
Even that does not explain everything still.  My 'default route'
interface - the one which goes to my ISP - I doubt it's possible
from the ISP side to send a packet destined to 192.168.4.2 so
that the packet will come to us - unless their routing is hosed.
The problem is, I can't see what is causing this misconfiguration
or whatever.  I wasn't able to capture such a packet so far either --
it never happened while tcpdump was running.
 Note the local IP address mentioned is different, I've
seen 3 so far, all 3 are local on this box and are on 3
different (ethernet) interfaces (but the ICMP always comes
from lo).

The netmask is perfect - it's 127.255.255.255.  The thing you
quoted is *ethernet* address, not IP address - and for loopback,
it's ok to have that as all-zeros.

Here's how ifconfig shows my interface:
lo        Link encap:Local Loopback
          inet addr:127.0.0.1  Mask:255.0.0.0
          UP LOOPBACK RUNNING  MTU:16436  Metric:1
The above output is from `ip addr'.
