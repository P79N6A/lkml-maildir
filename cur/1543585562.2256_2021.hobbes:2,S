Subject: eepro100 question: why SCBCmd byte is 0x80?

I am trying to get netgear card working on a new (read as potentially buggy
hardware) MIPS board.
The eepro100 driver basically works fine.  It is just after a little while
(usually 2 sec to 15 sec) network communication suddenly stops and I start see
error message like "eepro100: wait_for_cmd_done timeout!".
I looked into this, and it appears that the SCBCmd byte in the command word
has value 0x80 instead of the expected 0.  I looked at the Intel manual, and
it says nothing about the value being 0x80.
Does anybody have a clue here?  I suspect some timing is wrong or a buggy PCI
controller.
Please cc your reply to my email address.  Thanks.
