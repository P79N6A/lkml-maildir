That's nice.  But said operation involves serious wanking with metadata
and _that_ would better have exclusion with write(2) and some warranties

You can do lockless get_block() and truncate().  And it will be a hive

a fscking mess of unbelievable proportions - worse than that in full-blown
rename() support.
