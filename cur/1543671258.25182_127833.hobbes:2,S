We could not.  Consider just the 8 32-bit-wide legacy x86 registers, 
excluding the MMX and FPU registers:
(AX, BX, CX, DX, BP, SI, DI, SP).  32 bits x 8 = 2^256 independent 
states to look up in the table, each state having 256 bits of 
information.  2^264 total bits of information needed.  Assume 1 GB dimms 
(2^30 * 8 bits each = 2^33 bits of info), with a volume of 10 cm^3 per 
DIMM (including a tiny amount of space for air circulation.).
Need 34508731733952818937173779311385127262255544860851932776 cubic 
kilometers of space.
Considerably larger than the volume of the earth, although admittedly 
smaller than the total volume of the universe.
