Manually keep both tables under supervision. I'd guess that if you
send it a format, it will update the factory table (and move the user
bad block table there). 
But most will retry writing to the bad sectors. And with a fully-fresh
copy of the data, it will still be readable, and the blocks will be
marked as ready-for-use, because that's better for performance....

I'm not sure how this happened, but the disk errror messages seem to have
been logged by syslog, and the MCEs seem to have been copied from the 
console: They don't have the date attached....?
