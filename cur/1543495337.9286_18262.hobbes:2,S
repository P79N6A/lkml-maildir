Yes.  I'd guess it's just a leftover from the elder days, and the second
condition can be deleted now.  There was previously some code between the
statements, which would explain why it was overlooked when ifA was added a
long time ago (assuming that ifB was there before ifA).  It also shows
that the minix fs is not really maintained any more.
