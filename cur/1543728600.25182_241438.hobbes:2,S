Actually they are a problem on a loaded system, it's just that 
developers seem to run system with enough power to avoid the issues. And 
if you have a system using burn-free all the time you do use more track 
and the occasional device won't read it.
If someone would note the capabilities needed to allow these things 
maybe jrg would have one less thing to complain about.
