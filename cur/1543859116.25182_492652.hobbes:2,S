That implies that we passed it lru_pages=-1.
Presumably the logic in
vmscanc-account-for-memory-already-freed-in-seeking-to.patch caused that.

There is one wart in shrink_all_memory() and I think we should fix that in
2.6.20.
Please check the below.  I'll drop
vmscanc-account-for-memory-already-freed-in-seeking-to.patch.  It has other
stuff in it which we might still need.  But altering sc->swap_cluster_max
in that manner looks odd.
From: Andrew Morton <akpm@osdl.org>
At the end of shrink_all_memory() we forget to recalculate lru_pages: it can
be zero.
Fix that up, and add a helper function for this operation too.
Also, recalculate lru_pages each time around the inner loop to get the
balancing correct.
