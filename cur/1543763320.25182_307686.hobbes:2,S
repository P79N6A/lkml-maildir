That's because I don't think that swsusp_write is a proper place for
it ;) It looks like a lean and mean function that does just write and
manipulating usermodehelper state _and_ system (device) state is
wrong. Let it do one thing, don't overload with actions that I think
belong to the upper level. Do you agree?
I think I need to stick in usermodehelper_enable call in case
swsusp_write fails though.
