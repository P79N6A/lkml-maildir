Well, then you have no idea about how the current LVM code works.  The
way it does everything is to read the data from disk, convert endianness
and such, and then pass it to the kernel via IOCTL.  I have no comment
on whether this is a good or bad way to do it.  The point is that the
struct marked "core" which you are deleting this unused field from is
filled in from user-space, so you can't just change it when you want.
Rather than spending a lot of time breaking the kernel/user interface
and forcing everyone using LVM to update their user tools, just leave
this field in the struct.  Feel free to remove the actual code that
does the read-ahead if you want, but leave the lv_read_ahead field
in this struct alone.  The entire LVM code is going to be replaced
by either LVM2 (just entered beta) or EVMS (in beta for a while now).
Cheers, Andreas
