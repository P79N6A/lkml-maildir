You kind of answered your own question before you asked it, but let me 
try and clarify my view. Two things:
1. We generally try and implement things in userspace where possible and 
where it makes sense at least to a certain degree. Or at least, you only 
get USB stuff included in the kernel when you have convinced Greg it 
belongs there (which you may have already done).
2. As you acknowledge, only a certain subset of all USB fingerprint 
reader drivers will be implemented in the kernel, therefore providing 
the abstraction at kernel level is inadequate (you leave the pure 
userspace drivers out of the loop, therefore getting people to actually 
use your interface will be difficult). You may argue that your proposal 
doesn't limit itself to fingerprint readers, but neither does my answer: 
many USB devices (of other types) are supported purely in userspace.

Sounds like you are talking about reimplementing HAL at this point. I 
don't think this argument justifies including it at kernel level (but 
neither does it oppose it).

If the kernel doesn't *need* to know about the properties and doesn't 
act on them, why? And what about the devices that the kernel doesn't 
handle, where they are operated purely through userspace?

That's not what I'm suggesting - many classes of drivers belong in 
kernel space and would incur major brain damage if moved to userspace.
You might want to go back a year or two and read the discussions when 
the USB scanner driver was moved out of the kernel and reimplemented 
100% inside libsane. There are other examples as well.

It's not their decision while they aren't the ones writing the drivers.

idmouse is the only fingerprint reader driver in the Linux kernel that I 
know of. There are a number of other devices supported in userspace.
