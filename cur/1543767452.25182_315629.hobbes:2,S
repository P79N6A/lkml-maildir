hai,
       I want to stuff the characters received on a serial line into the 
keyboard buffer, so that they will be send to applications as if they are 
coming from keyboard irrespective of console or x-windows mode.
       For this purpose, I planned to use ioctls. Can anybody tell how to 
send an ioctl to keyboard driver?
       AFAIK, tty_flip_buffer is the buffer from which both console and 
x-windows will take input. If we insert into this buffer, I think the 
purpose will be served. Now the question is how to send ioctl to this 
buffer.
   can you please give any suggestions on this?
   Thanks&Regards,
   P.Manohar,
