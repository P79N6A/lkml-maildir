Yes. But the API isn't set in stone, as that would slow down
development. Plus you need the machinery to build whatever pieces are
extant and ignore the rest, you have to carve up the whole into separate
pieces, ... This is a *lot* of work for very minimal gain and many future
problems.

I don't see how chopping up the kernel will speed up development. Quite to
the contrary, any change has to be propagated to all pieces, and that will
take more time, and create a nightmare of "drivers bar-0.37.2 to 0.39.6 go
with kernel-core 2.9.45 to 2.9.76, but work only with foo-3.65.x".
Syncronization issues arise by the distributed development, which are now
trivially solved by "this is _the_ official version of _all_ there is".

*Very* bad practice, I may add.

So what? 2.4.0-test is experimental, you can't assume stuff will work at
all. This is not just "drop working 2.4.0-test9 <foo> into
2.4.0-test10-pre3", if it broke there is a reason that makes it not work
anymore. I tend to doubt the USB people submmited a patch to break
it... When 2.4.0 ships, everything should work; then you can complain. But
to get there, folks _must_ make an effort to fold the latest working,
tested patches into the kernel ASAP. Then again, they are all volunteers...
