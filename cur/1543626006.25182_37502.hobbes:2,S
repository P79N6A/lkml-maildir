Ok.  How about my laptop?  I have an ATAPI zip drive I can plug
in instead of a second battery.  It is the only device on the
second IDE bus (hdc).  In windows there is a little hotplug
utility thing one runs before unplugging the zip drive.  In Linux
I currently have to reboot if I want the ide-floppy driver to see
the device...  I'm willing to bet that Dell has done mysterious
stuff to make the electrical part work.  It would sure be nice if
I could ask the ide driver to kindly re-scan for /dev/hdc now.
Is whatever windows is doing when I hotplug my zip drive somehow
unsafe, such that supporting the same functionality on Linux is
somehow a Bad Thing(tm)?
