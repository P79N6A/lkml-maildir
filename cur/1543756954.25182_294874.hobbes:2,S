Swapouts aren't the problem. The swapins with physical readahead are the
ones that benefits from the reduced overall fragmentation. Or at least
this was the case in 2.4, you're right something might be different now
that we don't follow a swapout virtual address space order anymore (but
there is probably still some localization effect during the ->nopage
faults).
