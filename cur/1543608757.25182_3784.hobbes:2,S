I don't have documentation on when Cray's NFSv3 server will return
NFSERR_JUKEBOX, but since inodes aren't migrated to tape I don't
think it is likely on other than read and non-truncate write with
no prior read. Our applications are unlikely to do the latter.
Maybe there is a subset of servers for which the patch is OK, and
we could make that clear in the help for the config option. I'll
ask Cray for clarification about their server.
