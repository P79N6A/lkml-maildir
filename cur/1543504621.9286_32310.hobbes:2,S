I have a server dualPII450 with 1 gig of RAM, and during the boot it says:
Linux version 2.2.7
#2 SMP Mon May 3 11:23:36 CEST 1999
Warning only 960MB will be used.
What is that "epsilon" thing, and what is the reason that it doesn't use
the full amount of RAM?
I'm sorry if I should know this.. If so, _please_ point me to the
documentation. 
Thanx!
