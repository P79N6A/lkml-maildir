I'm trying to install Debian (with 2.2.1 kernel) on a SPARCstation 2,
and I'm seeing the following error:
esp0: IRQ 3 SCSI ID 7 Clk 20 Mhz CCF=4 TOut 167 NCR53C90A (esp100a)
ESP: Total of 1 ESP hosts found, 1 actually in use
scsi0: Sparc ESP100A (NCR53C90A)
scsi: 1 host
esp0: Warning, live target 0 not responding to selection
The last line repeats forever.  Has anyone seen this problem before?
Any way out?
Please cc me on any responses to the mailing list.
Thanks,
    Max
