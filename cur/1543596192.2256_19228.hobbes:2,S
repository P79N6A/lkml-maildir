Just FYI.(maybe worthless without ksymoops report)
My ThinkPad 600X(Coppermine 500 MHZ, 100 MHZ SDRAM 320 MB, NeoMagic 256Z
Video chipset, UDMA3 IDE hdd, cardbus IBM Etherjet 10/100 - Xircom oem,
tulip 21143 compatible, external mii tranceiver - Cirrus CS46XX sound
chipset) was completely locked up the system  while loading yenta_socket
and other modules.
But, Mr. David Hinds' pcmcia-cs-3.1.26(i82365, tulip_cs) always works well.
This was the first time for me to try to experiment with built-in pcmcia
support of regular linux kernel after 2.4.0 kernel was released.
I have been using only pcmcia-cs-3.1.2x since I bought 600X in Dec 2000,
because pcmcia drivers of 2.4.0-testX kernel doesn't worked wel at that
time.
I use kernel-2.4.3-ac22, gcc-2.96-88, binutils-2.11.90.0.19, glibc-2.2.3,
XFree86-4.1.0, ..).
