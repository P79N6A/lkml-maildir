I use the forcedeth driver for my nVidia ethernet successfully with 
kernel 2.6.6.  I recently tested 2.6.7-rc1, and when using it the 
ethernet does not work, and I see this in dmesg:
eth1: forcedeth.c: subsystem: 01043:80a7 bound to 0000:00:04.0
NETDEV WATCHDOG: eth1: transmit timed out
NETDEV WATCHDOG: eth1: transmit timed out
NETDEV WATCHDOG: eth1: transmit timed out
NETDEV WATCHDOG: eth1: transmit timed out
NETDEV WATCHDOG: eth1: transmit timed out
I can ping localhost and the device's IP number, but I cannot ping 
other systems' IP numbers.
Thanks.
Lee.
