I'm sorry, but I fail to understand your reasoning behind this statement.
Could you please clarify?  How is a driver which presents a traditional
major/minor number interface affected by the presence of a devfs (which,
presumably, uses a different interface to the driver).

A driver is different from what?  Please clarify.  I'm having great
difficulty understanding how this paragraph applies to the one before it,
and how it is supposed to refute danielt's statement.  Where is the
'kitchen-sink mentality' to which you refer?
