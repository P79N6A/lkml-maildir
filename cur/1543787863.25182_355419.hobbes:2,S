Subject: "Kernel panic: VRKADINT" under heavy I/O.  What is the source or location of VRKADINT

Greetings,
    I have several systems that will hang under heavy i/o. This usually 
occurs during a Pallas AllToAll test over Infiniband. Is anyone able to 
point me to where I can find VRKADINT or what general area of the kernel 
this is coming from? Everything runs fine otherwise. When I start the 
AllToAll across 32 machines and get 128 cores all talking to each other 
at once random machines will panic with the VRKADINT. I cannot seem to 
find this message anywhere in kernel source.
details:
arch   x86_64
kernel  2.6.5-7.193-smp (SuSE Ent9)
proc  2x dual core Opteron 275
ram 16GB
