Just out of curiousity, how does Beowulf handle
devices across nodes?
Seems like it would have comparable issues
to deal with, and if they were using devfs
in its present form we would have heard a lot
about it by now (remembering Beowulf user input
into the old network latency under load
discussions.)
Is the Beowulf code still online, open source,
etc?
