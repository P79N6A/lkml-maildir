I meant that you can originate to move the OSS entry point to somewhere 
else (library) and try to persuade developers to use library than direct 
calls.
Of course, we cannot change current applications, but we can start the 
movement now. I just ask you to do it now. Nothing else. It will be a slow 
process but it should be started now.
Also, I don't think that it will break something. The application 
developers can use your code in their applications directly when the 
distribution does not have the OSS access library package.
Note that your words clearly states your attitude to change something.
