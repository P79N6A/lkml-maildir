How about this? The first part is a spelling fix.

+Q: Are there any security issues that I should be aware of?
+A: When using dynamic device numbers, a given pair of major/minor numbers may
+   point to different hardware over time. If a user has permission to access a
+   specific device node directly and is able to create hard links to this node,
+   he or she can do so to create a copy of the device node. When the device is
+   unplugged and udev removes the device node, the user's copy remains.
+   If the device node is later recreated with different permissions the hard 
+   link can still be used to access the device using the old permissions.
+   (The same problem exists when using PAM to change permissions on login.)
+    
+   The simplest solution is to prevent the creation of hard links by putting
+   /dev in a separate filesystem (tmpfs, ramfs, ...).

 Q: I have other questions about udev, where do I ask them?
 A: The linux-hotplug-devel mailing list is the proper place for it.  The
    address for it is linux-hotplug-devel@lists.sourceforge.net
