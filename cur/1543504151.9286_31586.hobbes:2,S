I tried the 2.3.11 patch on a vanilla 2.3.11 kernel.
"ls -l" and "cd" worked but when I tried to read files
I got only nullbytes instead of the actual file content.
E.g. "less" produced 416 nullbytes on a 416 byte long
textfile. The partition was rw mounted.
I use egcs-19990718 and binutils-2.9.5.0.3.
Regards,
Zoltan
