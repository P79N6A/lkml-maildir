Thanks for the report.  I'm still searching for something useful
to say.  I've recently spent several days trying to deduce what's
behind such page_remove_rmap BUGs, but not yet come up with any
convincing hypothesis.  Yours is the first I've seen without
CONFIG_PREEMPT, so that's another potential culprit exonerated.
Some things which _might_ help me to shed more light on your case:
outputs of "objdump -rd" on your mm/memory.o, mm/rmap.o, kernel/exit.o;
and "cat /proc/$(pidof transcode)/maps" while transcode is running.
The atomic counter underflow in do_exit does suggest corruption
elsewhere than in transcode's page table (though I'm not at all
sure that is corrupt) - as always, it is worth giving memtest86
a thorough run to check your memory.
Thanks,
Hugh
