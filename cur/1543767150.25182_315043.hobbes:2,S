This is the first I've ever heard of any such leak, more likely
the leak is in the networking code somewhere.

It only happens with OS-X and it has to do with how they handle the fast
path of TCP input.  It's a known problem but no satisfatory solution
exists yet.  When the fast path in OS-X TCP input is hit, they always
delay ACKs by a full 500ms, there isn't much Linux can do about broken
behavior like that.
We are thinking of possible workarounds, but this bug is very low priority
since it is really a MAC OS-X issue.
Anyways, I'm in Chicago until Monday so won't be able to look into anything
in detail until then.
