The Maxtor drive I mentioned earlier worked fine on a ULI AHCI controller with 
NCQ enabled for the few hours I used Linux on that machine for recovering 
purposes.... So I wouldn't want a global balcklist.
BTW, I now have 4 Seagate ST3320620AS on the MCP51, mostly in raid5 and they 
work fine with NCQ enabled and the second patch you/your co-worker posted.
Cheers,
