I have the following problem with audio:
Xmms is running with threads for audio and spectrum
analyzer(OpenGL).
The audio eats 5% cpu, the spectrum analyzer about 80 %. The
problem is that sometimes the spectrum analyzer is eating all of
the cpu while the audio is skipping. Xmms is version 1.2.10
kernel is vanilla, latest "stable" version 2.6.12, suid root.
Does your benchmark simultes this kind of behaviour ?
