I've been meaning to investigate - for me quitting X causes the machine
to just die completely. On two of my test boxes. I'm suspecting that
may be frame buffer related however.
There shouldn't be any patches in my tree to the input stuff any more,
so I'm a little puzzled. There are some console bits that I should 
probably just drop though.

Yep, I spotted those too. They only started appearing recently,
not sure what the meaning of them is.
