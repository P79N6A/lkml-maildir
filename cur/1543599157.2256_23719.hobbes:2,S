    1. how to find problematic blocks?
           - just read, and if read fails goto 2.
	     (i.e. we found no new bad sectors)
	   - goto 2 on the sectors reported before as bad.
             (i.e. drive remembers sectors on which he had failures)
    2. what to do when i found problematic sector?
           - just see if it still usable.
         2a. i write to the sector, and after that i read crap.
               - sector is bad! should remap it!
         2b. i can write data to the sector, then reads goes ok.
               - hmm, i think that was kinda magnetetic storm, sector
 is still usable. do not remapping.
        in my case there was just magnetic storm, so the sector can be safely
     read/written again.
cheers,
Sam
