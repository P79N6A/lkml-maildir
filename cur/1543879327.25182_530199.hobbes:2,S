Perhaps we can add "atomic_t xxx" to task_struct.
	int freezing(struct task_struct *p)
	{
		return test_tsk_thread_flag(p, TIF_FREEZE)
			&& atomic_read(&p->xxx) == 0;
	}
	void xxx_start(struct task_struct *p)
	{
		atomic_inc(p->xxx);
		thaw_process(p);
	}
	xxx_end(struct task_struct *p)
	{
		atomic_dec(p->xxx);
	}
Now,
	xxx_start(p);
	... wait for something which depends on p...
	xxx_end(p);
Of course we need other changes, freeze_process() should check ->xxx, etc.
I am not sure this makes sense.
Oleg.
