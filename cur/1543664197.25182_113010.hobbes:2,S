I think you are a little late with these workarounds, tg3 1.4c
is available for a week already.

People using ancient non-NAPI kernels better upgrade to 2.4.20.
If they really, really, really cannot upgrade (and this only
happens when they are stuck with binary module crap), they
should say "I will quit this tob tomorrow" three times,
then use RH AS2.1 driver, only make sure to get tg3 1.2e3
from drivers/addon/tg3 in 2.4.9-e.12.
