That's because they just look like any other process/thread.  They just
execute forever in kernel mode (as if they were in a never-ending system
call), so they don't need any user-mode address space.  There is no
other difference.

No, they are scheduled just like any other process.  Some kernel threads
might artificially raise their priority, but user processes can do the
same too.

Sure!
