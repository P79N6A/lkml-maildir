Of course this is true, but I think this very one is an exception: this 
is the only one seen when booting with the "quiet" kernel option or 
using some shiny bootlogo patches, both of which is common practice 
among distribution-shipped kernels.

No, it does not yields any reduction. Only the strings itself are 
changed, not the time they are printed.
Besides, nobody is interested that actually an uncompress step is in 
progress, that just works. And, btw if it fails (the gunzip), it prints 
an error message anyway iirc.
