Ah, yes, thanks for pointing this out.
PCI_DMA_BUS_IS_PHYS (and it's description) is quite misleading: it
claims that it has something to do with there being an equivalence
between PCI bus and physical addresses.  That's actually the case for
(small) ia64 platforms so that's why we ended up setting it to 1.
