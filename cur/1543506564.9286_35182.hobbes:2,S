  Hello.
  So I've hopefully fixed those memleaks in my new quota code.
  Last patch should be available on 
ftp://atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/pub/local/jack
  as quota-patch-2.3.13.diff.gz. The server isn't currently connected but
  it should be on Monday morning (GMT) at latest.
  New utilities should be there too as quota-2.00.tar.gz
		Honza.
