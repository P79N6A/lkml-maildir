ACK technical content, but it needs one revision:  like someone else 
(Alan or Tejun?) mentioned, this patch should be revised to use a 
separate ata_port_operations for the affected chip(s).
Copy ahci_ops to sb600_ops, add your check-atapi-dma function without 
the vendor/device ID check.  Move the vendor/device check to the 
pci_device_id table by creating a board_ahci_sb600 constant and 
associated table data.
I agree with other posters that we should move the revision check to 
more generic code, but such a move should not block this patch.  The two 
efforts can occur in parallel.
