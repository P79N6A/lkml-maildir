OK, point taken.  I don't have a strong preference for the opposite
model, it just seems elegant that you can let user space handle
allocation and pin and map the pages as needed.  But you're right, it
certainly is easier to give safe memory to user space in the first
place rather than try to make sure user space isn't trying to trick
us.

Ah, I'm not mmap'ing it from the ioctl, I do implement the mma file
operation for this.  However, you have to do an ioctl before mapping
the device to configure the dma context.
Other than that what is the problem with ioctls, and more interesting,
what is the alternative?  I don't expect (or want) a bunch of syscalls
to be added for this, so I don't really see what other mechanism I
should use for this.

That sounds a lot like what I have now (mmap method, array of pages)
so I'll just stick with that.
thanks,
