I missed this warning as i don't have irda enabled in my config.
A simple fix would be to rename the macro in sctp.h to
SCTP_MSECS_TO_JIFFIES.

I am not seeing these errors with either gcc3.2.2 or gcc2.96. But, looking at the
code, this definitely seems to be a problem. Not sure why the newer versions of
gcc didn't catch them.
looks like while backporting from 2.6, i missed the fact that in 2.4, fl6_src,
fl6_dst in struct flowi are pointers to struct in6_addr.
I will work on a patch to fix these issues shortly.
Thanks
