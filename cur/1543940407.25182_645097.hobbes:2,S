Subject: sections mismatches: How to mark new false positives?

I'm getting the following in the latest -git:
<--  snip  -->
...
WARNING: arch/x86/kernel/built-in.o(.exit.text+0x1db): Section mismatch in reference from the function msr_exit() to the variable .cpuinit.data:msr_class_cpu_notifier
...
<--  snip  -->
That's obviously a false positive (unregister_hotcpu_notifier() is a 
noop if CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU=n), but how can I silence the warning?
