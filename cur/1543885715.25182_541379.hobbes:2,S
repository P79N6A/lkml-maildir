I know that and I have talked to manufacturers.  Not allowing direct
access is common practice today, but I didn't encounter much opposition
against allowing it in the future.  What appears to be holding them back
is that there would be absolutely no value in it right now.  With direct
flash access, which filesystem should users choose for their 32GB SSD?

It doesn't.  Motivation 2 is about SSDs, USB sticks, SD-Cards, etc.
JFFS2 is motivation 1.

It is not very high on my priority list.

Maybe.  My view is that I have to solve any problems found until people
consider the code good enough by whatever metric.  The final criterium
appears to be quite fuzzy.

On NOR hardware?  How many write/erase failures does one commonly
encounter there?  Those things will need to get sorted, sure.  But
I doubt whether LogFS is useless on _all_ hardware because of this.

Sure.

Common problem.  Implementor doesn't know what comments would be useful
and reviewer doesn't know where to start without useful comments.  I
will try to add some and would love to see suggestions.

It does.  But I don't have a coverity license, just to give one example.
