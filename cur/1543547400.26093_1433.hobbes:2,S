It just does not seem to be needed. The remote gdb stub is so simple
that it is probably not worth it (it just reads packets from the serial
line and executes very simple commands like read memory etc.). I don't
see much point in debugging that.

No doubt.  I admit even gdb support for that is very poor (=non existent),
but the Linux strategy of avoiding problems with that by using very
simple locking seems to have worked reasonably so far.
