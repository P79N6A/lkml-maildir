i am testing fc3 by using an old-school initrd. by old-school i mean not
the new initramfs/cpio type initrd. the process i use to create the
initrd works for all other distributions (suse, mandrake, debian, fc2,
2.2.x, 2.4.x, 2.6.x, etc) but fails with fc3 (2.6.9-1.667).
upon system boot, the kernel executes, checks to see if the initrd is
initramfs (it isnt), finds the initrd (ext2), mounts it, and then
immediately exits without executing linuxrc.
anyone have any ideas as to why linuxrc is not being executed?
