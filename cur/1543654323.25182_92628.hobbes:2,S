How is your virtual machine configured? Do you use
/dev/sg* for generic access to your SCSI, or
/dev/sr* for accessing your CD drive from virtual machine? 
In that case, try disconnecting this hardware from guest before
using cdrecord. It is quite possible that your cdwriter gets mad
if you are recording and at same time Windows try to detect whether
you changed medium inside writer...
Not that aic7xxx driver should panic due to that, but...
