You can argue against it, but it doesn't change the fact that 
get_unmapped_area is a significant user of CPU on a KDE startup. You
can do the oprofile yourself if you don't believe me. And where else should 
it come from other than from mapping shared libraries ?
This includes X server startup, but at least my X has a much shorter
/proc/*/maps than a KDE program, so I don't think X is a significant
consumer of vmas.
