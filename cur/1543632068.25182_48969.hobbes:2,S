Enough said. Business is business, bottom line. Coding in open source
is artwork. These guys building this kernel are artists. Those guys
selling stuff are business people. So, you want to use my artwork for
money? Fine, then pay me to let someone have the privilege. Want to
help me paint parts of the memory handling? Fine, here's a paint brush
all your own... totally free.
