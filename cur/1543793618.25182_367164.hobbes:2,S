Sure, alternatives_smp() puts both versions into the 
.altinstr_replacement section because of that ;)
The idea is to have SMP compiled in and let the normal 
apply_alternatives() handle the SMP->UP patching case using the new 
feature bit.  apply_alternatives_smp() handles UP->SMP patching when you 
plug in a new virtual CPU.
