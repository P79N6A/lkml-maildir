Nope, this approach is what I was talking about.  There are some minor 
issues discussed below but they should be easy/quick to fix.

I've looked at this before from a SELinux point of view to see if I 
could get rid of this extra memory allocation/copy and there just isn't 
a clean way to do it ("clean" being very subjective).  The problem is 
you either have to hold the policy lock while you make the NetLabel 
call (not a good idea), move the selinux_netlbl_sock_setsid() 
functionality back into security/selinux/ss/services.c (not desired by 
the SELinux folks who like to keep the selinux/ss/ directory minimal), 
or do the allocatin in security_netlbl_sid_to_secattr() and free it in 
selinux_netlbl_sock_setsid().  Of those options, only the last is 
really possible and it's so prone to memory leakage that I'm hesitant 
to say it's better than what we currently have.  Right now you do a 
call to netlbl_secattr_init() to start, do what you want with the 
secattr, and then you call netlbl_secattr_destroy() which will clean up 
_everything_ so nothing is leaked.  It works out really well because 
all of the _secattr_init() calls are matched by _secattr_destroy() 
calls within the same function; very easy to quickly scan and ensure 
there are no problems (the memory leak for a few weeks ago was quickly 
caught by looking at the code).  I'm in no hurry to loose this handy 
little property of the secattr, although I do agree that it isn't 
optimal for SMACK at present.  On the plus side this only happens once 
per-socket and not per-packet so I don't expect the malloc/copy to be 
fatal at this point.
You've got my mind revisiting this idea so give me a while and let me 
see if I can think of something that should be palatable to everyone 
involved.  In the meantime, I think you should fixup the few little 
nits in this patch and get it merged as it is a nice improvement and 
something that I believe most SMACK users will want.

You should try and populate the 'audit_info' struct with actual info so 
the generated audit record is more useful for people who care about 
those things.  It's only two fields, 'secid' and 'loginuid', which are 
pretty self-explanatory.

There is still the potential for a race here between when you change 
the 'smack_net_ambient' value and when you actually change the NetLabel 
configuration as you still allow new sockets to be created/labeled 
regardless of the 'smack_ambient_lock'.  That said, considering that 
this is a privileged operation and one that I don't expect to be very 
frequent it's probably not a big deal, I just wanted to make sure you 
were aware of that.

Should have noticed this sooner, how about replacing the above two lines 
with the following?
 nlsp->flags = NETLBL_SECATTR_DOMAIN | NETLBL_SECATTR_MLS_LVL;

Not quite ... NetLabel will take care of making sure things are labeled 
correctly (default vs. ambient) but it can still fail for a variety of 
reasons: memory pressure, labeling protocol cannot represent the 
security attributes you passed, etc.  Moral of the story, you still 
need to check the return value of netlbl_sock_setattr() and deal with 
failures in a sane manner.

You can keep the above if-statement if you like, but NetLabel handles 
this case gracefully (if it doesn't let me know, it's a bug) so it 
isn't necessary.
