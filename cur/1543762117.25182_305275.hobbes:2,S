volatile is almost always (a) buggy, or (b) hiding bugs.  At the very 
least, barriers are usually needed.
Almost every case really wants to be inside a spinlock, or atomic_t, or 
similarly protected.
Specifically for SATA, I am making the presumption that SCSI is smart 
enough not to mess with host_failed until my error handler completes.
