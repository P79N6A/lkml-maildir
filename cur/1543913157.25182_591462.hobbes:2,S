A look at the 'cpuidle' branch of git-acpi shows a commit
e40cede7d63a029e92712a3fe02faee60cc38fb4, "cpuidle: first
round of documentation updates" that doesn't show up in that
branch online. The entire Documentation/cpuidle directory
is missing from the tree when looking at the web pages, and
it's missing from git-acpi.patch in 2.6.23-rc4-mm1 (but the
patch shows up in the summary information in the patch
header.) Where did it go? And how can -mm be used to test
things if its patches don't even match their own headers?
