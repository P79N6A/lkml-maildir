There's a BIG difference:  the standard Unix password hashes are never
used as encryption keys.  The only thing they are useful for (to an
authentication program or password cracker) is for comparision (when
verifying a plaintext password).  This is not the case with SMB hashes.

The inherent problem with traditional, secret-key cryptography is the
fact that there must be a shared secret.  When using encrypted SMB
passwords the secret is the hash which is stored on disk.  When using
plaintext SMB (or telnet, ftp...) the shared secret is the actual
password.
