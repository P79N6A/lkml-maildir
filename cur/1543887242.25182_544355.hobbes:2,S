It really looks like amd76x_pm is causing the time loss.  Sadly, I have
no idea how to avoid this.  What happens when the pm-timer wraps around
while the processors are in C3 sleep state?  How is this wrap detected
at all?  Is there anything I could put into amd76x_pm?  It's no problem
detecting a timer wrap there.
