I gave other clocksources a try:
morte st3 # cat /sys/devices/system/clocksource/clocksource0/available_clocksource
acpi_pm pit jiffies tsc
Setting tsc as current clocksource:
morte st3 # echo tsc > /sys/devices/system/clocksource/clocksource0/current_clocksource
[13367.729060] Time: tsc clocksource has been installed.
didn't fix anything. Other weirdness here: it looks like it affects my
typematic delay and repeat rate.
Setting jiffies or pit as current clocksource didn't fix anything, but at
least it doesn't cause anything bad.
Do you want me to comment out adjust_jiffies() and see what happens?
