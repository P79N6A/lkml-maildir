Yeah, but nothing which'll make your NIC work ;)
Please send me a copy of the `lspci -xxx' output for the device.
To do this, first run `lspci' with no args, to get this:
00:00.0 Host bridge: Intel Corporation 440BX/ZX - 82443BX/ZX Host bridge (rev 03)
00:01.0 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation 440BX/ZX - 82443BX/ZX AGP bridge (rev 03)
00:02.0 CardBus bridge: Texas Instruments PCI1450 (rev 03)
00:02.1 CardBus bridge: Texas Instruments PCI1450 (rev 03)
00:03.0 Ethernet controller: 3Com Corporation 3c556B Laptop Hurricane (rev 20)
00:03.1 Communication controller: 3Com Corporation: Unknown device 1007 (rev 20)
00:05.0 Multimedia audio controller: Cirrus Logic CS 4614/22/24 [CrystalClear SoundFusion 
...
And then run
	lspci -xxx -s 00:03.0
Where the bus/slot/function identifiers refer to the 3com
device.  (Running lspci -xxx against all PCI devices is risky.)
