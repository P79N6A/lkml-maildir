I think the comment is wrong and the lock_kernel is superfluous. See

This should not lead to a crash:
1) sys_shmget does not give you access to the resource but only the
   identifier.
2) shmat is using vfs to get access to the object.
3) sys_shmctl(IPC_RMID) calls vfs to do the unlink
So we should end up having an unlinked shm segment with attachee. This
is somewhat unexpected but it should not be fatal.
But you are right that the big kernel lock does not prevent from that
since it is released by down(&shm_ids.sem). So we can also just remove
the lock and put it directly around do_unlink
