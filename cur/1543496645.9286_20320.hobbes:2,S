They are distributing systems using the driver - hence they're distributing 
binaries.

From looking at the driver in question, and playing with the hardware, I'd 
guess that they're trying extremely hard to avoid releasing details of just 
how much the hardware sucks. As far as I can tell, the thing works by passing 
a byte at a time through a single mem-mapped address. Lovely on an Alpha :)
The previous Disk-On-Chip devices were much like EMM - paging a 4Kb chunk of 
flash into the window and letting you access it directly. We could actually 
get reasonable performance out of them, unlike the new ones.
Nonetheless, work is progressing on a GPL'd driver for them. I can now read
what looks like a filesystem off the device - but it doesn't look like FTL, so
I can't (yet) decipher it - but I can see 512-byte chunks of files I know are
on the disk.
Anyone who's interested in getting the things to work, join the mailing list 
'echo subscribe mtd | mail majordomo@imladris.demon.co.uk' and help out, or 
just keep yourself informed.
