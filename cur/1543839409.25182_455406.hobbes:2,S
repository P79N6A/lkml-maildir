Kirill,
IMO, a UBC with resource constraint(limit in this case) should behave no
different than a kernel with limited memory. i.e it should do
reclamation before it starts failing allocation requests. It could even
do it preemptively.
There is no guarantee support which is required for providing QoS.
Each controller modifying the infrastructure code doesn't look good. We
can have proper interfaces to add a new resource controller.
