One substantial advantage of cpusets (as in the kernel patch in *-mm's
tree), over variations that "just poke the affinity masks from user
space" is the task->cpuset pointer.  This tracks to what cpuset a task
is attached.  The fork and exit code duplicates and nukes this pointer,
managing the cpuset reference counter.
It matters to batch schedulers and the like which cpuset a task is in,
and which tasks are in a cpuset, when it comes time to do things like
suspend or migrate the tasks currently in a cpuset.
Just because it's ok to share a little compute time in a cpuset doesn't
mean you don't care to know who is in it.
