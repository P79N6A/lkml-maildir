Hi Michael,
It is better to assume that he has done the checks and then do the checks
to convince yourself (as they say in russia "doverjaj no proverjaj" -
"trust but always double-check").
So, I now went fs/ext2/ialloc.c and did that for you - ext2_new_inode()
does indeed set err accordingly and amongst its possible returns, there is
infact EDQUOT.
Regards,
Tigran
