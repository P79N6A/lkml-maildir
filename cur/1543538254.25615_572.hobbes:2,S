I don't have POSIX at hand, but does it not also specify exec() from a
signal handler is OK?  I am pretty sure it does.  In this case, the new
image has the "current" signal blocked.  Is this proper?  It seems obtuse that
a process would have to do sigemptyset() and sigprocmask()  before exec().
comments?  should we perhaps clear the 'current' signal from the mask, or
is that just overinterpreting?
