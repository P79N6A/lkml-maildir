	I have a number with 8M, a couple with 16M, and one with 4M.

	I also find this very distressing as two of my routers have 8M of ram
while another has 4M, and both perform fairly well while doing any number of
things.  My secondary name server and secondary mail server also has 8M of ram.
	If this can't be changed for 2.2.0 (Anyone know what's causing it?),
perhaps in 2.2.1?  Or maybe some option ("low mem?") that will turn off memory
hogs and go back to prior slower but less memory eating routines?  If this is
possible?
