I'm running oom whether I have swap enabled or not.  The inactive
dirty list starts growing forever, until it's full of (aparantly)
dirty pages and I'm utterly oom.
With swap enabled, I keep allocating until there's nothing left.
Actual space usage is roughly 30mb (of 256mb), but when you can't
allocate anymore you're toast too, with the same dirt buildup.
