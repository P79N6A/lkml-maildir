I don't suspect that a kernel developer is going to make such an egregious 
error.  The user would need to be using a new linux/mempolicy.h with an 
old kernel to get the wrong behavior.

That looks overly redundant to me and doesn't protect against adding 
MPOL_YET_ANOTHER_FLAG in the middle of preferred and bind to get two mode 
values with the int value of 1.
