Every page replacement system has a worst case, 2.5 is closer to
LRU than 2.4 and it's well possible that the randomisation 2.4
does means we don't trigger the worst case here.
I don't know for sure, but I have a feeling that EVERY algorithm
for page replacement can be tricked into performing worse than
random page replacement for some particular workload.  It might
even be provable ;)

No competition ?  I know _I_ don't have a machine dedicated to
gimp and I like to be able to continue listening to mp3s while
the gimp is chewing on a large image...
