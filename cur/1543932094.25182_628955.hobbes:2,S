Of course, I assume whitelisting.
SELinux and TOMOYO Linux and many other MAC implementations uses
whitelisting approach, and this filesystem is whiltelisting approach.
This filesystem handles what MAC implementations don't handle.
In other words, it is a remaining hole.
I'm proposing:
 Don't you think it is dangerous to assume files in /dev directory
 have appropriate filename and attributes binding?
 MAC can restrict processes who can create files in /dev directory,
 but MAC doesn't enforce filename and attributes binding.
 So, how about enforcing filename and attributes binding in filesystem layer?
Regards.
