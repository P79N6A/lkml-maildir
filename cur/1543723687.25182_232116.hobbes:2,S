Actually the problem sits deeper.  sk98line tries to register a procfile with
the interfacename of the struct net_device.  The patch below (ontop of
the previous one) makes it work unless you change the interface name manually,
but as Linux explicitly allows that the interface is fundamentally broken and
probably should just go away.
