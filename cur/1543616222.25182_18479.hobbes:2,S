Subject: undefined reference to `local symbols in discarded section .text.exit

I have modules and hotplug turned on (but nothing turned on in the
hotplug suboptions) but I get this error anyway:
        /usr/src/linux/arch/i386/lib/lib.a /usr/src/linux/lib/lib.a
/usr/src/linux/arch/i386/lib/lib.a \
        --end-group \
        -o vmlinux
net/network.o(.text.lock+0x1730): undefined reference to `local symbols
in discarded section .text.exit'
make: *** [vmlinux] Error 1
I've tried to track it down but I can't find what is triggering it. This
is with 2.4.18-pre2 with the following net related config options in:
CONFIG_NETDEVICES=y
CONFIG_DUMMY=y
CONFIG_NET_ETHERNET=y
CONFIG_NET_PCI=y
CONFIG_TULIP=y
CONFIG_TULIP_MWI=y
CONFIG_PPP=y
CONFIG_PPP_ASYNC=y
CONFIG_PPP_DEFLATE=y
CONFIG_PPP_BSDCOMP=y
CONFIG_PPPOE=y
CONFIG_PACKET=y
CONFIG_PACKET_MMAP=y
CONFIG_NETLINK_DEV=y
CONFIG_NETFILTER=y
CONFIG_NETFILTER_DEBUG=y
CONFIG_UNIX=y
CONFIG_INET=y
CONFIG_IP_MULTICAST=y
CONFIG_SYN_COOKIES=y
Help? I can't compile 2 kernels cos of this now and I need to with one
of them to try and track down a netfilter bug (this isn't the config
section for that kernel though).
