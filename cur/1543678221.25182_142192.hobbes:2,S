Correct, and this is simple thing is what a lot of anti-KDE folk will
absolutely refuse to accept.

No, the core GNOME and GTK+ libraries are licensed under the terms of
the LGPL. This essentially means closed source works can link to 
these libraries. You can't do that with Qt. Whether this is a positive 
or a negative is not appropriate to discuss here.
Probably surprising to many (based on the proliferation of ignorant remarks 
on various mailing lists), Troll Tech's Qt offering is aligned 
more closely with the FSF philosophy than GTK/GNOME (remember the L in LGPL 
stands for LESSER after all (well the FSF prefers this now, but the 
GNOME/GTK folks continue to use the former version of the license
where the L stands for LIBRARY)).
I think that Qt is a great contribution, but it is misleading to say that 
there is no difference between Qt and GNOME licensing.
