While a sysfs interface is OK and somewhat orthogonal to the interface
proposed the containers patches, I think maybe a new syscall should be
considered.
Since we now have a fair share cpu scheduler, maybe an interface to
specify the cpu share directly (alternatively to priority) make sense.
For processes, it may become more intuitive (and precise) to set the
processing share directly than setting a priority which is converted to
a share.
Maybe something similar to ioprio_set() and ioprio_get() syscalls:
- per user cpu share
- per user group cpu share
- per process cpu share
- per process group cpu share
