It almost certainly has bugs.
Most of the ones present probably don't show up much on an average 
machine, with an average load.
Try the edge cases, such as plugging in twenty thousand USB mice, running
it on a 386/20 with 4Mb ram, unplugging USB devices when in use, ...
The rarer bugs that do present on an average machine, with average loading
just need more people to test, and report oopses or other errors related
to the kernel.
Just running it helps, if only because it lowers the probability of such
bugs being present before 2.6.0 is released.
