After some thinking, you will understand that "timer" and "immediate"
are incompatible. 
TCP just defers such events, look into tcp_timer.c.
Yes, you are right: the problem exists and you can try to
solve this f.e. queueing special control events to backlog.

Because it appeared to be useless overhead. I also believed that
it will be required in tcp, but one day I understood that all the problems
of these kind dissolved. 8)
