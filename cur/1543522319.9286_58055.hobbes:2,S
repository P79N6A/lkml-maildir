<shrug> fine, but I'm less than sure that ll_rw_blk() is the right path -
both for that and for fs/partitions/*. The reason being: ll_rw_blk() does
checking for block size. When we are doing partition reading we have all
buffer_heads dropped and we want to drop the buffer_heads generated in
process of parsing. So I'ld rather have a version of ll_rw_blk() that
would have 512-bytes granularity and ignored the block sizes. Would
simplify the stuff on revalidate() - we are playing interesting games
with setting block size there... Anyway, it's Not For Now(tm).
