Yep.

Well, we already bump up reference count in fork() w/o grabbing those
mutexes don't we? Also if rmdir() sees container->count to be zero, then
it means no task is attached to the container. How will then a function
like bc_file_charge() bump up the reference count to such a container
(presuming it wanted to do so w/o manage/callback mutexes -and- that the
container pointer in bc_file_charge is derived from some task in 
that container). I think it is safe to bump up container->count in
bc_file_charge w/o grabbing manage/callback mutexes.

Are you talking about (un)bind of subsystem to/from hierararchies that
have non-zero containers in them? That sounds very icky. Anyway that
doesnt seem to be supported in current patches.
Basically I felt we should defer introducing css_get/put until we find a good 
user for it, (and bc_file_(un)charge dont seem to be good users of it-
see above).
