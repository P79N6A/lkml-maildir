(I tried a UP kernel yesterday, and even a single kernel build would
make noticeable hitches if I move a window around. YMMV etc.)

I don't think you can have very much effect on latency using nice with
SD once the CPU is fully utilized.  See below.

Nice allocates bandwidth, but as long as the CPU is busy, tasks always
proceed downward in priority until they hit the expired array.  That's
the design.  If X gets busy and expires, and a nice 20 CPU hog wakes up
after it's previous rotation has ended, but before the current rotation
is ended (ie there is 1 task running at wakeup time), X will take a
guaranteed minimum 160ms latency hit (quite noticeable) independent of
nice level.  The only way to avoid it is to use a realtime class.
A nice -20 task has maximum bandwidth allocated, but that also makes it
a bigger target for preemption from tasks at all nice levels as it
proceeds downward toward expiration.  AFAIKT, low latency scheduling
just isn't possible once the CPU becomes 100% utilized, but it is
bounded to runqueue length.  In mainline OTOH, a nice -20 task will
always preempt a nice 0 task, giving it instant gratification, and
latency of lower priority tasks is bounded by the EXPIRED_STARVING(rq)
safety net.
