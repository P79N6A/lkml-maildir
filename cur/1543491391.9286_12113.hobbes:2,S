I am seeing memory problems with 2.2.x and glibc-2.1 also. Some programs
just start eating all available memory and I end up with processes dying
for lack of RAM. I am guessing that this is likely a problem with stuff
linked against glibc-2.0 running under glibc-2.1 since the trouble started
for me right after upgrading libc. This is a Debian slink system with some
parts of potato. The systems running glibc-2.0 have not exhibited this
problem. I have also started seeing filesystem problems on that system as
well. Files seem to evaporate into thin air.
