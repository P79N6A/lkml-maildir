Summit has it's own mach_mpspec.h, so it won't even see the summit
changes you're proposing in mach-default:
+++ q1mm2/include/asm-i386/mach-generic/mach_mpspec.h	2004-01-13 
[...]
+#if defined(CONFIG_X86_SUMMIT) || defined(CONFIG_X86_GENERICARCH)
Putting summit specific pieces in the subarch default is the wrong way
to do it (and for this patch, it's even unnecessary since you modify the
summit mach_mpspec.h anyway).
