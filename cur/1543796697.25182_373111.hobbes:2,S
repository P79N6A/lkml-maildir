I disagree.  I think that has long since become the intent
of EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL().
If the GPL covers interface linkages (whether static or
dynamic) then EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL is redundant.  If it does
not, in all cases, then EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL is, as
an extension to GPL, therefore a GPL violation.
I believe there are cases where an interface could
be deemed not coverable by the GPL.  Putting
EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL around it would be an attempt
to extend GPL to where it otherwise might not reach.
DISCLAIMER: I'm not speaking for Sony here. Personally
I don't believe that most drivers are derivative works
of the operating systems they run with, and I don't
believe it helps Linux to assert that they are.
But, hey, it's not my kernel, and not my plan for
world domination. ;-)
To the larger argument about supporting binary drivers,
all Arjan manages to prove with his post is that,
if handled in the worst possible way, support for
binary drivers would be a disaster.  Who can disagree
with that?
(I'm really not trolling or trying to start a flame
war here.  It's just my 2 cents.)
