I view it slightly different.  Suppose you produce a device which can
only boot images signed by a certain public key.  In this case, you
can give your users source code, but they can't change it and run it
on the device because the signature does not match.  This is a real
threat to software freedom.
Such technology already exists, see for an example:
<
http://java.sun.com/products/jce/doc/guide/HowToImplAProvider.html>
The reasons for that are entirely obscure (because anyone can obtain a
certificate, there is no kind of quality control) and likely only
related to export regulations.  But a similar approach could be used
elsewhere, to exercise more control over which code can run on a
certain platform.
