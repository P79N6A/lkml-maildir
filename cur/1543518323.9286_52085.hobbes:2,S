Hi Johannes,
There is not test & set operations other than spin_... in my code.
Look at it better and try to find a sequence of operations that stall it.
struct s_nested_lock {
    spinlock_t lock;
    short int pid;
    short int count;
};
#define nested_lock(lock, flags) \
    if (lock->pid == getpid()) { \
        ++lock->count; \
    } else { \
        spin_lock_irqsave(&lock->lock, flags); \
        ++lock->count; \
        lock->pid = getpid(); \
    }
#define nested_unlock(lock, flags) \
    if (--lock->count == 0) { \
        lock->pid = 0; \
        spin_unlock_irqrestore(&lock->lock, flags); \
    }
Cheers,
    Davide.
