Subject: [PATCH] arch/x86/kernel/setup_64.c compile error (MMOTM-2007-11-10-19-05)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I'm using -mm (MMOTM-2007-11-10-19-05) and getting
$ make
  CC      arch/x86/kernel/setup_64.o
arch/x86/kernel/setup_64.c: In function 'setup_arch':
arch/x86/kernel/setup_64.c:420: error: implicit declaration of function 'early_quirks'
That's because the externs for early_quirks() aren't on unless CONFIG_ACPI
is on, but the code in setup_64.c calls early_quirks() if CONFIG_PCI is on
(and early-quirks.c is compiled only if CONFIG_PCI=y).  I'm not sure if the
small fix below is correct, hence no signed-off-by.  But it seems to get the
kernel compiling and linking at least.  Someone should check.
Cheers,
Erez.
