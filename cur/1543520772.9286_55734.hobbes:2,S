Ha? Do you really suggest adding a timeout to recover from the lock-up?
You should _remove_ the lock-up instead of hiding it.
Just copy the code from interruptible_sleep_on(), and add
spin_unlock_irq()/spin_lock_irq() around the schedule() call.
You must unlock _after_ you have set "current->state =
TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE", then the lock-up is gone.
[or you could set current->state before you can cause the interrupt, but
this is extremely dangerous on SMP - the cpu's could reorder the memory
accesses.]
	spin_lock_irq(&device_lock);
	play_with_the_hardware();
	while(!command_finished) {
		current->state = TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE;
		spin_unlock_irq(&device_lock);
		schedule();
		spin_lock_irq(&device_lock);
		if(signal_pending(current)) {
			cancel_command();
			goto out_unlock;
		}
	}
	store_the_result_from_the_hardware();
out_unlock:
	spin_unlock_irq(&device_lock);
isr()
{
    spin_lock_irqsave(&device_lock,flags);
    command_finished = 1;
    wake_up_interruptible(&wait);
    spin_unlock_irqrestore(&device_lock,flags);
}
