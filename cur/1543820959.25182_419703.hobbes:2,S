Also, as it turned out these doesn't do good fair scheduling under some 
curcemstances (with busy loops on SMP) :(. Which was reported to MAEDA.
And it doesn't provide limits. as Andrew noticed already, the 
infrastructe is ok, but without much content (or at least good plan) we 
can end up in the only infrastracture.
I'm also pretty sure, that CPU controller based on timeslice tricks 
behaves poorly on burstable load patterns as well and with interactive 
tasks. So before commiting I propose to perform a good testing on 
different load patterns.
Thanks,
Kirill
