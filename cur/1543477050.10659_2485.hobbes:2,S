Victor,
	By that argument, smalltalk and clos dont have real classes either. C++
does not neccessarily lead to slower code unless you use a lot of late
binding. There are also nice "features" like having object destructors
automatically called on scope exit and so on and so on. These generic
arguments that C is/isNot better than C++ are pointless. You can write
crappy code in either language. C++ has a bunch of handy features but if
people don't understand what costs they incur for what features, it will
lead to slower code. At least nobody wants to reimplement the kernel in java
:-)
