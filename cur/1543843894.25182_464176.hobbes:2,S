Also, the hlist->list changes need to be taken care of for the other
archs too.

Well, that is the jprobes and return probes case. In the case of normal
kprobes, p->pre_handler() should always return 0.
In the case of a jprobe, the setjmp_pre_handler() resets the instruction
pointer to the instrumented routine (same signature as the routine being
jprobed), which later does a jprobe_return(), a placeholder for the
arch-specific trap instruction. We re-enter the kprobe_handler here and
then re-enable preemption via the longjmp_break_handler. As for the
return probe case, since the underlying instruction originally was a nop
(kretprobe_trampoline), we don't need to single-step.
Yes, its a bit convoluted, but we are currently covered for all cases.
