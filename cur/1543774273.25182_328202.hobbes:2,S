check_region() is essentially historical. It used to be that
check_region could fail and request_region did not. Once modules arrived
it becomes possible for drivers to race each other for resources so
request_region now atomically (with respect to itself) checks and if
available allocates a region.
check_region() shouldn't be used except for special cases where you
really want to see a space is free without requesting it. Even then if
you need to do any operation on the space while it is free you need to
request/act/release the region nto check_region for it.
