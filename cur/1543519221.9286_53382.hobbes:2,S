Yep, this fixes the errors, now all compiles fine without any sig 11.
At least building ppp_deflate went ok, now I'll try building perl
and the latest gcc to see what happens, but I'm quite shure that 
they will also build ok.
I want to thank you for spending your time to find and fix the problem, I 
hope this fix will go into the next pre-patch.
