Yes. I suspect that these projects have at least looked at each other, so 
it's probably a problem that has its basis in cdrecord or some "original" 
program.
And yes, opening for reading used to work. After all, you didn't need a 
"write()" system call, and the ioctl functions didn't use to check. It's a 
potential security problem, and one that 2.6.8 fixed, and I don't think 
we're willing to go back to the old setup.
And trust me - I absolutely _hate_ breaking user-level programs. I'd love
to unbreak it from the kernel, but in this case I don't see any
alternatives, really.
