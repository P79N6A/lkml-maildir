Subject: [PATCH] system timer: fix crash in <100Hz system timer
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

The kernel has a divide by zero crash when trying to run the system
timer less than 100Hz.  The problem is x/(HZ/USER_HZ) and related.
Now x*(USER_HZ/HZ) will be used if HZ<USER_HZ.
I'm running the Linux kernel under qemu and went to run a slower
system timer to take less CPU (and battery) on the host.  I found that
the kernel paniced under emulation because of a divide by zero in
three places.  Here is the patch.  The base git was updated today
01-05-2008.  I went for a 20Hz system time by adding config HZ_20 etc
to kernel/Kconfig.hz.  With this patch I verified the system timer by
looking at /proc/interrupts.
