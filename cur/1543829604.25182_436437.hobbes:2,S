	Hmm. We may need to be careful with terminology here. Keep in mind that
a task is not the same as the userspace concept of a  "process".
	When a task is executing a module's code it will be safe to traverse
the task's notifier chain to find state. It will *not* be safe to
traverse the notifier chain of other tasks -- even if the other task is
a thread in the same "process".
