Subject: 2.6.11-rc2-mm1: DVB compile error
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

The following compile error comes from Linus' tree:
<--  snip  -->
...
  LD      .tmp_vmlinux1
drivers/built-in.o(.bss+0xd50e4): multiple definition of `debug'
arch/i386/kernel/built-in.o(.text+0x2e4c): first defined here
make: *** [.tmp_vmlinux1] Error 1
<--  snip  -->
The offender is in drivers/media/dvb/dibusb/dvb-dibusb-core.c:
"debug" is not a good name for a global variable...
