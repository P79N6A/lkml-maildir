As an aside, some of the stuff in Documentation/ like Rusty's various
guides are now woefully out of date with whats happening in 2.5
Yet another small project for someone with too much time on their
hands would be to go through this, deleting the obsolete stuff, and
updating the locking documentation to reflect new issues like
preemption.
