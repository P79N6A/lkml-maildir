FWIW, GDB also would like to have #3.  We can do without it; GDB
already supports calling functions in the inferior by a stack or code
trampoline, so we could just make the child call mprotect; but it would
be faster and simpler to have a ptrace op for it.  HP/UX had, among
other things, TT_PROC_SET_MPROTECT and TT_PROC_GET_MPROTECT; I don't
think we have a system call equivalent to GET_MPROTECT right now.
Of course, without more comprehensive kernel support doing
protection-based watchpoints this way is murder for perfomance, almost
as bad as just doing it by single-stepping.  You need to disable them
at every syscall entry, which means that you can't have multiple
threads running in userspace while one thread is in a syscall, or you
might miss a watchpoint event.
It would be ideal to have some way to set the permissions such that
accesses from inside the kernel succeeded and from userspace failed
(i.e. render it temporarily a kernel page; but not exactly; we'd want
things like "normally writeable; currently writeable by the kernel;
still currently readable by userspace" for a normal watchpoint).
I don't know if that's practical without impacting MM performance. 
Suggestions welcome; I haven't really started to work on this yet
although it's creeping up my list of important debugger projects. 
PowerPC MMUs have a mechanism that could be used for this but I don't
know if other architectures do.
