is the only reason that device_shutdown() is not appropriate the amount of 
time it takes to shutdown some devices and then start them up again? (I'm 
specificly thinking of drive spin down/up as an example)
if so, it is probably worth implementing a demo with the long times 
involved to hash out any other problems, and then implemnt shortcuts to 
avoid the device_shutdown only where the time involved is excessive.
so, exactly where in the process above does the memory map need to be 
created? is this in the machine_shutdown step or would it need to be in 
the machine_kexec step?
