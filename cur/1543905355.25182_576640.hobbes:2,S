This is a gdb issue. I had raised it in gdb mailing list some time back.

What version of gdb you are using? I know it got fixed for gdb shipped
with RHEL5. I am not sure about what upstream version of gdb it got fixed
in.
I think Jan Kratochvil had put a patch to fix the issue. I am copying him
on the mail and he should be able to tell which version of gdb to use.
Thanks
