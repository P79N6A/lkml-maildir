Hello Thomas,
You might have a look at the Soekris vpn1401 card, (technical specs
here: 
http://www.soekris.com/vpn1401.htm
). It is available in the EU
and can do AES256 without a problem.
It does have linux support, though I'm not sure if it can be used by
OpenSSL applications. Typically, you'd have to have the crypto
accelerator take over API calls to en/decrypt for OpenSSL (A crypto
accelerator is basically an FPGA with the required algos coded in), so
I'm not too sure if it is possible to do this without actually editing
OpenSSL's code directly
