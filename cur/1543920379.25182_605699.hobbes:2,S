Chuck, Balbir,
we still have a problem with stime occosionally going backwards. I stated
below that I think this is not fixable with the current utime/stime split
algorithm.
Balbir, you wrote this code, Chuck you tried to fix it. Any ideas how to
fix this properly? The only idea I have requires that we save the old value
of utime and stime and therefore requires additional locking.
Otherwise I suggest to apply my reversion patch from below:

--------- patch-----------
Fix stime going backwards
after 2.6.22 the accounting was changes to use sched_clock and to use stime 
and utime only for the split. This is where task_utime and task_stime were 
introduced. See the code in 2.6.23-rc1.
Unfortunately this broke the accouting on s390 which already has precise 
numbers in utime and stime. So the code was partially reverted to use stime 
and utime again where appropriate, which are of type  cputime_t. 
It now seems, that the rest of the logic is still broken.
This patch basically reverts the rest of b27f03d4bdc145a09fb7b0c0e004b29f1ee555fa
and  should restore the 2.6.22 behavior. The process time is used from tasks
utime  and stime instead of the scheduler clock. That means, in general after
a long period of time, it is less accurate than the sum_exec_runtime based 
code, but it doesnt break top.
