Subject: [RFC] [PATCH] lazy TLB: possible bug, some notes (2.3.12)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/1999/7/30/66

1) I've attached a small patch which should fix 2 possible
problems on the i386.
* mm->cpu_vm_mask was not set on crossing TLB flushes.
* there was a race in flush_tlb_current_task() between setting
mm->cpu_vm_mask and the IPI which could modify cpu_vm_mask.
Since flush_tlb_current_task() is now identical to 
flush_tlb_mm(current->mm), I'd remove flush_tlb_current_task()
and change the macro for flush_tlb(). [in include/asm/pgtable.h]
2) I think it should be possible to call start_lazy_tlb()
even if the thread is already in the lazy-tlb mode.
i.e. multiple calls to start_lazy_tlb() should be possible
as long as you call end_lazy_tlb() for every start_lazy_tlb()
call.
Curently, this would oops.
3) I noticed that 2.3.12 breaks the PPC mm implementation:
mmu_context_overflow() assumes that it can get to all
mm's by looking at tsk->mm for all tasks in the system.
(arch/ppc/mm/init.c)
This is not correct any more: if a user thread executes
sys_bdflush(), then this mm will not be referenced
from tsk->mm.
[I don't have a PPC, but it looks wrong]
