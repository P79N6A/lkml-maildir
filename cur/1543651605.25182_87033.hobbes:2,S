Geoff,
The LTP would be happy to have anyone in the Linux community donate test
cases.  This includes any POSIX tests.
The LTP would not be advertised as a POSIX compliance test, that would be
up to LSB to handle.  These tests
would only increase the overall LTP api coverages.
Does your group own these tests?  Do you want to donate them to the LTP?

My understanding is that LTP is focused on current mainline kernel testing,
while this project's initial concern is areas that are not currently in
Linux
like POSIX message queues, semaphores, and full support for POSIX threads.
I see
this as being used to evaluate different implementations that are being
considered for inclusion in the kernel, glibc, etc.
This project is concerned with the POSIX APIs regardless of where they are
implemented (kernel, glibc, etc.). Thus it can focus on POSIX, independent
of
implementation. This project will be more concerned with traceability back
to
the POSIX specification, and completeness of coverage, than I would expect
from
LTP.
That said, there is some overlap, and an exchange of test cases between the
projects may be very useful.
I've copied Stephanie from LTP to get her reaction.
