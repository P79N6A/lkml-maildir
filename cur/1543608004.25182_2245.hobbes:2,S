That's what I don't want to do, at least at every schedule().
The main purpose of the proposed scheduler is to relax process movement
policies.

Real time processes, when wakeup up fall calling reschedule_idle() that
will either find the CPU idle or will be reschedule due a favorable
preemption_goodness().
One of balancing scheme I'm using tries to distribute RT tasks evenly on
CPUs.

I'm currently trying an hysteresis approach with a tunable value of
hysteresis to watch at the different performance/behavior.
