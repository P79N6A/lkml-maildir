Owww crap.  The majority of web traffic is _from_ the
server _to_ the client. Same for ftp, realaudio, etc...
In fact, usually the server is the _remote_ machine and
the client is the _local_ machine. Anybody who believes
in having the client remote and the server local should
be shipped off to whereever the server is ;)
