If you think we haven't done that, think again.  We're at the wrong end
of the pipe to do that, I'm pretty sure that what you are describing 
simply won't work.  We've already tried rate limiting all traffic except
for the phone traffic to 1/2 the T1 line and it doesn't work.
Remember, we're talking vioce here.  Retransmits don't work and aren't
even attempted.  I've got people in 5 or 6 states spread out from one 
end of the USA to the other.  So any disruption means things don't work.
All of the traffic shaping tends to be focussed on "good" versus "bad"
bandwidth utilization.  That's nice but it means that you are tolerant
of a "settling time" during which everyone is fighting for bandwidth.
