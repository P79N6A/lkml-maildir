Good - but not enough :)
[asuardi@dolphin linux]$ make xconfig
rm -f include/asm
( cd include ; ln -sf asm-i386 asm)
/usr/src/linux/include
make -C scripts kconfig.tk
make[1]: Entering directory `/usr/src/linux-2.5.5-pre1/scripts'
cat header.tk >> ./kconfig.tk
./tkparse < ../arch/i386/config.in >> kconfig.tk
sound/isa/Config.in: 23: can't handle dep_bool/dep_mbool/dep_tristate condition
make[1]: *** [kconfig.tk] Error 1
make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/linux-2.5.5-pre1/scripts'
make: *** [xconfig] Error 2
It looks like adding $CONFIG_SND on line 23 in sound/isa/Config.in
  makes xconfig start up...
Thanks,
