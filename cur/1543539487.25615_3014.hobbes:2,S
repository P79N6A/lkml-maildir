None of this stuff should be more than milliseconds. But milliseconds are
an eternity for some applications. Building it with simple locking is
probably a good idea.

There isn't any Linux on NUMA yet, and if there was, it would probably be
at SGI. But it's something we've started thinking about and some of the
infrastructure is already in place, eg the zone allocator.
