Oh, people have done L1/L2 TLB splits for a long time. The two-level TLB
exists in Athlon (and I think nexgen did it in the x86 space almost 10
years ago, and that's probably what got AMD into that game). Others have 
done it too.
And people have done split TLB's (I/D split is quite common, duplicated by
memory unit is getting so).
But multiple entries loaded at a time?
