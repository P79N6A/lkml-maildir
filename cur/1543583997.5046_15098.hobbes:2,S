This is my first report of a kernel crash, so if there is more information 
wanted, please let me know and I'll do my best to supply it.
I'm running Mandrake 7.2 with a 2.2.18 kernel and GNOME, PIII 500 mhz, 
256MB ram, AIC789x SCSI on mobo, Fujitsu 18GB scsi HD, ATI video card.
This evening, xscreensaver crashed with a message saying (roughly):
	"xscreensaver hypercube had(?) a SIGSEGV"
I had to power down the machine and restart it.  From /var/log/messages the 
last message before the reboot and the first message after the reboot are:
Mar  6 16:35:32 osage kernel: VM: do_try_to_free_pages failed for kswapd...
Mar  6 17:13:04 osage syslogd 1.4-0: restart.
2.2.18 has run for as long as 71 days on this machine (at which point I 
restarted it to include the Sangoma WANROUTER driver, which was NOT running 
at the time of the crash).
I'll be glad to supply any additional info/files.  Just let me know what's 
wanted.
David
