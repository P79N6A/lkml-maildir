I'm writing a linux network driver for an NIC. I'm using Rubini's book
Linux device drivers, and was trying to run the example code snull.c
(which is written for v2.1)
I have linux version 2.2.5-22. My problem is this. While using route add,
i get the following message.
route add -net snullnet0 sn1
SIOCADDRT: Invalid argument
Can anyone tell what is going wrong? how do i debug the
problem?, I'm new to linux drivers, & any help would be
appreciated. I tried going throug route.c, without much success.
Thanks,
Anand.
