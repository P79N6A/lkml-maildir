This is now upstream, and so I see a bunch of warnings for every ia64
build.  Some of them are real, I need to add some syscalls, but there
are a few bogus ones because ia64 chose different names (e.g. we have
a sys_clone() that glibc uses to implement fork() and vfork()).
Just checking that the right way for me to shut checksyscalls.sh up is
to add:
#define __IGNORE_fork
#define __IGNORE_vfork
etc. to include/asm-ia64/unistd.h for each of the bogus ones.  Or is there
some other preferred mechanism?
