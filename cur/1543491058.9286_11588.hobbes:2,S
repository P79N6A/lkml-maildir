No, it's not for 3DNow! :) See /usr/src/linux/Documentation/mtrr.txt. I use
it at work (Pentium II) but I dont know how well it works with K6es, at home
(AMD K6-2) it Oopses. (Alan has it, right, Alan ?)

There is some optimization, i think, but it's mostly for instruction
alignment which is the same as for normal pentiums (correct me if i'm wrong,
anyone.) As for 3DNow! support or optimization, it's not much of a kernel
issue, i believe, because of the nature of the new opcodes.
