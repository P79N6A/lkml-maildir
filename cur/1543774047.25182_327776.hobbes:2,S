It's been awhile since last time I reported Linux kernel performance
for an industry standard transaction processing database benchmark. It's
time to report the data again to keep everyone informed.  Here is the
latest result that we measured (4P 1.6GHz ia64, 9M L3 cache, 64GB memory,
480 15K-RPM disks).
2.4.21-4.EL	baseline
2.6.9		- 6.00%
2.6.11	-13.00%
2.6.12-rc3	-13.54%
2.6.12-rc4	-13.05%
2.6.12-rc5	-12.86%
2.6.12-rc6	-12.66%
It's been hovering around -13%.  I will take a measurement of 2.6.12, though
I don't expect it to deviate too far from 2.6.12-rc6.  There are 718 patches
committed since 2.6.12 as of 6/22 14:09 PDT, so I'm going to take a snapshot
today or tomorrow and queue it up for benchmark measurement.  I will probably
take all the scheduler patches currently in -mm and give that a whirl as well.
