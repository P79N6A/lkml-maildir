We've got a strange one. We're seeing system crashes where memory, including 
kernel text (executable) pages, is being corrupted. If you have any idea what 
might be causing this, or if you've seen this yourself, or if you have ideas 
on how to debug it, please let us know.
The corrupting data consist of 16  individual bytes, each at an 8-byte offset, 
8 byte aligned. (see data below for an example)
Here's the data...  The first column marks the offset within the page, the 2nd 
column is the corrupted data, the 3rd column is the expected/correct data
Note, that the 0->0 is likely also corruption, but happenned to overwrite a zero 
with a zero

FYI. 
Hardware is ~1GHz PIII, 512MB, UP, eepro100 nic, ide drives
Software linux2.4.8,no modules, eepro100,  only 512MB of swap, serial ports 
	are HEAVILY used.
