When the reader falls behind, keep supplying differential
updates as long as practical. When this starts to eat up
lots of memory, switch to supplying the full list until
the reader catches up again.

If you won't scan, why update the display? This boils down
to simply setting a lower refresh rate or using "nice".

This is crummy. It's done for wchan, since that is so horribly
expensive, but I'm not liking the larger race condition window.
Remember that PIDs get reused. There isn't a generation counter
or UUID that can be checked.

While "pid" makes a nice extreme example, note that ps must
handle arbitrary cases like "pmem,comm,wchan,ppid,session".
Now, I direct your attention to "Introduction to Algorithms",
by Cormen, Leiserson, and Rivest. Find the section entitled
"The set-covering problem". It's page 974, section 37.3, in
my version of the book. An example of this would be the
determination of the minimum set of /proc files needed to
supply some required set of process attributes.
Look familiar? It's NP-hard. To me, that just sounds bad. :-)
While there are decent (?) approximations that run in
polynomial time, they are generally overkill. It is very
common to need both the stat and status files. Selection,
sorting, and display all may require data.
But hey, we can go ahead and compute NP-hard problems in
userspace if that makes the kernel less complicated. :-)
Just remember that if I say "this is hard", I mean it.
