These happen frequently to me (when compiling and installing a
new glibc)
But in this case you would have other messages (IIRC something
like
respawn too fast).
Thus the problem is not this!
Possible problem:
1) permition of /sbin/init
2) unable to exec ELF binary (or a.out, which init do you
have?)
3) problems with the root partition. (check it with an
emergency disk)
4) once I had strange problem with init and /dev (init was
continuosly
killed, but after some init.d scripts). Check your /dev/
