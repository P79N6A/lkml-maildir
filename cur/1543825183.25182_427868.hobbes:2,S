Nothing from ALSA side.  Maybe the module loading mechanism (or slot
order) was changed on your system.
The scenario is:
intel8x0 driver is first loaded on the first empty slot (index=0)
before snd-emu10k1.  Since you set index=0 module option for
snd-emu10k1, it tried to load on the same slot but failed.
A workaround is to set index=1 option for snd-intel8x0 in addition,
for using emu10k1 as the primary card.
