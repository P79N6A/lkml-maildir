Hello Andrea,
forget about the scheduler changes. I did the following change and the
problem is almost solved. Before I had both kernel and wav files on
/dev/hda6              4200828   1745204   2455624  42% /usr
/dev/hda6 on /usr type reiserfs (rw)
I copied kernel source and wav files to
/dev/hda8              8989695   2907606   5615804  34% /mnt
/dev/hda8 on /mnt type ext2 (rw)
and it skipped only three (very short) times. So it seems to be a problem
of reiserfs in combination with your memory management changes. Dang!
Can someone of the reiserfs people comment on this?
Regards,
   Jogi
