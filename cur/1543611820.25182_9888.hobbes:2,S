Really? Do you run hdparm setuid root or allow read access of hde? In any
case, allowing easy access from user space via hdparm trickes me as a
major security issue. The geometry is in /proc/ide/hd?/geometry, but the
other info is not readily available to other than root user in most
systems. I think his intention was to make it more generally available. I
don't see any reason to require root to see this information, and I think
reducing the need for root is a good thing for security.
It would be highly desirable to define new proc data as subject to
addition of more information per line at any time, and as long as the
fields are added at the end of the line a parser can easily be written not
to break. As you note, changing existing information presents other
problems and will break things, since /proc/partitions was not defines as
extensible.
I personally would have no problem adding this to 2.5, lots of things will
change, but I agree that a change to 2.4 is not practical as a retrofit.
