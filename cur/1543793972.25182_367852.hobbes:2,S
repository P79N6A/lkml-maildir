nr_hw_segments is how many segments your driver will see once dma
mapping is complete (and the IOMMU has done its tricks), so you want to
set that to 1 if the hardware can't handle an sg list.
That'll work irregardless of whether there's an IOMMU there or not. Note
that the mere existence of an IOMMU will _not_ save your performance on
this hardware, you need one with good virtual merging support to get
larger transfers.
