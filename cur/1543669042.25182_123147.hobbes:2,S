Please see:

You probably have to mount usbfs yourself, as some distro's startup
scripts seem to not like 2.5 and don't do it for you.

Make the directory:
	mkdir /sys
and then mount sysfs there:
	mount -t sysfs none /sys
Edit your /etc/fstab to add it so that it is always mounted at startup.

right?  What does lsmod show?
