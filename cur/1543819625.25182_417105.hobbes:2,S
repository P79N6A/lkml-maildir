To be able to execute any child, the confined process must have explicit
permission to execute it:
    * "/bin/foo px" says that the child will execute with its own
      policy. The policy must exist, or access is denied. This is useful
      if, say, xinetd wants to exec Sendmail.
    * "/bin/foo ix" says that the child will execute with its parent's
      policy, "inherit". This is useful if, say, a shell script wants to
      exec cp.
    * "/bin/foo ux" says that the child will exec with no confinement at
      all. This should be used carefully, say, if sshd wants to exec
      bash to allow an administrator to have an unconfined shell.
You can also say something like "/bin/** ix" which would let you run
anything in /bin, but all subject to the parent's policy. You could say
"/bin/** px" but that would mostly cause exec() failures except to the
extent that policies exist. You could say "/bin/** ux" but that would
not be wise :)
