Hi Alan!

Yes, but a new video-card or Motherboard can be easily bought (although it 
costs), but the data on a locked disk is lost forever, unless you pay for 
professional recovery (which is also a time-issue, if time critical data is 
stored on the disk). Of course, this can be solved with a good backup 
strategy...
I agree with you though, that this really isn't a kernel issue, but a BIOS 
thing. Distributors should/could provide additional security by freezing the 
security-features early during boot, until BIOS vendors do their homework.
regards,
Jonas
