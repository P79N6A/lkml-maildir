Besides, when the disk goes offline, which is what happened to me before 
due to the bad setting of the AAC_MAX_32BIT_SGBCOUNT constant in 
aacraid.h, kernel adequately responses with messages saying something like 
this:
[  278.705813] scsi0 (0:0): rejecting I/O to offline device
[  278.708685] Buffer I/O error on device sda2, logical block 1
[  278.711589] lost page write due to I/O error on sda2
As you may see in my first report of the event when I've witnessed the 
real situation of the array going offline, see the whole report here:

However this time, it was different. I am a 100% positive that no such 
messages appeared whatsoever. Only these:
      sd 0:0:0:0: SCSI error: return code = 0x8000002
      sda: Current: sense key: Hardware Error
          Additional sense: Internal target failure
      Info fld=0x0
      end_request: I/O error, dev sda, sector <some sector number>
Nothing else.
