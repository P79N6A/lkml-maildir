Hi.
I don't know if its currently considered important, but just for the 
record.
Please CC any replies to me, since I am not subscribed to the list.
I'm running an AMD Duron/Via kt133, with Debian testing.  Nothing 
unusual that
I am aware of.  If I choose to use the ATI Rage128 framebuffer console, 
I get
the following compile error:
gcc -Wp,-MD,drivers/video/.aty128fb.o.d -D__KERNEL__ -Iinclude -Wall 
-Wstrict-prototypes -Wno-trigraphs -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer
