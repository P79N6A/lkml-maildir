Subject: repetitive reinitialization of active_list and inactive_list in free_area_init_core()

inactive_list and active_list are global, yet they are repeatedly
initialized using INIT_LIST_HEAD() in free_area_init_core(). This
patch is originally due to Christoph Hellwig, and by some reports
has been implementated before in 2.4-based trees by Andrea Arcangeli.
Against 2.5.19.
