Oh damn.  I bisected this three times and the second two times both landed on
this:
commit 33f807ba0d9259e7c75c7a2ce8bd2787e5b540c7
Author: Stephen Hemminger <shemminger@linux-foundation.org>

and I stupidly assumed that it couldn't be this commit because it was a
no-op.  I didn't think to look for an _impicit_ test of NETPOLL_RX_DROP
such as the one above.  That's pretty poor style IMO :(
That bisecting took me several hours and at the time I hoped that it would
receive a more-than-zero response.  btw.
