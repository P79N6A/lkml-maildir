Note that the "transparent" really means that it forwards all IO resources 
even outside the windows, and the windows are really just for show.
The kernel even used to totally ignore them, now it uses them as a hint 
and will _preferably_ put stuff inside the window for such bridges, if the 
windows have been set up (not all systems will even set up the windows at 
all).

It really shouldn't even matter where it ends up being enabled. Trying to 
move it into the bridge window is as good as anything else, since it was 
disabled to begin with (which means that you can't necessarily trust the 
location that it was disabled _at_ - the ffff0000 value could even be just 
what the firmware left it at after doing PCI BAR sizing, although I 
suspect that it's a perfectly valid address).
