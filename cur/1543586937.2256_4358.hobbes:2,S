There is no patch for 2.4.3-ac3. You could say, well if you want 6.1.10,
use plain 2.4.3.
That is not the way to do things. It is supposed that what people can get
at your site is the aic driver. If the patch contains something different,
from the tarball, nobody knows.
If there is a bug in kernel, please mail it to lkml.
And in your site make VERY clear and independent the patch to correct
that thing in main SCSI subsystem from the patch to upgrade your drivers.
