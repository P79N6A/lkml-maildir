Yah, that, and i intend to take over this driver, and this is really
only platform specific munging in the driver itself, I pretty much don't
change anything to the way the driver interfaces to Alsa.
Once I am done rewriting it completely (which I started doing but it
will take some time to complete) to get digital, AC3, etc... I will
submit the new one to alsa-devel though for comments.
Ben.
