We have had this problem a lot overhere, it is indeed an incorrect speed
or full/half duplex mode.
It perticularly happened in combination with Cisco Catalist switches, we
solved it by compiling the driver into the kernel in stead of using a
modular version, in combination with telling the Cisco's expicitely to use
100 Mbit full duplex and adding spanning-tree portfast to the port config.
