I sent you a patch exactly like this a few days ago, but I don't know
if you got it. This way is a lot more simple than the approach you went
for in your last patch, but it really shouldn't matter at all. All it
does is to clear a warning. One tip though, in SubmittingPatches you
can read that the best way to create patches is by making them apply
with the -p1 flag. This is done by including the actual kernel source
directory when making the diff, such as this:
diff -up linux/fs/xfs/xfs_log_recover.c.orig linux/fs/xfs/xfs_log_recover.c
It doesn't matter what you named your kernel directory, since the -p1 flag
ignores that name. Using this command will improve your chances of getting
your patches included.
