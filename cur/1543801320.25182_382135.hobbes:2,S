Now that you mention it I remember that thread[1].
How about returning -ENXIO (or similar) then?
I went through all the users of platform_get_irq*() and some of them
assume < 0 is an error, some of them think 0 is an error, some of them
think 0 means there's no IRQ available, some of them use NO_IRQ, and
some don't even check and just pass the result to request_irq().
