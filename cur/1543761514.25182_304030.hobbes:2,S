In summary, we agreed that the API you propose should be: 
int (*error_handler)(struct pci_dev *dev, union error_src *);
I believe this API works for most of PCI Express needs.  The only
addition PCI Express needs is a mechanism for the AER code to request a
port bus driver to perform a downstream link reset when an error occurs
on that downstream link. For example, you can add the
PCIERR_ERROR_PORT_RESET message with the return is either
PCIERR_RESULT_RECOVERED or PCIERR_RESULT_DISCONNECT to fit PCI Express
needs.
Thanks,
Long
