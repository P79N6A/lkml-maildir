Yep. Currently, we use part of "key" as the dentry name. For example,
# ipcs
------ Shared Memory Segments --------
key        shmid      owner      perms      bytes      nattch     status
0x083d0d74 851968     db2inst1  767        33554432   13
# grep 83d0d74 /proc/*/maps
/proc/11110/maps:40004724000-40006724000 rw-s 00000000 00:08 851968  /SYSV083d0d74 (deleted)
/proc/11111/maps:40004724000-40006724000 rw-s 00000000 00:08 851968  /SYSV083d0d74 (deleted)
/proc/11112/maps:40004724000-40006724000 rw-s 00000000 00:08 851968  /SYSV083d0d74 (deleted)
/proc/11113/maps:40004724000-40006724000 rw-s 00000000 00:08 851968  /SYSV083d0d74 (deleted)
..
The issue is with the ones with key = 0x0000000, like following:
# ipcs
------ Shared Memory Segments --------
key        shmid      owner      perms      bytes      nattch     status
0x00000000 884737     db2inst1  767        33554432   13
0x00000000 950275     db2fenc1  701        23052288   13
There is no unique way to identify them easily :(
I guess, like you suggested, we can change the dentry name to use shmid
instead of the portions of the "key" to make it unique. I think, I can 
work out a patch for this.

Thanks for your suggestion.
Thanks,
