Hi, 
I've tried to create a disk (DVD) which contains a single 3.8GB file. The 
creation (mkisofs) worked and the disk's TOC reads 3.8GB. However, the 
filesystem reads as if one ~9MB file only exists. 
I guess large files in isofs may be out of spec. 
Q: What's the file size limit in iso9660?
Q: Is there any chance the negative number (although out of spec) may be 
correctly interpreted (mount option) ?
Thanks.
