Normal behaviour.  The disk in question is a dynamic disk as created by
Windows 2k/xp or later.  You need to compile in windows dynamic disk (LDM)
support into your kernel and then your disk's partitions will be
recognised properly.  Note AFAIK there are no tools in existence for Linux
that will allow you to modify the dynamic disk partition layout.
Best regards,
