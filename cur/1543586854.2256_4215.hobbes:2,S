Why do it from user space?  Simply add a printk() to sys_init_module() or
similar.  Granted, this will only help until the lusers install a patched
sysklog before installing a backdoor module, but so would the user-space
solution.  At least the kernel message will stay in kernel memory until
it is flushed out with more messages (which itself might be detectable).
Cheers, Andreas
