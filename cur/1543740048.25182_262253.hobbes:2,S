can we do something to at least try to avoid other (new) architectures
picking up these syscalls even when we can't fix the existing ones?
Or can we do like a once-per-boot printk to mark then deprecated now so
that eventually we can remove them, and that application writers realize
they are deprecated and wont use them for new code ?
