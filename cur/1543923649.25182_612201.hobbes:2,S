Well, I tested it on x86 and AMD64 only. For slub:
Using cmpxchg_local shows a performance improvements of the fast path
goes from a 66% speedup on a Pentium 4 to a 14% speedup on AMD64.
It really depends on how fast cmpxchg_local is vs disabling interrupts.

As Christoph pointed out, we even saw a small slowdown on ia64 because
there is no concept of atomicity wrt only one CPU. Emulating this with
irq disable has been tried, but just the supplementary memory barriers
hurts performance a bit. We tried to come up with clever macros that
switch between irq disable and cmpxchg_local depending on the
architecture, but all the results were awkward.
I guess it's time for me to repost my patchset. I use interrupt disable
to emulate the cmpxchg_local on architectures that lacks atomic ops.
