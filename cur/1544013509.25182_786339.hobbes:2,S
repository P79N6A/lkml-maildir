I agree, it isn't a great situation. Nonetheless, it has always been
thus for ext3, and so far we've muddled along. Unless and until we can
replay the journal in-memory without touching the on-disk data, we are
stuck with it.
We can't refuse to mount an unclean FS, as that would break booting.
We also can't ignore the journal by default, if/when we get a patch to
do so at all, as that effectively corrupts random chunks of the FS.
Fine for forensics and recovery; not so much for booting from.
