Why no to have a khttpd "fully compatible" with Apache Core modules?
By this way, the fallback to Apache for dynamic contents will be
strightforward and still we can have SSI functionality implemented in
kernel server module. 
Indeed, sysadmins and webmaster can decide to use  Apache core into
the kernel or userland, without touching a line in config files (having a
"standard" /etc/httpd/httpd.conf conf file).
The communication among the khttpd and userland apache servers can be done
as usual in Apache 1.3.x, through shared memory.
