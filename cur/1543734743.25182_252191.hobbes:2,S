FWIW the libata test for checking whether it is OK to issue a flush is
         return ata_id_wcache_enabled(dev) ||
                ata_id_has_flush(dev) ||
                ata_id_has_flush_ext(dev);
and if it passes that test,
         if ((tf->flags & ATA_TFLAG_LBA48) &&
             (ata_id_has_flush_ext(qc->dev)))
                 tf->command = ATA_CMD_FLUSH_EXT;
         else
                 tf->command = ATA_CMD_FLUSH;
I wouldn't object to removing the "ata_id_wcache_enabled" test if people 
feel that it is unsafe.
