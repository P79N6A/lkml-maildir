The benchmarks/stress tests take longer to run than I have time left to
use the system where nobh really matters, and the driver breakage from
the recent SCSI changes (qlogic 2300, vendor code) isn't getting fixed
anytime in the next 8 hours anyway, esp. since I have zero SCSI knowledge.
So I'm stuck until next weekend, though I guess I can check to see if it
oopses etc. on smaller systems.
