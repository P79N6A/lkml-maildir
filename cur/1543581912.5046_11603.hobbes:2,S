Having people look things up in the spec isn't very user friendly.
Finding a copy of the PCI 2.1 or 2.2 spec I could pass on to others
(outside of HP) was a problem last year. The best I could do then
(legally) was point them to "PCI Systems Architecture" published
by MindShare.

Generic PCI code can d very little by itself with MSI since not all
platforms provide support for it - even within the same arch.
Support for MSI is very platform specific.
Eg for parisc: I expect everything but V-class to support MSI.
There are some subtle differences between transaction based
interrupts used by parisc CPU and MSI. But I don't recall what
they are at the moment - I'd have to look it up again.
I thought any x86 with SAPIC (not sure about APIC) could support
MSI as well. But I don't know the x86 arch nearly as well.
It's also possible for the driver to just ignore MSI and not use it.
ie use regular PCI IRQ lines for interrupts.
