Subject: [patch 0/9] mutex subsystem, -V4
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

this is the -V4 of the mutex subsystem patch-queue. It consists of the 
following patches:
  add-atomic-xchg.patch
  add-atomic-call-func-i386.patch
  add-atomic-call-func-x86_64.patch
  add-atomic-call-wrappers-rest.patch
  mutex-core.patch
  mutex-switch-arm-to-xchg.patch
  mutex-debug.patch
  mutex-debug-more.patch
  xfs-mutex-namespace-collision-fix.patch
the patches are against Linus' latest GIT tree, and they should work 
fine on every Linux architecture.
Changes since -V3:
- imlemented an atomic_xchg() based mutex implementation. It integrated
  pretty nicely into the generic code, and most of the code is still
  shared.
- added __ARCH_WANT_XCHG_BASED_ATOMICS: if an architecture defines 
  this then the generic mutex code will switch to the atomic_xchg() 
  implementation.
  This should be conceptually equivalent to the variant Nicolas Pitre 
  posted - Nicolas, could you check out this one? It's much easier to 
  provide this in the generic implementation, and the code ends up 
  looking cleaner.
- eliminated ARCH_IMPLEMENTS_MUTEX_FASTPATH: there's no need for 
  architectures to override the generic code anymore, with the 
  introduction of __ARCH_WANT_XCHG_BASED_ATOMICS.
- ARM: enable __ARCH_WANT_XCHG_BASED_ATOMICS.
- ARM buildfix: move the new atomic primitives to the correct place.
  (Nicolas Pitre)
- optimization: unlock the mutex outside of the spinlock (suggested by 
  Nicolas Pitre)
- removed leftover arch_semaphore reference from the XFS patch. (noticed
  by Arjan van de Ven)
- better document the fact that mutex_trylock() follows spin_trylock() 
  semantics, not sem_trylock() semantics.
- cleanup: got rid of the MUTEX_LOCKLESS_FASTPATH define. (in -V3 this
  became equivalent to DEBUG_MUTEXES, via the elimination of the
  __HAVE_ARCH_CMPXCHG dependency on the fastpath.)
- further simplified and unified mutex_trylock().
- DocBook entries, and more documentation of internals.
- dropped the spinlock-debug fix, Linus merged it.
