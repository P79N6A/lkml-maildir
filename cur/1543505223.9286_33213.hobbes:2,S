Hi Terry.
I see from your second message that you accidentally posted this to
the wrong mailing list, but it hasn't appeared in linux-hams yet, so
I've responded to the one that has appeared and forwarded my reply to
both lists. Future comments only expected in linux-hams though...

I have both available on different systems on my network, so will
check this out for you.

My systems are all RedHat, a mixture of 5.2 and 6.0 raw installs, so
I'll have a play with it on them and report.

I've set up a mirror for you, so you can add the following:
	
ftp://ftp.memalpha.cx/mirrors/HamRadio/Linux/dgipip/
Despite the Christmas Island domain, that's half the way round the
world from you...

Fairy Nuff.

That's the important detail.
Best wishes from Riley.
