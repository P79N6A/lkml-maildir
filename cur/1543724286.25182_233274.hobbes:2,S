Even when this isn't the case you don't want to make all rt_task() 
checks "unlikely".  In particular, during "wake up" using "unlikely" 
around rt_task() will increase the time that it takes for SCHED_FIFO 
tasks to get onto the CPU when they wake which will be bad for latency 
(which is generally important to these tasks as evidenced by several 
threads on the topic).
