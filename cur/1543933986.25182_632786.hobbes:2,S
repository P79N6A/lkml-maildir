actually, people have, and i have too. But i agree that io_delay=none 
would be stupid now, and would probably be stupid in v2.6.26 too.
i also have a debug patch that counts the number of _p() API uses and 
prints a stacktrace (once per bootup) if it occurs [wrote it 2 weeks 
ago] - so i agree with you that we can do this more gradually and more 
intelligently. As long as it does not turn into a BKL situation. It's 
2008 in a day and we've still got the NFS client code running under the 
BKL - quite ridiculous IMO.
