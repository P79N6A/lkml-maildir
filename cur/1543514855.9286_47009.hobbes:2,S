Dont' forget that the virtual address you get from ioremap() is not a
real pointer in the sense that you are allowed to  directly reference
the memory it points at.

By following Linux kernel.

I/O space as in I/O ports registers or as in PCI shared memory?

The problem here is that some PCI implementations will not provide a
direct linear mapping of the PCI shared memory space, like on some
Alphas which come with sparse memory.

Correct, maybe I wasn't clear enough on this one.

I thought it was already documented, but I guess you are
right. Documentation/pci.txt still refers to the old and deprecated
pcibios_foo() functions and Documentation/IO-mapping.txt doesn't
mention sparse memory directly, though it does state that one should
use readl/writel.
