Hi
        I have problems with the swap code in 2.2.15pre9 (newer pre's
        are worst). I have obtained the following errors:
swap_duplicate: entry 0816e000, offset exceeds max
VM: killing process hsc
swap_free: offset exceeds max
swap_free: offset exceeds max
swap_free: offset exceeds max
swap_free: offset exceeds max
swap_free: offset exceeds max
swap_free: offset exceeds max
swap_free: offset exceeds max
swap_free: offset exceeds max
And the swap is not full, it is almost empty when I receive this
message:
vexeta:/usr/src# free
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:        258060     254868       3192      32724      93084      86448
-/+ buffers/cache:      75336     182724
Swap:       248996       7148     241848
The problem happens when I am mapping a file in one process (around
400MB) with a lot of small mmaps. It kills other processes, not the
one which is using all the memory.  I can give you more information on
request (Basically is an implementation of virtual memory in user-space).
Configuration:
Athlon 500Mhz
IDE
256MB RAM
more information on request. If you need to test something or I can do
something to help let me know.
TIA, Juan.
