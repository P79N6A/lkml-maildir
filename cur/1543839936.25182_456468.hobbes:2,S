The problem is that finding the window isn't really a direct function of
free space, it's a function of fragmentation. You could have a 50% full
file system that still can't find a 32 block window by having every
other block used. I know it's an extremely unlikely case, but it
demonstrates the point perfectly.

If the space after the end of the file has 32 or more blocks free, even
without the bigalloc behavior, those blocks will be used.
Also, I think the bigalloc behavior just ultimately ends up introducing
even more fragmentation on an already fragmented file system. It'll keep
contiguous chunks together, but those chunks can end up being spread all
over the disk.
