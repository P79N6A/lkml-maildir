And then you'll have people wonder why the server which sent out all
those files has no log entries. You'd have to selectively unfreeze user
space, which is a cure worse than the desease.
Simply throwing away user space work is a bug. And no, you cannot say that
it'll be redone away, as you are throwing away accepted input, too.
