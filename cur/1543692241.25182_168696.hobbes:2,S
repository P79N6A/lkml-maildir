I Have the same problem too but with 2.4.23-pre4
System, reach to hang up about 2 or 3 seconds and puts sound server down.
I doubt that is or not kernel issue, because sometimes it never happens.
With my old kernel 2.4.21-pre5 works fine.
This is not related to sound server (arts) because is a time issue on
arts (you can reproduce it putting back your system clock), but kernel
doesn't said anything at respect.
I trying to find out which driver or process is guilty.
