The window you see exists, but it is there by design.
tid_fd_revalidate is designed to be called any time after prod_fd_instantiate()
runs.  So it requires all of the locks it needs.  It's purpose in life
is to verify the permissions.
We have earlier increased the reference count of everything when we grabbed
the dentry.
The final tid_fd_revalidate in proc_fd_instantiate was added recently
to ensure we have a consistent set of checks before returning a dentry
to a user. 
So I think you have a legitimate problem but it isn't because we drop
and reaquire the locks.
There was a little recent work making some of the fdtable access
no-rcu.   See commit ca99c1da080345e227cfb083c330a184d42e27f3.  But
I don't think that applies here.
You certain seem to be in one of the proc stress conditions so this
may not be a unique bug.
Digging through the disassembly and figuring out which access you died
on would be interesting, so we could know with precision which part
of tid_fd_revalidate we are dying in.  My ppc64 isn't good enough 
especially without the matching binaries to figure that out though.
All I know is that you are about 25 instructions into
tid_fd_revalidate.
I don't have a clue where to start to dig into this.
