Hmm.  I thought the original idea for the "flash LEDs on panic" was
so you knew something had gone wrong early in the boot, at the kind
of places where you don't have a console initialised.  If you don't
have the console initialised, you sure as hell don't have the input
layer or keyboard drivers initialised.
Otherwise it becomes a "toy" feature that doesn't have much value.
What would be more useful would be to disable the console blank
timer on a panic() so it doesn't blank half-way through someone
reading the oops, leaving them with no way to read the rest of it!
