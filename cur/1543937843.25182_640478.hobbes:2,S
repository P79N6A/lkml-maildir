I took Toralf's original config and did a build of latest mainline kernel.
I got two section mismatch warnings:
WARNING: vmlinux.o(.text+0x14c8): Section mismatch: reference to .init.data:vsyscall_int80_start (between 'fiddle_vdso' and 'xen_setup_features')
WARNING: vmlinux.o(.text.head+0x247): Section mismatch: reference to .init.text.1:start_kernel (between 'is386' and 'check_x87')
Applying the patch I orginally posted fixed the latter of the two.
The first was fixed by declaring fiddle_vdso __init.
I have tripple chcked that my patch fixes the latter of the two warnings
and it does. So something is different at your place.
Could you send me the exact warning as you see it.
Thanks,
