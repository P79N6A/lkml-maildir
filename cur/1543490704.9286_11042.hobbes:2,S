Hi,
Here is the error message i get:
with 
         Database Buffers = db_block_buffers * db_block_size
         Database Buffers = 16000 * 8192 = 125 MB
SVRMGR> startup
ORA-27123: unable to attach to shared memory segment
Linux Error: 22: Invalid argument
^^^^^^^^^^^
And it works with:
         Database Buffers = db_block_buffers * db_block_size
         Database Buffers = 8000 * 8192 = 62.5 MB
SVRMGR> startup

I have enough shared memory (512MB) and free shows this:
[root@kredel7 background]# free -m    
             total       used       free     shared    buffers

I put the strace output file at 
http://linux.uni-mannheim.de/strace.out
Hope that would help finding the problem.
