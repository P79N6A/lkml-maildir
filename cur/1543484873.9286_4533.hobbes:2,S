I'm not so sure if this is possible effectively. May be yes, may be no.

No. There is difference. Not from mantainer side of course but from
end-user side. Looks like you could not understood that not all peoples
are kernel developers out there :-)) From mantainer of NFS and AFS this
breakage is the same PITA, but from end-user point of view there are big
difference: if it's included in tarball then chances are high that with
new releases changes will be done before new release will be put for
download (if this will break ext2fs, for example, then Linus will not
accept patch in first place ;-) and from END USER point of view this
breakage will not be noticeable at all. If something is not included in
tarball then user should wait for mantainer to catch up.

I'm not used neither vgrep nor some other grep. Looks like you really do
not want understood that there are exist some peoples except of kernel
developers. For THEM it's big difference if something is included in
tarball or not...
