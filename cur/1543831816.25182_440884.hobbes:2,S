there are 3 effects i can see:
firstly, allnoconfig implies SMP off, so the spinlock init in 
init_waitqueue_head() is not done and it becomes a 2-instruction thing.
secondly, the savings depend on the function size. Uninlining from a 
small function (that makes use of the inlined function) can be a loss if 
the function call causes more register clobbering. For large functions 
we clobber all registers anyway so there's no extra stack saving, etc. 
the allnoconfig kernel makes use of these waitqueue ops in smaller 
kernel-core functions as well, where the uninlining is a loss. 
(sleep_on(), etc.) Furthermore, UP kernel tends to decrease function 
sizes too.
larger kernel configs include more non-core subsystems/drivers as well, 
which tend to have larger function sizes. There the uninlining win is 
larger.
there's a third, smaller effect too: gcc manages to do tail-merging of 
the init_waitqueue_head calls, in a handful of cases, further reducing 
the cost. I found no such tail-merges done for the 53 callsites in the 
allnoconfig kernel.
