Subject: [PATCH 1/4] cpusets oom_kill tweaks
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/9/1/51

This patch applies a few comment and code cleanups to mm/oom_kill.c
prior to applying a few small patches to improve cpuset management of
memory placement.
The comment changed in oom_kill.c was seriously misleading.  The code
layout change in select_bad_process() makes room for adding another
condition on which a process can be spared the oom killer (see the
subsequent cpuset_nodes_overlap patch for this addition).
Also a couple typos and spellos that bugged me, while I was here.
This patch should have no material affect.
