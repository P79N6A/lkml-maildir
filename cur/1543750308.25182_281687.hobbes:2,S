How about adding a loglevel to this printk() while you are at it?  like 
this for instance:
	printk(KERN_ERR "Please append a correct \"root=\" boot option\n");
or maybe that should be KERN_CRIT ...

^^^ And here I think a loglevel of KERN_INFO would be resonable :
	printk (KERN_INFO "Waiting 5 seconds to try mounting root fs again...\n");

I could be mistaken, but I would have said that msleep would have been 
better here.???

^^^ and this one : 
	panic(KERN_CRIT "VFS: Unable to mount root fs on %s", __bdevname(ROOT_DEV, b));
