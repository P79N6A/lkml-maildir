I also saw weird errors when I (very briefly) ran 2.6.9-rc1-mm1
on my News server.
- scp of a newly created file to another box failed with an I/O error
- md5sums of newly created files were incorrect
- NFS mount request to this box failed with permission denied
I don't have time to investigate further, but I've experienced no
problems with either 2.6.9-rc1 or 2.6.8.1-mm4. All local file
systems were ext3, btw.
