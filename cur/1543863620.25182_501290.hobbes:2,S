And why not just leave it in the pagecache and be done with it?
All you need is to do a writeout before a direct IO read, which is
what generic dio code does.
I guess you'll say that direct writes still need to remove pages,
but in that case you'll either have to live with some racyness
(which is what the generic code does), or have a higher level
synchronisation to prevent buffered + direct IO writes I suppose?

It would have been nice to make that one into a more potentially
useful generic callback.
But why was it introduced, exactly? I can't tell from the code or
the discussion why NFS couldn't start the IO, and signal the caller
to wait_on_page_writeback and retry? That seemed to me like the
convetional fix.
