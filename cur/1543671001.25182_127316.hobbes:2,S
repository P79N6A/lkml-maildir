Code actually implements 'subject' so direct IO to user memory
for IDE specific taskfile ioctl. As a side effect it also cleans
scsi_ioctl.c a little.

No, it is not equivalent, it does much, much more then O_DIRECT.
And this ioctl has been here for ages, only now it gets direct IO.

It can be used for _any_ access to IDE drive, even for some diagnostic
or vendor specific commands. User decides on transfer protocol
(PIO/DMA/queued DMA), addressing mode (CHS/LBA28/LBA48) etc.
User also gets drive status after command completion etc.
The main goal of the patch is to bring internal kernel handling
of this ioctl closer to kernel handling of normal fs IO, so only
_one_ common code will be used in future (benefits desribed in annonce).
Hope this helps...
