The following looks bogus:
 config KEXEC
        bool "kexec system call (EXPERIMENTAL)"
-       depends on EXPERIMENTAL
+       depends on EXPERIMENTAL && (!X86_VOYAGER && SMP)
The dependencies do now say that KEXEC is only offered for machines that 
are _both_ non-Voyager and SMP.
Is the problem you wanted to express that a non-SMP Voyager config 
didn't compile?
AFAIR I recently sent a patch disallowing non-SMP Voyager configurations 
that wasn't yet applied.
