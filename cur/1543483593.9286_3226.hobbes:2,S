I have no control on my SLIP server. Since setting SLIP MTU
to 1500 works for me, I don't want to change it back to 576.
If "mss 576" works, which I doubt, from "man route":
       mss M  Set the TCP Maximum Segment Size (MSS) for  connec-
              tions  over this route to M bytes. This is normally
              used only for fine optimisation of routing  setups.
              The default is 536.
where 536 < 576, shouldn't the kernel just use MTU on the
gateway for mss? Does it look like a kernel bug?
Thanks.
