I got right the same message on my system at boot time
Looks like coming from the SCSI driver; I've an Adaptec 1542 too
Right after loading scsi driver the system locks up and I must
reboot with another kernel such 2.0.*
Only the cdrom is scsi; no discs or tape (and very *old* scsi)
As usual it worked fine with others 2.0.* 
Sorry, as it locked up at boot time I have no logs 
Pentium 133 AHA-1542 SMC-ULTRA (module) cdrom scsi and discs IDE 
with kernel 2.2.0
