I've found some surprises in my testing of 2.6.0-mm2 on my RH 9 box.
First, 'make menuconfig' doesn't work.  It paints the top 8 or so lines,
and freezes.  gnome-terminal begins using as much CPU as it's allowed. 
This is similar to bug 959 in bugme.osdl.org, but changing CHILD_PENALTY
from 90 to 130 didn't fix the problem.
Second, simply resizing gnome-terminal results in the same behavior. 
Certainly, this may be a gnome thing.
Third, 'rpm' cannot install packages.  It always exists with:
rpmdb: unable to join the environment
error: db4 error(11) from dbenv->open: Resource temporarily unavailable
error: cannot open Packages index using db3 - Resource temporarily
unavailable (11)
error: cannot open Packages database in /var/lib/rpm
11 is EAGAIN, but an strace revealed little to the uninitiated (me).
rpm also fails in the same way with --rebuilddb.  /var/lib/rpm/__db.001
is zero length BTW.  That is almost certainly wrong.  Of course, these
both work fine with a 2.4.20 kernel.
Sorry if these (or some variant thereof) have already been reported
here.
Thanks for your time, and please note that I'm not subscribed to
linux-kernel.  If you need more info, please don't hesitate to ask.
