the interesting bit in your program is that it allows normal user to
bypass RLIMIT_DATA resource limit because MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS
memory mappings do not honour RLIMIT_DATA resource limit under Linux.
they do however honour RLIMIT_AS (address space) so just use setrlimit(2)
to arrange for your program to fail as expected... it works for me under
2.4.0-test6-pre1.
Hope this helps,
Tigran
