Hmmm, is this a lock latency or just noticing that write() takes a long
time?
It's probably this:
	if (chunk.nr == 0 && need_resched) {
I'll bet the latencies go away when you drop the chunk.nr test.  If so
I'll need to benchmark if we want to submit before the schedule
(probably yes, as long as we've already sent down some buffers
previously).
(BTW, this code is only in the -suse patchset, data=ordered adds many
new places for possible latencies)
