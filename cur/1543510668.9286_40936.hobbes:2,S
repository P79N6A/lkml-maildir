How do actual filesystems handle that? I guess they do nothing like that.
My quick'n'dirty idea would be this one: let userspace do the lookup and
let kernel store a small table of recently used U/GID's. The architecture
could look like that:
userspace: xfs_daemon knows where to find tables to match xFS ID's against
 Linux ID's (or which server to ask and how to ask), it just polls on a
 kind of kernel-daemon-connection and waits for questions to answer on.
 [(Cache) Table of matches]<----[poll]
				  ^
                                  |
kernel: [small cache]---------->[call (in generic VFS level)]
           /\   ^------,
        [acl code] [other fs-stuff]
 The VFS just calls the special FS (as usually done) which then tries to
 find all necessary info in its cache and calls the attached userspace
 daemon (by leaving a semi-permanent system call) and expects the
 required info in the next call of that system call
 this system call could lead into VFS so that we only need one daemon to
 do this work (which could be started on bootup)
The syscall (as an example): 
 int sys_idmatch(struct s_fsmatch*);
 
 struct s_fsmatch{
	int fsid;/*id of the filesystem we need to match*/
	int state;/*user->kernel errormessages*/
	void*foreign;/*bigenough buffer for foreign ID's*/
	uid_t native;/*native (Linux) representation*/
 }
 return value: the kind of request - examples: 
	FSM_UID		request a UID match
	FSM_GID		request a GID match
	FSM_BUF		request to resize the buffer (native contains 
			size)
	FSM_REGIST	register a newly mounted fs (foreign contains all
			info needed to find the match-table)
	etc.
 the trick here is that the daemon delivers the answer on a request in the
 same struct as it gets the next request (perhaps some minutes or hours
 later) when the syscall returns.
ok, I've only struggled around with commenting in/out DEBUG-macros, yet.
So i don't know how difficult this kind of syscall/daemon pair would be to
implement and debug, but I think it is a) easier and more flexible than
fully kernel-side solutions and b) much better than doing nothing.

agreed, but we should invest at least some hours in the design - nothing
becomes more permanent than temporary solutions :-(
