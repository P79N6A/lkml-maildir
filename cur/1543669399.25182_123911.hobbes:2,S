I missed the original post in this thread, but I can confirm that
2.4.18, 2.4.19, and various 2.5 kernels have worked fine on 4 and 8 MB
RAM, 486 laptops here.
I demonstrated X, the Apache webserver with support for PHP, and Lynx
running in 4 MB of RAM last year.
Quite a lot of useful work can be done in 8 MB RAM, with no swap, and
that allows you to spin down the disk and make the batteries last
longer, (on a laptop).
Have a look at:

for some configuration suggestions.
