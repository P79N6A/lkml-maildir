In that case we should use __func__.
But we discussed this at some length 3-4 years ago and decided to use
__FUNCTION__.  I don't remember why.  Perhaps problems with gcc support for
__func__?
(It could have been that compile-time string concatenation was involved:
        printf("xxx" __FILE__);			/* works */
        printf("xxx" __FUNCTION__);		/* doesn't */
Or not.)
