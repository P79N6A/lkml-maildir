Hi Peter,
One simple comment - please don't use __initfunc, use __init. Respect the
work of someone who went through hundreds (a thousand?) files or so
tediously changing everything from __initfunc() to __init (ok, I am
biased because it was your humble servant :)
Btw, same applies to James Manning changing everything to use structure
name tags and I just noticed the watchdog author is going back to the "old
ways" - I may just send him a patch...
Regards,
Tigran.
