Probably.  I have witnessed network RX causing memory corruption,
before the kexec code started downing the network interfaces on
the user space side. I suspect data capture from sound cards or
video capture cards would have the same issue.  
The way I have observed this in the past is to kexec memtest86,
on a machine with known good memory, and then attempt to ping it :)
What especially worries me about the low 16MB is that it is the
DMA zone for ISA devices.  Old sound cards in particular.  Most
of that is output but....
