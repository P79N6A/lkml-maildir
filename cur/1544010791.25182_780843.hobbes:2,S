Subject: Re: [PATCH] cifs: make sure that DFS pathnames are properly formed

This fix looks correct and urgent, although if we have time I would
like to try it for another day before requesting merge to linux-2.6
The dfs documentation does state that we should be sending \ rather
than \\ (although earlier places in the document stated the reverse,
it is more clear later in the network documentation).
