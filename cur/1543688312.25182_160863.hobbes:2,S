Hi,
I modified scripts/checkconfig.pl to make checkversion.pl.
It checks for cases of <linux/version.h> #included but not
needed (which makes for more rebuilds than required) and for
cases of <linux/version.h> not #included when macros from it
are used.  (Thanks for Randy Hron for some updates to it.)
You can get it from (for future updates; also attached)
