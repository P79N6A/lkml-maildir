Hi Jeff,
Easier said than done.  I could add a new bit to the device blacklist that
covers timeouts.   However, one of the timeouts pops during the scsi
inquiry, before we've even identified the device type.  
Let me review the changes to make this patch device-dependent:
-- add a new bitfield to the blacklist (in scsi_scan.c) for timeouts
-- add new fields to struct scsi_device that hold timeout values
-- make changes in various places to use the timeout value that
   was stored in Scsi_Device, including, possibly, no longer passing 
   the timeout as a subroutine arg.
This would be a consderably larger, possibly controversial patch.  
I suppose I can do it if that's what is needed, but I thought I'd opt
for the minimal, 'tactical' first, dirty as it is.
My goal is to get the fix in there, and make everybody happy in the 
process.  How should I proceed?
