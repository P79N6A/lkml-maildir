It is technically possible.  BIOS is just software, just like the OS.
It's just a huge pain in the butt, because the kernel might accidentally
stomp on some resources the BIOS secretly set up, or somesuch.

IDE is special.
This is due to how the BIOS sets up an IDE PCI device in legacy mode.
BAR0-3 are set to zero, which is a signal to the OS that the IDE PCI
device is in legacy mode (io 0x1f0+0x170, irq 14+15).  Since the IDE I/O
ports are in ISA space not PCI space, the PCI BARs reflect nothing.
