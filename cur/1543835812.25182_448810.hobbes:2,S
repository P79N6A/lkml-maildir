Then you don't have redundancy, at least not for reliability.  In that 
case, you have redundancy for speed.

Reasonably, yes.  But it will be an online repacker, so it will be 
somewhat tolerant of this.

Aha.  That really depends how you're doing the mirroring.
If you're doing it at the block level, then no, it won't work.  But if 
you're doing it at the filesystem level (a cluster-based FS, or 
something that layers on top of an FS), or (most likely) the 
database/application level, then when you come back up, the new data is 
just pulled in from the logs as if it had been written to the FS.
The only example I can think of that I've actually used and seen working 
is MySQL tables, but that already covers a huge number of websites.

Hmm, if that could be done right, it wouldn't be so bad -- if you get 
twice the performance but have to repack for 2 hrs at the end of the 
week, repacker is better, right?  So if you could spread the 2 hours out 
over the week, in theory, you'd still be pretty close to twice the 
performance.
But that is fairly difficult to do, and may be more difficult to do well 
than to implement, say, a Reiser4 plugin that operates about on the 
level of rsync, but on every file modification.

Yikes.  But then, that may be a failure of distro maintainers for not 
throwing it in cron for them.
I had a similar problem with MySQL.  I turned on binary logging so I 
could do database replication, but I didn't realize I had to actually 
delete the logs.  I now have a daily cron job that wipes out everything 
except the last day's logs.  It could probably be modified pretty easily 
to run hourly, if I needed to.
Moral of the story?  Maybe there's something to this "continuous 
repacker" idea, but don't ruin a good thing for the rest of us because 
of newbies.
