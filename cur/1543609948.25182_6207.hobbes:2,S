It does not seem so. I included several seconds of mdelay() (and lots of
printk()'s) while I was debugging, and that didnt change a thing. I added
a.o. 4 seconds of mdelay() right before the open(), and 2 seconds right
after the open() and the two dup()'s. The storage device was detected at
the beginning of that last delay. Me thinks this is related to the open().
I added a total of 10 seconds of mdelay() between do_basic_setup() (where
the usb is initialized) and the open(). That is much more time than it
takes to init the USB storage device.
