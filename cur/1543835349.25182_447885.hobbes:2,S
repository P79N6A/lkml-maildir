Well I "sometimes" do that, i.e. intentionally turning off quota on the 
running system, to force a recheck on boot. The mount options essentially
are /bin/mount /dev/hda2 / -o ro,usrquota,grpquota and then /bin/mount / -o 
remount,rw
No breakage so far, which is why I wondered. Is it limited to a specific 
kernel version?
