Are you sure? Doesn't sigsetjmp() call sigprocmask in order to obtain
the current signal mask?
In the glibc I read:
int
__sigjmp_save (sigjmp_buf env, int savemask)
{
  env[0].__mask_was_saved = (savemask &&
                             __sigprocmask (SIG_BLOCK, (sigset_t *) NULL,
                                            &env[0].__saved_mask) == 0);
  return 0;
}
*sigh* things could be so easy if there was a working pselect()...
