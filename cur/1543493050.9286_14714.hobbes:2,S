Subject: Problem with 2.2.3, setuid and shared libraries

	I compiled an application with egcs 1.1.1 and all went ok. When I
install the main binary under /usr/local/bin and setuid it to root some
shared libraries didn't load. ldd could not see them. I set file
attributes to 555 and all work ok, but when I reset to 4555 shared
libraries disapperar in the ldd dump. All this happends when in no
superuser mode, in superuser mode it works fine.
	I have tested this on 2.2.3 (at home) with ldd 1.9.10-1
from Debian 2.1 slink. I dont see the problem with the same configuration
using linux 2.2.5 (at work) and the same version of binutils. I thought it
was related with directory location of libraries, but that not the case. 
	Its me, its related with ldd and permissions or its related
with kernel???
Thanks in advance
