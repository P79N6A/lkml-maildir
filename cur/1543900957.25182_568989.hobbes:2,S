Hello Roland,
        FYI, we are working on several IPoIB performance improvement 
patches which are not on the list. Some of the patches are under test, 
some of the patches are going to be submitted soon. They are:
1.  skb aggregations for both dev xmit(networking layer) and IPoIB send 
(it will be submitted soon, for both UD and RC mode)
2.  multiple interrupt vectors in IPoIB for multiple links scalability 
(working on patch for both UD and RC mode)
3.  split CQ and send completion aggregation (for both UD and RC mode)
4.  LRO for IPoIB when generic LRO is available in networking layer. (UD 
mode only)
        Some of them might be made in 2.6.23 timeline, some of them might 
not, it depends on our test progress and community review feedback.
Thanks
Shirley
