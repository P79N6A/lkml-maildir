So I take your word that NFS does not impose this restraint,
which means filesystems could choose their own alignment
requirement that makes sense. So it would not be too horrible
if tmpfs chooses to be liberal.
In fact, in the O_DIRECT man page it says:
 O_DIRECT
              [....]  Under Linux 2.4 transfer sizes, and the  alignment  of
              user  buffer and file offset must all be multiples of the logi-
              cal block size of the file system. Under Linux 2.6 alignment to
              512-byte boundaries suffices.
So even Linux 2.4 and 2.6 are different - 2.6 is less restrictive.
My point is that as long as we don't put more restrictions, it should
not cause real problems.
And about Linus..let's put his comment aside because O_DIRECT
is there to stay. :-) In fact, since O_DIRECT is not the most 
beaufitul piece of code in the kernel, what I try to do is just to 
make software developer's life easier by making filesystem 
behavior as close to each other as possible with the minimal
effort.

That's a rather heavy-weight workaround don't you think?

Having looked at the code more closely, the change is probably
not correct. fput(f) apparently does everything cleanup_all does,
and more, despite it's a single call. I guess those names are 
a bit confusing at first glance. :-)

Well, looks like people are not in consensus to add the tmpfs
direct-io support, but since I've looked at the code, it would be
nice to fix this bug though.
The get_xip_page thing you mentioned makes it a bit more
complicated since XIP support is a mount option, not a
register_filesystem time option. If we ought to add a flag somewhere,
where is the right place? vfsmount?
I can cook up a patch for this bug if people think it's worth fixing.
