I'm not sure your question has meaning.
Consider:  ext2 reads sector 1234.  drive returns "media error", and 
then swaps the bad sector for a good one.  Reboot and run badblocks. 
badblocks reads sector 1234, in whatever manner the drive chooses to 
present sector 1234 to the OS.
"original" versus "redirected" block is invisible to the OS.  The OS 
only knows that an event occured at a single point in time -- the media 
error.
