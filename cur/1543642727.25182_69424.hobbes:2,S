When you say 'rmmod modulename' the module is supposed to be removed, if
it can be.  That is the user's expectation, and qualifies as 'obviously
correct'.
Garbage collecting should *not* be the primary mechanism for removing
modules, that is what rmmod is for.  Neither should a filesystem module
magically disappear from the system just because the last mount went
away, unless the module writer very specifically desires that.  This is
where the obfuscating opinion is coming from: Al has come up with an
application where he wants the magic disappearing behavior and wants
to impose it on the rest of the world, regardless of whether it makes
sense.
