   If at boot time we keep a big chunk of ram free at the kernel end and just
   load modules one after each other into that space until we get into real
   paging that problem goes away
And we do have module_map/module_unmap interfaces already so it's
easy to toy with this.
I've always been meaning to do a "alloc 4MB page at boot, lock into
TLB, carve module pages out of that, vmalloc when that runs out" on
sparc64.
