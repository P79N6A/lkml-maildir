Folks,
To take netlink to where we want to use it within the SCSI subsystem (as
the mechanism of choice to replace ioctls), we're going to need to pass
user-space buffer pointers.
What is the best, portable manner to pass a pointer between user and kernel
space within a netlink message ?  The example I've seen is in the iscsi
target code - and it's passed between user-kernel space as a u64, then
typecast to a void *, and later within the bio_map_xxx functions, as an
unsigned long. I assume we are going to continue with this method ?
