Hmm, what terminal emulator do you use? The reasonable ones should
restore the original screen. At least xterm does, and I *think*
gnome-terminal does too (although I'm too lazy to boot up my notebook
and confirm).
(I personally consider alternate screen an abomination. It would be so
nice if the terminal emulators would just make it optional.)
