Ok, aic7xxx hang solved on one machine with APIC solution
Ok, sched.c hang solved on another machine with patch.
However that patch doesn't solve everything and there are a few other 
places where things hang.
*) I20 hangs in the middle of I20 init on -every- system I have from 586 
to pIII in recent kernels
*) something hangs just after floppy init, last line is FDC0...
The FDC is immediately prior to where I2O inits so possibly the hang is 
actually just following FDC/I2O?  Normal boot messages should be like this:
Floppy drive(s): fd0 is 1.44M
FDC 0 is a post-1991 82077

Any comments or suggestions?  2.4.5-ac19 is the last kernel I have that 
works.
