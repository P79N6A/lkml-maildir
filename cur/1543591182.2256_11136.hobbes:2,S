This is the problem with all sorts of ID-based naming.  In this case
the kernel could simply change the conflicting names a bit,
and leave the cleanup to the administrator.  (Who probably
is around as he just inserted those disks....)
The current scheme have problems if you move a disk
from one controller to another, or in some cases
if you merely add a new one.  So the question becomes - 
what is most likely to go wrong?  And you can be
smart and name your partitions /usr21042001, /home03042001
and so on in order to minimize the risk of conflicts.
