I think that would be a fine way to go.

Well if there is 2 requests per disk, that's a good thing; you won't
need to unplug. If there is only 1, then as well as the plugging cost,
the hardeware loses some ability to pipeline things effectively.
I'm not saying the kernel shouldn't be improved in the latter case, but
if you're looking for performance, it is nice to ensure you have at
least 2 requests. Presumably you're using some pretty well tuned db
software though, so I guess this is not always possible.
Do you have stats for these things (queue empty vs not empty events,
unplugs, etc)?

Sounds good!
