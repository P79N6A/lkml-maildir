FreeBSD supports this ATA-RAID. I have got a printout of the sources here. From where did they get
the permissions/code/docs... to put it into their kernel?
Currently I am working on kernel 2.4 RAID support for HPT370 (also included in FreeBSD). I hope it
will work soon. I want to upgrade to debian-woody.
