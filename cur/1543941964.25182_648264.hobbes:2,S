Yes, I'll try to get some comments on the linuxppc-dev mailing list.

I think I had a similar problem with kernel v2.6.23, too and therefore
waited for kernel 2.6.24. So the problem may exist since a long time.

AFAIK start_kernel() is called very early in the boot process, were no
user or kernel thread is active. I also wonder why the kernel crashes when
the mem boot option is used. Let's see what the linuxppc-dev people say.
Thanks for your help!
