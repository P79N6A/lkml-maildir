I tried your patch on 2.6.17-rc6 (fixed up a view rejects) in an attempt to 
get MSI working with my forcedeth NIC, which advertises the capability. The 
kernel now gives me the following:
PCI: Found MSI HT mapping on 0000:00:0b.0

Is the "vendor BIOS" causing the problem? Here's my /proc/interrupts after 
booting.

It's an x86-64 kernel.
