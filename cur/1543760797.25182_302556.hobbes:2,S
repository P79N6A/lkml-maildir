All of the files in drivers/char/drm really should have an explicit
dual MIT/GPL license on them too. The DRM project has been taking
patches back into DRM from LKML without making it clear that DRM is
MIT licensed. It might be construed that doing this has made DRM GPL
without that being the intention.
