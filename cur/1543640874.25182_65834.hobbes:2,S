The hardware in not just used to play mpegs. It is one application that
happens to be running most of the time, and it is the application that
deals with treating the input in such a way.
You want a broader solution, just look at how grafitti input (penstrokes)
is dealt with in for example Qt/Embedded or X11 on the iPaq. No kernel
hacks involved there as far as I can see.

Or have a library that intercepts read() from fd 0 which you link
against applications.
