Just to make sure: Is on the system the Ftape of any joystick driver in
use? If not, then:
The ServerWorks chip set has a bug that is shared with old Intel Neptune
chipset most likely. This is a problem per se, but also triggers the VIA
bug workaround. The VIA bug test can be enhanced to detect this false
alarm, but the Neptune-like bug still stays and is dangerous as well.
At least the VIA workaround told us something fishy is happening on
non-VIA hardware as well.
For example on my VIA686a/cg (late revision), the workaround is never
triggered.
