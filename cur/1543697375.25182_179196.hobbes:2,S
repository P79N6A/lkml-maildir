Hi Pavel,
I have test8 version of the patch which mostly works. The only problem now
is a panic when I remove the mouse... The input layer is sorta hard to follow
you know :) Im guessing it is a reference counting issue. Do you want what I
have now or can I update it to test9 and see if taking a break from staring
at it has helped?
Thanks.
Hanna
