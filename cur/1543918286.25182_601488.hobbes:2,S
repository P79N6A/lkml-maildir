Jimmy, a simple script can generate a link object that
will resolve any kernel symbols for your module without
any "export symbol" stuff at all. This was previously
demonstrated to the enraged few who considered it
immoral. Nevertheless, it's just as moral as bypassing
RIAA copy protection.
Just don't expect the kernel developers to authorize
its use, or show you how to do it!
Cheers,
