Just out of curiosity, Marcelo, when could we see 2.4.21-rc1 ? What is yet
expected to go in before rc, and how long it could take to have 2.4.21 final
out given that no other critical bugs would be discovered?
The release cycle is probably getting indeed kind of ... long; that could be ok
for ie. 2.2, but it would be nice to have shorter development cycle for the
pair of latest two development lines. Sure that the larger changes need to get
enough of testing, but then we could maybe spend the months rather between the
-rc releases than both -pre and -rc releases...?
Thanks in advance,
