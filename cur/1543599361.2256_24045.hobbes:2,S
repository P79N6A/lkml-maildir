The profiles I provided were with SGI's kernprof 0.9.2.  I chose ACG,
which does have a lot of overhead (cg_record_arc and mcount), but also
provides a lot of information.  I have a separate kernel for each
filesystem and each filesystem+profle_patch (10 kernels).  No modules
were used so that all profiles have no 'unknown kernel' functions.  Each
profile was taken for 60 seconds, starting at 90 seconds into the test. 
All profiles were taken on the 44 client test.
