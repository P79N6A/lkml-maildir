Ok, how about this:
for each header file {
	make header.o
1)	if it doesn't build {
		print out a warning
		continue
	}
	for each #include line {
		remove the #include line
		make header.o
2)		if it build {
			print out a warning
		}
3)		if there are less than x gcc warnings {
			print out a warning
		}
	}
}
1) is my old proposal.  2) is the natural counterpart.  3) could be
what you want.  If some header is only needed for something like your
example, we may be able to catch it this way.
Would this work?  Would something else work even better?
