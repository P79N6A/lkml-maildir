I would also add, if the decision comes to make 'real exclusive' cpusets, 
my previous example, as a use for non-exclusive cpusets: 
we are running jobs that need to be 'mostly' isolated on some part of the 
system, and run in a specific location. We use cpusets for that. But we 
can't afford to dedicate a part of the system for administrative tasks 
(daemons, init..). These tasks should not be put inside one of the 
'exclusive' cpusets, even temporary : they do not belong there. They 
should just be allowed to steal a few cpu cycles from time to time : non 
exclusive cpusets are the way to go.
