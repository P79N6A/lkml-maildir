Context switches now are ~370 per second. Still much above the regular ~70
we see in the mainline.
why do you say the rr_interval needs to be scaled with cpus? The basic point
in RSDL is, if we have more than one same priority task on a single logic
cpu, context switch happens every RR_INTERVAL (6 or 12 msec) whereas in
mainline it happens every 100 msec.
We need to minimize these context switches.
