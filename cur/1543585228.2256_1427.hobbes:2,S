That's not nice code from the compiler (suboptimal), but it'll work.
leal -24(%ebp),%esp is perfectly ok in the epilogue of a function.
You're right that %esp is lost -- in this case, %ebp has effectively the
same information.
Think like this: a perfectly normal function (without switch_to) can
have this:
f: pushl %ebp
   movl %esp,%ebp
   pushl %ebx
   ... do stuff, decrement %esp a lot to call functions etc. etc. ...
   movl -4(%ebp),%esp
   popl %ebx
   popl %ebp
   ret
