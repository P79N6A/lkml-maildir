The best thing to do in such case is to press SYSRQ+P and to grab lots of
different EIP addresses. If SYSRQ+P does nothing then it's an hard lockup
and in such case the NMI oopser will help you.
So I suggest you to use the IKD patch and to enable only the NMI oopser.
If at lockup time you won't see a stack trace, then press SYSRQ+P and
report us the interesting EIP addresses (the System.map is necessary to
resolve them later). Thanks.
