Can't say exactly when but my MIPS RISC Architecture manual
for the R2000/R3000 shows it to be a _strictly_ 32 bit
architecture in 1988 and i distinctly remember the working
with the newest R400x in 1993 which was still 32bit.  I
know MIPS went to 64bit sometime not too long after that
(mid 90's?) but by then Alpha and Sparc had beaten them to
the punch.
