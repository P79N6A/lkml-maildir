Actually, this works pretty well.
The regular Makefiles are moving in this direction (replacing .a files
with .o files), and I haven't seen any problems as a result.  Have you?
The disadvantage of .o files is that mistakes in the Makefiles may cause
the kernel to get a little bigger than it needs to be, and no one will
notice.  It's a simplicity-versus-size trade-off.

*Two* cases are not covered: references from modules, and code that
has an init section.

Interesting.  IMHO it would be simpler to change video.a to video.o.
But I would be comfortable with "force_link" if Linus prefers that approach.
