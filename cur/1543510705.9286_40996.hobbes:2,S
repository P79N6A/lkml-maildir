After booting 2.2.13pre9-13, the system was acting very funny.  WTMP was
busted and ps would core.

etc..
I noticed a bunch of warnings from fp-emul, but I don't think the caused
procps and the wtmp to be corrupted.  I've also noticed problems with the
pyxis stuff for vga console:
vgacon.c:748: warning: passing arg 2 of `pyxis_bw_writeb' makes integer
from pointer without a cast
vgacon.c:751: warning: passing arg 1 of `pyxis_bw_readb' makes integer from
pointer without a cast
vgacon.c:763: warning: passing arg 2 of `pyxis_bw_writeb' makes integer
from pointer without a cast
vgacon.c:766: warning: passing arg 1 of `pyxis_bw_readb' makes integer from
pointer without a cast
I'm guessing these are the cause of some PYXIS errors in some of my systems
that have PCI video boards (on the 21164sx).
I've also had problems with egcs compiler errors when running 2.2.13pre13.

Hey, do they test this stuff before it's released?  
Sure they do... "it compiles, it's ready!"
