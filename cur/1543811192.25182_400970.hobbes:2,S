DEAR BELOVED,
I am MISS MARIA BAHIE and am 26 years of age. I I happen to be the only 
surviving daughter/child of LATE MR. PATRICK BAHIE.
I have decided to contact you over a desperate and pitiable situation in 
which I find myself after loosing my parents and siblings to the civil 
crises in my country. I am left alone in the world.
I must inform you that most of my our familyâs assets and funds were 
either looted or vandalized by my fatherâs business partners and 
governmentâs authorities.
At the moment, I need your cordial assistance in receiving a fund worth of 
US$18M. This fund was deposited by my late father as family belongings 
with a private security firm.
I would need your assistance in receiving and investing this funds as well 
as helping me in obtaining traveling documents to your country or any 
other western country to enable me finish my education.
I am ready to provide you with all the relevant information related to 
this deposit including all documents.
Again, my whole life will be a mess if nothing is done urgently to receive 
this funds as all my livelihood now lies on this funds. Please in any way 
you can be of help to me do as you will not only help me as a person 
rather you will be helping humanity in general.
Furthermore, I will be looking forward to your quick response to this 
effect as I will welcome your suggestions on way forward including your 
conditions of assistance.
More so, I have decided to compensate your much needed assistance with 20% 
of the total sum while any expenses you will incur in the course of the 
transaction will be refunded as soon as the business is done.
Be informed that, I am doing things on my own for now and I do not see any 
form of risk in the transaction as long as we will continue this 
transaction between us at least until I travel out from these wicked 
people.
I will wait for to hear from you as soon as possible.
Regards,
Maria Bahie
