Hey, I just saw the recent announcement of procps-3.0.1 on the mailing 
list by the procps.sourceforge.net team, what is the status of these two 
projects, there are features in each that are very nice, the versioning is 
confusing, and inconsistant, and the package names are the same...
Kinda hoping to learn which tree a distribution developer should follow, 
etc.
TIA,
