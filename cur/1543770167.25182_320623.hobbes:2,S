I don't understand the failure mode of acpi_tb_get_rsdt_address, it seems to always return what should be a valid pointer.  Please explain, thanks.
    if (AcpiGbl_RSDP->Revision < 2)
    {
        OutAddress->Pointer.Value = AcpiGbl_RSDP->RsdtPhysicalAddress;
    }
    else
    {
        OutAddress->Pointer.Value = ACPI_GET_ADDRESS (
            AcpiGbl_RSDP->XsdtPhysicalAddress);
    }
