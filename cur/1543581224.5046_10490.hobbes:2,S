sorry, but exactly what code are you comparing this to? The aio code you
sent a few days ago does not do this either. (And you did not answer my
questions regarding this issue.) What i saw is some scheme that at a point
relies on keventd (a kernel thread) to do the blocking stuff. [or, unless
i have misread the code, does the ->bmap() synchronously.]
indeed an asynchron ll_rw_block() is possible and desirable (and not hard
at all - all structures are interrupt-safe already, opposed to the kiovec
code), but this is only half of the story. What is the big issue for me is
an async ->bmap(). And we wont access ext2fs data structures from IRQ
handlers anytime soon - so true async IO right now is damn near
impossible. No matter what the IO-submission interface is: kiobufs/kiovecs
or bhs/requests.
