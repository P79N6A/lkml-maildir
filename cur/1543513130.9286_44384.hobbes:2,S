How is this different from immutable files (as supported by ext2) and setting
the securelevel to non-zero?
I see it is independent of the fs, which is good. But it should be possible to
activate the security level at runtime.
However, I admit that as soon as it has logging support it will be useful. It
will not prevent modifying the files though, unless you also disable access to
the raw device.
