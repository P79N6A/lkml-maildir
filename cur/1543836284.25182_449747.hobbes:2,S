But it does not support splitting them into page sized chunks, so it
requires the whole jumbo frame allocation in one contiguous chunk, 9k
will be transferred into 16k allocation (order 3), since SLAB uses
power-of-2 allocation.

You will almost 100% reproduce it after "find / > /dev/null".

It can not be debugged - you have cought a memory fragmentation problem,
which is quite common.

e1000 tries to allocate 3-order pages atomically?
Well, that's wrong.
