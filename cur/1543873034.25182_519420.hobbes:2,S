i think Mike's testcase was even simpler than that: two plain CPU hogs 
on nice +5 stole much more CPU time with Con's new interactivity code 
than they did with the current interactivity code. I'd agree with Mike 
that a phenomenon like that needs to be fixed.
/less/ interactivity we can do easily in the current scheduler: just 
remove various bits here and there. The RSDL promise is that it gives us 
/more/ interactivity (with 'interactivity designed in', etc.), which in 
Mike's testcase does not seem to be the case.

yeah. It's a hard case because X is not always a _clear_ interactive 
task - still the current interactivity code handles it quite well.
but Mike's scenario wasnt even that complex. It wasnt even a hard case 
of X being starved by _other_ interactive tasks running on the same nice 
level. Mike's test-scenario was about two plain nice +5 CPU hogs 
starving nice +0 interactive tasks more than the current scheduler does, 
and this is really not an area where we want to see any regression. Con, 
could you work on this area a bit more?
