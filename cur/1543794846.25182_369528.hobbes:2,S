The standards are insufficient however.  For example dealing with named 
streams or extended attributes if exposed as "normal files" would 
naturally have the same st_ino (given they are the same inode as the 
normal file data) and st_dev fields.

Now that is true.  In addition to checking the link count is larger then 
1, they should check the file size and if that matches compute the SHA-1 
digest of the data (or the MD5 sum or whatever) and probably should also 
check the various stat fields for equality before bothering with the 
checksum of the file contents.
Or Linux just needs a backup api that programs like this can use to 
save/restore files.  (Analogous to the MS Backup API but hopefully 
less horid...)
