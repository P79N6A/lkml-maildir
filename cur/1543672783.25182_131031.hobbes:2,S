IANAL, but Linux drivers are usually licensed under the GPL and not LGPL.

You mean one big file versus many small fragments? I don't think there
is a difference. LGPL would permit that (in fact, it seems to be the
difference between GPL and LGPL).

That's different, the modules are not (generally) derivatives of the
kernel. The (running) kernel is a derivative of both the GPL code and
binary drivers (all parts are linked at run time) - and while you can't
distribute such a beast at all, you usually don't want to.
(which makes me wonder if "distributing" a running machine with binary
drivers linked to the kernel is legal :-) )

IMHO it's independent problem, not related to the license, but rather
to source code symbol names (a technical and not legal issue - something
like copy-protection mechanisms).

Build - sure. However, distributing such a system (with GPLed parts)
would be illegal, unless the GPLed code is not a part of the system,
and rather an "independent and separate work" (i.e. the system does not
"depend" on GPL part).
