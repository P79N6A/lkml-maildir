Before you read this, I just wanted to see how many times I could login.
I would never need 1000+ users support, but others may need it.
So I was just curious to see how many times I could login with ssh
version 1.
I put in 2048 for the number of ptys allowed for the kernel options,
recompiled and installed.
I made a little expect script which would log me in the next time
I login and so on and so forth.
After I logged in 1013? times or so it said "you are out of ptys..."
Once again I have no need for this amount of users, but I was curious,
how many simultaneous users can be logged on to a linux box at one time?
I'll guess @ 1024 considering I had some xterm's open.
Anyone?
