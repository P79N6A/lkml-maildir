Hi.
I've been reading the code in arch/i386/kernel/time.c and I think I
see a what should be a bug in do_fast_gettimeoffset(), but I can not
trigger it.  So I wonder what I'm missing...
The bug I think I see concerns the tsc_low_delta calculation during
the period of time when the low 32 bits of the x86 tsc are about to
wrap.  It appears to me that if a timer_interrupt runs just before the
wrap, and then gettimeoffset runs just after the wrap, then the line
eax -= last_tsc_low will produce a value close to 2^32.  So, all calls
to do_gettimeofday will warp forward in time (eg by about 10s on a
400MHz machine) for the duration of the tick.
However, I can not cause this to actually happen...
Why is it safe to compute this tsc_low_delta using only the low 32
bits of the tsc?
