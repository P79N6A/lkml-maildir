I was wrong about it crashing, but it will not crash only for shmfs,
if you want to export that to MAP_SHARED on other fs, you won't be
allowed anymore to depending on this shmfs speciaility of delete_inode
being recalled only during unlink. I don't see how depending on this
subtle detail to free the mpol could ever be an improvement instead of
doing in destroy_inode where it belongs to.
