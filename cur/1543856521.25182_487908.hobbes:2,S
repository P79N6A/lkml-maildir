This PC has 1 ethernet interface, an e1000. Ubuntu Dapper.
On 2.6.14, my e1000 interface appears as eth0.
On 2.6.15 to 2.6.18, my e1000 interface appears as eth1.
In both cases, there are no other ethX interfaces listed in
"ifconfig -a". There are no modules involved, just a static
kernel build.
Is this a bug in udev, or the kernel? I'm presuming udev,
but seems odd it changes over a kernel release boundary.
Any ideas on how I get rid of it? Makes automatic switching
between kernel versions a royal pain in the ass.
