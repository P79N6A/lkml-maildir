Another possibility would be to add a more flexible error handling
infrastructure controllable from user space. Think for example of
hotpluggable devices. Either we add support for this to all subsystems or
we add generic support at a higher level. A single daemon could ask the
user to replug the disk or temporarily save a the dirty pages to a
different device.
