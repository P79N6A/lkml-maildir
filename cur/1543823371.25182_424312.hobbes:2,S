I cannot offer much other than some random confirmation that from my own
oprofiling, whatever I did (often running a load test script consisting of
launching 30 big apps at the same time), find_vma basically always showed up
very prominently in the list of vmlinux-based code (always ranking within the
top 4 or 5 kernel hotspots, such as timer interrupts, ACPI idle I/O etc.pp.).
call-tracing showed it originating from mmap syscalls etc., and AFAIR quite
some find_vma activity from oprofile itself.
Profiling done on 512MB UP Athlon and P3/700, 2.6.16ish, current Debian.
Sorry for the foggy report, I don't have those logs here right now.
So yes, improving that part should help in general, but I cannot quite
say that my machines are "constrained" by it.
But you probably knew that already, otherwise you wouldn't have poked
in there... ;)
