Hi...
When I insert + mount a cdrom and then put this powerbook to sleep mode,
I keep getting these messages in the kernel log when the machine wakes
up. However I can still access the cdrom on its mount point as if
everything was ok... but is it ?
This is kernel 2.6.7-rc2 on powerbook g4 1Ghz.
Please comment,
Regards,
Soeren.
