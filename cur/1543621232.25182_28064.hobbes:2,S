Hello !!!
I am trying to develop a line analyzer to my multi-serial card but I am not 
seeing a good solution to send data from the driver to the application in the 
user-space.
Inittialy, I thought in use a char device, but all my minors are beeing used 
and I don't wanna to use another major. 
I'd like to know two things:
1 - Is there any way to use more than 256 minors under a major
2 - Is there a simple way to send data from the kernel-space to the 
user-space?
Any help is very welcome
thanks in advance
