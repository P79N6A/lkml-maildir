I don't believe mmiowb() is at all the same thing.  mmiowb() is all
about ordering writes between _different_ CPUs without incurring the
cost of flushing posted writes by issuing a read on the bus.  wc_wmb()
would just act like a true wmb(), even when using write-combining
regions on x86 -- in other words, there would be no cross-CPU synchronization.
