Well, it sounds like a good start, though I'll have to get up to scratch
on the array of scheduler badness programs!
I expect throughput to be down in this release due to the timeslice thing.
This should be fixable.
I think either there is a bug in my accounting somewhere or I have not quite
thought it though properly because priorities don't seem to get distributed
well. Also its not using the nanosecond timing stuff (yet). This might help
a bit.
