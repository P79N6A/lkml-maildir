So your are blacklisting certain drivers? If so, you probably
should have an array containing their names plus a header-file
into which the hundreds, perhaps thousands, of future module-
names can be added.
... Not meant as a joke or an affront. User's should be able to
know what hardware to NOT purchase because of the proprietary
nature of their drivers. Putting a couple "exceptions" into
code as above is not good coding practice. If you need to
exclude stuff, there should be an exclusion procedure that
treats all that stuff equally, no?
Cheers,
