Folks,
Bartlomiej has bullied me into trying to bring the ataraid driver into the 2.5 
world. I have so far created suitable build files and have started to look 
into the code changes. I have looked through the mail archives but it is very 
hard to find the right thing. So I would like to check:
1. the old code uses   MINOR(bh->b_rdev) to get the minor number of the 
ataraid device. Can I use   minor(bh->b_bdev->bd_inode->i_rdev)   to replace 
that?
[I am tempted to create an inline fn buffer_to_minor() for this purpose and 
put it in ataraid.h.]
2. the old code, in split_request, writes to b_rsector (2.4: the real sector 
on the disk) which has no obvious equivalent in 2.5. Can someone point me to 
a suitable file or email that I can use to resolve this?
Any other pointers accepted.
Thanks
Ruth
