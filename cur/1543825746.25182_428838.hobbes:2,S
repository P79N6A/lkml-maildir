The trade-off is that if I have a 15k rpm SCSI drive, it would take a 
lot of design changes to make it spin up quickly, and improve a function 
which is usually done on a server once every MTBF when replacing the 
failed unit.
I think the majority of very large or very fast drives are in systems 
which don't (deliberately) power cycles often, in rooms where heat is an 
issue. And to spin up quickly take a larger power supply... 30 sec is 
fine with most users.
Couldn't find a spin-up time for the new Seagate 750GB drive, but the 
seek sure is fast!

   Obscure bug of 2004: BASH BUFFER OVERFLOW - if bash is being run by a
normal user and is setuid root, with the "vi" line edit mode selected,
and the character set is "big5," an off-by-one errors occurs during
wildcard (glob) expansion.
