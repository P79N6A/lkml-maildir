Hi Geert,

There is now UTF there :-)
Both Marcin and Martin are the same name, the difference is that Marcin is
a Polish version - this is the correct spelling as far as Polish is concerned.
It is like John and Johann I guess; or Paul and Pavel (Pavel is Czech
here)
There are issues with names sometimes. eg. I can say that I am Maciej or
I can say I am Maciek. And it is perfectly fine. No spelling mistakes
there.
Regards,
Maciej
