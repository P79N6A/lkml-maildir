Actually I think the only way to get it right is to do it in the core
(or inm the architecture code for the really nasty bits of course), but
then again this isn't the point I want to make here..

.. and this is where we get into problems.  There should be no need to
use all kinds of pseudo-OO obsfucation to get there.  A VMA flag that
means 'this is hugetlb backed anonymous memory' is much nicer to archive
this.  Because it makes clear there is exactly one special case here
and no carte blanche for drivers to do whatever they want.  I would prefer
to even get rid of that single special case as mentioned above, but I'm
definitly set dead against at making this special case totally open for
random bits of the kernel to mess with.

Hopefully not, doing this in a driver would be utterly braindead and
certainly not mergeable.
