volatile means what it means, is usefull and is right. If it is used
in kernel for other things apart from what it was designed for it is
kernel or programmer responsibility. It does not mention nothing about
locking.
A more real example:
#include <stdint.h>
//volatile
uint32_t spinvar = 1;
uint32_t mtx;
void lock(uint32_t* l)
{   
    *l = 1;
}
void unlock(uint32_t* l)
{
    *l = 0;
}
void spin()
{
    uint32_t local;
    for (;;)
    {
        lock(&mtx);
        local = spinvar;
        unlock(&mtx);
        if (!local)
            break;
    }
}
without the volatile:
spin:
    pushl   %ebp
    movl    spinvar, %eax
    movl    %esp, %ebp
    testl   %eax, %eax
    je  .L7
.L10:
    jmp .L10
.L7:
    movl    $0, mtx
    popl    %ebp
    ret
so the compiler did something like
   local = spinvar;
   if (local)
	for (;;);
(notice the dead lock/unlock inlined code elimination).
With the volatile, the code is correct:
spin:
    pushl   %ebp
    movl    %esp, %ebp
    .p2align 4,,7
.L7:
    movl    spinvar, %eax
    testl   %eax, %eax
    jne .L7
    movl    $0, mtx
    popl    %ebp
    ret
So think about all you inlined spinlocks, mutexes and so on.
And if you do
void lock(volatile uint32_t* l)
...
void unlock(volatile uint32_t* l)
...
the code is even better:
spin:
    pushl   %ebp
    movl    %esp, %ebp
    .p2align 4,,7
.L7:
    movl    $1, mtx    <=========
    movl    spinvar, %eax
    movl    $0, mtx    <=========
    testl   %eax, %eax
    jne .L7
    popl    %ebp
    ret
So volatile just means 'dont trust this does not change even you don't see
why'.
