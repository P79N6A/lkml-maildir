Lots of confusion comes from this, and often people think their pc suddenly 
uses a lot less cpu when they change from 1000HZ to 100HZ and use this as an 
argument/reason for changing to 100HZ when in fact the massive _reported_ 
difference is simply worse accounting. Of course there is more overhead going 
from 100 to 1000 but it doesn't suddenly make your apps use 10 times more 
cpu.
