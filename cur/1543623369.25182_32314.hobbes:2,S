Both HIMEM (on CPU) and NUMA nodes remind me somewhat of the days when
"band switched" memory was supposed to be the answer to limited addressing
space. The trick was to have things in the right place and not eat up the
capacity with moving data. I think you're right that the problem is not as
simple several posters have suggested. I'm afraid someone will have to do
some clever adaptive work here, the speed of the connects to the memory
will change as both evolve. And it's easier to make a node smaller than
put them closer together. 
I'm awaiting the IBM paper(s) on this, I don't find my Hypercube and PVM
experience to fit well anymore :-(
