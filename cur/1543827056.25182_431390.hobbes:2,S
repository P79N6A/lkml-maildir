That's plainly silly.  Like everything else in life, it is a balance of 
costs.
At some point, ext3's fs-feature-flag approach increases the 
combinations of metadata variants you must support exponentially.
Moving to extents and 48bit (which I want) is a big enough step that, 
IMO, some of the support costs become far more obvious.
