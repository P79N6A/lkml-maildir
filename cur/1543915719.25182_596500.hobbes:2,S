Definitely not ! 
The point is that the "tcp write space available" 
wakeup does not get called if SOCK_NOSPACE bit is not set. This was
fine when the wakeup was merely a wakeup (since SOCK_NOSPACE bit 
indicated that someone really cared abt the wakeup). Now after the
introduction of callback'ed wakeups, we might have some work to
do inside the callback even if there is nobody interested in the wakeup
at that point of time. 
In this particular case the ep_poll_callback is not getting called and
hence the socket fd is not getting added to the ready list.
Thanx,
Tomar
