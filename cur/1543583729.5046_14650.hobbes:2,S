I'm not aware of any problems.  It's only really used in one
place at present - when networking interrupt context wants to
acquire a socket's semaphore.  Oh.  That seems to have disappeared.
I've tested it pretty hard on SMP with zillions of printk()s from
interrupt context in parallel with `cat lots_of_stuff'.

That was different.  The parport code was leaving the semaphore in
a downed state when it shouldn't have.
But you're right - it's not well-proven code.  I'll go stare
angrily at it for a while.  Of course, there are about ten
different implementations...
