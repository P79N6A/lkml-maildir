Hi Linus,
Today's linux-next build (powerpc ppc64_defconfig) failed like this:
arch/powerpc/platforms/pasemi/cpufreq.c: In function 'pas_cpufreq_cpu_init':
arch/powerpc/platforms/pasemi/cpufreq.c:216: error: incompatible types in assignment
arch/powerpc/platforms/powermac/cpufreq_64.c: In function 'g5_cpufreq_cpu_init':
arch/powerpc/platforms/powermac/cpufreq_64.c:365: error: incompatible types in assignment
arch/powerpc/platforms/cell/cbe_cpufreq.c: In function 'cbe_cpufreq_cpu_init':
arch/powerpc/platforms/cell/cbe_cpufreq.c:121: error: incompatible types in assignment
Caused by commit 835481d9bcd65720b473db6b38746a74a3964218 ("cpumask:
convert struct cpufreq_policy to cpumask_var_t") which missed updating
all the powerpc (at least) cpufreq drivers.
Reverting that one commit required fixups, so I reverted merge commit
4e9b1c184cadbece3694603de5f880b6e35bd7a7 ("Merge branch 'cpus4096-for-linus'
of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tip/linux-2.6-tip")
instead.
I am hoping that this will be fixed soon and that revert doesn't
propagate more pain through today's linux-next.
This branch was last committed to in the tip tree on Jan 7 (the patch
above was committed on Jan 6) but was never propagated to linux-next
before being merged into your tree yesterday.
