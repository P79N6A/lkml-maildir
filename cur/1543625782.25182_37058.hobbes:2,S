I reported CRC errors, intermittently, on all six IDE disks, each
a master on a separate cable.

I reorganized the cables so that each takes a differnt path from the
mobo to the disk. I still see errors, so far on hda. I will see if
the rate is really reduced.

I do not have spinup problems. Neither does the computer :-)

The new PS should do it then.

OK, I checked, and after a bus reset the disk in error was dropped
from udma5 to udma4. I did not see more errors after that (but the
setup is up for less than one day so far). I plan to push it hard
