Userland suspend is driven by the suspending application which only calls
the kernel to do things it cannot do itself, like freezing (the other)
processes, snapshotting the system etc.  We use the /dev/snapshot
device and the ioctl()s in there, so no sysfs files are needed for that.
It's independent and can coexist with the existing sysfs interface
just fine.
Greetings,
Rafael
