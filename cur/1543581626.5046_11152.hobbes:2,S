Hi Andre !
Any reason other than usual programmer "too many things to remember" for
2.4 lacking the small ide_revalidate_disk() fix we did recently in 2.2 to
keep the blocksize of the device intact ? (Just diff the 2 functions,
it's pretty obvious)
I'd be glad to send Linus a patch, but I beleive he won't accept an ide.c
patch that doesn't originate from you ;)
Regards,
Ben.
