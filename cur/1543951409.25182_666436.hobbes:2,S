> The only bug that code ever caught aside of tons of false positives
It caught bugs when I originally worked on cpa. However that 
had still the revert code and admittedly several were in 
that area (I'm still suspecting at some point you'll have
to readd that -- perhaps it'll be more useful for you then)
However I had originally a longer runtime length too, but later
decreased it when I sent out the patch (since i didn't want 
to submit another "rcu torture" which runs for hours...) 
Perhaps the result was a little too short too, that's possible.

Ok I admit I don't know how to do that effectively for cpa, but perhaps
you do.
