On a laptop you can decide to "trust" the drive to spin up, just
because the benefits outweigh the drawbacks.
The benefit may be: Battery life becomes 8 hours instead of 4. That
might mean that you get 4 hours of extra work done while travelling at
$100 per hour.... 
Just editing source-code using VI, or reading docs can leave your 
disk completely idle for hours at a time. 
Debugging an app, compiling testing, recompiling can leave your disk
idle provided you accept dirty blocks in the buffer cache...
