+test at least a couple of times in a row for confidence.  [This is necessary,
+because some problems only show up on a second attempt at suspending and
+resuming the system.]  Moreover, hibernating in the "reboot" and "shutdown"
+modes causes the PM core to skip some platform-related callbacks which on ACPI
+systems might be necessary to make hibernation work.  Thus, if you machine fails
+to hibernate or resume in the "reboot" mode, you should try the "platform" mode:
 
 # echo platform > /sys/power/disk
 # echo disk > /sys/power/state
 
-or
+which is the default and recommended mode of hibernation.
+
+Unfortunately, the "platform" mode of hibernation does not work on some systems
+with broken BIOSes.  In such cases the "shutdown" mode of hibernation might
+work:
 
 # echo shutdown > /sys/power/disk
 # echo disk > /sys/power/state

+(it is similar to the "reboot" mode, but it requires you to press the power
+button to make the system resume).
+
+If neither "platform" nor "shutdown" hibernation mode works, you will need to
+identify what goes wrong.
+
+a) Test modes of hibernation
+
+To find out why hibernation fails on your system, you can use a special testing
+facility available if the kernel is compiled with CONFIG_PM_DEBUG set.  Then,
+there is the file /sys/power/pm_test that can be used to make the hibernation
+core run in a test mode.  There are 5 test modes available:
+
+freezer
+- test the freezing of processes
+
+devices
+- test the freezing of processes and suspending of devices
 
-a) Test mode of STD
+platform
+- test the freezing of processes, suspending of devices and platform
+  global control methods(*)
 
-To verify if there are any drivers that cause problems you can run the STD
-in the test mode:
+processors
+- test the freezing of processes, suspending of devices, platform
+  global control methods(*) and the disabling of nonboot CPUs
 
-# echo test > /sys/power/disk
+core
+- test the freezing of processes, suspending of devices, platform global
+  control methods(*), the disabling of nonboot CPUs and suspending of
+  platform/system devices
+
+(*) the platform global control methods are only available on ACPI systems
+    and are only tested if the hibernation mode is set to "platform"
+
+To use one of them it is necessary to write the corresponding string to
+/sys/power/pm_test (eg. "devices" to test the freezing of processes and
+suspending devices) and issue the standard hibernation commands.  For example,
+to use the "devices" test mode along with the "platform" mode of hibernation,
+you should do the following:
+
+# echo devices > /sys/power/pm_test
+# echo platform > /sys/power/disk
 # echo disk > /sys/power/state
 
-in which case the system should freeze tasks, suspend devices, disable nonboot
-CPUs (if any), wait for 5 seconds, enable nonboot CPUs, resume devices, thaw
-tasks and return to your command prompt.  If that fails, most likely there is
-a driver that fails to either suspend or resume (in the latter case the system
-may hang or be unstable after the test, so please take that into consideration).
-To find this driver, you can carry out a binary search according to the rules:
+Then, the kernel will try to freeze processes, suspend devices, wait 5 seconds,
+resume devices and thaw processes.  If "platform" is written to
+/sys/power/pm_test , then after suspending devices the kernel will additionally
+invoke the global control methods (eg. ACPI global control methods) used to
+prepare the platform firmware for hibernation.  Next, it will wait 5 seconds and
+invoke the platform (eg. ACPI) global methods used to cancel hibernation etc.
+
+Writing "none" to /sys/power/pm_test causes the kernel to switch to the normal
+hibernation/suspend operations.  Also, when open for reading, /sys/power/pm_test
+contains a space-separated list of all available tests (including "none" that
+represents the normal functionality) in which the current test level is
+indicated by square brackets.
+
+Generally, as you can see, each test level is more "invasive" than the previous
+one and the "core" level tests the hardware and drivers as deeply as possible
+without creating a hibernation image.  Obviously, if the "devices" test fails,
+the "platform" test will fail as well and so on.  Thus, as a rule of thumb, you
+should try the test modes starting from "freezer", through "devices", "platform"
+and "processors" up to "core" (repeat the test on each level a couple of times
+to make sure that any random factors are avoided).
+
+If the "freezer" test fails, there is a task that cannot be frozen (in that case
+it usually is possible to identify the offending task by analysing the output of
+dmesg obtained after the failing test).  Failure at this level usually means
+that there is a problem with the tasks freezer subsystem that should be
+reported.
+
+If the "devices" test fails, most likely there is a driver that cannot suspend
+or resume its device (in the latter case the system may hang or become unstable
+after the test, so please take that into consideration).  To find this driver,
+you can carry out a binary search according to the rules:
