Doesn't sound like a bug in ieee1394. This bus for each is done on the
ieee1394_bus_type, which is registered way ahead of time. Nothing is in
that device list that didn't come from device_register(). Has something
new changed to where I need to prep the device more before passing it to
device_register()?
