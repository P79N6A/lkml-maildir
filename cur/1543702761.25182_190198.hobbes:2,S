Sorry for being a bit late...I was travelling and didn't have the time
to go over the whole thread until now.
Let me clarify what Part II of the DMA-API is about: it's for drivers
who may be required to operate both on hardware that has a coherency
domain and hardware that hasn't.
Its design is primarily to be as efficient as possible on coherency
domain hardware.
I think it can do exactly what you want for the RO case, because it was
tailored for almost precisely this problem (guaranteeing mailbox
reads/writes become coherent).  I think dma_cache_sync() corresponds
almost exactly to the semantics you would require of
pci_sync_coherent().
Of course, it's not the whole solution because even on hardware without
a coherency domain, PIO reads/writes are still coherent.
