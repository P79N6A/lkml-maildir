Printk to the serial console uses polled I/O to get deterministic,
reliable, and -timely- output. If our very next statement (or interrupt)
may lock up the box, we want to be sure our printk has actually been
delivered before that happens.
Kindof a bummer for realtime, but also rather hard to get around.

2000bits @ 115200bps -> 17.4ms

Well, we could have a commandline option that made messages with a
priority below X go out buffered. But it'd be a lousy default from a
debugging perspective.
