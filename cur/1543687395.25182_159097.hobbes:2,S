As far as I know, I have no problems with my 3rd channel on my Epox
8K9A3+ motherboard. I've got a WD 80 Gb disk (8 Mb cache model) on it.
However, I've noticed something else.
As soon as I type 
cat /proc/ide/hpt366
I get hit by the dreaded 'status=0x58 .... hdi interrupt lost' thing.
It tries to reset ide4, but keeps telling 'interrupt lost' and finally I
have to use the reset button. If I never cat /proc/ide/hpt366 I can run
the system for a week at a time, where hdi is part of a raid-0 partition
that contains both /home and my newsspool - so it's used frequently.
Kind regards,
Jurriaan
