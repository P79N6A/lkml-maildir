OK, I agree.

It is a nice idea.

OK, I agree too.

I forgot to do so... thanks!

Sure, this "add" may modify the status flags. It should be fixed.

Why would you like to use "iret"?
I worry about its negative side effects, because the "iret" is only for
interrupt handlers and may have some side effects.
In my honest opinion, this can be fixed by moving eflags to cs field,
putting the return address in eflags and using "ret".
I developed a patch and attach it to this mail.
This patch fixes and cleanups kretprobe-kretprobe-booster by:
          - Not reserving 8 bytes at stack bottom
          - Making trampoline_handler fastcall and calling it directly
          - Not changing the status flags
I'm very happy to be fixed it! Thank you very much for pointing it out!
