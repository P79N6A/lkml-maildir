It looks like kudzu (also known as "the RH hardware hack from h*ll") 
actually messes with "sysctl 1 23", aka "/proc/sys/kernel/printk".
Why it thinks it should mess with it I don't know. I dislike how the 
distributions tend to shut off kernel messages that can tell you when
something is seriously wrong, making the error cases be silent hangs
instead of having some indication of why something went wrong.. I 
wonder if that's what kudzu is doing - shutting the kernel up before
it starts doing things that it should never do.
Anyway, having one
	kudzu: numerical sysctl 1 23 is obsolete.
during bootup seems to be a fairly non-irritating thing, and hopefully the 
kudzu people can just stop doing whatever they are doing.
