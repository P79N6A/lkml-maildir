AX.25 addresses are 7 bytes long at the physical layer, but because they
including routing info up to about 60 bytes long elsewhere. Fortunately
lengths are passed to all but the hw level SIOCSIF/SIOCGIF calls, and
even those can be increased a little without harm as they use the
struct sockaddr - in fact I think 14 bytes would be the limit.
Seems trivial to do in 2.5 and quite doable in 2.4 if you actually have
to worry about this at the SIOCSIFADDR/GIFHWADDR level.
