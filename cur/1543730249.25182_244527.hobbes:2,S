Yup I think I have a regression here, as well. I remember an older
version of ck exhibited this, but the last one for 2.6.7 did work well
(I think even the one for 2.8.6-rc4 was ok), IIRC. In my case, when
doing a (niced) compile in background, some windows react very slow, ie
Mozilla Thunderbird takes ages to switch trough mails or cliking on an
icon in kde to load up konsole takes about 10seconds or more (shoud come
up <1sec normally).
Using 2.8.6.1-ck4
HTH,
Prakash
