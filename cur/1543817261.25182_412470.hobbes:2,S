Up to uids I agree.  Once we hit uids things get very ugly.
And since security modules already seem to touch all of the places
we need to touch to make a UID namespace work I think using security
modules to implement the strange things we need with uid.
To ensure uid isolation we would need a different copy of every other
namespace.  The pid space would need to be completely isolated,
and we couldn't share any filesystem mounts with any other namespace.
This especially includes /proc and sysfs.

Security modules that are stackable call mod_reg_security.
Currently in the current we have: root_plug, seclvl, capability modules
that implement this. selinux currently only supports running
as the global security policy.
Allowing a different administrator to load modules is out of
the question, if we actually care about security.
However it is possible to build the capacity to multiplex 
compiled in or already loaded security modules, and allowed which
security modules are in effect to be controlled by securityfs.
With appropriate care we should be able to allow the container
administrator to use this capability to select which security
policies, and mechanisms they want. 
That is something we probably want to consider anyway as
currently the security modules break the basic rule that
compiling code in should not affect how the kernel operates
by default.
Until we get to that point simply specifying the name of a security
module in the static configuration of a container that the container
creation program can use should be enough.

Agreed.  But if I hand wave and say an upper level security module will
decide when to call it then only the details of that upper level
security module are in question.  The stacked module will likely just
work.
So I guess I am leaning towards a security namespace implemented with
an appropriate security module.
