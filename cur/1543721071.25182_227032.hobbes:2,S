The box has just one processor (Duron, in case it's relevant). BTW, I'm  
a bit at a loss how to reproduce the problem. Trouble is, it appears  
quite arbitrarily. The box has been running about 26hrs now without a  
reboot. (OK, there wasn't much activity today except handling mails.) I  
could unload the fcdsl module, which would cut me off the net. If  
necessary, I could even do this for a day or two -- but what if that  
error didn't occur during that time? As I'm not sure what triggered it  
in the first place, IMHO nothing could be deduced with certainty from  
the error not occuring. There'd only be definite information if it  
_did_ happen again. So, what do you suggest? (Sorry if that sounds  
obnoxious, but I'm really a bit confused about this stuff...)
Best regards,
Andreas
