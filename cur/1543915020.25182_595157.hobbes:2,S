Sorry for the late reply.
First, thanks for your patch.  Although I have also a similar patch
pending on my tree, but it wasn't applied, because I'd like to mark
these functions/data rather as __devinit*.  And, sadly, init and const
don't like with each other.  So, my plan is to apply __devinit but
without const.
But, please don't hurry up to mark everything init yet now.  I've been
working on the dynamic codec parser on user-space and this would
involve with some functions that are now apparently init functions.
Since this isn't a critical issue, let's postpone it as a post-2.6.24
stuff.
thanks,
Takashi
