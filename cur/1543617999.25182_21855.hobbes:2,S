That kinda defeats the entire purpose of low-latency patches, doesn't it?
I'm not entirely certain what Alan's smoking if he's raising the straw man 
argument of a two second delay dropping 300 packets and causing connections 
to abort (my sister's on DSL, 5 second dropouts every time the phone rings, 
but connections continue just fine.  Wouldn't want to play quake under those 
circumstances, but would I really have the ~200 CPU-hog background threads 
while playing quake as per Alan's example, and even then the argument is just 
that either the network driver or the network card is bad...)
Still not as bad an example as Aunt Tillie, I'll grant you...
