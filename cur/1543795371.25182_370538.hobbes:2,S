Just a bit of practical experience: I use mmap() to write data a LOT,
because msync(MS_ASYNC) is the most portable way to do an async write.
There are two applications.  First, helping the OS not fill up with
dirty pages.  It's basically a way of saying "this page is not going to
be dirtied again for a long time".
Secondly, to reduce the latency of synchronous writes.  If I need to
log operations durably, it helps to
1) fill the log pages, using MS_ASYNC as soon as the page is full
2) when committing a batch, use MS_SYNC to force data to disk
3) report batch successfully committed to stable storage
The aio_ routines are less widely supported some implementations have
very high overhead.  They would allow me to keep working while a commit
is in progress, but the above is simple and reduces the burstiness of
I/O considerably.
