mount by label does part of the job, until you decide to use dd(1) to copy
a disk.  At which point you have, AFAICS, no way tell which copy will get
mounted.

I prefer to ssh to another box and use mutt.  Seriously, I've made a mistake
of reading imapd source and that was enough to decide that I'm _not_ touching
uw-<anything> and that protocol in general unless I really have no other
options.  So far I've managed to avoid that...

Same here.  There are things about trn command set I'd prefer to see changed,
but it's better than other newsreaders I've seen...
