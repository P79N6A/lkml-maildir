Hi,
I experience the same speedstep problem on my HP nc6320 (CoreDuo T2400) 
since yesterday's BIOS update (F06 to F08).
According to the release notes this BIOS update should introduce support 
for the new CPU's (Core2 "Merom" I suppose).
I did verify both kernels 2.6.16 and 2.6.17 (both vanilla), there is 
_no_ difference, both have the same speedstep problem.
I did look through the 2.6.17 logs, before and after the bios update and
diff showed the following differences:
The BIOS v F06 (speedstep was OK):
kernel: ACPI: RSDP (v000 HP                                    ) @

0x00000000
The BIOS v F08 (no speedstep anymore):
kernel: ACPI: RSDP (v002 HP                                    ) @ 
0x000f7f00

0x3f7e5684
kernel: ACPI: MADT (v001 HP     30AA     0x00000001 HP   0x00000001) @ 
0x3f7e5808

So, i suppose it has something to do with a CpuPm SSDT section which is 
now missing (or maybe present in a different form?).
As a consequence, with BIOS v. F06 i get the following messages:
kernel: ACPI: CPU0 (power states: C1[C1] C2[C2])
kernel: ACPI: Processor [CPU0] (supports 8 throttling states)
kernel: ACPI: CPU1 (power states: C1[C1] C2[C2])
kernel: ACPI: Processor [CPU1] (supports 8 throttling states)
and with BIOS v. F08 just this:
kernel: ACPI: Processor [CPU0] (supports 8 throttling states)
kernel: ACPI: Processor [CPU1] (supports 8 throttling states)
If any further info would help, I have the full ACPI dump from the BIOS 
F04 (which was OK and had that CpuPm SSDT table too) and could create the 
dump for the BIOS v F08 (which broke the speedstep).
But as it looks, I suspect it is an HP issue and probably has nothing to 
do with linux kernel.
