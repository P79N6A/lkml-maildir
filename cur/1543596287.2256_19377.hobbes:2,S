Obvious question - you call kmalloc with that lock held - that can sleep
as it is GFP_KERNEL so other threads can run and make acpi calls ..
I assume the other threads block on the acpi lock, and the kmalloc eventually
returns.

Microsoft helpdesk engineers I know (contrary to assumptions from some quarters
there is a lot of respect between some of the MS and linux folks for each others
work)

Well actually the license on the intel bios says not. Of course the license
is invalid here but nevertheless..

No. There are people more paranoid than I care to consider sane. They have
lots of money. There are also a bunch of greenpeace people who today walked
straight into a US top secret base in the UK singing the mission impossible
theme tune .. which did you doubt ?
[Come to think of it which do you find the more improbable ..]
