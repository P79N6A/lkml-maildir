killing getty is a very very lucky scenario indeed. the way I read it
was that agetty can hardly be a mem eater, and in turn the same way
agetty was killed, it could have been ssh or X to be killed. That's
true, but the same issues on the desktop will happen if you have no swap
if you enable the old oom killer, the vm will go nuts even if you don't
run oom, and there will be all other sort of troubles mentioned a few
times already.
