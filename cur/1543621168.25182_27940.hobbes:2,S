Subject: [patch] tmpfs: incr. link-count on directory rename

Hi Christoph, hi all! 
When I move a directory into another on a tmpfs filesystem, the
link-count of the new parent directory isn't getting incremented. 
(which leads to find getting hickup, which eg. lets dpkg produce a
"bzip2" binary package without binaries, generally not a nice thing) 
test: 
isax@home:/tmp/test$ mkdir t1 
isax@home:/tmp/test$ mkdir t2 
isax@home:/tmp/test$ mv t2 t1 
isax@home:/tmp/test$ ls -lRa

drwxrwxrwt   13 root     root            0 Feb 13 23:04 ..

./t1/t2:

the link count of "t1", "t1/." and "t1/t2/.." should be "3", not "2". 
The following patch seems to work fine for me and is tested on my
machine running debian's 2.4.17-1 and user-mode-linux 2.5.1-1. 
This is my first patch to the kernel, so I suppose there is a really
huge mistake in my patch I don't see now...
