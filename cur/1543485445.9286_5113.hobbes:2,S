Thats a _very_ bad idea IMHO. Some of the options may not have made it
into arch/<foo>/defconfig and some of these new options you definately
don't want, some of them may even break things for you badly or maybe
hoas your filesystem (ie. if say we had a new experimental option for
ext2). A lot of people tend to just accept options blindly and setting
everything to yes is a bad idea.
