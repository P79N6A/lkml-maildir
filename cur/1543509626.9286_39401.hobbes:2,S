I am running a dual 500 Mhz server from dell with a raid card
from DPT (SmartRaid V).
This machine is basically a NFS server running kernel 2.2.12 + patch
for the buffer leak. The distribution is Redhat 6.0 with latest rpms.
Right now, this machine won't stay up more than 3 days. I get on
the console an oops, but it does no appear in
my /var/adm/messages.
This is really bad because I cannot track what is happening.
Both syslog and klog are running :
root       409     1  0 17:18 ?        00:00:00 syslogd -m 0
root       420     1  0 17:18 ?        00:00:00 klogd
I have even created a /var/log/kernel which is supposed to
receive all kernel messages (kernel.* in the syslog.conf).
Any idea why I cannot catch these oops in a file ?
Thanks in advance for your help. Didier.
