The patch is buggy for non headactive devices like SCSI and also for IDE
while the queue is plugged.
Assume the queue looks like this (it's scsi or IDE plugged):
	HEAD A
HEAD is the &q->queue_head, A is a requests in the queue (not under processing
in the IDE case).
A runtime trace would look like this:
	head = HEAD
	real_head = HEAD
	last = A
	insert_after = A
	entry = A
	tmp1 = A
	tmp2 = A
	entry = HEAD
	tmp1 = HEAD
	read tmp1 -> you're reading random kernel memory here
While the queue is plugged or with things like SCSI your logic change won't
work because in such case if your request is lower the lowest in the queue, you
can put it at the head of the queue and you have no way to know where your
"tmp1" was placed so you can't make any assumption (that's why the current code
makes sense).
But I had an idea to generalize the algorithm so that we could optimize
SCSI as well and also IDE in the plugged case: nobody forbid us to remeber
the last position of the drive in the request_queue_t to still be able to
know your "tmp1" that actually we don't know about.
If nobody does that before me I will try this "remeber last position of the
head" idea in my blkdev tree (there are many other pending elevator fixes in
it) as soon as I finished with 2.2.18pre9aa1 LFS nfsv3 and as soon as I finish
the fix for the spinlocks (this spinlock "memory" thing got starved over and
over again unfortunately, at least it's not an urgent fix :).
Thanks for your comments.
