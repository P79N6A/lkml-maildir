OOPs mistake from my side.It must be the ohci driver
instead of the uhci..(just got confused).
"all apologies"

When i plug the device into the machine the kernel
crashes.Thinking it might be something with the
hotplug i disabled it (mv /sbin/hotplug
/sbin/hotplug.old) and inserted the modules one by
one.When i insert the st module the kernel crashes.
When i just leave everything to work magically this is
what happens(same message as when  insert the module)
 EFLAGS: 00010293
lh35s: EIP is at dl_done_list [usb-ohci] 0X76
(2.4.18-3SMP)

<0>Kernel panic: Aiee, killing interupt handler!
I looked through the /var/log/messages but no luck for
any errors.
