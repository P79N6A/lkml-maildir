This is true.  That was something I forgot to mention.  I have looked
at that as well, and it strikes me as even more of a hack than the
solutions I mentioned: it is yet another external shell process for
each invocation of Rules.make (ie each directory).  As I said before,
though, one man's hack is another man's clean design, so whatever.
Your function is rather long; try this one instead (untested):
  remove_duplicates () {
    str='';
    for i; do
      case "$str " in *" $i "*) ;; *) str="$str $i" ;; esac
    done
    echo "$str"
  }
I still think anything outside the makefiles that's needed to organize
the build process is a hack.  That includes scripts/pathdown.sh (yes, I
do have a scheme to get rid of it) and 2.2.18 scripts/kwhich (yes, I
did propose a working alternative).  It doesn't include scripts/mkdep.c
(which must do a lot of work as efficiently as possible),
scripts/Configure et al (which are really standalone programs), or
scripts/split-include.c (which is really a continuation of Configure).
