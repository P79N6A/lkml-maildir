But that will only change the rate at which processes are killed,
not the fact that they are killed in the first place, right ?
As I said I've got plenty memory free ... perhaps I need to tune
/proc/sys/vm because I've got so much streaming I/O ? Possibly,
there are too many dirty pages so cleaning them out faster might
help (and let pflushd do it instead of my single-threaded app)
# cd /proc/sys/vm
# echo 200 > dirty_writeback_centisecs
# echo 60 > dirty_ratio
# echo 500 > dirty_expire_centisecs
I'll let it run like this for a while first.
If this helps, perhaps it means that the VM doesn't write out
dirty pages fast enough when low on memory ?
Mike.
