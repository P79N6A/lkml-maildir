What would those devices be?  Have you looked at how, say, 802.15.4
wireless stacks would need to work?  I'm thinking those will be
interesting for some embedded Linux folk.  There are probably at least
half a dozen such Zigbee-capable radio chips that hook up through SPI,
and they're not always hooked up to 8-bit CPUs!
By the way, I'd say the framework already chains transfers, and what
you're proposing is that drivers be able to do so more flexibly.

Well, that's the guts of the good example I was hoping you would share.
I'll be posting a refresh of this code soonish; maybe you can provide 
a complete patch, changing all the code over to use list-not-array?
My own reasons for liking the notion of spi_transfer list membership
are to enable such transfer shuffling within the controller drivers,
more than at the spi_device driver level.  If both layers will see some
benefits, then it's likely a good change.  ;)
