Placing the shared memory segments last and limiting by ulimit -c
is one of the solutions.  But there is no guarantee that the memory
segments other than anonymous shared memory are always dumped.
So your idea cannot alternate my suggesting feature.
But if your idea has a merit which my idea doesn't have, I try to
consider coexistence of both idea.

Indeed.  However, some people don't want to dump anonymous shared memory
at all.  Taking into account this requirement, I don't guarantee that.
But this feature allows per-process setting.  So if you want to dump
the shared memory at least once, you can manage to do that in userland.
