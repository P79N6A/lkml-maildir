How about if it was an error to have a "depends" and a "select" for
the same config option? That would simplify the config graph - maybe
it would avoid the problems that you'd seen before?
Alternatively, for options that aren't user-selectable, but are only
triggered by the user selecting a component that requires them (e.g.
selecting the memory controller requires containers) maybe they should
be taken out of Kconfig and just made into Makefile-derived variables?
