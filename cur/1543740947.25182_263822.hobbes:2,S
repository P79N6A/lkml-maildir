When you (Linus) think a release is ready to be released, call it
-rc1. If you did your job correctly, you can just sit and wait
for a few days and release the -rc1 as a new kernel.
In the real world though, some bugs may crop up, so you'd be
forced to release a rc2. Which in turn may be released unchanged
as the final kernel.
Releases prior to a release candidate can be called whatever you
like. I'd choose -preX ;-)
