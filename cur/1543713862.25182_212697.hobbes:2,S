  The soft page fault is a problem if the device is going to write data 
into the buffer and then notify the user that the buffer now contains 
valid data. If the soft page fault occurs before the device has written
to the page list, once the user is notified of the write and reads the 
buffer, it will no longer be the same pages as the ones to which the 
device wrote. Is setting VM_LOCKED the only way to prevent the soft
page fault and this issue?
