How?
If you bisect, you test a commit. If the commit is bad, you assume *all* 
commits before that as bad. If it is good, you assume *all* commits after 
that as good.
Now, if you have a 2-dimensional surface, you don't have a *point*, but 
typically a *line* separating good from bad.
Further, the comparison with 2 dimensions is particularly bad. You 
*have* partially linear development lines, it got *nothing* to do with 
an area. The commits still make up a *list*, and it depends how you 
*order* that list for bisect. (And don't tell me they are not ordered: 
they are.)
If you order the commits by date, you don't get anything meaningful point 
before which it is bad, and after which it is good.
So, how is bisect supposed to work if you don't have one straight 
development line from bad to good?
Ciao,
Dscho
