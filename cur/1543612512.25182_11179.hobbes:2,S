In Rik's VM I had a problem with use-once when Bonnie was doing
rewrite.  It's used-twice data became too hard to get rid of at
the aging volume we were doing, leading to an inactive shortage
and unwanted swapping.  The active list grew until ~all of ram
was on the active list.  I 'fixed' it here by keeping the dirty
list very strictly ordered (lengthened it too) and requiring more
than two accesses before promoting to active.
I have not seen this behavior in the new VM yet.
