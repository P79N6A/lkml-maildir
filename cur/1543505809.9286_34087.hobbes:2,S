Yes, you need a:
	echo 40 500 64 256 0 >/proc/sys/vm/bdflush
to disable kupdate. Then it will go to sleep.
To reenable kupdate you need to:
	echo 40 500 64 256 500 >/proc/sys/vm/bdflush
and _then_ send it a SIGCONT. (note on Alpha the second 500 has to be
close to 5000 since HZ is 1024 there)
That was intentional to make sure nobody is going to STOP kupdate by
mistake. If you think it's better to allow kupdate to be stopped simply
via a SIGSTOP I can change the code.
