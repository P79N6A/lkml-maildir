  Just a quick curiosity, anyone know of an already working project for an
  application similar to srcmstr for AIX?  i.e.  the ability to handle
  start/stop/respawn of a process/group of process from init automaticly.
  i.e. be able to automaticly restart a process from init even if the process
  fork/exec's?  restarting a group of processes, i.e. httpd spawns multiple
  servers, beeing able to use a single unified program to restart all of them.
  I am familiar with apachectrl, but I was hoping to be able to utilize a
  central point application.
  Beeing able to startsrc httpd via init and then having a srcmstr keep track
  of all of the children generated by that execution, being able to send
  signals to all children of that execution, ect..ect..
