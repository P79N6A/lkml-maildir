This message is just a warning. If your scanner does not support
synchronous data transfers, then it is ok. You may want to check the doc
of the device on this point.

This is the way the driver signals data overrun. Btw, I never used xsane.
If this tool has some trace mode that tells what SCSI commands are sent to
the device, this would help to get such traces.

At least, try to catch the SCSI commands that are sent to the device, and
report them.
