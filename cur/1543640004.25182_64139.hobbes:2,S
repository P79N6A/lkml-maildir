Not really.  With the quality of existing userland (Linux, Solaris, *BSD,
NT, etc.) _anything_ more complex than "I'm the only one who can create
or remove objects here" is a big, gaping hole.  Which makes any theoretical
benefits (if any) of ACL-based schemes moot.  Same (to slightly less extent)
applies to regular files.
In other words, if you need something more complex than usual - you are
screwed on the userland side, regardless of the kernel behaviour.
