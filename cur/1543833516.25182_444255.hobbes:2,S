While we are thinking about this I have a stupid question.
Currently if a memory mapped region does not fall in a standard PCI
bar we insist it must be E820 reserved.  However if we E820 reserve
the memory of a standard pci bar it becomes unusable.
Is this really the behavior that we intend?
It gets confusing that E820 reserved gets double duty as memory
the BIOS is using and MMIO space that is mapped by a non-standard bar.
