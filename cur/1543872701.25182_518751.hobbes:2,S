Userspace has the usually same definition.

It is different that "0" as such has the type "int". But this int is
automatically promoted to a "0 pointer".

Yes, because it is immediately clear that a pointer is (or should be)
there (and not an int).
And the same holds for userspace since this is a pure C question.
