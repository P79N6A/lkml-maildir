Hi,
Documentation/accounting/delay-accounting.txt says that the
getdelays program has a "-c cmd" argument, but that option
does not seem to exist in Documentation/account/getdelays.c.
Do you have an updated version of getdelays.c?
If not, please correct that documentation.
Is getdelays.c the best available example of a program
using the taskstats netlink interface?
Thanks,
