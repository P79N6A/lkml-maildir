The value cannot change because of that.  There only is a small window inside
unuse_mm() (or use_mm()) in which the value may be wrong.  Namely:
static void unuse_mm(struct mm_struct *mm)
{
	struct task_struct *tsk = current;
	task_lock(tsk);
	tsk->flags &= ~PF_BORROWED_MM;
---
--- If is_user_space() without the task_lock() is called right here, it will
--- return 'true', although it should return 'false'.
---
	tsk->mm = NULL;
	/* active_mm is still 'mm' */
	enter_lazy_tlb(mm, tsk);
	task_unlock(tsk);
}
IOW, quoting Andrew, "is_user_space() requires that the state of p->mm and
p->flags be consistent".

No, it is not meaningless.
