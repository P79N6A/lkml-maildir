Though I'm not a kernel developer let me allow to comment this based on
my experiences as well.

What kind of instability have you got? I haven't had any instability since
at least a year or so, or if there was it was some kind of hardware fault.
In fact, many machines (like an Armada E500 notebook and some servers as well)
seems to be stable which was NOT in case of 2.4 kernels! So for our experience
at our workplace, 2.6 seems to be much more usable than 2.4.x kernels (ok,
it may be caused by "newer" hardwares, on quite old machines I can't show
major difference in stability between 2.4 and 2.6)

It was marked as obsoleted for some time ... I guess marking something
'osboleted' means that _NO_ new project should depends on it, and also
existing projects should be ported to the newer solutions. The purpose of
this process is to leave enough time for developers to react. I can't see
any problem here. You would be right if devfs would have been removed some
day without any notice before.

Ah, I see your point. But is it really a BIG problem? I mean please mention
some *real* issue/story confirm your opinion. Sure, you can find, but also
compare it with the advantages of new development model, since there is nothing
in the world which is only have advantages neither something which only has
disadvantages ... The would is not black or white, but a great spectrum of
gray shades.

sysfs should not used by an average application, I guess, so it's not a major
point
