Note that I am NOT talking about a graphics library. This has NO
BUSINESS doing any kind of rendering. It's only the userland interface
to the underlying kernel drivers as far as mode switching & geometry
is concerned. That's _ALL_. In the same  was as libGL is the userland
interface to DRI, or iptables the userlnad interface to netfilter,
etc...

I agree. The HW access is done in kernel space. That's even true for
acceleration actually. You are mixing things. What I'm taking about
is exactly that: The userland library gets the various EDID & other
probing informations coming from the kernel drivers. It does the various
policy decisions on mode setting, it provides the API for userland to
deal with mode setting & monitor placement (what I call geometry)
and saving/restoring of configurations. The actual banging of the mode
to the HW is done by the kernel driver though. (The card specific back
end of the library probably builds either a mode description or a
register list and pass that to the kernel driver).

I have been using multi head systems for years and I've seen how good
it can be, but also a bunch of the pitfalls when trying to design a
driver for it. If it was that easy, we would have had the right support
in fbdev for ages. We don't.
