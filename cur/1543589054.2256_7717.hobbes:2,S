I'm running 2.4.2ac23 (can't run 2.4.3, messes up my quota system)
glibc 2.1.3, intel providence PR440FX mobo, intel etherexpress 100B
onboard, RAM is 128MBx3.
Started getting the following errors:
VM: bad swap entry 00002000
Unused swap offset entry in swap_dup 00002000
memory.c:84: bad pmd 00002000.
got multiples of all of the above.
also got a bunch of eth0: Transmit timed out: status f048  0000 at
387774/387804 command 0001a000.
and i also got some programs segfaulting.
Swap is 128MB. "free" does not show system using any swap.
Thanx,
-Tony
