I agree with Stephen here, if my cache page is older than my mmaped vi
page, I want to unmap first the vi page.

Yes, but you have to find a _magic_ number for knowing when to free
for the maped pages/cache pages.  That number comes for free with the
inactive list implementation and is based in the actual workload,
i.e. we don't need to guess.
Later, Juan.
