No.  GPL software may not be integrated with non-GPL-compatible software.
That's a significant difference, when the no-ads BSD licence and the MIT
licence are both GPL compatible.

It's distributed under the GPL with one extra restriction.  Which means
that it's not under the GPL at all.  The issue is not that selling GPL
exceptions is bad.  It's that Hans doesn't not believe that the GPL offers
his enough protection, because it doesn't prevent anybody from linking it
with, for example, a proprietary fork of FreeBSD (the code of which /is/
GPL compatible).
The licence doesn't stop anybody from using it in GPL-compatible userspace
works either.  What if someone make a database or news server in userspace
from the code..
Matthew.
