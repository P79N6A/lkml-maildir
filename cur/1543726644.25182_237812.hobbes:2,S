If you want it to work that way, you have the have a pass-through filter
in the kernel knowing what commands are out there (including vendor
specific ones). That's just too ugly and not really doable or
maintainable, sorry.
If you have access to issue ioctls to the device, you have access to
send it arbitrary commands - period.
