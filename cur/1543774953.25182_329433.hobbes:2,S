Hi David,
They are against 2.6.12-git4 plus a later revision of the PageRemoval
patchset I posted to linux-mm earlier, which is needed to make page
refcounting consistent.
I have a couple of updates and fixes for both sets of patches, so I
can send you a rollup of the current patches against a current -git
kernel privately if you would like.
Thanks,
Nick
