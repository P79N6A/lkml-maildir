That identity makes no sense anyway.  Not every "phys" address has a
corresponding "virt" address.  In my opinion, phys_to_virt should be
removed, and the few drivers that use it changed to work properly.

No, this is wrong.  ioremap() does _not_ return a "virt" address, though
it does return a virtual address.  Calling virt_to_phys() on the return
value of ioremap() does _not_ get you the physical address.
Read the examples in `documentation/IO-mapping.txt'.  Logically,
ioremap() and "phys" addresses share the same space: the space of
addresses that can be passed to readb/writeb et al.
"virt" addresses refer to virtual addresses in the direct-mapped kernel
image, but not vmalloc() or ioremap() addresses.  Beware.
These concepts need some serious cleaning up, and it's a 2.3 thing.
