That might be a concern once glibc startup can occur with less than a few 
dozen calls to grope through the local files. ;-)  Hmmm, it would be possible 
to make the vsyscall page mapped by default and leave the global bit enabled 
until UML forcibly unmapped it (and then clear the global bit and do a global 
invalidate).  Would that be acceptible?
