I assume that the onboard SCSI is Adaptec?  If so, I strongly suggest that
you roll back (at least the SCSI driver) to 2.0.32.  Numerous people
(including myself) have reported system locks with the 2.0.36 and higher
AIC7xxx driver.
The hangs seem to happen when you do disk-to-disk operations.  They also
tend to happen more often on slower machines.  On my dual P5-133, everytime
I copy a file that is larger the ~1MB from one drive to another the system
hangs.  People with faster CPUs usually say that the hangs are more
intermittent.
