Ah, well I just added that based on the end of this boot message:

If I don't add it hdparm -t /dev/hda reports:
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in 16.46 seconds =  3.89 MB/sec
Then if I do hdparm -d1 -X66 /dev/hda I get:
/dev/hda:
 setting using_dma to 1 (on)
 setting xfermode to 66 (UltraDMA mode2)
 using_dma    =  1 (on)
[root@nano /root]# hdparm -t /dev/hda
/dev/hda:
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  4.04 seconds = 15.84 MB/sec
Now if I add it via append, reboot and do hdparm -t I get:
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  3.70 seconds = 17.30 MB/sec
This last difference is consistently better. Weird.
All your other bets were right too.
Thanks Wayne,
Mike
