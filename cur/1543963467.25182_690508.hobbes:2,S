I have a bit of a mystery going on here.

Some architectures (including x86) do not implement TIF_RESTORE_SIGMASK.
Ah, you must have prepared the patches against something prehistoric like
2.6.25.  Please prefer to prepare 2.6.x patches against the 2.6.x tree, not
the 2.6.x-1 tree?
Whatever you're trying to do here, we'll need to find a non-arch-specific
way of doing it.
