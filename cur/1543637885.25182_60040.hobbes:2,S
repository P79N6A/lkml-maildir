I got the following line a couple times over 2 days in /var/log/messages
on one of my servers. The machine preforms perfectly and I am having a
hard time figuring out what happened and if I should do anything on this
machine to prevent/fix problems. 
 Jul 28 10:22:36 skip sshd[14649]: error: select: Bad file descriptor
Any tips where to go from here?
Thanks
Matt
