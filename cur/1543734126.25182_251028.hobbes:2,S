Ok that makes sense. So we need the same kind of ordering rules about
device->close() as we now enforce with ldisc->close(). That suggests we
simply need to call ldisc->close before device->close. I think we can
now do that safely as the device won't deliver data to a closed ldisc.
Will look into it
