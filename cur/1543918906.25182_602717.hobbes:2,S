actually, the pure marker overhead seems to be a regression:

why isnt the marker near zero-cost as it should be? (as long as they are 
enabled but are not in actual use) 2% increase is _ALOT_. That's the 
whole point of good probes: they do not slow down the normal kernel.
_Worst case_ it should be at most a few instructions overhead but that 
does not explain the ~2% wall-clock time regression you measured here.
So there's something wrong going on - either markers have unacceptably 
high cost, or the measurement is not valid.
