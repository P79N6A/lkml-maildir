	As Linus hasn't put it into i386 (nor Alpha), he has
	some good reason.  Ask him for guidance.
	Mainly I think we should NEVER use slow 64/* division routines
	in fast paths.
	Case of ADFS (and Apple HFS, and quite a many others) is that
	they don't support file sizes exceeding 32 bits, do they ?
	In such environments, VFS  i_size  (and loff_t *ppos) are
	extra large for what is needed, and before doing block size
	divisions, you can safely cast the value to (long).
	As an end-result you will get your system free of need for
	libgcc.a, and possible dangers lurking in it.
