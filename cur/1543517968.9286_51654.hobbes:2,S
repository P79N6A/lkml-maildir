The technical issues for constructing a passably efficient interface are
not exactly the hard bit providing you throw away the inline functions.
The ability to run those drivers in user space so that they can be maintained 
is the biggest one of all, and one people who haven't spent years fighting 
binary vendors continue to ignore
If you want 
"Hi I've got a problem Im using the foo sound card on my PC"
"What PC"
"Its a Dell"
"Phone Dell, our card is fine it must be them"
"Hi Dell my sound card wont work"
"Did we ship it"
"No"
"Phone the vendor"
<click>
Then go ahead. Some of us got bored of that game, and the "its not supported
any more" game, and the "permanently engaged" support line trick. 
Now with source you can go to anyone and say "I've got this problem" and
they can look at all the code and say "I'll fix it for $n". If you want to
throw that freedom away then have fun. 
Solve the maintenance problem.....
