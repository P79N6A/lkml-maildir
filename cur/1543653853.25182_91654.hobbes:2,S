Thanks Bill for your comments.

Don't really need a list_head kind of thing for always inorder complete
traversal. list_head (slightly) adds fat in data structures as well as
insertaion/removal. Please le me know if anything that prohibits the use of
page_private field for internal use.

This if condition will be removed.  It does not serve any purpose.  As there
is no way to release_key without a valid key.

It is not mandatory that user app calls free_pages.  Or even in case of app
aborts this call will not be made.  The internal structures are always
released during the exit (with last ref count) along with free of underlying
physical pages.
