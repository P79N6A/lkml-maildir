So should this part of Hugh's code:
                        /*
                         * Optimization: gather nearby vmas into one call down
                         */
                        while (next && next->vm_start <= vma->vm_end + PMD_SIZE
                        && !is_hugepage_only_range(next->vm_start, HPAGE_SIZE)){
                                vma = next;
                                next = vma->vm_next;
                        }
                        free_pgd_range(tlb, addr, vma->vm_end,
                                floor, next? next->vm_start: ceiling);
 
be changed to use pgd_addr_end() to gather up all the vma that
are mapped by a single pgd instead of just spanning out the next
PMD_SIZE?
On ia64 we can have a vma big enough to require more than one pgd, but
in the case that we span, we won't cross the problematic pgd boundaries
where the holes in the address space are lurking.
