BTW, I did an analysis of asm-sparc64/tlb.h and it needs two
MM layer structure definitions or forward declarations related
to pages:
1) struct page.  But it just declares pointers, it never
   dereferences a struct page.
2) free_pages_and_swap_cache().
Both should be handled by the linux/swap.h include, linux/swap.h
makes use of "struct page" pointers in declarations and it provides
the extern for free_pages_and_swap_cache().
So why does include/asm-sparc64/tlb.h need to include linux/pagemap.h?
This would be easy to figure out if you had provided the build error
messages that prompted this change from the beginning.
Perhaps you have a local change of some kind that creates this
requirement?  Or did you see "free_pages_and_swap_cache()" and
think that function is declared in linux/pagemap.h instead of
it's true location which is linux/swap.h?
Thank you.
