Thank you for the response.

Really? I cannot find many lock_kernel calls in 
USB directory and those, which I can find, 
don't appear to protect usb_serial_disconnect
and serial_close from being called at the same time.
May be the protection is at a higher level? 
Personally I don't beleive it.
If you know how this thing is supposed to work,
please, tell me.
Thank you
John
