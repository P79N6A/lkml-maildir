This really is an excellent opportunity for git-bisect, as you are 
trivially and immediately able to reproduce the problem. There are not 
that many patches between rc2 and rc3, so it would require only a few 
reboots to identify offending patch, and git-bisect is really trivial to 
use - see the manpage for the example on the process of bisecting.
