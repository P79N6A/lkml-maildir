Haven't we kind of agreed to use sysfs for things like this? A few years
too late to be raising objections now ;)
One problem I have with sysfs is that it (the directory structure, rather
than the sysfs code itself) really needs to be policed and maintained
by a central and coherent place/person with taste. Otherwise people put
their own random crap with their own random naming schemes and becomes
a crazy mess.
softirqs are not hardware but purely kernel subsystem construct, as such
they probably go under /sys/kernel/. People unfortunately have already
added random crap to the /sys/kernel/ root directory, but future additions
really should go into a good subdirectory structure (putting it into the
root directory is equivalent to ditching all subdirectories from /proc/sys/).
/sys/kernel/softirq/*, I suggest.
