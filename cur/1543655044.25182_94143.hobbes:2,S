Because with kmalloc, you have to be aware of platform implementations.  Most 
notably that cache flush/invalidate instructions only operate at the level of 
certain block of memory (called the cache line width).  If kmalloc returns 
less than a cache line width you have the potential for severe cockups because 
of the possibility of interfering cache operations on adjacent kmalloc regions 
that share the same cache line.
the dma_alloc... function guarantees to avoid this for you by passing the 
allocation to the platform layer which knows the cache characteristics and 
requirements for the machine (and dma controller) you're using.
