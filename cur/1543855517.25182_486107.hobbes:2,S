It looks promising, however, I need to reserve a physical address area 
that is well known (so that the code running on the other processor 
knows where in PCI memory to write to). It appears that 
dma_alloc_coherent returns the address that it allocated. Instead I need 
something where I can tell it what physical address and range I want to use.
