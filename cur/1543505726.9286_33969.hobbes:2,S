I don't really look after this stuff anymore,
but one should be exceptionally careful when fiddling
with the interrupt code in the IDE stuff.
The driver is currently multi-CPU, multi-IRQ, and multi-thread
capable & safe, and "If it ain't broke, don't fix it" applies here,
especially at such a late hour in the development cycle.
I suspect I had a darned good reason for the seemingly "extra" __cli()
at the time, but I'm not looking too close at it anymore.  Taking it out
will likely break something.. and when the IDE breaks, it could destroy
filesystems..
