I think you're right that lib/Kconfig would not be the right place, but
I don't think there is a debug Kconfig.  I tried keeping the Kconfig
additions w/ CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK.  The other option is to make a debug
Kconfig, but every arch seems pretty different in what they have for
their debug section.

You're right, I'll take this out.

I think this would give us some extra info, but ->module, ->owner, and
->oline is only used for !SMP.  I could add that in for all the arch's
spinlock_t in their asm/spinlock.h.  I'm not sure how well that would be
received to increase the size of everyones spinlock_t even though it
would only be when CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK is on.
Thanks,
