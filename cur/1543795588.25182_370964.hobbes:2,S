The netconsole patch should let you send it over a network interface,
but I've not used it much so I won't be able to help. kmsgdump will
let you write it on a floppy disk, but I bet that you don't have any
if you don't have any serial nor parallel ports.
VMWare may help if you are mainly trying to debug a kernel and not
using it for production.

Willy
