Unicode map is not reset on the font load.
The problem is that some things are reset on terminal (console) reset and
some aren't. This makes it quite a difficult to use nonstandard fonts
with nonstandard codepages on the console. Font is saved and unimap is
reset => the next one who logs in gets garbage.
