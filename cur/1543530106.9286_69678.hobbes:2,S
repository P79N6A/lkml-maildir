Arjen van de Ven told me to look in the low-level sound driver section
for MSP3400, so I replaced my "fix" by a comment that tells to look this
up in the proper section.
I found a bug in make xconfig not affecting make menuconfig, which see
in a separate mail on linux-kernel.

re-attached for convenience
New: 
3) patch to Configure.help which documents CONFIG_VIDEO_MSP3400. I hope
   this documentation is sufficient
