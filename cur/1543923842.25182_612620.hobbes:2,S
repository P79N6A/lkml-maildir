On the other hand, these particular header files are of interest to arch
maintainers.
If there are variances between CPUs that mandate different sets of registers
or different usage protocols for equivalent modules, then you will end up with
something you'll object to.
Anyway, I've discussed this with MEI, and they're willing for some flattening
to take place.  The problem is how much?  I could just move all the
cpu-am33v2/ files into the dir above, but what happens if an incompatible CPU
core is introduced?

It's an awkward situation, yes, but not one most people will be concerned
with.  There needs to be some way to multiplex alternate register sets.  The
main ways of doing that are:
 (1) #include hell
 (2) #ifdef hell
 (3) Both
Which do you prefer?
Besides, you should use emacs tags:-)
However, I'll concede that the various versions of AM33 processor should
perhaps be represented by the same CPU subdirectory (cpu-am33), using #ifdef
to add extra features.  However, should, say, an AM34 be produced that's
effectively a variant of the AM33, then that scheme falls down too.

Like I said, it'll make very little difference to most people because few
people go poking around in the arch code.

It is already split up into directories.

I'm confused as to what you're talking about.  asm/cpu-regs.h would not for
general purpose at all.  It would be an arch specific header file and should
not be used by code outside of the arch.
And if all asm/cpu-regs.h does is #include asm/cpu/cpu-regs.h, then what's the
point in having it?

Good point.  That bears moving then.
