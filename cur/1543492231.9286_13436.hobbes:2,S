This is going on and on, and to be honest i find the discussion pretty
interresting and to sat the least, fun to read all the different views.
However, its not really something belonging on this list and therefor id
like to offer to setup a temporary list where everybody interested can
subscribe and discuss this subject in details. This way we can keep the
kernel list for kernel related issues.
Richard and other, if you are interrested, drop me a note, and ill set it
up.
