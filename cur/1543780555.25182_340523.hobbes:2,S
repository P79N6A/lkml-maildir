The fundamental thing is, IT LOCKS UP (for a while), when I do 
"ifconfig eth0 down" and there is active traffic but the card DIES
somehow.  Apparently it requires marginal/unreliable hardware to
happen as well.  (Which for e100 is rather rare.)
That is: at first the card dies, then I notice it, and do the ifconfig.
Then things go _bad_, and recover.  Then I do 'rmmod e100', and
restart network (which reloads the driver module), and things work
once again.
Fedora kernel sources have this "softlockups" patch file: (size and date)
   6159 May 12 04:50 linux-2.6.12-detect-softlockups.patch
That file I can upload, if you want.  Or send in email.
Rest of the RPM-wrapper CPIO package I would prefer not to...
