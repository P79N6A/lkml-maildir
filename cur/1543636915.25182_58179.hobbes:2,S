Thing is: if the people think that it actually _is_ good that Martin is 
the "Linux 2.5 IDE guy", he's got nothing to fear. All I wanted is to 
summon a bit of a discussion about several issues that are not okay in any 
way. It's like with the code itself: either bugs get resolved, or the code 
must be pulled. Of course I guess it'd be cool if the bugs could get 
fixed.
