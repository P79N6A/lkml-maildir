Heh. If Linux 2.2 was his only experience with the system I
could actually understand his opinion. Good thing that the
core parts of the kernel have gotten somewhat more robust
with 2.4 ...
Too bad there probably won't be anyone giving away (or loaning
out) such machines for test machines to port Linux to ;))
