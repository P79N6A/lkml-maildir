My camera just does USB-1, and with a gigabyte card that's just too 
painful. Besides, I don't want to eat camera batteries. So I just pop it 
over in something that is ten times faster.

I don't trust camera firmware to do a full VFAT implementation, so out of 
principle I only let the camera write to it normally. That way I don't 
need to worry about the limited braincapacity of my poor camera.

Sounds like your camera gets easily confused too. Me, I just transfer the 
whole thing, and then I let the camera do a "format". 
I've seen cameras that have serious problems with old filesystems - when 
they get fragmented enough, the camera says that there is 50% free space, 
but can't actually write a single picture any more. Deleting pictures to 
make space only helps a bit, then it's "full" again.
Which is why I just delete everything by letting the camera do the
formatting. 
Some day cameras will run Linux too, and I'll trust them. In the meantime 
I just don't expect them to do that well.
