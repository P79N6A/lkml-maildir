Supporting the ATA Pass-through CDB in libata will enable support for 
all of those things.  I think we all agree that there needs to be _some_ 
way of letting userspace control these attributes via direct ATA command 
submission.
As an aside, although libata _will_ support some sort of user ATA 
command execution method, some of these attributes are (or will be soon) 
available through standard SCSI methods.
For example, MODE SENSE/MODE SELECT on the caching mode page allows one 
to toggle read-ahead and writeback caching.
blktool supports both methods :)
