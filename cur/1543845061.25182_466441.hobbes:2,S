This ability is already available at least for ext2/3 in the old defrag 
package, which can take a list of files and priorities to assign to 
them, and it will pack them in the order given at the start of the disk.
As for your idea, if there is going to be online defrag support in the 
kernel ( and yes, this is a form of defragmenting ) I'd rather see the 
ability to move files around deterministically rather than just give a 
hint and pray, similar to how windows handles online defragmenting.
