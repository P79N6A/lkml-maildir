No, in some cases they want there to not be an IB stack present, which

I don't understand why you persist on this point.  We have a need for an
SMA that is not tied to the IB stack.  The kernel code to support it is
about 500 lines long, about 2% of the driver.

No, we haven't.  The IB protocols are implemented in the ib_ipath
module, not the core driver.
