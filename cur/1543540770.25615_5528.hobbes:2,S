Subject: [ANNOUNCE] linuxjobs mailing list [was [OT] kernel-hacker jobs]
 I have setup such mailing list. To subscribe just do
        echo "subscribe linuxjobs" | mail majordomo@eax.com
If you want to post linux-related job offer, just send email to
        linuxjobs@eax.com
If you want to see jobs offers, just subscribe to the list, as described
above. Eventually, I might setup a web site as well, if there's enough
interest.
