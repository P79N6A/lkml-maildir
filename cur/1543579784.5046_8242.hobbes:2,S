It would have to be implementation dependant/architecture dependant-
The only way to know is to realize that *p initializer value is invalid
is to know:
1. integer addresses MUST be aligned (say 4 or 8 byte boundaries)
2. the computation of (int *) (((char *) &x)+1) is a constant at
   compile time, and not link time (some linkers can do address offset
   calculations if "x" happens to be an external - ie. x +/- offset and
   offset is a constant)
Other systems would have to allow it to compile (and link). It still has
undefined behaviour, and is non-portable.
