I'd say 1...8 (BUG cleanups and removing msi_cache) looks to be on the
safe side to me, though of course, some review by Eric & a bit of
testing would be welcome regardless :-)
The others could go into -mm right away I suppose (or rather as soon as
Eric gets a chance to verify they don't break his test setups as I think
he can test MSI-X) and we can pour them into mainline one by one if
necessary as they get hammered / verified.
Cheers,
Ben.
