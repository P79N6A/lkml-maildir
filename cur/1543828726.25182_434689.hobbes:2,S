No, when the priority 1 (userspace prio) expires just before the 
priority 99.

Look at this situation:
softirq-hrt, running some callback, is priority 1 (US prio as always) 
blocked for a mutex owned by some task, A. This now have priority 1 (in 
the worst case).The HRT interrupt comes and calls setscheduler(... prio 99).
That doesn't change the priority of task A as far as I can see from the code.
So in effect the priority 99 callback will wait for task A which is still
priority 1. That is a priority inversion.

The two worst cases are:
1) The system wide system 99 worst case latency is at least that of the 
longest callback.
2) The worst case latency of softirq-hrt is that of priority 1.
If you could set it by chrt you could at least choose which evil thing you 
want.

Me neither :-) Running sofhtirq-hrt at priority 99 - or whatever is 
set by chrt - should be sufficient.
