I would suggest building the PCI device tree using the OF device tree.
64-bit PowerPC does this already, perhaps you can use some of the
existing code for your case too.
Sparc64 does as 64-bit PowerPC does.
I can't even program the PCI-E root controller in PCI config space on
sparc64 Niagara systems, so I just virtualize it.
