	wow, it's not as easy as the man page wrote.
	i thought clone(2) does what your start_thread() does.
	but i need to explain the code to the others, the assembly
	stuff, like what's exactly "testl %0, %0" means.
	why the kernel doesn't call the thread function like
	the man page says (or is it written for glibc?)
	thank you very much
	imel
