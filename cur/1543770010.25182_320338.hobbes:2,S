Yes, I did look at that and this would be a big change that would
affect almost all architectures. I was thinking something like
this would be more appropriate as part of the PCI rewrite that
Adam Belay had proposed.

No, 6 is not guaranteed but would cover a larger percentage of
systems. 8 would probably cover all but a few special cases.

The concern here isn't just increasing the size of pci_bus. The
resource pointers in pci_bus point to resource structures in the
corresponding pci_dev structure for p2p bridges. If we want to
maintain this scheme, we'd have to increase the number of resources
in the pci_dev structure too, which increases it for every single
pci device in the system. Probably ok for big server machines, but
would others (e.g. embedded folks) complain?
I just realized that I did not explicitly CC Greg in my original
post. Doing that now, to see what he thinks.
