Subject: [GIT *] Remove inclusion of obsolete <linux/config.h>
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Linus, please pull from git://git.infradead.org/~dwmw2/killconfig.h.git
This contains two commits. The first removes all inclusions of
<linux/config.h> from the kernel sources, and the second turns
include/linux/config.h into a one-line #error.
I chose to add #error rather than just deleting the file, to make the
error message more informative and hopefully prevent too many people
from asking "where did config.h go?".
Sam thinks it should be a #warning instead, even though it's been
unnecessary to include config.h for about eight months now. If you
agree, pull from git://git.infradead.org/~dwmw2/woundconfig.h.git
instead -- that contains the same first commit and then the second
commit creates a #warning instead.
Please pull one or the other.
