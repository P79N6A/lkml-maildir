Thanks for information.
But there are some moments: 
1. "When Microsoft moved to buy Hotmail in 1997, it was already 
running on FreeBSD". And they (M$) can say that they don't want to 
change soft until it works...
2. FreeBSD in the free system, Novell is commertial. One think - use 
free soft, another - to buy it from main concurrent*
3. Hotmail is only owned by Microsoft, www.microsoft.com is the face 
of Microsoft - main site.
This is situation like .... I don't know - for example: if mr.Ford 
(man, not company) will use as his personal auto not Lincoln 
(produced on Ford's plants) but ... Mercedes or Cytroenn, for 
example...  And say this time that Lincoln is the best car in the 
world...
Best regards,
George
