OK - a few details/matters of taste:
- how about similar dcache_lock-safe versions of d_op->revalidate()
and i_op->follow_link()?
- an alternative to separate methods is to add a "noblock" argument 
to the existing methods. This entails more breakage in the short term.
- permission_light() or permission_lite()? :-)
