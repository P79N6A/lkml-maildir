Is that all files, or just ones that were being changed?

A single block of zeros - its possible that the crash occurred between
the allocation transaction and the data write - the allocation gets
replayed (along with the new file size), but the data write does
not (not journalled). This is one of the rarer "NULL files on crash"
failure modes fixed in 6.5.22.....
Cheers,
Dave.
