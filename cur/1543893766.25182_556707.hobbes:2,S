I guess a motherboard don't provide enough current to
burn out that speaker.
But generally, speakers that handle some maximum
alternating current *will* burn out if you give them
the same amount DC.  This becasue speakers
are designed to handle AC - some of the energy is dissipated
as sound waves, some as an alternating magnetic field,
some has heat. And the speaker moves, so moving
air helps cooling it.
A speaker getting DC converts all that current into heat only,
and it stands still so no extra cooling.  So it burns out.
