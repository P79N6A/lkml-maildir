If there was a 'release' version of both the kernel and utils that would
work with it, I'm sure the number of messages would reduce dramatically. The
main problem I had when trying to get ISDN to work was finding a matching
kernel and utils. In the end I found Paul Slootman's web page which said
that 2.0.35 worked, so I downgraded to that.

Why should Red Hat acknowledge ISDN when there has never been anything other
than a beta version of the ISDN utils. I'm sure they don't want to spend
lots of time trying to choose the particular CSV tree snapshot that works
correctly with a particuar kernel.

There are bugs in the older versions. The copy of isdnlog I use (from
isdn4k-utils-2.1b1) doesn't work with all combination of command line
options and needs a delay of 30s before it runs in my startup scripts to get
it working. It would be nice to resolve these problems so there is always a
desire to upgrade. So far the way ISDN4linux has been developed makes it
difficult, especially for someone who doesn't really understand the code.

But I for one don't really have the knowledge to use CVS (well I haven't
spent the time to learn) so I resort to the SUSE snapshots, where you then
have to work out which kernel they work with.
I get the impression that too many linux developers persist with a beta
description for their software long after it surpasses the quality of some
MS Windows software. This then confuses people and discourages newbies from
trying it.
If the ISDN development could mirror the feature freeze then bug fix of the
kernel, I think more people would be using it and therefore provide more
input, thus actually progressing it faster.
