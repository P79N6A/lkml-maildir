Seems to work ok on a Via VT8251 controller (AHCI) on kernel
2.6.21-rc6-git4 without my NCQ disabling patch.
By the way, on this machine, I had a lot of SATA timeouts during
kernel boot, which were solved by appending "nomsi".  Do you believe
there might be a relation to the NCQ problems on my first (Nforce)
machine?
