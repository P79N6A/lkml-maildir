Hey, very good.  I don't have an i820 but I am working with the AGPGART
driver so I can say everything looks good.  I am actually working on a
rewrite; I find it ridiculous we need all these specific 820 functions. 
I am have a design where we load a lookup table, index by the enum, with
the register information and then a generic function can load in the
right value.  I really working on cleaning the cruft up ...
I do have two comments, though.  I would suggest if you don't hear
anything negative and the patch works for you to go ahead and send it to
Alan and Linus, although you should make sure it is diffed against their
newest trees.

I'm not too sure why you need this.  I see other chipsets have their
device 0:01 defined but I can't reason why.  When I add AGP drivers I
never add it.  If you remove it, I think you will find everything still
works.

You can just use intel_generic_fetch_size or even one of the
i840-specific or whatever versions, here.  Note you don't use anything
specific to the i820, so reduce the footprint and ditch it.
