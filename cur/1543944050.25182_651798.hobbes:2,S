If, by "interesting", you mean that they give the most power to the user 
in setting up their mempolicies than they have ever had before, then I 
agree.

If my helper functions are similar to yours then basing either of our 
patchsets on top of the other should not be difficult.

Thanks for volunteering to test the changes.  I don't know how many 
patchsets are currently outstanding that touch mempolicies.  So far we 
have mine and the refcounting cleanup of yours that you mentioned.
I think the best way of dealing with it would be for the author of 
whatever patchset is merged second to rebase off the current -mm just like 
I based this entire patchset on your V3 contextualize_policy() patch from 
a couple days ago.

My patchset already supports contextualized tmpfs mempolicies with a 
template for how to specify them (see patch 4 in this series for the 
documentation update).  For example, mpol=interleave:1-3 is the equivalent 
of MPOL_INTERLEAVE over nodes 1-3 while mpol=interleave=static:1-3 is the
equivalent of MPOL_INTERLEAVE | MPOL_F_STATIC_NODES.
