Ok I'm getting this message every couple of minutes:

This is on a SuperMicro Dual PPro board.  I have a Intel Dual PPro
board at home and it doesn't happen.  I didn't notice this with any of
the 2.2-pre kernels, but I wasn't looking for it either.  I have just
started playing with the Coda filesystem on that machine.  Could it
somehow be related to Coda?  Could it be the beginning of a hardware
failure?!
I can play with it some.  I'll try to go back to one of the pre 2.2
kernels and see if it really goes away or not.  But, I thought I'd
post just in case someone has some idea what's going on or any ideas
on what I should try.
	Thanks,
	Rick Niles.
