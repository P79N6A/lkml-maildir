We explicitly need to use a copy of the lockdep_map for "locking" the
work struct as per the quoted comment. So as far as I can tell, what
INIT_WORK() is doing here is changing an at that point unused copy of
the lockdep map so I think it should be fine. Not sure about the other
fine points nor why you'd want this though :)
