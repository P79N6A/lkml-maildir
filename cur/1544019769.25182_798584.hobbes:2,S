cpuset-fix-allocating-page-cache-slab-object-on-the-unallowed-node-when-memory-spread-is-set.patch
breaks compiles with CONFIG_CPUSETS=n
  CC      init/main.o
init/main.c: In function 'kernel_init':
init/main.c:876: error: 'struct task_struct' has no member named 'mems_allowed'
make[1]: *** [init/main.o] Error 1
Looks like it adds a reference to task->mems_allowed to kernel/main.c
and kernel/kthreads.c and neither one is wrapped with #ifdef CONFIG_CPUSETS
or anything.
