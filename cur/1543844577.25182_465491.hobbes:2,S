Subject: [PATCH 0/7] Using %gs for per-cpu areas on x86
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

OK, here it is.  Benchmarks still coming.  This is against Andi's
2.6.18-rc7-git3 tree, and replaces the patches between (and not
including) i386-pda-asm-offsets and i386-early-fault.
One patch is identical, one is mildly modified, the rest are
re-implemented but inspired by Jeremy's PDA work.
Thanks,
Rusty.
