Martin,
I asked you off line to slow down so I can fix a few issues.
I have acknowledged you ideas are good but are woefully untimely.
Obviously you have some agenada with a StartUp company because you work
for a Germnay Venture Capital firm.
Maybe it would be more useful if you bothered to feed the code via the
correct paths.  Since I am going to reject it until I can review it, and
have made very clear there are some core problems to address.  You can
make all kinds of fancy rewrites all day long but until the bottom
transport is finished it will still break.
Regards,
