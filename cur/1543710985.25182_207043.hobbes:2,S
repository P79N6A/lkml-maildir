Two notes:
1.
This could be handled by only including patches of those people who
consent to their address being published,
2.
The user does not have to give a routable mail address in
BK_USER/BK_HOST, but he can set BK_HOST to whatever he wants.
If the whole corruption is intentional, then I'd suggest that RMK
participates in the maintenance of the lk-changelog.pl aka. shortlog
script. I have no chance to resolve common names through
google/lbdb/grep -r on the suspect source files unless the address is
there. There are so many people called Jonas Larsson - how do I know if
that fellow has a middle name?
