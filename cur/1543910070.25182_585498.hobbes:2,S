Sure, "volatile-qualified access" was not some standard term I used
there. Just something to mean "an access that would make the compiler
treat the object at that memory as if it were an object with a
volatile-qualified type".
Now the second wording *IS* technically correct, but come on, it's
24 words long whereas the original one was 3 -- and hopefully anybody
reading the shorter phrase *would* have known anyway what was meant,
without having to be pedantic about it :-)
