Well, if you take a look at mongo.pl available at www.namesys.com we 
provide you with a fractal file size generation program that you might 
want to look at, that mongo uses during the creation portion of its 
benchmark.
It makes 80% of the files less than some amount (100 bytes, or 1k, or 
4k, depending on how mean you want to be to ext2;-) ), then 80% of the 
remaining 20% less than 10 times that amount then....
There is more than one version of the file size generation code, so make 
sure you got the one that works as I described above.  I am looking for 
a formula to smooth the above behavior into some sort of gentle curve 
rather than sharp bands, but I haven't found it yet.
