This sounds like a good idea. But one problem I could imagine is that you
can build several different versions of a module, e.g.:
<M> Reiserfs support
  [ ]   Enable reiserfs debug mode
  [ ]   Stats in /proc/fs/reiserfs
If you build all modules you have 2x2=4 possibilities to build the
Reiserfs module and the question whether to enable the debug mode or not
has a big impact on the performance.
