Unless I am missing something, I was hoping for more of a sparse DRM implementation; not a blanket.
I was hoping to be able to `modprobe drm` for when I needed to use DRM and likewise `rmmod drm` for when I didn't want it.  Maybe I am a little late in this disucssion, but that's just my hopes and whishes.
