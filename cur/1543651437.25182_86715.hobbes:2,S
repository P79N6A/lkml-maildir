User-mode code will reset the RTF_UP bit in the rt_flags member
of struct rtentry. This is the SIOCDELRT ioctl call. I have found
that, at least for 2.4.18 and previous, you need to delete any
previous route with the same parameters before setting any new one.
It seems that a default route ends up being set by merely setting
parameters for the interface.
