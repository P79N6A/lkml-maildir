O.K., I scanned both the linux-kernel and linux-ipchains list and didn't
find anything so...
I just compiled 2.2.5 SMP and my ipchains does not work anymore.  They
were working fine with 2.2.4.  Any clues?  I didn't see anything in
Documentation/...  I didn't see a new version of ipchains...
Thanks,
Fred Reimer
