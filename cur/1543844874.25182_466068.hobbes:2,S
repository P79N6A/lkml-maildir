But how about the anonymous mmap with PROT_EXEC set?
This is exactly what the malicious loader will do, it
won't do the shared (or private) file-backed mmap.
So your technique doesn't restrict the malicious
loaders, including the potential script loader you
were referring to. It doesn't even make their life
any harder. Only the properly-written programs suffer.
Or, in case of ceasing to use noexec - the security.
