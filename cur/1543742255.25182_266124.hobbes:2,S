i've implemented this feature and have put it into -RT-V0.5.5 which can
be downloaded from the usual place:
	
http://redhat.com/~mingo/realtime-preempt/
i've attached a simple testcase showing how to use it. When running the 
testcode on a -V0.5.5 kernel it gives:
 saturn:~> ./rt-atomic
 testing atomic mode functionality.
 ok, kernel supports atomic mode.
 atomic mode is now off - doing sleep(), should succeed:
 turning atomic mode on.
 doing getppid() syscall - should succeed.
 doing sleep() syscall - should abort!
 User defined signal 1
the kernel sends SIGUSR1 when it detects illegal scheduling. (change the
SIGUSR1 in the patch if you want another signal.)
could someone with more Jackd experience than me add this to the Jackd
code and check whether and where it triggers? I'd suggest to do
something like around the poll() call:
	atomic_off();
	poll();
	atomic_on();
and add an atomic_off() to the Jackd shutdown handler (or any codepath
that is legitimately allowed to schedule).
