Subject: [PATCH 0/4] map multiple blocks in get_block() and mpage_readpages()

Hi,
Following patches add support to map multiple blocks in ->get_block().
This is will allow us to handle mapping of multiple disk blocks for
mpage_readpages() and mpage_writepages() etc. Instead of adding new
argument, I use "b_size" to indicate the amount of disk mapping needed
for get_block(). And also, on success get_block() actually indicates
the amount of disk mapping it did.
Now that get_block() can handle multiple blocks, there is no need
for ->get_blocks() which was added for DIO.
[PATCH 1/4] change buffer_head.b_size to size_t
[PATCH 2/4] pass b_size to ->get_block()
[PATCH 3/4] map multiple blocks for mpage_readpages()
[PATCH 4/4] remove ->get_blocks() support
I noticed decent improvements (reduced sys time) on JFS, XFS and ext3.
(on simple "dd" read tests).

Andrew, Could you include it in -mm tree ?
