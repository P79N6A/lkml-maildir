That should be:
  add_wait_queue(&my_wait_queue, &wait);
  current->state = TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE;
otherwise there is a chance that the interrupt could occur between
the TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE and the add_wait_queue.  If this does happen,
the task will not be on my_wait_queue, and therefore the state will
not be set to TASK_RUNNING.
