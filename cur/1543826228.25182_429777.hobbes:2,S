Please don't do this, I'll explain why.
Using __sparc_v9__ is incorrect, here is the lowdown on these defines:
1) __sparc_v9__ means "-mcpu={ultrasparc*,niagara}" or "-mcpu=v9".
   Although this is implied by "-m64" it can be used for 32-bit
   code too.
   __sparc_v9__ means "using v9 instructions" which does not
   necessarily mean 64-bit
2) "__sparc__ && __arch64__" means 64-bit sparc
People often get this wrong, and it certainly is confusing.
Jakub Jelinek gives a good explanation on the gcc mailing
list here:
