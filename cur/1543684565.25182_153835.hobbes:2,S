Hi,
I had a build failure because of missing symbols with setting IDE to
module. The relevant part of the used configuration is below. And:
It's possible to select modulable drivers with y, even when building
ide as module is selected.
Please Cc answers to me as I'm not subsribed to l-k.
Cheers,
Andi
