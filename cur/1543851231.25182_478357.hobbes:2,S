as just one example, you can read in include/asm-alpha/atomic.h:
/*
 * Counter is volatile to make sure gcc doesn't try to be clever
 * and move things around on us. We need to use _exactly_ the address
 * the user gave us, not some alias that contains the same information.
 */
now it may be that *some* architectures don't specifically require a
volatile counter but, AFAIK, it doesn't actually hurt if it isn't
necessary.  OTOH, if it isn't necessary *at all* for *any*
architecture, then that storage class should be *removed* in its
entirety.
in any event, all this is is another example of what appears to be
niggling and unnecessary differences between arch-specific header
files that could easily be turned into a single, standard definition
that would work for everyone with very little effort (and perhaps some
day be included from a single generic header file to avoid all that
duplication in the first place).
