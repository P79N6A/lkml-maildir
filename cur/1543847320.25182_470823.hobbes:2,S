Another thing to add:  I don't think this corruption is related to the
PIIX4 controller. For some days (when we put the machines that were
backed-up into production), we tried to work with an external USB HDD.
(The backup box is off-site and only has limited bandwidth, so the
idea was to move the USB HDD to the main site if we were on fire
there. We gave up this idea due to too small USB performance.)
However, I've seen this problem twice with the USB-attached disk, too.
It's the exact same disk, we just threw away the case.
MfG, JBG
