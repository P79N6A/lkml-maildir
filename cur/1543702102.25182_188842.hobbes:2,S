Can you maybe share some details?  I think this deign moves MORE state to
userspace (expiry aside).  The "state" in kernel is really mostly sent back
to userspace.  No more passing pipes into the kernel (state) or tracking the
pgid of the daemon (state).

I don't think this design crams anything into the kernel.  It doesn't put a
whole lot more into the kernel than is currently in there (expiry and new
mount stuff, aside).  All the work still happens in userland.
The daemon as it stands does NOT handle namespaces, does NOT handle expiry
well, and is a pretty sad copy of an old design.

I have some customers I'd love to send to you, if you really think that's
true.
