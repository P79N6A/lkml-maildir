I see. Thus the correct answer is: process pointed by "current" is the
parent of the process pointed by "p" when elsa_task_alloc_security() is
called.

I understand your point of view. Elsa is accounting related that's true
but I'm trying to provide a solution without modifying the Linux kernel
tree. To achieve this I just need a hook in the fork to be inform when a
process creates a child. LSM hook does the trick and it is already in
the kernel. That's why I use the LSM hook (and I'm waiting to see PAGG
or CKRM in the Linux kernel).
Thanks,
