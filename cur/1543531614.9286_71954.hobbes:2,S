I'm not sure I understand what you're saying here Alan...  My
guess is you're taking VM to mean the kernel virtual memory
system, when I'm meaning it to be "virtual machine".  So my
sentence really should read 'faster virtual machine speeds'.  I
remember a thread earlier this year on IBM tweaking the virtual
memory system so I think that is what you're talking about..
If this is the case, then it is my mistake for using an unclear
abbreviation.  ;o)

Hmm..  You've lost me a bit here..  Let me guess what you're
getting at..
The 'hypervisor' is a new term to me..  Are you refering to the
Transmeta CPU and it's native mode?  If I read you correctly
here, then we could have a native VLIW kernel running on the
Crusoe, which opens an x86 API to userland?  Correct me if I'm
wrong.

The a386 port?

Have you been dipping into the bubbly a bit?  ;o)

I've overclocked my keyboard interface.  It's quite messy dipping my
hands into the mineral oil, but *MAN* is my keyboard ever fast now!
