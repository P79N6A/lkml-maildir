Subject: [PATCH] [DLM] fix receive_request() lvb copying
LVB's are not sent as part of new requests, but the code receiving the
request was copying data into the lvb anyway.  The space in the message
where it mistakenly thought the lvb lived actually contained the resource
name, so it wound up incorrectly copying this name data into the lvb.  Fix
is to just create the lvb, not copy junk into it.
