i've re-released the patch because shortly after releasing it i found a
false-positive in the deadlock-detector that was triggering in oowriter. 
The latest patch is thus:
 $ md5sum realtime-preempt-2.6.9-rc4-mm1-U6
 9fd546bdd2d45ff1a8d5a88160135170  realtime-preempt-2.6.9-rc4-mm1-U6
if you've got the earlier one and have CONFIG_RWSEM_DEADLOCK_DETECT
enabled then please download the new patch.
	Ingo
