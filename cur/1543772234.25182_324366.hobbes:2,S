I have only looked that this briefly and I didn't see off hand where you get
the "r9=[r10]" sequence from --- I hope you're not relying on the compiler
happening to generate this sequence!
More importantly: please avoid inline "asm" and use the intrinsics
defined by gcc_intrin.h instead (if you need something new, we can add
that), but I think ia64_getreg() will do much of what you want already.
Thanks,
