Wrong.
(1)  The '486 didn't have the rdtsc instruction.
(2)  There are no 'serializing' or other black-magic aspects of
using the internal cycle-counter. That's exactly how you you
can benchmark the execution time of accessible code sequences.

You never average the cycle-time. The cycle-time is absolute.
You need to remove the affect of interrupts when you measure
performance so you need to sample a few times and save the
lowest number. That's the number obtained during the testing interval,
was not interrupted.
The provided code allows you to experiment. You can set the
TRIES count to 1. You will find that the results are noisy if
you are connected to an active network. Good results can be
obtained with it set to 4 if your computer is not being blasted
with lots of broadcast packets from M$ servers.
