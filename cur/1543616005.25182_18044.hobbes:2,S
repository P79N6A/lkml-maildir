Ben, 
I suppose you're talking about the following case: 
pagecache code has LRU page
			    nonpagecache code does page_cache_get()
pagecache code does page_cache_release()
			   nonpagecache code does __free_pages_ok()
			   on LRU page: BOOM.	
Is my thinking correct ?
If so, I don't see why Ed's trace BUGs at rmqueue first: It should bug at
__free_pages_ok() PageLRU check.
