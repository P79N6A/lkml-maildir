I've been seeing a lot of problems with reiserfs that I
don't see on ext2 or ext3, so I would tend to agree with you.
Do you know where I could post for the reiserfs folks?
Did you see the backtrace for the second CPU?  It does
include SCSI and block subsystem components.
The controller on board the dell 2650 is Adaptec:
