Actually, I get two reboots. One expected after suspend and one
unexpected after resume.
TEST_SWSUSP is one so I can test it properly. I want to be Linus's
swsusp same as mine for 2.5. TEST_SWSUSP is going to be 0 at 2.6.

Can you do multiple S4 enters/leaves? Good test is to make bzImage
while doing while true; do echo 4 > /proc/acpi/sleep; sleep 30; done.

Okay.

I don't understand that line, either. Andrea told me to write it like
that, IIRC ;-).

Throttling the CPU should be pretty easy [see
/proc/acpi/processor/0/*], and it should already enter sleep modes for
you.
