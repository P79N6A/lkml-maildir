Hello Bartlomiej,

we implemented the PIIX controller as part of an Intel Southbridge
82371AB[1] Chip so I didn't thought that it was also available as
seperate PCI Device. Do you have any pointers to products or better
sepcification of this products?
If this is the case that would be the best solution for our problem.
