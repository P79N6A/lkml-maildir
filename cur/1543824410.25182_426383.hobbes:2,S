Some CF adapters I've seen included all necessary pins but the pin
connections for DMA were missing. Someone at a slackware mailing list
was having the same problem, and if I recall correctly (better check
specs though) it can be fixed quite easily:
CF pin 44: disconnect from +V, connect to IDE pin 29.
CF pin 43: connect to IDE pin 21.
Typical transfer rates increased to about 10-12 MB/s
