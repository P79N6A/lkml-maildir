Well, the console was left on the swsusp VT (guess that's not suprising)
and I was hurrying to catch the train, so I didn't investigate, I just
held down the power button for 5 seconds.

Hard.  It's a Thinkpad X40 with ACPI, so I hold down the power button
for a few seconds to power off.

Yes, I'd seen that happen on earlier swsusps, so I was quite suprised
when it blew up like this.
Perhaps the image should be more rigorously checked?  I'm wishing that
it would verify that the header and the image matched, after it finishes
reading the image.  For example, computing the hash
MD5(header || image)     (|| denotes "concatenate" in crypto pseudocode.)
and storing that hash in a final trailing block.  Additionally, of
course, as soon as the resume has read the image it should overwrite the
header; and the header should include jiffies or something along those
lines to ensure that it won't accidentally have the same contents as the
previous image's header.
The hash doesn't have to be MD5; even a CRC should suffice I think...
