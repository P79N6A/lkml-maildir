I'm not a wizard, if i will answer now: "No." [1:]

If you ever tried to report bug with reportbug tool in Debian, you may
understand what i meant. Nothing can substitute intelligence. Something
can reduce impact of laziness (of searching relevant bugreports).

They also don't bother subscribing to mailing lists and like to write
blogs. I'm not sure about hw databases you talked about, i will talk
about gathering information from testers.
Debian have experimental and unstable branches, people willing to have
new stuff are likely to have this, and not testing or stable. BTS just
collects bugreports <
http://bugs.debian.org/>.
 If kernel team uploads new
kernel (release or even rc recently), interested people will use it after
next upgrade. Bug reports get collected, but main answer will be, try
reproduce on most recent kernel.org's one. Here, what i have proposed,
may play role you expect. Mis-configuration/malfunctioning, programmer's
error (Linus noted) in organized manner may easily join reporting person
to kernel.org's testing. On driver or small sub-system level this may
work. Again it's all about information, not intelligence.
