But that's my point if you had a previously working mach64 with 6.8.2
with a DRM from around then, and a kernel upgrade broke the DRM you
should be just able to upgrade the DRM to the latest DRM CVS, there
isn't any such thing as a 6.8.2 DRM, you'll only cause much more
issues trying to fix an issue in the kernel side by also
simultaneously upgrading userspace... as you've no fixed working point
to try from..
The mach64 drm is in CVS on cvs.freedesktop.org:/cvs/dri and the module is drm..
