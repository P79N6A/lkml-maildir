There is surely a need for having fonts in-kernel, at least one, otherwise
most non-x86 platforms will not be very happy ;)
Being able to select a font on the kernel command line can be handy, e.g.
for people for which the default font is too tiny that they cannot read it -
they can use sun12x22 font in that case.
On the other side, marking all fonts as __init and copying it to alloced
space is not a bad idea.
Cheers,
