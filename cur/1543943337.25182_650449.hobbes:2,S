I already gave you the necessary details for how to set 
NTP_INTERVAL_LENGTH and in the previous mail I explained the basis for it. 
I really don't understand what's your problem with it. Why do you try to 
make it more complex than necessary?

You don't create consistency by adding corrections all over the place 
until it adds up to the right sum.
The current correction is already somewhat of a hack and I'd rather get 
rid of it than to let it spread all over the place (it's really only 
needed so that people with weird HZ settings don't hit the 500ppm limit 
and we're basically cheating to the ntpd by not telling it the real 
frequency). Please keep the knowledge about this crutch at a single place 
and don't spread it.
Anyway, for NO_HZ this correction is completely irrelevant, so again 
there's no point in adding random values all over the place until you get 
the correct result.
The only other alternative would be to calculate this correction 
dynamically. For this you leave NTP_INTERVAL_LENGTH as is and when 
changing clocks you check whether "abs(((cs->xtime_interval * 
NTP_INTERVAL_FREQ) >> cs->shift) - NSEC_PER_SEC)" exceeds a certain limit 
(e.g. 200usec) and in this case you print a warning message, that the 
clock has large base drift value and is a bad ntp source and apply a 
correction value. This way the correction only hits the very few system 
which might need it and it would be the prefered solution, but it also 
requires a few more changes.
