 has help.
I was out of town last week, and will be out this week as well.  Won't be
able to do the bisection until next week at the earliest, but I have remote
access to the box if there's anything useful to be done that doesn't require
a reboot.  No logs available for the "no sd access" case: I'd have to rig up
something to record the console output during boot if that's needed.  Here's
hoping someone else is seeing this or can replicate it in the meantime.
