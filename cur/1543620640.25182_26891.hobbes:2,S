Modulo bugs.
For some reason, on my work machine, "make" will not correctly check out
files that are "include"d from the makefile.
On my home machine, it will.
The really interesting thing is, they're both make 3.79.1.
Besides, I'd at least personally rather do "bk -r get -q" than have to
watch those SCCS files and BitKeeper files. That way the filename
completion works inside the shell too..
