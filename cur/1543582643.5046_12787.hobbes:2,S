Well, message is not accurate. It refuses to hold this particular
orphan, because it feels that too much of memory is consumed.
Change number Z and the message will disappear.
Poor orphans are the first victims, because they have nobody
to take care of, but kernel. And kernel is harsh parent. 8)

Really? Well, it is unlikely to have something with net.
Your dumps show that at 6000 connections networking eated less
than 10MB of memory. Probably, swapping is mistuned.

This is also debugging. Harmless.
> 2) The error about "too many orphans" is bogus?
Yes. It is sort of desinformation. It means really that
accounting detected excess of limits, which are set.
> 3) I will get a lot of debug crap i syslog
It will disappear as soon as debugging is disabled. I.e. when
kernel will enter distributions, I guess.
If I was responsible for this, I would not kill them.
The more messages is the better. Otherwise you would have
nothing to report and even did not notice that something is wrong. 8)

Probably this has nothing to do with tcp, but explained by some
vm failure, sort of oom killer.
