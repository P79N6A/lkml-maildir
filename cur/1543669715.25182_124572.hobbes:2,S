Have you looked at relayfs?  I think it might do much the same thing as
this, but through a fs interface, instead of a char device node.

I don't think you can just count the number of open fds, like your patch
does to get a count of who all read this message (fds can close and
others can open, so newer fds might not have read the message before it
is removed.)
Looks like a good start, but I'm not moving the hotplug interface over
to it :)
