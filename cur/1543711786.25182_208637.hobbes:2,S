I don't have examples of such, no. The requirement was imposed on me for
basically the reason that what cpu-related API's preceded cpumask_t
compiled out to nops on UP and no indirection on small SMP. If you've
got such an implementation that compiles out to nops on UP etc., or can
get the requirement(s) dropped, I'm all ears.
