a no-modules enabled kernel.
when booting screen fills up with following message:
linux/drivers/char/random.c
	void get_random_bytes(void *buf, int nbytes) {
        	printk(KERN_NOTICE "get_random_bytes called before "
                                   "random driver initialization\n");
this message is repeated ad-inifintum. forcing pressing reset button.
doing s/printk/panic/ and recompile shows that the last things shown
before this is:
NET4:
...
IPv6 v0.8 for NET4.0
IPv6 over IPv4 tunneling driver
early initialization of device sit0 is deferred
IrDA (tm) Protocols for Linux-2.3 (Dag Brattli)
get_random_bytes called before random driver initalization
Kernel panic: <5> get_random_bytes called before random driver init
It was fairly hard find since it is not printed via plain printk() 
(ie what I did grep for first), but via a MESSAGE() preprocessor
wrapper.
linux/net/irda/irmod.c
	int __init irda_init(void) {
        	MESSAGE("IrDA (tm) Protocols for Linux-2.3 (Dag Brattli)\n");
        	irlmp_init();
        	irlap_init();
in the  irda dir both irmlpl.c and irlap.c call get_random_bytes.
