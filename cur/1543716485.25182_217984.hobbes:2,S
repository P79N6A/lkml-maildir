Well, the trace looks fine, except the box was hung at the time of the
trace capturing. And most of the trace is the same as I had reported with
NMI watchdog. This is the only thing I was going to say.
So far the box I experienced NMI WD oops on works and does not hang.
And I posted previous oops on lkml.
If something will happen to it again, I won't keep it secret for sure ;)
Bye,
