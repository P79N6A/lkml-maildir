Display panning is what makes scrolling fast which is the default scroll
method if vyres > yres.  Unfortunately, tdfxfb occasionally have
problems with this method, the higher the vyres, the greater the
likelihood of screen corruption. That's why tdfxb limits the vyres to a
maximum of 4096. As to why the problem disappeared just by changing this
parameter, that I too don't know.
