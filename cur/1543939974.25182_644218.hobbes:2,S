Pfft, that should have been:
	for c in $(git rev-list --reverse origin..linux-nfs/nfs-server-stable^); do
		git checkout $c
		make -s -j4
	done
The results are a lot easier to understand if you do the compiles
in chronological order!
Anyway, that found one more compile failure, now fixed.  Hopefully
that's the last.  (Probably I did an incomplete job of reordering one of
the patches the other week....)
