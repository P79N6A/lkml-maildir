That won't work. The else-if clause has to be within the context of the parent
function in which it now resides.
It might actually be better to make /proc/kcore conditional on CONFIG_MMU.

No. The compiler can, if it wishes, inline this function as it is now. Putting
it in a separate file removes that option.

No. The compiler, if it inlines get_vmalloc_info() can avoid allocating a
whole struct vmalloc_info if it wishes in the current scheme of things, and
can generate better code by inserting the constants when it needs them.

Most definitely not! What these are is a per-arch decision, and m68knommu at
least has things set up differently. FRV doesn't even define these for !MMU.

Good point. That ended up in the nommu patch, where this CONFIG_MMU should've
been.

I think, perhaps, some of linux/mm.h should perhaps be split out into separate
MMU and !MMU header files, which then get included as appropriate by
linux/mm.h.

*sigh*. I'm trying to keep the time things take to boot and the amount of
space the kernel image occupies down, and you're trying to push both back
up. All these empty stubs consume time and space.

How's that going to help? A few of the VM options may still apply to !MMU.
