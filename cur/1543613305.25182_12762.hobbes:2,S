I first tried, but it all somehow fucked up.
So I tried again - better this time. Same result as with Tux, just that
the system's idle. All the apache processes goes defunct, and the total
i/o as reported by vmstat is peaking at aouund 1000 blocks per sec. Not a
lot, really...
So sorry, Ingo and you other tux guys, it wasn't your fault.
