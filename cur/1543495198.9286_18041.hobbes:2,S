The mechanism is in the handling of the p->defer value.
If the proces runs out of it's time slice, it gets
put away in time according to it's priority. If it
sleeps and returns after p->defer has happened, it
will get full priority and p->counter will be set
to full.
Handling of interactive and multimedia tasks will
be done because CPU hogs are pushed back in time
and interactive and multimedia tasks aren't put
back as much.
I'll write an explanation of my algorithm later
this week, but I believe that it'll give performance
equal to or better than the current scheduler.
I really welcome tests -- I'll do one myself against
2.2.7 tomorrow because the new interrupt handling in
2.2.8 doesn't allow me to boot :(
cheers,
