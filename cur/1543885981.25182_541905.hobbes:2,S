There is a 96 sized general slab. So it would go up to that size. But you 
can create a 80 byte slab of course. And that may cost minimal overhead 
since 80 byte slabs may be merged. If one already exist then you get it 
for free.

96 please. You skipped the first part.

SLUB can generate an 80 byte slab with minimal overhead if you wanted. But 
yes I agree the flexbility there is an advantage if you have objects of 
various sizes.
