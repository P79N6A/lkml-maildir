Oh wonderful.  It has happenned to me, too, test9, Slackware 9.1,
cdrecord 2.0a19 (same as yours).  I think there's a problem with DMA -
it wasnt' enabled when this happened.  When I enabled it, CD's burned
normally.  And this happened only when I built SCSI support (sg, sr_mod)
as modules.. when in core, DMA is enabled automatically and _stays_
enabled...
