Still, the HPET doesn't necessarily have to be a 64-bit device. At least
on AMD systems, where it's implemented in AMD8111 Thor, it's bundled
together with other, 32-bit PCI devices like USB. On the other hand, the
8111 HPET doesn't implement a 64-bit conter, and it's likely that the
Intel implementation in the northbridges (or *CH, as Intel prefers
calling the things) is likely native 64-bit.
