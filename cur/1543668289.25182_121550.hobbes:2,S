Hi,
I'm using printk for the device driver I'm writing.It doesn't give the 
output to my console and the only way I can get those is just using
cat  /proc/kmsg.But what I want is to get console prints while I'm 
running .Then I put the kernel image of the remote system where it used 
to give console output.Still I'm not getting any output to the screen.I 
tried to use console_print ....not giving any result to the console.So I 
would like to know what can I do about this
Thanx in advance.
Vj
