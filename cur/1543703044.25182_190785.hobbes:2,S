Hi,
The first message was cut short, sorry
I grabbed the auto.smb script for mounting samba/windows shares. One of the flaws is that I'd
like to get around is that it must be configured as root and most importantly that I don't see who 
is requesting the mount. I was thinking along the line of mounting shares in /cifs/$USER/servers/share
or simply mounting the share for the first user using the mount point (essentially single user machines
anyway).
the auto.smb script is running as root and I printed some info in root.c at the revalidate

Jan 12 18:49:08 h6n2fls33o811 last message repeated 10 times
and lots more from mounting with uid=0
Is there any simple way of passing the first uid to the automounter?
