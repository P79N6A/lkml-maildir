Subject: [2.6 patch] add NAPI help texts
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/6/4/129

NAPI seems to be so self-explaining that no help texts are needed. ;-)
I combined the two help texts that were at NAPI options, and added them 
to all NAPI options.
