Quoting from your report:
==> Mar  1 13:35:44 midway kernel: Oops: 0002
This means oops counter is 2. So there were two oopses before with
counter value 0 and 1.
> As for closing bug reports because they are not reproducible...
No. Not because it's not reproducible however because it's untrustable
and bogus. Unless as I mentioned before ... please see above. Thanks!
