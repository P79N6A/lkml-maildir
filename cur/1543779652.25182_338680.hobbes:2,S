How about something like:
	if (current + THREAD_SIZE/sizeof(long) - (regs + sizeof(pt_regs)) > MAGIC)
The idea is that an interrupt from user space will be the ONLY thing on 
the stack while an interrupt from the kernel will have kernel stack 
under it.  Current is the bottom end of the kernel stack and regs + 
sizeof(pt_regs) is where the interrupt context started.  Assumptions a) 
stack grows down, b) no switch stack at interrupt.
MAGIC is some small number.  For x86 user it is actually zero, don't 
know about others but the saved context should be the first thing on the 
stack so a minimun frame size should do.
