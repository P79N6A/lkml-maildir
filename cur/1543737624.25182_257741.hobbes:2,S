I still need to enable 4k stacks to get it to build [see error below w/o 4k
stacks].
But xrun hell is no more [as opposed to S8 and S9]. jackd seems to run fine
again. I suspect the reverted scheduler changes to have fixed this
[uneducated guess], since in S8 and S9 the system behaved all different
[sloppy X when compiling stuff. jackd producing xruns although everything is
setup for ll ok].
