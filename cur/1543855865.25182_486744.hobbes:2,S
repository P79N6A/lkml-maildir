Hi Robert,
I never resolved the problem. I turned on the excessive debugging output, but it 
didn't print out info about receiving packets or interrupts. My test 
app claimed there were no packets received although the bus analyzer 
showed lots of packets going by.  
If I can help out, let me know, but I'm not sure where to start at this point.
Keith

Subject: isochronous receives?
Keith, et. al,
I am having problems with isochronous receives, and remembered just as
I was getting ready to dig into the source that there was a message
about this stuff.  Lo and behold your message to linux1394-user from
September 7:

Did you ultimately have any success getting this going?  Funnily
enough, when I tested isochronous stuff in July, I just did iso
transmit since I figured receives *must* be working since everyone has
camcorders and whatnot.  My currently my iso xmit stuff does appear to
be working, but iso receives are not.
I have a Firespy and no reason not to trust it, so I can see the junk
I'm spewing out.  I've tried transmitting on channels 4 and 63 (per
your advice), but neither works for me.  I suppose it could my
stuff... nah.
