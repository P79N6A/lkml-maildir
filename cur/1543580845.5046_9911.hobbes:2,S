I found another workaround:
8390.c currently calls
	outb_p(ENISR_ALL, e8390_base + EN0_IMR);
	enable_irq(dev->irq);
and locks up after ~ 100 packets flood ping.
If I reorder these calls to
	enable_irq(dev->irq);
	outb_p(ENISR_ALL, e8390_base + EN0_IMR);
	(and the correct spin_lock()'s)
the lockup disappears.
But I have no idea how io_apic.c could prevent lockups.
Playing with the trigger mode is not 100% reliable - I assume it kicks
the io apic only after several changes of the trigger mode bit. Maciej's
patch switches that bit twice during every start_tx operation and thus
doesn't lock up, my patch touches the redirection entry exactly once and
reliably locks up - even if I change trigger mode, polarity, delivery
mode and vector during enable_level_irq().
Any ideas?
