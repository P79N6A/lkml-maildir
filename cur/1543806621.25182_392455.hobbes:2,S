Subject: [PATCH] AMD64: fix mce_cpu_quirks typos
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/2/1/330

The spurious MCE is TLB-related.  I *think* the bit for the correct
status code is stored at position 10 HEX, not 10 DEC.  At least I
still get those MCEs on a two-way Opteron box, even though they are
supposed to be filtered out.
