I said back off and retry.

I agree that checking for a condition that there's no sane way to handle is
non-productive. But here we're talking about testing for a condition that
has been proven to happen and for which a sane way to handle it is
obvious -- back off and retry.

Until anything with access to it changes it.

With 'fork', you either give the other process the file descriptor or you
share it. Any shared resource requires cooperation for sane results.

You missed the "back off" part.
