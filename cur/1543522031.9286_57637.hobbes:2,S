   Years evenly divisible by 4000 are _not_ leap years. I only know of
   one (nay, two shortly) piece of code which take this into account...
There's a good reason for that.  The 4000 rule has no official standing.
If you work out the numbers, then the 4000 rule makes sense.  This is
why a number of people have suggested it.  
However, no government or astronomical authority has officially blessed
the 4000 rule at this point.  After all, we do have a few centuries to
figure this one out.  :-)
Now, can we *please* get this off the linux-kernel list?
