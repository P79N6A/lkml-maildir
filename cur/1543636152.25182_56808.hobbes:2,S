No, but you do do firmware, and you have a desire to tell the kernel about 
which devices are in the system from the firmware. The code path once you 
discover the device is exactly the same as if you were to actually plug 
in the device, or probe for it natively.
Though making legacy drivers hotpluggable seems absurd, the capability is 
actually a requirement for supporting many firmwares.

Don't most people? :)

We don't want to make things difficult. It's a PITA right now, since the 
documentation is lacking and not all the infrastructure is in place to 
really start plowing ahead. But, it will get better..
