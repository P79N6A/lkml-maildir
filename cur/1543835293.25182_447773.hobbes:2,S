Argh, sorry, thanks for the fix.
It'd be great if we could deprecate subtree checking some day in the
distant future....
Would it be feasible to add filesystem support for some sort of
subvolume-like thing that acted like a mountpoint (in the sense that it
restricted hardlinks and renames) but that didn't require setting aside
a separate partition?  I imagine that'd probably do what most people
exporting subtrees want without forcing us to do dubious tricks with
filehandles.
