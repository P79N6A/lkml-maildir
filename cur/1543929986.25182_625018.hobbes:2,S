hi
I am about to modify kernel and do some work on it for the sake of
learning the code and contribute to the code when I am well versed
with it. I would like to know if there is any other way of downloading
the source code other than git. I am well acquainted with subversion
so I am wondering whether a subversion repository is available? If
none of this is available, at least a tarball that I can download
using my browser?
