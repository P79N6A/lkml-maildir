Compliance is a term used in contexts such as "standards" compliance.
Even "self compliance" is given, the Linux manpage matches observed
behavior, too.
Fact however is that I approached you with a patch that moved the
allocation into root-mode code, and later with a patch that reset
RLIMIT_MEMLOCK to RLIM_INFINITY, and we tested several variants forth
and back until you settled for raising RLIMIT_MEMLOCK to some 6 MB.

Which was not at all my point, but "compliance" is. I don't mind you
calling it workaround or call 2.6.9 incompatible with 2.6.8.1.
Re-read my message - and I find it interesting to read this NOW, after
I'd mailed this and discussed this earlier.
