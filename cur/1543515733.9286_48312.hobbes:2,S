drivers/i2o/i2o.a(i2o_lan.o): In function `i2o_lan_close':
i2o_lan.o(.text+0xa4c): undefined reference to `i2o_event_register'
such a critter doesn't exist in the kernel tree.
//#if 0
   struct i2o_controller *iop = i2o_dev->controller;
   if (i2o_event_register(iop, i2o_dev->lct_data->tid,
            priv->unit << 16 | lan_context, 0) < 0)
      printk(KERN_WARNING "%s: Unable to clear the event mask.\n",
            dev->name);
//#endif
above in the code, another reference to i20_event_register is avoided
with #if 0.
can someone fill me in?
