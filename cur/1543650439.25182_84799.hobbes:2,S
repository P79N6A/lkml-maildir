#1 I'll be reviewing initramfs and adding loading image from
the kernel support. I don't deny it's a godo thig to have.
#2 My main bitch at jeff was he said if initramfs goes in
initrd comes out. initrd shodul not come out.
My patch is the best of both because

My patch supports this (well it can be in about 5 lines of code)
Right now for backwards compatiblity I have a
initrd_from_floppy option (which replaces load_ramdisk=).
I was debating changing that to initrd_from= and then you can
spec /dev/fd0, /dev/fd1, or in your case a memory device linux
understandings.
But I mostly dimissed it because that is the job of the
boot loader....but you bring up a good point where it
could be used.
