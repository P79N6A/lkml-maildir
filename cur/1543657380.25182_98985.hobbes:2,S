  again, with 2.4.21-pre2, i plugged in my sharp zaurus 5500 into
a USB port and, while /var/log/messages and /proc/bus/usb/devices
both recognized it right away (yippee!), the interface that was
associated with this was not usb0 (as i expected), but eth1
instead:
Dec 30 13:31:07 dell kernel: hub.c: new USB device 00:1f.2-1, assigned address 5
Dec 30 13:31:07 dell kernel: CDCEther.c: eth1: Sharp SL Series 
Dec 30 13:31:07 dell /etc/hotplug/net.agent: invoke ifup eth1
Dec 30 13:31:10 dell /etc/hotplug/usb.agent: Setup acm CDCEther usbnet for USB product 4dd/8004/0
  should i have expected this?
