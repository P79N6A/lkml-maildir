The thing to which I refer is in Linus's tree but wasn't in yours this
morning.  Unfortunately, this means my patch has to be different, depending on
whose tree I'm using... although your tree has been updated since then, so the
difference seems to have gone away.
I don't mean to be critical of your efforts, but the requirement imposed by
Andrew that I have to base my tree on yours makes things a little tricky
sometimes:-/
