start_thread() doesnt do what one would intuitively think it does.
start_thread() simply prepares the new task's register set to be ready to
start user-space (which task is the current task as well, so certain
current CPU registers might have to be manually bootstrapped as well), but
start_thread() does not actually start execution of user-space code yet.
(a more correct name for start_thread() would be prepare_user_thread().)

execution starts when the process returns from sys_execve(). By that time
we have already changed pagetables and other context information, dropped
basically everything from the previous context - without actually doing a
context-switch. In fact sys_execve() has an implicit context-switch,
without ever changing the kernel-stack though.

this is how it happens on x86 too. Basically you start the new binary by
returning from an syscall that has bootstrapped all userspace context -
this approach should work on any architecture. (because every architecture
has to be able to execute user-space code after syscalls.)
