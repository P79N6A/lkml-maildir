It depends which choice the distributor chooses regarding section three
of the GPL.
If he chooses 3b ("written offer, valid for at least three years, to
give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically
performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the
corresponding source code") he has to give it to everyone.
You are right for 3a (source shipped together with the binaries) and 3c 
(noncommercial redistribution of binaries received under 3b).
