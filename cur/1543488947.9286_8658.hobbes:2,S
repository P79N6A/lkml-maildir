In my experience, the fix for this particular problem is to recompile
the lxdialog utility used by menuconfig - something like the following
command sequence, but I'm sure Michael will correct me...
 Q> cd scripts/lxdialog
 Q> rm -f *.o
 Q> make all
 Q> cd ../..
 Q> make menuconfig
Best wishes from Riley.
