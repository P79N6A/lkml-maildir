Hi Andrew,
Here's a cosmetic patch for IB/mthca. Pls drop it into -mm and on.
---
comment in mthca_qp.c makes it seem lockdep is the only reason WQ locks should
be initialized separately, but as Zach Brown and Roland pointed out, there are
other reasons, e.g. that mthca_wq_init is called from modify qp as well.
