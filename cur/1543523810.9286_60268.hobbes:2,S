Your test is wrong because the particular `leal' instructions you use
are dependent.  The delay you are seeing is due to pipeline scheduling,
not the instruction by itself.  If you use the instruction in a
different context, you will find it is fast.
There's a section on Address Generation Interlock stalls which affects
Pentiums and 486s.  See _any_ 486 or Pentium optimisation book...  AGI
is an important scheduling detail.  I think modern GCC knows about it
and schedules accordingly.  Certainly, PGCC does.

On a 486, try writing
	leal 2(%eax),%eax
	leal 2(%ebx),%ebx
	leal 2(%eax),%eax
	leal 2(%ebx),%ebx
etc. instead.
On a Pentium, try writing
	leal 2(%eax),%eax
	leal 2(%ebx),%ebx
	leal 2(%ecx),%ecx
	leal 2(%edx),%edx
	leal 2(%eax),%eax
	leal 2(%ebx),%ebx
	leal 2(%ecx),%ecx
	leal 2(%edx),%edx
instead.  Then go and read about AGIs.
You're right that `leal' is not always faster than `addl', because
`addl' doesn't have the AGI stall.  But it does depend on context.
I think you should still apologise to Alan anyway :-)
And Alan should apologise for being so terse, because it does depend on
context and he didn't say so :-)
have a nice day
