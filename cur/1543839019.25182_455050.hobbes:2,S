'function correctly' ?
As what?
I've bought a number of devices that I know will not have all the
advertised features available to me, because I install a different
version of linux on them.
It functions correctly, as delivered.
With the appropriate disclaimers on the box, it cannot function
incorrectly, as you will know that the  thumb-print reader won't
work if you upgrade the kernel, and if you intend to do so,
you don't buy.
I've got a number of wireless routers that I don't have working
drivers for the wifi cards, happily wired into my network doing
things that they were not intended for, but they are functioning
'correctly' as I see it.
