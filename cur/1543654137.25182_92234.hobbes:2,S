Ah yes. This is a known problem, though I do apologize for the rudeness in
the Oops. You're going to have to increment the module count whenever a 
noisy probe is registered. There is no automatic correlation between the 
subsystem refcount and the module refcount. Because that is true, there 
are some races involved between adding a probe and the module being 
unloaded. 
I recently changed the device driver mechanism for handling this. Each
driver has a semaphore that is locked when the driver is registered, and
unlocked only when the refcount reaches 0.  driver_unregister() decrements
the refcount, then waits to take the lock. If there are any users, rmmod
will block until they go away. You can try an approach like that, though 
it may not be what you want. You might just want to remove all the probes 
when someone does rmmod..
