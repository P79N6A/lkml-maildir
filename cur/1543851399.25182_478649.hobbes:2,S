True, it would help with keeping the machine in an alive state.
But when one task is allocating memory, it's still going to be pushing
out pages with random owners, rather than pushing out its own pages
when it hits it memory limit. That can negatively affect the
performance of other tasks, which is what we're trying to prevent.
You can't just say that the biggest user should get penalised. You
might want to use 75% of a machine for an important production server,
and have the remaining 25% available for random batch jobs - they
shouldn't be able to impact the production server.
