Yes, I also like the sticky bit proposal. But immutable removes much of
the advantages again (nsf/cp/tar stop working). Much better is that writing
to a sticky file just removes the sticky bit except if the entity writing
has CAPSETCAP. Notice that this is also the way we handle suid-ness, which has
exactly the same problem (we don't want someone to write to suid either) and
of which we know it's a working method.
For the same reason I think it's good to introduce a nosticky mount option in
a capabilities kernel, where nosticky is even the default. Once you 
audited a filesystem, you can mount it as sticky, so the sticky bits will
have their effect. That solves much of the problem of moving from a non-cap
to a cap kernel.
It also allows things to work in a mixed environment with mounts from
untrusted places. Or user floppy mounts/cd mounts and stuff like that.
This scheme to me seems to solve almost all problems really.
