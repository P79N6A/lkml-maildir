Hmm, here is a brief policy statement on crypto in Canada.  I know that this
in not the US, but Canadian and US policies follow each other closely in
military matters, due to various mutual defence agreements.  From this, it
is clear that most legal issues regarding the use/development of crypto has
been dropped in North America.  This makes sense, since it is far easier to
gather intelligence by other means than by decrypting computer data.
Instead of worrying about US law, you should now worry about
French/Chinese/Russian law instead...

SUMMARY OF CANADA'S CRYPTOGRAPHY POLICY
BACKGROUNDER
The Government is implementing a cryptography policy that:
encourages the growth of electronic commerce;
allows Canadian producers to export their products globally within the
framework of international arrangements; and
contains measures to maintain the capability of law enforcement agencies to
ensure public safety.
Support for Electronic Commerce
Canadians are free to develop, import and use whatever cryptography products
they wish.
The Government will not implement mandatory key recovery requirements or
licensing regimes.
The Government encourages industry to establish responsible practices, such
as key recovery techniques for stored data.
The Government will act as a model user of cryptography through the
practices of the Government of Canada Public Key Infrastructure (GOC PKI).
The Government encourages and supports industry-led accreditation of private
sector certification authorities.
Export / International Agreements
Canada will continue to implement cryptography export controls in keeping
with the framework of the international Wassenaar Arrangement.
Canada will take into consideration the export practices of other countries
and the availability of comparable products when rendering export permit
decisions.
The export permit application process will be made more transparent and
procedures will be streamlined to ensure the least regulatory intervention
necessary.
Public Safety
The Government proposes amendments to the Criminal Code and other statutes
as necessary to:
criminalize the wrongful disclosure of keys;
deter the use of encryption in the commission of a crime;
deter the use of cryptography to conceal evidence;
apply existing interception, search and seizure and assistance procedures to
cryptographic situations and circumstances.
