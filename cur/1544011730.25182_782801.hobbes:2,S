Aah, so you are saying that the buffer_size file (or whatever it was called)
is part of the ring buffer user API, and not tracing user API?
But the ring buffer is just a buffer, is it meaningful to adjust a ring
buffer size? I cannot tell tracing to go use a different buffer. And if
there will be other users of ring buffers, they would probably want to
have their own control over the buffer size.
As a user, I want to adjust *the* tracing ring buffer size, not some ring
buffer size.
Am I making any sense? I'm trying to say that in my opinion, the
buffer_size file does not belong to the "ring buffer" level. The upper
levels should decide whether and how it offers buffer resizing.
