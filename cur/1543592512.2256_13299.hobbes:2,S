I think I found the real thinko for the create_buffers other deadlock
experienced by Ben, I suspect this fix is enough to address the
deadlock, this was real bug not just hiding factor (reserved bh aren't
released by irqs, the bounces frees memory, memory balancing stop, no bh
is released and we dealdock in wait_event), I also increased a bit the
reserved bh just in case:

please people with >1G machines try to reproduce the deadlock with
cerberus on top of 2.4.5 + the above patch.
I didn't checked the alloc_pages() other thing mentioned by Ben, if
alloc_pages() deadlocks internally that's yet another completly
orthogonal bug and that will be addressed by another patch if it
persists.
