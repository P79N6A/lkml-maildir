From a legal standpoint, perhaps you're right, it doesn't matter what
the function is. From a moral standpoint it should be obvious to you
that "runs on TiVO" is TiVO's sole motivation to distribute the
software at all, it is "the software" and arguing that they have an
equivalent obligation WRT it as to some incidental thing like Linus'
signing key is just preposterous.

No, in this case you are wrong because absent authority to decide the
meaning from a dispositive legal standpoint (the law says the license
means this) or knowledge of the intent of the author of the GPL (I the
author intended it to mean this), your statement that the GPL was
"never about" "such decisions" is meaningless, AFAICT.
