Yes there are bleeding edge systems that fail without this patch.
And I have them.  That is why I wrote the code.
I do agree that find_isa_irq_pin is a suboptimal way to get this
information, looking at the ioapics at boot time would be better.
However it works for me, the code is not wrong, and as you said
usually the code becomes a noop. 
If I can find the appropriate place in the boot path to examine
the ioapics before they get stomped I am more than willing to write
code that will handle this even in the presence of acpi data.
In addition this code is not a complete noop because when
find_isa_irq_pin fails it does put the local apic in virtual wire mode.
