I have recently compiled a 2.2.14 kernel with Hedrick's ide patch in an 
attempt to get my Promise card working.  Linux recognizes the card and all 
disks attached, then hangs:
Uniform Multi-Platform E-IDE Driver Revision: 6.30
PIIX4: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev 39
PIIX4: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later
	Ide1: BM-DMA at 0x1428-0x142f, BIOS settings: hdc: DMA hdd: pio
PDC20262: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev 78
PDC20262: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later
PDC20262: (U) DMA Burst Bit ENABLED Primary PCI Mode Secondary PCI Mode
	Ide2: BM-DMA at 0x10c0-0x10c7, BIOS settings: hde:pio, hdf: pio
	Ide3: BM-DMA at 0x10c8-0x10cf, BIOS settings: hdg: pio, hdh: pio
hdc: TOSHIBA DVD-ROM SD-M1212, ATAPI CD-ROM drive
hdd: IOMEGA ZIP100 ATAPI, ATAPI FLOPPY drive
hde: QUANTUM FIREBALLP KX13.6, ATA DISK drive
ide1 at 0x170-0x177, 0x376 on irq 15
ide3 at 0x1440-0x1447, 0x1436 on irq 10
here the kernel hangs and my system locks.  The same thing happens with the 
patched 2.2.13 and 2.2.14 kernels.  Is this a specific problem related to 
the Quantum/Promise combination?  I've read of some similar issues, but no 
one I know of seems to have this worked out yet (I suppose it's a rather 
specific problem).  It would be much appreciated if any replies could be 
CC'ed to my email address, as I don't currently subscribe to this list, 
although I've sifted through a good year worth of archives searching for a 
solution.
Thanks,
Justin Ward
