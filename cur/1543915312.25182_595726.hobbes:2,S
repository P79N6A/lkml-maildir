I found this thread: 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/5/16/499
but it doesn't seem to apply here (bear in mind that I'm probably
not qualified to determine that though :))
On booting a 2.6.22.6 kernel with SMP support, I get a panic
immediately:
  PANIC: CPU too old for this kernel
This panic does not occur on a non-SMP kernel having almost
identical configuration.
This is on a Thinkpad T41:
  /proc/cpuinfo --> 
http://rlworkman.net/cpuinfo
  dmesg --> 
http://rlworkman.net/dmesg
  kernel config --> 
http://rlworkman.net/config-2.6.22.6
The 2.6.21.5 SMP kernels from Slackware 12.0 all boot properly, and
the config for this 2.6.22.6 SMP kernel is based on the one from 12.0.
I'm basically reaching for clues at this point -- is this a PEBKAC on
my part?  What other information would be useful?
