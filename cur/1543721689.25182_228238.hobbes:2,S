Hi,
I recently upgraded from 2.4 to kernel 2.6 & noticed that the zoltrix
radio driver was not working.  Seems like a little typo.
I tested this on my system and it's working fine now. I doubt there are
any other linux users in the world who still use this card ;-)
This is my first patch.  I tried following the guidelines as stated here
:

If I forgot something, don't hesitate to contact me.
