Sounds like it's due to the "b_committed_data" avoidance code.  Ext3
cannot immediately reuse disk space after a delete, because of lazy
writeback --- until the final writeback of the delete hits disk, we have
to be able to undo it.  And because in non-data-journaled modes we allow
new disk writes to hit disk before a transaction commit, that means we
can't reuse deleted blocks until after they are committed.
I've never seen it reported as a problem outside of artificial test
scenarios, but if it is something we need to address, Andreas Dilger's
patch looks good.
Cheers,
 Stephen
