How about the following?
000001f0 <_spin_lock_irqsave>:
 1f0:   55                      push   %ebp
 1f1:   89 e5                   mov    %esp,%ebp
 1f3:   56                      push   %esi
 1f4:   89 c6                   mov    %eax,%esi
 1f6:   53                      push   %ebx
 1f7:   51                      push   %ecx
 1f8:   51                      push   %ecx
 1f9:   9c                      pushf
 1fa:   5b                      pop    %ebx
 1fb:   fa                      cli
 1fc:   b8 00 e0 ff ff          mov    $0xffffe000,%eax
 201:   21 e0                   and    %esp,%eax
 203:   8b 50 14                mov    0x14(%eax),%edx
 206:   42                      inc    %edx
It was a lot easier with the spin stub only out of line (the first round
of patches for i386, x86_64) so there i used esp and didn't depend on
frame pointers.
Thanks,
