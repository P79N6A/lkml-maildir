sysctl_lower_zone_protection is an inferior implementation of the
lower_zone_reserve_ratio, inferior because it has no way to give a
different balance to each zone. As you said it's turned off by default
so it had no tuning. The lower_zone_reserve_ratio has already been
tuned in 2.4. Somebody can attempt a conversion but it'll never be equal
since lower_zone_reserve_ratio is a superset of what
sysctl_lower_zone_protection can do.
