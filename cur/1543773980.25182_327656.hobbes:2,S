Indeed. I've also tracked my problem down to the hid core which returns
-EIO when it fails to drive an unknown HID device, instead of a more
logical -ENODEV (this is not a failure to init a known device, but
rather the impossibility to init an unknown device).
The patch below solves the problem for me:

I agree, presence in /sys/devices shouldn't be related to the existence
or success/failure of a driver. The link between /sys/class
towards /sys/devices is already saying this.
