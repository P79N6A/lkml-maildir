Hi,
I had an Athlon 800MHz (chipset Via82... on motherboard) which got
burned.
I bought a Pentium 4 1.5 GHz with mother Intel D845WN.
When I try to boot the same linux I had installed, it simply reboots,
but I can install a new linux distribution (RH, Slackware, etc.).
Linux: Red-Hat 7.2 (well, ..... I wanted to be comfortable really
quickly),
       kernel 2.4.10 (default kernel, no recompilation made)
It reboots after writing:
"Uncompressing kernel .......................
OK, now booting the kernel" (or similar).
How may I find out what's wrong?  Is it possible to debug this problem?
Thank you very much in advance,
