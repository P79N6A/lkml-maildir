But that isn't the situation being discussed. You've sent this mail to the 
*LINUX* *KERNEL* ML, not the MadWifi ML. The patches in question were not 
accepted into the Linux Kernel, so this is *NOT* the place to send mail 
related to them.
*PLEASE* go do a Google search or check the MadWifi site for their discussion 
list/forum/whatever and complain there.

Yes, true, but you are attacking people who haven't done anything wrong. And 
by your own words, Mr. Roberts, OpenBSD has violated peoples 
copyrights: "Most of us are also aware of the instance where OpenBSD took 
some GPL code and replaced the license with BSD. What OpenBSD did in that 
cases was just as illegal,"
If the OpenBSD developers want to attack the Linux Kernel community over 
patches that were *NEVER* *ACCEPTED* by said community, it should be just as 
fair for the Linux Kernel community to complain about those (unspecified) 
times where OpenBSD replaced the GPL on code with the BSD license.
And, as said before, the place to take these complaints is the MadWifi 
discussion area, since they are, apparently, the only people that accepted 
the patches in question.

*WE*, the people on the Linux Kernel ML, *CANNOT* "fix the problem" with the 
*MADWIFI* code having accepted patches which violate Reyk's copyright.

Linux Kernel != FSF/GNU
If it was then RMS would not be attacking Linus and Linux with faulty claims 
just because Linus has publicly stated that the GPLv2 is a better license 
than v3 and because Linux cannot, for numerous reasons, ever be released 
under the GPLv3.
I repeat - Linux has *NOT* and will *NEVER* accept the patches in question. If 
somebody else has, then go and yell at them about it. The developers here, on 
the LINUX KERNEL MAILING LIST, have no control or authority (in general) over 
projects such as MadWifi. If they have accepted the faulty patches - and said 
patches are now part of their code-base, then go tell them about it and make 
sure Theo gets the message.
