If the only effect of an unnecessaryly enabled option are a few kB 
wasted space, this isn't a big problem in most situations.
If it's easy to accidentially disable an important option, it's good to 
protect users against doing so.
People who _really_ need the space simply enable EMBEDDED to disable 
such an option.
