   2.4.x supports SSE on pentium III/athlons, so the SSE registers need to be
   saved/restored on a taskswitch as well.... that's not exactly free.
lat_ctx doesn't execute any FPU ops.  So at worst this happens once
on GLIBC program startup, but then never again.
This assumes I understand how lazy i387 restores work in the kernel
:-)
Franks a lot,
