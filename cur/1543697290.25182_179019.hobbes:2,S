I was thinking of teaching the fault handlers to complain about
->nopage() methods returning invalid results in a non-fatal manner,
possibly with code consolidation.
e.g. every arch does:
	switch (handle_mm_fault(...)) {
		case VM_FAULT_MINOR:
			tsk->min_flt++;
			break;
		case VM_FAULT_MAJOR:
			tsk->maj_flt++;
			break;
		case VM_FAULT_SIGBUS:
			goto do_sigbus;
		case VM_FAULT_OOM:
			goto out_of_memory;
		default:
			BUG();
	}
which is vaguely repetitive. It's not immediately clear how to
consolidate gotos, which is where the thought starts happening.
The other part was replacing default: BUG() with something that
complained (e.g. putting print_symbol() to use on the ->nopage()
method) and treating the invalid statuses like OOM, but that's
not really very hard to do (I posted something that did some
crude reporting of that kind already to handle the sound/ bogons).
