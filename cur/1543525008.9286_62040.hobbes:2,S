Huh?  I've never had a piece of code rejected due to my race, gender, religion,
sexual preference, bank account contents, or the company where I am employed.
I _have_ however had code rejected for being broken, poorly documented,
insufficiently granular, and I've even had code rejected for being well
implemented but philosophically wrong.  The philosophically wrong stuff is
harder emotionally, but after a bit of a flame fest where everybody explains to
everyone else why the code is or is not wrong, the right thing happens.  
I'm afraid I've failed to see where Alan and/or Linus played politics.
