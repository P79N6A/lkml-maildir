If you consider a "faulty machine" a development one, then yes, I have one. I
have glibc-2.2.5 gcc-3.1 linux-2.5.23, but that shouldn't matter I want to know
what's causing this and I'll like to fix it.
I'm pretty sure this started with linux-2.5.19, might be it has something to do
with forking, might be it's a make bug, but I think something is wrong here.
