I remeber the O(1) scheduler from Davide Libenzi was beating the mainline O(N)
scheduler with over 7 tasks in the runqueue (actually I'm not sure if the
number was 7 but certainly it was under 10). So if you also use a O(1)
scheduler too as I guess (since you have a chance to run fast on the lots of
tasks running case) the most interesting thing is how you score with 2/4/8
tasks in the runqueue (I think the tests on the O(1) scheduler patch was done
at max on a 2-way SMP btw). (the argument for which Davide's patch wasn't
included is that most machines have less than 4/5 tasks in the runqueue at the
same time)
