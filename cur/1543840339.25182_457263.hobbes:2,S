I just wanted to mention that I also have had this problem with tg3 on my Dell 
Optiplex 280.  Here's my dmesg info:
> tg3.c:v3.59 (June 8, 2006)
> ACPI: PCI Interrupt 0000:02:00.0[A] -> GSI 16 (level, low) -> IRQ 16
> PCI: Setting latency timer of device 0000:02:00.0 to 64

> 10/100/1000BaseT E thernet 00:12:3f:4d:a5:bd

> TSOcap[1] eth0: dma_rwctrl[76180000] dma_mask[64-bit]
I wasn't sure if BCM95751 was covered by "5780 class chips".
The problem didn't show up for >3 days after I upgraded to 2.6.17 
(Gentoo-sources, 2.6.17-r4 to be exact).  Problem was most evident during 
bittorrent download.  Setting TSO to off seems have solved it.  If there's 
any other information you'd like from me, please let me know.
Thanks,
Mike
