This is broken. Since it has VM_MAYWRITE, a subsequent mprotect() may
mark it writable, and you you went boom.
If you really want a shared mapping, you'd better open with O_RDONLY, at
which point the existing code should be perfectly happy and does the
right thing.
In other words: the code is correct as-is.
