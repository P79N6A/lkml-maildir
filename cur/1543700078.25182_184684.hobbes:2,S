Well if a kobject only uses the .name field, .k_name will point to it
(see kobject_add()), so the kobject_name() call will work in the above
case (as it should always do.)  Actually that if (p->k_name) statement
will always be true because of this fact :)
This lets people like the edd driver which does:
	 snprintf(edev->kobj.name, EDD_DEVICE_NAME_SIZE, "int13_dev%02x", edd[i].device);
still work properly.  Ideally, callers like this should change to use
the kobject_set_name() function, but there's no rush.
