Thanks for the information. I am on-and-off experimenting with
goldmemory and memtester86+ to see if I can find something with more
than 512MB that is stable.
I am, right now, using 512MB + 256MB slowed down to PC100 speeds. It
seems to be stable with this configuration (having survived some memory
tests, the decoding of lots of FLAC files in a row and using the machine
as usual---with low consumption things like mutt and browsing with
lynx).

The thing is that any stick alone doesn't seem to generate a problem.
Only when they are used simultaneously
I will test it more to see what may be wrong with my setup. :-( I still
have not isolated and understood the problem completely. :-(
Thanks for the feedback, Rogério.
