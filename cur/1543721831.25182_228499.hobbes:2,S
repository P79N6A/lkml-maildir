Is printk ever used to send anything out via a serial link? I assumed it
was only kernel log messages (that should really be fairly sane). Log
messages sent to serial printer, etc, don't want dodgy chars in them
that may mess up the printer, do they?

Looking at the ACPI code (and not understanding it too well) it looks
like this data is retrieved from the BIOS, but is only printed here for
info and not actually used anywhere. In this case, I'd think there isn't
a lot of point checking for data correctness in the ACPI code. As
someone else pointed out, though, other things can cause the kernel log
to print nasty chars that are unwanted, so there should really be a
check here anyway.

The string has just been through the equivalent of sprintf, so I guess
this is hardly going to slow it down much more. Used p[0] to look
tidier, matching another "if" statement 5 lines up. In new patch used
*p, as it doesn't really matter.
