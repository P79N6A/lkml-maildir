Yeah, I use 2.2.19 on my server (2.4.x is the most unstable 'stable series' i've ever seen..). ipchains is like this:
Incoming                                                 Outgoing
interface                                                interface
  ----+                                             +------->
      |                                             ^
      v   +------------> forward -----------+      |
    input |                                 |----> output
          +----------> Application ---------+
I actually like it that way, it makes it easier to block things from the dsl ether (eth0):
ipchains -a input -i eth0 -d ! 66.92.237.176 -j DENY -l
With iptables i'd need that on both the INPUT *and* FORWARD rules...
