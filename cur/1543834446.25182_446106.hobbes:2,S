From what I've seen from our customers, that never happens. Yes, there
are sometimes people with a million inodes in use, and we've seen four
million once, but that's never been a problem, even not with a huge
mail server with thousands of users having mailboxes in maildir format.
We usually limit our own filesystems to 12 million inodes and it's
never been a problem to store files from our customers.

Not a problem anymore with htree dirextory indexing. If it's not yet
enabled (dumpe2fs the filesystem and look for the "dir_index" feature),
enable it with:
  tune2fs -O dir_index /dev/whatever
After the next mount the filesystem will use it for new directories. To
optimize existing directories, run e2fsck -D.
