That is a poor name to choose given /proc/self/task exists as something
else (just try writing a sentence comparing them and then read it aloud).
Probably /proc/self/task/self is what makes the most sense structurally.
I don't know if it matters to whatever use you are concerned with to have
two more steps in the lookup.
Thanks,
Roland
