Note that early versions of the XFree86 synaptics driver had a bug
that could make the X server lock up. I'm not sure if this has
anything to do with your problem, but I have seen at least one lockup
report on the list that turned out to be caused by this bug.
The bug was fixed in version 0.11.3p5.
