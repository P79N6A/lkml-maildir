I would also argue that adding in an ordered way is better than
at random positions, that is if the list is ordered to start with.
As long as everyone follows the same order, you will get (desired)
conflicts in case two people try to add the same line, and when
the added lines are different, it's as good as random ordering
to avoid undesired merge conflicts.
