Quite possibly it's triggering (or is triggered by) some other bug. 
There is also a possibility that raw1394.c might be doing something
wrong and gets away with it with the changed ordering. Because dv1394.c
does it the "seemingly-bad" way and I haven't got rmmod to hang while
removing it.
Can anyone answer this - in what  cases will generic_delete_inode hang
on __down_failed -> default_wake_function -> __down?
Thanks
Parag
