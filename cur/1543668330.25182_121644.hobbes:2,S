i'm pretty sure that, if you just unpacked the source for the
first time, you should first "make mrproper" just to play it
safe, and after that, you *must* do at least one full config
of some kind, to create a number of header files that are
necessary.  the fact that you said you did a "make menuconfig",
but bailed before you actually saved anything makes me uneasy.
and the INTEL_RNG has something to do with random number
generation.  but can you do a "make oldconfig" and see if
you get the same error?
