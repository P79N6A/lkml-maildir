No, this is not an approiate comparison. You are intentionally confusing
the issues.
Some attacks are simply NOT possible with the patch, sometimes the binary
does not contain any useful exploitable code.
I give up. This is stupid. 
The only reason I ever wanted the patch in the standard kernel is that
it's the only way to insure that it will remain compatible.
It would be a better use of my time to port the patch to 2.3.x then to
continue pounding on this issue.
