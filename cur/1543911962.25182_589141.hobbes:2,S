FYI to linux-pci folks
This patch had previous discussion on LKML:
    
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/8/17/336
James Bottomley at one point obliquely referred to
my OLS2003 paper: "DMA Hints on ia64/PARISC"
After reading the thread, my take is we need a more elegant way for a
device driver to handle registration of DMA regions allocated by user
space. The API would "make this page/region act like dma_alloc_coherent()".
That implies strong ordering between CPU and DMA to/from the device.
Maybe the code is the right thing and I want a name that makes
sense in the context of current DMA API.
On IRC, willy suggested an mmap() flag and that sounds reasonable too
though I don't know if it's feasible.
