Ah ! you said the word: "virtualize".

hacking the syscall table via a module is evil and does not work. You can't
hack pids in a signal siginfo that way, you won't support NPTL, etc.

Indeed. Did you ever think about using PAGG as a foundation for a
checkpoint/restart container ?
Aggregation and isolation are key requirements for checkpoint/restart. And
then, the next one that comes on the list is private namespace or
virtualization, depends how you call it :)
