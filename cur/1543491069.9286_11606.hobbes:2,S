Unless anyone screams too loudly this will become 2.0.37. It should now pass
the JDK multicast tests and generally behave. There are still a couple of
long standing TCP fringe cases I have patches for that are not in 2.0.37.
That is intentional, I'm holding a few patches back for 2.0.38 so that they
can get a long run in when testing.
You need binutils 2.8 or 2.9 to build this kernel tree. 2.7 is not good
enough
