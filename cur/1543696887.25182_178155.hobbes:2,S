I'd really suggest to run DM (either LVM2 or EVMS2) on top of md
instead. It's much more flexible; I don't see any benefit in 'old style'
partition information, which has all sorts of problems - ie,
non-transactional updates (_why_ were you running raid again? ;), static
as they can't be modified during runtime etc.
