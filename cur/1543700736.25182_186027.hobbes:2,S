Thanks, I mmified that.  It let me drop a shower of other stuff, which is
always welcome.  Please send in new versions as-and-when needed.
I dropped all of kgdboe:
	kgdb-over-ethernet.patch
	kgdb-over-ethernet-fixes.patch
	kgdb-CONFIG_NET_POLL_CONTROLLER.patch
	kgdb-handle-stopped-NICs.patch
	eepro100-poll-controller.patch
	tlan-poll_controller.patch
	tulip-poll_controller.patch
	tg3-poll_controller.patch
	8139too-poll_controller.patch
	kgdb-eth-smp-fix.patch
	kgdb-eth-reattach.patch
	kgdb-skb_reserve-fix.patch
Matt, would you be able to take a look at resurrecting kgdboe based on the
netpoll infrastructure sometime please?
George, I'm sorely tempted to fold all of these:
	kgdb-buff-too-big.patch
	kgdb-warning-fix.patch
	kgdb-build-fix.patch
	kgdb-spinlock-fix.patch
	kgdb-fix-debug-info.patch
	kgdb-cpumask_t.patch
	kgdb-x86_64-fixes.patch
into the base kgdb patch.   Beware ;)
