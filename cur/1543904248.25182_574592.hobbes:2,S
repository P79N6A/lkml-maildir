So do I. Of course, I certainly miss most of the details, but I can't
imagine how this yesterday Ingo's patch couldn't work - unless
Marcin's test wasn't long enough...
IMHO, the main problem is that such delicate things shouldn't be
changed this way. If current ideas work for Marcin they will probably
break other boxes. Very similar symptoms were reported before Ingo's
patch too, so it looks like this place is very fragile. If such
things could happen:

there is no reason to think this is all.
I can also see this comment in arch/x86_64/kernel/io_apic.c:

It seems somebody have seen a difference, probably after testing,
but it wasn't respected.
I also presume ne2k/lib8390.c solution could be a result of "real
life", and I don't think Marcin's tests can be enough here. 
So, my point is that such places first of all need some documented
knobs in config or elsewere, which make it possible for users to
easily go back to previous method (i.e. from 2.6.21 to 2.6.20 here).
