I used to think they were a great technique.  But in each case I
thought they could be applied, better schemes have come along.
In the case of the page cache we went to a per-address-space tree,
and here in the routing cache we went to RCU.
There are RCU patches around for the TCP hashes and I'd like to
put those in at some point as well.  In fact, they'd be even
more far reaching since Arnaldo abstracted away the socket
hashing stuff into an inet_hashtables subsystem.
