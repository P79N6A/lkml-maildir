You're welcome.
It works better, but it's not fixed.
  o Playing through oss directly works like before
  o No more scratchy sound on artsd startup.
  o Playing one song at a time through artsd works.
  o Giving two songs to ogg123 to play through artsd
    works until you Ctrl-C to skip to the next song.
    It then hangs (like before, but with no dmesg output)
Thanks,
-Jim
