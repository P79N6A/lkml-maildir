why cannot it be fixed?

we do not want to export HZ, why should we? HZ has no meaning to anything
else than the kernel. If the kernel exports HZ-dependent values into
/proc, then that has to be fixed. (yes it might be painful in some cases) 
HZ might even go away in future kernels - what if we start using
nonperiodic timer interrupts?
