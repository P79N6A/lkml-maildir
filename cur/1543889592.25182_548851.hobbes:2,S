DMI is somewhat broken with this old BIOS.
I checked the config space of the 82371SB(PII3). It seems that
my bios did not get the XCBS register right(4Eh): IRQ12/M
Mouse  function Enable is set to 0.
This bios is full of bugs, a real plague. Will try to quirk
this register at boot time.
Best regards,
Emmanuel.
