Hi,
I looked at some past kernel mailings and it seems like some archs need 
specific caches and others don't. In order to provide these 
functionalities I suggest to add somewhere to init/main.c
	misc_cache_init();
and provide an initial
	#define misc_cache_init() do {} while (0)
for every architecture.
Anyone agrees on this?
Frank.
