Hi Stelian,
Thanks for your bug report. Let me analyze it a bit:
> ds: no socket drivers loaded!
ds.o is loaded for the first time, but fails as the yenta-socket driver was 
not loaded before
> pcnet_cs: Unknown symbol pcmcia_unregister_driver
> pcnet_cs: Unknown symbol pcmcia_register_driver
This is strange. There is an EXPORT_SYMBOL(pcmcia_register_driver) ...
maybe gets away after a "make clean"... not worriesome, though; as the
loading continues.
> kobject pcmcia: registering. parent: <NULL>, set: bus
ds.o is loaded for the second time; and pcmcia_bus_type is to be added
again. Due to a bug in ds.c it didn't get unregistered in the failed loading
of ds.o - the attached patch should fix it. Could you please try it?
It is strange, though, that you nonetheless managed to get it to work with
"inadvertedly modified" timings...
Thanks,
	Dominik
