Subject: initrd generalization (remounting /) - possible & the Right  Thing(tm)?

how about making some generalization like initrd does - remounting / on a
running system?
initrd starts a program in /.
then you write to /proc/sys/kernel/real-root-dev and exit.
root gets remountet, and init is started.
how about something like /proc/sys/kernel/real-init and 
 - if root is unmounted, it is remounted with the given values
 - if system_halt is called with something like RELOAD_SYSTEM, root is
   remounted
this would be nice for setup-programs or maintenance-partitions - a running
server could be "reloaded" at night, tested for some criterias and reloaded
in a quick manner.
or: reload system from a ram-disk, repartition harddrive, reload from
harddrive. (which is not possible nowadays).
I know that this must be done in single-user-mode (or something similar).
regards,
phil
