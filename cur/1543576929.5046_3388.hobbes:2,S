The Oops occured during system idle time.  Nothing significant
was occuring on the machine.  The only thing I can think of is
that last night I used my CD burner with xcdroast for the first
time in 2.2.18.  xcdroast was still running when i saw the oops.
Netscape shows up in the Oops report, but Netscape was not
running when I found it.  The system was not hard locked, but was
able to shut down.  Upon rebooting, I had to mount read-only, and
do fsck manually (forced) on all fs's.  2 partitions had serious
problems /var/log, and /var/spool.  A lot of log files got
trashed in the process.
