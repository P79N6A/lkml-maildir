To be very safe, use a parameter and don't do probing, except to
verify that the device is where you have been told it is.

It could.

There's not a method that's always safe AFAIK.
It's better to use reads instead of writes if possible.
It's better to begin at the least-used addresses of other
known devices as much as possible (but you know that).
