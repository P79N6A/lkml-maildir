Thank you for doing that!

Why >= 0 ? ->prio is just integer, it can be < 0.

No, the head is not a node, and does not have ->prio field. It is easy
to get plist's priority:
	plist_empty(head) ? INT_MAX // or 0?
		: plist_last(head)->prio

This is right, but contradicts with 'each node has a >= 0 priority' above.
Actually I don't understand why should we talk about min/max at all.
plist is sorted by ->prio which is integer. That's all.

Both of them have 'void' return type.
