So "khelper_wq" should better be "helper_wq" too?
    khelper_wq = create_singlethread_workqueue("khelper");
'helper_wq' becomes [kthread] as shown in ps ax; I don't think it is a 'helper'.
    5 ?        S<     0:00 [khelper]
    6 ?        S<     0:00 [kthread]
That vague name makes me easily forget what I am looking at.  Please apply.
