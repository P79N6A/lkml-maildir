Well, that explains your viewpoint and your motivation. :-)

ALSA: driver work gets done twice
pcmcia-cs: this was so bad that Linus himself was unable to install

VMware: quite a pain I think
You are basically suggesting the often-rejected "split up the kernel"
idea. I think the linux-kernel FAQ covers this.

So people should only get kernels from linux vendors? This is great
for your business I'd imagine, but one of the nice things about Linux
is that you can replace the kernel without too much trouble.
