So fscking what?  _Nothing_ of the above warrants a new syscall.  There
are struct file * attributes and there are descriptor attributes.
Rather than excreting a new syscall you could look what already exists
in the API.
Frankly, SELinux has some interesting ideas, but interfaces are appalling.
Either they've never cared about it, or they have no taste (or have, er,
overriding manag^Wissues actively hostile to any taste).  Take your pick.
And don't get me started on access to file by inumber and other beauties
in that excuse of an API.  It wasn't designed.  It happened.  As in, "it
happens".
