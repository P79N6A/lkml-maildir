That's what I don't see.  That the worst case is the _common_ simple
case.  Sure it's the simpler case, but I see random paging as a common
case which is the best case for this heuristic.
You _might_ be right, but do you know for sure?  I.e. has it ever been
measured?
Two more things:
  - Using numbers plucked from the air, the heuristic's worst case will
    reduce throughput by at most 2%, and the best case can improve
    throughput by several times.  So the "typical average behaviour" may
    improve even if the heuristic doesn't reorder requests most of the
    time.
  - You can make it self-tuning w.r.t. whether it is worth doing
    according to recent access patterns.  To do this, if a request
    arrives within 100us if a long seek request being issued, and the
    request which arrived would have been a short seek, then the
    heuristic would have been a gain.  It may be that monitoring the
    occurrence of that indicates the future likelihood of the heuristic
    being a gain.  (Again, need's measurement).
    In this way even the worst case you are thinking of is avoided.
