Well, this should be more like bootsplash support; simple, preload
bitmaps before you start suspend sequence, no 3d-accelerated
hell. I'll actually make sure I have reasonably-looking progress bar
ready, so people don't have reason to invent some nightmare.

If they try to switch back to X, it will just deadlock on them. If
they try to communicate using IPC, boom, deadlock. They still may do
something stupid; I'll do my best to educate them not to do
that. Writing to filesystem would be especially bad, for example. But
that should be reasonably easy to understand...
