I know this isn't a kernel issue, strictly speaking, but this seems
to be the best place to get the "right" answers.  
I'm considering doing some work to add some minor features to 
existing Linux commands - a Unicode command line option for
"strings", for instance - partially for utility of the new features, and 
partially for the experience of doing it.
Assuming I come up with something that's useful and reliable, do 
I send the patch file here, even though external cmds are not part
of the kernel itself, or where?  
If I'd like to get minor additions like this into distributions, is the
best route to create a new command ("stringUni"), cloning the 
base code, or add an option to the existing cmd?  (I know that
cloning the code is a maintenance issue; I'm asking solely about
the procedural issue of getting the enhancement accepted on
an "official" basis.)
TIA,
Lou
