Except...
a) It doesn't work (yeah, I'm sure there are many, many, many other
work-arounds, but I can't believe I'm the only one compiling as root):
$ cd /usr/src/linux
$ make dep clean bzImage modules && su -c "make modules_install"
make[1]: Entering directory `/usr/src/linux/arch/i386/boot'
make[1]: Nothing to be done for `dep'.
make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/linux/arch/i386/boot'
scripts/mkdep init/*.c > .depend
/bin/sh: .depend: Permission denied
make: *** [dep-files] Error 1
b) You are still evaluting most, if not all, of the lines in the Makefiles
that do "gcc -o /dev/null", as root.

Which is exactly why I suggested keeping it open via I/O redirection
(except see below).

You are right here though...the I/O redirection doesn't have anything to
do with it, assuming you pass the -S flag to gcc, which I neglected, and
insert the missing '>' in my example above (oops).
But... this seems to be moot since in my case however /dev/null stays
around even when compiling as root. ;)
