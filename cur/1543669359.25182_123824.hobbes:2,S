Er, compatmac is there to make new code work in older kernels. The only
concession we have to make for compatibility in the actual code is that
#include, and we put all the ugliness into compatmac.h which makes it
work in older kernels. 
So compatmac.h ends up _empty_ in the latest kernel, but that doesn't
mean it's not needed.
Please don't break stuff just for the sake of it.
