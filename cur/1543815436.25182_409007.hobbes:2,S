Subject: [PATCH 28/46] kbuild: small update of allnoconfig description
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/3/21/214

'allnoconfig' is described by 'make help' as a "minimal config", that's not
strictly correct. To be pedantic, a minimal config would be one where
EMBEDDED was set to Y and most things therein disabled etc. Simply
answering 'no' to all options does not give a minimal config.
A better description of allnoconfig is that it answers all options with 'no'.
This patch updates the description.
