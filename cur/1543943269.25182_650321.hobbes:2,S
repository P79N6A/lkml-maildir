Subject: [PATCH] [1/5] CPA: Split static_protections into required_static_prot and advised_static_prot
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/2/8/137

There is a big difference between NX and RO. NX absolutely has to be cleared
or the kernel will fail while RO just can be set, but does not need to.
And for a large page area not setting NX if there is a area below 
it that needs it is essential, while making it ro is optional again.
This is needed for a followup patch who uses requred_static_prot() for large 
pages where it is inconvenient to check all pages. 
No behaviour change in this patch.
