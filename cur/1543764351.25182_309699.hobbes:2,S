Ingo: the information is bogus, but you're wrong: the code doesn't "rely"  
on it.
The fact is, bogus information is _fine_. That's what speculative work is 
all about: working with bogus information, with the assumption that some 
later test will ignore it if it's not relevant.
And the later test _will_ ignore it if it isn't relevant. Look for 
yourself:
        cmpl $((4 << 8) | 3), %eax
        je ldt_ss                       # returning to user-space with LDT SS
notice how the "cmpl" _only_ triggers if the old CS had the low three bits 
set and if EFLAGS_VM is clear. So if we return to kernel mode (or vm86) 
mode, we _know_ that the SS is bogus, but we don't care. We've tested for 
the proper thing, and we only do the special user-space LDT SS case if
 - the LDT bit was set in SS (possibly bogus)
AND
 - old CS was user space
AND
 - old eflags wasn't vm86 mode.
Ie the two second checks are what validates the first (possibly bogus) 
one.
So I really think that the _correct_ fix is literally to move the "cli" 
in the sysenter path down two lines. It doesn't just "hide" the bug, it 
literally fixes is.
