In theory LVM is meant to handle the raid bits as well, once the mirror 
target is improved to properly handle error correction, and the raid5 
target stabilizes.  Thus md won't be needed, you will just need an 
interface between the filesystem and lvm.

This is the kind of thing that should go in userspace.  The filesystem 
should just fire off events that tell a userspace daemon things like 
"the raid5 volume is now at x% use" and let it choose the policy, 
possibly by asking lvm to resize the underlying volume, then sending a 
message back to the fs that the volume has been resized, and it can 
start using the extra space.
