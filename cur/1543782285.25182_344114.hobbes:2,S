Sorry, the whole behaviour is complety fine.  I just don't thing the name
and calling convention of file_to_extint_device is optimal.  It should
take an struct inode * and be called just to_extint_device or someting.
The above would become
	struct extint_device *ed = to_extint_device(filp->f_dentry->d_inode);
