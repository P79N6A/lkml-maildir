There is a nicer way of achieving the same thing:
CFLAGS	+= -nostdinc -iwithprefix include
`-iwithprefix DIR'
     Add a directory to the second include path.  The directory's name
     is made by concatenating PREFIX and DIR, where PREFIX was
     specified previously with `-iprefix'.  If you have not specified a
     prefix yet, the directory containing the installed passes of the
     compiler is used as the default.
