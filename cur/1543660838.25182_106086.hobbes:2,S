The library can write to ntfs quite safely indeed as can the new kernel
driver (present in 2.5.x and available as patch for 2.4.x from
http://linux-ntfs.sf.net/download.html.
  But the only thing that is
implemented in both is file overwrite, no change of file size is possible
at present. Also it is not possible to create/delete files/hard links/sym
links. Please note this is not due to a lack of knowledge, its just a
matter of having the time to implement it all... I am currently working on
adding truncate support to the library (the code will be later ported to
the kernel of course) and I have my new ntfstruncate utility working for
certain types of inodes and certain cases of truncation. But it is going
to take a while to have it completed. A lot of support code needs to be
written to cope with all cases... E.g. need to be able to allocate/free
clusters and inodes for a start (clusters are pretty much done, inode
freeing is done, too), resize attribute records, work with attribute list
attributes, ... Ntfs is complicated unfortunately...
Best regards,
