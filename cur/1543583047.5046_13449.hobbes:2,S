Ok, found it.  It is related to the last null byte problem in that it also
only happens when the direct item is split between two blocks.  This is
more likely as the tail increases in size, which is why you saw it on
larger small files.
The bug is in the code that zeros the unused part of the unformatted node
after a direct->indirect conversion.  This code only gets called when the
page/buffer wasn't already up to date, which is why you see it more when
there is less ram.
Fix will be out shortly....
