Hello all,
The Celistica server with the AMD chip-set has very poor
PCI performance with Linux (and probably W$ too).
The problem was traced to incorrect bridge configuration
in the HyperTransport(tm) chips that connect up pairs
of slots.
I don't know how to make a generic chip-set bug-fix, and
probably a new BIOS will come out with the correct values
in the registers. But right now, the following initialization
code will fix the box.
//-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
//
//  Some kind of problem, here. If the HyperTransport(tm) bridge
//  is found, one of the register values needs to be changed to
//  fix the bus performance. Need to turn back on prefetch.
//
    while((pdev = pci_find_device(0x1022, 0x7450, pdev)) != NULL)
        pci_write_config_dword(pdev,  0x4c, 0x2ec1);
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
