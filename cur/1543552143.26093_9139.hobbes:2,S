Why?  I don't see anything special that video_mmap() does, and IMHO the
driver needs to have control over that sort of thing.  video4linux mmap
area could be vmalloc'd memory, kmalloc'd memory, get_free_pages memory,
reserve_bootmem memory, or PCI shared memory...  Hell in theory it could
be a dummy framegrabber driver with mmap'able memory that can be swapped
out.

If I understand your patch, I should call vma_reserve(), and then
completely remove my no-op swapout().  Correct?
