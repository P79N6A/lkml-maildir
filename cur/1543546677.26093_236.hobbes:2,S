But this is a 'Unix' system, not VMS!  A task that gets interrupted
will get the CPU back as soon as the ISR is complete. Since you can't
schedule in an interrupt, this rule is absolute. That is true even
if a "bottom-half" is queued within the ISR. The bottom-half runs
after somebody has either given up the CPU, or has it stolen from
them via a context-switch.
Are you saying that a task will "switch CPUs" as a result of an
interrupt? I don't think that this is allowed to happen because
some task that's interrupted isn't going to get interrupted while
it's interrupted! Some other task might, but not this one.
Cheers,
