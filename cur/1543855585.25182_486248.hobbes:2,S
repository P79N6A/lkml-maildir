It's just that keep is the only option that can only be at the end, all
others can be followed by more, so it
made minor sense to use strcmp() to match the \0 too. But using strncmp
everywhere is fine too since the syntax checking on these things is always
quite weak and it probably doesn't make much difference either way. 
I would have gone with Ingo's fix, but if you prefer strncmp..?
