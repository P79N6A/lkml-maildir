Ok. As UTC <-> Unix time isn't _that_ difficult (kHTTPd needs to do just
that), I think the argument "Doing time-calculations in the kernel is
impossible" doesn't hold. This is with the possible exception of DST, but I 
think hwclock can be persuaded to inform the kernel about that as well.
[This doesn't mean I think the kernel should set the RTC, hwclock suits my
needs perfectly]
