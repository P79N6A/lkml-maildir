Ah, now I see. The problem is that in pre-2.6.20-rc1 the pb_fnmode was 
setting global variable, but after the HID layer rework, this is a per-hid 
variable, which is of course not updated when write to sysfs triggers.
I will try to fix this before I send 2.6.20-rc6 updates to Linus, thanks 
for pointing this out.
