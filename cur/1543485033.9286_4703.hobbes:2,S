I reported earlier that this fixes my ide-scsi problem with translation.
I was wrong :-( I found out that the same problem still appears (after
using cdrecodr without ejecting the disk the system is confused - for
example it finds bogus information about the cdrom like 1x/164x ...).
2.2.1-ac5 with your patch, HP 8100 cd-rw.

Tried this too, returning 1 unconditionally fixes my problem so this is
probably the translation.
