Indeed; having explicit write barriers would be a very useful feature,
but the drives MUST default to strict ordering unless reordering (with
write barriers) have been enabled explicitly by the OS.
Furthermore, I would like to add the following constraint to your
writeup:
** For each individual sector, a write MUST either complete or not
   take place at all.  In other words, writes are guaranteed to be
   atomic on a sector-by-sector basis.

P.S. Thanks, Andre, for taking the initiative of getting an actual
commit model into the standardized specification.  Otherwise we'd be
doomed to continue down the path where what operating systems need for
sane operation and what disk drives provide are increasingly
divergent.
