I am using 2.2.0-pre6 on i686.  I tried knfsd-981204.  I did not apply 
any kernel patches (a quick look showed the patches were already
applied, I think).
Here's what happens:
[root@nbeckerpc init.d]# ./nfs start
Starting NFS services: rpc.kstatd pacpc1.hns.com:/: Function not implemented
pacpc1.hns.com:/: Function not implemented
rpc.kmountd rpc.knfsd nfssvc: Function not implemented
[root@nbeckerpc init.d]# ./nfs start
Starting NFS services: pacpc1.hns.com:/: Function not implemented
pacpc1.hns.com:/: Function not implemented
rpc.knfsd nfssvc: Function not implemented

Jan 19 09:17:02 nbeckerpc mountd[7473]: getfh failed: Function not implemented 
Other machines can't mount.  Even a loopback mount fails (this is the
entry you see in the above log).  Please advise.
