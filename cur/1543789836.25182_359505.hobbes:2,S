Call your SuSE representative I'd say would be a pretty good first step.
SuSE/Novell have plenty of support options listed on their website,
shouldn't be hard to find the right contact info.

Don't put too much trust in the machine after the kernel has Oopsed.
It may appear to run, but most likely something is badly wrong in
kernel land at this point, so anything could happen - I'd say reboot
that machine as soon as you are able to.

2.6.5 is a pretty darn old kernel by now. First thing I would
personally do would be to go to kernel.org, grab a 2.6.13.4 kernel
source, build that, then try to reproduce the problem. An enourmous
amount of fixes have happened since 2.6.5.
