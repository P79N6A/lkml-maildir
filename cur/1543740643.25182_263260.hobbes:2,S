Subject: [PATCH] Quota warnings somewhat broken
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

  Hello,
> When a user exceeds his soft (and hard) disk quota, a warning message is
> printed to current->tty. However, output is a bit offset:
> 
> $ dd if=/dev/zero of=blk bs=1024 count=100000
> hda1: write failed, user block limit reached.
>                                              dd: opening `blk': Disk quota exceeded
> 
> This is due to the messages in fs/dquot.c only ending in "\n" but should
> probably end in "\r\n".
  Thanks for notifying. It looks like a good idea. Attached patch should apply
well to 2.6.9. Linus, please apply.
