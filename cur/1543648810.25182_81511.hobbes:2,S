Unfortunately removing that change off kernel/module.c did not help.
I may be wrong but considering in my case the kernel is crashing whether 
agpgart/radeon are compiled as modules or built-in, I suspect that this issue 
is larger than just modules sub-system.
Anyway I will start applying the patches from 00* on-wards from your tree to 
see if I can reliably prove where the problem is.
Thanks.
