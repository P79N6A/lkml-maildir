Sure it is.
The applications it loads and runs may not be GPL,
same as for Linux in general, but ndiswrapper is just fine.
There's no GPL non-conformance unless somebody is distributing
code that extends GPL functionality without GPLing that code.
And NDIS does not violate that.  Sure, it runs binary-only
drivers developed for another O/S, but it is NOT distributing those.
Cheers
