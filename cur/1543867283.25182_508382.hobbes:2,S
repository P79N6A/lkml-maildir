I'd suggest trying the noop scheduler with your ram based devices.  I 
don't see why these devices would need clever scheduling.  ...but prove 
me wrong if you will.  I haven't tested this.
echo noop > /sys/block/<device>/queue/scheduler
If you don't need journaling EXT2 might be a good choice.  But, I'd also 
like to re-iterate the XFS filesystem recommendation given several times 
now as well.  There are many tunables that /may/ help during filesystem 
creation.  Block size (-b) set to it's maximum would prob. help.
If you're sure you can not encounter power issues:
mount -t xfs -o nobarrier /dev/<device> /mount-point
Here's some more general reading for ya:
