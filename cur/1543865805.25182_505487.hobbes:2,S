Dear Francois:
Thanks for your reply. I gave my idea about your questions with the the
key word "ANS_2".
If you have further questions, please raise them.
Best Regards,

ANS_2:
So, do you think that it is a good idea to keep other vendos's PID and
DID in the part?

ANS_2:
Sure! You are right. RTL8110SC, RTL8111B and RTL8101E have modest
differences, now. However, RTL8101E is a PCI-E fast ethernet controller.
I don't think is a good idea to merge its Linux driver into r8168.c or
r8169.c. RTL8110SC is the final version of Realtek PCI gigabit ethernet
controller. Moreover, due to the increasing popularity of PCI-E, Realtek
is going to design several generations of PCI-E ethernet controllers to
satisfy customer requests. I have discussed this issue with my hardware
colleagues. They believe that both MAC register layout and tx/rx
descriptor layout will be changed a lot in new PCI-E ICs. Actually, they
already did. Therefore, the hardwares of RTL8111B(PCI-E gigabit
ethernet) and RTL8101E(PCI-E fast ethernet) will have frequent and
drastic changes. So, I think that it's a good moment to separate their
Linux drivers, and r8169.c can become stable.

ANS_2:
I have the specs of RTL8110S/SB/SC. According those specs, the two bits are reserved. Since I didn't create this driver, I don't know who wrote it. I think they are not used.

ANS_2:
Thanks for your suggestion. I will see those drivers that you suggest. And revise my driver.
