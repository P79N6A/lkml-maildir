As one of the other people involved, I think the solution which was agreed
on was to have the lower level functions provided with (struct pci_bus *,
u8 dev, u8 fn) since that is what's really needed to implement the config
accesses. The standard PCI config functions, taking struct pci_dev * are
merely a wrapper around these. Greg did a patch to implement it, and it
looks like it got merged.
pci_bus_{read,write}_config_{byte,word,dword}()
