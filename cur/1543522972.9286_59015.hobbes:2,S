Well, I hate to say this, but SNAFU is what Linux 2.3 seems to
becomming.  Yes, I know development kernel.  But this one sure went down
hill.
The last one I used successfully was 2.3.36/38.  This 2.3.40pre5 to
release all had this problem...
I don't know how to diagnose it, but here goes.  Yes, I irc.  I use it
to communicate with friends around the world.  The normal channels work
fine.  Recieving files and dcc chats do NOT work.  They become severely
lagged.  This seems to also happen with X clients, so it may also affect
ipc.
This seems to only happen with one person... at least as bad as it has
been.  It does slow over time with othes.  All others, including worst
case, are win98 and 98se.  It seems falling back to 2.3.33 fixes the
problem completely.
If a tcpdump is needed, please tell me what paramaters to run it with.
Trever
