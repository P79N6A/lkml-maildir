(anyone having the leak troubles)
Have you seen the problem with free showing 4G of buffers or such?  If
you see that, (and if it _does_ have the same consequences as in 2.3.x)
death isn't far away.  I made a booboo in 2.3.x in using try_to_free_buffers
which caused the exact symptoms reported for 2.2.11.  MM gets very upset
(murderously so) when buffermem doesn't get updated properly ;)
The symptoms were remarkably similar, so I thought I'd mention it as
something to watch for.
