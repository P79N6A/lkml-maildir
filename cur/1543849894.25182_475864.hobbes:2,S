Attached is the source for a small library (libkvm.a) and a small test 
harness (kvmctl) plus a few tests (test/*).  The only test which will 
work now is sieve.flat (I haven't used the tests since we got a real OS 
booting, and had to scrub it up a bit).  The tests are currently only 
for x86_64.
The library is also used in our qemu patch (not included). I'll post 
that later on.
Basically, the library adds function wrappers around the ioctl()s, and 
converts exit reasons to callbacks, so the user need not code that large 
switch.
To try it, compile it, modprobe kvm, and
    ./kvmctl test/bootstrap test/sieve.flat
"bootstrap" is a bit of code to take the machine to 32-bit nonpaged 
mode.  sieve.flat will go into long mode and tell you some uninteresting 
facts about prime numbers.
