Well it's closer but not really what i want.
The min/max_type is maybe the way to go, but the above can still bit you if
the types differ. Consider max().
char lut[256];
int   c1 = 256+rand()%256;
char  c2 = rand()%256;
char dest = lut[max(c2,c1)];
Won't c1 still be returned untruncated?
Ofcourse one will use another construct for these kinds of checks, but maybe
your brain collapses just for a second and think that this will return a
char.
OK ok bad example, but maybe you see that i have a point here somewhere
(under my chair? :) ).
