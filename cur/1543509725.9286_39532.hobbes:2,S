The kernel code is written in C. C requires that NULL be defined as
(void *)0. Returning a NULL as a literal 0 is incorrect in C. There
should not be any kernel headers included in an C++ code. Headers that
could be included are protected with conditional statements like:
#ifndef NULL
#ifdef __cplusplus
#define NULL 0
#else
#define NULL (void*)0
#endif
#endif
This was from <stdio.h>......
If this was flame-bait, forget it.
