Subject: [patch 064/101] Fix interrupt probing on E450 sparc64 systems

[SPARC64]: Fix PCI interrupts on E450 et al.
When the PCI controller OBP node lacks an interrupt-map
and interrupt-map-mask property, we need to form the
INO by hand.  The PCI swizzle logic was not doing that
properly.
This was a regression added by the of_device code.
