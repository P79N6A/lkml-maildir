Browse /proc/sys/net/ipv4 at some point. Most operating systems don't have
that amount of customizable tcp options. If you really must chop out the
fixes for other software, go #ifdef crazy on your personal kernel tree.
I think stuff like that is not configurable because you don't want #ifdef's
polluting the fastpath and/or variables doing the same.
It's easier to fix bugs without those type of variables involved. :)
