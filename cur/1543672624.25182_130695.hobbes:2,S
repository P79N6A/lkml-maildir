Allocating stuff on the stack _is_ bad if you allocate more than a few
hundred bytes. That's _especially_ true deep down in the call-sequence,
ie in device drivers, low-level filesystems etc.
The kernel stack is a very limited resource, with no protection from
overflow. Being lazy and using automatic variables is a BAD BAD thing,
even if it's syntactically easy and generates good code.
