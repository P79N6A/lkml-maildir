That's why there are a number of efforts to make modular SELinux  
policies.  A good SELinux policy provides a few core system types and  
labels which a policy developer needs to understand, as well as some  
good macros to simplify the human-editable policy files.  For  
instance, in my customized policy a daemon run by an initscript which  
reads a single config file in /etc needs this policy (Note that I use  
"_d" as a suffix for process domains instead of the usual "_t"):
initrc_daemon(foo_exec_t, foo_d)
daemon_config(foo_d, foo_conf_t)
Add maybe 2 lines for network port access, another 2 for database  
files in /var, plus maybe an "iptables" rule or two in your firewall  
file.

Average users are not supposed to be writing security policy.  To be  
honest, even average-level system administrators should not be  
writing security policy.  It's OK for such sysadmins to tweak  
existing policy to give access to additional web-docs or such, but  
only expert sysadmin/developers or security professionals should be  
writing security policy.  It's just too damn easy to get completely  
wrong.

You don't have to understand the entire default policy; that's the  
point of modular policy.  You only have to understand how to _use_  
the interfaces of the system policy (which are documented) and how  
the particular daemon policy is supposed to work.  The people  
developing the core system policy need to understand the inner  
workings of said policy, but they don't need to understand how the  
rest of the system works.  The core functionality behind this  
separation is macro interfaces and attributes.  By grouping types  
with attributes it is possible for arbitrary daemon types to  
categorize themselves under access rules defined by the base policy,  
and with interfaces the daemons don't really even need to know what  
those attributes are called.

This is the whole advantage of SELinux type attributes: you can  
define a type "var_foo_t" which has a specific list of attributes;  
rules which accept type specifiers can also accept attribute  
specifiers as well.  If what you want is a label which may be  
accessed in two different ways, then you declare attributes for each  
access method and declare a type which has the attributes "filetype",  
"access1", and "access2" (assuming access1 and access2 are the names  
of the attributes you declared and used in your access rules).

As I said before, average Linux users should not be writing their own  
security policy.  I have yet to meet an "average Linux user" who  
could reliably quote for me what the file permissions on the "/tmp"  
directory should be, or what the sticky bit was.  A small percentage  
of average Linux system administrators don't get that right  
consistently, and if you don't understand the sticky bit then you  
should *definitely* not be controlling program permissions on a per- 
syscall basis.
