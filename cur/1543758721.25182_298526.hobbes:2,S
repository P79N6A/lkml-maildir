I just got bit by a similar issue myself last night.  Had a working 2.6.11-rc5-mm1 tree
compiled with gcc 3.4.  Then Fedora-devel had an update to gcc 4.0, so I
rebuilt the *same exact tree* with it, and it threw 3 errors at me, for
exit_orinoco() in drivers/net/wireless/orinoco.c and init_hermes() and exit_hermes()
in drivers/net/wireless/hermes.c.  Here's what the code looked like:
(hermes.c)
static int __init init_hermes(void)
{
        return 0;
}
static void __exit exit_hermes(void)
{
}
module_init(init_hermes);
module_exit(exit_hermes);
That's it.  As far as I can tell, gcc 4.0 semi-correctly determined they were both
static functions with no side effect, threw them away, and then the module_init
and module_exit threw undefined symbols for them.
My totally incorrect workaround was to stick a printk(KERN_DEBUG) in the body
of the 3 trimmed functions so they had side effects.
Anybody got a *better* solution?
