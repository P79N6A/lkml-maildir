Nope, that's against how BK works. It's really distributed, so "my" tree 
has no special meaning, and as such the fact that I pull has no meaning 
either - it doesn't trigger as anything special.
The only thing that ends up being special is when it hits the public tree
which has the trigger to send out the emails. IOW, the date of the _email_
is special (in that it says when a commit hit the public tree), not not
the commits changesets themselves.
Now, if James trigger scripts set the date of the email by the date of the 
commit, that sounds like a misfeature, but you'd better talk to James, not 
me, since he's the one doing that part..
