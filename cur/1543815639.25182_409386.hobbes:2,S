I tried the following kernels (all with only THM0):
1. No other changes: It hangs, as before and as expected.
2. Commented out a large chunk of the UPDT() method:

                                     Release (I2CM)
                                 }
                             }
So now it just grabs and releases the I2CM lock.  
This kernel hung on the first sleep, but I couldn't reproduce that
behavior.  I tried two more boots, and each time it never hung.  I even
thought it might depend on the result of previous boots, so I tried
kernel #1 again and got the same hang, and then tried #2.  But it still
wouldn't hang.  So I went back through the serial console logs to check
whether I was hallucinating, and I was not.  This kernel had indeed hung
on the first sleep, but only the first time I booted it.
So I'm going to assume that it's okay, and that if it isn't okay, it's
because of another, more intermitten bug.
3. Commented out EC0.UPDT() call in THM0._THM, and this kernel was fine,
   which is how it behaved a couple days ago, and is what I expected.
I'm about to try a smaller change (continuing the bisect):

                                 }
After that bisection there's not much more to change in UPDT().
However, I can drill down into I2RB() because of this line in UPDT():
    Store (I2RB (Zero, 0x01, 0x04), Local7)
But I have no idea what's safe to experiment with in I2RB():
                    Method (I2RB, 3, NotSerialized)
                    {
                        Store (Arg0, HCSL)
                        Store (ShiftLeft (Arg1, 0x01), HMAD)
                        Store (Arg2, HMCM)
                        Store (0x0B, HMPR)
                        Return (CHKS ())
                    }
All those lines look like tricky hardware manipulations.
By the way, which debug_{level,layer} settings will show the lines of
the human-readable DSDT as they are executed?
