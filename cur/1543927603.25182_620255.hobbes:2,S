Do you know any good way for performing a softreset within the driver?
The video application should get a continuous datastream after
resuming the notebook, so the driver shouldn't be unloaded.
The driver also keeps a list of previous camera settings which should
be set up again after resuming. Stopping the video application and
reattaching the device using ACPI (this board supports reconnecting
the device using ACPI) should be avoided.
