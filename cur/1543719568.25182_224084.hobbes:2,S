This patch fixes the case where certain laptop touchpads (ALPS) 
are disabled if the machine boots with a usb mouse plugged in.
Without it, users have to choose between using either a usb mouse 
or the touchpad. With it, any combination is possible and the usb 
mouse can be attached/removed at runtime without breaking the 
touchpad.
The patch is ported from a SuSE kernel to 2.6.7-rc2. It's been
around for at least two minor releases. The maintainer was
contacted regarding merging but failed to respond.
Patch vital to certain laptop users. Please apply.
