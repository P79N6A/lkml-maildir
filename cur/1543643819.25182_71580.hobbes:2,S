This looks pretty good.  Andrew Morton has had a look over it too and 
agrees that it should go in after a bit of testing.  Does someone want 
to try comparing throughput of dio based aio vs normal read/write?  It 
would be interesting to see what kind of an effect pipelining aios makes 
and if there are any performance niggles we need to squash.  Cheer,
