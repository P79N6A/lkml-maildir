Even if you put /usr on a separate partition, users can create a setuid (not 
setuid-root) program in their home directory. Other users can create links to 
this program in their home directory. Even if this can't be used to become 
root, it shouldn't be possible. To prevent this, you have to put every user's 
home directory on a separate partition.
