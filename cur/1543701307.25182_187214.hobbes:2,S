Hi,
I just upgraded from kernel 2.6.0-test10 to 2.6.0 without changing anything 
to my  existing configuration (make oldconfig, etc.).  After rebooting, the 
console was completely unreadable, with garbage all over the screen.  It was 
working correctly in 1024x768 before and X still worked correctly.
Here some infos:
I have a Mobility Radeon M7 on a Clevo 5600 laptop running Slackware 9.1.
Here is the output of lspci for my AGP card:
01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: ATI Technologies Inc Radeon Mobility M7

Here is a diff of drivers/video/radeonfb.c between 2.6.0-test10 and 2.6.0
# diff linux-2.6.0-test10/drivers/video/radeonfb.c 
linux-2.6.0/drivers/video/radeonfb.c
2093,2094c2093
<         /* info->fix.line_length = rinfo->pitch*64; */
<       info->fix.line_length = mode->xres_virtual*(mode->bits_per_pixel/8);
---
>         info->fix.line_length = rinfo->pitch*64;
-----------------------
I replaced the new radeonfb.c with the old from 2.6.0-test10 and my problem 
was solved.
Is this new 'feature' of radeonfb was supposed to solve anything?  It sure 
have ain't for me.
Am I the only one who had experienced this kind of behavior?
Thanks
