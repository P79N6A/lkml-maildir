	The code that I think I more or less have in my head has not
changed (aside from that fourth test).
	Although I was not aware of q->last_merge, I see that it is
not what I want.  I want up to one hint per request, for the last bio
in the request.  bi_hint would be null for all bio's except possibly
the last bio in a request.  I do not want just one hint per queue.
	If it is unclear what I mean, perhaps I really need to code it
up to explain it. and we can discuss it from there.
