I know that fact clearly, but I am down to WAGS.
This is almost as bad as the ATA-33 -- 430HX PIIX3 detection crashes.
All bets are off that this will be resolved quickly.
I am curious if it (the drive in question) works period; regardless of the
OS, chipset, etc..........
I have read somewhere (provided the dyslexia doesn't get the better) that
we can do it with DMA, but never attempted or needed.
#define WIN_IDENTIFY            0xEC    /* ask drive to identify itself */
#define WIN_IDENTIFY_DMA        0xEE    /* same as WIN_IDENTIFY, but DMA */
What is your best WAG, Mark?  I am out of them for the time being.
Do you still have your tuning notes on the PIIX3/4 chipsets?  I am have a
rough time in the design based on the check backs against "sitre" flags.
