Not a good idea... the whole point is to make sure no one is in a syscall when
the module is unloaded. If you do it this way, the tail end of this syscall
can fight with the module unload code.

I'm already doing that... See the release() call on the fd. But this doesn't
stop someone from invoking a syscall at an inappropriate time.
