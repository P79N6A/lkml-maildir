No.  Megaraid is a PCI card.  Therefore this one codebase should support
*all* PCI-capable architectures, not just these three.  Nobody's requiring
that you test on all the weird and wonderful architectures out there, just
that you don't do things like
#if defined(__x86_64__) || defined(__ia64__)
#endif
when you really mean
#ifdef CONFIG_COMPAT
#endif

the nation that is attacked, and every man will be glad of those
conscience-soothing falsities, and will diligently study them, and refuse
to examine any refutations of them; and thus he will by and by convince 
himself that the war is just, and will thank God for the better sleep 
he enjoys after this process of grotesque self-deception." -- Mark Twain
