Though I'm not sure I even have an i8042 (I'm guessing no, as I run
on a Mac) the detection failure path has gone a little wonky in recent
kernels.  Half the time it times out with the following (as it ought, 
me thinks)
IN from bad port 64 at c01f3100
IN from bad port 64 at c01f3100
IN from bad port 64 at c01f3100
IN from bad port 64 at c01f3100
i8042.c: i8042 controller self test timeout.
But the other half of the time it stalls my machine out entirely.
Clues?  Want my .config?
I'm running on a Titanium PowerBook3,5.
