At least the 4.2 (file dated 7/29/83) or the 4.3reno (file dated
6/28/90) doesn't contain such comment. There's no copyright statement in
4.2, but there is in 4.3reno.
4.2 (& 4.3):
--- 8< ---
/*
 * Error codes
 */
--- 8< ---
#define ENOTTY          25              /* Not a typewriter */
--- 8< ---
4.3reno:
--- 8< ---
#define ENOTTY          25              /* Inappropriate ioctl for
device */
--- 8< ---
