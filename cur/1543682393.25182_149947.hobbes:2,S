No, CONFIG_MII only occasionally affects mii-tool support.  Further, 
CONFIG_MII is forced on if it is needed.
As I explained in another mail, older mii-tool binaries use the 
traditional -- but non-standard -- ioctls for the MII operations.  Newer 
versions of mii-tool use the proper SIOC[GS]MIIxxx ioctls.
The proper fix is to obtain the latest version of mii-tool, possibly 
from net-utils cvs if nowhere else.
