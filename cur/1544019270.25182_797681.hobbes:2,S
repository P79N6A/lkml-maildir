But what about people who want to know what the current usages are, so
that they _can_ monitor things and adjust them on the fly if things are
about to go boom?
I see no reason why we can't leave the value where it is today, and add
the ability to both turn the limits off entirely, and also report our
current usage.  That keeps the DOS from happening on "default" systems,
and lets admins have an idea if they need to bump up the values on their
systems as well.
I don't understand your objection to allowing the usage to be monitored.
