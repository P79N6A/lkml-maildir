Actually, this:
+	    (u64) (unsigned long)dma_map_single(dev, cmd->request_buffer,
+						cmd->request_bufflen,
+						DMA_BIDIRECTIONAL);
+	if (pci_dma_mapping_error(data->virtual_address)) {
+		printk(KERN_ERR
+		       "ibmvscsi: Unable to map request_buffer for command!\n");
+		return 0;
Should be
if(dma_mapping_error())
I have no idea why there are two identical APIs for the mapping error,
but since you use the DMA API, you should use its version.  You can also
drop the #include <linux/pci.h> as well.
This:
+	sg_mapped = dma_map_sg(dev, sg, cmd->use_sg, DMA_BIDIRECTIONAL);
+
+	if (pci_dma_mapping_error(sg_dma_address(&sg[0])))
+		return 0;
Is wrong.  dma_map_sg returns zero if there's a mapping error, you
should check for that.
