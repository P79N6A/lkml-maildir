The code only works on the stock scheduler.  It is the same interface
and has the same behavior as the O(1) scheduler version, but the code is
very very different.
If this patch is merged, you can safely use set_cpus_allowed() in either
kernel (which is the intention).  But you cannot use this routine's code
on either scheduler.
