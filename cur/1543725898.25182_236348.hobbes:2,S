Dammit, -bk7 to -bk8 is a 1.8M diff.  Relevant changes include the switch
to the rcu callbacks (make them take an rcu_head* rather than a void*) and
the introduction of /proc/sys/vm/vfs_cache_pressure.
So the immediate question is: please check the contents of your
vfs_cache_pressure tunable.  It should be 100.  A setting of zero would
cause this behaviour.

It would be useful to try a different compiler version.
There's _something_ different in your setup.  If we can work out what this
factor is, it will lead us to the bug.
