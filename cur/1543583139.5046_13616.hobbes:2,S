Reboot. Look at the boot messages. You should see your disk mentioned
and the partitions listed (hde: hde1).
If they disappear too quickly, say "dmesg | grep hde".
Test the size of hde1 with "blockdev --getsize /dev/hde1"
or "fdisk -s /dev/hde1" or so. If you get 0 that explains
the mke2fs error.
Make sure your tools are up to date. Old versions often have
an overflow somewhere.
