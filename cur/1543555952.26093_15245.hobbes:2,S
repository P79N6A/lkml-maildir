Agreed.  I suspect that this could be a rough spot with reiserfs-3.6.19.
I observed one similar freezup while doing
tar zxvf linux-2.4.0-test11.tar.gz 
while running 2.4.0-test11-pre7, patched with reiserfs-3.6.19.
I and others have experienced some off-normal behaviour with 
reiserfs, like crashing when saving a file on top of itself with StarOffice
5.2 when the file was on an NFS server.  That particular bug
was fixed in reiserfs-3.6.14, IIRC.  But even with the few rough edges, 
reiserfs has become essential to our operations, with its ability to recover
so quickly after a UPS has caused problems.  That's why I'm following the
2.4.0 development so closely with reiserfs.
I was never able to reproduce the tar freeze.  The freeze which I
observed with test11-ac2,4 SMP and KDE 2.0 was very reproducable; I saw
it at least 6 times, always in exactly the same place of the startup of
KDE 2.0.
Tomorrow when I have access to the two-way P-III problem machine,
I'll repatch 2.4.0-test11-ac4 with reiserfs-3.6.18,
which is a little less bleeding edge than reiserfs-3.6.19.
Meanwhile, 2.4.0-test12-pre2 patched with reiserfs-3.6.19 is running
nicely with KDE 2.0 on the uniprocessor home machine.
