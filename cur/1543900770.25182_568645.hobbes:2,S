Yes, it's boring for gmail users, I generally read messages from gmail
web pages, and send patches via mutt with ssmtp.
1. write ~/.mutt/ssmpt.conf as follows:
mailhub=smtp.gmail.com:587
UseSTARTTLS=YES
UseTLS=YES
AuthUser=yourid@gmail.com
AuthPass=***
FromLineOverride=YES
2. write ~/.mutt/ssmpt script:
#!/bin/sh
/usr/sbin/ssmtp -C ~/.mutt/ssmtp.conf $@
3.add the follow line to ~/.mutt/muttrc
set sendmail="~/.mutt/ssmtp"

dave
