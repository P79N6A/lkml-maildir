Please show me how you would do a binary search with arch.
I don't really like the arch model, it's far too restrictive and it's 
jumping through hoops to get to an acceptable speed.
What I expect from a SCM is that it maintains both a version index of the 
directory structure and a version index of the individual files. Arch 
makes it especially painful to extract this data quickly. For the common 
cases it throws disk space at the problem and does a lot of caching, but 
there are still enough problems (e.g. annotate), which require scanning of 
lots of tarballs.
bye, Roman
