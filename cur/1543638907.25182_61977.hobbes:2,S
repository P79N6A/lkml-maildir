Hello kernel experts,
Just i tryed to setup a VPN using freeswan-1.97 and vanilla kernel-2.4.18+ac3 
patch. Before compile my kernel, I read the documentation and i saw that is 
recommended to keep the following options in kernel config file: 
CONFIG_NETLINK and CONFIG_NETLINK_DEV
Beginning with kernel-2.4.17, the option Kernel/User netlink socket 
(CONFIG_NETLINK) is MISSING, and present is ONLY the second option:
Netlink device emulation (CONFIG_NETLINK_DEV)
Can anybody tell me with what option has been replaced this option?
Can ignore this missing feature?
Best Regards,
Iulian
