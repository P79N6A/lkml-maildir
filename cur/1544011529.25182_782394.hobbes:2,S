Ingo did not like the rebase and kept the original commits (the one with 
the change log with the incorrect spelling).

    powerpc: ftrace, convert to new dynamic ftrace arch API
    
    Impact: update to PowerPC ftrace arch API
    
    This patch converts PowerPC to use the new dynamic ftrace arch API.
    
    Thanks to Paul Mackennas for pointing out the mistakes of my original
    test_24bit_addr function.

The branch in my tree 'ppc/ftrace' has not been changed since. The only 
reason the commits in my tree are different than the ones in tip was 
because I rebased to fixed the spelling in the change log.
