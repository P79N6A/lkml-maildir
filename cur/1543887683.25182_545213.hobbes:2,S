That was the whole point.  JFFS2, the journaling flash filesystem, is a
strictly log-structured filesystem.  LogFS has a journal.
It is also the filesystem that tries to scale logarithmically, as Arnd
has noted.  Maybe I should call it Log2 to emphesize this point.  Log1
would be horrible scalability.

Maybe.  FFS or flash filesystem already exists.  And YAFFS, yet another
flash filesystem, would be older than flashfs.
My experience is that no matter which name I pick, people will complain
anyway.  Previous suggestions included:
jffs3
jefs
engelfs
poofs
crapfs
sweetfs
cutefs
dynamic journaling fs - djofs
tfsfkal - the file system formerly known as logfs
Plus today:
FFFS
flashfs
fredfs
bob
shizzle
Imo they all suck.  LogFS also sucks, but it allows me to make a stupid
joke and keep my logfs.org domain.
