Trivially, from what I can test.  I just chrooted myself into /tmp/test,
copied in mount, all the libraries associated with mount, and bash (so I
could run programs).  Then 'mount none -t proc /proc' gave me proc.
However, on the 2.2.x kernel that I'm using, the cwd and root directories
are actually symlinks, not like before, so I can't really do much in
there.
2.0.35
lrwx------   1 root     root           64 May 28 21:12 cwd -> [0801]:2
2.2.9
lrwx------   1 root     root            0 May 28 14:21 cwd -> /
In 2.0.35 I can trivially break out of a chroot jail via proc.  2.2.x, I
think it's impossible.
Just thought I'd point out that if you've got root access, and you did it
via a stack overflow or what have you, then you can easily modify the code
you push onto the stack to create a dummy /etc/fstab file.
