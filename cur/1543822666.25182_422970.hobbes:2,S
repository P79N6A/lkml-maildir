Subject: [PATCH] PIIX: fix 82371MX enablebits

Hello.
     According to the datasheet, Intel 82371MX (MPIIX) actually has only a
single IDE channel mapped to the primary or secondary ports depending on the
value of the bit 14 of the IDETIM register at PCI config. offset 0x6C (the
register at 0x6F which the driver refers to. doesn't exist). So, disguise the
controller as dual channel and set enablebits masks/values such that only
either primary or secondary channel is detected enabled. Also, preclude the
IDE probing code from reading PCI BARs, this controller just doesn't have them
(it's not the separate PCI function like the other PCI controllers), it only
decodes the legacy addresses.
MBR, Sergei
