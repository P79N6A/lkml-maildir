	Think of layered filesystems (unionfs, umsdos *shrieks* for that,
hfs would be much nicer, all sorts of encryption, devfs, etc.). Look at
the way symlinks work in UMSDOS. It's ugly. Size of inode includes the
size of *fattest* fs-specific part, so stacking them is not an option
now. Feather-weight inodes would be very useful.

	Not exactly. dcache is a primary cache. icache is the second-level
one. I.e. when you do lookup you may find out that inode you need is
already in icache. If you are in low-memory situation it makes sense to
trim icache to minimum (i.e. to the stuff referenced from dcache).
Generally you don't want to do it, at least for local filesystems having
real inodes (e.g. UNIX-like ones).
	BTW, is there a decent way to create a cache from module? slabs
want permanent storage, if I've parsed the comment in mm/slab.c right. I
really need it for clean rewrite of FAT-derived stuff (cache for directory
entries in FAT sense; that would solve all problems with bogus inumbers).
