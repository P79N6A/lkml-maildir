I wasn't claiming that it wasn't fixed UNTIL 2.4.20-24.7 specifically.
I was merely stating that 2.4.20-24.7 appears to contain the fix.
After some research it looks like the fix is sortof there in
RedHat's 2.4.20-13.7.  It behaves better, but not as good as 2.4.23
or 2.4.20-24.7.  By "better" I mean kswapd (and bdflush, kupdated,
kreclaimd) doesn't hog the CPU(s) as much; but it still does to
a greater extent compared to what I'm calling the "fixed" versions.
So in 2.4.20-13.7 it's quasi-busted or quasi-fixed, depending on
your half-full/empty position.

Exactly my point!
I suppose I am working from the assumption that if vanilla
(kernel.org) 2.4.20 was fixed then 2.4.21-4EL would also be fixed
(which it's not).  It would seem to me that a kernel's got no
business calling itself 2.4.21-<anything> if it's not based off of
previous kernel base.  Otherwise, "21" has absolutely no meaning.
Imperical evidence seems to indicate that vanilla 2.4.20 does not
contain the fix.  Whereas something that RedHat calls 2.4.20-XYZ does.
