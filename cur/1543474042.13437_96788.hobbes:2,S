I have to agree with the later camp there... The issue is one for the kernel,
and should link into device-driver management and first-order resource
management (I/O, IRQ, DMA, Memory); and maybe also second-order resource
management (SCSI devices, parallel port devices) in which the first order
driver exports an interface to another driver.
In my opinion, the kernel should be responsible for negotiating a device's set
of resources on behalf of the driver, and also negotiating how any of those
resources may be shared. This is independent, really, of whether the kernel
allows re-negotiation of the resources already bound to second device when the
first is 'discovered'. But if the kernel does allow this feature, it should
also be responsible for notifying already bound drivers of any changes in
their configurations, as well as adjusting the hardware.
Though some may consider PnP to be the absolute direst filth, it does matter
and it does need support from Linux - because a certain large Money Sink has
gone around waving the PnP banner sufficiently that the lay public thinks that
it is the best thing since sliced bread.
I also have to admit a small piece of self-interest in this camp - I have
written a kernel configuration manager utility that tries to fulfill the
integrated management role. It also tries to hide the differences between the
various hardware configuration protocols that are abound: PCI, PnP, PnP-BIOS,
and also legacy devices. This seems to work fairly well, and does not take up
a great deal of space.
I'm currently trying to work out how to add partial ACPI-BIOS support (which
my BIOS claims to have, and Win98 claims to find, but don't actually appear to
be anywhere in the BIOS).
