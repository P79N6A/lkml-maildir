The above also occurred with no SMP. 
I backed out Changeset 1.606 which did this in kernel/sched.c:
-	if (unlikely(in_interrupt()))
+	if (unlikely(in_atomic()))
and 2.5.34-mm2 was able to boot with CONFIG_PREEMPT=y.
Obviously, this is not a fix of any kind, but shows that the scheduler
may be being called with a preemption lock.
