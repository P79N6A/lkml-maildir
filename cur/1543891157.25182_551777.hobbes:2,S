... this is not.  You're correct.  So using KEY_UNKNOWN should not be the
preferred way, then.

Well, I also would appreciate bumping up KEY_MAX and a nice shiny set of
KEY_FN that covered all the missing ones for ThinkPads.  It is Dmitry you
have to convince about it.
That still doesn't make KEY_UNKNOWN without a scan code useful, so either
way, I think KEY_UNKNOWN should be limited to drivers that can remap
keycodes *and* which send MSC_SCAN events along with KEY_UNKNOWN, so that
you know what key to remap.  I don't care if it is easy or not to be nice to
the user and ask for a key remap, at least it will not be *impossible* like
it currently is.  Otherwise, we would be better off removing KEY_UNKNOWN
altogether (which I wouldn't mind much, either).
