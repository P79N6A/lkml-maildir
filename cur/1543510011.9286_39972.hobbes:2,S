yes, sorry I've just noticed it too. My assembler doesn't complain, but others
do. It seems they don't like the division in #defines. I don't understand why.
The only division is at line 55 in include/asm/kmsgdump.h. If you replace :
  ((NBHEADS*NBTRACKS*NBSECT)/SECTPERCLUST)
by
  (NBHEADS*NBTRACKS*NBSECT)
then it works fine. (in this case, SECTPERCLUST equals 1 so it doesn't matter).
I'll update the patch as soon as possible, but at the moment the server is
being upgraded and my account doesn't work anymore :-(
