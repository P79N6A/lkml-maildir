But the address of cmd_line_ptr is defined to be from the end of the
setup to 0xa0000. This is well defined, since the boot loader will
load the kernel, initramfs and cmd_line_ptr to the correct place...
Nothing is overwritten... Then the kernel is up and takes as much as
it needs from cmd_line_ptr.
