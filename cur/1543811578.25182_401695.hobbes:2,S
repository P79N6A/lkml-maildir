Document them where? In the kernel Documentation directory? I believe
those strings come back from the drive, as long as the human or
application can parse them the kernel operationally needs only what you
mentioned below.

The main problem with that file is that it wasn't mentioned several
years ago... and I hope you aren't even thinking of suggesting any
changes to something which has been around for years and which
applications are undoubtedly quietly using.
A changed version of the same information in /sys would be a better
solution if changes other than some additions are needed.

Presumably the max speed mechanically possible, in the units of "x"
which are used to identify both media and burners and have been since
"2x" was the fast burner.

CD-RW seems to cover that.

Why? The mmc/scsi commands work or don't, the device returns the info in
the capabilities page if the application can use it, so it doesn't seem
that the kernel cares, other than the cases you mentioned.

Isn't there a problem with having the same device in multiple places?
Someone posted that there was, but I didn't really get into the details.
In any case, why is opening dozens of files better than opening one file
with all of the info. Long names can be abbreviated, complexity in the
kernel to avoid complexity in the application is bad, particularly when
humans parse the existing format nicely.

The only applications which care about speeds other than max are already
reading the capabilities page. Use cdrecord with the "-prcap" options,
there is a boatload of stuff there. I agree the the three text items are
  useful, and major/minor to map the device to the name actually used in
/dev, but that data doesn't fit the format well, and might be better
presented in /sys. Preferably in a human readable format, like
/proc/scsi/scsi rather than multiple file per device.
