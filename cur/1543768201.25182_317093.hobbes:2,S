I am not sure I understand you. Why should we track ->prio=20 changes?
plist should be generic, I think.
Original code:
	unsigned plist_add (struct plist *pl, struct plist *plist)
	{
		__plist_add_sorted (plist, pl);
		if (pl->prio < plist->prio) {
			plist->prio = pl->prio;
			return !0;
		}
		return 0;
	}
This could be:
	int plist_add_and_check_min_prio_changed(node, head)
	{
		plist_add(node, head);
		return plist_next(head) == node;
	}
Or plist_add() could be easily changed to return -1,0,+1 to indicate
min/max prio changed/unchanged.
But may be it is better to return 'iter' from plist_add(). This way
we can avoid scanning ->prio_list when we add the node with the same
->prio next time. I am not sure.
And please note that pl_head "has" prio:
	plist_empty(head) ? INT_MAX			// -1 ?
			  : plist_next(head)->prio

Currently these functions are used in void context only. I think
it is better to add return codes when callers need them.
What do you think?
Oleg.
