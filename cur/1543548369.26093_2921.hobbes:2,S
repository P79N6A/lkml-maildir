   /proc/net/{tcp,udp,raw} show IPv4 addresses with host order, while
   port is shown with network order. The included patch adds the
   needed ntohl(). Not very usefull, but hopefully correct.
Are sure that netstat and other tools don't "fix" this?
I just checked, and they in fact do take care of byte swapping what
needs to be byte-swapped.
Thus, this patch would break more than it would fix.
