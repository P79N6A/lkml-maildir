I don't know... the command 'mknod' should probably remain for
compatibility reasons.  But the way that it does create the node can be
completely different.  For example the call could just be a wrapper to a
syscall or a write to a proc file.
I think Ingo had qualms with the process of creating of a device file
which is totally detached of the kernel's ability to service that device.
But I am with you.  The compatibility between *NIX should not be severed
so fast.
