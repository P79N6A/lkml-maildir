OK (still I think I'll be able to provide some more precise arguments for it,
but I'll need some more time).

Well, acutually we should understand why it helps I think, which makes it
interesting anyway, because in theory even without the patch we may be
vulnerable to a leftover "completion" that causes data to be written to a
storage.

Yes, Andrew please drop it.
[Nonetheless I'd appreciate it if someone could suggest a specific failing
scenario to me.]
