Maybe they'll just work, or maybe they'll appear to work,
but will silently corrupt user data...
This endeavor is full of risk, and I would be extremely careful
about enabling features that the BIOS explicitly disabled --
unless the hardware manufacturer publicly publishes
support for the feature, or the errata that you're working around.
Re: bad timing
If the BIOS advertises C2 latency > 100usec, then the BIOS
and the system do not support C2.
If the BIOS advertises C3 latency > 1000usec, then the BIOS
and the system do not support C3.
This isn't just a suggestion, it is the standard method
that the spec provides the BIOS to tell the OS to NOT USE these states.
Why would a BIOS do this when it appears that the registers
to enter C2 and C3 are present?  There are lots of possibilities,
but the most scary is that the feature may appear to work
but silently corrupts data.  This risk is particularly acute
for multi-core/SMP systems and C3.  For this state, the CPU
cache snooping is DISABLED.  So if the hardware has any issues
at all with DMA traffic or the memory traffic of another CPU
passing over the bus w/o first re-enabling snooping, then
the data is exposed to corruption.
I don't have religion against model-specific workarounds,
they have their place.  But they can be extremely risky, and this
risk is magnified when the vendor that produced the model is silent.
