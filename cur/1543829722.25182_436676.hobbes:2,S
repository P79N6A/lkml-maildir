Data point #1:
Here I quote from drivers/ide generic code ide_config_drive_speed() in 
ide-iops.c:
    /*
     * Allow status to settle, then read it again.
     * A few rare drives vastly violate the 400ns spec here,
     * so we'll wait up to 10usec for a "good" status
     * rather than expensively fail things immediately.
     * This fix courtesy of Matthew Faupel & Niccolo Rigacci.
     */
    for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            udelay(1);
            if (OK_STAT((stat = hwif->INB(IDE_STATUS_REG)),
			  DRIVE_READY, BUSY_STAT|DRQ_STAT|ERR_STAT)) {
                    error = 0;
                    break;
            }
    }
And there is similar logic in ide_wait_stat().  wait_drive_not_busy() in 
ide-taskfile.c waits for up to 1 ms.
Data point #2:
libata was originally based on the "highly correct" (or one version 
thereof) programming sequences found in Hale Landis's free ATADRVR 
(
http://www.ata-atapi.com/
).  Hale's ATADRVR, which was MS-DOS based and 
not threaded or asynchronous at all, did the following after every 
command execution (sent taskfile to hardware):
	if (device is ATAPI)
		sleep(150 ms)
Overall, I've no clue what to do on older PATA hardware, so my 
"insightful" suggestions are largely (a) follow drivers/ide code and/or 
(b) listen to any old fogies with deep historical knowledge.
