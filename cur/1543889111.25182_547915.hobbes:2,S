Sorry about that :-(. Was a busy day & skipped a few emails :-(.
Indeed with Christoph's patch (over the hg commit 57109:745e2df8ec60), without
CONFIG_SLUB_DEBUG, but with CONFIG_PROVE_LOCKING only under the kernel
debugging section, on CONFIG_SMP the slub kerenel is quite stable. (It's
running some stress tests now, but things are looking good.)
(If you want me to test it with other slub or kernel debug options please let
me know. It just takes a lot of time to eliminate the variables, if there are
problems.)
Thanks folks.
