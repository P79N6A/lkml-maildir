I made some tests with dbench:
IBM x440: 8 CPUs hyperthreaded = 16 CPUs (Xeon at 1.4 Ghz)
with percpu_counter:
        Throughput 188.365 MB/sec 16 procs
        Throughput 226.164 MB/sec 32 procs
        Throughput 142.913 MB/sec 64 procs
with atomic_long_t:
        Throughput 194.385 MB/sec 16 procs
        Throughput 237.273 MB/sec 32 procs
        Throughput 160.751 MB/sec 64 procs
