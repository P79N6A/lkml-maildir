Why should something bad happen in this case? (unless it happens in the
IPI handler for the SMP lock vector, but I've duplicated the spinlock
and apic-ack code to avoid using the fixups).
I've just noticed another problem instead: we might have a CPU waiting
with interrupts disabled for the CPU executing the fixup.
This could be fixed by waiting for a limited amount of iterations and
then emulating the instruction, but it makes the code even uglier.
We might get deadlocks on NMIs but that would also happen if we e.g. get
a memory parity NMI inside printk (deadlock on logbuf_lock). Should both
bugs be fixed?

That wouldn't work for compiler-generated prefetches (unless you
preprocess the compiler output) and would enlarge the kernel.
However, it would be significantly cleaner.

Even if we fixup at runtime this won't work since we the fixed up
instructions won't fault.
To handle this, we would need to keep the table around, stop CPUs and
fixup.
Anyway this scenario is quite unlikely.
