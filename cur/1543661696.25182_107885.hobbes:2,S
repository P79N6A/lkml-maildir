What submodel options are you using?  If you're compiling with
-march=i386, I wouldn't expect -Os to have much effect.
Note that, of all architectures, GCC is almost certainly most
efficient on IA-32.  Although I haven't done any benchmarks against
other compilers on $arch!=IA32, the ones I've seen claim that the
native compiler generates much better code.
John.
