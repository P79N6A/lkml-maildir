Hi,
I tried to find some explanation to this in the kernel archive but no luck
so far.
I have dual P III 600 machine which sometimes gives me this error and then
hangs. Only power off/on helps out.
The kernel is 2.2.16
One thing that I discovered
/proc/interrupts :
           CPU0       CPU1       
  0:     537442          0          XT-PIC  timer
but on other dual machine with P III 500 the /proc/interrupts
           CPU0       CPU1       
  0:  851757136  881622518    IO-APIC-edge  timer
could this be one of the problems ?
Any help appreciated ... 
Janek Hiis
