looks good to me in principle. Fujita-san, do you have any principal

Also, this patch will interact with ia64 materially:
  Subject: [PATCH 9 of 9] ia64/x86/swiotlb: use enum dma_data_direciton in dma_ops
So we'll need a bit more confidence in the testing status of this queue, 
and we probably want to wait until Tony merged the pending .29 ia64 
changes, and also get an Ack from Tony for these bits:
