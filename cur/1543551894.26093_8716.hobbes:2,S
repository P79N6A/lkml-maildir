Same problem I have. I used to work for me and I have not changed anything.
But other people are complaining on problems to burn faster than speed=4 and
I can't even see the drive ??
On the other hand I can mount the drive as a ide-cd something I guess should
not be possible if the ide-scsi thing really worked.
I just classified it as a user error. hmm this is what I get in my log.
