    Possibly not.   I'll find out when 2.4 comes out (I can crash a
    2.3.x kernel pretty simply even if it's compiled with 2.7.2.3,
    so I couldn't accuse anyone of a crash.)

   Probably, but it didn't take much time to produce the patch.  If
   I was going to be anal about it, I'd hack out // handling in cpp,
   but that would break EVERYTHING the free software community has
   written in the last two years.
