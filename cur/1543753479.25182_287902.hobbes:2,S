Damn, yes.  I have it.  I don't consider those patches *that* important
that I instantly forward the stuff, they'll go out with the next batch
of v4l updates because it's less work that way.
If you want to have a look at my latest (not submitted yet) stuff check
out the video4linux cvs snapshots (
http://dl.bytesex.org/cvs-snapshots/
)
or (less frequently updated) the kernel patches @
http://dl.bytesex.org/patches/.
