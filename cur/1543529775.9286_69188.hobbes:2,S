There was some discussion of /dev/random on an ipsec
related list mentioning that new Intel h/w would have a built
in random number generator. I went looking, and managed to
find documentation for it ("Intel 82802 Firmware Hub: Random
Number Generator", 298029.pdf, from www.intel.com).
 Using it appears trivial, but I can't seem to figure out one
piece of info: the pseudo-code in it appears to assume that
the FWH is mapped into a known location, and the
documentation for the FWH ("Intel(R) 82802AB/82802AC
Firmware Hub (FWH)", 29065802.pdf) seems to imply
that how to do that is proprietary.
 Does anybody have any info on this? Are they not going
to make programming info for the FWH public? Any
chance of using this as another entropy source? Has
anybody looked at this?
 Sam
