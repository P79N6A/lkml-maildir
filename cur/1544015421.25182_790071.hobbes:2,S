So am I.  
http://kisskb.ellerman.id.au/kisskb/compiler/5/
 shows my latest
builds of both linux-next and Linus' tree are OK for defconfig and
allnoconfig (allmodconfig fails for a different reason).
What is different about the failing config (compiler)?  Are there other
configs it would be sensible to build test?
