This came up in a conversation about ieee1394_core.c.  In 2.5.3, the BKL 
is used to protect a module from being unloaded.  The code looks like this:
         lock_kernel();
         read_lock(&ieee1394_chardevs_lock);
         file_ops = ieee1394_chardevs[blocknum].file_ops;
         module = ieee1394_chardevs[blocknum].module;
         read_unlock(&ieee1394_chardevs_lock);
	...
         INCREF(module);
         unlock_kernel();
The question is, how can we keep the module from being unloaded between 
the file_ops assignment, and the INCREF.  Do we have a general purpose 
way, other than the BKL, to keep a module from being unloaded?  There is 
unload_lock, but it is static to module.c.  We can always make it 
global, but is there a better solution?
