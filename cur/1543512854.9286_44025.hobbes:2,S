Well, I don't see how this would help; after the serial is disabled via
MSR 0x119 magic, it can't be re-enabled until you reboot..  Ploping the
data to a file in /proc owned by root with 0400 perms would probably be
the best thing if it needs to be accessed  (someone _has_ to have a use
for it), but it has to be read and saved before it's disabled..
As a side note, most bioses allow it to be disabled at boot time (mine
included), and I would rather linux left the bit twiddling to me.. but I
guess I can just go comment out the relevant lines :)
Also, reading MSRs works fine (as a normal user) with the rdmsr
instruction; I haven't tried writing them though (I would hope that isn't
allowed in userland)
