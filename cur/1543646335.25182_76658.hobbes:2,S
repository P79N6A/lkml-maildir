Of course they sell CVS. I give them money, they give me a CD, that CD 
has CVS on it.
If I have a support contract with that distro and CVS breaks they will 
fix it.
I don't doubt if I went to the various distros with money in hand for 
extra features for CVS they would put them in.

Yeah I understand what your intent is and I'm not flaming you. I have a 
problem with the wording in that claus.  Unfortunately you're not a 
lawyer so your stated intent means little, it's the language in the 
license that has meaning.
