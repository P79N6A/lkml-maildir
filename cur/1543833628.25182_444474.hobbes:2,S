Hmmm... I don't see anything that sticks out in the sysrq info (well,
not sure if the do_wp_page() is just trace junk or not - CC'ed Peter
just in case). Maybe this is related to the expand files OOM thing that
Martin saw?
If you boot w/ init=/bin/bash do you also see the hang? If you execute
"date" a few times, does it seem to keep proper track of time?
Also could you enable softlockup detection? (CONFIG_DETECT_SOFTLOCKUP)
Which you can find under Kernel debugging in the make menuconfig.
thanks
