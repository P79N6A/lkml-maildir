hi list!
i was using getfdprm and i had some queries regarding that .. 
1. As getfdprm is a tool to procure FDD parameter (density or sector size)
and seems can be used by system support members's assessment etc, can you
tell me if it corresponds with LS-120 or not.
Including the other tools like fdrawcmd, floppymeter etc. , If you are aware
of the possibilities of their usage in LS-120/LS-240, please add that also.
2. How much is the scope for applicability in LS-120 ?
Thanx In Advance,
rajiv.
