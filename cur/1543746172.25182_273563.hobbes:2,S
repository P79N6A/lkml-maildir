Yes, I think that's whats happening, except that I think the blocked
signal list is per thread as well.  The shared sighand structure just
has the saved arguments from sigaction, as I remember.   (It's confusing:
the set of signals blocked during execution of the signal handler is
part of the sigaction structure and hence is global to the entire
thread group, whilst the set of signals blocked in general is per thread.)

Definately: siglock.  All of the profiling ticks occur at
unlock_irqrestore(&p->sighand->siglock) in the routines I
mentioned before.  [we don't have NMI profiling on Altix...
so profiling typically can't look inside
of code sections with interrupts suspended.]

Yes, I was hoping to keep the current semantics of siglock as the lock for
all things signal, just make it local per thread, and require that all of the
siglocks be held to change the sighand structure.  That seemed like a change I
could manage.  My personal notion was that the slowdown of sigaction()
processing for multi-threaded POSIX programs was not that big of deal because
it doesn't happen very often, and for non-CLONE_SIGHAND threads the additional
cost would be minor.  But if the slowdown in the CLONE_SIGHAND case is not
acceptable then I'm stuck as to how to do this
