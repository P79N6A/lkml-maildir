The rule should be like this:
   List the lowest version number required to get
   2.2.xx-level features while running a 2.4.xx kernel.
Remember what the purpose of the table is. It is a list of REQUIRED
upgrades. Failure to upgrade should result in a broken system. So pppd
must be listed, since somebody changed the kernel API for 2.4.1.
If I run the mount command from Red Hat 6.2, using it as intended
for a 2.2.xx kernel, doesn't everything work? There won't be any
multi-mount confusion because 2.2.xx can't do that anyway. There
isn't any problem with NFSv3 either, since 2.2.xx lacks NFSv3.
Basically I ask: would existing scripts for a 2.2.xx kernel break?
If the old mount can still do what it used to do, then "mount" need
not be listed at all.
