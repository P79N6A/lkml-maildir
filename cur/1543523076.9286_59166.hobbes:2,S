The big thing I can think of is that you could run executables, read
files, even have files open for writing but not actually being written
to, on a filesystem that would periodically make sure its on-disk data
was consistent.  It's kind of hard to have the automounter unmount the
filesystem when any of those things happen.
The suggestion is appropriate not for use with infrequently referenced
filesystems (autofs works fine there), but infrequently *written*
filesystems.
