You know, I dislike this.
The right fix is to hack gcc to allow functions (in this case, BUG()) to have
an "unlikely" attribute, and therefore know that this branch is unlikely.
Making code slightly less readable for minor (and hopefully temporary)
optimizations is IMHO not a worthy use of your time.
Quick!  To the GCC sources!  Run!
Rusty.
