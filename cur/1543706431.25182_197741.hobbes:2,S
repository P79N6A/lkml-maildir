The best way to avoid this sort of problem is to change "fdisk" (and
mkfs and fsck and ...) to (optionally) open the device with O_EXCL.
In 2.6, a device that is "claimed" by a kernel subsystem - ie is
mounted, or is part of an MD or DM array, or has a partition which is
claimed in one of these ways, cannot be opened O_EXCL.
So these tools that operate on block devices and expect exclusive
access should ask for it.
They probably should have a way to not use O_EXCL if the admin
promises they know what they are doing, as fsck does need to run on a
mounted partition some times, and fdisk can reasonably be used on
devices with mounted partitions.  But the default should be O_EXCL.
