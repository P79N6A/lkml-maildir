Wow, you don't have to do all that.  The following /etc/lilo.conf boots nt
workstation 4.0 sp4 on ntfs filesystem just fine:
boot=/dev/sda
map=/boot/map
install=/boot/boot.b
prompt
timeout=50
vga=ask
image=/boot/vmlinuz
	label=linux
	root=/dev/sdb1
	read-only
        append="aic7xxx=ultra,tag_info:{{12,12}},verbose"
image=/boot/vmlinuz.good
	label=linux.good
	root=/dev/sdb1
	read-only
        append="aic7xxx=ultra,tag_info:{{12,12}},verbose"
image=/boot/vmlinuz.old
	label=linux.old
	root=/dev/sdb1
	read-only
        append="aic7xxx=ultra,tag_info:{{12,12}},verbose"
other=/dev/sda1
	label=nt
	table=/dev/sda
	
...all I have to do is type "nt" at the lilo boot prompt.
