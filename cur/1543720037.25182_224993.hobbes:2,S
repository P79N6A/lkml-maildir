  The build time check was your idea in the first place, as I recall.
  I hadn't added it to my variants.  Apparently we agree not to add it.
  Ok.

  I absolutely agree with your dislike of hidden intermittent failures.
  For a constant failure such as this, even if everyone misses the
  botch for the first few times that SGI boots a bazillion CPU system
  in the lab, it will get noticed soon enough.  This is in fact
  exactly what happened with the 99 char limit that was there now.

  That looks nice.
  If you want me to add the "if (len ..."  check, let me know.
  Or if you want to send Andrew a patch that adds it, I'll
  gladly support that.
  ==> Do note that I had to change the -1UL to PAGE_SIZE, in a
      patch to Andrew about 12 hours ago.  The *scnprintf()
      family of fine formatting functions suppresses all requested
      output if handed a length with the high bit set.

  Yup - I think it was Greg who said the same thing.  Clearly this is
  not a panic.
  I was wrong to suggest panic'ing here.

  Ok - have fun.

  Whatever ... my view of who was saying and doing what here doesn't
  entirely match yours.
  So be it.
