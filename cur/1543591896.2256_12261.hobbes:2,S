I've already done it, however not as a 2.4 solution. The partial and WIP
patches is here:
*.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/axboe/v2.5/bio-7
Block driver can indicate the need for bounce buffers above a certain
page.
Of course I can hack up something for 2.4 as well, but is this really a
pressing need?
