Uhh, the whole point of a journal is that when the computer goes down
hard and doesn't have a chance to clean up.  If you put the journal on
a ramdisk, you might as well just mount it as an ext2 filesystem and
be done with it.  Without the journal _on_disk_ you get no data or
filesystem reliability advantages.  If you're after speed, just forgo
the reliability or buy better disks.
