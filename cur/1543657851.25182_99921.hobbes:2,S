Did you test on a true i386, which needs exception handling very early on 
to handle the test for broken WP? In other words, are all the exception 
table data structures properly initialized?
And did you check that an oops in the init handling works correctly before
the kallsyms table has been initialized? That "initcall(symbol_init)"  
makes me suspect it won't..
There was a reason why "extable_init()" was in init/main.c, and was done 
_early_.
