It does already. 
Just see the most indented check there. It tries to find a struct page from the
page frame number (pfn_to_page) after obtaining the  pfn from the pte.
This check is only done, if it is a valid pfn (pfn_valid()) of a present
pte.
Since make_pages_present uses get_user_pages(), which in turn calls
follow_pages() with the above checks, this is properly checked.
The only path where is is NOT checked, is hugetlb stuff. So the error must be
there.
If somebody does the changes, please remove the useless get_page_map(), since
it just does the above checks done already again after a reverse lookup and I
could not find ANY case, where the check in get_page_map() would fail. 
So maybe a BUG_ON() the checks in get_page_map() and a LTP run combinded with
bttv usage afterwards would be good.
