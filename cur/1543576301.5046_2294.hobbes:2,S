Subject: [PATCH] e820 memory detection fix for ThinkPad

  Hi Alan, lkml-readers,
  This is a tiny patch to make the int15/e820 memory mapping work on IBM
ThinkPads. Until now, I have had to give lilo a mem= option with one meg
of RAM less than I actually have, so ACPI events don't overwrite any
data. The only alternative was to use one of the patches available on
http://www.pell.portland.or.us/~orc/Memory/,
 but these are quite big. I
tracked down the problem, at least for the ThinkPad 600X (2645-4EU), to
arch/i386/boot/setup.S: apparently the bios doesn't retain the value of
register %edx, so after the first entry is read the ascii word `SMAP' is
lost and further entries won't be recognized. The solution is simple,
just move the assignment 6 lines down so it's inside the loop that is
done for every entry.
  This patch is for 2.4.0-test7..12, but it should work for pre13
kernels and even 2.2 kernels with the memory map backport:

and that's without a mem= option to lilo, of course. May I suggest you
try this patch in the next 2.[24]-pre kernel? Thanks!
  BTW: I work for IBM, but I'm not in the PC department (or even
ThinkPad development). Unfortunately I won't be able to answer all your
IBM-related questions...
  BTW2: I'm not on the linux-kernel mailing list, so please reply to
