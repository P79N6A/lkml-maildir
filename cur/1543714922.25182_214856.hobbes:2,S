I've got a report of a similar oops, also using ifplugd. User in question (on 
IRC) is complaining that this has been happening for all of 2.6, in late 2.5 
(hasn't pinpointed any specific version) and in 2.4 since about 2.4.23.
Unfortunately in his case, it dies processing interrupts, so he gets nothing 
on disk, and is reluctant to set up a serial console on his box. I've tried 
emulating it here, but as yet have had no luck in getting it to oops.
Note: He's using an Intel EEPro/100B in his box, though he has a spare 
(unused) Realtek 8029 in there as well.
BTW: Kernel & ifplugd versions might be useful.
