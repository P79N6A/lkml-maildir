Not sure really.  It is correct in 2.2.x, and 2.6.x, but is
wrong in all 2.4.x kernels starting with 2.4.0, but I havn't
bothered finding exactly which kernel broke things.

I highly doubt anything relies on this.  Glibc checks for this
case before the syscall is made.  I found the bug while running
some the ltp testsuite on uClibc.  I have since added a check to
workaround the bug. but I would prefer to have it fixed properly
in the kernel.

Only if you plan to ignore the locked spinlock.  :-)
The 2.2.x code does this:
	-current->blocked = new_set;
	+if (!error)
	    current->blocked = new_set;
I condiered that, but I thought it better to make the code 
more closely match 2.6, which looked a bit nicer.
