I thought it was the addresses you'd object to.
I was thinking I'd follow up with a patch to make things
a bit more logical as far as info exposure goes. It makes
no sense to have the /proc/*/exe link fail a readlink()
when one can reliably guess that data from elsewhere.
I notice that Fedora Core 4 shipped with /proc/*/smaps
files that were readable, but /proc/*/maps files that were
not readable. (at least, a recent kernel update did)
As of now, I'm keeping mainstream kernel policy as is.
