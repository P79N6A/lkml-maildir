You call that numerical name space neat?  IMHO it was a totally bogus
idea. There is already a perfectly fine file system name space, why
add another one?
Anyways, imho the right solution is to remove the numerical
sysctl infrastructure (including most of sysctl.h), but keep
sys_sysctl() with a small mapping table that maps the few
numerical sysctls (mostly KERN_VERSION) that are actually used to 
path names internally. The rest should be ENOSYS.
