And I ran for really long with the 2.3.3 without any problem, and I am
just asking for when it will be included in the kernel tree?
If haven't compiled 2.3.9, because 2.3.9 not patched was already a problem,
but not 2.3.10 (in fact less: not working vfat... not that important...).
And also what about other PIII patches, like Doug Ledford?
Thanks!
Please, don't cc to me: I am on the list...
