BUG REPROT
I have found a little bug in the kernel source.
Instruction: "mov ds,ax" repeated 2 times, so the 2nd instruction is
for nothing.
kernel version:  2.2.13, but I think it's still in the newer kernels 
too.
file: /arch/i386/boot/setup.S
lines: 345-346 (these lines are the same)
FIX: erase line 345 or 346.
Please answer.
Greetings:
