Ingo,
Did something change recently in the VM that made copy_pte_range and
clear_page_range a lot more expensive?  I noticed a reference in the
"Page Table Iterators" thread to excessive overhead introduced by
aggressive page freeing.  That sure looks like what is going on in
trace2.  trace1 and trace3 look like big fork latencies associated with
copy_pte_range.
This is all with PREEMPT_DESKTOP.
