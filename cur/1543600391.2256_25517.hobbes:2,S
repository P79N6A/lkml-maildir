Well, I agree that this is not desirable. I am not sure whether
the right course is
 (a) to avoid getting here,
 (b) to do traditional page_launder() stuff, i.e. write stuff out,
     and hope that fixes it
 (c) to actively go defragment (Daniel P's prefered approach)
 (d) some combination of the above.

OK, I'm getting confused.
I'm looking at stuff you sent like:
Aug 29 13:43:34 admin kernel: pid=1207; __alloc_pages(gfp=0x20, order=3, ...)
Aug 29 13:43:34 admin kernel: Call Trace: [_alloc_pages+22/24] [__get_free_pages+10/24] [<fdcec826>] [<fdcec8f5>] [<fdceb7d7>]

If you use rsize=1024,wsize=1024, (note you may have to force
this at the client end), you should not see, at least from NFS,
allocations at greater than order 0. So if the problem is /just/
fragmentation (rather than too little memory), it will magically
go away (i.e. be hidden). If it's not just fragmentation, you
will still see errors. This is not intended as a solution, but
as a diagnostic tool. [I mistakenly thought/dreamed you had
already done this].
Note there may still be other things trying to do >0 order
allocs, for instance bounce buffers, but I believe you have
applied useful patches for them already.
