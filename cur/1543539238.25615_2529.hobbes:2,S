  Hi, all. I thought I'd try 2.4.0-test5-pre2 with my CardBus card and
see if it works yet. No such luck (my PCMCIA card does, though).
I plugged in an Ositech Jack of Spades CardBus. These are the kernel
messages:
PCI: Enabling device 03:00.0 (0000 -> 0003)
PCI: Found IRQ 11 for device 03:00.0
PCI: The same IRQ used for device 00:04.0
PCI: Failed to allocate resource 0 for PCI device 10b8:0006
  failed root[1400:14ff] min[1000] size[100]
  failed res[1800:14ff]
PCI: Enabling device 03:00.1 (0000 -> 0003)
PCI: Found IRQ 11 for device 03:00.1
PCI: The same IRQ used for device 00:04.0
PCI: The same IRQ used for device 03:00.0
and this is the output of lspci:

03:00.0 Ethernet controller: Standard Microsystems: Unknown device 0006 (rev 01)
03:00.1 Serial controller: Standard Microsystems: Unknown device 0006 (rev 01)
I've got all my PCMCIA/CardBus drivers configured as loadable modules.
So, is this a bug with the PCI code which is disallowing interrupt
sharing, or is something else wrong? Better yet, is there a patch
floating around?
