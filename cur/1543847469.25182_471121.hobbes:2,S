Well, uhh, actually...
All presently-supported architectures do exactly that.  Well, some do:
   typedef unsigned int __u32;
   #ifdef __KERNEL__
   typedef __u32 u32;
   #endif
It might be possible to clean up the types.h files a bit with  
something like the following in linux/types.h (nearly identical code  
is found in all of the asm-*/types.h files):
   typedef unsigned char  __u8;
   typedef   signed char  __s8;
   typedef unsigned short __u16;
   typedef   signed short __s16;
   typedef unsigned int   __u32;
   typedef   signed int   __s32;
   #if defined(CONFIG_ARCH_HAS_64BIT_WORD)
   typedef unsigned long  __u64;
   typedef   signed long  __s64;
   #elif defined(__GNUC__)
   __extension__ typedef unsigned long long __u64;
   __extension__ typedef   signed long long __s64;
   #endif
   #ifdef __KERNEL__
   typedef __u8  u8;
   typedef __s8  s8;
   typedef __u16 u16;
   typedef __s16 s16;
   typedef __u32 u32;
   typedef __s32 s32;
   typedef __u64 u64;
   typedef __s64 s64;
   #endif
With that you could delete ~30 lines from each of the various asm-*/ 
types.h files in exchange for 3 lines in each of the various arch/*/ 
Kconfig files.
I'll try to whip up a quick patch later today if I get the time.
Cheers,
Kyle Moffett
