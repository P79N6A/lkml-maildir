This isn't really an attempt at a clustering optimization.  The problem at
hand is that buffer cache buffers can be on relatively random pages.  So, a
page might have buffers that are very far apart, where one needs flushing
and the other doesn't.
In the blocksize == page size case, this won't happen, and we don't lose
any speed over the existing code.  In the blocksize < pagesize case, my new
code is slower, so my goal is to fix just that problem.
Real write clustering would be a different issue entirely, and is worth
doing ;-)
