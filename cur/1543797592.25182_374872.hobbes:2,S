Well, so what's your point? Germans and Netherlands tend to steal
software? Be it, but thses countries aren't socialistic at all...

What *may* be true is that possibly European mentality towards
"Intellectual Property" is somewhat different to the US. I've learned
to gain strength by sharing something (esp. knowledge) in a community
and not to basically try to de-share knowledge, making it a rare good.
Give a man a fish, he'll have food for the day. Teach a man fishing
and he'll have food for all his life.  You probably know that
sentence. You seem to not distinguish between enforced sharing and
willfull sharing. That's where the problems arise.

Really?  People, esp. the younger ones, really tend to get quite a lot
of political input. Just look at hot political topics that are
discussed in the media as well as at the school like the way the US
government (as well as some European governments) try to do their nice
war against terror and where it affects our daily life.

I think you totally over-estimate the goal of GPL and/or FOSS. This is
what it's *not*:
  - Kill commercial markets. (Though it'll bring PITA to some
    commercial vendors that will need to compete with FOSS.)
  - World domination. (There's always some granny loving Win3.1 so
    there's always at least one {BSD,Linux,...} compatible computer
    not running it. Also, would you as a FOSS programmer like to
    support all these John McDummy users that cannot handle a
    computer at all?)
Though, it is (besides other things):
  - A lot of *personal* fun for some single, technically-skilled
    programmers that like to hack software and present their work.
  - A way to earn money (I've worked at a company using Linux and the
    whole GNU stack of software for several years).
So not the whole worls spins around earning money. A lot of motivation
(especially speaking for myself) is just about programming,
self-teaching as well as teaching others and allowing others to use my
work (for money or not for money), as long as they use my rules (which
basically is: use it if you want, don't hide the details and give
something back, please.)
