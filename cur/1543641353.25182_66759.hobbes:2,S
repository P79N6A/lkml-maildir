The subject says it all. 
2.5.32 doesn't boot when using nfsroot.
same systems running fine with 2.4.19/2.5.31
SYSTEMS:
   athlon with/without preempt. (flatbak)
   i586 with preempt.           (cam029205)
The relevant configs/dmesg/lspci are on 
cam029208.student.utwente.nl/~caligula. 
SYMPTOMS:
I'm using loadlin to load the kernels. I see the kernel loading,unzipping 
and then...black screen followed by reboot.
