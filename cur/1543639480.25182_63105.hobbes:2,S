Staring at too many horrific profile outputs does that to one.
These are *the* two big locks.

The buddy info is all in one cacheline and the LRU info is in another.
So there's no loss to PIII here.  But those two things are soooo hot
that paranoia is warranted.

No, I haven't.  NUMA boxes don't need it if the node-local allocation is
working right. But if they go cross-node much, it'll help.  On high-performance
UMA SMP, allowing those two particular locks to fall into the same cacheline
is a big goofup.
