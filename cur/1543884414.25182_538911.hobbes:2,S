There are 128-processor IA64 systems which run recent 2.6 kernels out
there; the per-processor counters, RCU and page-fault scalability work
has been instrumental to the necessary scaling for decent resource
usage on these.
IIRC, there were some patches being developed to improve pagecache
scalability lately too, but I guess it all depends on what kind of
workload you have...
