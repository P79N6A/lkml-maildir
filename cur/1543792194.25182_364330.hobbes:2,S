FGLRX won't function at all with 2.6.14 and requires patching to work with 
2.6.13.
And your right there are PCI-E issues.. the cards work but no direct 
rendering is supported although I did see some patches head to Linus that 
fix that. (waiting for the next pre release so mine will work.. I should 
really sit down and learn GIT)
