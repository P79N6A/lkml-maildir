it's probably safer to use crc32_le() or crc32_be(), depends on which 
one exactly you need.

Use a recent kernel, there crc32(), crc32_le() and crc32_be() are 
implemented as library functions.

Enabling CONFIG_MODVERSIONS causes even more troubles, just browse the 
LinuxDVB mailing list archives, you'll find hundrets of mails where 
people failed to install standalone drivers just because they/their 
friends/their distributor didn't managed it to install matching kernel 
source, kernel config and kernel image.
