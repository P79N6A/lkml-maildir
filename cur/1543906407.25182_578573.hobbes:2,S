Actually, that was my machine. Omnibook xe3; BIOS provided trip points
*did* kill the disk. At least I was able to work around it with
writing to trip points.
Yes, ACPI mandates emergency shutdown when critical+delta point is
reached, *in hardware*. So this only endangers very broken machines,
and it also fixes lot of them.
