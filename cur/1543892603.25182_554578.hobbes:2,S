	Hardware problem.  You need a new system board.  I had this
problem on my T41, devices would sometimes work, sometimes not
(depending on the reboot).  If I plugged in a USB 1.1 hub, then pluged
the memory reader into the hub, it would always work at 1.1 speeds.
	New system board, USB 2.0 works just fine.
