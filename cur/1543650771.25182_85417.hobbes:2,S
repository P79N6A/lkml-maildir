A dump mechanism within the kernel is a base for much easier
kernel debugging.
IMHO, analyzing a dump is much more effective than guessing
a kernel bug solely with help of an oops message.
Using lkcd/lcrash, I've debugged enough problems in
kernel modules that were otherwise quite hard to determine.
It is hard to understand why developers do not want the
aid of dump/dump-analysis for kernel development.
