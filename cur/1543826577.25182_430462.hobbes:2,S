Well, we _could_, and I guess that we'd get things acceptably sorted out in
time for release.  But it'll be pretty chaotic and we don't want chaos
happening in Linus's tree.
I don't think there's any rush here - the code is only now reaching
sort-of-ready-for-mm status.  And..
- I think we still have a problem with the raid/bdev changes in
  block_dev.c.
- the changes to block_dev.c _do_ impact non-lockdep kernels
- we need to take a second look to see which other
  dont-affect-non-lockdep-kernels patches are in fact affecting non-lockdep
  kernels
- the changes to block_dev.c were pretty awful anyway
- did the various review comments I sent get disposed of in some fashion?
My overarching concern is the rate at which false-positive workaround
patches are piling up.  At some point we need to step back and decide
whether the goodness justifies the badness.  I expect we'll be OK, but I
don't think we're yet in a position to know that for sure.
(I'm actually quite surprised at how few real bugs this checker has
revealed.  We must rock, or something).
