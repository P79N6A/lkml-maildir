The problem is that something is keeping these files open, and the
space cannot be freed until the process exits (or closes the files).
You can use lsof to tell you which files are open, and which process is
using them.  If it is your own code that is causing this problem, you
need to ensure that you close all of the files that you open when you
are done with them.
The reiserfs journal is a fixed size, so it cannot be that.
Note also that on reiserfs, if you have such a process which keeps
files open after they are deleted and then you have a crash, the file
is "orphaned" and the space is "lost" until you run reiserfsck again.
It may be that Chris Mason's patch for this is in the latest kernels,
but it may not be, and it might not be in the kernel you are running.
Cheers, Andreas
