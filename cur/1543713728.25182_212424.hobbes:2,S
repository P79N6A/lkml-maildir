I know in 2.4 kernel Linux could not access the last
sector of a hard disk if it were odd.
Combing the archives shows there was some possible
work being done on this for 2.6.
However, I can't find anything confirming this has
either been fixed in 2.6 or is still on the TODO list.
Has the block layer been fixed such that hard disks
with an odd sector count can be fully accessed within
Linux (access the last sector)?
kind regards,
