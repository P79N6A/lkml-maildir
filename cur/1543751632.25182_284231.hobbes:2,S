As mentioned before we only unexported symbols were we were pretty clear
that all users of it are indeep utterly broken.  I got about a dozend
replies for this patches, and for more than half of it where the reporter
was either the author or the module was opensource I could help them to
actually fix their code.  In this case the code is far more broken than
the others, but we've even been trying to help them fix their code for
more than a year, but IBM folks have been constanly refusing.

But as long as IBM people don't fix their %$^%! they'll continue annoying
us and the Distibutors about adding more and more hacks for it, and other
people will write similarly crappy code using it again and making the
removal even more difficult.

Hey, you got messages in this thread from half a dozen kernel contributors
here and still stand against all of them and for IBM who's violating our
copyrights that don't allow non-propritary derived works from it which
any user of these deeply-internal modules clearly is.
I don't know nor care nor want to speculate over anyones motives, but the
situation is at least strange enough to deserve a little sarcastic anekdote.
