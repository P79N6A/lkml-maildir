True I guess. But do you want to live in a software environment where as 
a matter of course every distribution out there puts its "value-add" in 
custom system calls and creating a $DISTRIBUTION-only userspace? After 
all, if nothing uses their shiny new custom syscall, they might as well 
not add it. This would fragment Linux quite horribly and IMO cases where 
this happens should be _dis_ couraged, not encouraged by making it less 
problematic to survive the resulting mess.
Rene.
