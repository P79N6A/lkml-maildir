Sure. But the most sad thing is there seems to be not so much savings
in this (unless a company isn't sure of its near future). Trying to
upgrade and test current products with current kernels, even if not
necessary, should be always useful and make developing of new products
faster and better fit (and of course, BTW, make the kernel better on
time).
