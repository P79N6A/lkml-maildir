Maybe...  I suppose it's an implementation issue, because the lack of
signedness issues is probably only noticeable after data value analysis.
Playing devil's advocate here, I actually don't mind it warning for a
scenarion like this, because quite often it indicates an area where, if
s/int/unsigned int/ is performed, the compiler could potentially do a
better job of optimizing.
I agree your above specific example shouldn't trigger a warning
[implementation excuses aside].
