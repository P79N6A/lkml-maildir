Stephen and James, despite their clear bias towards SELinux, do try to
give good feedback.  But you are right, there's not enough active help
for people trying to make a contribution to get their code in shape.
Many of the modules that come along have been misguided conceptually,
but I think that e.g. apparmor, tomoyo, smack could use that kind
of constructive help to get into final mergable shape.  Personally,
I haven't spent nearly enough time reviewing those, my apologies to
those developers.  So, yes, help is welcome.
thanks,
