I have ingoing transactions (with that I mean including sending
replys).  I can for example read the cycle counter from another
machine.  I sort of have outgoing transactions (means the code is
there, except it always crashes on me so far).

I have looked a lot at your subsystem.  I first tried to implement a
Lynx driver that fits into your subsystem but gave up after a few
hours.

I have designed a subsystem already, at least the mid level (core
implementation) and low level (hardware driver) and all the interfaces
between them.  And I have most of the code.
The high level stuff is something that is yet to be designed, but that
is mostly node identifying and passing of bus events (resets, node is
lost...).
> * we then see what we have and how to migrate existing code 
Your code has all the FireWire stuff inside and interlaced with the AIC
hardware driver.  You have mostly copied code from the SCSI subsystem
without understanding why something is there and have therefore moved
all the cruft from the SCSI subsystem (which is badly designed as most
developers on the kernel list agree).  Reusing something of that would
have taken more effort than to just rewrite it and add the missing
pieces.

No point against that.  It's just that I didn't need much of that yet.

So what?  You can easily add new hardware drivers to my subsystem.  i
would actually be glad if you could migrate your Adaptec code to my
subsystem.  As I said in a mail I sent you some time I ago it would
actually greatly simplify your driver because you can leave out all
FireWire stuff and transaction code (basically the driver gets
pre-built packets for sending and simply dumps the receive buffer to
the core code plus all the little stuff like bus resets).  And no more
of that SCSI subsystem like templates through headers, which really
suck.
