It's well defended :)) The only service visible to the outside world is NS.
All the packets leaves the system with an address which is not even an
ethernet. Actually, it's one of loopback adresses.
And EVERY host with ANY system can be taken down with e.g. ReGet in fully
legitimate fashion.

I wanna tell once more that I'm not for a blood. And I don't want to call
anybody a liar. I'm just pretty sure that e.g. for RAID5 that xor.c is
simply forgotten. It's not a rocket science to notice that this file is
included in a Makefile and missing in a source tree. I'm sure this is the
trivial omission. I'm just wonder why haven't somebody spotted it? And I can
sketch the scenario how can all that code be compileable on Ingo's machine
and not compileable by anyone else :)) Sorry if I hit somebody - I did no
want to. Nothing personal, just business :))
But I wanna know what lies behind the changed /proc/*/cmdline. Can anybody
throw some light? It's definitely wrong and have to be fixed in one place in
kernel rather than fixing several dozens decent apps using setproctitle().
Does anybody know what the hell it have been done for?
