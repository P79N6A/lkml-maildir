Subject: [PATCH 14/61] PM: Remove prev_state from struct dev_pm_info
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/7/11/544

From: Rafael J. Wysocki <rjw@sisk.pl>
The prev_state member of struct dev_pm_info (defined in include/linux/pm.h) is
only used during a resume to check if the device's state before the suspend was
'off', in which case the device is not resumed.  However, in such cases the
decision whether or not to resume the device should be made on the driver level
and the resume callbacks from the device's bus and class should be executed
anyway (the may be needed for some things other than just powering on the
device).
