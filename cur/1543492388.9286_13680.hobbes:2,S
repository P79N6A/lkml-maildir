All you need to do is make an installable driver. Installable drivers are
easy in Linux. One of my co-workers has a good working generic template
that he might volunteer to send you. At the application level, the
driver will look like a serial device. Your Winmodem driver should
probably handle many of the de-facto standard 'AT' commands. If you
are successful, you will be rewarded with much rich praise.
Incidentally, Installable drivers in Linux can be installed and
uninstalled from a running machine. You never have to reboot during
development unless you accidentally poke a hole in the kernel.
Cheers,
