Try `mount -o relatime' and prepare to be surprised ;)

I think the situation is that we've asked for some additional
what-can-be-hurt-by-this testing.
Yes, we could sling it out there and wait for the reports.  But often
that's a pretty painful process and regressions can be discovered too late
for us to do anything about them.
