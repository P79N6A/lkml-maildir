Well that bit compiles.

This thing's running RHAS2.1 which I think dates from before the invention
of the transistor.  Running home-made gcc-3.3.2 and binutils-2.14.90.0.6-1.
I'll send along the three elf.h's under /usr/include.

Dunno yet - I didn't do the normal batch of cross-compiles due to spending
six hours chasing down new bugs.

That fixes the modpost.c compile, but the new futex stuff fails because
ia64 doesn't implement ptr_to_compat().  In fact only three architectures
appear to do so.
