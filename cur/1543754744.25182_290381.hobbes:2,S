Myths are not really involved here. The IBM PC hardware specifications
are fairly well defined and the various bits of "we glued a 2Mhz part
onto the bus" stuff is all well documented. Nowdays its more complex
because most kbc's aren't standalone low end microcontrollers but are
chipset integrated cells or even software SMM emulations.
The real test is to fish out something like an old Digital Hi-note
laptop or an early 486 board with seperate kbc and try it.
