Not wanting to contradict you, but are you completely sure that the
dragging you are hearing isn't actually a mild form of skipping?  ie if it
skips very slightly at regular intervals, this could sound like dragging?

Um?  I'm slightly confused here.  What excatly do you think is causing the
problem?

So the sb16 drags under network activity on 2.0.3x on one machine and
under heavy disk load on 2.2.x on another machine, yes?
It does sound like a resource conflict to me, but I assume you've checked
that.  Does the kernel know about both of the sb's dma channels?
