On the other hand, doing the cache flush at COW time is "kind of 
equivalent" to just doing it after the TLB flush. It's now just _much_ 
after the flush ;)
So maybe the COW D$ aliasing patch-series is just the right thing to do. 
Not worry about D$ at _all_ when doing the actual fork, and only worry 
about it on an actual COW event. Hmm?
