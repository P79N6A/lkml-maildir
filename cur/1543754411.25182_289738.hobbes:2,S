Alan, please don't let us loose focus!
I'm talking about  the classification of the opcodes
     a. GPCMD_SEND_KEY and
     b. GPCMD_SET_STREAMING
as only "save for write" in scsi_ioctl.c:verify_command()
since kernel version 2.6.8.
The intended security improvements of this restriction can be
completed circumvented by using
	a. cdrom_ioctl (..., DVD_AUTH,...) instead of
	b. cdrom_ioctl (..., CDROM_SEND_PACKET,...)
so the result is as described:
"no security improvements at the cost of broken software".
The changes looked random to me and I would like to see
a clear concept, which would drive the necessary changes for
improved security and stability.
I'm putting my finger on some loose ends below drivers/cdrom,
drivers/ide and drivers/block.
Regards,
Elias
