Hi all,
	I've been having stability problems with Linux for quite some time and
recently decided to try out the 2.3.x kernels instead of the 2.2.x that I
was previously using. Under 2.3.49 I noticed the following types of errors
both during boot and when running:
Mar  4 16:30:13 dual kernel: APIC error interrupt on CPU#0, should never
happen.
Mar  4 16:30:13 dual kernel: ... APIC ESR0: 00000008
Mar  4 16:30:13 dual kernel: ... APIC ESR1: 00000008
Mar  4 16:30:13 dual kernel: ... bit 3: APIC Receive Accept Error.
Mar  4 16:30:24 dual kernel: APIC error interrupt on CPU#1, should never
happen.
Mar  4 16:30:24 dual kernel: ... APIC ESR0: 00000008
Mar  4 16:30:24 dual kernel: ... APIC ESR1: 0000000a
Mar  4 16:30:24 dual kernel: ... bit 1: APIC Receive CS Error (hw problem).
Mar  4 16:30:24 dual kernel: ... bit 3: APIC Receive Accept Error.
Mar  4 16:30:27 dual kernel: APIC error interrupt on CPU#1, should never
happen.
Mar  4 16:30:27 dual kernel: ... APIC ESR0: 00000002
Mar  4 16:30:27 dual kernel: ... APIC ESR1: 0000000a
Mar  4 16:30:27 dual kernel: ... bit 1: APIC Receive CS Error (hw problem).
Mar  4 16:30:27 dual kernel: ... bit 3: APIC Receive Accept Error.
Mar  4 16:36:24 dual kernel: APIC error interrupt on CPU#0, should never
happen.
Mar  4 16:36:24 dual kernel: ... APIC ESR0: 00000008
Mar  4 16:36:24 dual kernel: ... APIC ESR1: 0000000c
Mar  4 16:36:24 dual kernel: ... bit 2: APIC Send Accept Error.
Mar  4 16:36:24 dual kernel: ... bit 3: APIC Receive Accept Error.
	So, the obvious questions are, what do these mean and how can I fix it.
I've spent the last few hours searching through the net for similar messages
and found quite a few instances in the linux-kernel archives. Almost all of
those instances were regarding PB6 motherboards which is not the case for
me. Also, I never saw are real solutions to the problem so that is why I am
asking here.
	I'm running on a Supermicro P6DBS motherboard. The MB support dual CPUs
and has a built-in AIC-7895 SCSI controller (apparently this also causes
some people problems). I currently have dual PIII 600s although I used to
have dual PII400s and had problems then as well. Also, currently I am not
using SCSI at all since that seems to increase instability.
	A few more pieces of information: I noticed that the errors seem to occur
more frequently when I'm running VMware. As of yet, with the 2.3.49 kernel,
I have not crashed. It has only been a few hours, however, so I'm not too
hopeful. Besides, the above error messages scare me.
	Any information on these errors and what to do to fix them would be
greatly appreciated.
Thank you,
--Rainer
