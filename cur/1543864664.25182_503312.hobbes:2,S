I can't imagine what such patches would be, unless maybe you're referring to
I2C framework updates that make it follow the driver model and support platform
specific data, like an RTC alarm's IRQ number?  Those will take some time.
Just submit a normal I2C driver for that RTC, and any IRQ capability can be
added later.  (Or as a board-specific patch, which seems to be the normal
solution for I2C, though they won't go upstream.)
