No - that's not what I said.  I said "power of two, from 1 to 2048
bytes excluding CRC."
To expand on that to make it crystal clear (I feel like I'm teaching
grandmother to suck eggs, but what the hell) that means 1, 2, 4, 8,
16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, and 2048 are the only possible block
sizes with MMCI.  All other block sizes can not be configured with
MMCI.

Since passwords are limited to a maximum of 16 characters, this means
that only passwords of length 2, 6, and 14 are possible with MMCI.
All other passwords are invalid and/or impossible with this host.
