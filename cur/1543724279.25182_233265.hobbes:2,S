Andrew,
Mark and I are able to reproduce this with the simple
program below.  The mmap() PROT_NONE is not giving a EFAULT
on read.  The test was mmap a PROT_NONE address and passing
that into the access() syscall and then looking for a
EFAULT.  Instead it was getting ENOENT.  We found that
by backing out the nx-update.patch from -mm1 patches
the problem went away.
The /proc/pid/maps looked like this:
without nx-update patch:
40017000-40018000 ---p 40017000 00:00 0
=====
with -mm1:
40017000-40018000 --xp 40017000 00:00 0
So it looks like the page being executable allows read
access.
Not sure why you do not see this on your machine.  This
fails on my 2-proc xeon box (and all the STP machines).
I can send more info if you need it.
Daniel (and Mark)
#include <unistd.h>
#include <errno.h>
#include <sys/mman.h>
main()
{
	char *p0 = 0;
	char *p1 = (char *)-1;
	char *p2;
	int err;
	p2 = mmap(0, 4096, PROT_NONE, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS, 0, 0);
	errno = 0;
	err = access(p0, R_OK);
	printf("access 0 ptr %p return code %d errno %d\n", p0, err, errno);
	perror("access result:");
	errno = 0;
	err = access(p1, R_OK);
	printf("access 1 ptr %p return code %d errno %d\n", p1, err, errno);
	perror("access result:");
	errno = 0;
	err = access(p2, R_OK);
	printf("access 2 ptr %p return code %d errno %d\n", p2, err, errno);
	perror("access result:");
