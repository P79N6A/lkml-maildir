Wouldn't a new scheduler be easier to test? And your patches changes
it's behavior quite a lot. Wouldn't they require the same testing?
(And Nicks for that mater, who changes more)

But, can't this scheduler suffer from starvation? If the run queue is
long enough? Either via that deadline or via processes not running...
Wouldn't a starved process boost ensure that even hogs on a loaded
system got their share now and then?
You could say that the problem the current scheduler has is that it's
not allowed to starve anything, thats why we add stuff to give
interactive bonus. But if it *was* allowed to starve but gave bonus to
the starved processes that would make most of the interactive detection
useless (yes, we still need the "didn't use their timeslice" bit and
with a timeslice that gets smaller the higher the pri we'd automagically
balance most processes).
(As usual my assumptions might be really wrong...)

Well, discussing and creating it is one thing. Implementing it is
another. Accepting the patch is still up to the-powers-that-be(tm)
