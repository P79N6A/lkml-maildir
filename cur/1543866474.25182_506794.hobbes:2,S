Will try.
I reverted to 2.6.19 w/o suspend/resume patch last weekend to make
sure on 2.6.19 forcedeth is stable and noticed something odd:
Because I didn't include the suspend/resume patch I obviously had to
a down/rmmod/modprobe/up cycle after each resume and I noticed that
the behaviour seems to alternate between resumes:
Behaviour 1:
  After modprobe I get two interface 'eth0' and 'eth1' for the two
  ports, as expected.
Behaviour 2:
  After modprobe I get one interface 'eth3' (which should be 'eth1')
  and one interface with increasing numbers (which should be 'eth0',
  last resume it was 'eth12' IIRC).
As I said if I get behaviour 1 on one resume I get behaviour 2 on
the next resume and vice versa.  That seems rather odd to me.
On a not quite related note, forcedeth shows a different ethtool
output (compared to e100), when no cable is connected to the port:

Note that e100 returns the lowest possible speed if no link is
detected, while forcedeth seems to return -1, which ethtool doesn't
seem to recognise as a valid response (I guess, why else would it
show the number after 'Unknown!').
