Subject: [PATCH 1/2 x86#stackprotector] x86: cleanup stack protector
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2009/1/27/467

Impact: cleanup
Make the following cleanups.
* remove duplicate comment from boot_init_stack_canary() which fits
  better in the other place - cpu_idle().
* move stack_canary offset check from __switch_to() to
  boot_init_stack_canary().

This was part of core/percpu branch before rebasing but really belongs
to stackprotector branch.
