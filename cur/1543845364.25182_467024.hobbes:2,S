Agreed it does tend to push the envelop of what is allowed, and doesn't
try to work around OS bugs.  Which does tend to expose things.

No. Did you not get the other part of the discussion?
The reservation was wrong because those IOAPICs were on ordinary pci
devices.  So the two reservations for the same resource conflicted,
so the pci allocator tried to move the pci device.
The problem is totally contained within the patch under discussion.
The role LinuxBIOS plays seems to be that it is atypical to enable
ioapics as ordinary pci devices.
