It better be valid for any OS-side access to the EC, otherwise the ACPI
global lock would be utterly useless.  The system vendor would have done its
own "global-lock-like" functionality without the need for an ACPI global
lock specification.
What is not clear to me is whether an ACPI DSDT method is on the "OS side"
or on the "SMM side" of the ACPI global lock.
