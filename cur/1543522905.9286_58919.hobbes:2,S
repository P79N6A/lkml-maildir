have You seen the current schedule() implementation ?
It's filled of goto to keep a linear CPU fast-path with blocks with lower
probability of execution
kept in tail of the function block.
To gain how in percent ?
My patch, IMVHO is more clear then goto jump-back solution, under normal
cases gives the same
results, while under I load gives much better performance.

Remeber that not always strategic decisions are taken by cultured ( in a
computer science sense ) persons,
otherwise Apple would defeat MSDOS and OS2 would defeat Windows 3.0.
Anyway I prefer stability too, but if You can have both, why not ?

Sorry I wouldn't have bothered a guru ;)
I've sure a lower experience then Your but I continue to prefer a high
threaded
application with fine grained locks.
It'll be prepared for well scaling SMP systems, that IMVHO will be the
future of computing,
rather than uniprocessor ones with 1e99 gates ;)
Anyway I'd like if You get a look at the patch.
I think that a logarithmic scheduler, bechmarks apart, helps Linux SMP to
scale better.
Cheers,
