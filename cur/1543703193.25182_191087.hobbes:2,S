Probably not worth the trouble as it's a weak symbol - it can't
interfere with anything. In the unlikely case that some other arch
intends to define it and fails to, well, they'll get sys_ni_syscall
instead. By that logic, I've done the same with some of the stuff I've
made conditional for x86, like sys_vm86 and the like.
