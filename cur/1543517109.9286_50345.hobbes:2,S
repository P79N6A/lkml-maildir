I'll try. It does not just go bang, the system death is not instant. The
problem is that the systems in question are not installed by my bed and not
equipped with life monitors which go buzzing when the system starts
to collapse... Usually it runs full steam when I'm around but found comatose
when I enter my workplace in the morning... But it have been caught
redhanded several times, so I do hope that I'd probably have a possibility
to investigate the case.
