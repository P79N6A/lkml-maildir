Hi LKML,
Thanks to Vojtech for some advice, I finally got something happening
with this.  Turns out I had to add support for a new model in alps.c,
the attached file does this successfully for my laptop.  It'd be nice to
have others test it, but I am yet to find anyone else who has this same
laptop, with the same mouse issues I have.
With this patch, I now get a functioning touchpad, including side
scrolling, circle scrolling, corner taps etc.  However, I did have to
ramp the configuration numbers up significantly from my old Thinkpad
with its synaptics touchpad.  Minspeed is now 0.8 and maxspeed is 10. 
Also the VertScrollDelta is 10.  I don't know whether these numbers are
crazy high, or just normal for the Alps though.
