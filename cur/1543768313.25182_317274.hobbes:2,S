I have 3 new beta drivers for the 5282 coldfire architecture.
They were designed against EMAC.Inc's SoM-5282EM module.
This is based on the MMU less 5282 processor 
They are as listed below:
The mcf_qspi driver, ported to the new 2.6 kernel and modularized it to allow 
stackability. Currently the new kobject methodology is not supported yet, cuz 
I don't really understand it yet.
A DS1305 driver which stacks on top of the qspi layer and provides a standard 
misc RTC interface (somewhat SoM-5282EM dependent at this point as it's chip 
selects a little weird).
And a CFNVRAM driver, which provides a simple small partitionless block 
interface to the internal RAM of the 5282 processor(which can be battery 
backed). 
They are available as stand-alone projects at
ftp://SoM
:sompublic@ftp.emacinc.com/SoM-5282EM/uClinux-projects
I'm going to try to get them into an official patch submission next week(I'm 
new to this process so please forgive my stumbles),
thx,
NZG.
