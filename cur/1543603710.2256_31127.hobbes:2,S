-ac5 did not help with long periods of frozen X syndrome.
A number of people suggested trying 2.4.11pre2 or later.
Unfortunately, I was unable to build 2.4.11pre4 and ext3.
Newest patch at 
http://www.uow.edu.au/~andrewm/linux/ext3/
is for 2.4.10 and that patch had more patch errors than I
could manage when applied to 2.4.11pre4.
I did however find another easy way to cause the problem to happen:
point netscape 4.78 at
http://www.uwsg.indiana.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0109.3/index.html
Do an edit/find on the word 'netcon'.
The second I press find, the X cursor is frozen for 8 seconds,
then moves a little bit, and then is frozen for another 50 seconds.
This is 2.4.10-ac5 on a K6-3/366 with 128MB RAM.
