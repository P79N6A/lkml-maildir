To be pedantic, the *copyrights* for certain software on his laptop
are owned by those people.  (Fortunately, they have been friendly
enough to engage in software quid-pro-quo with those rights.)

Even as straw men go, that is pretty incoherent.
First, end users buy and use the hardware in question.  It does not
belong to Tivo, so the analogy to his laptop fails there.
Second, the important access is not to the hardware, but to the bits
used to build the version of Linux that is distributed by Tivo.  This
is purely software.
Third, such a license would be neither a free software nor an open
source license.  No one argues it would be.
