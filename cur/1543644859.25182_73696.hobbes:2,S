fifo_batch=16 drops throughput slightly on tiobench, however it also
gives really really good interactive behaviour here. Using 32 doesn't
change that a whole lot, the throughput that is. This might just be
normal deviation between runs, more are needed to be sure.  Note that
I'm testing with the last_sec patch I posted, you should too.
BTW, for SCSI, it would be nice to first convert more drivers to use the
block level queued tagging. That would provide us with a much better
means to control starvation properly on SCSI as well.
