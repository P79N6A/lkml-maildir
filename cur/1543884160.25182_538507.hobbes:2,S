Oh my gawd, what a stupid hack.  Now we know what the MS interoperability
lab has been working on.

Conceivably we could address this in the filesystem without mucking other
things up.  But I'd have thought the simplest damage-control would be to
detect this pattern in samba and to then use glibc's fallocate().
At present glibc will emulate fallocate() by writing zeroes.  There are
patches floating about to implement fallocate in-kernel and if/when that
turns up and is supported in glibc, the modified samba will automatically
start to use it.
Are you sure there isn't some registry setting to prevent the CIFS client
from doing the client-side preallocation?
