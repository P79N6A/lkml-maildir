I seem to recall from theory that the 100HZ is human dependent. Any
higher and you would begin to notice delays from you input until
whatever program you're talking to responds. 
However in order to actually notice it you must have other programs
running that uses close to 100% CPU *AT LEAST AT THE SAME OR HIGHER
PRIORITY*. To test this, just running a couple of shells/script with
while [true;] won't slow you down until you aggressively renice the
shells/script.
THus: Setting it higher *may* improve your latency if you've other CPU
intensive task going. Setting it lower will only be a boon if you have
so many active processes that the kernel spend more than negligible time
scheduling, thus you spend fewer cycles scheduling per sec. I don't know
that *so many* is with a 1 GHz CPU is but it's very likely to be > 10.
The O(1) scheduler in progress will push that even higher.
