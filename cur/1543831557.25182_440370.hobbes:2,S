actually Ubuntu can auto load the mmc_block module if needed. I also
have seen a system that looked at the csd.cmdclass value and then
decided to load mmc_block or not. Can't find it on Ubuntu though. Maybe
this was one of my Fedora Core 5 test boxes. Anyway the mmc_block must
stay separate from the mmc_core, because otherwise we will have trouble
to cleanly support SDIO cards in the future.
