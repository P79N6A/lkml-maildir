This mess has been occurring in the kernel for years. The DRM graphics
drivers are used in both BSD and Linux. It is quite easy to contribute
something to this code via LKML and think you are doing it under the
GPL. Doesn't a patch against the kernel have to be GPL? When these
patches get pulled back into BSD and distributed with it, did BSD get
infected with the GPL? AFAIK this has never been legally sorted out.
