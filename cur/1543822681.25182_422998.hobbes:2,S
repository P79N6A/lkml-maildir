Just so you know,
I'm running dm-crypt on top of raid-5 as well. Kernels ranging from
gentoo's hardened 2.6.11 to 2.6.15.X with gentoo patchset on AMD64. The
raid is running since February 2005 with >1TB and survived a disk
failure with rebuild.
Cipher module was aes, now the asm-accelerated x86_64 version. The
filesystem is ext-3. Survived several hard lockups (damn cheap SATA
controllers hanging if a drive passes out), an LV/filesystem resize, and
feeding with GBytes of data in a row (at max ~30MByte/s to 2-3 files in
parallel).
Just re-checked the filesystem: no metadata information wrong. I
remember I checked the crc of several bigger archives when I had to
replace a drive two month ago, and couldn't find any problems then.
Best regards,
Christian
