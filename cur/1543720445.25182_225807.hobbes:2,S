Coming in way too late, how about changing the other end?  Each
filesystem provides a new function that transforms high resolution
time into whatever the filesystem can store.  If the function is NULL,
we use a sane default like above.
-	inode->i_atime.tv_nsec = inode->i_ctime.tv_nsec = inode->i_mtime.tv_nsec = 0;
If the user never sees the high resolution in the first place, we
don't need to play guessing games later, after data has been flushed
from the page cache.
