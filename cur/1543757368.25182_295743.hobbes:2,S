Why not leave the choice to the BIOS writers? If some are able to
save/restore video state by themselves, we shoudln't stop them.
As long as the state after resume accepts setting the mode without
lockup, we should be fine.

That could even be automated more. A live cd which boots, performs
a few tests, displays the results on screen and offers an option
to save these results to usbstick/network/disk/whatever.
After saving the boot results, it will perform a S3 suspend and
resume and display/save the results of that, too. If Intel have
enough money, they could provide the functionality on a hard
disk and it would have the benefit that S4 could be tested as well.
If the disk has a FAT32 partition, the results can be saved there.
