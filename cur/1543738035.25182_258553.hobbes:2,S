mmap() _is_ in POSIX AFAIK. Also, there are other standards for things
that aren't in POSIX, but these are supersets.

I actually also don't agree with this behaviour of the GNU tools..

Perhaps... I get the idea that I just seem to value a standard operating
system interface more than you do; it would be a loss IMHO if people
were forced to write for Linux instead of being able to write portable
applications.
The POSIX interface shouldn't become something one reads to get an idea
of how things wil _not_ work on Linux.
