If this release is equivalent with -mm's bk-acpi.patch from 2.6.10-rc2-mm1 to
2.6.10-rc2-mm4, notice that this kernels' bk-acpi patches have the bug
described in 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2004/11/16/263
 , so I wouldn't really like to
see this pull done to 2.6.10 until the problem is solved...
If you want, I can try this patch to see if it acts like bk-acpi.patch, but I
guess it does...
Best Regards,
Marcos Marado
