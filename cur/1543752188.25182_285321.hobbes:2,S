"O'Quin's law" states that "every system reflects the structure of the
organization creating it".  (Probably not original, I "discovered"
this about 25 years ago, while doing OS development at IBM.)  Compared
to most other operating systems, GNU/Linux has a much larger
organizational gap between kernel development and the rest of the OS.
Like anything else, this is both a strength and a weakness.

This whole RLIMITS_MEMLOCK situation with PAM is a good example of how
that disconnect causes systemic troubles.  AFAICT, fixing the
longstanding bug in mlock() introduced a Denial of Service bug in
Debian (and perhaps other distributions) when running 2.6.10.
Clearly, this is not a kernel bug.  In fact, the kernel was broken
before.  But, it is an excellent example of how depending on a
Byzantine mechanism like PAM *harms* system security.  The Debian
developers are very careful about things like this.  If they can't get
the default install right, something is badly amiss, damaging
complexity in the overall system.  The kernel is not solely
responsible for that, but ignoring its contribution would be a
mistake.

"Near-RT" is about the most useless concept I've heard of in a long
time.  It sounds like the answer to a question nobody asked.  ;-)
Linux can and should develop a better unprivileged realtime scheduling
algorithm.  But, this is not an "escape hatch" to avoid confronting
mainline 2.6 security problems.  We still have 2005 problems to solve.
