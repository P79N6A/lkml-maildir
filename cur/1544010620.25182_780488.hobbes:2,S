i'm not sure how your example applies: the kernel module loader is not an 
application that needs to be updated to new versions of syscalls. Nor is 
it a needless duplication of infrastructure - it runs in a completely 
different protection domain - just to name one of the key differences.
Applications going to complex raw syscalls and avoiding a neutral hw 
infrastructure library that implements a non-trivial job is quite typical 
for FOSS-library-shy bin-only apps. The "you cannot infringe what you do 
not link to at all" kind of defensive thinking.
