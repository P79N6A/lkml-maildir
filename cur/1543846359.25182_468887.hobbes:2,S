Note that the whole ppc patch here seems broken. Sorry for not jumping
earlier, I've been swamped with other things.
First, why the heck do you use indices 0 and 1 explicitely rather than
the symbolic constants ? ppc doesn't have a ZONE_NORMAL, so we should be
filling ZONE_DMA and ZONE_HIGHMEM but you end up filling ZONE_DMA and
ZONE_NORMAL and leave ZONE_HIGHMEM alone. Also, you leave other entries
filled with crap (the array isn't initialized) which cause some strange
display of the PFN list, if not worse problems later, I don't know for
sure at this stage.
I've about to run some tests with this patch. Looks like we need give a
closer look at those patches, in case that breakage appears on other
archs as well (or similar).
---
New zone initialisation on powerpc is broken, especially with
CONFIG_HIGHMEM, this fixes it by initializing the array to 0 and filling
up the right entries.
