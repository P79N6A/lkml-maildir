Helo, linux guru.
This is a very small and first patch against 2.4.9 kernel.
I think anyone can do this, but forgot.
It was made after looking into binfmt_aaout.c and comparison with
binfmt_elf.c
And while the graetest guru are speaking about great, complex and
particularily needed tasks, small beginers are ( and i suppose lamers( and
i
hope not for a long time)) trying to fix small problems :))
Here it:
