It was with the same client; I did "cp bigfile > /dev/null" to prime
the cache (does that prime the buffer cache?) and then 
"time cp bigfile server".  I'd expect the same number of syscalls
when I do that.

Hey, I'm all for it.  I think it's great.
I have no desire whatsoever to go back to the times where it was faster
for me to ftp a file (including typing my password and cd in the right
directory) then to copy it via NFS (especially for those .no4 files.)
I'll monitor the next release(s) to see what comes out of it.
