Without parameters:
parport0: PC-Style at 0x378 [SPP,PS2]

Actually, I gave the parameters (io=0x378 irq=7 dma=3) by hand because
the parport_pc picked irq 5 even when the compaq setup says that the irq
of the port is 7 (and dma 3; io 378-37F, 778-77A). Now, when I check it
the irq 5 comes from conf.modules. But this doesn't make any difference.
I added some debugging messages into the code and in the function
parport_ECR_present in line
if ((parport_pc_read_econtrol(pb)&0x3)!=0x1)
the parport_pc_read_econtrol returns 0xFF. Doesn't that mean that the
extension registers doesn't show up at all? I wonder if there is some
configuration registers in the chip set where the ECP functionality
should be enabled first (I have checked the setup - there is nothing
more than disable the ECP port control). I have tried to get some info
about the hardware but no luck.
If you have something in your mind for me to try, I'd be very happy to
try it, even if it was modifying the kernel sources.
And, thanks very much for your answer - I couldn't imagine getting
support directly from developers from -- you know where...
