No, it is _not_ correct! As I understand this algo was borrowed from
ip_forward.c without thinking. It must be simply ums->maddr=rt->rt_src
in this case. Even more, as I see, the code loses maddr passed by caller
somewhere and it is just crime...

It was bug. People expected the first address and I expected it too,
only did this silly mistake. 8)8)
