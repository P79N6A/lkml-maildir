Dear Kernel Developers,
I have noticed the schedule_timeout behaving somewhat different as penned from the Linux 2.6 Oreelly books.
I have developed a SD card Driver for 2.6.10 kernel & it works fine.
I needed a hardware reg to update that take a time of 300ms. I have issued a call like..
set_current_state(TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE);
schedule_timeout (300*HZ/1000);
I guess schedule_timeout should calls the scheduler after ensuring that the current process is awakened at timeout
expiration.
But, when I finally use it I get a sufficient delay which looks like a looped delay not allowing the keyboard to print messages on the screen.
I verified it ...
1) with debug messages immediately before & after the schedule_timeout call.
2) Commenting the schedule_timeout call.
Can someone comment on the schedule_timeout please?
Regards,
Mukund Jampala

Subject: RE: Which version of 2.6.11 is most stable
Dear Adrian,
Thanks for the information.
Also Can you please give inputs regarding.....
I have an existing Linux 2.6.11 BSP for an AMD GX processor.
What would it take me to port the complete BSP to 2.6.12 kernel?
Can I prefer to work on 2.6.11 kernel which makes me get the system up in no time without any changes made?
I guess 2.6.11 kernel will work with just a recompilation over 2.6.11.12 kernel.
An inquisitive question about Linux kernels versioning ...
How do 2.6.(x).1 and 2.6.(x).12 kernels vary?
Regards,
Mukund Jampala

The latest, IOW 2.6.11.12 .
But note that the 2.6.11 branch is no longer maintained since kernel 
2.6.12 was released 5 months ago, and therefore lacks e.g. current 
security fixes.
