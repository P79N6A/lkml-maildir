Sorry for the noise, its not a kernel problem. Switching back to 2.6.11 didn't 
help, so we investigated further. It turned out, that one of our clients was 
in a kind of a zombie state and asking for filehandles, but not answering 
request from the server. Since unfs3 is only single threaded, all other 
clients had to wait for timeouts.
