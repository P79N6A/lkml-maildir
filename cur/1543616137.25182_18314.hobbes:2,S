Unfortunately, no, that's not how they (the black-list maintainers) operate.  
Speaking from experience, you get an email informing you that you're already 
on the blacklist.  Note, also, that being on the blacklist doesn't imply that 
you're actually sending span or are being used to send spam, either.  You can 
get black listed for allowing "open relaying", meaning that your sendmail 
will relay from outside to outside, basically.  The impotus is on you, the 
administrator, to resolve the problem *and* prove to them that it's been 
solved.  Mind you, this was several years ago, but I doubt that it's changed 
significantly.
It sure would be nice if they'd send you an email informing you that your 
site has an open relay, and if it's not corrected within, say, 1 week, you'll 
be put on the black list.  These sites also obviously have tests for checking 
for open relays, also.  The administrator of said site should be allowed 
access to these same tests to aid in diagnosing and solving the problem.
Sorry about the rant.  I appreciate what the black-listers are trying to do, 
but I think that their method sucks.
