Nope.  The Known Files List is an in-core data structure only.  You want
an image to be known, you execute INSTALL on it every time you boot.

No spoofing, either.  The kernel holds an open file handle on each known
file all the time it is "known".  The file *cannot* be replaced unless you
deINSTALL it.  And the file's KFL entry is the only thing consulted when
checking for amplified privileges, so privs evaporate when you deINSTALL.

This is that heavy-duty audit stuff discussed in another recent thread.
You need a certain privilege to make KFEs, and the system can be set to
audit every use of that privilege.

I presume that the KFL is hashed or something.  The lookup is so fast I
couldn't say how long it takes.  The KFL only has about a hundred entries,
on systems I've examined.  Besides, INSTALLed images start *faster*
because the file header (including a chunk of retrieval pointers) stays in
core forever -- the usage count never drops to zero, y'know.  Some people
INSTALL a few images with no privs, just to get 'em to start faster.
