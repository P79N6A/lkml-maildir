We will see how it develops. Actually the marker could be used to detect
endianness of the file if I read below URL correctly ....

No need to. Other people tried already.

No, the saying was more: "don't support XHTML since it may break HTML
compliant browsers."
For XHTML/HTML we all know that this is not the case, so the comparison
is flawed.

In that case, any U+FEFF occurring in the middle of the file can be
ignored, or treated as an error.

Well, this doesn't sound like an clear rule stating that it *must* be
ignored.

Q: How I should deal with BOMs?

3. Some byte oriented protocols expect ASCII characters at the beginning
of a file. If UTF-8 is used with these protocols, use of the BOM as
encoding form signature should be avoided.

Voila. Avoid the BOM in your scripts and be done.

Yes, now since multi-byte character sets gets more commonly used.
However, I don't think you get this into the C standard. But we are now
far off the discussion ....

I belive this vor vim, emacs, etc. but I don't believe ir for the native
ones ...
