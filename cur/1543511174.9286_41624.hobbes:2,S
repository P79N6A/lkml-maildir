No, these inodes are not necessarily unused.  The page cache does not
count as a user on the inode's i_count field, but it does count against
the i_nrpages field.  That's why the CAN_UNUSE macro reads as
#define CAN_UNUSE(inode) \
	(((inode)->i_count | (inode)->i_state | (inode)->i_nrpages) == 0)
An inode with zero i_count may also be dirty, and hence still contain
important state.
