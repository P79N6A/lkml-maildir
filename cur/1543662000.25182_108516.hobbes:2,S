Linus, do you remember what "nasty deadlock" did you mean when writing
this to 2.[0-2].* and maybe 1.*?
ll_rw_blk.c - ll_rw_block():
        /* Uhhuh.. Nasty dead-lock possible here.. */
        if (buffer_locked(bh))
                return;
        /* Maybe the above fixes it, and maybe it doesn't boot. Life is
interesting */
        lock_buffer(bh);
