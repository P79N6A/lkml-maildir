I got the same problem for an old 486 with no PCI, as yenta_socket doesn't work, i
have to add CONFIG_I82365
in order to have things work. 'till this is set and recompiled, everything works
perfectly. The controller is a
VLSI 82C146.
I'm problably missing something, but these's two things i don't understand:
-why PCMCIA depends on PCI at compilation time
-why yenta is activated for i82365, as it doesn't do the job i82365 did.
