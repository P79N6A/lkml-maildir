Hello.
Thanks for reformatting my patch
and sorry for surprising you with directory name
(I meant to type linux-2.6.24-rc2, not linux-2.6.22-rc2).
According to linux-2.6.23,
it seems that I should return -ENOTDIR
for invalid args->nlen value.
I got a question here regarding interpretation of CTL_MAXNAME .
Is args->nlen == CTL_MAXNAME valid?
It is treated as invalid while the definition says
  /* how many path components do we allow in a
     call to sysctl?   In other words, what is
     the largest acceptable value for the nlen
     member of a struct __sysctl_args to have? */
If "name[CTL_MAXNAME];" is what the author intended,
I think args->nlen == CTL_MAXNAME is valid.
Regards.
