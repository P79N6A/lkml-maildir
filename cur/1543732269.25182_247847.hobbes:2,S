Per-command parameters included?
People really do want private syscalls. An ioctl
is that, in a namespace defined by the file
descriptor. So ioctl() provides local scope to
something that would otherwise be global.
The alternative is to add a zillion odd syscalls.
Life is messy.

That's just a double-crufty ioctl in disguise.

It looks like encouragement of choices that will
tend toward the creation of buffer overflows in
the kernel. Nearly all buffer overflows involve
parsing ASCII. Sure, nobody should make mistakes...
People won't do that though. Know what you'll
get if ioctl isn't used? Here you go:
///////////////////////  Look ma, no ioctl!  /////
struct ctldata scd;
struct ctldata *scdp = &scd;
scd.command = GET_MOTOR_TEMPERATURE;
scd.arg[0] = MOTOR_Z;
// Arjan wants it this way.
// (for Viro, must print the pointer in decimal)
write(fd, &scdp, sizeof ctldata);
motor_temp.current = scd.ret[0];
motor_temp.peak    = scd.ret[1];
