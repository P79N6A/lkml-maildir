the reference to zyxel (from Jeff G ?) :
>ZyXEL P681 -> firmware v2.50(T.05)b6 | 03/28/2001)
btw: it is already offically release version 2.50(T.05)| 04/13/2001
     and the ECN issue is fixed.
I have asked if the developers would ake actoin on the other
routers/firewalls as well to fix the ECN trouble.
