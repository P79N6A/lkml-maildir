Hi all.
Is there some new package for afpfs that work in 2.2.x? I have netatalk
working on, but i want to copy files from/to mac´s using my linux. I can
do the reverse, copy files to/from my linux on macs. Trying to compile
afpfs (any known version) in 2.2 get me a lot of warinigs and errors, so
i compiled against 2.0.36 (doing little modifications in time.h, i
think, to allow compiling with egcs), but the module afpfs can´t be
loaded in 2.2.6, and the tools need this module.
Any hint or mistake i´m doing? Thanks.
