Well, on a raw disk, O_DIRECT is fine too, but yeah, you might as well 
use SG_IO at that point. All of my issues are all about filesystems.
And filesystems is where people use O_DIRECT most. Almost nobody puts 
their database on a partition of its own these days, afaik. Perhaps for 
benchmarking or some really high-end stuff. Not "normal users".
