Tim,
I do not know where you have been hiding, but you get it!
NanoSecond timers to determine command respond for storage statics goes
far beyond the latency issues (imho are bogus).  Bogus meaning there are
no known (to me) means to profile kernel performance based on usage.
Desktop, Workstation, Appliance are not equal in needs.
Back to the "NanoSecond timers" one can also generate drive predictive
failure rates.  Determinations based on slip or oob sector access from an
unrecorded sector reallocation event.
At least someone out there is thinking and appears to own one of the few
and rare "Andre to Human" translators.
Cheers,
Andre Hedrick
