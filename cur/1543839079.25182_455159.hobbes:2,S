Probably more on-topic:
We have law people in .at who think/propose/have the opinion that one
entity as seen by the user/consumer has one license. So if you pack a
GPL program on it, the whole entity is GPL.
Given the current common method of providing one firmware image per
device for download to upgrade/bugfix, the producer of that image must
adhere to the GPL for *all+ of the source code of that image (+
necessary toolchain etc.).
The reasoning is: The user/consumer sees one thing and that's it.
If such an interpretation is "good" or "bad" (and for whom) is another
question.
The counter strategies to work around that are probably obvious.
