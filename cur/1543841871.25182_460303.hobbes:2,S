Subject: [PATCH]: Fix locking for tty drivers when doing urgent characters
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/9/4/152

If you send a priority character (as is done for flow control) then the
tty driver can either have its own method for "jumping the queue" or the
characrer can be queued normally. In the latter case we call the write
method but without the atomic_write_lock taken elsewhere.
Make this consistent. Note that the send_xchar method if implemented
remains outside of the lock as it can jump ahead of a current write so
must not be locked out by it.
