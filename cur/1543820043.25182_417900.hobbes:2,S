There are six of those in the file: the first one works and the rest fail.
This causes 5 * 16 bytes of fill to be missing from the output file.
Trying to get an assembler listing makes the problem go away:
$ as -o mutex.bad.o mutex.s
mutex.s: Assembler messages:

$ as -al -o mutex.good.o mutex.s >mutex.lst
$ ll mutex*.o
