Subject: [PATCH 9/11] Panic delay fix
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Failure to use real-time delay here causes the keyboard to become demonically
possessed in the event of a kernel crash, with wildly blinking lights and
unpredictable behavior.  This has resulted in several injuries.
