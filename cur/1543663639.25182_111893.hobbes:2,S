Oh, ok. We did that for alpha, and it was a good deal there (it's actually
architected for alpha). So yes, I don't mind doing it for the page tables,
and it should work fine on x86 too (it's not necessarily a very portable
approach, since it requires that the pmd- and the pte- tables look the
same, which is not always true).
So sure, go ahead with that part.
