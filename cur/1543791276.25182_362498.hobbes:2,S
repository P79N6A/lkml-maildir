It's a simple program I put together to test wakeup latency. Each
thread basically sleeps for 20ms, wakes up and executes a couple of
instructions and goes back to sleep for another 20ms. Multiply this by
a thousand. What I found out is that, inthis situation, and using
realtime-preempt, SCHED_OTHER offers 3 orders of magnitude less
latency than SCHED_FIFO or SCHED_RR. Which suggests to me there is
something fishy going on.
