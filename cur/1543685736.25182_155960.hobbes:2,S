Why would the cryptoapi version be faster, I wondered?  So I had a look.
No conclusions, just observations.
  - random.c defines a constant, SHA_CODE_SIZE.  This selects between
    4 implementations, from smaller to (presumably) faster by
    progressively unrolling more and more.
    This is set to SHA_CODE_SIZE == 0, for smallest code.
    In crypto/sha1.c, the code is roughly equivalent to SHA_CODE_SIZE == 3,
    random.c's _largest_ implementation.
    So you seem to be replacing a small version with a large version,
    albeit faster.
  - One of the optimisations in crypto/sha1.c is:
      /* blk0() and blk() perform the initial expand. */
      /* I got the idea of expanding during the round function from SSLeay */
    Yet, random.c has the opposite:
      /*
       * Do the preliminary expansion of 16 to 80 words.  Doing it
       * out-of-line line this is faster than doing it in-line on
       * register-starved machines like the x86, and not really any
       * slower on real processors.
       */
    I wonder if the random.c method is faster on x86?
  - sha1_transform() in crypto/sha1.c ends with this misleading
    comment.  Was the author trying to prevent data leakage?  If so,
    he failed:
	/* Wipe variables */
	a = b = c = d = e = 0;
	memset (block32, 0x00, sizeof block32);
    The second line will definitely be optimised away.  The third
    could be, although GCC doesn't.
Enjoy,
