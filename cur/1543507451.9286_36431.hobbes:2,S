From the 597 (vp3) documentation:
Device 0 Offset 70 - PCI buffer control - RW
------------------------------------------------------------
Bit 7 - CPU to PCI Post-Write - 0 disable(default), 1 enable
I checked the documentation, and Device 0 Offset 70 bit 7 seems to be
exactly the same function for 595 (vp2/97), 598 (mvp3), and 691 (apollopro).
