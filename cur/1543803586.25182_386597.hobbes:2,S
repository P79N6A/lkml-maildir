Hello list,
I've recently gotten an Dell D610 laptop from my company. After some digging I 
managed to get Linux running on it, with kernel 2.6.15 at this moment.
There is something odd going on with the LID switch functionality tho: 
everytime the LID is closed, the screen goes off, as expected. Unfortunately, 
the screen does not come back alive afterwards, it remains blank.
Starting X doesn't help, switching consoles doesn't help either. The problem 
is appareant both in X and the console.
The laptop remains completely functional, except for the display.
Currently I'm not using a fb console, and the X driver is the i810.
Any ideas?
Thanks,
Jan
