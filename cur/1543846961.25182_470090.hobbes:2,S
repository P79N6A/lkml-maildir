When I was hacking on my old noidletick patch I ran into this
problem on several machines too.
But usually the problem wasn't that it was too slow, but that
it completely stopped in C2 or deeper. I don't think there
is a way to work around that except for not using C2 or deeper
(not an option) or using a different timer source.
If that is true then hitting space lots of time will make it 
go faster.
