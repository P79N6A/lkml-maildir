I had a failure building NVIDIA_kernel/nv.c (the nvidia driver):
http://download.nvidia.com/XFree86_40/1.0-4191/NVIDIA_kernel-1.0-4191.tar.gz
It uses
	pte = *pte_offset(pg_mid_dir, address);
but this patch removes pte_offset().
1) what is the correct fix (use pte_offset_kernel?)?
2) in general, is it wise to remove pte_offset() or should it
   be left for compatability?
I should clearly say that I am not familiar with the workings of this
patch, but find that it is likely to break drivers that are not in
the kernel tree (assuming you patch them).
