Taking a look at that, I found one case that _might_ explain it.  That
scenario could crop more (or less) based on loads and timings, and I've
suspected that the VIA chips have significantly different timings for
certain things.  This patch handles that case differently, just expecting
the unlink completion code (later) to restart the schedule.
I sanity tested this, but that's all.
