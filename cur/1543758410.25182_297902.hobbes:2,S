What overhead does the netlink_send() impose if there are no listeners? 
Sure, it wont go anywhere, but the message will have to be assembled and sent 
anyway. Correct? 
The way things are now, its necessary to make the decision to invoke or not 
netlink_send() due to the supposed overhead. 
Thats what Guillaume is doing, and thats what will have to be done whenever
one wants to send information through netlink from performance critical paths.
Can't the assembly/etc overhead associated with netlink_send() be avoided
earlier, approaching zero-cost ? 
Being able to get rid of the decision to invoke or not the sendmsg would be nice.
