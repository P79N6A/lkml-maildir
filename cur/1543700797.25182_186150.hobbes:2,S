Hi,
I am getting kernel panic, when i try to upgrade my
kernel from 2.4.20-6 to 2.4.22.
This is on a Compaq desktop, and the 2.4.20-6 is what
i got as kernel from Redhat 9.0 CDs. I use GRUB
loader, and there is no other OS in the system.
Following are the steps i took, based on the
/usr/src/linux-2.4.20-6/README file.
Downloaded the linux-2.4.22.tar.gz file into /usr/src,
and untarred, which created /usr/src/linux-2.4.22.
# cd /usr/src/linux-2.4.22
# make config
# make dep
# make bzImage
# make modules
# make modules_install
# make install
No error came in any of these steps, and i could see
additional entries added for GRUB, and the boot image
appropriately copied into /boot
After these, when i reboot, i could see the additional
entry for 2.4.22 shown in GRUB menu. When i select
that and enter, following are some of the final
messages i get, saying kernel panic.
ds: no socket drivers loaded!
VFS: Cannot open root device "LABEL=/" or 00:00
Please append a correct "root=" boot option
Kernel panic: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on 00:00
Not sure if i am missing some step, or missing to read
some already written document.
Your help will be appreciated.
Thanks,
Elwin.
