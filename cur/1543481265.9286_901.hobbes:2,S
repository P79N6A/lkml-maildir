I would then make it clearer _and_ insert something about its speediness.  Right now,
it (meaning "SAMBA enables NT sharing from Linux") seems unclear (e.g., which is the
server?  Are the Linux boxen the clients, or is the Linux box acting as the
NT server?  I don't think most people, even NT admins, know that Windows
NT filesharing/printsharing = "SMB," and PHB's definitely won't know) and doesn't
really tout the speediness you are referring to.
