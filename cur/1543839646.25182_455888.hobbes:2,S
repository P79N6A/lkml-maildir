If I was interested in statistics, I could also use [1] that shows 
statistics about running kernels automatically submitted my nearly ten 
times as many machines than in KLive.
2.6.16.27 is the latest 2.6.16 kernel, available for more than one month.
KLive says no KLive user is using 2.6.16.27.
[1] says 0.2% of the machines reporting there are using 2.6.16.27.
If I was believing in such statistics, there was no 2.6.16 branch.
The important feedback are emails from people reporting a bug or saying 
"thank you".
This branch is an offer.
If it runs on millions of computers that's OK.
If it's used only by few people that's OK.
