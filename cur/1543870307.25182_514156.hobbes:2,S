Yep? Feel free to rewrite networking to assembly on Eugenix. That
should get you 1% improvement. If you reserve few registers to be only
used by kernel (not allowed by userspace), you can speedup networking
5%, too. Ouch and you could turn off MMU, that is sure way to get few
more percent improvement in your networking case.

Stop trying to pervert my logic.

Actually, yes, that's a concern. If your code is so crappy that we
can't understand it, guess what, it is not going to be merged. Notice
that someone will have to maintain your code if you get hit by bus.
If your code is so complex that it is almost impossible to use from
userspace, that is good enough reason not to be merged. "But it is 3%
faster if..." is not a good-enough argument.

I think Ingo demonstrated unoptimized threadlets to be within 5% to
the speed of kevent. Demonstrate that kevents are twice faster than
syslets on reasonable test case, and I guess we'll listen...
