Yes, because now some kernel code is going to wait 147 days - 1s
or something like that to finish.
See Tim Schmielau <tim@physik3.uni-rostock.de> patch for testing jiffies
wrap.  It _initializes_ jiffies to a high pre-wrap value, maybe 5
minutes before wrap, instead of playing around with the jiffies value
after the system is running.
