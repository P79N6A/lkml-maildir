That's what fdisk showed me. I don't have a true UTF-8 system, so when
cutting-and-pasing between the shell and mail app, it might have been
distorted. But the output WAS weird!

So how come it got corrupt? I did a 'dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdb' (and
waited for the whole disk to be zeroed - took HOURS! :). Then partitioned
the disk and cut-and-pasted the output into the mail...
EVERY time I check the partition table (using mac-fdisk and not cfdisk),
that destorted output is shown. It's not distorted/corrupt if I use
cfdisk though...
Since I don't exactly know how to do all this with the tools in Linux,
I took the disk to my girlfriends WinXP and is currently using
'OnTrack EasyRecorvery Professional - ERP' to do scanns and tests of
the disk.
I tried parition and format it there to, but the format failed (no reason
why). I'm currently running the extended S.M.A.R.T. test. And there where
other tests I could do to... I'll let you know.
One weird thing though... ERP only found it as a 137Mb disk! It's supposed
to be a 400Gb...
