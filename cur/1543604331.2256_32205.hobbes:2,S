#include <hallo.h>
I have a system with 3GB RAM and no Swap at all.
Before the test "free" showed about 2GB for "cached" and about 800MB was
free. ("Fresh"-System after boot up. Only copied some files before)
Then i wanted to copy about 1.5GB to a "tmpfs" mount.
After about 800MB the copying stopped. On another console, where i wanted
to run "free" again, i just got a "out of memory"-type of warning.
(No errors showed up in syslog)
I had to abort the copy and umount the tmpfs-partition.
With 2.4.9 this scenario works without problems.
If any more informations is needed, i will provide them.
Bis denn

wants a "you asked for it, you got it" text editor -- complicated, 
cryptic, powerful, unforgiving, dangerous.
