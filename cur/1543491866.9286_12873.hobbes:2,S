Hi,
 I'm still not getting connection with my PC-Bit card with >=2.2.4
versions !
 There are many people like me !
 Could someone help on how to debug this !?
 I'm trying to know on which file is this problem ....
 What I'm doing is untar kernel 2.2.3 then patch 2.2.4 ; after that
check which files were changed, copy them from 2.2.3 I compile them!
 I already had copied all files on drivers/ directory and it still
didn't worked ... so maybe the problem it's not on that directory.
 When I try do copy all the files from net/ or ipv4/ directory (from
2.2.3) to the 2.2.4 on compiling I get some errors.
 Is there any better solution to debug this ?
 I really need help. If I can't debug this I'll need to work forever
with 2.2.3. kernel ! :(
 As my isdn card (PC-Bit) is manufactured in Portugal, probably, there
will be very few people asking for help ...
 Thanks.
 Regards,
    Nuno Carvalho
