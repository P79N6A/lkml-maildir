Subject: [2.4.1] mkreiserfs on loopdevice freezes kernel

Hello,
if I run mkreiserfs on a 32megablocks /dev/loop0 it will lock up while
generating the journaling information. Sometimes at 20% sometimes at 60%.
Since mkreiserfs is not using the kernel module i guess this is a loop
device problem in 2.4.1 kernels.
There is no dmesg message at the lookup. mkreiserfs is in state 'D'. The
system issomewhat useable (X) but some programs just lock in syscalls (no su
or login possible).
If I run losetup -d /dev/loop0 on that device i will get a message that it
is busy, but the program will not return enymore. It is in 'D' also.
This is an unecncrypted loop device on a ext2 filesystem on a AIC-7861. Loop
is autoloaded as a module.
Wanted to try reiserfs with some verbose debugging for some time. Well,
perhaps md is my friend...
Greetings
Bernd
