I know of one issue that remains, which seems to have hit a few Gentoo users.
See
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0502.0/0219.html
and
http://bugs.gentoo.org/90069
It's been reported to this mailing list, but I've also asked the affected
Gentoo users to file a bug at the kernel bugzilla.
