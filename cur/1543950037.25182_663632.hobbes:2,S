Unfortunatelly, I have not tried the new version of slot detection
driver because of the lack of test environment. Maybe we need more
several days to wait for test environment. 
BTW, does the new one fixes the issue I reported before? I could not
find it in the changelog. IIRC, this issue was difficult to solve
because the root cause of this issue is from the difference of
interpretation of ACPI spec between HP and Fujitsu (I still don't
think it's a good idea to evaluate _SUN for the device object whose
_STA is 0).
Anyway, Fujitsu servers which suffer from this issue doesn't need
the slot detection driver because its PCI slots are all hot-pluggable
and it already has /sys/bus/pci/slots/XXXX directory for all PCI
slots. So one of the workaround is to not use slot detection driver.
But when I tried it before, it was automatically loaded at boot up
time and then I got strange slot named '1023' and many warning
messages (stack traces).
Thanks,
Kenji Kaneshige
