OK, cool.  We can have that debate later.

Two suggestions:
1) I think you only want the fastpath when it's eliminated by the
compiler, so perhaps:
	if (__builtin_constant_p(nbits) && nbits <= BITS_PER_LONG)
2) The normal kernel naming scheme is two underscores (__bitmap_and),
probably because it's clearer visually.
Thanks,
Rusty.
