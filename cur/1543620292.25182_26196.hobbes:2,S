My investigations show an infinite loop commences on the
adapter driver's queue_command() when a MEDIUM_ERROR is
reported. I have added an option to scsi_debug to simulate
a MEDIUM ERROR at a fixed address (0x1234). If I use sg
to read the scsi_debug ram disk it is well behaved,
stopping in an orderly fashion in sg_dd at the bad block.
However if that bad block is read via sd then the scsi_debug
driver's queue_command() entry point is called indefinitely
trying to reread the range that contains the bad block.
A new scsi_debug driver, version 1.58 has been placed
on 
http://www.torque.net/sg/sdebug.html
Load the scsi_debug module with "scsi_debug_opts=3" to
get debug output and the medium_error at block 0x1234 .
So the problem has been reported on these adapter
drivers: aic7xxx, sym53c8xx and scsi_debug . It is
interesting that sg doesn't have problems, probably
because it sets "retries" to 1 (i.e. don't retry).
Looks like the error handling logic is broken.
