I'm currently writing a kernel driver dealing with memory interaction
and I'm having an issue with memory protection. I'm trying to figure
out how I can determine the protection set on a page of memory. For
example, with the mprotect syscall I can specify a set of protection
flags in order to change whether a memory page is readable, writable,
and executable or not. I don't want to change the protection. I'd
really just like to query it and figure out what the current
protection is set to for a particular page of memory.
I'd basically be looking for something similar to VirtualQuery from
WinAPI which I believe could give me that sort of information. I'm
just having trouble finding something like that here in Linux. Is
there some system call that I have overlooked?
