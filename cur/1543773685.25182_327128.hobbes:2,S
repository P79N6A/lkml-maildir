Congratulations, you proved that a register push is faster than a 3 byte
memory push.  I believe this is exactly what I said would happen if the
autovar pointer wound up being enregistered.
However, it is NOT what GCC will generate for pushing params to static
strings.
For that you're going to get a 5 byte PUSH imm32.
