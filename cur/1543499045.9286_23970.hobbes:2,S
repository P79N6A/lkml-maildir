I have all the source trees from 2.2.1 to the newest (via patches starting
at 2.2.2).  This does sorta pertain to the above about backups (I hear
people saying it's a waste of space <g>.  It's not too much, just the size
of 2 full kernels)
I unpack the tarball, mv it to the version number, and
cp -lax <version> linux
then patch that.
This is where I get confused sometimes... I'd rather just do this:
cp -lax 2.2.9 2.2.10
cd 2.2.10
zcat ../patch-2.2.10.gz|patch -p2
I get through most files ok, but some don't patch right and it doesn't make
sense.  Anyone shed some light on that?
BTW, if the patch goes bad, rm -rf 2.2.10 (or whatever) and start over
again....  It breaks hard links to files that change which I like =)
(Please, lets not talk about the links.  I realize how thats done =)
