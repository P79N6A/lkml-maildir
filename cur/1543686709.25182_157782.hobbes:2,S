It doesn't cause a compile error in 2.4.
This is inside an __exit function and in 2.4 __exit functions are 
discarded at link time when compiling a driver statically.
Due to changes Andi Kleen did in 2.6 __exit functions are no longer
discarded at link time when compiling a driver statically (they are
discarded at runtime).
