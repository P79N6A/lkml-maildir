I tried the workarounds with a 2.6.15 kernel. They
didn't work for me.
I installed Debian's 2.6.16-1-k7 kernel (from sid).
The 3D acceleration WORKS now but I'm only getting
about HALF the frame rate (ppracer) as I did with
Debian's 2.6.8-3-k7 kernel (with xfree86).
Both test were with a Matrox g400.
Could the frame rate change just be a difference
between xfree86 and xorg?
