Hi Martin,
Hi Jens,
Hi LKML,

unlikely() shows the reader immediately that this is (considered)
a "rare" condition. This might stop janitors optimizing these
cases at all or let people with deeper knowledge check, whether
this is REALLY rare. 
likely() should lead to the analogous actions.
So this is not only a hint for the compiler and I'm very happy to
see this being used and can stand the code clutter caused by
this ;-)
OTOH your point about inline is very valid. I use it only for
code splitting or trivial functions with decisions on compile
time constants. Everything else just bloats the *.o files.
Regards
Ingo Oeser
