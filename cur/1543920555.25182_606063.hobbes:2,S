No.  It is worse you need to access a filesystem and probably
a block device that is available on both machine A and machine B.
With care we can introduce appropriate namespaces and namespace semantics
so we can make the names be what we need.
For a classic tricky case think what it would require to migrate
a git archive with checked out files and not need to say
"git-update-index --refresh" before you work with the files.
I used names like disk-1 and disk-2 instead of UUIDs because it
was easier for me to type and think about.  You do need some
kind of absolute disk or filesystem identity you can refer back to.
