I just took a look in drivers/net/
and 
	acenic.c
	atarilance.c
	b44.c
	cs89x0.c
	net_init.c
	typhoon.c
all use that netif_running() check when setting the MAC.  I actually just pulled
the function from net_init.c for the tun change.  Are these broken?
(I'm asking in total ignorance so be gentle :).
