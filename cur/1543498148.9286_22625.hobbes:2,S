Subject: Bug in Matrox Framebuffer?

I caused a reproducible hard lockup today. I was ripping an mp3, with
8hz-mp3, which outputs status continually to the screen. I then scrolled
up, but because of the output, I couldn't actually scroll up, so I held
down shift-pageup, which caused the lock. The reason I suspect the matrox
framebuffer code is because when I recompiled the kernel to use just the
standard VGA console, the behavior went away. Magic SysReq does nothing
when it is locked. This is kernel 2.2.9:

I'd be happy to do any debugging people want me to do. As I said, I can
reproduce this at will.
