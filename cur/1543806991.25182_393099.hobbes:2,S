Because libscg handles only SCSI, whereas HAL does work for all disk
types, floppies, serial ports, PCI buses, graphics cards, processors,
etc. Imagine there was one library per peripheral type - oh the pain.

For now, it sure doesn't equal cdrecord in that area. But give it time
and it will progress. After all, there's no reason HAL can't gain from
your expertise on the matter.

FreeBSD's failure is a good indication it's true.
