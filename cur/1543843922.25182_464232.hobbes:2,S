As I said, the problem is _occasionally_ theoretical.
This would happen f.e. if packet socket handler was installed
after IP handler. Then tcpdump would get packet after it is processed
(acked/replied/forwarded). This would be disasterous, the results
are unparsable.
I recall, the issue was discussed, and that time it looked more
reasonable to solve problems of this kind taking timestamp once
before it is seen by all the rest of stack. Who could expect that
PIT nightmare is going to return? :-)

I see. Thank you.
