Well, its not quite like that, the irq mess in apm does an explicit
unbalanced irq action, and lockdep rightly triggers on that.
And adding to that comes the fact that we do indeed call a BIOS routine
which can do god knows what.
So we want to save irq state and force it into a known state; normally
it will only be disable - however in this case (when
apm_info.allow_ints) we force enable it. All end scope routines expect
irqs disabled.
logically it looks something like this
local_irq_save(flags)
local_irq_enable()
...
local_irq_disable() <--- missing
local_irq_restore(flags)
except that the first two statements are blended together to avoid the
unneeded disable.
The logic is sound because local_irq_restore will just set whatever was
saved, except lockdep gets confused by the unbalanced operations - a
good thing IMHO.
