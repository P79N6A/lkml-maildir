Yes, they are not pretty. I would suggest puting them in
order, but nothing else. As you can tell by the response,
you have tripped on a hornet's nest and they are attacking
anything in the area. I certainly would not remove 'L' from
any of those constants. The code will be exactly the same
when compiled, but there may be some diagnostic messages
and nasty-grams from kernel hackers.
Cheers,
