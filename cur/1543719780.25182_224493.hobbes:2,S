Keyboards are to be handled in-kernel, at least for now. If there really
a need we can enable grabbing keyboard as well, no big deal.

Vojtech has a patch for that - now raw (really raw) codes are reported via
EV_MSC/MSC_RAW event.

We do have some hardcoding so atkbd does not try to grab a serio linked
to a serial port and sermouse does not try grabbing keyboard port, etc..
There is nothing new.

Yes, that's the perfect solution, but I believe we need sysfs for that
and at least I started working on it, but it takes time. In the meantime
i8042.raw should alleviate most of the user's troubles with their input
devices no longer working.
