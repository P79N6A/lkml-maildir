Mainly the v4 patch, but an it-works test on 2.6.22-rc3 just for 
sanity's sake would be useful as well.
If you have time, check both new and old drives with SMART
	smartctl -d ata -t long /dev/blahblah
to make sure the extended tests don't find anything wrong.  Extended 
tests usually take 30-90 minutes.  You can access the hard drive while 
the extended test is running, but I/O will be slower for obvious reasons.
