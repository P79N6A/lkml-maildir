OK, I gave it a test and it appears that the cache hit case is
slightly worse than unconditionnal key loading. So it means that
testing that hte key is cached is as long as loading the key into the
controller. Here is what I did in set_key() function:
static void set_key(const char *key)
{
	static u32 my_key[4] __cacheline_aligned;
	u32 key0 = *(const u32 *)(key + 12);
	u32 key1 = *(const u32 *)(key + 8);
	u32 key2 = *(const u32 *)(key + 4);
	u32 key3 = *(const u32 *)(key);
	int timeout = 100;
	u32 miss = 0;
	miss |= key0 ^ my_key[0];
	miss |= key1 ^ my_key[1];
	miss |= key2 ^ my_key[2];
	miss |= key3 ^ my_key[3];
	if (miss == 0)
		return;
	my_key[0] = key0;
	my_key[1] = key1;
	my_key[2] = key2;
	my_key[3] = key3;
	
	aes_write(be32_to_cpu(key0), AES_KEY0);
	aes_write(be32_to_cpu(key1), AES_KEY1);
	aes_write(be32_to_cpu(key2), AES_KEY2);
	aes_write(be32_to_cpu(key3), AES_KEY3);
	/* generate dkey: should take 11 cycles */
	aes_write(aes_read(AES_CR) | CR_DKEYGEN, AES_CR);
	while (aes_read(AES_CR) & CR_DKEYGEN) {
		if (--timeout == 0)
			break;
	}
}
So I was wrong, hardware access is not so expensive as I thought. But
it also means that all instructions executed in the drivers'
encrypt()/decrypt() methods have a real cost and skipping key loadings
is a win.
Using the driver exclusively doesn't seem to be the right solution,
but I don't see another way to do that...
