Yeah.  I've had a couple of reports of that, and it doesn't seem to be an SMP 
related problem.  I probably need to find time to sit down with the 82586 
databook and check that area of the driver against it -- I had a look at the 
code and nothing seemed to be obviously wrong.
I'm glad to hear that things are working a little better for you, anyway.  
Yes, the patch was against 2.2.7 but the driver hasn't changed in a very long 
time.
