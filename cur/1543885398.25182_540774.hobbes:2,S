You'd still get the BUG message. To fully resolve the problem, we need
to make the hci_sock_dev_event() notifier callout blocking (which
happened with this patch) but also convert hci_sk_list.lock to a
rwsem, but some users of that rwlock (other than hci_sock_dev_event)
are atomic.
However, please do try and get back, as your testing would still be
helpful to see whether converting hci_notifier to blocking had other
side-effects -- if you only see the same message again and otherwise
things seem fine, then we're good as far as at least this change was
concerned.
Thanks,
Satyam
