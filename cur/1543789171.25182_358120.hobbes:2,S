Thank you very much.  I'll reinstate the comment and  
submit this corrected patch
Signed-off-by: suzannew@cs.pdx.edu
ChangeLog:
Because bpq_new_device() calls list_add_rcu()
and bpq_free_device() calls list_del_rcu(),
substitute list_for_each_entry_rcu() for 
list_for_each_entry() in bpq_get_ax25_dev().
This requires the insertion of rcu_read_lock()/unlock().
A consequence of list_for_each_entry_rcu(bpq, &bpq_devices, bpq_list)
is that the future dereference of the pointer to the bpqdev 
struct bpq is rcu-protected.  But bpq_get_ax25_dev() 
returns bpq->axdev, a pointer to a net_device struct.  The 
rcu_read_lock() in bpq_rcv() likely implies that is another 
pointer to receive rcu-protected dereference.
The rcu_read_lock()/unlock() in bpq_device_event() 
are removed due to the following found by considering 
the cases of the switch statement: 
(1) bpq_new_device() calls list_add_rcu() labeled as 
"list protected by RTNL."  
(2) dev_close() as defined in net/core/dev.c 
employs a memory barrier.
(3) bpq_free_device() calls list_del_rcu() which, according 
to list.h, requires synchronize_rcu() which can block or 
call_rcu() or call_rcu_bh() which cannot block. 
None of these is called anywhere in the directory drivers/net,
so synchronize_irq() might address this.
