YES! - M$ is out there now and tries to overcome Linux. It's old David

Dear Dick,
you forgot to mention that the "heros" from ZD-Net (well known M$-Zombies)
tested NT 4.0 against a Linux Kernel 2.0.35/36 - not against the current
2.2.0.- And the test was on a UP system. - How boring! They should
test it with an NT-SMP-Box against Linux 2.2.0 - SMP. I guess Bill G. 
will let have his developers a famous last cigarette in front
of a white wall if he ever will see the results for such comparison.

YES! - This seems to be GRANTED since Linux 2.2.0 is out now! :-)
Keep up the good work, guys!
Best regards,
	Herbert
