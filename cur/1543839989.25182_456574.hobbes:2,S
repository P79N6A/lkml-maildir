These are skbs pre-allocated by the aoe driver that will always have
enough room to accomodate this much data, and we are really setting
the packet header length.
To use skb_put here seems awkward.  We'd have to do things like shown
below throughout the driver instead of just setting the length.  Is
that what you'd like to see?
