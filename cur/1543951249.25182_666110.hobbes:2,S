I never got a reply about this. Again: how can the modern slab allocator
avoid the need for internode alignment in order to prevent cacheline
pingpong on vsmp? Because I'm going to resubmit the SMP_ALIGN patch.
Also, the last I heard about the HWCACHE_ALIGN from you is that it didn't
make sense... I see it's merged now, which I appreciate, but I think it is
really important that we're on the same page here, so let me know if it
still doesn't make sense.
Thanks,
Nick
