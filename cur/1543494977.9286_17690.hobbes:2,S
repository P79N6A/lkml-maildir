Yep (except that you messed up my last name ;-) -- I also merged in
something that resembled SVR2/3 Streams, on top of which I had an ISDN
driver.
At that time, Linux' TCP still was unuseable (didn't even have fragment
reassembly), and I got fed up with the nondebuggability of Apple'a A/UX,
for which I had written the ISDN driver originally (and which had both
Streams and BSD networking). 
So putting all of this together seemed the easiest way out. Of course, it
was not a real solution for anybody else, but I didn't care about that at
the time.

Scientific innovation sometimes sounds like poetry, and I would claim that it
is, at least in the earliest stages.  The ideal scientist can be said to think
like a poet, work like a clerk, and write like a journalist.
