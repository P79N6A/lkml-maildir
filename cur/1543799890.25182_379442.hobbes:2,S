So... I guess I found out what is going on.
When power is unplugged, X32 adds C4 state. When power is plugged, X32
removes C4 state (behaviour Ted seen). When I load ipw2200, this
behaviour stops, and I see everything up-to C4. Strange. I remember
ipw had some problems with C3 and C4, perhaps this is related?
