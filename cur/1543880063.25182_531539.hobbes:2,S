yeah, debug only. I strongly suspect the Kaffeine breakage for example 
was related to child-runs-first, so userspace developers might be 
interested in a switch to turn this on/off.
while reviewing the upstream scheduler it occured to me that we are 
probably _not_ doing child-runs-first there due to the list_add_tail() 
[it should be a list_add() for it to be child-first. But i havent 
instrumented this heavily and this portion of the mainline scheduler is 
pretty fragile.]. So via this flag we could also see the performance 
impact, besides the compatibility impact.
