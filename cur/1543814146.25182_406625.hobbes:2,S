I don't care about above_background_load() being inline; that's done because 
all functions in header files need to be static inline to not become a mess.

I haven't checked but gcc may well inline weighted_cpuload anyway? We're 
moving away from inlining most things manually since the compiler is doing it 
well these days.

The way you're suggesting adds a function that is never used by anything but 
swap prefetch which would then need to be 'ifdef'ed out to not be needlessly 
built on every system. Adding ifdefs is frowned upon already, and to have an 
mm/ specific ifdef in sched.c would be rather ugly.
