    Gregory, I don't know for gimp (which is running fine here without
recompilation) but it seems that my gnome-terminal slowdown has gone
from pre-2 to pre-3.
    I just hope that someone had discovered and fixed the cause of this
problem
(that it's not a casual patch between pre2 and pre3) so we may be sure it
will
NOT happen again somewhere in 2.4...
