   I note the Intel card is pretty expensive. What are these "Addtron"
   cards I see listed on www.pricewatch.com for US$36 ?Is that a
   supported card under another name?
Probably Natsemi chipset based, it's not a good performer at all.

   When is the E1000 driver going to be added to the kernel?
   
It's in 2.5.x already... It will hit 2.4.x as soon as Intel's
QA signs off on what Jeff Garzik currently has (which is in VGER
2.4.x CVS branch btw if you want to check it out).
