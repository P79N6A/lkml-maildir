Note that the poll() approach would simply mean that the file browser
would have each directory that it displays open - and running poll on
them. Whenever poll indicates that the directory changed, it re-reads the
directory and updates as necessary.
One argument I have heard and partially buy into is that this doesn't work
over networked files, but it actually _does_ work fairly well: the kernel
has to have the logic to check up-to-datedness anyway, so that could be
extended fairly easily (but yes, networked filesystems would probably have
a minute or two before they noticed remote updates).
