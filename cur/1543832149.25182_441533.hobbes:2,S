sg3_utils is a package of command line utilities for sending
SCSI (and some ATA) commands to devices. This package targets
the linux kernel (lk) 2.6 and lk 2.4 series. In the lk 2.6
series these utilities (except sgp_dd) can be used with any
devices that support the SG_IO ioctl.
A subset of the utilities in this package will build on FreeBSD
and Tru64.
This version adds the sg_vpd and sg_rdac utilities. There are
examples of using the SAT ATA pass through SCSI command.
Exit status values have been expanded and made more consistent.
See the CHANGELOG for more information.
A tarball, rpm and deb can be found at (see table 2):
