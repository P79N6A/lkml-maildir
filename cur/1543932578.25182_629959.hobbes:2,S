Here are the checks from net/core/netpoll.c:__netpoll_rx:
        if (np->local_ip && np->local_ip != ntohl(iph->daddr))
                goto out;
        if (np->remote_ip && np->remote_ip != ntohl(iph->saddr))
                goto out;
        if (np->local_port && np->local_port != ntohs(uh->dest))
                goto out;
In other words, we DON'T check remote_port and we don't check the
local_port, local_ip, or remote_ip if they're zero. Sorry for the
earlier confusion.
My hazy memory here is that my version of kgdboe took the first packet
it got and set remote_port from it so that it could reply. Not sure
whether that got copied as I can't seem to find the relevant bits in
the latest -mm.
