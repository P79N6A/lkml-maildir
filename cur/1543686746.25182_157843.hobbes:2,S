Well is has been argued that the lack of locking in the random driver is a
"feature", adding a little more unpredictability.
Now I don't know if that makes sense or not, but the locking certainly has
a cost.  If it doesn't actually fix anything then that cost becomes a
waste.
IOW: what bug does that locking fix?
