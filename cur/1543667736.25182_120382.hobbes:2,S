Which is good, I think.  It annotates the source.

I don't understand this point.  'struct user_space' will never be
defined.  The C compiler ensure that 'struct user_space *p' cannot be
dereferenced then, since it will be a pointer to an incomplete type.
I don't see any difference between
  struct foo { char *p; };
and 
  struct foo { user_space *p; };
in terms of the code generated.  (On second reading, I don't think
this was your point though).
