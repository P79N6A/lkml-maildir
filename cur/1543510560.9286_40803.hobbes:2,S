Sorry to create a new thread -- I've seen this problem before, but I don't
have the subject for it.
With kernel 2.3.18ac8 running on a K6-3 400 I sporadically get mail
problems. The character ^@ is smeared all over a mail message instead of
the text. Other people have reported this problem. I remember it happening
with a previous ac kernel, but not which one :(
