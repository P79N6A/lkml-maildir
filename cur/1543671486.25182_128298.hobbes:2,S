I get following (hand copied) Oops at init when booting 2.5.68-mm2. As the 
last message diplayed is "Setting up network device eth0" I think the reason 
is loading the module 8130too or any of its dependencies. (My .config is not 
attached, but if missed I'll send it to you).

P.S.: Even if the keyboard works at this stage and for example 
<SHIFT><Scroll-Lock> works, the SysReq doesn't. But the support for it should 
have been compiled in...
