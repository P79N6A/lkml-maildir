Not sure its a good idea to overload page_has_private() with an
overloadable page-flag. What if some future FS wants to use
PG_owner_priv_2 for other purposes?
Obviously filesystems cannot use these two page-flags if they want to be
compatible with FS-cache, but need all filesystems be?
(also, ouch! - 2 pageflags)
