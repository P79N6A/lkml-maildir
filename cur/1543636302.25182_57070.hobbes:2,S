yes - the 'synchronous wakeup' feature is a form of gang scheduling. It in
essence uses real process-communication information to migrate 'related'
tasks to the same CPU. So it's automatic, no need to declare processes to
be part of a 'gang' in some formal (and thus fundamentally imperfect) way.
(another form of 'gang scheduling' can be achieved by binding the 'parent'
process to a single CPU - all children will be bound to that CPU as well.)
