Indeed.  The best way IMO to establish exactly what the card can handle
would be to generate audio signals on arbitrary frequencies and then try
to tune them.  Sometimes the data sheets lie ... also, I've found that a
board's implementation of the design often excludes a feature or two
that's technically available on the tuner chip or similar.
If someone finds that they can pick up a signal outside the range in the
kernel reliably, then expansion of that range is probably warranted.
Anything else is just guesswork unless it's based on some authoritative
source of information for the hardware in question.
