Hi Con. It changes the behaviour of my testcase, yes, but it doesn't cure the 
problem. When swap_token_timeout is the default 300 the screen freezes are 
longer in duration, about 30 seconds. With a swap_token_timeout of 0, max 
screen freezeis about 10 seconds, inter-foliated with freezes of less length.
On a positive note, the _total_ time of "unstability" is equal in both cases. 
Which in my animation test means 6 minutes. I said 3 previously, but that 
was wrong. Didn't let it run long enough.
Cheers,
Mats Johannesson
