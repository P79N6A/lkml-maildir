Hello, 
I use this program to 2.4.20 kernel version, on such a Novell SCSI HDD
that has 2 volumes, but with different block size (SYS 4k/block,VOL1
16k/block). It found the Novell partition, but did not found volumes. 
I use this version: nwfs1201-01.tar.gz 
Thanks for your help in advance. 
Regards, 
Jozsef Bus
