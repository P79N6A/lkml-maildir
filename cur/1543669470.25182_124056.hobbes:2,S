Subject: [PATCH] duplicate PID fix for 2.4

Hello,
We found a problem that after a full pid situation occurs,
duplicate pids may be allocated.  A patch is attached to
this mail.  This happens only on 2.4.
Marcelo, please apply.
The detail is described below:
In get_pid(), a free pid is searched through all task_structs
even when there is no free pid.  If all pids are already allocated,
the kernel exits the loop with 'next_safe' untouched.
	if(last_pid >= next_safe) {
inside:
		next_safe = PID_MAX;
		read_lock(&tasklist_lock);
repeat:
	for_each_task(p) {
		if(p->pid == last_pid	||
		   p->pgrp == last_pid	||
		   p->tgid == last_pid	||
		   p->session == last_pid) {			<= (A)
			if(++last_pid >= next_safe) {		<= (B)
				if(last_pid & 0xffff8000)
					last_pid = 300;
				next_safe = PID_MAX;
			}
			if(unlikely(last_pid == beginpid))	<= (C)
				goto nomorepids;
			goto repeat;
		}
	...
	}
In a rare case, both (B) and (C) can be true and then, next_safe
will remain PID_MAX (32768).  In that case, following get_pid() will
always succeed until last_pid reaches 32768 and there may be duplicate
pids.
When this happens?
As 'beginpid' is the pid of the process that created by the last fork(),
the task_struct of that process should be located at the tail of
the task_struct list.  So one might think that if (C) is true,
all the task_structs are scanned and (B) will never be possible
on the ground that when we are all through the task_struct list,
next_safe shuould be beginpid+1.
But this assumption is wrong because in (B), last_pid is
pre-incremented so in (A), last_pid == beginpid-1.
If the PID=beginpid-1 process is on very early in
the task_struct list, (B) is possible.
To protect this case is simple: when the condition (C) is true,
set next_safe to 0 or any safe value to guarantee that a free pid
will be searched through next time.  Or simply move (C) before (B),
which also guarantees next time search because at that point
next_safe is beginpid+1.
We prefer the former because it explicitly sets next_safe
so that the next time search is guaranteed.
Thanks,
