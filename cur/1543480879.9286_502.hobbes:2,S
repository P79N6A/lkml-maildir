   Partition table is fine.
   With either CPU fsck fails.
   I tried the frist 10 superblocks (1,8193,16385,24577,...,81921)
   all report not ext2fs.
Well if the partition table is fine, then the filesystem is probably
toast.  You can *try* recovering by doing a "mke2fs -S" on the
partition, but this is really a last-ditch try.  (Read the man page for
the appropriate warnings.)   Make sure the partition table is exactly as
it was when the filesystem was originally defined before running the
mke2fs -S, since otherwise this mke2fs command can damage a lot of data,
perhaps beyond repair.
