Pauline/Alan,
I have been studying the SCI code and I think I may have a workaround that
won't need the patch, but it will require pinning large chunks of memory 
with the existing __get_free_pages() functions.  I will need to make the 
changes and test them.   This change will require significant testing.  I will
ping you guys if I have questions.  If we can reach a compromise on the 
bigphysarea patch, it would be great, but absent this, I will be looking
at this alternate solution.
The real question is how to guarantee that these pages will be contiguous
in memory.  The slab allocator may also work, but I think there are size
constraints on how much I can get in one pass.
:-)
