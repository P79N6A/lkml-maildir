 As you obviously completely ignored my previous point, I'll reiterate it.
 1. You run Linus' split-into-config.in script on a 2.4 tree.
 2. You add whatever Config.ins have been updated to the 2.4 config.ins
 3. You regenerate with the find example I showed in the other mail.
 There. 2.4 Configure.help up to date with latest symbols, but
 containing none of the 2.5 ones.
