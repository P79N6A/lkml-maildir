If you have a second computer available, I highly recommend using kgdbstub
which can be found on sourceforge. This gives you source level debugging in
the kernel. Just put a breakpoint in sys_mount(), or whatever it is called
and see what happens.
Linus is dead set against using a debugger in daily development but it is a
very valuable tool for quickly gaining insight.
