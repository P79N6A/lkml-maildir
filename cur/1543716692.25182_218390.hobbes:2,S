I try to keep patches in the expected merge-up order.  The patching order
is in the series file - see the `patch-series' symlink in the kerne.org
directory.

Planned for shortly after 2.6.6 are:
sched-domains
rmap 7-14		(15-23 probably a week later)
numa api

I confess to being vaguely stunned that it is possible to generate a ~20
patch series againt the bitmap code.  I'll pay more attention next time it
