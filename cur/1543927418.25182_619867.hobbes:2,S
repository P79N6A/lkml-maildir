The other *ALIGN* macros in there are only good for power-of-2 alignments
so I guess Herbert's change is OK.
The whole thing's a bit crufty really - there's no reason why it _can't_
work on non-power-of-2 numbers 9via an implementation such as you suggest)
and there's no commentary in there explaining that this will presently
break things.
Those macros are sufficiently obscure, risky and undocumented as to make
them of dubious value IMO.  I mean, anything which forces you to go and
stare at the definition for a while when reviewing a callsite isn't worth
it.
