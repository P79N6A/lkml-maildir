I have a pretty good idea of what goes into the core and
what goes into the specific interface modules (spi, parallel, etc).

This is exactly the case for my board, but it doesn´t change anything
to the programming side of things, apart for the fact that the FPGA
must be configured before using any in-FPGA PCI bus for example.

I think that for the moment, I will focus on implementing the core
module and the parallel/SPI interfaces only. Later we may want to add
more fonctionality (vendors, JTAG, etc).
But for now, my main problem is that I need to have some insight on how
I actually implement the different modules:
Bus driver?
class driver?
platform driver?
Can anybody give some advice on that?
Thank-you, Hugo.
