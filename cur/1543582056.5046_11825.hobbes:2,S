Please, I think it would be much more useful a patch against the latest
2.2.19-pre (if that one for 2.2.18 does not work, I have not tried)
and the latest 2.4.1-ac14, that is what people experiments with.
People who has still a 2.2.14 or 16 looks like does not worry too much
about updating and building kernels, and it they go into the work, they
can just go to 2.2.18, compatible with 16 and 14 and much more stable.
I think it is better to work for preX kernels than for eldely ones.
