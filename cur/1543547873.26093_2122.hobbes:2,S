: I mean show me real code, not hypothetical examples.

Like code that I'm doing currently though not ready and not to be
included into the main kernel.  The point is that corresponding IPv4
symbols are exported as well why should we restrict IPv6?  I bet after
IPv6 is used more commonly the need for the symbols will come.  The thing
I've noticed programming various kernel modules is that the real pain in
the ass always is that the symbols you need aren't exported. :)  I think
that interface programmers should think whether their public interfaces
might be needed from the modules and export symbols accordingly.
