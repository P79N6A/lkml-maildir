I have run into a small problem while booting the newer dev kernels
2.3.4[56789]. At the lilo prompt I pass ide0=0xf700,0xf802
ide1=0xf900,0xfa02 to use a promise ata/66 io card. I don't know
what changed but in newer kernels the onboard io interfaces are
loaded first (even when I have "Boot off-board chipsets first
support" set in menuconfig.) Any tips??
Thanks, Thomas
