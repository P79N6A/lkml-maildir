Are you sure?  I would think that all machines would have the same byte and 
bit endian, otherwise you'd never be able to put a 16-bit value into a shift 
register.  Your bits will be shifted out like this:
<-- 07 06 05 04 03 02 01 00 15 14 13 12 11 10 09 08
So I think x86 is:
---LSB-- ---2SB-- ---3SB-- ---MSB-- [bytes] LITTLE_ENDIAN
L234567M L234567M L234567M L234567M  [bits] LITTLE_ENDIAN_BITFIELD
