The OOPS nolonger happened BUT it is useless as
XFree86-4.2.0 has problem with dri for i810; in the
XFree86 log file it says Direct rendering is enabled.
But run glxinfo shows that no other software can use
it!. I have searched and found a lot users have the
same thing. although I am quite sure that I installed
it properly (rm all old libGl etc...)
Go back to XFree86-4.1.0 compile 2.4.19-rc1-ac3 with
new dri modules; the oop also disappear. (That oops I
reported last time is with the old dri modules); I
thought wow it should be fine, but still no luck. run
glxinfo is fine; but run real application like
bzflags; bzflags can not run, it hang forever. No
OOPS, nothing, everything seems to be normal. Have to
killall -9  bzflag (15 doesn't stop it). Not sure what
caused this; Go back to use kernel 2.4.18-ck4  
everything is in order :-)
