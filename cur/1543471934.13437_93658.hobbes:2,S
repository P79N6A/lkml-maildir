You are looking at the kernels own locking subsystem not the locks done
by the glibc thread library

That would just be crap userspace code. A good userspace lock does direct
CPU dependant spin locking briefly, then sched_yield a few times then
either backs off or drops to a semaphore lock.

I the pipeline length is strictly bounded, and the objects in it are
type constant do you need any locking anyway. It ought to be almost lockless
