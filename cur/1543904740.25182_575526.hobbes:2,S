if you propose removing code in such a way that performance suffers then 
yes, it's hard to remove (and it should be).
but if it has no API the code is only visable to the users as a side 
effect of it's use. if the new code works better then it can be replaced.
the scheduler change that we're going through right now is an example, new 
code came along that was better and the old code went away very quickly.
the SLAB/SLOB/SLUB/S**B debate is another example. currently the different 
versions have different performance advantages and disadvantages, as one 
drops behind to the point where one of the others is better at all times, 
it goes away.

a large part of this is that it's so hard to get a replacement that works 
better (this is very definantly a compliment to the kernel coders :-)

for userspace API's 10 years is reasonable, for internal features it's 
not. there is a LOT of internal stuff that was in the kernel 10 (or even 
5) years ago that isn't there now. the key is that the behavior as far as 
users is concerned is better now.
