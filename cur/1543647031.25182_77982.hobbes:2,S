Playing the devil's advocate here...  I didn't see this earlier (when
was it discussed, I can't see it looking back either), so sorry if
this sounds circular or I'm going over stuff that has been discussed
before... but...

OK.  What might use this though?  What applications might want to
disable the page-cache but still use write-behind?

It depends on the OS.  Some OS are broken and treat O_DIRECT as a
hint, Linux and IRIX know it's a *requirement*.

Actually, this sounds perfect for O_DIRECT.  But I don't know much
about streaming video.
Since you only want the data once, why use the page-cache at all and
needlessly copy?  Certainly, the requirements for O_DIRECT are not
that hard to meet or implement.
Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying this is a bad thing at all.  The
patch is small and elegant so it's hard to object; I'm just trying to
understand where in practice I would use this over O_DIRECT.
