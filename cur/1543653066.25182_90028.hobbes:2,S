Andrea, this makes a difference! The pausings are much less than before, but 
still occur. Situation below.
Another thing I've noticed, while doing the "cp -a xyz abc" in 
a loop the available memory decreases alot (silly caching of files)
Before copying:
---------------
MemTotal:       515992 kB
MemFree:        440876 kB
Buffers:          3808 kB
Cached:          24128 kB
While copying:
--------------
root@codeman:[/usr/src] # ./bla.sh
+ cd /usr/src
+ rm -rf linux-2.4.19-blaold linux-2.4.19-blanew
+ COUNT=0
+ echo 0
0
+ cp -a linux-2.4.19-vanilla linux-2.4.19-blaold
+ cp -a linux-2.4.19-vanilla linux-2.4.19-blanew
not yet finished the above and memory is this:
MemTotal:       515992 kB
MemFree:          3348 kB
Buffers:         12244 kB
Cached:         451608 kB
swap (500mb) turned off. Pausings are almost none. (without your patch / 
elvtune) even there were massive pauses.
If swap is turned on, swapusage grows alot and then, if SWAP is used, we have 
pauses (even more less than without your patch).
To free the used/cached memory I use umount /usr/src.
I think your proposal is good. Anything else I should test/change? Any further 
informations/test I can/should run?
Thnx alot!
ciao, Marc
