This message is directed at those almighty kernel developers.
I have a Epox MVP3GM Mother board. When I shut down the system, that is
power off, the kernel simply responds by crashing (After it's killed all
the service). For some reason, it isn't the VIA82c586 Chipset. I've
installed on a similar motherboard (slightly inferior - Epox MVP3CM,
which has the same chipset) and this hasn't had any kernel oopses when
shutting down.
I've used Kernel 2.2.5-15, and 2.2.9, and the oops happens on both
kernels. I've tried with and without the experimental VIA82c586 driver,
and it's still the case.
I hope this helps you somewhat, if you were'nt apparent with this oops.
However, I'm not sure whether it's my RAM or CPU, although Windoze shuts
it down properly. Maybe it's because I've only got one PCI slot left
(rest is filled up).
Anyway, this mail is just to enlighten you on this oops. Once again,
I'll say that this helps you somewhat. If you wan't the kernel oppose, I
can send you the screen I get when it crashes. If you need this, just
ask me (send an e-mail).
Good Luck.
