Precisely. Not coming from a computer science background, the jargon
sometimes gets the better of me ;-)
I was playing around with ip_build_xmit_slow() looking at alternatives
for fixing the MSG_DONTWAIT fragmentation bug mentioned on this list a
couple of weeks ago, when I noticed that it can call kfree_skb() from
a process context. This again means that write_space() can get called
without being wrapped in a local_bh_disable()/local_bh_enable() -
style protection against softirqs.
Cheers,
