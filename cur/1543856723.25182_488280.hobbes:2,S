Why would we run reclaim against a section of a zone?

Mel aready has that for anti-frag. The sections are per MAX_ORDER area 
and the only states are movable unmovable and reclaimable. There is 
nothing more to it. No other state information should be added. Why would 
we need sub zones? For what purpose?

What feature are you talking about?
Why would all allocations need to be movable when we have a portion for 
unmovable allocations?
