This is a heads up that the next 2.6.17-stable review cycle will be
starting in about 24 hours.  I've caught up on all pending -stable
patches that I know about and placed them in our queue, which can be
browsed online at:
	
http://www.kernel.org/git/?p=linux/kernel/git/stable/stable-queue.git;a=tree;f=queue-2.6.17
If anyone sees that this queue is missing something that they feel
should get into the next 2.6.17-stable release, please let us know at
stable@kernel.org within the next 24 hours or so.
thanks,
greg k-h
