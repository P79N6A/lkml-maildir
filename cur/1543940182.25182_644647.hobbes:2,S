You started with claiming "LTP scripts are written to be POSIX 
complaint" and now that I've shown you a not that uncommon IEEE POSIX 
1003.2 compliant shell that can't cope with your non-POSIX script you 
suddenly introduce the word "relevant".
But when you care only about "relevant" shells you could simply 
implementing my suggestion of placing a #!/bin/bash at the top of your 
scripts instead of defining your own POSIX superset that you require 
from a /bin/sh for allowing a user to execute your script...
