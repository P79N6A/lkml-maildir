Subject: [PATCH] drivers/usb/core/message.c: Replacing yield() with a better alternative
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/10/11/116

In 2.6, the semantics of calling yield() changed from "sleep for a
bit" to "I really don't want to run for a while".  This matches POSIX
better, but there's a lot of drivers still using yield() when they mean
cond_resched(), schedule() or even schedule_timeout().
For this driver cond_resched() seems to be a better
alternative
Tested compile only
