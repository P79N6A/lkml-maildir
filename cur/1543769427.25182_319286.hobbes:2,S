Server must be SMP
Two clients; on each of them untar/cat/delete kernel trees.
You want a few million files on the FS in order to confuse the server
sufficiently for it to screw up severely.
Make sure you keep lots of things going concurrently on the clients.
And don't run as root - common problems are also that files get wrong
ownership/modes (a file created by one unprivileged user shows up as
belonging to another unprivileged user - files can show up with modes
d---------)
I guess RH could have patched up a 2.6.9 to include whatever fixes (more
than one!) for the issues that were resolved from 2.6.9 to 2.6.11.
