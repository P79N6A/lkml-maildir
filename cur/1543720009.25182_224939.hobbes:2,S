Sisfb has been using panning for ages and I never saw or heard about 
screen corruption. Looks very much like the radeon driver is skrewed...
However, I don't think the engine is "incompatible" with panning. 
Panning means just to change the display start address, I can't imaging 
that the engine would care about that.
What sort of "screen corruption" do you get?
