Does anyone know if these changes are in the kernel?  Basically SGI has
supposedly improved linux to do multidisk array IO access o0r something that
improves disk IO on multiprocessor systems.  I am not sure how thou.  IF
this is a kernel change does anyone know if it will make its way into the
kernel tree?
