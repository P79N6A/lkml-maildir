Looking at each of the (many) macros in there is on my TODO list, but fixing 
macros was not the point of this patch.

The reason behind the change is manyfold.
The first reason is consistency. Function parameters that span over more than 
one line should be indented identical for each such function in the file (and 
preferably across files as well).  The changes made by this patch make all 
such functions the same within floppy.c
The second reason is that indenting two tabs seems to make the most sense for 
a few reasons;  
	a) not indenting at all is ugly, plain and simple.
		void function(int a, int b,
		int c, int d, int e)
		{
			int foo;
			int bar;
		...
		}
	b) indenting only one tab stop puts parameters at the same indent level as
	   variables in the function which is potentially confusing (at least IMHO).
		void function(int a, int b,
			int c, int d, int e)
		{
			int foo;
			int bar;
		...
		}
	c) Indenting so that all parameter lines start at the opening paranthesis 
	   rarely matches up with tabs so you have to use varying amounts of spaces
	   depending on how long the function name is. Not a good solution IMHO.
		void function(int a, int b,
				     int c, int d, int e)
		{
			int foo;
			int bar;
		...
		}
	d) Indenting by two tab stops avoids the problems with a, b & c and also
	   avoids indenting so much so that the number of lines needed (when all
	   need to be kept <80 col) is not increased too much in most cases. 
		void function(int a, int b,
				int c, int d, int e)
		{
			int foo;
			int bar;
		...
		}
I also have a recollection (although I can't find the exact threads atm) that 
in the past the question of how to indent function parameters that span more 
than one line, settled on two tabs.
I hope that explains my reasons for making the change :-)
This should probably go into CodingStyle if some official consensus on this 
can be reached.
