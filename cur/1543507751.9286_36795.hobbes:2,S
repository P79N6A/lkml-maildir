This one has been there for a while, and I finally sat
down just now to track it down.
What I see is that the generic cdrom driver is passing
down packet commands with a buffer length which is
negative.  I see that some of the cgc command building
routines are setting negative buffer lengths on purpose.
This is illegal and is confusing SCSI drivers quite
badly, because the scsi command will have
SCpnt->request_bufflen < 0 and this will be given to
the controller for the DMA request.
I don't know what the intentions were here, but this
does need to be fixed somehow so I leave it to Jens
to figure out the correct fix.
Thanks.
Later,
