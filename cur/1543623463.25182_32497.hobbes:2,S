   How are you setting the mtu, with:
   /sbin/ifconfig ${DEV} mtu 9000
   
   or something like that?  Hmmm...
Wait, even more importantly are you going through a switch?
Most gigabit switches don't support 9000 byte mtu :-)
You're probably said that you're over a cross-over cable
direct connect and I've just forgotten.
