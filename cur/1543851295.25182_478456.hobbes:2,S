Well, only if the module is well-behaved in the first place, since a
kernel module can naturally bypass SELinux at will.  What drives this
approach vs. exempting the module from SELinux checking via a task flag
that it raises and lowers around the access (vs. setting and resetting
the sid around the access to the per-cache module context)?

Do you mean security_transition_sid()?  security_change_sid() doesn't
seem suited to that purpose (relabeling vs. transition computations).
What would you use as the target SID and class?  What happens if there
is no transition/change rule in the policy?  It seems like the default
behavior would leave it operating in the context of the daemon itself,
in which case you might end up denying access to the module upon
creation?

I think you would want this to be a new ->fssid field instead, and
adjust SELinux to use it if set for permission checking (which could
also be leveraged by NFS later).  Or just use a task flag to disable
checking on the module internal accesses.

I don't quite follow this.  The cache module needs to be able to perform
cache access on behalf of any process, including multi-threaded ones,
and the security struct is per-task just like fsuid/fsgid.  But mutating
->sid could yield unfortunate behavior if e.g. another process happens
to be sending that task a signal at the same time, so if you go this
route, you want a ->fssid.
