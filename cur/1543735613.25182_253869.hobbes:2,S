Hi Max,
Please try 2.6.9-rc2-mm1 and see if you can reproduce the problem there. 
If you can, please apply the attached patch and wait for the OOM killer to trigger.
Doing so will show us how many swap pages were free at the moment of the killing,
if there was swap space available there's something wrong.
