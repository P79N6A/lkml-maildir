I wonder why Linux do not have a good performance monitoring facility in 
kernel. For example, there are no place in /proc to read counters like page 
cache, dcache hit ratio, disk queue length,, etc. does such info and tool 
already existed? thx.
(i am not on this list, so pls cc to me as well, thx)
