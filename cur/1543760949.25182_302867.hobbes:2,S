Eh... sure, but... the bug was reported because the system was attempting to 
update the cmos clock (which it does every ~11 min.) during APM exit.   It does 
this IF AND ONLY IF the system is synced to an external source as indicated by 
the STA_UNSYNC bit being cleared in the time_state.  Now, I don't know what or 
how APM and NTP are supposed to play together, but I suspect that on entry to 
APM time is no longer synced, thus my comment.
As to your comment, the bug would never have shown its ugly face if the system 
wasn't using NTP.
