A process can't grab a kernel lock and then switch
back to user mode, can it?    (if it could, I can
imagine some nasty DoS attacks...)
Problem is, when we decide to schedule in a process
or not, we know the process was last stuck in
schedule() ... in kernel mode ;(
I'd love to be proven wrong though ... this would be
some extremely useful functionality ;)

Rik
