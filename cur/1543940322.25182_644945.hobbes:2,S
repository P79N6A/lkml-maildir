Well, Andrew already pointed out some of this, but I do want more 
information. There's a "git request-pull" script that even comes with git 
and that generates a shortlog, a proper url+branch description, and a 
diffstat of the changes.
So that is already much more descriptive, but in addition to that, if this 
isn't one of the "regular" pulls (which it obviously isn't), I really want 
a human description too so that I know what I'm pulling and what it's all 
about.
I do *not* want to be in the position of having to fetch first, just to be 
able to look at what I'm fetching. By the time I pull a branch, I want to 
basically know (a) what I'm pulling and (b) why I _want_ to pull it.
