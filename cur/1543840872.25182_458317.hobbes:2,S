Nifty (aka "dumb") idea: would it make sense to enable drivers to register a
callback "we're going to go idle now" to e.g. let a driver refill or
service its hardware buffers the very moment before idling? That way
a driver could increase its announced latency requirements,
allowing longer idle sleeps until a hardware buffer overflows or whatever
(but in many cases a hardware service issue would be covered by an IRQ then).
However the time scales involved here (a couple of microseconds per sleep
or so versus a possibly comparably big amount of processing time per callback)
could render such a thing impractical, especially when multiple drivers
and thus multiple callbacks are involved (one might need to watch
total callback processing time then).
