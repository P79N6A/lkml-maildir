in 2.6.0-test3-bk1 and previous 2.6.0 tests there are some config voices that give problems if set to modules...
i attach a brief log and my .config
as you can see i have my root on a jfs filesystem an choosed to have other filesystem support compiled as module. this because when the kernel image becomes big my laptop reboots just after having loaded it (can't understand well why :).
anyway i've got a previous 2.6.0-test2-bk6 image that works fine with those filesystem support linked statically and have no hurry, let me know if you'd like me to do some more tries.
thank you
cheers
