gcc-2.95 is egcs-1.1.2 + assorted patches. It is just it's descendant. pgcc
includes Pentium-specific patches that aren't acceptable to the gcc folks
(for various reasons). pgcc-1.1.2 is another offshot of egcs-1.1.2,
essentially.

The safest bet would be gcc-2.95. IKD might change stuff enough to make the
bug go into hiding... and with a non-standard compiler you'd never know who
the final culprit was, anyway. BTW, it isn't necesarily the kernel who is to
blame.
