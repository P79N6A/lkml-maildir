But do you use an initrd that tries to load the same driver too?
I'm too lazy to want to do my own initrd. I just use the prepackaged ones 
and rely on the fact that my private kernel will refuse to load modules 
that aren't meant for it anyway.

Mine says "2".

That *is* the git version you're running: e374a2bf.
The "-g" is for "git" and the "-dirty" is because you have some 
non-checked-in changes in addition.
I works for me:
	[torvalds@hp linux]$ git show --abbrev-commit -s --pretty=oneline e374a2bf
	e374a2b... Kobject: fix coding style issues in kobject c files
so that looks like a valid version..
