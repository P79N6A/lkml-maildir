  Hi, all. Version 90 of my devfs patch is now available from:
http://www.atnf.csiro.au/~rgooch/linux/kernel-patches.html
The devfs FAQ is also available here.
This is against 2.2.0. Highlights of this release:
- CONFIG_DEVFS_DISABLE_OLD_TTY_NAMES replaced with "nottycompat" boot
  option
- CONFIG_DEVFS_TTY_COMPAT removed: existing "symlinks" boot option now
  controls this. This means you must have libc 5.4.44 or later, or a
  recent version of libc 6 if you use the "symlinks" option
				Regards,
					Richard....
