Yes.  The situation where one task is on two waitqueues
is rare, but does happen.  And yes, there is code out there
which does a bare schedule() and *assumes* that once the
schedule has returned, the thing it was waiting for has
indeed occurred.
Generally this is poor practice - it's safer to loop
over the schedule() call until the condition you're
sleeping on has been tested.
You really shouldn't be sleeping in this way on tq_scheduler
if there's any way in which the sleep can take an extended
period of time.  You may end up putting important kernel
tasks to sleep.
Best to use schedule_task(), or an independent kernel thread.
