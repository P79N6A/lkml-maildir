The patch worked well, thanks
I still observe some uneven mouse behaviour during
compilations (linux kernel, make -j 6), like, when I slowly
move the mouse, it would stop for a split of a second every
few seconds (the intervals are not equal). On 2.6.23/24
it works very smooth. Of course, I can't say that the
scheduler is to be blamed. It was only my assumption
because I thought I might be confused by the
non-monotinic time, which I see is not the case.
Any ideas, how to debug this?
