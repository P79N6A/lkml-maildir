Can you explain the purpose of doing balance on both fork and exec?
The reason we did it at exec time is that it's much cheaper to do 
than at fork - you have very, very little state to deal with. The vast 
majority of things that fork will exec immediately thereafter.
Balance on clone make some sort of sense, since you know they're not
going to exec afterwards. We've thrashed through this many times before
and decided that unless there was an explicit hint from userspace,
balance on fork was not a good thing to do in the general case. Not only
based on a large range of testing, but also previous experience from other
Unix's. What new data came forth to change this?

Is that what it's actually doing now? That's not what Nick told me at
Kernel Summit, but is the correct thing to do for clone, I think.

Yup.
