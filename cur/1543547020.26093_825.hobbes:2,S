If it is in the header file I think it should be open for use.
Not allowing inline code to be used just adds another hoop to jump. Just
compile with that function explicitly defined. Define another version in
the kernel and use that in your module instead. Etc.
There was another thread a few days ago commenting that modern processors
may actually be a bit faster with less inlined code and unrolled loops. Which
may mean that a lot of what is now inlined may be better off compiled in.
