It's not the expected wake up time being computed.  It's the expected 
time that the task is selected to run after being put on the queue 
(either as a result of waking or being pre-empted).
I think that your comments below are mainly invalid because of this 
understanding.

This is a point where misunderstanding results in a wrong conclusion. 
However, the notion of expected completion time is useful.  I'd 
calculate the expected completion time for the task as it goes on to the 
CPU and if while it is running a new task is queued whose expected "on 
CPU" time is before the current task's expected end time you can think 
about preempting when the new tasks "on CPU" task arrives -- how 
hard/easy this would be to implement is moot.

This is one point where the misunderstanding results in an invalid 
conclusion.  There is no need for credits as the use of the average time 
on CPU each cycle makes the necessary corrections that credits would be 
used to address.

I think this is overcomplicating matters.
However, some compensating credit might be in order for tasks that get 
pre-empted e.g. base their next expected "on CPU" time on the difference 
between their average on CPU time and they amount they got to use before 
they were pre-empted.

I think that with this model you can almost do away with the notion of a 
time slice but I need to think about that some more as the idea I have 
for doing that may have some gotchas.

There is only one potential exploit for this method that I can see (but 
that doesn't mean there aren't others) and that is a task that does 
virtually no CPU use when on the CPU and has very short sleeps such as 
the expected "on CPU" time is "right now" (and it's happening at high 
frequency due to the short sleeps), even when other tasks are running, 
due to the average "on CPU" time being zero. This could be defeated by 
using min(average "on CPU" time, some system dependent minimum).
In practice, it might be prudent to use the idea of maximum expected "on 
CPU" time instead of the average (especially if you're going to use this 
for triggering pre-emption).  This would be the average plus two or 
three time the standard deviation and has the down side that you have to 
calculate the standard deviation and that means a square root (of course 
we could use some less mathematically rigorous metric to approximate the 
standard deviation).  The advantage would be that streamer type programs 
such as audio/video applications would have very small standard 
deviations and would hence get earlier expected "on CPU" times than 
other tasks with similar averages but more random distribution.
