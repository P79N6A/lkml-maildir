I'm not totally convinced this makes it easier to read. To me,
CHARGE_ON(); is more readable than sharpsl_pm.machinfo->charge(1);. Yes,
you need to look up what the macro does but the names give a fairly good
idea.
ALso, keeping the macros means when I implement the LED trigger for
charging, I don't have to edit every function in sharpsl_pm but can just
tweak the header and add an extra level of LED functions. Given that,
I'd prefer to leave these as they are for now.

The percentage curves is likely to change in the future and I doubt
anyone would remember to update these values. I'd therefore prefer for
them to be independent of the lookup table.
(The table will change once I get more discharge profiles from users and
can work out a more accurate discharge curve).
