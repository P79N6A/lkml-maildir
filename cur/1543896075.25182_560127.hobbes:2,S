In Italy we say "habits are hard to die"...
In an (unanswered) thread, titled "[RFC] Auto-fixups for CodingStyle against 
major UML violations" from 31/3/2007, also CC'ed to you, Jeff and LKML, I 
published a script (reattached here) which integrates with quilt and kbuild 
to fix all sources for these violations. It is not indent based, consequently 
it does not do any damages that indent would do.
Plus, with just a couple of tiny changes (for substitutions implying the use 
of '^'), it can also be run on unified diffs.
The only problem is just coordinating to run it together on a source tree and 
on the patch set applying on it. Otherwise the patchset manager would get 
hard-to-fix rejects.
In the end: are you interested in this stuff? I'm busy right now but can work 
to apply these changes after this thursday (i.e. tomorrow). I'd need to get 
Jeff's patchset to fix it.
Please let me know.
Bye!
