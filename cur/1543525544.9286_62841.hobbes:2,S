Dear all,
I am awefully sorry that I have to drop in and interrupt you with 
this question.  It is simply so itching -- I've got to try IBM
ViaVoice under Linux and Chinese language dictation -- one of my
dream with Linux, but it simply can't record anything.
(I am a Chinese and ViaVoice could be ideal for me to write Chinese
Linux doc or living event reports.)
Yes, CMI8338/8738 chips ARE supported by cmpci.o in RedHat 6.1 or
later Mandrake distribution. I can happily playing MP3 in XMMS with it.
My problem is recording.
Motherboard:  
	PC100 (from a small Taiwan company maybe) integrated 
	with CMI8738 PCI and PCtel micromodem.
Platform:
	RedHat 6.1
Config:
	Automatically done by sndconfig.  The audio sample sounds 
	awefully harsh, but XMMS and gmixer works fine (with the
	playing back settings).
Problem:
	Can't record anything from any sources. But mic input can be
	heard in headphone, volumn/mute adjustment OK.
	dd /dev/audio > sample.au  and then
	cat sample.au > /dev/dsp   (the extact command I use is copied
	from Sound-HOWTO, didn't remember extactly here, (I am in Windoz)).
	produce nothing but quietness.
	cat /dev/sndstat   shows "no such device"
	no /proc/sound file, 
cat /proc/modules: (sorry can't remember the details
	cmpci
	sound_core
cat /proc/interrupts /proc/ioports, cmpci shows up there too.
What could be the problem ?  I wrote an email to the author of
cmpci.c but got no responce.  Should I have to reverse engine
Windoz driver and check cmpci.c line by line to find the reason ?
Could I debug a loadable kernel module without too much disturbing
of my normal use ?
Best regards,
Xiong Jiang
