   Both reports from kernel 2.2.15pre5
   cat /proc/sys/net/core/wmem_max causes an oops.
   Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 00000001 
   current->tss.cr3 = 02505000, %cr3 = 02505000 
There are no changes in the 2.2.15pre series which could
cause this, and in fact I mess with these values just
about every day and do not see an OOPS.
So perhaps you're seeing a compile bug, or similar.
What compiler do you use to build your kernels?
