The compatibility code is already in the kernel, just don't call it if 
e.g. there's a /kinit in initramfs. We can add the hooks to the kernel to 
pull whatever you want into the initramfs and with time we can remove 
the old code.
Why create new (temporary?) compatibility code, if the current code is 
working just fine?
bye, Roman
