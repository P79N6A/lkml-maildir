I'm not 100% certain... Paulus thinks all the old 6xx are like that, and
maybe POWER4. If I look at the oldest BookIV I can find (the 601), it
says that an exception is generated when the MSB transitions from 0 to
1. It's not clear wether the exception sticks while that bit is 1 or is
indeed considered as an "edge" event that gets cleared as soon as
delivered.
