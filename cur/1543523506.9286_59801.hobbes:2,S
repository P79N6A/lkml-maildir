Hi,
I've _exactly_ the same problem when I try to setup DMA on my HDD (hdparm -d1
/dev/hda)
I had an Intel mainboard with a PCII "Triton" chipset. The disk was able to run
with DMA on this board.
I've changed for a motherboard with a VIA "Appolo" chipset. With this card, I've
the same problem as yours.
The 'VIA' driver is said as 'experimental', so I suspect this driver. I suspect
a lack in the functionalities of this driver.
I run kernel 2.3.40 but I've the same problem with 2.2.14. This is even worse in
2.2.14 : I experienced crashes of my system !!
Best regards
Jean-Luc
