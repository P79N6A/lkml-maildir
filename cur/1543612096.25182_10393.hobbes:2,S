get_blkfops() and module {un,}loading.
Please, don't step into that mess right now - there's a bunch of bad races
in devfs-related side of ->bd_op handling and the last thing we need is
additional set of complications.
Naive fix won't work due to devfs mess and correct one will take serious
massage of generic code _and_ devfs.
Besides, for block devices ->open() and ->release() are absolutely not
interesting wrt BKL contention.  Just how often are they called?
