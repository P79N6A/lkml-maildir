    I've fiddled a bit with both the latency.c programs.  I've added some
    options to them etc.  In particular, now you can specify a program
    to run and monitor instead of a pid, which is handy if you need to
    monitor processes that exit quickly.  Everything is documented in
    the sources (attached).  I thought you might find this useful. :-)
Thank you much! yes, that will make it more useful.  I'll add it to my
backlog and see if I can't get it out to the web page this week.
