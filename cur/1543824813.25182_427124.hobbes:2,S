Sure - it doesn't use the assembler's .cfi_* directives, but encodes things manually. I'll still have to check why
you're getting these errors, as you should see entirely different ones if the assembler didn't support the directives at
all. Jan

btw, this cfi annotation code:
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.17-rc4/2.6.17-rc4-mm3/broken-out/kgdb-cfi_annotations.patch
compiles happily with that toolchain.
