I must say that it's not really clear to me why this fdmap thing was
created.  Exactly what problem is it solving, and what properties is it
designed to have?
Could not a (prehaps suitably modified) IDR tree have adequately provided
those properties?
I'm sure it's good stuff, but the patches were presented as if we all know
what they're for.  But I don't.  Maybe I was asleep at the time.
