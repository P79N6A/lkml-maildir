I did this originally, but it did not in fact user_install any new 
code!  I had to install the executables with mc, over-writing the 
sensors, sensors-detect and such files.  And, interesting is that 
while sensors-detect reports that its generated an .init file to be 
copied to /etc/rc.d/init.d/lm_sensors, it has never touched the 
lm_sensors.init file that comes out of the archive.  IMO, something 
is totally fubar (and I've nuked the srcdir and unpacked that 
lm_sensors-2.8.2 archive and re-run this several times now)

gkrellm-2.1.24 is running right now, and the builtins/sensors/info tab 
reports "No sensors detected." at the top of the window.  Everything 
else, including the ups watcher is running just fine.  Is there some 
way I can get some debugging info out of gkrellm when started from a 
cli?
