Subject: PCI wireless NIC: can't set MAC addr

Kernel is 2.4.20-pre11.
I seem to be unable to set MAC address on a D-Link
DWL-520 (a PCI wireless NIC). I am using 2.4.20-pre11
and orinoco_pci as a module.
It seems to work and I can see my frames with correct
MAC address with tcpdump. The problem is, other hosts
do not like me anymore :( I see zero incoming packets.
This happens even if I set MAC addr before bringing
iface up. I.e. no host can possibly cache stale ARP
data...
I suspect either orinoco driver does not set MAC addr
properly or firmware has a bug. BTW, firmware version
is 1.4.9.
I'd be grateful if someone with any wireless card
will do a quick check with their hardware/firmware/driver
combo and tell me the results.
