I'm pretty sure you need to be up to at leaset 0005 of 
the firmware to stabilize this drive.

It all depends on the access pattern.  The drive will only
fail if you fill its write cache.  At that point, it will
fall off the bus, never to return.

Depends on your settings.  If you are using the default, we
run a much larger number of concurrent transactions when
compared to the old driver.

If you aren't having problems with your BIOS today, there is
no reason to flash the BIOS on teh 2940U2W.

SCSI-Select option.
