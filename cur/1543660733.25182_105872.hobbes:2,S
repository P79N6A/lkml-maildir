Yes, but currently you need only 3 files: autoconf.h, version.h, and, eventually
.config, as other headers are read-only and nobody managed to get them
wrong (yet).
When using kernel Makefiles there are at least two more files (main and arch Makefile), 
of which main Makefile is known to be modified by vendors to get their cloneconfig
working: they define additional rules and variables, and you may run into conflict.

Increasing number of files needed to build module also increases possibility
that something will go wrong :-( Ok, I'll modify modules build script to
use kernel's build system if /lib/modules/`uname -r`/build/Makefile exists,
and I'll see. 
BTW, is there any way how code outside of Makefile can detect what file was 
generated and where it was stored: whether vmmon.o or vmmon.ko? As it is now,
Makefile contains obj-y := vmmon.o, but you can end up with vmmon.ko... I
need it to make a note for uninstaller which files we added to the system
(and which we can overwrite without prompting on upgrade).
