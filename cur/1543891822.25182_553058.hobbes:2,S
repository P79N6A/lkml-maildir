Greg,
I'm having problems cloning the stable git tree for 2.6.21.
Here's what I get:
$ git clone 
http://www.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-2.6.21.y.git
 stable-2.6.21.y
Cannot get remote repository information.
Perhaps git-update-server-info needs to be run there?
------
I believe I cloned this tree a few weeks ago successfully.
Did something break?
Thanks,
 -- Tim
