- Vendor requests error with the -32 errors often indicate the incorrect device.
> phy0 -> rt73usb_validate_eeprom: EEPROM recover - MAC: 66:76:2b:e8:68:e7
- Incorrect MAC address read from the device. Another hint that the device is not rt73.

> phy0 -> rt2x00_set_chip: Info - Chipset detected - rt: 1300, rf: 0000, rev: c03c0ae0
- A incorrect RF chipset. (valid values are: 1, 2, 3 or 4). Another indication of a incorrect device.
- A completely bogus chipset revision. A valid rt73 device has the revision "2573X" Where only the
  X is a variable.

No. You can assume you are forcing rt73 to control a non-rt73 device.
The fact that you had to hack to bypass the RT and RF chipset validation also confirms that,
those checks were there for a reason. Namely to make sure the corect driver was being used for the device.
