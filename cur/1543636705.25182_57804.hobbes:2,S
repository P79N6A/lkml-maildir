The blacklist thing is a good idea. Think for those who have been
just started learning linux. They don't know what an EXPERIMANTAL
status is. At my company there are only IBM ThinkPads and I hope
some of the users will try running Linux (my suggestion) and they
would be very upset if something went wrong.
Who is so crazy that he wants to try it he can still modify the
source.
