Hi Rudolf, hi @ all,
so we were just too concerned all the time & even though the
temperatures seem too high there's nothing to worry ?
I'd be more tranquilized if I had the old temperatures ;)
but like lm_sensors's output states - it's not bad until  I / we're
getting temperatures from 85°C (?) [in this particular case], ...
@lkml, Linus:
sorry for all the noise ;)
Len,
here's the output of sensors (lm_sensors):

it's the completely same temperatures - it had no effect on the
"correctness" of the output
thanks to everyone
