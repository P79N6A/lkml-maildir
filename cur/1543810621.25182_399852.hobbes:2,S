I found the problem, it's a typo in drivers/crypto/padlock-aes.c (introduced probably in the "[CRYPTO] Use standard byte order macros wherever possible" patch) and only happens with 256 bit keys.
it says below the "case 32:"
E_KEY[4] = le32_to_cpu(in_key[4]);
E_KEY[5] = le32_to_cpu(in_key[5]);
E_KEY[6] = le32_to_cpu(in_key[6]);
t = E_KEY[7] = le32_to_cpu(in_key[7]);
but it should be
E_KEY[4] = le32_to_cpu(key[4]);
E_KEY[5] = le32_to_cpu(key[5]);
E_KEY[6] = le32_to_cpu(key[6]);
t = E_KEY[7] = le32_to_cpu(key[7]);
Now it's working!
