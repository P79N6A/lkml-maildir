First, Merced does not suck on integer performance.
It does about 300 SPEC CPU2000 at 733MHz, give or take,
subject to compiler improvements.
That blows all RISCs out of the water (except Alpha, yet.
The best result they submitted is 511 base 533 peak
at 833MHz).

Man, where do you get this falsehood. TM-5400 is way, way
faster than Geode (several times for any benchmark).
This is exactly the reason why Transmetians love to
showcase DVD playing and other performance related
stuff - it is where they beat Geode. Geode's performance
is quite adequate for kiosk/POS app and it's a formiddable
competitor for anything that needs no performance.

"Beats" by what metric? Sucks harder?
