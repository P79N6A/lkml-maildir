I apreciate the effort and sentiment. However if you would look at the
output of 'free' (originaly attached files), you would notice i am
talking about free = (available + cache + buffer) and not just
'available' ;-)
This is a problem i only have on one of the 40 or so servers i manage,
however the one that has it is my personal gateway & firewall machine,
so it feels prety sore ;-)
There are one or two other people on the list who also had the same
problem, is it fixed for you guys, or still seeing the same problem? I'm
having the sneaking suspission this behaviour isnt gone yet.
Anyways, thanks for trying to educate james, however i only wish it was
that simple ;-)
