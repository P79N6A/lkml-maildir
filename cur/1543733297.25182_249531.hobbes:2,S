hmm, sounds reasonable, but what if root accesses it?
(or somebody with the 'right' capability)
 - it might be strange if even root is not able to
   open device nodes or execute files from an archive
 - it might lead to interesting situations if the
   archive is opened by root, but accessed by an user
   (thinking of caches and such)
best,
