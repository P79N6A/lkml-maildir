I don't understand what you're asking.  If you're asking "will a case
with no break at the end exit the switch or fall through to the next
case?" the answer is it will fall through unless it's the last one.
Then it'll exit the switch.
Some consider this a dubious side of the C language.
It's considered dubious style to miss out the last break BTW.
For those times when people add new cases at the end.

I prefer it :-)
