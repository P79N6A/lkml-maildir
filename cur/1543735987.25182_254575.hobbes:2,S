Not all he wanted.  There's more to a patch than the diff.
The following three documents explain how to submit patches to the
Linux kernel:
 1) Documentation/SubmittingPatches, a file in the kernel source
 2) Andrew Morton's "The Perfect Patch", available at:
      
http://www.zip.com.au/~akpm/linux/patches/stuff/tpp.txt
 3) Jeff Garzik's "Linux kernel patch submission format", at:
      
http://linux.yyz.us/patch-format.html
