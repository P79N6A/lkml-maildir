I wrote about monster autorepeats not every single duplicated keypress.
I fully agree it's stupid to expect detecting every single bogus repeat.
However saying the system has no way to guess monster
autorepeats=problem is just plain wrong. There *are* thresholds after
which one can be 99% sure there is a problem (autorepeat gone mad or cat
sitting on the keyboard). No one is going to complain he has to release
a key every hundred or so repeats to confirm there's a human on the
other side of the keyboard.
