informational update.
---> drivers/block/Config.in
Add identical support for booting offboard PCI controllers as 2.1.X now
provides for in ide-pci.c
---> drivers/block/genhd.c
addition of heads == 240 prior to calling ide_xlate_1024 for bioses that
report this value as a LBA translation, and conform to the options that
are presented in 2.1.X kernels.
---> drivers/block/hd.c
correct for changes in ide.c for allowing the full 512 byte IDENTITY pointer
to be returned.
---> drivers/block/ide.c
Fix/Correct reporting geometry and capacity values as it relates to
"ATA/ATAPI-4 spec T13-1153D Revision 17 30-Oct-97" for properly handling
drives that are 8G and larger (or capacity >= 16,514,064).
Fix ioctl() ide.c for allowing the full 512 byte IDENTITY pointer to be
returned, as 2.1.X kernels allow while being backwards compatable.
Allow for reporting BIOSes that are (U)DMA capable if the bios is enabled to do
so correctly. Allow 'ide_xlate_1024' to correct 'drive->id->cur_CHS' values
in the drive data pointer maintained by the kernel so that all geometries
will match.  Enable auto-dection of new ide-chipsets via the 'ide_probe_pci'
function.
---> drivers/block/ide.h
Change promise PDC20246 detection to conform with calls to "triton" and
allow for a generic "udma_chipset".
---> drivers/block/triton.c
Add and update DMA blacklist and New chipsets to give backcoded support
from currently supported chipsets in 2.1.X.  Allow for the following config
option to be used 'CONFIG_BLK_DEV_OFFBOARD'. Correct event order for DMA
transfers as described in "ATA/ATAPI-4 spec T13-1153D Revision 17 30-Oct-97"
on Page 234 and Intel BM in 29055002.pdf section 7 on Page 99.

CONFIG_BLK_DEV_VIA82C586 informational update.
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_ALI15X3 informational update.

Intel PIIXn chipsets support (EXPERIMENTAL)	extention
ALI M15x3 chipset support (EXPERIMENTAL)	new
CY82C693 chipset support (EXPERIMENTAL)		new
PDC20246 chipset support (EXPERIMENTAL)		current-extention
Stub Out but Add:
HPT343 chipset support (EXPERIMENTAL)
---> drivers/block/Makefile
Add objects for compiling old () and new chipsets
---> drivers/block/PIIX.c
 *  Copyright (C) 1998 Andrzej Krzysztofowicz, Author and Maintainer
 *  PIO mode setting function for Intel chipsets.
 *  For use instead of BIOS settings.
---> drivers/block/aec6210.c
Allow for enableing bios on off-board chipset in the new 'pci_init_xxx'
function callout, formerly know as 'ide_special_settings' in 'ide-pci.c'.
---> drivers/block/alim15x3.c
 *  Copyright (C) 1998 Michel Aubry, Maintainer
 *  Copyright (C) 1998 Andrzej Krzysztofowicz, Maintainer
 *  (U)DMA capable version of ali 1533/1543(C)
Allow for preconfiguring the pci config space int new 'pci_init_xxx'
function callout, formerly know as 'ide_special_settings' in 'ide-pci.c'.
Since this chipset has such overhead in setting up functionality,
the addition of this callout was required to prevent bloating of
'ide-pci.c' anymore.
---> drivers/block/cmd646.c
Move DM's calls for setting up (U)DMA transfer rates for the drive
and chipset at boot time for general use by other chipsets as needed.
This code was moved to ide.c and ide.h and exported.
---> drivers/block/cy82c693.c
Andreas S. Krebs (akrebs@altavista.net), Maintainer
The CY82C693 chipset is used on Digital's PC-Alpha 164SX boards.
Writting the driver was quite simple, since most of the job is
done by the generic pci-ide support.
The hard part was finding the CY82C693's datasheet on Cypress's
web page :-(. But Altavista solved this problem :-).
---> drivers/block/ide-disk.c
Fix/Correct reporting geometry and capacity values as it relates to
"ATA/ATAPI-4 spec T13-1153D Revision 17 30-Oct-97" for properly handling
drives that are 8G and larger (or capacity >= 16,514,064).
Back out "fixed mult_count enables" per request of Alan Cox.
Allow "ide_add_setting" for 'drive->bios_cyl' to extend to 65535.
---> drivers/block/ide-dma.c
Add and update DMA blacklist and New chipsets to give backcoded support
from currently supported chipsets in 2.1.X.  Allow for the following config
option to be used 'CONFIG_BLK_DEV_OFFBOARD'. Correct event order for DMA
transfers as described in "ATA/ATAPI-4 spec T13-1153D Revision 17 30-Oct-97"
on Page 234 and Intel BM in 29055002.pdf section 7 on Page 99.
Allow for ALI IV and V chipsets to use dma transfers by test flagging and
setting  BM-DMA states for native use when reporting SIMPLEXITY.
---> drivers/block/ide-pci.c
Redo method of chipset initializations.
Since new mainboards require that one fuss with the controller proir to
init and drive setups, and several have special dynamic settings for
using dma-xfers, I have found it necessay to split this code off into
the respective chipsets to stop the bloating of 'ide-pci.c'.
---> drivers/block/ide-probe.c
Create create_proc_ide_interface if hwif->present for modular support.
---> drivers/block/ide-proc.c
Addition of procfs timing reports of VIA-(U)DMA and ALADDIN controllers.
Conform to changes set in the procfs updates for modularity.
---> drivers/block/ide.c
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_VIA82C586 options needs and an extern value to be
reported back to the chipset specific code at init time, if the user
chooses to define the size and limits of the fifo channels.
Addition of two functions 'ide_special_set_xfer_mode' and 'wait_for_ready' a
support function to wait for the drive during speed/xfer_rate programming at
init time.
Allow for consitance in hd_setup calls to the kernel, "swapdata or bswap"
to be identical to the contents of the procfs info in the settings file
for each ide device.
Allow 'ide_xlate_1024' to correct 'drive->id->cur_CHS' values in the
drive data pointer maintained by the kernel so that all geometries will match.
Addition of 'ide_mod_ref_change_proc' for modularity of procfs.
---> drivers/block/ide.h
Add another chipset 'ide_cy82c693', and procfs modular capabilties.
Add defines of now shared information form cmd646.c source and
new function for 'ide_special_set_xfer_mode'.
---> drivers/block/ide_modes.h
Additional drive info for PIO blacklists.
Allow more chipsets to use PIO tuneproc functions.
---> drivers/block/pdc20246.c
Allow for enableing bios on off-board chipset in the new 'pci_init_xxx'
function callout, formerly know as 'ide_special_settings' in 'ide-pci.c'.
Allows for chipset speed tuning when using two or more controller of this
type.  Note that bios support from promise only allows for the first 8
ide-disk drives to be supported up to UDMA2.  The third controller
is limited to Multi-word DMA mode 2 with this new code.  This 
appears to be hard bios hardware limit of the cards.
---> drivers/block/via82c586.c
Add The TX Pro III is also reported OK with UDMA support, and procfs
timing reports with user configurablity of the splitfifo channels
as it relates to dma transfers.  Also allow for special dma tunings
with a dma_init callout function from 'ide-pci.c'.
---> include/linux/hdreg.h
Begin update/conversion to ATA-4 standard.
Begin additions for security settings on removable devices.
---> init/main.c
Allow for "splitfifo" commands to be passed to the IDE-Driver at boot
for setting up the dual fifo channel buffers of the VIA-IDE chipsets.
---> fs/proc/generic.c
---> fs/proc/inode.c
---> fs/proc/procfs_syms.c
---> include/linux/proc_fs.h
Correctly follow downward links in creating and deleting files in the
'/proc' directory as it relates to the IDE driver being created and loaded
as a module and unloaded.  This should be uniform for all other modules that
have multiple directories and files created and deleted.
This should prevent future procfs problems when modules are unloaded, as not
to leave dangling files there.  This could and would result in the inablity
of reloading a module at a later time.
Correct reported procfs security holes that are separate from the IDE issues.
