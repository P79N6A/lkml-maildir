Hi Nick
There is no numbers for sure now, it is just instability.
I am bisecting kernel now (from 2.6.21 to 2.6.22-rc1), i think it is caused 
by some patch, and maybe not related to CFS. Anyways, let's see when i finish 
bisect. Just i was thinking, maybe anyone else have similar issues or some 
ideas in mind.
The only one case - it is very difficult to track, and i have to do it on 
live server with thousands of users. At night load is much lower, so possible 
by mistake i will miss a point (it can detect bug easily, IF softirq in 
mpstat 1 will jump up to 30+%. On 2.6.21 it is always staying +-10%, on 
"buggy" version it jumps up to 100%. Now cause less load at night up to 30-
50%, so on hardware it is not very noticeable (thats why maybe not much 
feedbacks), i am trying to utilise hardware maximum as possible - so i feel 
regressions much more.
Anyway, possible i will have news after 2-3 hours max.
