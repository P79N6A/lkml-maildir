Yes. You can't use memory node partitioning for file pages in this way
unless you have strict controls over who can access the data sets in
question, and are careful to prevent people from moving between
containers. So it's not suitable for all uses of resource-isolating
containers.
Who is to say that the pages allocated in (2) *should* be reaccounted
to my_container2 after (3)? Some people might want that, other
(including me) might not.
