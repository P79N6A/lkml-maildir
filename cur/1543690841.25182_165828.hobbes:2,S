s/ATA/SATA/
ATA and SATA will still need their own driver(s) aware of driver-model,
sysfs, ATA quirks/tuning etc.  I am working on this part currently, so you can
concentrate on new, sexy SATA, leaving all dirty, legacy ATA for me.
For all other stuff described in your mail I can only say: HELL YEAH!.
