First of all:
I 100% agree with Andrew that our biggest problems are in reviewing code 
and resolving bugs, not in finding bugs (we already have far too many 
unresolved bugs).
But although testing mustn't replace code reviews it is a great help, 
especially for identifying regressions early.
Finding testers should actually be relatively easy since it doesn't 
require much knowledge from the testers.
And it could even solve a second problem:
It could be a way for getting newbies into kernel development.
We actually do only rarely have tasks suitable as janitor tasks for 
newbies, and the results of people who do neither know the kernel
nor know C running checkpatch on files in the kernel have already
been discussed extensively...
I'll try to do this:
- create some Wiki page
- get a mailing list at vger
- point newbies to this mailing list
- tell people there which kernels to test
- figure out and document stuff like how to bisect between -next kernels
- help them to do whatever is required for a proper bug report
