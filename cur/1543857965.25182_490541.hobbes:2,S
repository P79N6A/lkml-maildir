Subject: [PATCH] Fix crossbuilding checkstack
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/12/11/259

The previous checkstack fix for UML, which needs to use the host's tools, 
was wrong in the crossbuilding case.  It would use the build host's,
rather than the target's, toolchain.
This patch removes the old fix and adds an explicit special case for UML, 
leaving everyone else alone.
