Ah, now you are arguing semantics. When somebody writes
something to improve the Linux kernel this makes them
part of the Linux kernel community. The project might
be a new file system or a tool to verify the consistency
of certain rules. The CHECKER people set out to make a 
tool that finds potential bugs in the Linux kernel.
That they did. "All bugs are shallow" means, that once a
potential bug is identified, it will be resolved very quickly.
This happened with the CHECKER reports. False positives
were immediately identified as such, real bugs were fixed
almost in real time. Where did you see the scheme breaking
down? 
Because the bugs should have been found without the tool?
Nobody ever claimed the Linux kernel was bug free. The 
CHECKER people found some of the bugs still in the kernel.
Without a comparison one cannot assess whether the bug rate
was higher or lower than the average in complex software
systems. 
My impression is, that most of the bugs identified where in
well contained subsystems, e.g. drivers or individual file
systems. These subsystems are somewhat special. Though they
are part of the kernel tree, most are only of interest for a
subset of all Linux users. That's why they tend to get less
testing and less eye balls. BTW, MS claims that the same is 
true for Windows. Most bugs are said to be in external drivers.
So, overall I think your arguments are flawed.
