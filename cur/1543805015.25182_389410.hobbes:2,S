Quoting David Brownell (david-b@pacbell.net):

That I am doing. And I now have the appropriate OHCI module
loaded. USB 1.1 works apparently quite OK. 
> Or, the attached patch might help.  
I applied the patch. The three changes to the second file applied with
an offset of 6 lines (to 2.6.15 vanilla). Nothing changed: the booting
process hung at the same place, generating the same printout as
before. I have now booted the new kernel with EHCI disabled, and saved
the dmesg oputput to 
http://www.fluido.as/files/dmesg2.txt
 (here,
USB1.1 is active).
It is time for sleep for me. I will perform any new test tomorrow
morning.
