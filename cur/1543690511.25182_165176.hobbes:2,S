Hi,
http://www.kerneltrap.org/~npiggin/v15/
This was going to get high res timers, but instead fixed a bug that might
be causing a few people oopses. Also very small interactivity tweaks.
I'm starting to work on SMP and NUMA ideas now, so if any interactivity
things are bothering you, please tell me soon. I should be getting access
to a 32-way NUMA soon, so I'm sort of holding off chaning too much until
then.
Enjoy.
