Well it seems that we have to rely on mmap_sem otherwise concurrent faults 
can occur. The mmap_sem seems to be acquired for write there.
              if (!has_write_lock) {
                        up_read(&mm->mmap_sem);
                        down_write(&mm->mmap_sem);
                        has_write_lock = 1;
                        goto retry;
                }

So "pins" means a reference count right? I still do not get why you 
have refcount problems. You take a refcount when you export the page 
through KVM and then drop the refcount in invalidate page right?
So you walk through the KVM ptes and drop the refcount for each spte you 
encounter?
