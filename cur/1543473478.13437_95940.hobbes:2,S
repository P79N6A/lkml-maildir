Great!
Alan, you may wish to consider using the new EXTRAVERSION variable
Linus has put into the top-level Makefile in your patches to reflect
the -ac2 (or whatever you're on by the time this is sent ;) in the
version.
Right now, EXTRAVERSION in 2.2.0-pre1 is set to:
VERSION = 2
PATCHLEVEL = 2
SUBLEVEL = 0
EXTRAVERSION =-pre1
but this could easily become:
VERSION = 2
PATCHLEVEL = 2
SUBLEVEL = 0
EXTRAVERSION =-pre1-ac2
or whatever you need. What do you think? This would make my life
easier keeping track of what patches I've applied.. or is there a
better place that this kind of stuff is recorded into via the -ac
patches?
Ben
