Yes, that works.  Now I've found a bug in the ZIP drivers:
imm.c: In function `imm_detect':
imm.c:169: `PARPORT_MODE_PCPS2' undeclared (first use in this function)
imm.c:169: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
imm.c:169: for each function it appears in.)
imm.c:172: `PARPORT_MODE_PCECPPS2' undeclared (first use in this function)
imm.c:176: `PARPORT_MODE_PCECPEPP' undeclared (first use in this function)
