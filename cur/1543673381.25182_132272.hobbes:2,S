Fundamental rule of software reliability/simplicity.  Build one basket
and put all of your eggs in it.
I guess I can't possibly imagine why after a system halt anyone
would want random cpus scurrying around.  So this forces the issues
up to the from so they can be examined and fixed.
If the code is wrong from NUMA-Q I would like to get a correct version.
