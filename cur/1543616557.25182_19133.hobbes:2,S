   I accidently destroyed the Kernel of my self made bridge (old 486 / 4 PCI 
   nics).
   When i tried to compile an new one (2.4.17) I've got a compile error in
   include/net/tcp_ecn.h
   Is this patch suitable or could you tell me why unix sokets
   and others need tcp.h ? 
It is better to conditionalize or remove the include than to add
CONFIG_INET ifdefs to a TCP header :-)
I thought I had fixed this in current kernels...
