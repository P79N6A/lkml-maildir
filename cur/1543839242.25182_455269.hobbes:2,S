I guess one of my big questions surrounding these patches is why the
accounting is done with pages.  If there really is a need to limit these
different kernel objects, then why not simply write patches to limit
*these* *objects*?  I trust there is a very good technical reason for
doing this, I just don't understand why, yet.
