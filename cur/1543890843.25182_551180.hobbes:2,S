Sure. I think there are things we can do (like make the non-linear fd's 
appear somewhere else, and make them close-on-exec by default etc).
And it's not like it's necessarily at all the only way to do things. 
I just threw it out as a possible solution - and one that is almost 
certainly *superior* to trying to work around the fd thing with some 
shared memory area which has tons of much more serious problems of its own 
(*).

(*) Ranging from: specialized-only interfaces, inability to pass it 
around, lack of any abstraction interfaces, and almost impossible to 
debug. The security implications of kernel and user space sharing 
read-write access to some shared area are also legion!
