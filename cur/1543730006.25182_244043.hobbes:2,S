| Thanks. That worked perfectly. Who is the responsible maintainer for

Post the patch here for other comments/review & copy it to akpm@osdl.org
(Andrew Morton).
He will likely merge it into the -mm patchset for a while to see if it
makes anything else unhappy.  If not, and if noone has problems with it
(e.g., on other kinds of x86 motherboards), then it should be
merged, but that's up to Andrew and/or Linus.
