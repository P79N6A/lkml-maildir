When we are very low on memory and do access the reserves by means of
ALLOC_NO_WATERMARKS, we want to avoid processed that are not entitled to
use such memory from running away with the little we have.
That is the whole and only point; restrict memory allocated under
ALLOC_NO_WATERMARKS to those processes that are entitled to it.
