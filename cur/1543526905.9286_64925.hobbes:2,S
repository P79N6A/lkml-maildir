No, I was talking about 
http://uzix.org/cscope.html,
 but then the
disk that it was on died on me... and the backup I have of my
little web area didn't have cscope.html ... that file is now there
again, so you can see what I wrote.
Not that it matters though... I've started on an open source cscope,
and the inital release will be in the near future.
