It's not process specific data.  It is a pointer to global context in
which uid's on the filesystem uniquely specify a user.  This is
something that would get set when the filesystem is mounted.

Now I do agree if I can set the information in vfsmount and not in
the superblock it is probably better.  But even with nfs mount superblock
collapsing (which I almost understand) I don't see it as a real
problem, as long as I could prevent the superblock from collapsing.
