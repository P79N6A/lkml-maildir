If you see _R__ver_ instead of _R_xxxxxxxx_ in a kernel symbol then it
is 99.99% certain that you have been bitten by the broken Makefiles.
Current Makefiles do not correctly recalculate the checksums under all
circumstances, especially when new symbols are added.  It will probably
not be fixed before 2.5, in the meantime
  mv .config ..
  make mrproper (clean is not enough)
  mv ../.config .
  make oldconfig
  make dep clean bzImage modules
