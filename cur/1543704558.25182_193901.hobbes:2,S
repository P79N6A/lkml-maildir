   Anyway, here's the fixed version.
Applied, thanks.  This one might have to wait for 2.6.3-pre1 though
for merging.
   The 2.4 backport will come next week hopefully when I'll walk
   through all my pending 2.4 stuffs, I want to dbl check a few things
   in it first (and I'm not yet 100% certain I will merge the G5
   support in 2.4 upstream anyway).
You should be able to literally copy the 2.6.x driver into the 2.4.x
tree with perhaps only a one liner or two (if that).
   the new PCI ID isn't yet in Linus tree, but it's in the patches
   I'm currently sending to Andrew.
I'd prefer in the future you not do it this way, just give it
instead within the driver update so that you patch by itself
stands alone.
Thanks.
