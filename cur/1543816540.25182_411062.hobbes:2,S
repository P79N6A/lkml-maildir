It is nothing to do with DMA. See the postings in 2004 on the subject.
EOF handling in the block layer and IDE layer don't work for the case
where the size of a block device is not precisely defined
None fo the current block layer maintainers care about fixing it and
nobody else has submitted changes. Feel free to do that.
Fortunately the drivers/ide layer will hopefully be going away soon
