Hi,
I am occasionally seeing some rather odd errors while loading audio
CD-ROMs. The following is output from my kernel log:
Dec 11 20:52:59 WellHouse kernel: hdc: packet command error: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }

This is happening when I am loading a new disk into the drive while
running xmcd-2.4. I have looked through the xmcd code and it looks
fairly innocent. This is the DEBUG output from xmcd while the kernel
errors are being written:
Open: /dev/cdrom
IOCTL: CDROM_DRIVE_STATUS arg=0x7fffffff ret=2
CDROM_DRIVE_STATUS return=0x2
IOCTL: CDROM_DRIVE_STATUS arg=0x7fffffff ret=3
CDROM_DRIVE_STATUS return=0x3
IOCTL: CDROM_DRIVE_STATUS arg=0x7fffffff ret=3
CDROM_DRIVE_STATUS return=0x3
Disc not ready.
Close: /dev/cdrom
Open of /dev/cdrom failed
Open: /dev/cdrom
IOCTL: CDROM_DRIVE_STATUS arg=0x7fffffff ret=3
CDROM_DRIVE_STATUS return=0x3
IOCTL: CDROM_DRIVE_STATUS arg=0x7fffffff ret=3
CDROM_DRIVE_STATUS return=0x3
IOCTL: CDROM_DRIVE_STATUS arg=0x7fffffff ret=3
CDROM_DRIVE_STATUS return=0x3
Disc not ready.
Close: /dev/cdrom
And here is the corresponding code (slioc_send() is basically a wrapper
around ioctl() which returns 0 if the ioctl returns -1, and 1 otherwise):
--- extract from slioc_disc_present()
#ifdef linux
    /* Use new method to get drive status */
    if (slioc_send(CDROM_DRIVE_STATUS, (void *) CDSL_CURRENT, 0,
               app_data.debug, &ret)) {
        DBGPRN(errfp, "CDROM_DRIVE_STATUS return=0x%x\n", ret);
        switch (ret) {
        case CDS_DISC_OK:
            return TRUE;
        case CDS_NO_DISC:
        case CDS_TRAY_OPEN:
        case CDS_DRIVE_NOT_READY:
            return FALSE;
        case CDS_NO_INFO:
            break;
        default:
            return FALSE;
        }
    }
    /* CDROM_DRIVE_STATUS failed: try the old way */
#endif
--- and slioc_disc_present() is called from:
        /* Linux hack:  The CD-ROM driver allows the open to succeed
         * even if there is no CD loaded.  We test for the existence of
         * a disc with slioc_disc_present().
         */
        for (i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
                if ((ret = slioc_disc_present(FALSE)) == TRUE)
                        break;
        }
        if (ret == FALSE) {
                DBGPRN(errfp, "%s\n\nClose: %s\n",
                        "Disc not ready.", s->curdev);
                slioc_close();
                return FALSE;
        }
So all xmcd seems to be doing is polling the CDROM with the
CDROM_DRIVE_STATUS ioctl, waiting for me to put a disk in. The CD in
question has a video track at the end of it, which might also be
significant; I don't recall seeing this error before buying audio CDs
with "bonus" video / data tracks.
According to /proc, my cdrom is:
$ cat /proc/ide/hdc/model
TOSHIBA CD-ROM XM-6002B
$ cat /proc/ide/hdc/driver  
ide-cdrom version 4.54
# cat /proc/ide/hdc/settings

One final observation (although with too few statistics for me to be
sure of its significance) - the kernel errors seem to be produced when
I close the drive's tray by pushing the button on the front, rather
than by issuing a software request. When I use the ioctl, I tend to
see this error in /var/log/kernel, but the disc is successfully
recognised:
Dec 11 21:47:23 WellHouse kernel: hdc: irq timeout: status=0xd0 { Busy } 
Dec 11 21:47:23 WellHouse kernel: hdc: ATAPI reset complete
I hope I've included enough information here for someone to have an
idea what and where the problem might be,
Cheers,
Chris.
