Anyway, with print-fatal-signals enabled a user could spam syslogd too, simply
with a (char *)0 = 0 program, but we could always identify the spam attempts
logging the process uid...
In any case, I agree, it should depend on that patch...
What about adding a simple msleep_interruptible(SOME_MSECS) at the end of
log_vm_enomem() or, at least, a might_sleep() to limit the potential spam/second
rate?
