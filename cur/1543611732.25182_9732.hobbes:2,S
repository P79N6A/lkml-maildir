I verified this by throwing in 1GB of swap. It does lose the buffers 
eventually, but it does so under great pains. However, since I do have 
*plenty* memory and slow disks, I prefer running without swap. These settings 
appear to be broken (2.4.13 worked!).
Without swap, I would have to reboot every day to make my simulation happy.- 
But it needs to allocate and use *only* about 300 of 768MB which *should* be 
available, only because the night before a cron job kicked off 'updatdb' 
filling the buffers.
Without swap, it really is *this* bad in 2.4.16 and the latest pre-releases. 
RAM is full of buffers that just won't disappear to make room for more 
important stuff. My simulation gets killed *every time* until I reboot to 
free 'buffers' or add swap. (This makes everything slower in total.)
