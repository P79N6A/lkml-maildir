I also decided that the suggestion to move the "testing" subdirectory down
to below the kernel that the directory is for is a good idea.
So I moved all the 2.5.x testing stuff to kernel/v2.5/testing, leaving the
old kernel/testing directory basically orphaned.
Marcelo could either take over the old directory (which will make his
pre-patches show up on kernel.org automatically), or preferably just do
the same thing, and make the v2.4 test patches in v2.4/testing (which will
also require support from the site admin, who is probably overworked as-is
with the RAID failures ;)
