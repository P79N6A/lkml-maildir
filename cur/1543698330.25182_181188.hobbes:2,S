Well, we're trying, but nobody has had a lot of luck with it.
However, your particular case looks pretty straightforward:

Somebody jumped through a NULL pointer, and it was:

That's the code that does:
	...
        if (test_bit (PC_DMA_OK, &pc->flags)) {
                set_bit (PC_DMA_IN_PROGRESS, &pc->flags);
                (void) (HWIF(drive)->ide_dma_begin(drive));
        }
	...
and it looks like the PC_DMA_OK flag is incorrect.
Doing a bit more digging shows that "idescsi_issue_pc()" seems to use some
variables without ever actually _initializing_ them. How about this
trivial one-liner? Does that make it work for you?
Jens? Comments?
