Sounds good, Paul.  I think the discussion on this thread was kind of
winding down anyway.  In two weeks I'll have some more work done on my
code, particularly trying to get the cpusets/CKRM filesystem interface
to play with my sched_domains code.  We'll be able to digest all the the
information, requirements, requests, etc. on this thread and start a
fresh discussion on (or at least closer to) the same page.
