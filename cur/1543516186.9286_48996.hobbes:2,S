Hi,
Just to clarify:
whether ramdisk is compressed or not, it is irrelevant - in both cases,
it will load ok but as soon as you do do_load_elf_binary() it will fail
the ELF magic test - in fact all data is zeros, which is why if you enable
CONFIG_KMOD it will request_module(binfmt-0000) which will try to exec
/sbin/modprobe which will request_module(binfmt-0000) etc etc.
Any ideas why? This is in
addition to zeropage being corrupted which I "worked around" by not using
so much stuff in command_line[] - reduced to absolute minimum (e.g. let
mem to be (wrongly) autodetected because this usually causes corruptions
much much (2 minutes) later).
Regards,
Tigran.
