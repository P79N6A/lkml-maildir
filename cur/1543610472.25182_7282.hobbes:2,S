It's a normal shutdown, every filesystem is unmounted cleanly, no
complains from the os.

There are a few processes running: news, something called minilgd.Even 
with these programs running lsof shows no output. If I kill these 
programs and make a normal shutdown, it loocked much better. Only a 
complain about the keyboard lock.
If I acted exactly like your advise, there is no problem with the restart.
The processes running in 2.4.15 single user mode are exactly the same as 
in 2.4.14.
