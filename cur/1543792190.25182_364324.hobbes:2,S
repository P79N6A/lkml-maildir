Works fine for me. Thank you!
However I noticed another recursive call while dumping all call traces:
 ...
 [<00000000001e1952>] zfcp_scsi_command_async+0xf6/0x1c4
 [<000000000013cd6a>] scsi_dispatch_cmd+0x1ae/0x37c

 [<000000000017e598>] dm_unplug_all+0x2c/0x44
 [<00000000000782aa>] block_sync_page+0x4e/0x68
 [<00000000000514f8>] sync_page+0x48/0x68
 [<00000000002ab36e>] __wait_on_bit+0x9a/0xe0
 ...
Even though there is a lot of space left on the stack (this time) I don't
think it's desirable to have recursive calls. Especially not when going
for 4k stacks.
