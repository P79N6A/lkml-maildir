Thanks for everyone answered.
The problem is resolved - one DDR2 module is bad now.
One month ago it survived overnight memtest run,
but now it is definitely bad. memtest detects problems
in a few seconds.

I found info about such mobos and preliminary analysis said
to indicate that one of mobo capacitors had wrong specs.
MSI said to start replacing affected mobos.
My mobo serial number doesn't seem to fall into range of
affected ones, but entire affair doesn't sound encouraging at all.
Not to mention that BIOS is somewhat more buggy that I expected, too.
