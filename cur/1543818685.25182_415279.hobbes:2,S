Which is fine because sched_compute isn't designed for heavily multithreaded 
usage.

Oh that's good because staircase14.2_test3 is basically staircase15 which is 
in the current plugsched (ie newer than the staircase you tested in 
plugsched-2.6.16 above). So it tolerates a load of up to 500 on single cpu? 
That seems very robust to me.

Oh no it's nothing like "tuned for single-user multi tasking". It seems a 
common misconception because interactivity is a prime concern for staircase 
but the idea is that we should be able to do interactivity without 
sacrificing fairness. The same mechanism that is responsible for maintaining 
fairness is also responsible for creating its interactivity. That's what I 
mean by "interactive by design", and what makes it different from extracting 
interactivity out of other designs that have some form of estimator to add 
unfairness to create that interactivity.

I know you're _very_ keen on the idea of some autotuning but I think this is 
the wrong thing to autotune. The whole point of staircase is it's a simple 
design without any interactivity estimator. It uses pure cpu accounting to 
change priority and that is a percentage which is effectively already tuned 
to the underlying cpu. Any benchmarking/aggressiveness "tuning" would undo 
the (effectively) very simple design. 
Feel free to look at the code. Sleep for time Y, increase priority by 
Y/RR_INTERVAL. Run for time X, drop priority by X/RR_INTERVAL. If it drops to 
lowest priority it then jumps back up to best priority again (to prevent it 
being "batch starved").
Thanks very much for testing :)
