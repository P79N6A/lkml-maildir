This is disturbing. I suspect this is only going to raise poor memory
utilization issues on highmem boxen. Of course, "f**k highmem" is such
a common refrain these days so that's probably falling on deaf ears.
AFAICT the OOM issues are largely a by-product of mempool allocations
entering out_of_memory() when they have the perfectly reasonable
alternative strategy of simply waiting for the mempool to refill.
Cheers,
Bill
