Thanks to Keiths tip, I got things going. I put everything back into the
Linux src tree and did a make modules (after some twiddling). When that
worked, I just took note of the compile options and brought them back out to
my stand-alone source tree. It built and insmod'ed just fine. Now I'm having
difficulties building my driver with RedHat. The running kernel is labelled
as
	2.2.5-15smp
My built module (as with other modules after the make modules) has been
tagged with 2.2.5-15. When I try insmod'ing with -f (to force it) I get
unresolved symbols of the variety
	unresolved symbol printk_R1b7d4074
cat /proc/ksyms reveals:
	c0115534 printk_Rsmp_1b7d4074
For some reason the smp_ is not being prefixed when I make modules. I can
see in the /usr/src/linux/Rules.make that genksyms is run with -p smp_ but
that does not seem to be 'kicking in'.
It's the same if I try any other newly built module (e.g. slhc). After
-f'ing the insmod I get unresolved symbols.
Here's what options are being used when compiling my source code:
	gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/usr/src/linux-2.2.5/include -Wall
-Wstrict-prototypes -O2 
	-fomit-frame-pointer -D__SMP__ -pipe -fno-strength-reduce -m386
-DCPU=386 -DMODULE
	 -DMODVERSIONS -include
/usr/src/linux-2.2.5/include/linux/modversions.h  ...
Anyone?
