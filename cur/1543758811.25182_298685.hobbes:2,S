I think this statement proves that the current development situation is
working quite well.  The nasty breakage and details got worked out in
the -mm tree, and then flowed into your tree when they seemed sane.

So, any driver stuff is just fine?  Great, I don't have an issue with
your proposal then, as it wouldn't affect me that much :)
I do understand what you are trying to achieve here, people don't really
test the -rc releases as much as a "real" 2.6.11 release.  Getting a
week of testing and bugfix only type patches to then release a 2.6.12
makes a lot of sense.  For example, see all of the bug reports that came
out of the woodwork today on lkml from the 2.6.11 release...
But accepting 310 netdev patches, 250 USB, 50 PCI, 50 I2c, and 100 ALSA
patches in one week and expect the tree to stay "stable" might be a
pretty unreasonable thing to wish for...
thanks,
