Are you sure these are the latest bit-sparse primes ?

Yuck, the fact that you're defining the exact same constant in
many .h files is ugly.  Could you move this to one place ?
(maybe linux/hash.h like Rusty is doing for 2.5?)

For 64-bit systems you'll want:
1) a 64-bit golden ratio prime
2) expanding the bit ops by hand because gcc doesn't do
   it for you
These last 2 points are easy, you can just copy the stuff
from the struct page patch I sent earlier.
cheers,
Rik
