The problem also goes away after unsetting ECHO on the slave terminal.
This seems to point to this code in n_tty_receive_char():
	if (L_ECHO(tty)) {
		if (tty->read_cnt >= N_TTY_BUF_SIZE-1) {
			put_char('\a', tty); /* beep if no space */
			return;
		}
	.......
	}
This code sets the maximum number of buffered characters to
N_TTY_BUF_SIZE-1, however, put_tty_queue() considers the maximum to be
N_TTY_BUF_SIZE, and n_tty_receive_room() also returns N_TTY_BUF_SIZE for
canonical mode if the canon_data buffer is empty - therefore after
unsetting ECHO bytes are no longer lost.
BTW, for the noncanonical mode n_tty_receive_room() calculates the
result assuming that the buffer can hold at most N_TTY_BUF_SIZE-1
characters - not the full N_TTY_BUF_SIZE.
