First off, realize that the problem actually happens during 
suspend-to-ram.
Think about that for a second.
In fact, think about it for a _loong_ time. Because dammit, people seem to

	There is no "atomic copy".
	There is no "checkpointing".
	There is no "spoon".

Hope _the_above_ helps. Why is it so hard for people to accept that 
suspend-to-ram shouldn't break because of some IDIOTIC issues with disk
