I think I must have said free when I meant clean, and this naturally 
confused you.
writepage() cleans pages, which is sometimes necessary for freeing them, 
but it does not free them itself.  
The one place where we would free them is when we repack slums before 
writing them.  In this case, an empty node is not going to get accessed 
again, so it should be freed.
