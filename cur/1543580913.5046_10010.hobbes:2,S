Subject: Odd behaviour on / filesystem and SCSI removable media

Hi,
I noticed an odd thing about my / file system:
du -hx reports 74mb used
df -h . reports 236mb used
The same behaviour does not show on other mounted filesystems... I'm not
sure which to believe...
I've seen this with 2.4.1 and 2.4.1-ac1, the filesystem is ReiserFS and
the kernel was compiled with egcs-1.1.2 (egcs-2.91.66).
Also, I've seen some interesting behaviour with an Iomega Jaz drive.
Basically, if I boot without a disk in the drive, the device is listed
as 1gb assumed so that when I insert a 2gb disk in the drive, it gets
messed up, unable to read the partition table. Same behaviour with the
Zip drive, picked up as a default 1gb (no Zip disk I'm aware of is this
large!) and can't deal with a 100 mb disk. Makes disk swapping with
removable media rather clunky since modules need to be removed and
reloaded to detect properly.
