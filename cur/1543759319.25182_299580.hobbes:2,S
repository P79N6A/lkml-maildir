Or to put it more simply:
The people we want testing these kernels have been trained to expect 
certain things from a Release Candidate.
These people don't have time to read LKML and understand Linus's 
deviation from the norm.
Therefore, if you want them to test, follow their expectations.
As I said...  it's a human not technical issue.
