I have been thinking about this in more detail. In a sense oldconfig does do
stuff you dont see and can cause suprises but its better than 'fix it yourself

If that aspect of it worries you collect a list of the symbols that were 
changed by the oldconfig process and colour them differently and/or offer
a view of them as part of the navigation
