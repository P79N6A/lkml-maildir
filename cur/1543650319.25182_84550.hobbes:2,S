yes, this fixes it.
Alan:
You did already include my patch into -ac. Please remove my patch to
include/net/irda/vlsi_ir.h from -ac and include Martin's patch (at the
bottom of this mail) instead.

You are right, this was surrounded by so much comment that I assumed it

Unfortunately the file compiled with a "implicit declaration of function
