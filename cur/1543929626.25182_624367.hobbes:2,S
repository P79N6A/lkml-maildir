Unfortunately, looking closer at the code, arg3 _is_ used. arg3 is used to
set a flag whether or not the mmap_sem is shared.
(I blame lack of food for not noticing this in the first place).

Since arg3 is out, which do you prefer? Creating an arg4 (and perhaps
more) in the block or having a u64 arg?  Changing all the args to u64 may
be the best. This way we don't need to worry about passing 64bit
arguments, and we don't waste more space on 64 bit archs by adding more
args of unsigned long.
Thoughts?
