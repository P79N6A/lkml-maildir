I agree.

True. I'm just not sure what is causing the bouncing - I guess
->f_count due to get_file()?
rw_verify_area is another that is taking a lot of hits - probably
due to the same cacheline(s) as update_atime.
Unless I'm mistaken, the big difference between the read fault and
the read(2) cases is that mmap holds a reference on the file, while
open(2) doesn't?
I guess if anyone really cares about that, they could hack up a flag
to tell the file to remain pinned.
