My mail program (netscape) (when so configured) automatically wraps 
lines (at a specified width - I use 72) for me by inserting new line 
characters when it sends the message.  It also wraps lines while I'm 
editing but without the new line characters so that when I delete some 
characters or insert some new ones in the middle of a paragraph I don't 
have to reformat the paragraph. I like this feature and assume that any 
reasonably modern mail program provides the same feature.  So what's all 
the fuss about?
