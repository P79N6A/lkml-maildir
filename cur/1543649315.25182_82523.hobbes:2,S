        It seems that some config breakage have sneaked past the people in
 position due to the fact little people use 386-powered boxens nowadays ;)
        The result being a menuconfig selection of 386 cpu in 2.4.20-pre9
 producing a .config with a CONFIG_X86_ENABLE_TSC (or was it _USE_TSC?).
  2.4.19-rc1 which i`ve ran before has no problem with it.
        I`ve built the kernel without looking at the resulting .config
 and then i was able to admit that my 386 somehow lacks "the TSC feature"
