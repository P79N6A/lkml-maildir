I cannot agree with you.
In order to consider an L1 I-cache entry as valid, a corresponding
virtual -> physic address translation should be valid in one of the L1 ITLBs.
"See 6.1.1. Instruction TLBS" of the I2 Proc. Ref. Man. for SW Dev. & Opt.
You cannot have a valid L1 ITLB entry unless you have a corresponding valid
L2 ITLB entry.
When you remove a PTE (or switch off the exec bit) and you flush the L2 ITLB
matching the old translation (and you kill the corresponding L1 ITLBs),
you do invalidate the corresponding L1 I-cache entries.
Therefore CPU models without split L2 caches are safe.
Thanks,
Zoltan
