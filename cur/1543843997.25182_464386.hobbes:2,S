So you think we should ignore CAP.NP and instead set our n_ports to the
position of the left-most 1-bit in PI? That would break in your case of
PI containing invalid data.
I do think a mapping is the way to go, but the implementation can
perhaps be improved a little - so that the table is local to the
probing, and is not used thereafter - because the data is stored in the
ata_ports->private_data instead.
For my hardware, note that CAP.NP was 4, and PI was (binary) 110011. By
my reading of the spec, this is correct - and says there are 4 usable
ports, located at addresses 0, 1, 4, 5.
Looking at the motherboard more closely, I do find two other unpopulated
SATA headers (also lacking the various electrical bits, so not trivial
to hack on).
