  Hi, all. Version 176 of my devfs patch is now available from:
http://www.atnf.csiro.au/~rgooch/linux/kernel-patches.html
The devfs FAQ is also available here.
This work has been sponsored by SGI.
Patch directly available from:

This is against 2.4.0-test3-pre4. Highlights of this release:
- Updated ToDo list
- Removed sample modules.conf: now distributed with devfsd
- Updated README from master HTML file
- Ported to kernel 2.4.0-test3-pre4 (which had devfs-patch-v174)
