   This packet is never ACK'd by www.sun.com and the only difference I
   can see from one that is are these two bits. RFC793 says they must be zero.
   Is 793 still current? Has anyone else seen this?
ECN, RFC2481
Turn it off with /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_ecn or tell Sun to update the
software running on their firewall.
Later,
