Hi
I have next strange problem: i installed to my machine ald SB16 card. Recompiled
kernel(2.2.12) with sound support and loaded sb.o with some parameters. All works
fine, but after ~2 minutes of SB inactivity i can hear click in speakers(like SB is initializing)
and after this i can't play sound because i got next error:
DMA(output) timed out-IRQ/DRQ config errror
But if i make 'rmmod sb' and then 'modprobe sb' it works again. I seems to me
that this is wrong. Where is the problem?
Kernel version:2.2.12
SB: Creative SoundBlaster 16
