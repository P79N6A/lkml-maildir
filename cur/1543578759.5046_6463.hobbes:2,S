Sorry, my fingers slipped and I sent the mail too fast :(
Trying to compile 2.4.0-ac8 resulted in an error about
storage size of variable d not being known (I don't have the
exact error at hand, the network connectivity to that server
is down right now). Changing it to dqblk32 got it to compile.
Am I doing something else wrong ?
