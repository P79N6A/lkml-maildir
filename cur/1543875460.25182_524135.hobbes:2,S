It breaks the ia64 build:
ima_fs_cleanup: discarded in section `.exit.text' from security/built-in.o
it's calling an __exit function from a non-_-exit function.
I'll remove the __exit tag from ima_fs_cleanup(), but that's the wrong fix
- really the caller should be fixed but it's all tangled up in a quite
unnecessary inlined function.
I must say that this code doesn't leave an impression of having sufficient
overall quality.  It needs some caring for.
