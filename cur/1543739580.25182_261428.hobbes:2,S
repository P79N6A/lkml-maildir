Hi,
    I changed my GeForce FX 5200 128MB to  another GeForce FX5200 but 
with 256MB of memory, and something had been wrong. At boot, framebuffer 
return a error:
    vesafb: probe of vesafb0 failed with error -6
I found another one with same error.
The old card was AGP revision 2.0, this new card is AGP revision 3.0.
Is framebuffer incompatible with this review?
Regards,
    Olavo.
