First let me say thanks all I got the answer to my ppp problem.
Second I am not sure if this has been suggested before or tried, but
wouldn't it be a good idea to make the kernel archives keyword
searchable?  Rather than trying to look month by month week by week, one
could enter in a search string like ppp and blam all the messages
related to ppp would be returned.  Maybe set up a bugzilla type
interface, that can sort messages and maintain a database.
People like me who are not suscribed to the list coudl search it and
then if there is not an issue in there already it can then get entered.
It may help lighten the load on the help allievate repeated issues.
Or is this implemented already somewhere an I am the last to know again?
And yes I am willing to help if I can.
