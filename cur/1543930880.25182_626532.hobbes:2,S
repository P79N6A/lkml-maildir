Really?  Are you sure?  How does the CPU talk to the BIOS?  How about
the parallel port if you have one? (I will assume you have no serial
ports since almost no laptop does anymore).  Just because you don't see
such a bus doesn't mean you don't have one.  Even PCMCIA uses the ISA
bus, although many new laptops are starting to have expresscard slots
instead which elliminates that problem.  LPC (which is ISA in a
different form factor) is still around on most if not all x86 systems.
