Subject: 'make menuconfig' in Konsole, arrows&backspace do not work ?

In text input field in 'make menuconfig', in xterm, everything works.
But in KDE Konsole: arrows do not work, backspace does not work
in input field, cursor is not visible ( only can append chars to
existing value).
How do I fix this ? $TERM is set to 'xterm'. Vim works perfectly
and has blinking cursor. Do I need different $TERM setting ?
Thanks
Yakov
