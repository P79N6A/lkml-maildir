Subject: [PATCH] ncpfs bug
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This patch prevents the NCP fs from hanging in a special case and
generating ill network traffic.
I found the case where the linker first opened the output file, wrote
some bytes in the object file header, and then tried to read at a file
offset behind the file size. The NCP function call succeeds with data
length 0, this forces the ncpfs to stay in an endless loop of retrying
to get this data.
I don't know if this patch breaks any other code. And I don't know who
maintaines the ncpfs. But I hope it the patch will be read by someone
who can get it into the next kernels.
My environment: linux kernel 2.2.9 running on a P166, FDDI network
adapter; the NetWare Server is 4.11 with IWSP5B installed.
