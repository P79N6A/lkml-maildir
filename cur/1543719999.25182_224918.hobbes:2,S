Correct.

I coded your pseudocode up, and I'm convinced now that you and Thomas are right.
 We should prefer panning when it's available
cat /usr/src/linux/MAINTAINERS is 0.3 seconds instead of 1.5 seconds.
On the down side, panning makes screen corruption for me... time to investigate
to see if fbcon or radeonfb is to blame... perhaps panning is just incompatible
with accel engine at all in radeon...
