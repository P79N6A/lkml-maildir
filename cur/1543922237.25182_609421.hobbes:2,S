Uggh. This introduces a global lock that has to be taken always when 
scanning over cpus? Is multipe cpus are scanning over processor lists then 
we will get into scaling problems. Wasnt there an RCU based implementation 
that avoided cacheline bouncing and refcounting?

What was the highest cpu count in testing?
