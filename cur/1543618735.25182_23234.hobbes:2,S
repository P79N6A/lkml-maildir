Nonsense!
I had seen more than 2500 Athlon/Duron system since 26. August 1999.
Most system can handle it.
Best case today, again. Even better than ever.
1.2 GHz Athlon TB (133 FSB, 9.0 multiplier)
MSI MS-6330 v3.0 (K7T Turbo-R, KT133A, 686B)
open case
Win98SE with full VCool 1.7.2 active
BIOS CPU max. 84°C!!!
Then starting Winbloze
drop from 74°C to 23°C CPU, 23°C system temperature
even the cooler was "cool"
During DVD playback
~56°C than down to 23°C, again
And did you forget?
It _is_ an option. --- You can try it and disable it when it fails for you.
Just my 0.02 €.
