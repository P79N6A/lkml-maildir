I don't think so, but IANAL.  What do you think?  Here's what I
think to be the relevant passages.
  [...] The information must suffice to ensure that the continued
  functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or
  interfered with solely because modification has been made.
  [...]
  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include
  a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or
  updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the
  recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or
  installed.  Network access may be denied when the modification
  itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network
  or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the
  network.
