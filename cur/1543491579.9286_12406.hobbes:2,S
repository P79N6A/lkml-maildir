Weel I have something like that.  I put together a very simple rawfs
type about a month ago to do some testing on.  It basically lets you
mount a raw device as a file.  Reads are cached, yet writes are flsuhed
immediately to disk.
If people find this interesting it can be found at
ftp://box.res.cmu.edu/pub/rawfs-1.0.tgz
If people actually find this useful I could spend a couple more hours
and add a whole list of features.  As a note this was designed as a
kernel module, so it should work with any kernels, including 2.0.x, but
I have only tried it on 2.1.x and 2.2.x kernels.
Thanks,
Mathew Monroe
