Hi Linus,
some small s390 patches for 2.5.51. 
The patch overview:
01: Makefile changes as proposed by Sam Ravnborg.
02: sys_restart_syscall for s390/s390x. Following your suggestion I used
    a thread flag (TIF_RESTART_SVC) to indicate the restart condition
    to entry.S.
03: Fixes for the common i/o layer. Among other things I found the race
    condition in do_IRQ that has been plagueing me the last few days.
04: Another uaccess bug. __put_user_asm_8 doesn't return 0 for success.
05: Remove last remaining file of the old tape driver.
06: Arnd scanned through the device drivers and found some variables/functions
    that should better be declared static.
07: Some warnings fixes.
08: Make sys_wait4 available to modules.
blue skies,
  Martin.
