You'll be cpu limited until we have Van Jacobson net channels.
Also, since our existing Linux "generic" MSI code is so riddled with
x86'isms (it was written by an Intel person, so this is just the
status quo), it will be a while before MSI interrupts are supported on
sparc64.
I haven't gotten around to working on that problem yet, and PPC needs
this work too as they now have MSI capable PCI controllers.
