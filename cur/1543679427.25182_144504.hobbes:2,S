Hi,
In multicpu systems in kernel version 2.4.19, how 
can we specify that a function be executed on 
a cpu of our choice(say cpu_2). Moreover if I call a
function from cpu_1 to be executed on cpu_2, I dont
want to wait in cpu_1 until complete execution of
function on cpu_2 . Is it possible?????
Any example would be really helpful. Please 
mail back to vraghava_raju@yahoo.com.
Regards
Raghava.
