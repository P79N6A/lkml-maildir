I am fairly confident something in ac2 is fishy. I can repeatable get
ac2 to fail with PCMCIA and also reiserfs under load, I absolutely
cannot get these failures without ac2.
This is totally repeatable so if you want further diagnostics please
let me know....

P.S. Using 2.95.2 if that matters; it's more or less always works but
     maybe ac2 triggers something there as some people seem to find
     ac2 pretty good?
