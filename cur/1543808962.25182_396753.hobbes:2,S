Au contraire, this is a central issue which you have yet to address.
How do you suggest helping maintainers in the future know which pid they
are working with?
For our vpid patchset we had considered using sparse to make sure that
the real ('kernel') and user ('virtual') pids were never used in place
of each other without going through a conversion.  That could be one
solution.  Using opaque typedefs is of course another solution.  But
suspect there will be places in the code where it simply isn't clear
at first glance which pid you'd want.  And if it's not clear at first
glance, then it's likely to be done wrong in at least some of those
places.
