Yes.
I don't like the patch much, because all that logic should be moved
into page_is_buddy where I put it (surely it is more readable not to
have the checks spilling out -- a page which is not in the correct
zone or is a "hole" is by definition not a buddy, right?)
So, I agree with adding the zone check if any architecture needs it.
But it would be something under CONFIG_HOLES_IN_ZONE, and the arch
needs to *either* align zones correctly (as they've always had to),
or turn this option on.
Thanks for working at this, everyone.
