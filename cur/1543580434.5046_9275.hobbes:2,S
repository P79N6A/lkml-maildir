Another question. The function that prints the "buggy protocol" msg is
dev_queue_xmit_nit(), which is called by dev_queue_xmit(). Isn't that a Tx
function?? What would it have to do with netif_rx() (which from what I
understand is called to send Rx packets upstream, not used in the Tx
datapath)??
Thanks again!
Later,
Ivan
