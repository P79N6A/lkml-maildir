Subject: [PATCH -mm] introduce a false positive macro
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This is a patch to introduce a macro that can be used to suppress false
positives caused by GCC and looked at by a developer to turn off the
warning.
It does NOT turn off the warnings by default!!!
This is to give developers that usually ignore all the "uninitialized
variable" warings an opportunity to turn off these warnings to concentrate
on the ones that they make.
The only true arguement against this is that it makes the code not so
pretty.  Otherwise, it causes no more bloat and may even allow those to
debug better.
Now kernel hacking has an option for developers to turn off the warnings
that were looked at and marked.
This patch only introduces the macro.  If it is accepted, then more
patches need to be made to mark the variables.
Even if a variable is marked incorrectly as not a bug, it's still not
bad, in fact, I would say is better.  Only those that need to look at that
that code should keep this off.  Remember, this only turns off the
warnings if you explicitly do so yourself.
