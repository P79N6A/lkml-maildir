Hi folks,
I tried PM_TRACE to find the driver that breaks resume from suspend.
I got working resume until I switched to the sk98lin driver
(because sky2 doesn't support wake on LAN). That's why I was quite sure that
sk98lin is the culprit, but I tried PM_TRACE anymay.
Here is the PM_TRACE output in dmesg:
  Magic number: 0:150:255
  hash matches drivers/base/power/resume.c:28
  hash matches device 0000:00:1d.3
$ lspci | grep 1d.3
00:1d.3 USB Controller: Intel Corporation 82801G (ICH7 Family) USB UHCI #4
/proc/interrupts:
 17:      52387          0   IO-APIC-level  uhci_hcd:usb5, eth0, i915@pci:0000:00:02.0
 20:    1223105    1222776   IO-APIC-level  ehci_hcd:usb1, uhci_hcd:usb2
Since UHCI #4 (usb5, as ehci is usb1) and eth0 (sk98lin) use the same
interrupt, is it right to assume that the sk98lin driver does bad
interrupt handling and therefore breaks the usb5 device on resume?
Regards,
Tino
