In 2.6.x kernels you are also limited by the 2 TiB limit on block device
sizes, limit which you can extend compiling a 2.6.x kernel with "Large
Block Device" support (menu "Device Drivers" -> "Block devices", at the end).
You will also need filesystems that support that big sizes and can hold
big files on them, have a look at the following URL for more information:
