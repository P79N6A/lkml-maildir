I suspect there's more than that still remaining.  Have you tried
$ grep suspend include/asm-arm -r
?
Also, what about include/linux/device.h's struct device_driver, for
platform device drivers ?
I think there's a significant amount of work still to be done with
the u32 -> pm_message_t conversion before you can even think about
changing pm_message_t to a struct.
