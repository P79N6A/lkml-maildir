OK, from the link you gave I can see that there might be some problems 
with SIL3112 controller + seagate disks...

...but this link just doesn't explain why performance is sooo bad with 
2.6.11.x kernels (Timing buffered disk reads at 10-20 MB/sec), and is 
just OK with older 2.6 kernels (Timing buffered disk reads even at about 
100 MB/sec with 2.6.8.1).
any clue?
or should I wait for 2.6.11.7 (?), where it should be corrected?
