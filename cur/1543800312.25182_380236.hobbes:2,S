I'm surprised Lee fed you this long, but the cold hard fact of the matter is 
that you are posting to the Linux kernel mailing lists, and you will comply 
with these guidelines if you expect help.
I'm sure the problem might not be with VMWare, but there is absolutely nothing 
stopping you from switching nvidia with nv, not loading nvidia/vmware 
modules, then running the TV card doing *something else* for a few hours. If 
you do not detect lockups, contact VMWare. They will probably do the exact 
opposite of what Lee has done and suggest non-VMWare parts of the system are 
at fault.
However, unlike VMWare or NVIDIA, we can actually debug problems if you use 
source-available modules. Thinking outside of the box here is irrelevant -- a 
problem requires logical procedure to gain a solution. Any engineer will tell 
you the same thing. Ordinarily, this is test, observe, retest, and all Lee is 
suggesting is that you do *not* load the proprietary modules.
Try it before responding to this email, so you do not have to write another.
