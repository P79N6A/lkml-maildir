That's essentially what I had to write to move my trees over, so an official 
one would be extremely useful.  I do have the piece which catches the comments 
if you want it.

If bitkeeper had a way of replacing duplicate patches, this would be extremely 
useful.  All I really needed to do was replace the keys in the changelog from 
the garzik tree with the mareclo one to get my changes moved over.  I think 
essentially this could be done with a bk send|bk receive as long as I can tell 
bitkeeper that it needs a substitute set of keys when applying the bkpatch.
