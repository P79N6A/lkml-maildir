I had problems compiling that one:
make[1]: Leaving directory `/data/src/linux-2.4.20/Documentation/DocBook'
gcc -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer -o
scripts/split-include scripts/split-include.c
make: *** No rule to make target `include/linux/autoconf.h', needed by
`include/config/MARKER'.  Stop.
which I find rather strange.
make dep ; make clean ; make boot modules modules_install
should take care of those dependencies, doesn't it?
<...>
Hmmm, for some reason include/linux/autoconf.h doesn't exist at all.
<...>
Oh, I see: I had to run make menuconfig & save the config for that.
That's odd. I just copied my old config to .config, thought that
would do the trick!
