I believe Alan (?) tweaked it between 2.2.2ac7->2.2.3 with the following
patch, which went into 2.2.3:
--- v2.2.2/linux/fs/dquot.c	Mon Sep 28 10:51:34 1998
+++ linux/fs/dquot.c	Sun Mar  7 15:25:23 1999

This seems to have completely fixed it on the two SMP machines using quota
that we just got in when 2.2.2ac7 was out, which one previously oopsed on.  
The oops was in write_dquot(), and it happened every time when I ran
"sync" (sync segfaulted).  I was able to "quotaoff -a", and "sync" then
worked normally again and everything appeared completely stable.  The
machine was almost completely unloaded when this happened, so it shouldn't
be hard to reproduce if the above patch isn't the correct fix.
Unfortunately, I don't have the oops anymore because syslog's symbol file
wasn't right and so syslog just swallowed the oops.  I believe it was just
that dquot->dq_mnt was null, though.
