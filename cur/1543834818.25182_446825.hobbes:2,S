Please read my patch again. The rules are simple: we must disable 
debugging if architecture OR caller mandated alignment is greater than 
BYTES_PER_WORD. Note: for kmem_cache_init() the caller mandated alignment 
_is_ ARCH_KMALLOC_MINALIGN.
My patch takes care of _both_ ARCH_KMALLOC_MINALIGN and 
ARCH_SLAB_MINALIGN.
