Since there's no API offered to send arbitary ATAPI commands to a
device then both need to be modified - but supplying an ioctl in
ide-floppy to issue the command is fairly trivial.

The parameters appear to be the rub at the moment - the unit responds
to a "FORMAT UNIT" command with an all zero command parameter block
with an error indicating an invalid parameter so it presumably *does*
support the command and we "just" need to work out what parameters to
send.
I'll try mailing Panasonic technical support in the morning (since I
own a Panasonic LS120) so watch this space (but don't hold your
breath).
