that's a bit esoteric but, yes, you make a good point.

precisely.   given the definition of "is_power_of_2()" that's been
published, some people will (quite correctly) point out that using
that macro in place of the test "(n & (n - 1))" isn't quite the same
thing.  and they would be correct.
but one wonders how many programmers have been using that very test
"((n & (n - 1))" without realizing that it would accept zero, and that
it has been accepting zero all this time, perhaps leading to weird and
inexplicable errors.
rewriting that test as "is_power_of_2()" may, in fact, cause some
things to suddenly break, but perhaps those are things that should
have been *forced* to break anyway, to identify where the condition
check was incorrect all this time, and someone's just been lucky, or
something like that.
***NOTE***:  and that's why i suggested that the individual
maintainers might want to make this substitution themselves, to make
sure everything continues to work.  because if you leave it as a
project for the kernel janitors, they might not realize what you had
in mind.  so it's in your best interest to start cleaning this up on
your own.
just my $0.02 (Cdn.)
