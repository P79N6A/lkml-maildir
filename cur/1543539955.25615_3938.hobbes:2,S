Take a look at motherboard warranties.
If you flash the BIOS with the tools
THEY provide and the BIOS files THEY
provide you assume the risks if it fails.
The warranty only covers the board AS IT
WAS SHIPPED, even if the BIOS is buggy.
Weather you use their BIOS files or files
from somewhere else, weather you use their
tools or tool from somewhere else, If
you try to flash the BIOS and it kills
the board, the warranty will NOT cover
the replacemet Flash chip with the
correct BIOS, and will never include the
shipping and installation fees that getting
the new chip on yiou board will add.
I know, I asked 4 different manufacturers
and 20 retailers/distributors about it.
This includes retail and OEM versions of
the boards.
