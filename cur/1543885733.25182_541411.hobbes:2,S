Is the qmgr used when the NPEs are utilized as DMA engines? And is the
allocator needed in this case? If yes, I beg you not to drop it,
because we use one NPE for this purpose, and if we are going to adopt
this driver instead of the intel's one, you will receive a patch
adding DMA functionality very soon. ;)
