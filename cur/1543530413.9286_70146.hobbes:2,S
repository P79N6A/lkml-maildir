Today I had exactly this problem. This is the third time in about 160
days.
The box that act as a proxy use the 3c59x module with linux 2.2.10.
I just need to made a /etc/rc.d/init.d/network restart and the network
card
rework correctly without having to restart the box. What is the matter ?
Upgrading is a solution ?
