that's not the problem. you would use get_user_pages to pin the page,
after that such a page it's like a normal plain kernel page allocated
with GFP_KERNEL provided that you never write to it (that's fine, it's
mapped readonly like the regular vsyscall page) and that you don't
pretend it to be constant (again that's fine since if uml changes it
under itself that's its own problem ;).  It's not *that* messy as
breaking the whole copy-user concept. See my other email for more
details on this issue.
