On another thought if we want to keep the return code we should
probably rename it pci_msi_verify().  Or something like that
so it is clear we are not asking if it is supported a question
with a boolean answer.  But merely verifying that it is supported.
At which point if the verification function fails it would
be expected to return an error code, and we could then be
expected to propagate when we receive it.
