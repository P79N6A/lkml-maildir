i have released the -U4 PREEMPT_REALTIME patch:
   
http://redhat.com/~mingo/voluntary-preempt/voluntary-preempt-2.6.9-rc4-mm1-U4
this is a fixes-only release, and it is still experimental code.
Changes since -U3:
 - crash fix: fix the rtc_lock related crash reported by Bill Huey, the 
   rtc_lock is now a raw spinlock again.
 - crash fix: avoid recursion into timer code when PREEMPT_TIMING is 
   enabled.
 - crash/printout fix: revert some of selinux's locks back to raw 
   spinlocks. This could fix the problems reported by Mark H. Johnson, 
   Adam Heath.
 - build fix: fix the compilation problems reported by Lee Revell
 - debug feature: implemented 'print backtrace on all CPUs' on SMP 
   systems, SysRq+L will trigger it.
 - build cleanup: restructure the debug config options. This should 
   resolve the build problems and incompatible debug-options
   problems reported.
 - cleanup: move definitions around, turn on generic rwlocks instead of
   the x86-specific version.
i think all bugs that were reported with logs are fixed in -U4. Please
re-report any issue that might remain.
to create a -U4 tree from scratch the patching order is:
