I have the same problem with the touchpad on a dell inspiron 5000e,
Also having problems with Maestro 2E soundcard (ALSA).
There is also something weird going on with my pcmcia (CardBus TI PCI1225)
ethernet card (NE2000 compat),
but I have to look futher into it to tell for sure it isn't working.
Kernel was compiling just fine, and I was using module-init-tools
0.9.13-pre-1.
