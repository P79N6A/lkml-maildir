Add in here (most important reason, IMHO) that the filesystem wants to make
sure that different copies of redundant metadata are stored on different
physical devices.  It seems pointless to have 4 copies of important data if
a single disk failure makes them all inaccessible.
At the same time, not all data/metadata is of the same importance, so
it makes sense to store e.g. 4 full copies of important metadata like
the allocation bitmaps and the tree root block, but only RAID-5 for
file data.  Even if MD was used to implement the RAID-1 and RAID-5 layer
in this case there would need to be multiple MD devices involved.

Not just different underlying RAID parameters, but completely separate
physical storage characteristics.  Having e.g. metadata stored on RAID-1
SSD flash (excellent for small random IO) while the data for large files
is stored on SATA RAID-5 would maximize performance while minimizing cost.
If there is a single virtual block device the filesystem can't make such
allocation decisions unless the virtual block device exposes grotty
details like "first 1MB of 128MB is really SSD" or "first 64GB is SSD,
rest is SATA" to the filesystem somehow, at which point you are just
shoehorning multiple devices into a bad interface (linear array of block
numbers) that has to be worked around.

This is even true with filesystems other than btrfs.  As it stands today
the MD RAID-1 code implements its own transaction mechanism for the
recovery bitmaps, and it would have been more efficient to hook this into
the JBD transaction code to avoid 2 layers of flush-then-wait_for_completion.
I can't speak for btrfs, but I don't think multiple device access from
the filesystem is a "layering violation" as some people comment.  It is
just a different type of layering.  With ZFS there is a distinct layer
that is handling the allocation, redundancy, and transactions (SPA, DMU)
that is exporting an object interface, and the filesystem (ZPL, or future
versions of Lustre) is built on top of that object interface.
