Won't that possible disturb other RT priority users that do not need 
log IO (e.g. working on preallocated files)? Seems a little
dangerous.
I suspect you want a "higher than bulk but lower than RT" priority
for this really unless there is any block RT priority task waiting
for log IO (but keeping track of the later might be tricky)
