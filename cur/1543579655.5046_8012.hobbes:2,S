  I think they are separate problems.
  The first is power-management suspend/resume issue, and possibly
  PCMCIA problem at software re-insert of card (which never was taken
  out *physically*).
  If I pull the cardbus card out, make sure the  "dhcpcd eth0" has
  died (e.g. I kill it), and re-insert the card, system is highly
  likely to work.
  It is just that if I suspend my laptop with card in, and wakeup it
  latter, there I encounter dead network card.
  Hangup/barfing on system which never suspends will never excercise
  suspend/resume codepaths, but may poke at wrong moment at some register,
  which causes card severe indigestion problems - rx/tx hangup.
  Sadly a "100% Compatible" usually means: "beware odd problems"
