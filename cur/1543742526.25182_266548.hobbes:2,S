Roman, I don't think this is valid. I don't use BK, and my patches still
get in somehow. Neither Greg Kroah or DaveM ever made any issue of it.
If people have ideas, they ought to participate as is, then present
ideas based on their experience. I don't think that BK prevents "a lot
of those people" from working on kernel and presenting ideas.
