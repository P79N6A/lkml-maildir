My solution would fit in the 2nd category... (at the end of make config,
do the checks). menuconfig and xconfig need some changing as well, but the
"make config" case is the hardest...

The migration path would be to throw the entire Config.in system out and
replace it with something more suitable (2.5.x). I have some ideas about
this and will post them soon to l-k.
