Well, exactly this scheme seems to work for __iowrite_copy*.  There's a
weak generic version and a strong version in arch/x86_64/lib that
overrides it, and it gets picked up at kernel link time.
It could be working by accident, I suppose, but it's at least consistent
behaviour with what I'm used to from weak symbols.
