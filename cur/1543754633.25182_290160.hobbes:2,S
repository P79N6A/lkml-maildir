Actually, it happens after my ISP's LCP echos are not coming anymore,
and then when pppd try to reconnect.

I have conntrack modules loaded too. I will try removing 8139too
(on x86) and sungem (on ppc) if the issue occurs again. By the way,
I also have IPv6 loaded, since I use a dual-stacked connection with
native IPv6. How lucky I am! :)

Yep, 2.6.8.1 works fine, this issue appears on 2.6.9 and 2.6.10. I
switched to a Debian 2.6.10 kernel for security reasons, and
the issue has not come yet. I had a glance at the changelog and
saw some network related patches. This is the -as patchset, see
<
http://kerneltrap.org/node/4545>
 about it.
Cheers.
