It's not very important, but it would be a bit more conventional to use
CONFIG_X86, CONFIG_ARCH_S390, CONFIG_IA64 and CONFIG_PPC64 for those cases
where such an ifdef is to be used.
In the above case specifically, no ifdefs should be needed - you can simply
define CONFIG_HANGCHECK_TIMER_FREQ in arch/*/Kconfig.
