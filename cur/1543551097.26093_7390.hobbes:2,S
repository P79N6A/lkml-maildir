You just know what I think about those heuristics. I think all we need is a
per-task pagefault/allocation rate avoiding any other complication that tries
to do the right thing but that it will end doing the wrong thing eventually,
but obviously nobody agreeed with me and before I implement that myself it will
still take some time.
Even the total_vm information will be wrong for example if the task was a
netscape iconized and completly swapped out that wasn't running since two days.
Killing it is going to only delay the killing of the real offender that is
generating a flood of page faults at high frequency.
