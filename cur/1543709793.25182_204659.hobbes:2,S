Hello,
In my initialization scripts for hotplug (written for bash) the
following command is used to redirect output which normally goes to
stderr to the system logger:
"exec 2> >(logger -t $0[$$])"
With kernel 2.4 this command works fine, but with kernel version 2.6.3
it leads to a system hang.
Can anybody help me to solve that problem?
Thanks in advance
  Christoph
