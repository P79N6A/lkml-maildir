Given that libc truncates the high 32 bit, that compat call can only use
low 32 bit,  I begin to really think its better to leave this as int
and avoid the whole issue.
Additional advantage is in keeping 
the exact same interface as ioctl is that its easier to change a driver
to use this interface - just assign the call in field, no other changes.
