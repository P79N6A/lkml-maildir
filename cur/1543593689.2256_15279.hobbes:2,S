Why would quality be lowered if instead of trying and push a Configure.help 
patch to an already busy Linus, one should notify the maintainer ?
Simply because it doesn't gain the same "prestige" to the author ?
*big pain*
I don't forget your proc.5/bootparam.7 argument but it's not the same
point imho.

Not everybody reads a thousand configuration options entry.
If I want a kernel tailored for a specific machine, I keep a .config
somewhere, make oldconfig and so on. I don't read a Configure.help
entry that hasn't changed for months. Documentation/Changes is enough.
If I want to build the usual "does everything compile?" kernel, the
Configure.help entry isn't that needed.
If it's the first time I compile a kernel, $DISTRIBUTION could include 
the extra package somewhere. Outdated ? We aren't talking about people 
working with testing versions thus I doubt it's really a problem.

Yes. However, the point of "Configure.help doesn't belong to core"
makes sense (as long as it doesn't prevent compile).
