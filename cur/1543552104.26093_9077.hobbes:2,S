Not true.  Cary is quite large and is the fastest growing city in NC as of
1999 figures.  It is right next to Raleigh and houses a lot of tech offices.
Lucent, Cable & Wireless, HP.  You would be amazed at the tech nology
centers there.  Matter of fact, Research Triangle Park is just down the
road.
Not all of NC, or the South for that matter, is a hotbed of ignorance.

Cary, NC. can't be very large. There are, probably, three persons in
the whole county than have computers. Two haven't been booted since
the day the were received by the kids because they've been busy
studying for the M-CAP test.
