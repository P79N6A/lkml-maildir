I prefer Pig Latin myself. ;)

There's no way on earth I would ever start reading at the beginning of 3
million lines of code just so I can understand bobsdriver.o, which is
only 10,000 lines. I should not have to start at the beginning of
bobsdrvier.o either if I only needed to solve one problem in one
function somewhere near the end of it.
I have worked on several large projects and have rarely known how every
piece of any of them worked. I didn't have to. I only needed to know
about the portion(s) I was responsible for. I was able to do that with
the better projects because they were commented correctly and were
rather self documenting.

Actually it bloats the source (we all know C++ bloats the resulting code
;), but what's wrong with that? At least a person can understand what's
going on and get to coding, instead of deciphering.
