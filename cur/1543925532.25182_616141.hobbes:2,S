first of all it's obvious that there can't be any guarantee that your 
CONFIG_FOO variable will actually get the value bar since dependencies 
might enable or disable it despite you wanting the opposite.
Another important point is that users that know about and see CONFIG_* 
variables are kernel hackers, not the normal kconfig users.

I'm wondering why you don't use two different O= output directories 
instead?
Depending on the CONFIG_ option in question this might even greatly 
reduce your compile times.
And you won't upgrade the kernel you work against that
often compared to working on and testing of your own changes when 
developing code.

That's clear.
