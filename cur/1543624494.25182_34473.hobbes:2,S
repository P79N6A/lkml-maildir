You don't understand by accident that sometimes blind untested
changes serve the purpose of hinting at API changes in
areas where once doesn't have the slightest opportunity
of testing? Just simple count how many FS there are out there
and you should see that there is no chance for "quality"
testing before submission of advancements there.
Breakage is the price you have to pay for advancements.
(I'm not arguing over the particular case in quesiton here.
I'm just arguing over the proposal.)
