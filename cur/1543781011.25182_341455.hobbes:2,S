Subject: Edge triggered epoll with pts devices acts as level triggered

Waiting for edge triggered events (with EPOLLET) on pseudo terminal
devices appears to act as if it were level triggered; when data is
ready the fd is always returned by epoll_wait.
You can test this with the code below. Compile, run and press return.
If edge triggering is working correctly a single event will be
generated, otherwise a never ending stream will start.
This works *correctly* at a real terminal, but fails for pseudo
terminals (specifically an xterm). As far as I can test with other
terminals and ssh this is a general problem with pseudo terminals.

        memset(&ev, 0, sizeof(ev));
        ev.events = EPOLLIN | EPOLLET;
        epoll_ctl(epoll_fd, EPOLL_CTL_ADD, 0, &ev);
        for (;;) {
                epoll_wait(epoll_fd, events, 4, -1);
                write(1, ".", 1);
        }
}
Thanks
