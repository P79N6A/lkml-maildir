Subject: 2.6.28-git3 and i915 Kconfig new dependency on framebuffer

make oldconfig from -git2 to -git3 doesn't build i915.ko unless
 one has CONFIG_FB enabled; this causes /dev/dri/card0 to
 be missing, and DRI disabled from within X.
Do I now (2.6.28-git3+) need CONFIG_FB to enable i915 DRM ?
Thanks,
