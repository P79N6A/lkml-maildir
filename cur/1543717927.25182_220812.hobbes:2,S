Will do. The _RESERVED masks are sometimes more related to the driver
than the hardware, so I think I'll keep those in the driver. But all
the hardware-related defines can be moved.

For the cputable framework I would need at least 11 feature bits
(5 for pm_type, 6 for pll_type), with more later if/when G5 docs
ever become public. <asm-ppc/cputable.h> currently has 14 free
feature bits.
Encoding these as enumeration subfields in the high end of
cpu_features instead would require 3+3 bits (preferably 4+4
for future expansion).
So I can:
1. steal a big chunk of the remaining cpu_features bits, or
2. add pm_type and pll_type fields to struct cpu_spec, or
3. continue to keep this in the driver
Which would you prefer?
