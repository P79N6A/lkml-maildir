Of course.  It works for any filename beginning with the string "Kbuild".  Major
mode rules are on a first match basis, so you have to make sure this rule is
ahead of the .asm rule.  I'll push a patch to the XEmacs guys so it works this
way by default, someone else can deal with Stallman.
Please take the emacsism out of the file as it bothers Andrew and others.
