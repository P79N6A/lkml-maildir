1.
 struct inode_operations modification prevents umdos module from compiling
2.
The bmap field has been removed from the inode_operations struct defined
in include/fs.h.  However, this field is still referenced in 
fs/umsdos/inode.c (line 156), causing the compiler to abort.  The bmap 
field is in the struct for kernel version 2.2.5, however is missing in 
kernel version 2.3.11 (and 2.3.12).  
3.
bmap, inode_operations, umsdos.
