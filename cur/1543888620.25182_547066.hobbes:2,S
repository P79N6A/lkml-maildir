Tagging boot consoles (aka early_printk) with CON_BOOT certainly makes 
sense.  Just doing that doesn't work for ia64?
What is the point in making that work on x86 additionally to serial 
support in early_printk?  It might make sense to split away the serial 
bits from early_printk.c and move them out of arch/ into -- say -- 
drivers/serial/, so other architectures can use that too and we have 
only one serial earlyprintk implementation in the kernel.  Not sure it 
is worth the effort given the code size.
cheers,
   Gerd
