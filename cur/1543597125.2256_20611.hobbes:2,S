It as actually disabled on purpose.
It's there because without it the backtrace is sometimes so full of crud
that it is almost impossible to read.
I chose to disable the module back-trace, because what we should _really_
do is to walk the vmalloc space and verify whether it's a valid address or
not. But as I don't use modules myself, I didn't have much incentive to do
so, or to test that it worked.
The simple "disable module backtraces" approach at least makes the normal
backtraces possible to read sanely (well, you still have the issue that
gcc often ends up leaving tons of empty stackslots around and those can
contain stale information, but that can't be fixed as easily).
