The standard way to fix this is to add an explicit check for lapic
to the early argument parsing in setup.c (but keep the __setup so that
no unknown argument is reported).
I think that's better than moving it and getting possible bugs that cannot
even be catched with early printk.
Another way that i've considered on x86-64 for 2.7 at least is a special
__early_setup() for this
