Hi,
I've tried with:
	echo 0 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/route/flush 
ip route flush cache is equivalent to: 
	cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/route/min_delay > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/route/flush
It does not solve anything.
I don't know why.
So not even flushing manually the cache solves
the problem.
Any ideas about why?
	Manel
