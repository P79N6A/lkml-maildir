Thanks for the correction although i wouldn't say "never".
I did have experience with some minis where the NIC did
handle ICMP internally for anything on the local subnet for
which it already had an arp entry.  But these NICs had
68000s as embedded processors, did bi-directional DMA and
offloaded part of the network stack.  The NIC would continue
to respond even while a new kernel was being booted,
glitching only when the NIC was reset.  Back when CPU clocks
were 16MHz this kind of offloading made sense.  My
experience seems to have clouded current expectations.
