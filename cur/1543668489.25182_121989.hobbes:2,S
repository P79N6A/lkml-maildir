Subject: 2.4.18: lru_list_lock contention in write_unlocked_buffers()

Hello,
when I run mkfs while doing other large file I/O in parallel,
the system response becomes terribly bad on 2.4.18 kernel.
(probably on other 2.4 kernels also)
I found there are hard contention on lru_list_lock, which is mostly held
by write_unlocked_buffers().
It happens only on large memory machine because lru_list can grow very long
and write_some_buffers() scans the long list from head on each call.
Lowlatency patch in aa tree did not help this situation.
The patch below is hasty workaround for it.
Any comments, or suggestions to better fix?
For example, on 8 CPUs and 16GB memory system, I've run:
  - 4 instance of 'dd if=/dev/zero of=somefile'
  - 1 instance of mke2fs
  - more than 5 top to keep other CPUs busy
Output of SGI lockstat for the test looked like:
SPINLOCKS         HOLD            WAIT
  UTIL    MEAN(  MAX )   MEAN(  MAX )     TOTAL   NAME
 93.6%    83us( 549ms)   56ms(1591ms)   5076092   lru_list_lock
 92.9%    45ms( 520ms)   26us(6703us)      9283     write_unlocked_buffers+0x30

Best regards.
