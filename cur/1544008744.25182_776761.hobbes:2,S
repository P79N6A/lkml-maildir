Hi Soni,
At first, I tried to support tsc2007 with ads7846.c. But it required
some kind of
common logic to support both SPI and I2C for the driver, as you thought.
If I modified the ads7846.c to support tsc2007, the driver might be a
bit more complicate.
I do not know which method is better, but making a different driver
was simppler for me.
Thank you.
