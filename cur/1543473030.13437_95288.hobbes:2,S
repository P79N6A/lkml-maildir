Hi everybody,
this is just a quick announcement that the Linux Memory Management
page has moved from the unreliable (it's down now) www.phys.uu.nl
to the (hopefully a lot better) humbolt.geo.uu.nl.
The new URL is: <
http://humbolt.geo.uu.nl/Linux-MM/>
(also works without the capital letters).
Since I'll be very very busy updating the rest of the site,
I'd appreciate it if some bored people on this list could
swarm the net and update all now-out-of-date pointers.
(a referral page is not enough ;ince the old server is down
and won't be up again until our sysadmin comes back from his
christmas-and-some-more-days-off)
Btw, the machine also contains some mailing lists that could
be of interest to the European hacker-students around here...
cheers,
Rik van Riel.
