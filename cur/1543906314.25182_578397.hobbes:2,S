Roger, you are my hero. :)
With that PCI-e setting (again, for the record, this is on a Supermicro 
X7DBE motherboard,
and the BIOS setting is PCIe I/O performance, which has two states: 
Coalesce and Payload 256B)
all of the four machines have survived a half day of continous bashing. 
Previously one, or two
machines typically fell off after such amount of IO load, so it looks 
promising so far.
I hope this won't change over the time.
BTW, this is still with 2.6.21.5, because the SCSI target stuff I use 
(SCST) has some
-I hope temporary- problems with changed (deleted) interfaces in newer 
kernels.
Should the DEBUG_SHIRQ problem in e1000 affect stability (or performance)?
Thanks,
