There are scads of problems like these.  I haven't posted mine because I
didn't know yet if it was kernel or X related.
Some of the issues I have on my laptop are:  (i'm 99.9% of the time in X)
- w/ ACPI, battery usage is a constant.  no savings period, no other issues
but no savings anywhere.
- w/ APM, a whole slew of issues.
    - on resume from standby, frequently the keyboard is semi lost.  magic
key works, nothing else works.  resetting the keyboard doesn't fix anything,
i'm leaning on this being an X issue.
    - some pcmcia cards don't resume, requiring a soft eject/insert.  hard
eject crashes machine.
    - sometimes the display doesn't return.  the backlight flickers once but
then remains black.  subsequent manual standby/suspend states cannot fix
this, gotta reboot.  network login works.  switch to VC works.
    - w/ some kernels, floppy starts spinning on resume, have to try to mount
something then unmount it to get the spindle to shut down.  altho i use the
same base .config file from kernel to kernel, some kernels do this, some
don't.
