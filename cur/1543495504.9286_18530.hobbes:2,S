  Good Morning !!!
I have noticed 2 mistakes in "video4linux" (kernel 2.2.8):
1. There is small typo in "Documentation/video4linux/API.html", line 147:
VDIOCGCHAN  (bad, because first "I" is missing)
instead of VIDIOCGCHAN.
2. In Documentation/video4linux/API.html there is flag for channel,
called VIDEO_VC_NORM .
This value is not defined in any file (IMO it should be
defined in "include/linux/videodev.h") in linux-2.2.8.tar.gz .
