The "readahead turned itself off" thing is there to avoid doing lots of
pagecache lookups in the very common case where the file is fully cached.
The place which needs attention is handle_ra_miss().  But first I'd like to
reacquaint myself with the intent behind the lazy-readahead patch.  Was
never happy with the complexity and special-cases which that introduced.

`index' is a pagecache index and desc->count is a byte counter.
