I think that I made a mistake,
I now reverted the patch that fixes the above error, and I wrote down back-trace from this hang,
and it appears that system hangs in kthread_stop:
This I have written in paper, using kdb:
workqueue_cpu_callback ->
cleanup_workqueue_thread ->
kthread_stop ->
and then wake_up_process (I think , I didn't wrote this on paper, I will check again)
