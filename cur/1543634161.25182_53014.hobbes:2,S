Just wanted to know if this is a known problem and if it might be fixed in
the near future:
Using 2.4.19-pre8 just one filesystem with reiserfs, I exported a directory. Mounted
it on another hosts and started writing a large (500mb) file to it, that resulted
in the server filesystem going full and the server locked up hard.
