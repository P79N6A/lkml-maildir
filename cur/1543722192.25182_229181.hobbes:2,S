STANDALONE avoids any drivers not using external firmware.
PREVENT_FIRMWARE_BUILD just prevents the supplied firmware to be build.
So no I do not see they should be dependent.
But for sure they should be located in the same place.
This is drivers only information and not related to the actual
maturity of the code - so moving STANDALONE to drivers/base
makes sense to me.
Adrian - care to submit a patch?
