I've been going through GDB test failures (... again...) and I'm down
to a respectably small number on x86_64, but this is one of the
remaining ones.  I don't suppose there's been any change since we
discussed this in April?
A refresher for those following along: there's a GDB test that mmaps a
file using MAP_PRIVATE and PROT_WRITE.  It expects the contents to end
up in the core dump.  Right now, they don't.  I can fix the test by
making sure it writes to the mapping, but before I change the test,
I want to raise the question of what _should_ be in a core dump.
I took a peek at what Solaris includes in core dumps.  They offer
(not surprisingly) a pile of configuration options.  The default is
just about everything except for file-backed shared memory and some
symbol table data - it includes text segments, rodata, anonymous shared
memory, file backed mappings, et cetera.  I guess that's another
argument in favor of dumping more.  Then you can control it globally,
per process, et cetera.

I also checked an AIX manual since there was a reference to SA_FULLDUMP
in the GDB test:
 By default, the user data, anonymously mapped regions, and vm_infox
 structures are not included in a core dump. This partial core dump
 includes the current thread stack, the thread thrdctx structures, the
 user structure, and the state of the registers at the time of the
 fault. A partial core dump contains sufficient information for a stack
 traceback. The size of a core dump can also be limited by the setrlimit
 or setrlimit64 subroutine.
 To enable a full core dump, set the SA_FULLDUMP flag in the sigaction
 subroutine for the signal that is to generate a full core dump. If this
 flag is set when the core is dumped, the user data section, vm_infox,
 and anonymously mapped region structures are included in the core dump.
Not really sure what that translates to, but it's less than what
Solaris dumps, I think.
Does Linux need knobs for this?
