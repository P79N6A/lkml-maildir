maybe it could be included - dependent on PREEMPT, just like we have SLOB?
it would also be rather educative IMO: if someone wants to understand the 
core concepts of RCU, start with kernel/rcutiny.c. We are getting 
complaints from academic institutions that the Linux kernel is getting too 
complex to teach in courses - and that's a pity.
