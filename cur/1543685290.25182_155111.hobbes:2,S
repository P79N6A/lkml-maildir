I think that the chip used on my card at least (TI PCI1031), has an 
option of delivering ISA IRQs via the IRQSER (I think this is the same 
as PCI SERRn/SERIRQ signals).
 From what I can gather (I might be totally wrong), I think this is 
likely to be used on some laptops, as the PCI SERRn/SERIRQ signal was a 
proposed standard, and never actually made it's way onto a standard PCI 
slot, however some pci host bridges implement this (e.g. Intel PIIX, I 
think), so I'd guess quite a few laptops may have their PCI1xxx chips 
wired to the PCI host bridge like this, as this would be the cheapest 
and most flexible option if it is available ("parallel" ISA IRQ delivery 
uses more PCB traces, and PCI interrupts pose driver compatibility 
problems).
The alternative way of using IRQSER interrupts appears to be to have an 
external TI PCI950 chip do the serial to parallel IRQ conversion, 
although I've no idea why you'd want to bother with this, when the 
PCI1xxx chips can do this already, with the caveat, that they can only 
deliver ISA IRQs 3,4,5,7,9,10,11,12,14,15.
I'm willing to hack on this code a bit, as I got my PCI1031 PCI card 
working under 2.4, with some patching.  This card (SCM Microsystems 
"Swapbox") implements PCI interrupts only, and has two slots.  
Interestingly, this card seems to work OK under win9x, so I suppose they 
figured out how to do it on that code base, but under w2k, you have to 
tweak a registry setting to tell it to use PCI irqs...

Well, I have a spare PCI1031 PCI card, which I can test, and hack on.  
We could certainly use some more testers, but this is a start...

Sounds good...  However, one possible gotcha might be that the physical 
IRQ pins are shared, and operate differently in different modes so it 
may be possible to make a mess if you configure the chip wrong:
e.g. PCI1031
pin   function
154   IRQ3/PCI INTA
155   IRQ4/PCI INTB
157   IRQ7/PCDMAREQ
158   IRQ9/IRQSER
159   IRQ10/CLKRUN
160   IRQ11/PCDMAGNT
163   IRQ15/RI_OUT
So maybe (not sure) if you put the chip in PCI interrupt mode first, it 
will spray the ISA interrupts pins, if the system is wired up this way 
(I know nearly nothing about ISA and PCI from an electrical point of 
view, so I've no idea if this would happen in practice, but it at least 
seems possible)?
Maybe:
- Probe for parallel ISA IRQs first (maybe on non shared pins if poss - 
on the PCI1031, IRQs 5,12,14 have their own dedicated pin)
- Next, probe for serial ISA IRQs
- Finally, probe for PCI IRQs
If probing seems impossible or unsafe, I suppose the only way to do it 
would be module/kernel options.
There are some TI PCI1xxx data sheets here:

my (unfinished, but WorksForMe (tm)) 2.4 / TI PCI1031 patch is here:

Some evidence for IRQSER / PIIX possiblity:
