The first question that comes to my mind is whether nice levels should 
be linear or not.  I would lean towards nonlinear as it allows a wider 
range (although of course at the expense of precision).  Maybe something 
like "each nice level gives X times the cpu of the previous"?  I think a 
value of X somewhere between 1.15 and 1.25 might be reasonable.
What about also having something that looks at latency, and how latency 
changes with niceness?
What about specifying the timeframe over which the cpu bandwidth is 
measured?  I currently have a system where the application designers 
would like it to be totally fair over a period of 1 second.  As you can 
imagine, mainline doesn't do very well in this case.
