Hi,
Just noticed that readprofile doesn't work as well as it used too in
2.5.8-pre3 at least (-pre2 too, dunno how far back this goes...). I get
very few accounted symbols as compared to 2.4, and lots seem to be
missing (block stuff, ide stuff, etc).
I'll investigate this further, but maybe this problem is already known.
