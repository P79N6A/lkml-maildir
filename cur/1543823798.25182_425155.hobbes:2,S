As already discussed here, not all graphical
applications should be rewritten, but only some
layers.
And none, if we can emulate X.

Unix was NOT designed for graphics.
Linux is supposed to be *modern*.
The kernel already drives the files system, the
network, the cdrom, the cpu, etc. Why not the graphics
?
Why dont we have "good" 3D support in X ?

I trust the linux kernel to command my hardware
correctly, so why not the graphical too ?

Put X in the kernel, so we dont have 7924 bad written
incompatible implementations of it.
Even much better : put a replacement for X (and an X
emulation for old softwares), so we can have
simplicity, speed, 3D etc.
In my opinion, graphics do belong to the OS, like
sound, network and file system.
