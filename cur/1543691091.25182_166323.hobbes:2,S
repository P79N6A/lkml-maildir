by the way ... this is wrong. as it turned out later, it was not possible
to repair the usb-flashdisk-utility from the vendor. in w2k, it will
appears as "unknown security device" with a big yellow question mark.
so if you want to ruin your stick, proceed as follows:
 - fdisk /dev/sd?
 - go to expert menu
 - set numer of cyls twice as high
 - go back to normal menu
 - make partition of full size with new cyl.count
happy mke2fsing ;-)
after rebooting (machine will be in unusable state), the device wont be recognized
as usb-storage device. reason: the number of usb-endpoints suddenly dropped to 0 (zero).
I don't know if every stick acts this way .. but the Panram one does definitely.
all right then. end of thread ...
