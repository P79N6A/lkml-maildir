As far as I know:
It was initially developed as a C front end to VUCK, but was later
re-written, using none of the VUCK code, but initially keeping parts
of the C front end.  The GNU project was originally developed without
using any proprietary software.
So, non-GPL software was used, but the software that was used was, at
least to begin with, all non-proprietary.
