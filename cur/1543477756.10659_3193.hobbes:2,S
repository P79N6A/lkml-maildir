In some earlier versions of the Linux kernel, I found that it was possible
to chmod a process directory in /proc in order to make it unreadable by
other users. This was a cool feature for enhancing privacy.
Now that I'm running 2.2.0-pre2, I find I can no longer change the
permissions on /proc directories for processes that I own. It would be cool
if the older functionality came back. It would be even cooler if child
process directories inherited the same permissions as their parent.
