Hi all,
Hoping that the problems with alloc_pages where solved I installed suse 7.3
on a SMP machine with 2 GB of memory.
This machine had some problems with the 2.4.4 kernel, constant crashes in X,
but looks stable with the new kernel 2.4.10, however I ocassionally see the
following message:
__alloc_pages: 0-order allocation failed
which is a bit strange as I know for sure that there is at least 15 MB of
unused memory on the machine when the messages appeared.
The result of the above message is that finally X crashed, but also
applications like ssh stopped working.
I hope someone can help me solve this problem. For the rest I can say that
this kernel is much more stable than the 2.4.4 I was previously running.
So keep up the good work.
