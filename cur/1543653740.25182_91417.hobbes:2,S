I use -momit-leaf-frame-pointer for optimization in some own projects, 
instead of the "-fomit-frame-pointer". For me, this results in better 
codesize/speed compared to both "-fomit-frame-pointer" or no option at 
all. Actually gcc-2.95 seems to support this feature as well, but it 
never made it into the 2.95 docs... It makes debugging a lot easier too.
So anyone "caring to benchmark", could you please test the 
"-momit-leaf-frame-pointer" option for x86 as well...
