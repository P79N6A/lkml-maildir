Linux 2.2 has been doing it's impression of Windows NT on my box.
It is a solid instant freeze with no warning, usually following some sort of
heavy CPU or disk load. Not during the load...but after it.
It seems very much like a freeze from an overclocked CPU. (Except that it
happens AFTER a load instead of during)  So I clocked down my CPU's. Still
happening...I see about 1 lock per day. It does not and has not happened at all
with 2.0.36.
Something I noticed with 2.2 is my bogomips are no longer even. Normal?
processor       : 0
cpu MHz         : 451.031357        
bogomips        : 448.92    
processor       : 1
cpu MHz         : 451.031357
bogomips        : 450.56 
Ideas?
