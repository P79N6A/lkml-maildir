Yeah, it does seem like exposing GPIOs to user space would be really
useful. Coming up with credible semantics seems a bit tricky though, and
may not fit the read/write model that we know and love.

Sigh. Yes, I can probably use libusb for this application. Not as easily
as I can hack up the kernel, but it should do the trick.
