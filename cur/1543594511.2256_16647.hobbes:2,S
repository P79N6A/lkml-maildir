Subject: [PATCH] saner limit for max_threads
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi,
by default the limit for max_threads is such that
the system will try to allocate up to half the
physical memory in task_structs.
Because for each 8kB task struct we'll often want
a struct_mm, a page directory, 3 page tables and
some more structures, this means that a fork bomb
will leave the box DEAD with root never ever getting
a chance of using his reserved tasks and killing the
bad user.
The patch below adjusts the max_threads calculation
to something which should be more sane, though quite
possibly still to high...
Please apply for the next -pre kernel.
thanks,
Rik
