First of all, you're right.

Whatever.  Obviously this thread is diving quickly into everyone yelling and no
one listening.  Let's pull it back to where we need to be.

What kind of scheduling I want?  I just want an algorithm that doesn't fall apart
completely when the system is very heavily loaded.  And right now, we linearly
walk the runqueue under a spinlock and re-calculate the goodness of everything on
it every time we call schedule().  While it's not bad on a small system, it's
horrible on a larger one.  I just want something that works well on both my
workstation and the large servers I work on.  Or at the very least, the ability to
switch between them, be it at runtime or compile time.  Or someone to show me just
how wrong I am. :)

Heh.  You may not believe it, but that's a point of view I've been fighting for
around here for quite a while.  It's just starting to get somewhere.

I agree, those cache misses are probably going to be exacerbated on a large system
as well.  I never fully understood the concept of "no worse than X% degradation
over previous" being considered acceptable.

Gawd...I'm getting tired of agreeing with you already ;)  I'm quite honestly busy
here trying to teach people building Tru64 some of the lessons that Linux
teaches.  I'm very concerned that the SGIs and IBMs that are coming along (and, of
course, in some fashion the Compaqs) with all this pent up "experience" are only
going to screw Linux into the ground just like they have their own operating
systems.
The guarding factor is that there are people like Linus, Alan, David, yourself and
many others that will hopefully make sure only the right answers are used.  And
hopefully everyone else will learn from the decisions made.

Not if they are not done cleanly and clearly with an eye on the future.  If we can
always be thinking of doing what's right, and not necessarily just what's easy or
obvious, I think Linux will be just fine.

I am a "perf guy".  And I don't want performance hacks.  I think hacks just for
the sake of benchmarks are, well, disgusting.  I want designs that aren't narrowly
focussed on any one application of an operating system, be it the person who just
installed Linux on his/her old PC at home or the company that just installed it on
their big new shiny server.
Larry, you mentioned that you had thoughts on what Linux has to do to work on big
servers.  I'm imagining, given your background and the content of this email, that
they are also ideas that won't harm the performance on small systems (e.g.
desktops).  I must have missed them somehow - could you recap?  If people like the
ideas, I'll do everything to help.  Maybe Compaq will to.... :)  (Of course, I
can't speak for anyone but myself, now can I? ;)
