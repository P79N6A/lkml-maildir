Are you familar with IBM's Event Logging? 
http://evlog.sourceforge.net/
Event Logging works well in a clustered environment. You can have your logs go 
to one central location and, with the help of a plug-in, you could dump the 
messages off into a database for easy queries. Mark Megerian at IBM is 
working with a DB2 plug-in. Here's the thread on the evlog mailing list:
