Two options: either continue to use BSD ptys (the kinds of stuff you
describe above is actually the one case where BSD ptys is a better
choice than Unix98 ptys) *or* create symlinks -- or if that doesn't
work for you, device nodes -- dynamically.
I.e. have a program which opens /dev/ptmx, gets a slave pty with a
specific ptsname(), then does a symlink() into a suitable directory.
The symlink is your persistent name.
