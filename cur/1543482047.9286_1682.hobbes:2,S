I've changed my mind.  For a VMA skiplist, I would try a polynomial
congruential generator similar to the kind used by BSD random(), as that
can also be extremely fast, and is pretty good.

The LFSR suggestion doesn't involve any blocking.  An LFSR, which is
very fast, provides random bits though they are not particularly good.
A skip list only needs bits, which suits an LFSR.  New entropy is used
to stir the LFSR value to keep it fair -- to avoid identifiable long
term patterms.  That is only done when new entropy arrives, not when a
random bit is required.
