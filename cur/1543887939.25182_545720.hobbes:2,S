Err,__be32 and the company are just sparse things, while I have compiler
checks with my struct ubi32_t and friends. JFFS2 also uses the same
technique. Why do you force me to rely on sparse instead instead of
compiler?
Well, I see the good side of your change - no home-brewed media<->cpu
things. Fair enough and nice. But why don't you make __be32 a struct
(just like I do) so that compiler could complain then?
