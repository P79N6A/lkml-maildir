No, my point was precisely that Peter's patch changes the display
problem into a different display problem.  It will report a 1.9TB
filesystem as a 300MB filesystem, because some of the bit-shuffling is
wrong.
I've attached a patch which illustrates a fix to the SCSI device size
reporting problem in Peter's 2TB patch (the fix was found by HJ Lu).  It
probably won't apply cleanly due to version drift (and of course it
definitely won't apply to a stock kernel), but it indicates what's
wrong.
