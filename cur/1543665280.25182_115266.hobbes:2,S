I of course thought about that (I'm not yet
hit *that* hard by sf syndrome :-), but:
a) I might extend cssc, but bitbucket is
naturally layer *over* cssc, and cssc
is GNU program (copyright assignment
needed) and is C++. I do not feel like
writing new code in C++, and I do not
like their codingstyle.
b) take something else, *merge cssc to
it*, then add my stuff. Ouch. svn is out
because of licensing, cvs is not powerfull
enough, and I do not like arch. (I did
not know abojt opencm, sorry). Ouch
and this would mean fork, anyway,
because developers of that project
would probably not be happy about
those copyrights (FSF!).
c) so new sf project is indeed way to go :-(.
I hope you understand now,
