Certainly - and that is one reason we don't want to do something like this
generally. On x86 we do this for broken IDE controllers for example

I put that to Linus once. It turns out you get some amazingly complex 
dependancy issues. Suppose it is a shared IRQ. Suppose the core code doesnt
know which IRQ is involved - for example networking isnt too clued up on 
every IRQ allocated to a networking device.
In the few cases it really matters we do it using disable_irq, but even then
you have to be careful. Disabling at the irq source isnt enough, you have to
mask the IRQ on the PIC/APIC. If you don't then eventually the PC IRQ 
propogation delay gets you. You disable the irq on the chip and do a normal
spinlock and an irq arrives between the disable being done and the IRQ
coming in over the apic bus.
It happens. It took a lot of work to figure quite why 8390.o was deadlocking

How do you handle nested locks in such a case ?
