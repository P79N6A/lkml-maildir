Calm down, David.  BK really is pretty fast.  Here's a point by point 
rebuttal to your mail.
First of all, I don't think you read the mail.  Let me quote:

That's a 48Kbyte/sec link.  Hardly a "horribly fast network".  In fact,
the bandwidth to FSMlabs.com and innominate.org seems to be identical,
I suspect that my link is the bottleneck, not either of theirs.
In order for the link to be the reason for the performance difference,
innominate.org would need to be a .9Kbyte/second link.  I kinda doubt
that seeing as a 128MB cvs checkout took 23 minutes (works out to around
90Kbyte/sec uncompressed, so cvs must compress it, so I'd guesstimate
they have around a 30Kbyte/sec link or so).
Second of all, if you ask around, you'll find that I'm a performance guy
more than anything and that I'm not given to skewing the numbers and *if*
that was your point, I resent the implication.
Third, BK is designed to be that much faster.  It's inherent in the
nature of a distributed repositories with changesets.  I can, and did,
reboot the machine, did the test again, and it took an average of 1.56
seconds per tree to do a null pull.
Fourth, non-null pulls are similarly faster, again, by design.  BK only
moves the data it needs to move.  That means if you have a 100GB file
in which you have changed one byte, BK will move on the order of 1 byte
to update that file.  And that's it - it doesn't compare the two files,
or read the two files, or in any way look at the two files to figure out
that they need to be updated.  It knows.  That's a benefit of having 
changesets, I only need to compare the ChangeSet file to know that 4 files
were updated 2 were moved, and 5 were created, then I move those *portions*
of those files across the wire.  Other than the initial repository create
(aka cvs checkout), BK *never* moves an entire file across the wire.
Never means never and includes the process of deciding what to do.  CVS
moves whole files just to discover there is nothing to do.
