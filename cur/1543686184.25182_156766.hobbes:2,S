I prefer keeping the conditional statement separate from the condition, but 
either way works.  One thing I've noticed though is that one line if statements 
are difficult to debug in a debugger because there is no way to tell by watching 
the current debug line whether the conditional statement was executed or not. 
For that reason I use a two line if.  Of course, rumor has it that real 
programmers don't use debuggers....  :)
I would rather use the extra lines for two line if statements, then make up for 
that used space by avoiding unnecessary braces.
