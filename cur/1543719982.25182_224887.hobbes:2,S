Yup, you broke the kernel, you get to keep both pieces :)

I agree that we should document this better.  This thread has shown

Panicing the kernel is not really acceptable, even if you did just
scribble accross any portion of kernel memory in your show() function.
Just be aware of the size and code your show() function to be defensive
and not overrun that size.
