Looking at this a little further kobject_rename is a complete noop
when sysfs support is not compiled in.  That is the kobject does not
get renamed, even if the higher level objects do.
This makes the wireless dependency on an error code from kobject_rename
completely bogus as the kobject layer is not prepared to give any kind of
reliable result, and it makes kobject_rename completely bogus if sysfs
support is not compiled in.
Further there is no locking to guarantee renames are atomic
or mutually exclusive at the kobject level.
With no locking and code that does nothing in the absence of sysfs
attempting to check renames for validity at the kobject level (when
renames don't happen at the kobject level) is totally bogus.
Since renames don't happen at the kobject level checking them for
sanity at the kobject level makes no sense.
