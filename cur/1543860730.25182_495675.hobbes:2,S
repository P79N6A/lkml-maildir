Translation:  Problems disappear in 2.6.21 because Jeff will revert the 
code I touched to its previous state -- always calling 
pci_request_regions() -- and all the problems I introduced by avoiding 
pci_request_regions() will go away.
Why INTRODUCE these 2.6.20 Alan-isms, if they are going away in 2.6.21?

Where?  AFAICS, it is crystal clear the behavior:
* Prior to your patch, ata_piix in legacy mode calls 
pci_request_regions() to intentionally reserve ALL regions on the PCI 
device.
* After your patch, the code explicitly calls pci_request_region() for 
BARs 0-4, but never for BAR5.
Another driver is now free to claim a PCI BAR, and start running the 
hardware in AHCI mode, whee!
