	Sure it does. Yes, looking at SunOS manpage (and behaviour on
tmpfs, ufs and nfs) it looks like sticky bit on regular files is
explicitly prohibited from being changed by non-root. *BSD simply don't
allow sticky bit on regulars (and ignore it if it was set by something
else). Compatibility with ancient times. So we probably shouldn't allow
users to set it on regular files. Maybe shouldn't allow to mess with it at
all. AFAICS we should do it in fs/attr.c::inode_change_ok() (to cover NFSD
too).
