Subject: [PATCH] [3/4] SCHED: don't inline idle_balance into schedule()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/11/12/122

This function is not called under load, so it makes sense to out of line
it to get better register allocation in schedule() and make the assembler
easier to read.
