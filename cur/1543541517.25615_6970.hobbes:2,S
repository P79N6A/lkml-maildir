Urghh, I can't believe I didn't think of this... Indeed,
we want to support HFS, HPFS and the other filesystems
with extended attributes / resource forks well.

I can agree with this one. The behaviour of the file stays the
same as it is right now and we have an easy way of storing
extended attributes with the file.
It also solves the 'cp vs. xv' dilemma, which was my main
objection to the whole multi-fork issue. Of course this means
the extended attributes will get lost when the file is being
transfered with a tool which doesn't support extended attributes,
but the same happens today with normal attributes and tools not
supporting those...  (so that's pretty much a non-issue)

I'll trust you and Al Viro on this one ;)
