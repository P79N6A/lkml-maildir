Thank you for your care. What I am trying to do is to rewrite NFS in
the virtual machine environment so that network communication can be
replaced with inter-VM communication.
But after I remove the original rpc stuff, I ran into some strange
problem, including this one.  Interesting thing is that I noticed that
even with standard NFS implementation, it is still possible that
nfsd_read() return resp->count to be 0. At this time, eof is also
equal to 1. This seems to be right since NFSD already reach the end of
the file. But question is since 0 byte is read this time, NFS should
detect EOF in previous read. Why need one more read?
