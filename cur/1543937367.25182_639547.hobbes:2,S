Might be helpful to try with CONFIG_DEBUG_DRIVER=y and
CONFIG_KOBJECT_DEBUG=y to spot where a reference is not dropped.

sysfs_move_dir() does this (to avoid a loop later in the function).
Don't know if that's a good thing to check at a higher level as well,
because the calling code should really know where their devices are.
Anyway, if this "move in place" exposes a refcounting bug, we must fix
it.

Avoiding to move devices when there is nothing to be moved nevertheless
sounds like a good idea :)
