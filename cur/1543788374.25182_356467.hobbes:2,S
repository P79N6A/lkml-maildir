Hi Ingo,
   OK, after about an hour or moderately heavy usage while running
Jack - I've built a new new kernel, done an emerge sync and am in the
process of an emerge world right now (it's building glibc) along with
playing music and browsing the web - I just had my first xrun:
configuring for 44100Hz, period = 128 frames, buffer = 2 periods
nperiods = 2 for capture
nperiods = 2 for playback
08:51:42.919 Server configuration saved to "/home/mark/.jackdrc".
08:51:42.919 Statistics reset.
08:51:43.037 Client activated.
08:51:43.038 Audio connection change.
08:51:43.042 Audio connection graph change.
09:11:52.063 Audio connection graph change.
09:11:52.122 Audio connection change.
09:11:54.217 Audio connection graph change.
subgraph starting at qjackctl-8400 timed out (subgraph_wait_fd=17,
status = 0, state = Finished)
09:54:17.656 XRUN callback (1).
**** alsa_pcm: xrun of at least 4.351 msecs
So....how do I begin to find out what caused that, or will cause
similar xruns in the future?
Is it that rt priorities are not set up correctly? Or is it something else?
I must say that the kernel has really improved for me over the last
couple of weeks. This is great performance from where I was before I
joined the LKML. I think you guys are making good progress, most
especially for my AMD64 platform.
Thanks!
Cheers,
Mark
