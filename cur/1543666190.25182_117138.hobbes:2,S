New exports of 2.4 and 2.5 are up.  They should have more accurate 
users on the deltas.  Please take a look at a file you know you 
have modified and compare it the BK tree.  For example compare
cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@kernel.bkbits.net:/home/cvs rlog linux-2.5/Makefile
http://linux.bkbits.net:8080/linux-2.5/hist/Makefile
I think they are closer now, let me know if you find a bug.
I have the tarballs of the RCS files available as well, let me know if you
want them.
