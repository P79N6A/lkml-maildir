It's a fair argument that nVidia has significant IP in their video
drivers...  I understand that's where they get a fair amount of their
speed.
For a network driver, nVidia will have a really tough time convincing me
there is useful IP in their NIC driver, or the NIC itself :)  There are
much more advanced NICs out there (with public docs, no less)...
