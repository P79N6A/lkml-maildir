Sorry for linux.com, Ebay, etc. If they can not choose ISP it's their problem.
Even if my friend is very good guy I can not help him if he's doing stupid
things.

If above.net is filtering probes from ORBS *I* want it to be blocked. ORBS can
not magically install itself on host. It's sysadmin who choose if he want to
use ORBS or not. And if he choose to use it he want reliable information, of
course.

It's their choice. Then they will not be able to use linux-kernel and some
other mailing list, send mail to some peoples (more and more in time).

They blocked ORBS. It's enough. What they are saying is not relevant. What
they are doing IS relevant. ORBS does not send incorrect mails, it does not
send incorrect IP/TCP/whatever packets and it does not produce a lot of traffic.
The only reason to block ORBS is to make addition to ORBS's blacklist faster.
And if above.net wants to be blocked... They are blocked. What a problem ?
