	Hmmm...  You're lucky.  You have that option.  Because one of the
changes to the regs to "reduce" the complexity eliminated a reporting
exemption, we've had to change our reporting proceedures for crypto exports
at Internet Security Systems.  That had to be done immediately, since the
regs took effect immediately upon publication.  So we had a chinese
firedrill to try and get our reporting proceedures and record keeping
in line with the new regs.  That was the one spot that "inadvertantly"
got worse.  :-(

	I saw that...  Things like checking for .mil and .gov client sites.
How BOGUS!  Still, only applies to binaries and not to open source software
SOURCES but that's little solace since Linus said that you planned to
include some binaries on the site.
