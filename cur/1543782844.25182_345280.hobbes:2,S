The latter needs more than just locking fixes. Right now we have some
potentially _very_ interesting behaviour due to the fact that large
swathes of kernel code assume that a thread's privileges will not change
while it is inside a syscall.
This was something I started to try to address with the BSD credential
patches a couple of years ago, but I never managed to finish those in
time for 2.6.0.
