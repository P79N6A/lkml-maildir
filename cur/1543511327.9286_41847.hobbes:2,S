I have noticed the same thing.  In particular there are 8 LUNs for
each CD device.  I've seen it with different brands of CD drives
(HP, Philips, Hitachi(I think)).  Happens whether the device is
CDROM or CDRW.  I don't know any value to this behaviour.  But
it is awkward.  In each case have a CDROM and a CDRW on the same
IDE bus.  Each is running RH6.0 with kernel 2.2.10.  In each case
I have had to edit /dev/MAKEDEV to create more SCSI device nodes
because the default was only 8, and that only covered the first
CDROM.
