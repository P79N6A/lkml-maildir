pgoff describes a file offset in the same units used to map files
with (the size of an area covered by a PTE), which is PAGE_SIZE (in
mainline; elsewhere it's called MMUPAGE_SIZE and I had to fix this
already for my tree). When they differ this would lose the offset into
the PAGE_CACHE_SIZE-sized file page; hence, well-spotted.
