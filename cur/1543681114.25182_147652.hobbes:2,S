well, it's not an heuristic, it's a simplification and it will certainly
won't provide any benefit (besides saving some hundred kbytes of ram per
harddisk that is a minor benefit).

Important for latency or throughput? Do you know which is the benchmarks
that returned better results with the two queues, what's the theory
behind this?

Is it latency or throughput that you're mainly worried about? Latency
certainly isn't worse with this lowlatency improvement (no matter one or
two queues, that's a very minor issue w.r.t. to latency).
I could imagine readahead throughput could be less likely to be hurted
by writes with the two queue. But I doubt it's very noticeable.
However I'm not against re-adding it, clearly there's a slight benefit
for reads in never blocking in wait_for_request, I just didn't consider
it very worthwhile since they've to block anyways later normally for
batch_sectors anyways, just like every write (in a congested I/O
subsystem - when the I/O isn't congested nothing blocks in the first
place).
