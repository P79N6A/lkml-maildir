Only if someone tries to use it under a BSD license, strips off the GPL
notices, and then builds it against *Linux*. If linux-kernel is going to
be that fascist about licensing, let's please clean up all the binary
firmware blobs in header files first.
It seems reasonable to me that distribution and modification of the
*source code* can be under either license. But as soon as you build a
binary agaist the linux kernel, the binary is irrevocably GPL licensed.

Somone asked my why I work on this free (
http://www.fsf.org/philosophy/
)
software stuff and not get a real job. Charles Shultz had the best answer:
"Why do musicians compose symphonies and poets write poems? They do it
because life wouldn't have any meaning for them if they didn't. That's why
I draw cartoons. It's my life." -- Charles Shultz
