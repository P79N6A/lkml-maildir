Hi,
> I haven't encountered any CPU with builtin temperature sensors.
Well, I've got an Apple iMac (tee hee hee) with a PowerPC G3 (or 750 for you
number guys).  I know for sure that all of the G3 / G4 chips have
temperature sensors built onto the CPU core.
Mine's showing 23 degrees Celsius at the moment.
