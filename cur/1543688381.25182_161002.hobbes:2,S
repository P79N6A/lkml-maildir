the information is vague, because I don't exactly know how I manage
to stop the drive working.

hm, that's not so easy. I notice that the drive stops working, but
I can't exactly tell when. Unfortunately I can't give you the
partition table of the new drive anymore, because it's alread gone ;-)

well ... I would assume that a proper "emulation" of a harddisk by a
flashdrive would also look like a real harddisk, with correct
cylinder boundaries. But obviously, this is not the case. Should
I get a new drive, I will mail you the strange-looking partiotion-table:
it will look like "physical start at (0,3,3)" or similar.
