no, please let it there. This driver is the GPL'd part of the dbox2 
driver which is not part of the official kernel tree.
Since frontend and demod drivers are reusable elsewhere and mainstream 
hardware that makes use of this demodulator may show up every week it's 
just stupid to remove this code as long we know it is working and 
continously tested by the dbox2 folks.
Instead it may make sense to move the dbox2 sources into the mainstream 
source tree. Andreas, what do you think?
