I used to be a sw fill proponent, but I've grown personally convinced that 
while sw fill is good, it needs a few things:
 - large on-chip TLB to avoid excessive trashing (ie preferably thousands
   of entries)
   This implies that the TLB should be split into a L1 and a L2, for all 
   the same reasons you split other caches that way (and with the L1
   probably being duplicated among all memory units)
 - ability to fill multiple entries in one go to offset the cost of taking 
   the trap.
Without that kind of support, the flexibility advantages of a sw fill just 
isn't enough to offset the advantage you can get from doing it in 
hardware (mainly the ability to not have to break your pipeline).
An in-memory hash table can of course be that L2, but I have this strong
suspicion that a forward-looking chip engineer would just have put the L2
on the die and made it architecturally invisible (so that moore's law can
trivially make it bigger in years to come).
