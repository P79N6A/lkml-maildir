This has nothing to do with the kernel.
This only depends on your CPU and on the PCI-HOST bridge of your system.
For example, some (all?) Intel PCI-HOST bridges will translate a LOCK
prefixed memory READ to PCI into a locked PCI transaction. It is also
possible to perform a locked READ/MODIFY transaction to PCI using the
corresponding LOCK prefixed memory instruction.
I suggest you to download PCI-HOST bridge documents from Intel site and
to look into them, if obviously you are interestested in such hardware.
Just, PCI-to-PCI bridges do not carry the PCI LOCK# protocol. As a result
a subsystem relying on PCI LOCK# will not work (as expected) if PCI agents
are talking through a PCI-to-PCI bridge.
