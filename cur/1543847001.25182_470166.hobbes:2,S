Sorry for a long delay.
I'm actually not very interested in the Wireless Extension interface of
the driver.  The less I touch that code, the better I feel.  I won't add
to the criticism for the latest changes; enough has been said.
Its fine with me that your are changing the orinoco driver to update
Wireless Extensions compatibility.
I'm trying to maintain a Subversion repository with the driver modified
to be compatible with a few latest kernels.  But it looks like it's an
uphill battle that I'm not going to win.
