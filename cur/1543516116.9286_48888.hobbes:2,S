You're free to go ahead with your plan and distribute
splitted kernel trees. I'd even be willing to give you 
folks disk space and bandwidth for it.
However, I still think this would be a pointless excercise.
Do you have any idea on how to split things up for
distributing? Which files should be included with what
kernel set, etc...?
If you think about it some more (off-list, please), then
you'll shortly come to the conclusion that the whole idea
is a can of worms you wish you'd have never opened.
I would still like to see you try it, though :)
