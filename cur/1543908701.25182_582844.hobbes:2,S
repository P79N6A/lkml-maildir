I would wait to see the references before doing such presumptions..
AFAIK, powerpc does not suffer from such problems. I have also seen
nothing of this kind about AMD processors, so it seems to be Intel
specific.

Yes, this errata can be found starting at the Pentium III (as explained
in my patch). Can you elaborate a little more on the differences ? From
what I have seem, the basic problem is always the same from PIII to
core2 Duo: instruction prefetch.

You seem to be pointing out to a lot of erratas, when there is, from
what I reckon, only one (basically the same) from PIII to Core 2 Duo,
which is Intel specific. I have looked around and ia64 also seems to be
affected by this. Can you point us out to other documentation sources
please ?
