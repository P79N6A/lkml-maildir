As nice as a free, open source, patent-unencumbered replacement for RSA
would be, some caution is called for. It would be prudent to wait until
the system has been subjected to some rigorous crytanalysis first, lest we
discover six moths after adopting it that it can be trivially broken with
pencil and paper.
