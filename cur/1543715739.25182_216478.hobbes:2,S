Several drivers already use the firmware loading facility and I expect seeing
more of them in the future. So it is possible to have 2 seperate devices
request firmware at the same time. If we just provide single dummy device and
use it they will clash. Generating unique ID on every request with empty
device is a hack. I do not think that interface needs this kind of a hack, it
is better to keep them in the drivers that do not properly register themselves
with the driver model yet.
