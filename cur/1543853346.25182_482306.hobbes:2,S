well, I did it accidentally :) (forgot to plug in power and after 2 hours on 
battery notebook simply switched off) and yes, there was some noticeable 
delay loading grub. I also tried fs freezer without any visible effect. The 
patches from mm I applied to vanilla kernel:
add-include-linux-freezerh-and-move-definitions-from.patch
swsusp-cleanup-whitespace-in-freezer-output.patch
swsusp-freeze-filesystems-during-suspend-rev-2.patch
swsusp-thaw-userspace-and-kernel-space-separately.patch
Do I need some more patches for this to work?
