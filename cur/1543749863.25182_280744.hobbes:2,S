It's if the network card will check the checksums of the packets on
receiving. If it doesn't, the main CPU needs to read every byte in the
packet to calculate the checksum itself. If the CPU is doing that
anyway you can copy it elsewhere for free. 
Generally, reading from memory takes time because the CPU has to wait,
writing is free since it can be deferred in the cache (in theory
indefinitly) until there's free cycle.
In other words, if the card isn't checksumming but does DMA you're not
really saving any time over a manual copy.
Hope this helps,
