Looking at fsnotify_access() I think we could hit the same scenario.
Are you proposing we alter any appliction where multiple threads read
a single data file to first make a hard link to that data file and each
read from their private copy?  I don't think that is a very reasonable
suggestion.
Let me reiterate, I know _VERY_ little about filesystems.  Can the
dentry->d_lock be changed to a read/write lock?
Thanks,
Robin
