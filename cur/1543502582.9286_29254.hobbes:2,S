I completely agree.  I have just recently started looking at the kernel
itself, and two of my eventual tasks were to implement proper POSIX
signal handling for threads and to do PCS threads (either the easy way
in-kernel or using scheduler activations).  My only attempt at this to
date was on the signal part, and it didn't work -- I'm still trying to
figure out why adding a member to the task_struct keeps the kernel from
booting even when I don't even use that member anywhere in the source.
