Ahh, that would not work either. The description of master/guest was
probably not the best: The protocolbytes from the guest do not even
reach the KBC because the master (touchpad) is ignoring them. So as soon
the guest accepts an protocol more advanced than ps/2 the master must be
told how many bytes is used in the protocol.
