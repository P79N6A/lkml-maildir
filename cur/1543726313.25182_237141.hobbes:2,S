I had no time to do a lot of testing, but it seems that binutils 2.15 +
gcc 3.3.3 is a bad one too. I didn't try to compile the kernel (which
may also break), but at least I couldn't compile gcc 3.4.1 with the
above combination. It seems that as doesn't get the -mxxx parameter
required to compile altivec stuff. Hacking the Makefile to make it
pass -Wa,-m7455 helped a little, but it eventually failed in another
weird way. I hadn't time to investigate further, sorry.
