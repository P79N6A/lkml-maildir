I also am seeing this problem--it is definitely pts related.  I have
noticed that when the problem occurs, if I execute "gnome-terminal &"
from an existing gnome-terminal, a new window comes up, but input and
output from the new shell are still going to the prior gnome-terminal.
'ps' shows both the new gnome-terminal and old gnome-terminal on the
same pts.  But sometimes everything works fine.
Cheers, Wayne
