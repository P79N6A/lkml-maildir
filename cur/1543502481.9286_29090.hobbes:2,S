It really screws up other devices sharing the interrupt -- which is all
the more likely with PCI, which has only 4 interrupt lines per bus.
As a matter of principle all interrupts are supposed to be acknowleged
by telling the device it can finish asserting the irq -- for this, you
need a device-specific interrupt handler.  It can be very small but
you do need it.

Now admittedly it would be very cool if user-space video drivers could
do this.  Perhaps a generic user-interrupt driver where you give it the
I/O or memory location to check (for valid interrupt) and the I/O or
memory location & mask & value to write to acknowlege the interrupt.
I would imagine most devices fit that pattern.
