Something really odd just happened. I was on console,
and hit alt-f7, which flipped me back to X.
There were small blinking parts of the screen, which
I think was actually the fb cursor, but it was sort of skewed
across the screen. I could click in windows, but when
I typed, nothing would appear. I pressed alt-ctrl-f1,
and got back to the console, where everything I had just
typed (whilst I thought I was in X) was.
Totally wierd, and try as I might, I can't reproduce it at will.
Nvidia graphic card (no binary crap loaded), vesafb.
