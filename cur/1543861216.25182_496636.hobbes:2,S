Subject: [GIT PATCH] USB fixes for 2.6.20-rc3
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Here are some USB fixes for 2.6.20-rc3
They include:
	- more quirks for usbstorage and printer devices
	- minor bugfixes
They have all been in the -mm tree for a while.
The gadget driver update looks big, but David says it fixes a number of
problems with it, and it's self-contained.
Please pull from:
	master.kernel.org:/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/usb-2.6.git/
The full patches will be sent to the linux-usb-devel mailing list, if
anyone wants to see them.
thanks,
greg k-h
