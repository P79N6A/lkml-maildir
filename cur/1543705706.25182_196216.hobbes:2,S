Yes.

Coding style compliance, reduction of ifdefs, etc.  Reduction of patch
footprint.  There are a few features in the patch in -mm which I am not
aware of anyone having used.

People have added timestamping infrastructure, stack overflow testing and
inbuilt assertion frameworks to various gdb stubs at various times.  We
need to take a look at such things and really convice ourselves that
