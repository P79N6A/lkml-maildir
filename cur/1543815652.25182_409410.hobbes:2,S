Mmmm, somthing strange is in this kernel. Is hangs the box in the middle
of the night, it looks like it got stuck on the scsi disk on an AHC
controller...I get no info on syslog.
Are there any changes in aic drivers ? It also has a raid array, perhaps
some change in md code is borking when cron jobs are run in the night...
