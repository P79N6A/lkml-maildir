I think the problem is that the CardBus bridge setup code in 2.4 only
allocates 256 bytes of IO space, total, per socket, and this card
requires two 256-byte IO windows, one for each device.  So the
allocation for resource 0 for the second device (the modem) fails.
I tried poking around to figure out where this is set but I couldn't
find it.  Martin probably knows exactly where to look.
Hmmm.  Actually, now that I think about it, maybe this is not so easy
as bumping a limit up from 0x100 to 0x200.  The IO port allocation
code in 2.4 assumes that the only safe IO port regions for PCI devices
are 0x400-0x4ff, 0x800-0x8ff, 0xa00-0x8ff, etc.  A card like this that
needs >256 ports will need to have them split up into non-contiguous
pieces.  However, the resource manager expects a PCI bus to have a
single parent IO resource that can get cut up in any arbitrary way.
The standalone PCMCIA drivers allocate IO ports a bit differently and
don't have this particular limitation.
