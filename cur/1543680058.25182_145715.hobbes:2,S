I am seeing these D tasks when running 2.5.74-mm2 under a heavy seeking
load (compiling application, untarring kernel, and filesharing
simultaneously) on a slow (laptop 4200RPM) hdd.  I find that after about
10 uptime when I start throwing on the seeking loads one or all of them
go to D state and any new disk IO is either blocked or very slow.
I have tested with elevator=deadline and have been unable to reproduce.
Any further testing or debugging you need me to do I can probably do
(but I'm not terribly knowledgable so I'll need step by step for said
testing).  Thanks!
