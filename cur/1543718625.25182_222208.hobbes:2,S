Have you heard of wait, waitpid and pthread_join?

Your 255 thread limit is propably because you have a stack size of 8192 
kbytes. (see ulimit). As all threads share the same address space, this 
address space is the limiting factor. Try ulimit -s 1024 for example.

Well, the other way around is the correct answer. Processes didnt get 
slower. Threads are faster than processes in 2.6 because of the NPTL. If 
you want to slow down threads to process level, just do 
LD_ASSUME_KERNEL=2.2.5 before running your test program.
