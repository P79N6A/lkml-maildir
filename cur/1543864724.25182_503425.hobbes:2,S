That shouldn't be a problem.  I would consider this to be "one large 
application" consisting of multiple SPU binaries running simultaneously. 
  Such a scenario can be handled with no negative performance impact 
using a simple 16 element array of cached_info objects -- as long as 
there isn't (much) SPU task switching being done.
