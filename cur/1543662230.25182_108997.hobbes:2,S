Hi,
	Current 2.5.60 has code which disables TSC access for tasks 
running in lower privelege level than ring0 when disabling kernel TSC 
usage. Doing a read, modify, write with only the TSD bit being set causes 
it to report a monitor error. This happens before console_init so it hangs 
on 'Uncompressing Linux... Ok booting the kernel'
To reproduce, build a 2.5.60 i586+ kernel and boot with notsc.
if (tsc_disable && cpu_has_tsc) {
	printk(KERN_NOTICE "Disabling TSC...\n");
	/**** FIX-HPA: DOES THIS REALLY BELONG HERE? ****/
	clear_bit(X86_FEATURE_TSC, boot_cpu_data.x86_capability);
	set_in_cr4(X86_CR4_TSD);
}
This isn't a bug report, just an FYI for people using VMWare, and the TSC 
in vmware does work.
	Zwane
