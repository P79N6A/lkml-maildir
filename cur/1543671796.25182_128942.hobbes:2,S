Well I asked my CPU to double check. If I got the code right it thinks that
ffs(i^(i-1))==fls(i) is true for 1->2^32-1
If you think about it it seems to make sense
	x-1 turns the lowest 100..0 sequence into 01......1
	The xor removes unchanged higher bits
	so 
		10100
         -1     10011
	XOR	00111
