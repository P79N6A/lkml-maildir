Hello
I have a question about LILO. I'm aware that this list is for
kernel-related discussion, but LILO does load the kernel after all.
I plan to install Red Hat Linux 5.1 (with kernel 2.1.105 or later) on my
system. I am currently running NT Workstation 4.0 with OS loader 4.01.
My HD is partitioned into a FAT16 partition and a NTFS partition.
What I need to know is if LILo will boot the NT kernel the same way it
boots the Linux and Windows 95 kernels. Otherwise, my system will get a
major screwing-over. Has anyone else tried this and been successful? Or
is NT's boot code too stubborn for LILO to load?
Thanks
