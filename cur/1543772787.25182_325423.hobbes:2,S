Bear in mind that after one minute, all of vi's text may have been
reclaimed from pagecache, so the above would have to do a lot of randomish
reads to reload vi into memory.  Try reducing the sleep interval a lot.

Don't know.  Try to work out (from vmstat or diskstats) how much reading is
going on.
Try stracing the check, see if your version of vi is doing a sync() or
something odd like that.

OK, well if the latency is mainly due to reads then one would hope that the
anticipatory scheduler would do better than that.
But what happened to this, from your first report?

Are you able to reproduce that 5-minute stall in the more recent testing?
