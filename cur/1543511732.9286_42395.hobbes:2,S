Ah, but devfs *does* cure the disease.  (It has the distinction of
being the only such cure so far, not counting vaporware.)  If used in
no-compatibility mode, it can dynamically assign 32-bit device numbers,
without any major/minor split.  Are you suggesting that someone out
there has need for more than 1<<32 device nodes?
And before you complain that this breaks compatibility with someone
(LILO and rdev need to be taught not to hardcode root dev numbers in),
remember that a bigger kdev_t carries the same disadvantage.
