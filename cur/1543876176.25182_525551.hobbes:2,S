I have now even better one with pata_via.  A kernel, which for
all practical purposes is 2.6.21-rc5, not only refuses to boot
(and I cannot find some option combination which would allow me to
do so anyway) but simply refuses to read _any_ data from a media.
This included a partitioning information.
Earlier kernel on the same hardware boots without raising any fuss.
