doesn't work. This was my first attempt. Seems that the pci_save_state, 
pci_disable device is really needed.

I also thought about that, however I tried to let e1000_suspend call 
e1000_down everytime, as that calls e1000_irq_disable and free_irq. Than call 
e1000_up in resume, as that does  request_irq e1000_irq_enable. 
This does not work, though. Still no irqs
