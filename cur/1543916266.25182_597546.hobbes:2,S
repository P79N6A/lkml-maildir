If you do a synchronize_rcu() it might well have to wait through the
following sequence of states:
Stage 0: (might have to wait through part of this to get out of "next" queue)
	rcu_try_flip_idle_state,	/* "I" */
	rcu_try_flip_waitack_state, 	/* "A" */
	rcu_try_flip_waitzero_state,	/* "Z" */
	rcu_try_flip_waitmb_state	/* "M" */
Stage 1:
	rcu_try_flip_idle_state,	/* "I" */
	rcu_try_flip_waitack_state, 	/* "A" */
	rcu_try_flip_waitzero_state,	/* "Z" */
	rcu_try_flip_waitmb_state	/* "M" */
Stage 2:
	rcu_try_flip_idle_state,	/* "I" */
	rcu_try_flip_waitack_state, 	/* "A" */
	rcu_try_flip_waitzero_state,	/* "Z" */
	rcu_try_flip_waitmb_state	/* "M" */
Stage 3:
	rcu_try_flip_idle_state,	/* "I" */
	rcu_try_flip_waitack_state, 	/* "A" */
	rcu_try_flip_waitzero_state,	/* "Z" */
	rcu_try_flip_waitmb_state	/* "M" */
Stage 4:
	rcu_try_flip_idle_state,	/* "I" */
	rcu_try_flip_waitack_state, 	/* "A" */
	rcu_try_flip_waitzero_state,	/* "Z" */
	rcu_try_flip_waitmb_state	/* "M" */
So yes, grace periods do indeed have some latency.

Ah!!!  Good point, #define does make sense here.

The current code absolutely must exclude the scheduling-clock hardirq

Somewhere in the range from 64 to a few hundred CPUs, the global lock
protecting the try_flip state machine would start sucking air pretty
badly.  But the real problem is synchronize_sched(), which loops through
all the CPUs --  this would likely cause problems at a few tens of
CPUs, perhaps as early as 10-20.
