Does it actually switches away from X ?
IE. You see the console before the crap on console or not ?
I've seen what you describe happening when doing snooze -f (direct
kernel ioctl) straight from within X. It seems to me that the problem
was that for some reason it didn't switch the console, which would
definitely make it crash. I need to double check what's up, it's
possible that the kernel fails to switch it properly or fails to wait
for X to ack the switch.
In any case, I doesn't seem to be directly related to those radeonfb
changes, though a clash with X like that is indeed more likely to
actually happen if radeonfb relies more heavily on acceleration.
I'll have a look later today at the console switch from X in the kernel
see if it's been broken in a way or another.
Note: I just did some tests using both echo "mem" >/sys/power/state and
snooze -f and it worked fine. IE, the console switch away from X worked.
So while I think I observed your problem once, I also cannot reproduce
it now.
I wonder if there's a race condition in the VT switch. It's possible
that it could be yet another case of X whacking the chip after it has
effectively relinguished control of the VT to the kernel, or it could be
a kernel race.
Cheers,
Ben.
