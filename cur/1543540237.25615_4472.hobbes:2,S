This is incorrect. Windows NT 4.0 ACLS do allow giving anyone ownership
of a resource, for example a file. This is not available through
Explorer, but can be done using the Security API.
Another issue, I believe might be of more importance, the implementation
of ACLs so that they can be applied to other securable objects including
printers, processes, etc. 
The model discussed earlier is quite FS specific.
