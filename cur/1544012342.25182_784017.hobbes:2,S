I just upgraded from 2.6.27.8 or .10 to 2.6.28 on several machines.  On
one, a Dell dimension 3000 with a dual-core pentium R chip,  2 Seagate
ST340014A (/dev/hda with swap as partion 1 and root ext3 filesystem as
partion 2 and b containing a windows partition) and running slackware
12.1, I get a kernel panic when trying to boot (the others boot fine);
specifically, I get:
        Cannot open root device "302" or unknown block(3,2).  Please
        append a correct root=; here are the available partitions:
No partitions are shown.  Manually adding root=/dev/hda2 to the lilo
boot prompt doesn't help either.
The 2.6.27.8 kernel boots fine.
Any suggestions?  Please CC me directly.
Thanks and Happy Holidays
