Actually it doesn't.  We do not call down into the filesystem
for I_DIRTY_PAGES.
set_page_dirty() is already called under locks, via __free_pte (pagetable
teardown).  2.4 does this as well.
But I'll make the change anyway.  I think it removes any
ranking requirements between mapping->page_lock and 
mapping->private_lock, which is always a nice thing.
