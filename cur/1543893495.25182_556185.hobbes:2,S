gcc will trim a long to an integer correctly.  You can pass a long to
an integer without casting.

No it won't.  UML builds without warnings here on x86_64.

The GCC guarantee I'm talking about it LP64 - I'm highly confident
that's not changing any time soon.

What warnings does this produce?  These are the same sizes as x86_64
(and every other 64-bit arch that Linux runs on, I bet), where this
code compiles without warning.

It's not the runtime cost - it's the extra code.

You haven't demonstrated any safety or portability problems yet.
