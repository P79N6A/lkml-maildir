Sorry no. system.h is the header from hell and putting it into a "basic" header
like atomic_t will likely cause all kinds of problems.
If it's a real issue move cmpxchhg into a different header and include that
from system.h and atomic.h. system.h has too much stuff anyways so it could
use any cleanup.
