Greg, Please find attached the reworked-patch. I have gotten rid of
CONFIG_RESOURCES_32BIT and instead introduced CONFIG_RESOURCES_64BIT in 
arch intenepndent file mm/Kconfig.
This patch assumes that 64bit kernels will define CONFIG_64BIT. All the
architectures seems to be adhering to this but can't find CONFIG_64BIT for 
sh64. Don't know much about this arch.
o Introuces CONFIG_RESOURCES_64BIT Kconfig option.
o This option is available only for 32bit platforms/kernels (!CONFIG_64BIT),
  as for 64bit kernels, resources have to be 64 bits and they already
  are.
