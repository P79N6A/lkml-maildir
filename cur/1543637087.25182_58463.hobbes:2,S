These patches don't make any sense.
You aren't blocking against other things that cli/sti used
to disable, namely timers and the generic input packet processing
engine.
There is no way these changes are a correct replacement for cli/sti.
This goes for your IPX changes too which I ask that you had pass
through Arnaldo de Melo in the future as he has done a lot of work
in this area.
