This is a known recurring bug in Mandrake's kernel packaging. It's not a
core kernel issue, so this is more appropriate on a Mandrake mailing
list. A quick google search brings up a message from the cooker list
that says this was fixed in -22mdk. You should get that kernel and use
it instead; if it doesn't work, bug Mandrake, since it's their problem.
(ALSA isn't even part of 2.4 mainline.)
