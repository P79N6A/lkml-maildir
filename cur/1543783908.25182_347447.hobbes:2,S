The defines above certainly have no problems.  They want to wait for
multiples of seconds.

100/100 == 1.  As far as my limited math skills go, only 0 divided by
something can give a result of zero ;)
So yes, the code would poll every 1/100th of a second, even with HZ=100.  
Obviously, if HZ would ever go below 100, the code above would provide
some problems.  I'm not sure what the future plans with HZ are, but I'll
add an #error statement in case HZ goes smaller than that.
