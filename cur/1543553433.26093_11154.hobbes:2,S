It demonstrates nothing except bad code. Anybody should know that
such a descriptor can become writable at any instant, simply because
the kernel may be finding room for more unread data.
So, the code sees that, at this instant, it's not writable. Then
it writes to it anyway. Sometimes the fd becomes writable between
the time that it was checked, and the time it was written. So
the write succeeded. So what. It shows nothing but bad code. It
demonstrates no bug whatsover.
There may be a bug. However, this code doesn't demonstrate anything
but bad coding practice.
