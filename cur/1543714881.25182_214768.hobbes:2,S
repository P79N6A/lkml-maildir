According to Documentation/nfsroot.txt you should be able
to do:
root=/dev/nfs ip=rarp nfsroot=/kernel,tcp,v3
i.e. the ip is optional. Just out of curiosity: How would you
supply the kernel name using rarp/bootp/dhcp? Since a few days
I'm using pxelinux but before that I needed to hardcode the
path into the tagged image. Actually I prefer this to restarting
the restarting the dhcp server, but...
