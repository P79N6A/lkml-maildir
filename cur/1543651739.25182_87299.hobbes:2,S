Good.  I'm beginning to feel better already.

I'm beginning to relize this.  Just a bit thick skulled at the moment.

That was a cheep shot on my part.  But one thing that sets Linux apart from, 
say, FreeBSD, is that linux tends to have all of the features that USERS 
want.  I'm able to use my linux box as a firewall, IDS, DBMS, file server... 
etc.  But my AIX friends keep pointing at Volume Management and saying, "you 
can't do this...."  And indeed, with LVM, I couldn't when I tried.  I once 
lost a 360Gb database because I tried to resize it.  So call me sensitve.

I'm beginning to see some logic to this.  Remember, I've only been thinking 
about this for a few hours.  It sounds like the EVMS team has been thinking 
about it for quite some time.  I may have over-reacted.
