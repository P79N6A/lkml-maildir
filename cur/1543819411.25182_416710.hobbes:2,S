Sendmail with POSIX Capabilities works great
on Irix, which is the system it was developed
for. Irix, unlike Linux, supports (but, in
keeping with IEEE rules does not claim to
conform to) the POSIX Capabilities exec(2)
symantics. The sendmail work was done in
anticipation of Linux supporting Posix
Capabilities. Alas, the xattr work on Linux
was not done before the Company The Built Irix
ran out of money to spend on security* and
the push to get capabilities working right
never materialized. Sorry.
