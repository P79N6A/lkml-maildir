Hello,
The following definition in linux/include/ip.h is creating problems.
How does Endianness affect BIT ORDER 
IT affetc only  BYTE ORDER
------------------------------------------------------------------------
struct iphdr {
#if defined(__LITTLE_ENDIAN_BITFIELD)
        __u8    ihl:4,
                version:4;
#elif defined (__BIG_ENDIAN_BITFIELD)
        __u8    version:4,
                ihl:4;
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here I have a network device which works on both little endian and big
endian machines.
I found out that the driver of the device was saying unrecognizable
packet when i assign
strcut iphdr *ip;
ip->version=4
ip->ihl=5
on bigendian machines.
It is because the two fields are swapped and start of the iphdr is 5
instead of 4.
The device is seeing 5 at the version and saying neither ipv4 nor ipv6
packet found.
I had to do the following to remove the error
*((unsigned char*)ip) = 0x45;
Had anyone noticed IT
