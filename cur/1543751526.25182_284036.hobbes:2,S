After reading this again when I /wasn't/ semi-comatose, I retract my 
statement insofar as it wouldn't help you (but I think it's still rather 
necessary) :)
The system did exactly what I'm talking about (which it didn't do for 
me, possibly because the board/processor didn't support APIC).  I guess 
my question to you is:  do you have other devices sharing this 
interrupt?  In other words, are you /sure/ that it's the adaptec 
controller which is setting the interrupt line high?
