There is a bit more clarity on the performance degradation
issue now - In fact the degradation only appears when
using iptables. It's just that sometime shortly after 2.4.2,
the hit imposed by iptables got worse.
For instance:
netperf results  without iptables       with iptables
-----------------------------------------------------------------
2.4.2                 400 MB/s                      330 MB/s
2.4.3-ac10            400 MB/s                      250 MB/s
BTW, the stock seawolf kernel gets the highest netperf
results ever seen on this box, around 450 MB/sec,
but with iptables or ipchains module loaded, it falls to
about 270 MB/sec.
Just a data point fyi -
