I can probably imagine a situation where the pathname resolution
would never finish, but I am not sure that it could ever happen
in nature.

Server bug or not, it is something that the client has to live
with.  We can't get the server file system fixed, so it is
something that we should find a way to live with.  This support
can help.

I created a bunch of use cases in the gensyscall.c program that
I attached to the original description of the problem and my
proposed solution.  It was very useful in generating many, many
ESTALE errors over the wire from a variety of different over the
wire operations, which were originally getting returned to the
user level.

Why do you think that it is an error?
It can easily occur if the directory in which the new directory
is to be created disppears after it is looked up and before the
MKDIR is issued.
The recovery is to perform the lookup again.

Could you outline some of these corner cases that this proposal
would not address, please?
I ran the test program for many hours, against several different
servers, and although I can't prove completeness, was not able to
show any ESTALE errors being returned unexpectedly.
    Thanx...
