Hm, as I'm not a SELinux developer, I can't tell you how many different
syscalls they need, or what they are for, sorry.
But this will require every security module project to petition for a
syscall, which would be a pain, and is the whole point of having this
sys_security call.

How would they be done differently now?  Multiple different syscalls?
I do know that Dave Miller has also complained about the sys_security
call in the past, and the difficulties along the same lines as the
ioctl 32bit problem.  If we were to go to individual syscalls for every
security function, this would go away.
In the end, it's Linus's call.
