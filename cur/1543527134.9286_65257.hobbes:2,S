Oh, I see. We are talking about different things. Yes, if all your
tests produce 1 or zero, parallel (bitwise) evaluation of all the
terms in a disjunction might well be faster than (on average)
lazily evaluating half of them in order before coming up trumps.
However, in my opinion that should be left to the optimizer to decide.
Or just possibly C is missing a boolean type.
