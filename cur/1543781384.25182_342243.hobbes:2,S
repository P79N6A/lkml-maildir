Haven't attempted to reproduce - I actually tried the kernel against my better 
judgement -- I've had hard-drives killed by faulty kernels in the past. But 
since you've requested, yes, I'll give it a shot. Reproducing it with an 
untainted kernel should be as simple as just booting the system, but I'm 
going to have to go monkey my init scripts to disable the automagic loading 
of the modules that taint the kernel.
As for doing it using a network or serial console - I don't have the equipment 
anymore. I used to have a decent WYSE serial console, but that died in the 
same storm that caught my old system... If you know where I can pick up an 
old line printer or a cheap serial terminal I'll buy it and get it setup 
ASAP.
