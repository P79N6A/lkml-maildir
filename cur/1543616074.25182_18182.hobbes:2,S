Subject: IDE command queueing.
Greetings from New Zealand.
to cut to the chase, I just though I'd point out:
http://www.storagereview.com/jive/sr/thread.jsp?forum=5&thread=20936
most specifically, the mention of some IBM IDE drives doing command queing.
I'm sure you know about this (much more than I do), however I was wondering 
if the current linux IDE implementation can take advantage of this? 
I'm a VERY strong proponent of both IDE and Linux, which as I'm sure you know 
is an up hill battle against many SCSI bigots.. Many of them can't see beyond 
the $ signs that they think mean SCSI must be better.
I'm truly impressed with the latest 2.4 kernels, and have seen some major 
performance improvements under IDE, but I am hoping for more.
I find it interesting that such sited as storage review only do windows 
testing, even for 'server' products, completely ignoring the fact that the 
host OS can have a major effect on driver performance, and that windows is 
not nescessarily the best in these cases.
Anyway, I hope perhaps there is something usefull to you in the above link.
Regards,
Stuart.
