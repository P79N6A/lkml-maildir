It has been pointed out to you at least once that it would stand a much
better chance if you were to follow the kernel coding style, for one ...
And things like :
+#ifndef CONFIG_SMP /* On an SMP machine NMIs are used to implement a watchdog and will hang
+                      the machine if traced. */
+        TRACE_TRAP_ENTRY(2, regs->eip);
+#endif
+
aren't very encouraging.
just my 2p
