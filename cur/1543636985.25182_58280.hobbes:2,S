i actually had something much more drastic in mind! :-) Now that the
global IRQ lock is no more, there's no 'local' and 'global' distinction
anymore between various irq disabling mechanizms.
So what i did in my tree was to introduce the following 5 core means of
manipulating the local interrupt flags:
	irq_off()
	irq_on()
	irq_save(flags)
	irq_save_off(flags)
	irq_restore(flags)
the equivalencies are:
	local_irq_save(flags)	 == irq_save_off(flags)
	local_irq_restore(flags) == irq_restore(flags)
	local_irq_disable()	 == irq_off()
	local_irq_enable()	 == irq_on()
	__cli()			 == irq_off()
	__sti()			 == irq_on()
	__save_flags(flags)	 == irq_save(flags)
	__restore_flags(flags)	 == irq_restore(flags)
	__save_and_cli(flags)	 == irq_save_off(flags)
the advantages this rename has:
- consistency - no dual naming for the same thing, we had 9 names for 5 
  entities.
- __cli, __sti are based on similarly named x86 instruction names which
  are often named differently on other architectures. 'irq_off()' and
  'irq_on()' on the other hand is a generic description. Also, cli and sti 
  are more cryptic than need to be.
- the names are actually shorter, more compact, making the source easier
  to read and understand.
- there's no conceptual confusion between local_irq_disable() and
  irq_disable(), or local_irq_enable() and irq_enable(), which are a
  completely separate set of APIs.
- there's no local_ prefix either - we know that interrupts can only be
  disabled locally.
- the confusion wrt. local_irq_save() is fixed too. local_irq_save() used
  to disable interrupt, although intuition tells that it saves flags only.
- the 5 new names do not create any namespace collision either.
some of these advantages are pretty 'small' in scope - but they all add
up. So in my opinion this is something we should do.
to ease the decision further, here's a patch against Linus' latest BK tree
that does all of this, in the whole kernel tree, for every architecture
and driver:
  
http://redhat.com/~mingo/remove-irqlock-patches/cli-sti-cleanup-2.5.27-A2
(the patch also cleans up every architecture's include/asm/system.h's irq
macros.)
the patch shaves off a total of 4 KB from the kernel source code size. It
compiles, boots & works just fine on x86 UP and SMP.
