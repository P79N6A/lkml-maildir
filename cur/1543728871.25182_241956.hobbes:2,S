Subject: PATCH [0/7] Fix posix locking code
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

The following patches fix up a number of inconsistencies within
the current VFS locking code.
The main problems addressed are
  - Inconsistent definition of what the lock owner means.
  	Currently, the VFS code is sometimes using current->files,
	sometimes current->tgid, and sometimes a combination of both.
    It turns out that CLONE_FILES more or less forces us to use
    current->files as the basis for the lock owner (or bad things
    will happen) so we must drop the checks for current->tgid.
  - Design worries: separate out callbacks used by lock managers,
    such as lockd, and those used by filesystems.
  - posix_lock_file() is called by the VFS *AFTER* the filesystem
    has been notified. However because it uses no locking, and
    may even sleep, there are serious race issues.
    By moving the posix_lock_file() call into the filesystem
    callback, the filesystem may implement its own locking scheme
    to avoid trouble.
Cheers,
  Trond
