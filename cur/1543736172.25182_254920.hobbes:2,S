Hi again, Donald-
Note:  I haven't forgotten your other question.
Is is still a problem?

That clearly shouldn't be happening, and that symbol isn't in
snull.o when I build it (on x86).

How did you build snull (or all of the LDD drivers)?
What command(s)?

So the problem machine is an sh-arch machine?
Maybe gcc 3.0.3 has some problem on sh.
Can you try this on some other architecture machine?

Seeing an objdump of that function (snull_hw_tx) should/could be helpful.

|     357     }
| (which seems to  be okey)
Yes.
