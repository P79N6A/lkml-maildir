Yes.  The special thing about X (and XMMS, XINE, et al) is that the 
interactivity heuristic fails in a user-noticeable way.  The heuristic must 
also be guessing incorrectly in other situations, but nobody seems to have 
noticed when it did (or, at least, complained about it).
Another noteworthy attribute of these programs is that they _know_ they will 
be used interactively.  And, if there were a way for them to convey that 
information to the kernel (not by using 'nice'), I bet all of the above 
projects would take advantage of that mechanism.
At first I strongly dissaproved of the kernel's timeslice adjustment by 
interactivity estimation; policy belongs in userland, I thought.  But the 
algorithm is actually quite effective -- a balance between high HZ for 
real-time-ish applications but manages to avoid the cache-thrashing in places 
it would hurt.  This policy works well most of the time, so the kernel 
includes it as a sensible default.  But X demonstrates that sometimes we want 
to set a different policy.  After all, the heuristic will not become perfect, 
and its worst-case behavior is pretty bad.  (If your computers are too fast 
to notice, try turning off cache with /proc/mtrr.  Not be a great idea on an 
important system though...)
The question is: what interface would be used?  A new syscall seems excessive; 
but something in /proc (/proc/xyz/preferred_timeslice ?) is non-optimal, 
because it must not be used in chroot.  I am not qualified to suggest the 
Proper mechanism, but I strongly believe there should be one.
