But 2.4 already inlines the usercopy functions.   With this benchmark,
the cost of the function call is visible.   Same with the dir_rtn_1
test - it is performing zillions of 3, 7, 10-byte copies into userspace.
The usercopy functions got themselves optimised for large copies and
cache footprint.  Maybe we should inline them again.  Maybe it doesn't
matter much.

We'd buy a bit by arranging for the in-kernel copy of the fp state
to have the same layout as the hardware.  That way it can be done in
a single big, fast, well-aligned slurp.  But for some reason that code has
to convert into and out of a different representation.
But the real low-hanging fruit here is the observation that the
test application doesn't use floating point!!!
Maybe we need to take an fp trap now and then to "poll" the application
to see if it is still using float.
