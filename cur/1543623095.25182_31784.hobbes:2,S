Hi
 there is a problem compiling lvm and raid modules ( either as module or internal to kernel )
for kernel version 2.5.5
 the error is as follows
lvm.c:240: warning: `struct bio' declared inside parameter list
lvm.c:240: warning: its scope is only this definition or declaration, which is probably not what you want.
lvm.c:266: warning: `struct bio' declared inside parameter list
lvm.c:272: parse error before `userlv_t'
lvm.c:273: parse error before `userlv_t'
lvm.c:275: parse error before `userlv_t'
lvm.c:295: warning: `struct bio' declared inside parameter list
lvm.c:311: parse error before `LVM_RELEASE_NAME'
lvm.c:363: unknown field `owner' specified in initializer
lvm.c:363: warning: initialization from incompatible pointer type
lvm.c:364: field `open' already initialized
lvm.c:365: field `release' already initialized
lvm.c:365: warning: initialization from incompatible pointer type
lvm.c:366: field `ioctl' already initialized
--- snipped ----
However older ( k 2.4.7-10) lvm compiles fine except that i am not able to load it into the kernel at runtime ( version mismatch and if i do a force insmod then it shows unresolved symbol
lvm.o: unresolved symbol lvm_hash_link
lvm.o: unresolved symbol lvm_snapshot_fill_COW_page
lvm.o: unresolved symbol lvm_snapshot_alloc
lvm.o: unresolved symbol lvm_drop_snapshot
lvm.o: unresolved symbol lvm_init_fs
lvm.o: unresolved symbol lvm_snapshot_release
