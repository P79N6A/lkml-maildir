I avoid sending non-working patches, and hadn't made time to
work on that issue recently.

Or at least, towards the front of the merge queue, ahead of
the various platform-specific patches.

Doing that with ARM patches is Russell's call; he hasn't been too
keen on merging from non-Linus GIT trees when that came up before.

Without them, it's harder to discern the logical structure of
all the various bitfields and their contents.

I thought the whole point of passing the clocks was to avoid needing
to ask for them!!  If trying one or three platform_get_irq() calls is
OK, then surely trying one or three clk_get() calls is also OK...
