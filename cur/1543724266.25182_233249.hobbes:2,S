If FASTBOOT is intended to be merely a container for individual related
options, this help text seems misleading. FASTBOOT=y alone will have no
effect on the kernel. It's just a gateway to other more specific
options. Something like this may be better:
	Say Y here to select among various options that can decrease
	kernel boot time. These options commonly involve providing
	hardcoded values for some parameters that the kernel usually
	determines automatically.
	This option is useful primarily on embedded systems.
	If unsure, say N.

Perhaps mention the new lpj= parameter is an alternative:
	loops_per_jiffy can also be set via the "lpj=" kernel command
	line parameter.
