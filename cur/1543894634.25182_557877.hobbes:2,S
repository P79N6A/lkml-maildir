But the only thing that *actually* matters is what the license text
*says*. It doesn't matter what the authors of the license text
intended - if they intended something else than what they actually
wrote in the license text, then they made a mistake, but that's their
problem. And what is actually in the license text is obviously what
some other people (like Linus for instance) want, so for those people
the GPLv2 is a perfectly fine license that doesn't need to be fixed
because it says exactely what they want it to say.
You can talk all you want about the spirit of the license but that
will never change the fact that it's the actual text of the license
that matters in the end.
