I think you are confusing scatter-gather with request ordering. And your
terminology is off base - a bvec doesn't consist of ordered requests, it
consist of (max) a single page. A bio consists of bvec's. A request
consits of ordered bio's. The drive queue consist of (fairly well)
ordered requests.
I won't go on about merrits of queueing and depths, search the archives
for that.
