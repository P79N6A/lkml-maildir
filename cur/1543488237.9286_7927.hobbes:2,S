Linus (and all CD creators) -- please do NOT make 2.2.2 the CDROM release
version!!!
#1 - Had to rebuild a RAID array 3x8G raid5 set.  mke2fs causes entire
operating system to hang due to "out of memory" condition (I've got 128Meg
in the machine).  Looks like the attempted fixes in inode.c are not
successful yet in flushing the buffers.  Got it to finally work by reducing
the RAID to 3x6G, and using 16384 for the bytes-per-inode -- this could've
been a show stopper (my RAID had failed).
#2 - 2.2.2 breaks CONFIG_FILTER (won't compile with this option)  -- this
means I can't upgrade one of my machines (DHCP server requires
CONFIG_FILTER)
I'm not usually one to flame but here goes...
I've been using Linux for 3 years+  for the main reason that support has
been outstanding.  However, with the release of 2.2.2 it looks like either
Linus is taking a vacation (well deserved I might add) or everybody fell off
the face of the earth.
When can we hope to have 2.2.3 with these important fixes??  Even a
pre-patch release would be welcome (which I generally avoid).  The above two
problems would be extremely embarassing for the Linux community to be on
thousands of CDROMs.
I don't want to change over to the ac kernel series but I'm really
disappointed to see that work has apparently stopped for the moment on the
main Linux branch. ________________________________________
