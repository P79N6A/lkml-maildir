Hi,
I've posted this once before for kernels 2.4.5 and 2.4.6pre5. I upgraded to
2.4.6 in the meantime, but the 
kernel still panics with the same calling stack. If there is any information
 missing please let me know. I'll 
be glad to test any patches.
Regards,
Matthias

Hi,
I've been repeatedly experiencing the same kernel panic. It happens on a
computer that acts as an isdn internet gateway for my home network. Two
other
computers, that have the same kernel and NICs but don't do ip-forwarding
have
not crashed so far.
* NIC: 3com 3c905B-TX (PCI)
* ISDN: Teles 16.3 (ISA)
The calling stack always looked pretty much the same (see Attachment).
The panic occurs, when multiple internet connections are in use. 
Regards,
Matthias

I've skimmed over the last two weeks of the archive, but did not find
anything that looked similar to me.
