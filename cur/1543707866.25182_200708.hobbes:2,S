I have managed to get the system back without reboot.  I stopped all
sendmail and mimedefang processes.  After a few minutes, I brought down
the (virtual) interface eth0:2 that served to host the MX IP 
address.  Shortly later, the machine came back.
That was on mist, the heavily loaded mail gateway.  I just added a couple
more graphs in folder 'other' that show a couple of other machines being
monitored by tap.  Ping response times grow over time, no matter what
machine is being monitored (not just linux).  Tap does not have any
virtual interfaces.

OK.  Have to run to the dump and other errands now, though... ;)
Thanks.
