Well more or less yes. Instead of adding 'depends on' on every subconfig
object, just wrap the whole thing into an if block:
	menuconfig FOOBAR
	if FOOBAR
	config FOO
	config BAR
	endif # FOOBAR
Since this is still edgy, an implicit if-endif block could be added as
part of the menuconfig. Sort of like the old menu:
	menuconfig FOOBAR
	config FOO
	config BAR
	endmenu
Robert P.J. Day had some solid ideas about this.
