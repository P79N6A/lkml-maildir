No, I'd much rather have
	if (PageDirty(page)) BUG();
there, and then have the free_swap_cache code clear the dirty bit.
We don't want to lose dirty bits by mistake. The only cases where it's ok
to clear the dirty bit is when we truncate a page completely (so it won't
be needed and obviously really shouldn't be written out) and when we've
lost the last user of a swap cache entry.
Any other cases might be bugs, where we remove a page from a mapping
without noticing that it is dirty (we had this bug in reclaim_pages(), for
example).
