- You don't handle huge pages.  For a generic function
  that sounds like a problem.
- I believe there is a reason the kernel doesn't already have
  a function like this.  I seem to recall there being efficiency
  and fast path arguments.
- Placing this code in mm/memory.c without a common consumer is
  pure kernel bloat for everyone who doesn't use this function,
  which is just about everyone.
