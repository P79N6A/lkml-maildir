Besides, cleaning up the code, has anyone identified specific performance 
problems that need to be fixed in the SCSI mid-layer? For some reason the 
Interphase FC adapter is topping out at ~72MB/s on sequential reads, 
this seems rather low, knowing that we can get 90+ with identical hardware 
under NT.
The #'s I measured were with identical with both the UNH driver and a port 
that I have done from our internal NT driver.
