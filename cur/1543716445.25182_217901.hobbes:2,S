Changes:
- network headers got fixed - most notably removed most common collisions 
between glibc and llh (I hate making hacks, but don't have much choice - 
glibc's network headers lack functionality); iproute2 and iputils should 
build with just small patches (which can be found at the above url) and 
including linux/{in*,if*} in general should be quite safe now
- various fixes all over the place (eg. strace should build on x86-64)
Enjoy.
