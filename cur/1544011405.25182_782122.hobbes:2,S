Hi Rusty,
        Here's something that has (apparently) been kicked around for
a while now and I think makes some sense.
        Avi has been especially pushing for it lately in the context
of high performance block I/O - I'll let him explain his thinking
there.
        The patches themselves are fairly trivial, there shouldn't be
anything too surprising here.
Cheers,
Mark.
