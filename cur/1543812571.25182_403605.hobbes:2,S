Folks,
I'm fed up with those finds running whenever I power on. Has anyone
written an equivalent of the Microsoft indexing service to update
locate's database?
I know about Beagle and friends but I'd be interested in whatever I'm
missing that specifically solves the above problem - I'm sure it's
been done :-)
Jon.
