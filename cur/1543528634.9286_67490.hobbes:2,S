Subject: Kernel 2.2.14 crashes on boot.

Hi,
	When I upgraded to kernel 2.2.14 it compiled fine but when I try to
boot it crashes.  It initializes most things and mounts the root file system
but when it tries to clear /tmp and dies with `kernel panic: free list
corrupted' which repeats several times.  There are no oops' generated.  My
configuration file is attached.  Is this a known issue?
