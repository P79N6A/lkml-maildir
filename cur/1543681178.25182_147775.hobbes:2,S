Thanks Dave.
I did that, and it left me with the kernel booting, but still no VT.
In fact, it appeared that rivafb that I use (says it detected my geForce
2, nevertheless ...) didn't do anything. I suppressed it and used vesafb
instead, and that was it.
I have now another strange problem, but I think I am not the only one to
experience it.
modprobe fails on /etc/modules.devfs and /etc/modules.conf at each
probeall line.
therefore, I dont have all modules up, particularly no mouse, no sound,
no pcmcia, no acpi, no ide-scsi cdrw/dvd ....
the message is
 modprobe: WARNING: /etc/modules.xxxx line xx: ignoring bad line
starting with 'probeall'
my modules.devfs only has probeall lines.
I use it also for my 2.4 kernels. What should I do ?? updated my
modultils to use modprobe-25. It looks like it doesn't support probeall
yet. Do I change all probeall for simple probes ?
The idea of  compiliing most of the modules into the kernel doesn't
appeal to me that much.
Is there any known workaround ?
Please cc me as I did not suscribe yet.
