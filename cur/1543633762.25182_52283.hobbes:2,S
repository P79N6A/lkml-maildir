Hi
Since linux currently doesn't support more than 32 groups per process, I
created a patch which expands this limit (65536 at the moment, but this is
quite abitrary).
It replaces the static groups array with a dynamically allocated array
(which is reference counted, so that we don't need to copy it on forking).
The groups array is kept sorted (which is easy, because sys_setgroups always
replaces the whole array), and is searched efficiently by using a binary
search algorithmn.
Since I'm not very experienced in kernel hacking, I'd like to know if
someone has done a similar patch (at least I could then compare my code with
it).
If there is interest, I'll post my patch here - but I didn't want to fill
your inboxes with something most people will find useless (2^16 groups is
quite a lot ;-) ).
greetings, Florian Pflug
