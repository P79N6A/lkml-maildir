So if the BIOS originally left the IOAPIC in a state where the timer 
interrupts were only going to CPU0 then by restoring that state we could 
be bringing this problem upon ourselves when we restore that state.
Would anyone have any problems with code that simply verified that the 
state which we are restoring allowed interrupts to get to the processor 
that we are currently crashing on and if not, poked in a reasonable value.
Yes this would add some complexity to the code paths where we were 
crashing but it could prevent the problem that we are seeing. It seems 
like a small fairly safe change rather than a big disruptive change like 
moving the initialization of the IOAPIC earlier in the boot process.
