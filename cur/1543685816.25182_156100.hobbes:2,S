I am encountering vairous problems with the above kernel, and it's the first time
I try to send an oops report, so please, excuse me if the format is not the
one you expect. Attached you'll find the dmesg output and the .config of my kernel.
I've tried to filter out the oops using ksymoops, but the content didn't change (already
decoded I suppose?). Basically it seems a poisoned pointer has been encountered during
the boot and there are various isdn initialization problems...
Oh, the distribution is a Mandrake 9.1.
I'm willing to provide you any further information you may request, and please cc me,
I'm not on the list.
Best regards
Andrea Aime
