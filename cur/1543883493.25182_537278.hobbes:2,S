One small regression: I worked for hours with cfs v7 as scheduler while  
listening to music (with amarok/xine engine) and the music stuttered 3 times 
in 5 hours. After then i watched a movie and that stuttered 2 times, too. But 
when i watched that previously stuttering scenes again, there was no 
stuttering.
It's not directly reproducable, it happens randomly.
