Hmm... seems to me that the new interface *removes* the page shift one
used to have to apply to the offset found in the VMA; looks like an
improvement to me.
Incidentally, the change allows the remapping of areas with physical
addresses beyond the 32-bit range, which, I believe, was why it was
done.  Meanwhile, there's a nice compatibility function, so nobody's
driver broke.  To me, there doesn't seem to be much to complain about.
