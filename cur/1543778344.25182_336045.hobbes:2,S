Okay, I did not quite realized it was shared.

set_telecom_divisor relies on CONFIG_SA1100 being set (otherwise it
breaks compilation, because struct members will not be available; at
least in this version), so I doubt it has many non-SA1100 users...

Well, I believe that UCB layer is quite well define and it looks quite
okay for touchscreen driver to be near other touchscreens... ucb-core
still needs to go somewhere, if drivers/misc was vetoed, perhaps
arch/arm/misc would be okay?

Yep :-(.

Okay, will do. [Is there chance to pull your tree using git? It would
help a bit...]
