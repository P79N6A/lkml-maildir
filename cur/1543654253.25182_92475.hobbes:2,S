Found an odd problem with loading initrd from multiple uncompressed
floppies using kernel 2.4.19...2.4.20-rc4-ac1.  Floppy #1 of a 5-floppy
Slackware 8.1 install set loads correctly, then prompts for #2.  Floppy
#2 first executes a seek-track-zero and then immediately prompts to
enter floppy #3 without transferring any data.  I thought it was a data
read error, so spent much time making new floppies; no change.
Kernel 2.4.18 does not have this problem.  2.4.19 and up exhibit it.  I
did not try 2.4.19-pre.  Interestingly, booting off of a single
(compressed) floppy works fine in all cases.
Platform is a Dell desktop GXP260, P4, I82801 chipset.
