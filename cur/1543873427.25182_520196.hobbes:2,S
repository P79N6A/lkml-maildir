do_acct_process (in kernel/acct.c) bypasses vfs_write and calls
file->f_op->write directly.  It therefore bypasses various sanity
checks, some of which appear applicable (notably inode->i_flock &&
MANDATORY_LOCK(inode)) and others of which do not (oversize request,
access_ok, etc.).  It also neglects to call
fsnotify_modify(file->f_path.dentry) after a successful write, which
may or may not matter.
Perhaps someone more knowledgeable than I could go through vfs_read
and vfs_write, distinguishing between those checks which are only
applicable to requests initiated from userspace and those which should
also be performed for in-kernel uses of f_op->read/write?
Cheers,
- Michael
