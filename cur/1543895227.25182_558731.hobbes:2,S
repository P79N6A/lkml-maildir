Hi,
The next messages contain the remaining three patches from the previous series
"PM: Remove unused and unnecessary features from suspend and resume core"
that I have promised to resend.
The patches apply to 2.6.22-rc4-mm2, which is particularly important for the
first one, as it is on top of some recent USB changes that right now are
mm-only.  If there are any problems with that, please let me know.
Greetings,
Rafael
