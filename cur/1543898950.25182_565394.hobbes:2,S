ugh, moving libraries which are already actively maintained by other core 
projects into util-linux is so not a good idea (ignoring the fact that it'd 
easily be a pita/waste for distro maintainers)

i dont really think this is dependent on util-linux at all.  nothing is 
stopping xfsprogs from depending on udev or e2fsprogs now.

incorrect.  linux changes over time as does the kernel/libc/architecture 
api's.  look at the old util-linux build system -- it had a crappy hand 
written configure script to try and detect all these different issues.
