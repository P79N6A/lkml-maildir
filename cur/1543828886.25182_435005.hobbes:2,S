very nice idea! I thought of doing sys_get_cpu() too, but my idea was to 
use the scheduler to keep a writable [and permanently pinned, 
per-thread] VDSO data page uptodate with the current CPU# [and other 
interesting data]. Btw., do we know how fast LSL is on modern CPUs?

i've Cc:-ed the glibc folks.
but my gut feeling is that we should add a proper sys_get_cpu() syscall 
as well, and thus make this a transparent syscall, not dependent on the 
availability of the vDSO.

this needs unwinder annotations as well to make this a proper DSO, so 
that for example a breakpoint here does not confuse gdb.
also, would be nice to do something like this in 64-bit mode too.
