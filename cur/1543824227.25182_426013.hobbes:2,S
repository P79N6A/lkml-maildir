And if you truly deep discharge them, they drop dead and won't remember
they've been charged. Topping off won't do any good either. So there's
some security margin your daily e.g.  LiIon appliance in your cellphone
will force upon you, in order to keep the battery alive. You can turn
the thing on over and over, but it will shut down on you after seconds.
It just won't suck the thing dry. And the charging process will be
stopped slightly before the battery is entirely full, to avoid
overcharge.

Except for the slow and irreversible chemical transformations at the
poles, I guess. Acid is corrosive, after all. So with careful handling,
those things last a long time, but not forever, unfortunately. But the
approximation is good enough, anyway.
So it appears to me that those lead acid beasts make up a rather
constant source of DC - with other solutions the state can be measured
by means of voltage alone. But the circuitry might be a bit more
complicated for this exact reason. Do you by any chance know where I
might look for schematics of such circuitry? Any hint greatly
appreciated : )
Kind regards,
