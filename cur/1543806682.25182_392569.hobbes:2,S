Well, I offered the patch because I found that I suddenly needed it.  
I did not know why the ids had been removed, but it looks to me like  
edac is coming right along and will need the ids itself, so I sent  
the patch off.
Frankly, I was surprised that the patch was so quickly accepted. I  
perceive some difference of opinion on how PCI ids should be handled.  
Is there a consensus on a better way to handle ids? Why were the ids  
removed in the first place? THAT was worse than wasted effort.
