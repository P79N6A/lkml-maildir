The virtual mapping of the cpu areas is used by the patch I 
posted for i386, ia64 and x86_64. All the ones that I have access to here.

I have not looked at sparc32 sorry. If you simply set up a couple of 
configuration values in arch/sparc32/Kconfig then everything will be fine.

All MMU platforms can use the virtual mappings. The main use of the static 
configuration is for embedded systems.
