Sorry, I still do not understand what you are fixing :)
Btw, I do not see how does fs/readdir.c:fillonedir (I am looking at
2.4.0-test10) check that buffer provided by user is long enough to keep the
name in. (that is old_readdir looks broken for me - am I missing something?)
Whereas filldir seems to check whether there is enough space left in the
buffer.
