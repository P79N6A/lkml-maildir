Indeed, so why not add an exemption into the kernel's licence for 
binary only modules that only use module exported interfaces? The 
FSF's FAQ on the GPL even covers this.
that would remove the whole "is it a derived work?" grey area we're 
talking about.

but make it explicit in the kernel's licence.
