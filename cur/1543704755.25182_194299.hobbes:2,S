My guess is that software raid is stealing a few blocks from the end of
the partition, and JFS doesn't like that, since it's journal goes all
the way to the end.  I've created a patch that will shorten the journal
if it can safely be done.  It was built against the latest jfsutils cvs
tree, but applies to version 1.1.4:
http://www10.software.ibm.com/developer/opensource/jfs/project/pub/jfsutils-1.1.4.tar.gz
Please let me know if this fixes it.  (lkml: Yeah, I know the code is
indented too far.  It's outside the kernel, so give me a break.)
