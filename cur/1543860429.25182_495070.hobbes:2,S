This looks rather strange.
The times I have seen this sort of problem is:
1) when one bit of the kernel is corrupting another part of it.
2) Kernel modules compiled with different gcc than rest of kernel.
3) kernel headers do not match the kernel being used.
One way to start tracking this down would be to run it with the fewest 
amount of kernel modules loaded as one can, but still reproduce the problem.
