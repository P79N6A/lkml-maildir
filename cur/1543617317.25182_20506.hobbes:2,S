Latest  kernel I saw working with arpd (user space daemon) I am manteining
is 2.2.16, then from 2.4.4 (for 2.4 series), some changes were done to
kernel so that the kernel does not talk correctly with the device
/dev/arpd anymore.
It is not the first time I write about this on lkml, but it seems none is
interested in manteining the kernel space component for arpd support.
I did some investigation, but the code for arpd support itself inside of
the kernel seems to be ok, something else is wrong with neighour.c.
So at less I can say the user space daemon works well on 2.2.16 I have
around ;).
