Jeff, this is the Intel card.  As an interim fix, I just changed the
megaCfg->host->max_id from 8 to 5 since the problem was when the driver
found the processor unit on the second channel of the card.
When the kernel oopses or freezes in that case though, it starts to boot,
and just dies when resetting the scsi bus because of the driver problem.
With 2.2.1, I get absolutely no output from the kernel at all (i.e. never
even "Linux version 2.2.1 (root@my.server) #2 .....").
Once lilo finishes loading the kernel and I get the "now booting kernel"
message, the machine freezes.
Again, only in 2.2.1 SMP.  2.1.131, 2.0.36 and 2.2pre kernels at least
beging to boot SMP and just oops due to driver problems.
2.2.1UP is fine.
