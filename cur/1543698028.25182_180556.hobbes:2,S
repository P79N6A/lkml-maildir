Yeah, like I said, if I boot back into 2.4.21 it'll work just fine. I know it
worked in -test2 and -test3 but somewhere between then and -test9 it stopped
working. It might've been after -test3.. I haven't really looked into using
ACPI as APM is supposed to work perfectly on my laptop and I don't want to
complicate things.. I wish I knew more about kernel hacking so that I could
look into this problem.
