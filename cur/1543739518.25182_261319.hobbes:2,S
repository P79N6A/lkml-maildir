It is perfectly possible to not have a million things happen between
select() and recvmsg() and POSIX defines what can happen and what
can't; it states that a process calling select() on a socket will not block
on a subsequent recvmsg() on that socket.

The way select() is defined in POSIX effectively means that once an
application has done a select() on a socket, the data that caused 
select() to return is committed, i.e. it can no longer be dropped and
should be considered received by the application; this has nothing
to do with UDP being unreliable and being unreliable for the sake
of it is not what UDP was meant for.
Whether you think an application that is written to use select() as
defined in POSIX is broken is not really important. The fact remains
that Linux currently implements a select() that is _not_ POSIX
compliant and is so solely for performance reasons. I personally think
correct behaviour is much more important.
