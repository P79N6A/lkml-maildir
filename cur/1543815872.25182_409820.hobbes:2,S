Turns out not to matter, since userspace can only make use of 
capabilities that are already available to userspace.  If the feature 
bits for system features are visible to it, it doesn't really matter.  
Yes, this could be broken in some cases.  But it turns out to be safe.  
Even sysenter support, which userspace does care about, is done via 
setting the vsyscall page up in the kernel, rather than userspace CPUID 
detection.

Because the last 5% is what is changing to meet Xen's needs.  Why 
document something that you know you are going to break in a week?  I 
chose to document the stable interfaces first.
