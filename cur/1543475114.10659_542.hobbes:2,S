Hi,
Just got word from the QA guys -- they're also still seeing corruption, 
although less of it.  However, the corruption is not limited to just Solaris 
(they noticed the corruption to a NetApp dedicated NFS server).
| I still have several suggestions from Bill Hawes on how to gather
| some data on this so I'll attempt to get some useful NFS debug
| logs before the end of the day today. (That's by 5pm USA EST).
| I'll send it to Bill Hawes and to the list.
if there's anything I can test/provide for debugging, let me know.
