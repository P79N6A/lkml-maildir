I'm new to LKML, and because this is "my first release" I've held off 
saying that the development model scares me.  No doubt I need to see it 
through a couple of releases, minimum.  If I was less sanguine I might 
say something about how often "this is tested and ready to be pushed 
upstream" presages "the system is broken and doesn't work."  I think if 
most CIOs monitored the list they'd never let Linux anywhere near their 
business systems.  It's scary!
