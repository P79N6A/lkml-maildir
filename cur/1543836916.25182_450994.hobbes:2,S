Thanks, pulled and pushed out.
Oh, I just got a few reports of 2.6.18-rc3 not building with external
trees very well, and something like the following would be required:
--- linux-2.6.17/arch/sh/Makefile-dist        2006-08-07 20:42:33.000000000 +0200

Was this fixed in -rc4 and I should update the SuSE kernel to it (well,
I'll do that anyway later today...), or is this something that you did
not know about?
thanks,
