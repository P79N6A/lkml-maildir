Apache uses a pre-fork "threading" mechanism, it spawns (fork()s) new instances
of itself whenever it finds out that the number of idle "threads" is below a
certain (configurable) threshold.
Despite of all apparences this method performs beautifully on Linux, pthreads are
actually slower in many cases, since you will incur some additional overhead due
to thread synchronization and scheduling.
The problem is that beyond a certain number of processes the scheduler just goes
bananas, or so it seems to me.
Since Linux threads are mapped on processes, I don't think that (p)threads woud
help in any way, unless it is the VM context switch overhead that is playing a
role here, which I wouldn't think is the case.
