unmap()?
That's the big one, actually. The exit case we _could_ do very differently
anyway, and there are reasons that we probably should try to.
(When we exit, we could flush the TLB and at the same time do a
"speculative" switch to the mm of the next process on the run-queue of
this CPU, so that when we actually tear down the MM we would have no TLB
issues at all any more).
