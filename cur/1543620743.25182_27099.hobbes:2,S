      Just tried 2.5.4-pre6 and got hung postfix "master" process which I cannot
      kill in RUNNABLE state. Here is traces of all postfix processes at the time:
   pickup        Z C212E180    48   522    520   523       (L-TLB)
   Call Trace: [do_exit+745/784] [sys_exit+14/16] [syscall_call+7/11]
   qmgr          S F70FBF30    48   523    520   524   522 (NOTLB)
   Call Trace: [schedule_timeout+128/160] [process_timeout+0/16] [do_select+470/544] [sys_select+832/1152] [syscall_call+7/11]
   tlsmgr        S F70F5F30  8944   524    520   523 (NOTLB)
   Call Trace: [schedule_timeout+128/160] [process_timeout+0/16] [do_select+470/544] [sys_select+832/1152] [syscall_call+7/11]
   master        R F773F744    48   520    900   524               (NOTLB)
   Call Trace: [__write_lock_failed+9/32] [.text.lock.open+71/137] [unix_create+92/112] [sock_map_fd+12/304] [select_bits_free+10/16]
      [sys_socket+29/96] [sys_socket+48/96] [sys_socketcall+99/512] [syscall_call+7/11]
      Hope this will help someone to nail a problem
It doesn't help.  You need to find the backtrace of the other process
holding the lock the AF_UNIX code wants as well, dumping just these
few processes isn't enough.
Franks a lot,
