Humm, having to relook at the question.  When I begin to work in
supermount, there was a need for a patch (trampoline.S), that I don't
need anymore after I remove one asmlinkage from the exported
functions.  But if you told that it is not needed, you are the ppc
maintainer, can be that any side effect made that code not to be
needed anymore.
Later, Juan.
