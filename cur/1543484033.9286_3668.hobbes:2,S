Even better, a level of abstraction should be added so that users don't
actually *need* to do:
	make dep; make clean; make whatever-they-want-here
In other words, perhaps an option in "make xconfig" could actually do this,
with a nice GUI bar showing "Compilation in progress...".  
Naturally, you could allow the user to select which sort of image they
want (bzImage, whatever...), along with documentation on what images are
suitable for different purposes.
Another step forward to making Linux more accessible...
Tris.
