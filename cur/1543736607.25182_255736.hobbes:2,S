Hi Greg,
When I wanted to implement some environment variables in my hotplug
method, I looked for an example of how to do it.  I noticed two
things: adding values ends up being kind of messy, and the hotplug
method in drivers/usb/core/usb.c is subtly wrong!  These two patches
attempt to fix both of those problems.
Let me know if you don't like the HOTPLUG_ENV_VAR name and want
something different.
If you apply these, I'll send patches to use HOTPLUG_ENV_VAR in net/,
drivers/ieee1394/, etc.
Thanks,
  Roland
