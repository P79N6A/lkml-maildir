Do the numeric uids/gids under /usr/src/linux-2.2.0pre7 correspond to
a known user?  (Try `find -nouser').  If not, tar can become _really_
slow asking NIS for a username for each file anew.
I had this phenomenon when I upgraded my home machine to SuSE 6.0
with libc6.  The default /etc/nssswitch.conf has NIS included, even if
NIS is not installed.
