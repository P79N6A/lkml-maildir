Typo, the description should be
Changelog for version 2
1. Back end tracking is done in bytes, round up values of the limit if the
   specified value is not a multiple of page size. Display memory.usage
   and memory.limit in bytes (Dave Hansen, Paul Menage)
Change the interface to use bytes instead of pages. Page sizes can vary
across platforms and configurations. A new strategy routine has been added
to the resource counters infrastructure to format the data as desired.
Suggested by David Rientjes, Andrew Morton and Herbert Poetzl
Tested on a UML setup with the config for memory control enabled.
