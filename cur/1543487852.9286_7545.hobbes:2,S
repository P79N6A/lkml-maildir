i suffer this, too.
the normal clients (pentium, k6 mqachines) work very good with the server
(k6). everything is switched (100 mbit, 3com), and all machines have 3c905b
cards.
but i also have 5 machines: ibm ps/2 model 70 (microchannel, esdi hard disks,
4 mb ram, 3 com network cards for microchannel). these machines always
get these two error messages. it took me an hour or so to copy 15 mb to 
the clients hard disk.  ftp is working ok.
is there some idea how i can tune these machines ?
or some kernel patches to try ?
