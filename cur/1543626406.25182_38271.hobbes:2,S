I hope it is obvious it was a joke? Perhaps to make the joke intention
clearer I should have suggested a better "symbol exporting protocol" from
kindergarten experience:
module -> kernel: export your symbols, please
kernel -> module: you export yours first and I'll export some of mine
which is not totally unlike the scheme suggested by bona fide
EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL defenders, namely "if binary-only modules don't
contribute to the base kernel why should the base kernel let them use it's
symbols".
