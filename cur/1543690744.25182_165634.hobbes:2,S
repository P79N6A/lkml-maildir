Clearly, since it's expressed that way in the Kconfig file: 
config SOFTWARE_SUSPEND
        bool "Software Suspend (EXPERIMENTAL)"
        depends on EXPERIMENTAL && PM && SWAP
Did you hand edit the .config file, or were you able to enable 
SOFTWARE_SUSPEND w/o CONFIG_SWAP in one of the configurators? 
Thanks,
