Subject: [PATCH 9/9] tmpfs: fix shmem_swaplist races
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Intensive swapoff testing shows shmem_unuse spinning on an entry in
shmem_swaplist pointing to itself: how does that come about?  Days pass...
First guess is this: shmem_delete_inode tests list_empty without taking the
global mutex (so the swapping case doesn't slow down the common case); but
there's an instant in shmem_unuse_inode's list_move_tail when the list entry
may appear empty (a rare case, because it's actually moving the head not the
the list member).  So there's a danger of leaving the inode on the swaplist
when it's freed, then reinitialized to point to itself when reused.  Fix that
by skipping the list_move_tail when it's a no-op, which happens to plug this.
But this same spinning then surfaces on another machine.  Ah, I'd never
suspected it, but shmem_writepage's swaplist manipulation is unsafe: though
we still hold page lock, which would hold off inode deletion if the page were
in pagecache, it doesn't hold off once it's in swapcache (free_swap_and_cache
doesn't wait on locked pages).  Hmm: we could put the the inode on swaplist
earlier, but then shmem_unuse_inode could never prune unswapped inodes.
Fix this with an igrab before dropping info->lock, as in shmem_unuse_inode;
though I am a little uneasy about the iput which has to follow - it works,
and I see nothing wrong with it, but it is surprising that shmem inode
deletion may now occur below shmem_writepage.  Revisit this fix later?
And while we're looking at these races: the way shmem_unuse tests swapped
without holding info->lock looks unsafe, if we've more than one swap area:
a racing shmem_writepage on another page of the same inode could be putting
it in swapcache, just as we're deciding to remove the inode from swaplist -
there's a danger of going on swap without being listed, so a later swapoff
would hang, being unable to locate the entry.  Move that test and removal
down into shmem_unuse_inode, once info->lock is held.
