That would break typical system bootup in the unclean journal case, 
normally the root FS is mounted read-only to start with (which replays 
the journal) and remounted read-write later on - and usually the fsck 
utilities are located on the root filesystem..

I agree, there should be a way to force it to mount "really read only" 
so it doesn't try to replay the journal. That might require just 
ignoring the journal content, which may result in the FS appearing 
corrupt, but for recovery/forensics purposes that seems better than 
nothing..
