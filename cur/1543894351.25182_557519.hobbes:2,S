A hundred or so messages back someone stated that the parport driver in Linux 
is GPLv1.1 - however, on checking on this statement for myself I've found 
that there is no statement about it being v1.1 and, in fact, given that Linux 
itself is GPLv2 there is no possible way any code covered by GPLv1.1 can 
exist.

Dialup is like pissing through a pipette. Slow and excruciatingly painful.
