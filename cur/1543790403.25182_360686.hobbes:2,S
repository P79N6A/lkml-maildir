Yes, I created it. I also extracted the initrd image and compared it 
with a initrd that works fine (the initrd-2.6.12-1.1456_FC4.img initrd 
image provided by the kernel-2.6.12-1.1456_FC4.i386.rpm kernel package) 
and the images have the same files.
I got the mkinitrd-5.0.8-1 package and the 
kernel-devel-2.6.12-1.1456_FC4.i686.rpm package too. I compiled the 
mkinitrd package with the command:
# rpmbuild --rebuild mkinitrd-5.0.8-1.src.rpm
# rpm -ivh /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386/mkinitrd-5.0.8-1.i386.rpm
I also changed parameters in the kernel.spec file and recompiled it. The 
parameters was changed from:
%define buildsmp 1
...
%patch800 -p1
To:
%define buildsmp 0
...
# %patch800 -p1
(the nonint patch was generating error messages during the kernel rpm 
compilation)
# rpmbuild --target i686 -ba /usr/src/redhat/SPECS/kernel.spec
# rpm -ivh /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i686/kernel-2.6.12.ext3-2.i686.rpm
After I finished the process, I booted the machine and got the same 
error message. I also rebuilt the initrd image and built a new 2.6.13 
fedora core src.rpm kernel, but it still not working... any more idea??
Thank you.
Márcio.
