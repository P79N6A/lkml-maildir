Something in the last 24hrs in linus bk broke my ability to mount root:
Creating root device
Mounting root filesystem
mount: error 6 mounting ext3
mount: error 2 mounting none
Switching to new root
Switchroot: mount failed 22
umount /initrd/dev failed: 2
If I back off a day everything works again. 
Root is on Intel ICH5 SATA drive.
