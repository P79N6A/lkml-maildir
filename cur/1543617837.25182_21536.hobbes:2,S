These things use a SEEPROM (Serial EEPROM), they need bit-banger software
to perform a write. If you can boot DOS or FREE_DOS, use the software
you got with the card (or download the executable from the vendor's site),
and restore the parameters.
Since these ne2000* ISA boards need bit-banger software, to change
anything, it seems to me that some driver for some other board "thought"
it saw its hardware and tried to use its bit-banger software to enable the
I/O connector or change I/O configuration. The ne.c software does not
do bit-banging I/O so it can't be the culprit.

    I was going to compile a list of innovations that could be
    attributed to Microsoft. Once I realized that Ctrl-Alt-Del
    was handled in the BIOS, I found that there aren't any.
