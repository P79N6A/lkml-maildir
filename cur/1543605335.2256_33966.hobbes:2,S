In particular the xircom_tulip_cb driver from 2.4.13-pre4 should work well 
at Columbia (since that's one place where I tested it :-). You can simply 
copy the xircom_tulip_cb.c from 2.4.13-pre4 into pretty much any 2.4 
kernel and recompile, and it should work -- except maybe for the 
MODULE_LICENSE line which can be safely commented out.
Arjan, are there still cards that don't work without promisc mode enabled? 
I got two different versions myself and both work very nicely with the 
latest xircom_tulip_cb.
Thanks,
Ion
