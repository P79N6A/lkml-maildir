Thanks, Mike, I will be watching your progress and offer my support! I
submitted a patch to move to 64 bit (which also drops the virt_to_bus
code) several years ago and it was rejected because of the focus on the
time to make i2o_block the driver of choice for this line of
controllers. I then reacted to the rejection by working with Markus
Lidel to move the 64 bit capabilities into the i2o driver.
