I'm experiencing the same problem since pre8. I already posted this a few
days ago. 
My setup is kinda complex (p200, 64mb,some ide disks, soft raid1, aha-2920
with 4 7-cd-changers attached, a quickcam running as webcam, some perl
'daemons' running an mp3 jukebox, X, samba, netatalk, etc.) , so I really
can't tell where the problem lies. 
All I can say is that this system has been under _heavy_ load since the
early 2.0.x kernels and has never had a hard lock-up before. 
CPU load is usually very high, especially when someone's on the webcam and
mp3 tunes are being played at the same time. 
With only 64mb of RAM, there's quite often swapping...
Since pre8, I've had about a lock-up a day, in different situations,
sometimes with nothing than a few idle daemons running under no heavy cpu
or network load.
No network response, no response to keyboard input, no kernel oops, nothing
in the logs. 
All I can do is push the reset button and wait till my raid devices have
been checked =(
If anyone has an idea, I'm willing to try everything ;)
