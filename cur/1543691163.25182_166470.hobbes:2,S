Hello, 
I used a 2.4.21 to boot on lan and nfs root.
Recently, i got my box rebooting endless.
I have moved to 2.4.22 and i got that error : 
NET4: Unix domain sockets 1.0/SMP for Linux NET4.0.
Looking up port of RPC 100003/2 on 213.186.32.57
Looking up port of RPC 100005/1 on 213.186.32.57
VFS: Mounted root (nfs filesystem).
mount_devfs_fs(): unable to mount devfs, err: -2
Freeing unused kernel memory: 268k freed
Warning: unable to open an initial console.
Kernel panic: No init found.  Try passing init= option to kernel.
 
It's correctly mounting the nfsroot but if cannot mount the devfs .
The kernel got nfsroot , dhcp, devfs at boot .
I checked if there still was the /dev entry and it still was ...
Were can I found the meaning of "err: -2" ?
Do someone caught that error once ?
	Bert.
