It is linux telling you that your code is crappy ;)
It's easy to fix. You just need to fix the lock to not turn off interrupts
for such a long time. If you're writing non driver network code you likely don't need
an _irqsave lock anyways, as a _bh lock should suffice. Better would be to use 
a different lock structure however for such long locks that do not depend on blocking 
bottom halves or interrupts (e.g. see how the TCP socket lock works as an example)
