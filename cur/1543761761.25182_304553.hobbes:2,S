There are couple of things that I an concerned with:
1. I don't like that it overrides meaning of max_proto parameter to be
exactly the protocol specified. However, if you take my psmouse
protocol switching through sysfs patch we can drop that change and
require that non auto-detectable protocols be activated through sysfs
after loading the driver.
2. It looks like it bypasses rate and resolution setting in
psmouse_initialize. What was the reason for it? Does setting rate or
resolution disturbs lifebook mode? If so the driver has to implement
it's own set_rate and set_resolution handlers so when one tries to
change rate from userspace (through sysfs) the request would be
ignored.
