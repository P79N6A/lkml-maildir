  You're probably right.  I saw trouble happening when lpfc was in
 action and thought it might have something to do with it, but then
 again I'm not very intimate with the inner workings of the kernel.

  I have no opinion if this is something that appeared in -rc3 or not as
 I upgraded to it directly from 2.6.20 (which never gave me similar
 problems).  I'm compiling a new kernel with Matthew Wilcox' patch now,
 and will try a few more reboots to see how that helped.  I'll post
 about my findings tomorrow.
