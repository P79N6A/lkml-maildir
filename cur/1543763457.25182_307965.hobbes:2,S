Hello, developers.
In order to compete with the new upcoming releases of the
various OSes, and to join all developers efforts into the 
one really promising and powerfull direction,
I present you following patch, 
which removes absolutely unused in a real world, 
unsupported by vendors and definitely hard to build
from commodity hardware arch.
Due to it's famous bugability there are tons of quirks 
all over the place in the Kernel tree, so it is only 
begining. 
Let's create our OS the best all over the world - let's remove i386.
