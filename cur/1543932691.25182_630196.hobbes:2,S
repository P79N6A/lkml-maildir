Heh, actually I *know* I'm doing the wrong thing; but I'm hoping I've
got better chances of getting steered in the right direction if I
start by throwing code out there.  Currently this patch handles
insertion/removal just fine if nothing is mounted, but gets stuck if
the disk is in use.  How do I get the kernel to cancel all pending
requests when deregistering the device?
Thanks,
