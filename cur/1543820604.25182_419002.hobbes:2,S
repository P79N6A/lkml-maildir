Yes. Report it to ATI, it looks like their code is involved here.
If you can reproduce the problem with a non-tainted kernel (that is,
without the closed-source ATI module ever having been loaded), then
please re-submit the bugreport with crash info from the non-tainted
kernel. Then someone on LKML may be able to help you, otherwise only
ATI can help you.
