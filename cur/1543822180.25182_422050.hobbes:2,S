I don't see how they'll happen if the heartbeat/management runs over
the same network that is used to connect to the disk.

I'm aware of the idea. I think that a static quorum would be best, and
that it should be configured by the cluster administrator. See
http://lists.osdl.org/pipermail/osdlcluster/2004-January/000071.html
for a description of the problem with dynamic quorum.

The primary target storage protocol is ATA-over-Ethernet, second is
iSCSI. As far as I know, it should be relatively simple, in both
circumstances, to tell the storage blade to cut off a computer until
it correctly re-registers itself with the cluster. Otherwise, a CISCO
managed switch should also be able to cut off a computer if it stops
responding to the cluster.

Having trouble finding too many details on these. I'll keep looking,
but some pointers could be helpful.

I figured that IO Fencing combined with STONITH (Shoot The Other Node
In The Head) could solve the problems caused by most crashes.

These thoughts are based on my best understanding of how-stuff-works
so far. Any further comments would be greatly appreciated.
