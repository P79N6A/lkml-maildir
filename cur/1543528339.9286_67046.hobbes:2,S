Are you guys running the driver *under* NT, or are you only talking about
sharing partitions between the native NT driver & and the Linux NTFS driver?
(I don't know the NT port was usable, never tried it)
Either way, there are a number of problems with the (linux) driver which AFAIK
haven't been mixed, and Martin von L. doesn't seem to be actively developing
it. Also, I'm not the world's greatest coder, and I'm not usually fussy about
style, but I find the driver source unusually difficult to follow..
Don't use the write support unless you actively want to trash your data ;-)
