Just so we don't lose the forest for the trees...
Not trying to put words in Linus's mouth, but it seems to me he wasn't 
complaining specifically about bsg.  "style cleanups", "cosmetic 
cleanups", ancient ISA driver polishing (1542, my gdth patch) are 
definitely not "bug fix only" material.
The lpfc update was probably the biggest thing, LOC-wise.  And even 
though that was mostly bug fixes -- and notably NOT 100% fixes -- it is 
big enough to warrant integration testing and exposure prior to 
mainline.  Definitely merge-window-open material AFAICS.
