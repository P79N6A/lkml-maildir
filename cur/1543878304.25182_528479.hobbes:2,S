(Please CC me on emails, I'm not on LKML).
Somewhere between 2.6.19 and 2.6.20, unloading of the netconsole module
got broken. It's still broken as of 2.6.21-rc6.
If you try to unload the module, the rmmod/modprobe-r just sits there
forever. I can reproduce it on tg3, forcedeth and e1000 hardware (all in
various Opteron machines)
Looking at the differences in netconsole itself between .19 and .20,
they are extremely small, so I'd guess that the problem probably lies in
netpoll itself.
Originally, I was trying to unload the module to reconfigure the log
destination - maybe a sysfs interface for (re-)configuration would be a
good addition as well?
