I see.

And yes, this won't work. I was misunderstanding what was happening.
I guess your problem is that you're overloading the pte protection bits
for present ptes as protection bits for not present (file) ptes. I'd rather
you just used a different encoding for file pte protections then.
"Wasting" a bit seems much more preferable for this very uncommon case (for
most people) rather than bloating pte_present check, which is called in
practically every performance critical inner loop).
That said, if the patch is i386/uml specific then I don't have much say in
it. If Ingo/Linus and Jeff/Yourself, respectively, accept the patch, then
fine.
But I think you should drop the comment from the core code. It seems wrong.
