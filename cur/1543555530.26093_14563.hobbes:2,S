You don't need to test network that much: if your network card garbles
packets under high load, it is ok. TCP checksums should catch that.
(OTOH, on really broken serial cable (no flow control and machines
definitely miss characters sometimes), I can occassionaly see
corruption even with TCP. Ouch.)
