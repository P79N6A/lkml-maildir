Side note: it might not even be a "close-on-exec by default" thing: it 
might well be a *always* close-on-exec.
That COE is pretty horrid to do, we need to scan a bitmap of those things 
on each exec. So it migth be totally sensible to just declare that the 
non-linear fd's would simply always be "local", and never bleed across an 
execve).
