Most RISC architectures are claiming a huge register set advantage over 
IA32.
However in reality it's normal that:
1. Some of the register take roles as declared by the ABI. One is stack 
one
is basis pointer and so no.
2. Only a subset of register is declared to be guaranteed to be 
preserved by
system calls.
Thus the mechanisms are simple calling conventions.
Compilers can frequently see what a subroutine does and can flatten out 
the cost
of function calls to something very much resembling just two jumps 
instead of
a single jump around a condition.
On the other hand most modern IA32 implementation (since cyrix 486) are 
very
efficient at mapping stack operations to a special cache between the 
CPU and
L1 cache. I could even imagine them to be more efficient then plain 
jumps, which
simply don't carry the same information for cache prefetch and branch 
predition.
