Hi Linus,
In that case, a nice refinement is to put the sequence number at the end of 
the subject line so patch sequences don't interleave:
   Subject: [PATCH] Unbork OOM Killer (1 of 3)
   Subject: [PATCH] Unbork OOM Killer (2 of 3)
   Subject: [PATCH] Unbork OOM Killer (3 of 3)
   Subject: [PATCH] Unbork OOM Killer (v2, 1 of 3)
   Subject: [PATCH] Unbork OOM Killer (v2, 2 of 3)
   ...
Regards,
Daniel
