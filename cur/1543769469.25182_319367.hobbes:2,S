I'm certainly ok with that, especially since it should never be a problem
in practice (ie the virtual memory map getting so full that we even get to
these low allocations should be basically something that never happens
under normal load).
However, it would be good to have even the trivial patch tested. 
Especially since what it tries to fix is a total corner-case in the first 
place..
