The next thing I was going to suggest was the software RAID.  You appear
to have a RAID 0 or 1 with one disk on irq14 and one on irq15.  I am not
sure how interrupts are handled by Linux IDE RAID, but it seems like
this would be tricky.  I bet the threading is screwing up the
synchronization between the devices, and you end up with one waiting
forever for the other - the possibilities for lockup are endless.
However, I have no idea what you would do about this.  You could try
making those irqs non-threaded, but you'd have to do it one at a time,
and I would *definitely* expect weird stuff with one threaded and one
not.
I will have to defer to someone with more kernel expertise.
