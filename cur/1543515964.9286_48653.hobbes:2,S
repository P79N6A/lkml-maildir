Hey Andre,
I am running on a Asus K7M, which has the AMD 751 Northbridge and the VIA
82C686A Southbridge.
I was wondering if it is possible to set it up that it detects the ata66
mode.
And yes, I have a 80 ribbon ata66 cable :P
My CD-ROM gets listed with UDMA(33) mode, but when I do dmesg, there is
nothing behind my HDD ( UDMA(66) ).
After recompiling hdparm, and running it, it shows it's running in UDMA mode
4 :)
System:
AMD Athlon 500
Asus K7M
IBM-DJNA-370910 7200 RPM 2MB cache ATA66
128 Meg RAM
Slackware 7.0 + Linux 2.2.13(FINAL) + latest IDE patches
Hope you can help me :)
Kind Regards,
Bas van Loon
