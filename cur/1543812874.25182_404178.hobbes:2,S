I've reverted x86_64-mm-i386-early-alignment.patch from 2.6.16-rc5-mm3:
cache_line_size() 0 gave me a divide-by-0 in kmem_cache_init().
On one machine (i386 UP) - the others (i386 SMP and x86_64 SMP) having
no trouble at all.
Some years ago, the life-cycle of boot_cpu_data was rather convoluted,
and different on UP from SMP: perhaps it still is, and that's why the
difference.  But I've not delved deeper, expecting you or Andi to grasp
it a lot quicker.
(I never tried -mm2, so wouldn't have noticed if that patch was in -mm2.)
Hugh
