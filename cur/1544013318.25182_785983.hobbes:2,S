The full opensuse distribution also has a couple of spec files for
generating cross compilers from recent versions. These are for
icecream, but can be relatively easily adapted (or the binaries
reused)
In general I don't think building cross compilers is as hard
as it used to be, so it can be reasonably done without any support
scripts too.
Really no excuse to still use the old crosstool crap :)
