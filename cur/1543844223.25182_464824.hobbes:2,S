Subject: Is there an fsck for UDF ?

This is slightly OT. I have a DVD-RAM, which I used for amost 1 
and 1/2 year, but now it reports "udf: udf_read_inode(ino 2504) 
failed !bh", and as a result I can't delete a certain file.
Is there some way to fix it without formating ? udftools has a 
non-working fsck.
