In trying to DES encrypt a loop mounted ext2 file system, I get the
following errors:
losetup -e des /dev/loop4 MYFILE3
Password: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Init (up to 16 hex digits): xxxxxxxxxxxxx
ioctl: LOOP_SET_STATUS: Invalid argument
Using XOR works but we all know XOR isn't secure. Is there a patch to fix this?
