Kill as much cache as you can (run a memory hog), and it should drop
sharply.  If it doesn't, it's likely a leak.  There are no 'reasonable'
values to expect.  Memleak shows the number of active allocations which
originated from a particular spot.  In some cases, the numbers look higher
than expected because the allocation 'cause' is passed down to lower level
allocators.. let's you see what kind off memory is being lost in event
of a leak.  As a result, the originator may be credited with lower level
allocations which were caused by servicing a higher level allocator's
request. (adjustable via MEMLEAK_PASS_ALLOCATION and MEMLEAK_UNWRAP_XXX)
