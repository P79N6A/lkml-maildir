Missed this email :) I gave your last patch a spin and im seeing similar
behaviour.
Its got to be an overly enthuiastic active balance, the migration threads 
have used about 10 minutes of cpu time and a single cpu bound process
will never sleep (assuming there is nothing else to run) and so cannot be
moved by normal means.
