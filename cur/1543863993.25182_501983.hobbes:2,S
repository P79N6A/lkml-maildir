You can eliminate the tty buffering altogether
by observing what gets passed to the line discipline.
I assume you are using the default line discipline N_TTY.
Look at what is passed to drivers/char/n_tty.c:n_tty_receive_buf()
If all the data gets that far, then there is some issue
with the line discipline or something further downstream.
If not, then the problem is with the tty buffering (assuming
you are correct that all data gets to the tty buffering code
followed by a tty_flip_buffer_push call).
