yes - the default case is very similar to that: exec() works for a
1-member thread_group, otherwise i couldnt have booted the kernel.

ok. libpthreads uses an internal clone() for posix_spawn() [which does
what your example illustrates] which should be a tad faster than vfork() -
but vfork() should work just as well.
