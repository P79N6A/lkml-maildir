Hi all,
I am having a problem with par_port/lp recognising my parallel port. I have
an i810 TYAN motherboard. Basically, par_port/lp says that no port exists.
I've tried all three BIOS options (ECP/EPP/Normal) with the same result.
Im running a stock RH6.1 with 2.2.12 kernel.
Any comments would be appreciated.
TIA
