i obviously agree that any such crash is a serious problem, but is it 
caused by the spinlock-debugging code? I doubt it is, unless __delay() 
is seriously buggered.
in any case, to move this problem forward i'd suggest we go with the 
patch below in -mm and wait for feedback. It fixes a potential overflow 
in the comparison (if HZ*lpj overflows 32-bits) That needs a really fast 
box to run the 32-bit kernel though, so i doubt this is the cause of the 
problems. In any case, this change makes it easier to increase the 
looping timeout from 1 second to 10 seconds later on or so - at which 
point the overflow can happen for real and must be handled .

From: Ingo Molnar <mingo@elte.hu>
make sure the right hand side of the comparison does not overflow
on 32-bits. Also print out more info when detecting a lockup, so
that we see how many times the code tried (and failed) to get the
lock.
