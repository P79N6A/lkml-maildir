I understand your fears. Actually, I had the same reaction when I heard
about the djprobes project. What I am doing with the immediate values
are a quite simpler version of live code patching which limits what has
to be patched to a very simple subset of instructions which layout
(alignment, etc) can be controlled.
I have taken the said erratas into consideration and developed the
algorithms that makes sure they won't be triggered. I would suggest that
you present test cases that proves your fear right, or if you could cite
documentation of the specific CPU models upon which you base your
comment.
Reproducing the errata both on PIII and Intel Core2 duo seems very hard
to achieve. If anyone out there have a "known" test case to trigger the
fault, I would gladly do some more testing to show the behavior without
my algorithm (non working) vs with my algorithm in the same conditions.
> 2) new type pretending to be standard and idiomatic -- immediate_t
Representing the data referred to by immediate_reads seems important to
me, because not doing so would result in people updating the variable
directly without using immediate_set, which, of course, would not update
all the references to the variable. If you have better suggestions, I am
open to them.

It's a special if() statement that uses its argument (an immediate
value) as a condition for a branch. The reason why it's not under the
form if (immediate_read(var)) is because I want to leave room from
improvement if gcc guys ever want to implement nop/jmp based branches
that could be patchable at runtime.

Here are the test redone with error estimates :
10 runs of 100 iterations each: (I don't have more time to do the 10000
iterations I've done the first time, sorry, stats will take care of
showing the errors appropriately). Tests done on a 3GHz P4. Here I run
getppid with syscall trace inactive, comparing memory pressure and w/o
memory pressure. (sorry, my system is not setup to execute syscall_trace
this time, but it will make the point anyway).
No memory pressure
Reading timestamps:     150.92 cycles,     std dev.    1.01 cycles
getppid:               1462.09 cycles,     std dev.   18.87 cycles
With memory pressure
Reading timestamps:     578.22 cycles,     std dev.  269.51 cycles
getppid:              17113.33 cycles,     std dev. 1655.92 cycles
Now for memory read timing: (10 runs, branches per test: 100000)
Memory read based branch:
                       644.09 cycles,      std dev.   11.39 cycles
L1 cache hit based branch:
                        88.16 cycles,      std dev.    1.35 cycles
So, now that we have the raw results, let's calculate:
Memory read:
644.09±11.39 - 88.16±1.35 = 555.93±11.46 cycles
Getppid without memory pressure:
1462.09±18.87 - 150.92±1.01 = 1311.17±18.90 cycles
Getppid with memory pressure:
17113.33±1655.92 - 578.22±269.51 = 16535.11±1677.71 cycles
Therefore, if we add 2 markers not based on immediate values to the getppid
code, which would add 2 memory reads, we would add
2 * 555.93±12.74 = 1111.86±25.48 cycles
Therefore,
1111.86±25.48 / 16535.11±1677.71 = 0.0672
 relative error: sqrt(((25.48/1111.86)^2)+((1677.71/16535.11)^2))
                     = 0.1040
 absolute error: 0.1040 * 0.0672 = 0.0070
Therefore: 0.0672±0.0070 * 100% = 6.72±0.70 %
We can therefore affirm that adding 2 markers to getppid, on a system
with high memory pressure, would have a performance hit of at least 6.0
% on the system call time, all within the uncertainty limits of these
tests. The same applies to other kernel code paths. The smaller those
code paths are, the highest the impact ratio will be.

Same reason as 2). Note that the standard case is immediate_int_t,
immediate_long_t... and is not as bad as having to express the whole
pointer type in the type name. That's the best tradeoff between
restricting direct update of these pointers and code readability I have
seen. I am open to better solutions...

I think you are missing the whole point there. The scheduler profiling
patch is only an example of how immediate values can be used. Timer
stats would perfectly fit too, blktrace, .... actually, any feature that
is very useful to have in a distro, but where the choice much be made at
compile time can now be temporarily activated at runtime when needed.
"unlike getpid/getppid is non-trivial function" : I am instrumenting a
*lot* of kernel paths with LTTng, including do_syscall_entry and
do_syscall_exit, which happen to be executed upon *all* system calls
when tracing is active. I used getppid (tracing inactive, but
do_syscal_trace forced) to exemplify the performance difference of a
simple system call, but you must note that it applies to _every_ system
call in the kernel. I've seen people complain when impact of a dormant
tracer on the select() system call is noticeable _at all_, so, yes, a
3.5% impact on getppid is meaningful.

Should they discuss what performance deterioration is acceptable for new
infrastructures such as tracer too ? In the end, they may decide that
"it can be compiled away anyway", but distros will not ship kernels with
features that slows down the kernel and people will still complain that
Linux does not ship with a tracing alternative comparable to Dtrace.
The question that arises when selecting a new feature is not "what is
the average performance improvement of this", but rather "what is the
worse case performance hit". This is exactly what I address.
