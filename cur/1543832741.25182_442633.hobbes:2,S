Your patch does fix it.  But I'm worried about removing
empty nodes at boot-time.  I want to support the following
scenario:
  node 0: 1 enabled CPU, 3 disabled CPUs, no local memory
  node 1: 4 disabled CPUs, no local memory
  node 2: no CPUs, big interleaved memory across nodes 0 & 1
At run-time, I'd like to be able to enable any or all of the
7 disabled CPUs.  If you remove the "empty" node 1 at boot-time,
it sounds like I won't be able to enable its CPUs later.
