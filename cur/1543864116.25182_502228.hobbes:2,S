Is there a convention regarding the information that a wireless MAC layer should provide when
reporting scan data from an AP with a hidden SSID?
In ieee80211, the software inserts the string "<hidden>" for such an AP, which seems to give
wpa_supplicant fits because it rejects the SSID before even looking at the encryption data. Is this
the normal convention?
Thanks,
Larry
