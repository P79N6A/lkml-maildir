An excellent point, but the existence of pthread_mutex_trylock()
invalidates it.
To be very specific, the following will do the job:
volatile unsigned shared_variable;
pthread_mutex_t lock = PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER;
void
thread_function()
{
	unsigned prev_value = shared_variable;
	for (;;) {
		unsigned cur_value, delta;
		if (pthread_mutex_trylock(&lock) == 0) {
			cur_value = ++shared_variable;
			pthread_mutex_unlock(&lock);
			delta = cur_value - prev_value;
		} else {
			/* Another thread is holding the lock. */
			pthread_mutex_lock(&lock);
			cur_value = ++shared_variable;
			pthread_mutex_unlock(&lock);
			delta = cur_value - prev_value;
			if (delta == 1)
				fatal("non-compliant");
		}
		/* Assuming we don't wrap */
		if (delta == 0)
			fatal("buggy as a roach motel");
	}
}
You need to run more than one instance of the thread_function()
to have a chance of triggering the non-compliant message, of course.
