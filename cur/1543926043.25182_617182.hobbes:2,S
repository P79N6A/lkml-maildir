There would also be the minor fact that the original test is being
inverted in this 'fix'. An accurate fix should at the very least be
   !(share = *shpp).

It would be a lot cleaner just to pull the entire assignment out of the
for() statement. IOW:
	for (shpp = &file->f_shares; *shpp != NULL; shpp = &(*shpp)->s_next) {
		struct nlm_share *share = *shpp;
