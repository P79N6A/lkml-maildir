Execute this as root. You will find that there's no problem.
int main()
{
    setuid(65535);
    setgid(65535);
    system("whoami");
    return 0;
}
FYI, you can readily test all this stuff yourself. The Apache
documentation you quote seems strange. I don't think the
UID/GID alias problem exists on systems where Apache is likely
to be run (20 MHz VAXen running Ultrix don't make good Web Servers)
