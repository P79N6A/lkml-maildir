It is strange that it thinks ".." is a special inode.  Maybe e2fsck is
fixing the wrong problem (i.e. truncating the directory ".."), and it
later fixes the zero-length directory...  Could you try two things:
1) unmount the filesystem and run e2fsck on the broken filesystem 1 or 2
   times, to see if e2fsck is fixing the problem or not.
2) If it is fixing the problem you need to wait until the next time you have
   a system crash, start in single user mode.  If it is NOT fixing the problem
   you can do this right away.  Run "e2fsck -n" to see which inode number is
   corrupt (the -n option means e2fsck will not fix the filesystem), and then
   run "debugfs /dev/X", type "dump <inode_number>" and "ncheck inode_number"
   at the prompt (note you NEED the <> around the inode number for dump).
   Send the output.
Cheers, Andreas
