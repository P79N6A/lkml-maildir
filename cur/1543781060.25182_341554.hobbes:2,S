I am converting the ibmasm driver that uses (un)register_serial to use
serial_8250_(un)register_port. However I find function prototypes for
the new interfaces only in linux/drivers/char/8250.h. Is there a reason
there aren't any extern declarations for these functions in
linux/include/serial.h or linux/include/serial_8250.h?
thanks,
