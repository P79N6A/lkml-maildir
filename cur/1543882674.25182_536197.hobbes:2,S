Well the SC1200 has an ACB but it is disabled by default through one of
the gpio multiplex selector bits.  According to the data sheet only the
bios knows where that is.  So instead the gpio's (12 and 13) that are
multiplexed with acb #2 are driven by scx200_i2c using the bit banged
interface.  Makes it work for those of us that don't have access to
changing the bios.
Unfortuantely I don't think the scx200 gpio's have been rewritten to use
the new gpio interface.  If it was I would try to see if the new i2c
driver would work if told to use gpio 12 and 13.
scx200_i2c does depend on i2c-algo-bit so there is really very little
code inside scx200_i2c itself.  Does the new driver replace
i2c-algo-bit as well or does it use it?
