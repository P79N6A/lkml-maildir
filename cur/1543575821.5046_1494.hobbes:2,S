It can probably get cleaned up after 2.4 by making current() the actual 
inline. For 2.2 it won't change. Consider it a feature.
It was done originally because the 2.0 code using #define based current
generated better code than using inline functions. 2.2 upwards use a different
(far nicer) method to find current.
Note also that you cannot rely on 'get_current()'. The only way to find 
current is to use current. get_current() the inline is an x86ism.
