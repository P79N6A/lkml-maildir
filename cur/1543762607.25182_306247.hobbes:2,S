good.
I realize now I didn't answer your original question.
The reason ACPI now depends on PM is that
it makes it easier for us to do a more orderly shutdown --
acpi registers as a device so it can do some stuff
upon the PM device shutdowns -- before interrupts are disabled.
I think with all the twisty turney passages
related to the suspend states, poweroff, sys-req, and now kexec,
that it is best if we can keep the code paths as
common as possible or some of them will never get the
testing needed to prevent them from getting broken.
Also, it is now common practice to include PM && ACPI together
in the x86 world.  Though technically one could have
ACPI w/o PM and you'd have lost only ACPI_SLEEP, virtually
nobody seems to use/depend-on that combination.
Obviously I hadn't considered SN2 or built its config
before that 1-liner.  I'll be sure to build it next time.

yes.  this was in -mm a while back, but got pushed onto the back
burner when more pressing things came up.
