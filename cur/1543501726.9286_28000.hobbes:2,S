Hi Gianluca, hi Chiaki,
I'd like you to test 2.0d13.
http://www.garloff.de/kurt/linux/dc390/
It should fix the ac8 problems. 
Problem was that during the device scan, unneeded DCBs were removed, but a
little bit later, some fields inside were updated. This is been taken care
of, now.
Chiaki, I'd like to know, whether 2.0d13 behaves in case of medium errors,
now.
Regards,
