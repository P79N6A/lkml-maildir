And I perfectly agree with you :)
The problem is that the hrtimes is not my code, and I don't like doing
too many changes in code that I don't understand the consequences of. As
you showed me earlier, that the previous change broke the posix_timers.
So I really only did the bare minimum to fix what I considered a bug, and
let Thomas, John, Ingo or yourself do a proper fix.  Someone that
understands the timers better than I do.
Currently, it seems those people are too busy, and I just wanted a quick
fix.  I personally didn't like the patch, but my nose is stuck more into
the scheduling, memory and Ingo's rt_mutex now to spend time understanding
all the timer code. ;)

This was all I asked for.
