I need to be able to increase the number of MAX Processes available  -
currently it is set to 255 and I need to at least double that. I have heard
that there is a place to modify the source code or institute a patch to
allow this to happen. Please tell me if this is true, where in what module
(I am running version 2.2.1 kernel) and what value(s) to change.
