I can't be sure. It was my third attempt, and there seems to be some
sort of Makefile trouble in that area, which causes the problem to
appear and disappear at random, unless I do a make clean && make. But
the triggering commit was found with make clean && make, and I made sure
that reverting the resulting commit did actually solve the problem...
However I wasn't able to make the problem go away, by removing the
_PAGE_PWT constants from __PAGE_KERNEL_NOCACHE and
__PAGE_KERNEL_VSYSCALL_NOCACHE in include-asm/pgtable.h in the newest
2.6.25:

So while I'm fairly confident in that I bisected correctly, the number
of attempts I had to go through to get a reliable result, and the fact
that I cannot make the problem go away by reverting the current code to
something similar, counts quite a lot against me.
However I'm 100% confident that the problem appears between
cf8fa920cb4271f17e0265c863d64bea1b31941a and
925596a017bbd045ff711b778256f459e50a119, which is something like 16
commits. I have been at both points in the tree at least 2 times, and
confirmed that cf8fa920cb4271f17e0265c863d64bea1b31941a worked for me,
and 925596a017bbd045ff711b778256f459e50a119 didn't.

I'm sure that it fixed the problem for me, yes, and I'm fairly confident
that I ran make clean && make to compile the kernel during the entire
bisection between the two commites mentioned above.

$ cat /proc/cpuinfo
processor       : 0
vendor_id       : GenuineIntel
cpu family      : 6
model           : 15
model name      : Intel(R) Core(TM)2 Duo CPU     T7500  @ 2.20GHz
stepping        : 10
But I'm a bit puzzled by the fact that I'm aparently the only one how
have encountered the problem? Maybe it's only a problem if one also uses
PAE? (Thats just a wild guess to explain why I'm the only one seeing
this).
