They all have explicit MIT licenses on them, these files are only
dual-licensed by the fact that they are shipped with the kernel, but they
are MIT licensed and I would consider any changes to them to be MIT
licensed unless someone explicitly states it..
Similiar to the reiser notice on top of those files.. I think MIT license
is explicit enough...
Some files are GPL licensed like drm_sysfs as it is obivously derived from
GPL code,
Dave.
