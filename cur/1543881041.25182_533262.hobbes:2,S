If you remember, with 50/50, I noticed some difficulties to fork many
processes. I think that during a fork(), the parent has a higher probability
of forking other processes than the child. So at least, we should use
something like 67/33 or 75/25 for parent/child.
There are many shell-scripts out there doing a lot of fork(), and it should
be reasonable to let them keep some CPU to continue to work.
Also, I believe that (in shells), most forked processes do not even consume
a full timeslice (eg: $(uname -n) is very fast). This means that assigning
them with a shorter one will not hurt them while preserving the shell's
performance against CPU hogs.
