20% or so on kernel compiles. And what do you mean by "Worst case" in
this instance?
If the worst case is when the system is never idle, costs are a false
branch in each getpage.
One question is whether a never idle system represents an interesting
case. I suspect that it takes a very unusual load to get such a 
situation and that on, for example, smp servers where the zero page
cache will have the best results, it is the general case that there is a 
good bit of idle time.
