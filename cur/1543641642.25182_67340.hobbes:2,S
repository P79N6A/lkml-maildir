since you've disabled bonding, have you tried 
both interfaces or only one of them ? eg: if 
your system works fine on the tulip, it may be 
the other one behaving badly.

very old, it was one of the reasons I modified 
the driver a few years ago, and should be OK 
now.

well, I don't have much time to spend on this 
anymore, perhaps Chad Tindel has, but I doubt it. 
that's the reason why I nearly didn't work on 
the 2.4 port. But I still read reports, and 
sometimes reply :-) 
Cheers,
