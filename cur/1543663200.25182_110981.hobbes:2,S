which ac97 codec is on this board?  if it's an ALC650, check whether
the downmix switch is not set.
also, please check which chip is in fact from /proc/asound/cards.
the behvior of the driver depends on the chip model.
if it's really a VIA8235, i guess mplayer accessing to the first pcm
device, which supports only the front playback.  the multi-channel
playback is supported on the second pcm.
