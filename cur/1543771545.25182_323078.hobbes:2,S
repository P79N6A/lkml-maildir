One complication is some drivers will want to register a different
IRQ handler depending on if MSI is enabled or not.
If MSI is enabled (and usable), then some MMIO reads can be omitted.
I've posted a patch for tg3 driver:
	
ftp://ftp.parisc-linux.org/patches/diff-2.6.10-tg3_MSI-03
(Just an example! It was not accepted because of buggy HW
 though it worked great on the HW I have access to.)
drivers/infiniband/hw/mthca driver is another example.

How can the driver know which IRQ handlers to register?
