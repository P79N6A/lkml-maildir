If that's the only thing khttpd gains from being in the kernel then yes. Is the
sendfile syscall which exists right now somehow inferior to khttpd in terms of
raw speed and efficiency of outputing a file to a socket?
I was under the impression that khttpd had other reasons for going kernel mode
such as faster ability to get timestamps and what not on the file itself.
