Well not quite random.  It prunes the oldest entries.  The idea behind the prunable
callback is that some caches have specific aging methods.   What I tried to do here
was keep the rate of aging in sync with the VM.

Thats a question I have asked myself too.  What could be done is,  scan the 
entries in the slab encountered, using a call back, free them if they are purgeable.
If this ends up producing an empty slab, release it.

Looking at the Intermezzo dcache code, I think you made the right choise.
I do not think this needs a pruner method.
