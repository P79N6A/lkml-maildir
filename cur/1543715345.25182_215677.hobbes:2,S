Hi,
Maybe I am totally wrong, but I think that binary modules should (if they 
must exists) be divided into source (better opensource) interface and 
binary only part. But I think that majority of binary only drivers could 
be moved to user space in the great part. Some of them for example are in 
kernel only to allow to create new device and "bind" to it. The rest can 
be probably moved to userspace. Yes, there is performance issue, but only 
in some very rare cases: video cards and maybe something more. But modem 
drivers, vlan drivers, most raid drivers, archiving and versioning 
filesystem implementations, network filesystems (LUFS?), and probably more 
can be removed from kernel.
So I think that there should be some kind of special user-space processes 
that are userspace, have separate adress space, have some special 
scheduling rules (to make them more important than normal processes) and 
can interface with kernel better than normal processes (maybe they will 
have more special syscalls and some kind of callback functionality...).
The interface should allow create and "bind" to device, allocate memory 
region, dma, interrupt, port range, etc. This interface can be considered 
unstable and change with the kernel. There should be way to allow some 
process to do something and disallow to do everything else (to protect
from hidden secret code or simply broken driver). And the interface can be 
not very portable but should be highly extendable by vendors to allow them 
add other functionality to it (if vendor will make this functionality gpl 
and if it will be good it can be included into mainline kernel). This way 
vendors can cooperate with kernel developers.
What do you think?
