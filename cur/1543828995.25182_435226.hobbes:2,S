Re-reading this text, I'm getting some doubts whether the way Andrew 
handles this when merging patches is correct:
When Andrew merges some small fix into an existing patch in -mm
(e.g. "make a function static" or "fix a compile error"), he adds the 
Signed-off-by line of the small fix to the Signed-off-by lines of the 
patch.
But the submitter of the fix does not necessarly have checked the 
legal or technical status of the rest of the patch.
As an example, my only contribution to commit 
6b3934ef52712ece50605dfc72e55d00c580831a was making signal_cachep 
static, and I do refuse any legal or technical responsibility for 
the rest of the patch (this shouldn't imply the rest of the patch was 
bad - it's simply not me who can is responsible for it).
