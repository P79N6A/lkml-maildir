Not everyone believes in the OED's definitions.  I prefer Chambers (in
general), which has the (online) definition:
illegal adj
1 against the law; not legal. Also called unlawful.
2 not authorized by law or by specific rules which apply.
ETYMOLOGY: 17c: from Latin illegalis.
I believe the second definition would apply here.
