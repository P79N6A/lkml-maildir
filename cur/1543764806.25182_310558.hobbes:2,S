You're not missing anything, I did it that way on purpose. I thought it 
would be easier to do the expansion in the caller (who knows what it is 
they want to do with the end result).
But now that I look at merging, I realize that was actually the wrong
thing to do. A merge algorithm definitely wants to see the expanded tree,
since it will compare/join several of the diff-tree output things. 
So I'll either fix it or decide to just go with your version instead. I'm 
not overly proud.
