That's my view on the fpswa printk's (handle_fpu_swa): they are normal,
expected, and there is absolutely nothing that can be done about them --
so why print a "warning" about them (even if it is only 5 per second)?
If nothing else, toggle the meaning for IA64_THREAD_FPEMU_NOPRINT: turn it
ON for special apps.
Rate-limited unaligned loads in user space make a lot more sense, since
they _may_ point out issues in the code.
