Actually if you read the code for ip_fast_csum it's obvious what has
happened.  %o1 == iph->ihl contains the value 2 which is bogus.
[IPV4] raw: Strengthen check on validity of iph->ihl 
We currently check that iph->ihl is bounded by the real length and that
the real length is greater than the minimum IP header length.  However,
we did not check the caes where iph->ihl is less than the minimum IP
header length.
This breaks because some ip_fast_csum implementations assume that which
is quite reasonable.
