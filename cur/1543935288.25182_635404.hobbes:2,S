ata5: soft resetting port
The CPB resp_flags 0x2 entries are ones where the drive has been sent 
the request and the controller is waiting for a response. The timeout is 
30 seconds, so that means the drive failed to service those queued 
commands for that length of time.
It may be that your drive has a poor NCQ implementation that can starve 
some of the pending commands for a long time under heavy load?
