32bit uid quota is a harder one. Its probably something to be tackled after
2.4.15. There are a few other things like that which are lower priority 
because they are tricky, or because (eg the kiovec stuff) they are simply
performance boosts and can be done after we see 2.4.15 is solid
Other bits like the via timer fix are under further research
