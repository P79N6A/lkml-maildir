Hi all,
Sorry for disturbing you with my doubt.
I tried to insert a module(my own object file called dssp.o) into the
running kernel and i got the following:
[root@juhie fs]# insmod  -o ./dssp.o -f dssp
Using /lib/modules/2.2.14-12/fs/dssp.o
/lib/modules/2.2.14-12/fs/dssp.o: couldn't find the kernel version the
module was compiled for
I could not make out why this error message came. Please help me out with
this.
Thanks in advance
regards,
sathish
