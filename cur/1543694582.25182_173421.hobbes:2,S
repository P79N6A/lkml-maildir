    Hi all :))
    My excuses, I've had problems with my mail and lost the two
responses to my original mail. The fact is that I've already read the
manpage you say (console_codes(4)), but that page seems to be from
1996, so I was asking myself if a more recent referend existed.
    Is there any more up to date reference or any place in the source
code? Thanks for the answer anyway :))) and thanks in advance for all
your help, together with my excuses to the two persons who answered
for having lost their emails.
