Well, considering how fast we fill mailboxes on 1000+ people
subscribed on linux-kernel.... I'll merge two mails to one in order
not to fill peoples mailboxes at too big speed.

Sorry. Not acceptable. This is too big change in semantic. When I run
emacs as root, I want it to use all capabilities I have. When I run
cat /dev/zero > /dev/hda as root, I do not want kernel denying
operation because cat does not inherit "RAW DISK ACCESS"
capability. Sorry.
Still, if you took a look with code, you'd see that header is
read/used unconditionally. So lowering privileges always work. So if
root takes care and only uses executables containing the right header
(which do not need suid 0), he can get protection you wanted.

Ok, so you include capability header into named but don't mark it suid
0. Dropping privileges always work. Or you just put
loose_capabilities() at beggining of named's main().
Even if named has no capabilities, it is _still_ dangerous. It has uid
0 => it can send a signal to your init, and it can write to
/etc/passwd - because both init and passwd are owned by uid 0.

Agreed that storing uid in headers is ugly. I probably do not
understand capabilities model. I've seen paper, but I do not see why
it is good thing.

Look at code, privileges are dropped even if no suid 0 is present.
