Writing a GPL'ed driver sounds like a great project.
For a USB device I'd suggest you take a look at libusb for writing a
userspace driver as opposed to a kernelspace one. Userspace drivers
for USB devices are often preferable.
Also take a look at a few documents in the Documentation/ dir in the
kernel source:
  HOWTO
  SubmittingDrivers
  CodingStyle
If you can get docs for the device (or are able to reverse engineer
it) and get a driver done, more power to you. :-)
