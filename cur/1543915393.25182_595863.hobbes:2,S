Hi Mathieu
   Sorry I did not comment earlier on your email describing a generic 
tracer.  I believe that "trace" and your generic tracer could complement 
each other nicely.  The trace primitives could be expanded in the future 
to provide many of the features you described.  However, some of the 
features you describe are dependent on the format of the trace data 
itself (for example filtering), thus belong in a layer on top of trace.
Dave.
