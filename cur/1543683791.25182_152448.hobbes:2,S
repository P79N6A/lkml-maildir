means we _are_ obsoleted from now on...
if that's true I'll try to help you to use code from gpm where possible.
and I hope we can work together so we can use gpm once again.
(and possibly develop a buffer, which is available within
gpm and X...I am rethinking this currently)

think so, too. but in fact as my dmesg shows, the touchpad doesn't
like you..and I would like to use it :)
So, is /dev/input/mice now the general device to use?
If yes, is it imps2 or what should we talk to it?

good hint, at least somehow I can work with X & gpm..

Btw, aren't there any 'real' alternatives to xfree86?

...or xfree86 people have to change to gpl...
