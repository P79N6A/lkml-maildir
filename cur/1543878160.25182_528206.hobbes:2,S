Subject: [patch 2.6.21-rc6-git] at91_cf, minor fix
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/4/6/226

This is a minor correctness fix:  since the at91_cf driver probe() routine
is in the init section, it should use platform_driver_probe() instead of
leaving that pointer around in the driver struct after init section removal.

This is a refresh of a patch sent to the linux-pcmcia list on 15-February;
it seems that despite the MAINTAINERS file, that's not the place to send
patches.  (So what good is that list, and why is it in MAINTAINERS?)
