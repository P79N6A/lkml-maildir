Let's insert some fact in this discussion:
--- cut ---
Annual lease:
< 5 seats, $2490/seat/year.
5-15 seats, $1920/seat/year.
Lifetime Purchase:
< 5 seats, $5220/seat.
5-15 seats, $4230/seat.

Basically you charge a small(-ish) company about $25k for any
reasonable license. This is about as much as we spent for Software in
the last seven years (we do own a few Windows and Office licenses).
bk might be interesting for larger companies with software budgets in
the six figure range and for open source. For the vast number of three
to five developers enterprises, it's simply unreasonably priced. For
25k$ I get about six man months from a really good developer to work
on <insert your SCM here>.
