Hi all,
I see this has been raised before, but could not find a closure thread:
e.g.
include/asm/bitops.h:79: warning: read-write constraint does not allow a 
register
Since moving 2.6.15.7 --> 2.6.16.4 I get truck loads of these warnings.
nick@linuxamd:linux$ gcc -v
Reading specs from /usr/lib/gcc/i486-slackware-linux/3.4.0/specs
Configured 
with: ../gcc-3.4.0/configure --prefix=/usr --enable-shared --enable-threads=posix --enable-__cxa_atexit --disable-checking --with-gnu-ld --verbose --target=i486-slackware-linux --host=i486-slackware-linux
Thread model: posix
gcc version 3.4.0
nick@linuxamd:linux$ ld -v
GNU ld version 2.15.90.0.3 20040415
There is no problem as kernels built with these warnings are fine, so a GCC 
issue I presume?
Nick
