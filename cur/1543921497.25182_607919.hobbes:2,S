That's right. I do depmod on i386 and amd64 for _all_ Debian architectures 
without any problems and I don't see why it should be a problem when running 
on other arches. It used to be a problem with depmod from modutils, but with 
depmod from module-init-tools it works perfectly.
All it needs is the -b option and correct kernel version.
