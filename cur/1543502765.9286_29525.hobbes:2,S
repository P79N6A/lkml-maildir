I'm using this... It generates pt_regs struct on stack (and prints
them+stacktrace). If you need them in some structure, you have to
fill it manually - there is no library function AFAIK (patch is for
2.3.11-pre3):

You are out of luck. You have to add an IPI operation `store my registers
somewhere'. Or, you can (with new TSSes) change IPI interrupt to task
gate and prepare dummy TSS, which can do (1) endless loop or (2) execute
old IPI proc and iret. Then send IPI... In both cases, old TSS will be filled
with registers at time of IPI. Or you can change timer interrupt or anything
else, but IPI comes to my mind as it is delivered to all (or specific) cpus.

If it is `complete crash' postcrash, I think that TSS with endless loop
is best. You kill two problems with this: (1) other CPUs will stop doing
damage in memory and (2) you'll get their registers... (and (3) you can
revive them after that by simple overwritting endless loop with iret).
                                                 Best regards,
                                                    Petr Vandrovec

P.S.: It is i386 specific, of course. You have to code it for every
architecture you support (as each architecture has different registers
and different IPI mechanism).
