	Thanks for you patch. It was added at V4L tree, available at
http://linuxtv.org/downloads/quilt
	Please notice that in v4l tree, compat32 functions were moved to
drivers/media/video/compat_ioctl32.c, and will be sent to kernel after
more tests.
	Please test all compat32 patches to check it if works properly. They
are at the beginning of patches/series files (against -rc5 or -git):
patches/v4l_0926_2_compat32_ioctl.diff
patches/v4l_0957_subject_compat_ioctl32_installation_fixes.patch
