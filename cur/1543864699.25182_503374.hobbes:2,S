I would much rather see a driver bit rot due to lack of interest than
see hardware go to the scrap heap because the vendor stoped caring about
it and you are SOL.  Happens every time a new windows version comes out.
lots of working hardware suddenly becomes useless.  At least on linux I
can keep using it if I want to until I decide not to try and maintain
the driver (if no one else is doing it).  A driver with bitrot is a lot
better than no driver at all.
