Ok, I agree with this one, but won't dare to apply it right now. Remind me 
post-2.6.11, or - even better - see if one of the alternate trees wants to 
fix and test this (-mm, -ac, vendors, who-ever).
And testing the dang thing sounds wonderful.
Andreas' testprogram is a good place to start, probably coupled with some
test-files with really really long lines or something..
