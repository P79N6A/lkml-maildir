OK, just a few thoughts...
1. Both -mm3 and -np2 suffer from delays when redrawing "damaged"
windows (windows which were covered and now are being exposed): while
moving heavily a window over the screen, "damaged" windows are not
redrawn. I would say this is a sign of starvation. However, this does
not happen with -ck3 that is able to redraw "damaged' windows even while
heavily moving a window all over the screen.
I can see this by looking at some icons that are lying on my desktop.
With -mm3 and -np2, they are hardly redrawn while heavily moving a
window all around. With -ck3, I can see the icons and their respective
labels all the time.
2. Both -mm3 and -np2 show a very smooth behavior when moving windows
all around the screen. However, -ck3 is somewhat a little bit jerky. I
think this is a consequence of point number 1.
3. Both -mm3 and -ck3 are inmune to CPU hogs when mantaining
interactivity: running "while true; do a=2; done" doesn't seem to affect
the interactive behavior of them. I check this by running this CPU hog
and hovering my mouse over KXDocker, which is a nice applet for KDE
similar to the Mac OS X docker. KXDocker is another CPU hog by itself,
but plays nicely with the "while true" loop. However, -np2 seems to
suffer a little bit from starvation, as KXDocker animations don't feel
smooth.
