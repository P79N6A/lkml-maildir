Can you also try with -no-kvm-irqchip?
You will need to comment out the lines
    /* ISA IRQs map to GSI 1-1 except for IRQ0 which maps
     * to GSI 2.  GSI maps to ioapic 1-1.  This is not
     * the cleanest way of doing it but it should work. */
    if (vector == 0)
        vector = 2;
in qemu/hw/apic.c (should also fix -no-kvm smp).  This will change kvm 
wakeups to use signals rather than the in-kernel code, which may be buggy.
