This thread initially started out talking about USB device allocation and
has since evolved into a passionate debate on the pros and cons of devfs
vs. no devfs. My comments are more oriented towards the former.
I've not personally used devfs so I can't comment on its strong or weak
points; however, Solaris 2.x (/devices) and Irix 6.5 have (/hw)
hardware-graph type fs scenarios to which /dev files are symlinked and it
seems to work well enough.
Anyway, assuming an enivornment where devices are quite static and don't
change more than a month at a time, while fine for some doesn't reflect
other configurations which will become more common in the near future. USB
but scratches the surface of the dynamic device allocation problem (and
the limitations of 16 bit minor devices).
Take for example, a switched Fibre Channel fabric configuration (such as
the one here at the University of Minnesota which changes VERY often
during develoment and test work). The Fibre Channel standard allows:
  239 switches per fabric, 255 ports per switch, 126 devices per port
Even accounting for interswitch links, that's about 7.6 million disk
drives (or other devices) that could, in theory, be connected to one host.
Those drives can move from one switch port to another switch port or from
one switch to another switch on the fly. Further, the topology of the
fabric can change on the fly. A device naming and allocation system which
accounts for this would be great. Neither Solaris nor Irix handle this
right now, it'd be nice if Linux could handle it whatever the solution
finally is.
