How about a simple workaround for now:
$(obj)/vmlinux: $(obj)/$(HEAD) $(obj)/piggy.o $(obj)/vmlinux.lds \
                $(addprefix $(obj)/, $(OBJS))
	cp $(obj)/piggy.o .
        $(call if_changed,ld)
	rm piggy.o
I onther words just make a temporary copy of piggy.o in current directory.
No changes needed in .lds file.
Untested!
I do not know the linker command language, but I assume there is some
way to do this even with piggy.o located somewhere else than current
directory.
My suggestion is a simple workaround to make the arm kernel compile, not
something I would like to see as a permanent solution.
