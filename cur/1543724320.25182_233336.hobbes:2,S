0 when casted or assigned to a pointer will be converted to the null
pointer value by the compiler, that's why doing !ptr is equivalent to
ptr == NULL, even if ptr points to address 0xffffffff virtual in
reality. Still NULL is set to (void *) 0, or alternatively (void *) -1UL
(thought the latter I'm not 100% sure but I think it'll work in such a
case).
It's mostly theory though, I've never seen an arch with a compiler with
a null pointer not actually meaning virtual address 0UL (that's why we
used a C-breaking #define NULL ((void*)-1UL) once we needed it).
