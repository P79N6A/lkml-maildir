It looks like a timeout problem.  The ack (fa) arrived 11 ticks after
the byte (00) was sent, but it looks like the timeout is only 10 ticks.
Try playing with the timeout in atkbd_sendbyte (line 217 of
drivers/input/keyboard/atkbd.c).

Both keyboards responded to the command, perhaps???
I'd suggest that we don't even ask the keyboard what scancode set it is
using if we are attempting to use set 2.
