I found it out:
Memory detection code was not working properly. Therefore system tried
to use memory which just was not there (it contained fixed
~0). "Wonderfull" thing was that system went to full multiuser mode,
so it could actually trash data on disk very fast. Here's "memory
checker" code -- just good enough to catch ROM :). I think performing
memcheck at boot might be good idea: this is not my first problem with
memory detection...
