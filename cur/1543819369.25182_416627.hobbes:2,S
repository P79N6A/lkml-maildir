Nothing nowadays does round-robin of interrupts, either the in-kernel
or userspace balancers ... but we do migrate them occasionally (in the
order of 1s or so)

Because *something* has to be balanced, and moving processes around
is expensive too. Personally I find the process model cleaner, but
maybe it's less efficient - you'd also add extra overhead for accounting
to each interrupt, which we don't do now.
I'm not claiming that moving irqs is worse or better than moving
processes - just that it's a tradeoff, both suck. Perhaps the
real answer is that we shouldn't be getting that many interrupts
anyway - technologies like NAPI and simpler device interrupt collation
should reduce the load, and most of the work should be done in the
back-ends anyhow (though those are often locally bonded to the CPU
the irq arrived on).
