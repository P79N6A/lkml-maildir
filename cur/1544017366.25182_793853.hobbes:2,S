Having thought about it some more, we can't necessarily pin the blame on the
key management code.  I think it more likely due to the previous owner of the
page as it's the guard poisoning that got corrupted, not the allocated key
struct.  The problem is we don't know who that was.  I wonder if it's
practical to store a recent history of page allocs and releases in a circular
buffer.
