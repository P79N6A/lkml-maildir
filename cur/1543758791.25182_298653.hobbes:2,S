The fact that this new approach serialises the stable/devel lineation
whereas traditionally it was parallel (2.x.y/2.x+1.y) is going to be
a real pain for a lot of maintainers.
In short, instead of a single 'merge with linus tree', I'm now going to
need a 'merge with linus' and 'merge with linus next time' tree for every
tree I maintain.. It's not impossible to maintain, but its extra burden.
Burden which a lot of folks may consider not worth it.
