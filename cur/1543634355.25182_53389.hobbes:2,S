Well, the fix is sadly simple: switching to a spare 3c905C-TX seems to
have eliminated the problem. Copying the contents of claymore:/pack (a
directory with lots of big RPMs and tarballs and other miscellany) to
rapier:/scratch is super-fast and error-free. This directory includes a
few files (such as the Chaos SoundFont) that killed the transfer
yesterday.
Once I receive my new chassis, I'll move rapier's guts to it and start
testing with FreeBSD 4.6 to try to determine whether the problem is
linked to this particular /hardware/ configuration, or if it's something
in the Linux kernel and/or drivers. I'll also swap around network cards
to try and determine if this is some sort of strange interaction between
the 3c59x and e100/eepro100 drivers.
