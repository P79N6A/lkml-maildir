My Hg tree was outdated by your patches.  If you look at the time, I made
that fix on Jul 20th, then your comprehensive patch on Jul 23rd
incorporated that part of the fix.

I know, that's why I attached a version to my email that would.  I have now
re-done my tree to take into account the current code.

There was a check in bttv-driver.c that would skip
class_device_create_file() for older kernels (it got the version wrong, but
same idea).  I just moved this check into compat.h so that the bttv code
wouldn't be as cluttered.  My change shouldn't make any difference at all
for bttv under 2.4.  It is just to clean up the code; put compat stuff in
compat.h and not in the drivers when possible.
Other code which called c_d_c_f() will now skip it the same way bttv did
under old kernels.  All the class_device stuff doesn't exist under 2.4, and
there will be a hundred class_device related breakages.  So maybe this
patch fixes one of those hundred breakages.
