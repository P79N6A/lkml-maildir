In fact, it makes the problem worse.

This is the core problem - it does not cause any improvement w.r.t.
running out of memory. It does avoid some unrelated theoretical problem -
but that's not the point here.

Quite.

I disagree with this bit - it will make the problem worse on any given
configuration. For example, forking a load of Apache processes in 64Mb of
RAM, no swap is fine with overcommit - but will cause OOM problems without
overcommit. Certainly no improvement!
