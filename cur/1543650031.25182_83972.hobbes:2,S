I have seen the same on a precompiled slackware 8.1 raid.s kernel I tried
for my promise controller. It's an AMD AthlonXP 2000+. Like you I found that
the PIII_SSE was slower than the P5_MMX and still got selected. I got higher
numers than you though, around your old mobo's speeds.... (KT333 chipset).
(MSI KT3 Ultra2-R). specs are in the KT333, IO-APIC, Promise Fasttak, Initrd
topic.
the 5 disks spanning ram image doesn't even load properly with me, maybe
it's caused by memory problems as well? Tho' I thought north bridges are for
memory access whilst I only get a message that my southbridge isn't
recognized...
