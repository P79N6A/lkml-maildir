Seems to me that you are not testing what apps see. Internal benchmarks
are useful only for figuring out how to remove bottlenecks that 
effect actual user apps - in my humble opinion of course.
The nice thing about my benchmark is that it actually tests something
useful - how well you can do periodic tasks. BTW, on RTLinux we get 
under 100 microseconds on even 50Mhzx PPC860 - 17us on a 800Mhz K7.
I'd be happy to see some decent numbers in Linux, but you gotta 
measure something more applied.
