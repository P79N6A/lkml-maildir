Subject: [PATCH] tmpfs: fix mounts when size is less than the page size
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/11/3/123

When tmpfs is mounted with a size less than one page the number of blocks
is set to 0 which makes the tmpfs mount unlimited. This can lead to a quick
and surprising death is someone typos a tmpfs mount command and writes to much.
tmpfs can still be mounted as unlimited if size or nr_blocks is exactly 0.
