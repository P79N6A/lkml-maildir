Thanks for looking into this.  It has been exactly the PITA the
original poster described for me, for years on all distro's.
It seems the scenario is that if everything is on local time, its not a
problem, but if the system is set to run its hardware clock on grenwich
time, a crash leaves the hw clock afu because its on local time at the
reboot init.
I did something to my init script to quasi-fix this years ago, fix now
lost in the sands of time as this FC2 install is truely long in the
tooth now.  But it works, so I don't fix it. :)
I *think* the problem is that the assumption of grenwich time is only
at boot, and shutdown times.  At boot, I believe the hw clock is reset
to local time after getting the time reference from it, and at shutdown
its reset to grenwich. So a crash recovery finds it on local time but
assumes its grenwich & the result is a predictable mess.
If thats the case, then IMNSHO, the hw clock should ALWAYS be on
grenwich time.  This needless twiddling is rather counter-productive.
