Yes.  Assuming that you're reporting the comparison of two single bitmaps:
"The on-disk bitmap and the correct bitmap differ."
"The on-disk and the correct bitmap differ."
"The on-disk bitmap differs from the correct bitmap."
I'd say the last of those three sounds best; the second sounds a little 
stilted because you have to think for a moment to realise that "on-disk" is 
being used as a contraction of "on-disk bitmap."
If the difference is between two sets of bitmaps:
"The on-disk bitmaps and the correct bitmaps differ."
"The on-disk and the correct bitmaps differ."
"The on-disk bitmaps differ from the correct bitmaps."
Matt (and that's the last you'll hear from me on this one; there's enough 
traffic on here as it is...)
