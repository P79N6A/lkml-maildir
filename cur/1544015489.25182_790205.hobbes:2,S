How do you generate the config for 2.6.27-* and the other versions that
fail? You should normally just use the .config for 2.6.26.2 or whatever
you used last and run 'make oldconfig' selecting the default answer to
each new option unless you have a good reason not to and have read and
understood the help text that goes along with the option. This way you
wouldn't have run into the problem with kernel mode setting either.
And still, even if it is not a problem with a network driver but in
another part of the network layer etc. a bisection run would be a good
way to pinpoint the issue. But see if it is not your config that causes
the problem first.
