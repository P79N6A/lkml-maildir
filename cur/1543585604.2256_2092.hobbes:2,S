Thanks Alan, but no dice.  Most of the stuff on the board is autodetect
anyway, but even after a reset it exhibited the same behaviour.
Windows, however, continues to run fine.  It's not properly set up with
all the various drivers installed though, so its probably running with the
equivalent of a 486 kernel as well.
I tried rebuilding with K6-II as the cpu type instead of K7, that works
fine.  Is there any data in particular you'd like me to collect or
experiments you'd like me to try?
