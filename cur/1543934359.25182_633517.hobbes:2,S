Subject: Why is deleting (or reading) files not counted as IO-Wait in top?

Hi
Currently i'm deleting about 500.000 files on a XFS-filesystem which 
takes a few minutes, as i had a top open i saw that 'wa' is shown as 
0.0% (Nothing else running currently) and everything except 'id' is near 
the bottom too. Kernel is 2.6.23.11.
So, as 'rm -rf' is essentially a IO (or seek, to be more correct)-bound 
task, shouldn't that count as "Waiting for IO"?
The man-page of top says:
'Amount of time the CPU has been waiting for I/O to complete.'
But AFAICT wa only seams to be (ac)counted for writing and not for 
reading. I come to that conclusion because, when i fire 'sync' i can see 
some percent wa for a few seconds.
Bis denn
