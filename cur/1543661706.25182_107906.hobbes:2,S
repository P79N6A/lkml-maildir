A 'spare time' project of mine is to get -W builds at least 'mostly clean'
The low hanging fruit got fixed up a while back. Most of the remainder
is signed comparison warnings.  gcc-3.4 has promoted this warning to
show up in regular builds too, so at some point, either a lot of effort
is going to have to be undertaken to fix those, or we use -Wno-signed-compare
during builds.

Just for giggles I did a quick audit of the results of a make
allyesconfig a few weekends ago. The number of drivers we still have
that need updating to new APIs (from tqueue conversions to cli/sti etc)
is quite disturbing. There's a lot of groundwork to be done there
hopefully before we get to a 2.6test phase, or we're going to be
obsoleting boatloads of drivers.
I meant to clean up the output and feed it all into bugzilla.
I'll get around to it sometime..
