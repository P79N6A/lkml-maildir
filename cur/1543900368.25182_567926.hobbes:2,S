just as a test, does this go away if you:
	renice -20 pidof `Xorg`
i.e. is this connected to the way X is scheduled?
Another thing to check would be whether it goes away if you set the 
granularity to some really finegrained value:
    echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/sched_wakeup_granularity_ns
    echo 500000 > /proc/sys/kernel/sched_granularity_ns
this really pushes things - but it tests the theory whether this is 
related to granularity.
