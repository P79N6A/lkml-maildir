Both warnings occurred when the kernel was tearing down large amounts of
pagecache via invalidate_inode_pages().  One instances was a blockdev
(probably the final close on the dvd) and the other was a regular file
(perhaps a large dvd image?)
The CPU is slow: 500MHz pIII.  How much memory does it have?
So the kernel was doing a lot of work, on a slow CPU.  Perhaps that simply
exceeded the softlockup timeout.  If that's true then the machine should
have recovered.  Once it did, and once it didn't.  I don't know why it
didn't.
