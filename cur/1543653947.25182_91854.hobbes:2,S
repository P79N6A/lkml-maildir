The new module loader makes kernel debugging much harder.
There is no section information available, which means ...
* ksymoops cannot decode oops in modules.  Without section data, there
  is no way to reliably determine where module symbols were loaded.
* kgdb cannot debug modules.  gdb needs to know which modules are
  loaded and where each section of each module starts.
* kdb cannot display the section for a symbol.  Which means the user
  cannot do
    objdump -j <section_name> --adjust-vma=<start_address> module
  to map the code to the original object and source.
The complete lack of kernel and module symbols (no /proc/ksyms) means
that ksymoops is now useless on 2.5 kernels.  If you get an oops in a
kernel built without kksymoops, there is no way to decode the oops.
Big step backwards, Rusty.
