I'm not sure I like these kinds of patches.
I _like_ the code being readable. The fact that the compiler can optimize 
away one of the tests if the type is right is fine. It seems to be 
draconian to remove code that is correct and safe, especially when the 
code has no real downsides to it.
Do we have a compiler that needlessly complains again? 
Sometimes it is the _complaints_ that are bogus.
