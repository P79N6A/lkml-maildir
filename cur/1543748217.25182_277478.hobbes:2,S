You are only thinking in terms of single process characteristics like
will it exit and think times, the inter-process characteristics are very
hap hazard. You might find the applied code easier to read, I think.

The patch scripts case is interesting, last night (when committing other
patches) I was thinking I should try and bench that today. It has a good
mix of reads and writes.
There's still lots of tuning in the pipe line. As I wrote originally,
this was basically just a quick hack that I was surprised did so well
:-) It has grown a little since then and I think the concept is really
sound, so I'll continue to work on it.
