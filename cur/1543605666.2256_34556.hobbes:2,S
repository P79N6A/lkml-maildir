I keep hearing this type of reasoning.  It flat-out doesn't work
this way in the legal system.  This is similar to arguing that
you didn't really stab someone if you threw the knife instead
of holding it. ("But your honor, once the knife left my hand
it really wasn't under my control...")
If your actions bring about the result, whether
directly or indirectly, you are legally liable for the
consequences.
