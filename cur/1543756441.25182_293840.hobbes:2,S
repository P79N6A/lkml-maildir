Well, basically we need to ensure that when CPUSETs are marked "mems_exclusive" 
that no one else in the system is allowed to allocate from those "exclusive" 
nodes.  This can't be guaranteed without hooks in the allocation code much like 
what Paul has already written in his CPUSETs patchset.

I believe my mailer is line-wrapping correctly, but it's hard to be sure 
without feedback.  I switched to Thunderbird last week, and I think I've 
(un)checked all the appropriate boxes.  And yes, line wrapping is splendid. 
Splendiferous, even.
