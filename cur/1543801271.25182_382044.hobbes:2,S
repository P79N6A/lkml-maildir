And what would it look like? I would prefer all functions being 
alsa_simple_* because a user could read interface documentation 
alphabetically and see all the relevant functions as they are adjacent.
I would correct my earlier 'frames_in_period' to 'latency_in_frames' because
most users are not interested in period size. Latency on the other hand 
matters. 10ms latency would just be samplingrate / 100 and the ALSA lib 
would choose good approximate period/buffer sizes internally. Those who 
need something better should just use the old way.
