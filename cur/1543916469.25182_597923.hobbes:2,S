NAK.
This busticates some pretty subtle code in mm/slab.c that uses
uses __builtin_return_address() for debugging - if you do this, then
the "calling function" gets listed as "kcalloc()" rather than the much more
useful "function that called kcalloc()" (which is what you care about).
(I remember going around and around multiple times getting those stupid
inlines set up right, so that feature actually did something useful, otherwise
kcalloc and kzalloc didn't report where they were called from).
