camera formatted info

Warning: partition 1 extends past end of disk
If it's 488 cylinders, then it should start at 0 and end at 447,
not 449.
It looks like some kind of driver error to begin with. The
fact that it sometimes works should be overlooked until the
driver returns the correct number of cylinders (the same
number that the formatting utility gets). Check to see if
your driver could return a different disk size under different
conditions.
