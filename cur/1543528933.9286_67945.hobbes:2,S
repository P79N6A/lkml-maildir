No, AFAIK. UDI was discussed some time ago but noone was overly entusiastic.
Looks like UDI is dieing silently. Since most kernel developers are actively
against UDI as replacement for current driver API and in other form UDI is not
very usefull UDI is looking more and more like "nice theory never to be used
on practice". And it's good thing IMHO.
