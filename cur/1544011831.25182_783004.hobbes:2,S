Please don't do this kind of dependency garbage. The only dependency this
device has is on the maple bus, there is nothing inherently dreamcast
specific about it.
CONFIG_MAPLE already has the dreamcast dependency in this case, and I
would speculate the only reason that you added the dreamcast dependency
was to work around the fact that select would complain on plaforms where
the MAPLE symbol is not visible.
This is an indicator that select is not the thing you should be using
here in the first place. So, just change this to depends on MAPLE and be
done with it. As soon as you have to start mixing and matching
depends/selects that already have a dependency on each other, you have
already lost.
