That's the only option I'm now aware of. I suspect it may make sense to
try it to get a notion of just how large the performance impact is so
it's cost can be properly weighed against the expected stability
benefit. But it's also worth noting that with some care the additional
fault may be circumvented in some performance-relevant instances.
