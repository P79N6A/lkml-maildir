That is probably because libgcc contained some stuff which was unsuitable
for the kernel on x86.

Ah, are you saying that the only thing that libgcc.a is used for is
supposidly slow division routines?  Some architectures need it for much
much more than that.

No.  libgcc.a is dependent on the compiler.  I do know that code generated
with one ARM gcc compiler does not work with the libgcc.a of a later
compiler, suggesting that there is a difference in the API between the
two versions of GCC.  Hence, the only real way to get the correct behaviour
in this case is to use libgcc.a for ARM.
