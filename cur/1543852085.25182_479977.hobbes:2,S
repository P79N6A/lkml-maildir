Why should they?
The filename (actually and more to the point: the i-node) in the
filesystem is just an "anchor" so that the clients can find the server
(if you have several servers on your system, they *must* have different
filenames to bind(2) to).

Probably (because I didn't look at source code) because every connect(2)
and/or accept(2) sys-call increments it.
And BTW I assume that you meand the in memory ref count, not the one in
the inode on the disk (which is incremented with hardlinks).
