In my case, I use it to test parts of my memory controller patches on an
emulated NUMA machine. I plan to use it to test out page migration
across nodes.

Yes, you are right. I merely followed the strstr convention already
present, which as you righly point out is wrong. I suspect I need to do
something like
p = strstr(p, "fake=")
if (p)
	cmdline = p + 5;
This would still allow us to do things like
numa=foo,fake=bar but the memparse() utility would fail at fake=bar
								^^^
or even
numa=debug,fake=1G
I suspect that this should be good enough for a command line option.
