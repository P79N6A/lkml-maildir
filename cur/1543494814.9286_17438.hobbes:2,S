My machine must have no swap at all and I'm wondering
how the kernel  acts if physical memory is needed.
I think data pages are untouched: otherwise they'd be lost.
But what about  code pages? Are these  flushed and
then reloaded from the actual disk executable, or kept
in memory? And in the last case, how does the
memory manager deal with "out of memory" issue?
Thanks in advance. Maurizio Berti
