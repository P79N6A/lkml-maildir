Ah so you are thinking about two equally powered devices
competing for the channel. Something I would call the "sumo fight"
situation. Well disks didn't use the "sleeping" mechanism at all anyway
and the chances someone would do cp from CD-ROM to CD-ROM are low.
Finally I think that the proper granularity of scheduling requests to
the drive is, well, the request layer. The queue processing layer should
handle this becouse otherwise we would have two "competing" optimization
mechanisms. And there we are indeed able to actually relinquish some CPU 
time. If you look at an request processing optimization as a low pass
signal filter it's immediately obvious that the effects of chaining them
can be, well at least "counter intuitive".
