I am currently loading and unloading a prototype like security module
on a regular basis. The fact that such a module can be loaded and
unloaded (albeit in an unsecure way) greatly simplifies development.
Thus this change will adversely affect me and probably also others that
develop LSMs.
Additionally deployment of and choice among legitimate security modules
that may or may not (yet) be part of the main kernel tree is simplified by
an option to load these security modules (e.g. at boot time) into a running
kernel. This way a distribution can provide AppArmor, SELinux, SecLevl and
whatever as options very much in the same way that this works for a driver.

You asked for oppinion. I do not plan to engage in any flamewars.
