Instead of this "kludge" every time you want to declare a waitq, I
recommend putting this at the top:
#ifndef DECLARE_WAITQUEUE
#define DECLARE_WAITQUEUE(wait, current) \
	struct wait_queue wait = { current, NULL }
#endif
That way you have as little as possible "ifdefs" in the main code. 
You've already done that with ALPHA_KLUDGE_MCR, which is good.
