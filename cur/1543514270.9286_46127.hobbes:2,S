Hi guys,
This 2.2.13 patch[1] adds bzlib (bzip2) decompression support to the
kernel, in linux/lib/bz, and allows you to compress your initrd images
with bzip2 instead of gzip.
Any testing or feedback on this patch would be greatly appreciated.
There is a companion patch[2] to mkinitrd 2.0, which comes with RedHat
6.0, which adds bzip2 compression, variable initrd image size, and some
other features.
Regards,
	Jeff
