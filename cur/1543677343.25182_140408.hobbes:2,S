Maybe "nobody" isn't a "real" user in your case. If there is some problem
with it, you may end up with uid 0 after "su nobody".
check the output of the command "id" after the executiong the su command,
just to be safe in any case!
If su really worked correctly, the exploit may not even work if you
su (successfully) su'ed from root.
