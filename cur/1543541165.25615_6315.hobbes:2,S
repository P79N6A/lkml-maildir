 Just look at the code:
handle_sysrq(ch, regs, NULL, NULL);
break_pressed = 0;
goto ignore_char;
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
We just dropped the character regradless of whether handle_sysrq()
actually did anything.

 For the keyboard -- yes.  Nobody expects pressing SysRq and another key
simultaneously producing a keypress event for the other key.
 For the serial line -- no.  A sequence of BREAK and than a character
within a few seconds is a valid event.  And I want to keep SysRq
compiled-in and disabled all the time so that I can enable it and get a
register dump or a task list in case something goes wrong.

 After a bit of thinking I agree this is not a major misbehaviour and if I
nothing breaks due to it, for the sake of simplicity we may keep things as
they are now.

 BREAK is an asynchronous event and you may get one even when there are
unreceived characters in the FIFO.  I'm not sure how 8250 clones handle it
-- I can't recall the null byte but I'd have to look up docs again.  Some
chips put a null character at the front, indeed.
