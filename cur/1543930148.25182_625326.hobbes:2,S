note that there are a couple of existing patches in this area. One is 
the fix below. There's also older frequency-scaling TSC patches - i'll

Subject: x86: idle wakeup event in the HLT loop
From: Ingo Molnar <mingo@elte.hu>
do a proper idle-wakeup event on HLT as well - some CPUs stop the TSC
in HLT too, not just when going through the ACPI methods.
