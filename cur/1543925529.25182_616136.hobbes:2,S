"The right thing" in the correct context.
It was discussed to keep ARCH={i386,x86_64} and the point I have
is that if we are going to extend ARCH=... to be useable to
specify kernel bit size then it should be done in a generic way
and not like it was done before on x86.
I do not consider the discussion about keeping/dropping
ARCH={i386,x86_64} as concluded.
And if we decide on keeping ARCH={i386,x86_64} then I have
questioned the semantics. Clear opinions are missing..
ARCH= semantic
Impact                   before             now
================================================
32/64 bit                 yes               yes
bzImage location          yes               no
different Kconfig files   yes               no
decide defconfig          yes               yes
asm symlink               no                no
build option              yes               no [1]
[did I miss anything? I think I did]
[1] ARCH=... select 32/64-bit during configuration.
    There is no difference between ARCH={x86,i386,x86_64}
    when building the kernel because the 32/64 bit
    choice is done at configuration time.
The table above reflect the [now] semantics with the
patches that is present at lkml.
And the patch needed to implment the above
semantic (after the preparational stuff which
is generic) are:
$ git diff --stat HEAD~1..HEAD
 Makefile                 |   18 ++++++++++++++----
 arch/x86/Makefile        |    8 ++++++--
 scripts/kconfig/Makefile |    2 +-
 3 files changed, 21 insertions(+), 7 deletions(-)
The scripts/kconfig/Makefile change is a bugfix that maybe
should be included in another patch. It is not x86 specific.
So 19 additional lines and 5 deleted lines to introduce the
ARCH= semantics above.
