Yes it works!!!! Finally the nforce2 issue has been fixed. I still can't 
believe it.
Dear Allen, it is nice that after all Nvidia decided to give out 
information about this issue. I would have been so nice, if this had 
been doen about 6 months ago, where I originally discovered the 
connection between apic instability and cpu disconnect. But I guess I 
shouldn't scold Nvidia but the mainboard manufacturers who were still 
sleeping, like in my case: Abit. Till today the didn't manage to fix 
this issue and the timer issue (and they released a new bios a few days 
ago...)
Maybe Nvidia should scold the board manufacturers to keep their bioses 
updated. After all it is Nvidia getting a bad image if everybody thinks 
"Nvidia boards are unstable and they don't care to resplve it." So it 
would be in Nvidia's own interest to push the manufacturers to integrate 
such critical fixes ASAP.
The only issues left for me are
a) semi-stable nvidia binary driver
b) higher idle temperature with nvidia driver (I guess). I may also be a 
sensors probelm as Abit's reading is known as not to be very precise and 
read something else after every reboot thanks to new recalibration.
c) missing driver for nforce2 apu...
Thanx after all.
