insmod -m is good for testing a single module but its output is
(a) incompatible with /proc/ksyms
(b) only does one module at a time
(c) option -m is only useful for manual loads, not for modprobe
(d) you get no indication when a module is removed.
On the other hand ksymoops 0.7 can build a complete and verified
System.map including modules, especially if you use modutils 2.3 to get
decent /proc/ksyms entries.  Try
  ksymoops -V -s saved.map < /dev/null
and look at the saved.map file.
I know it is a little confusing to use ksymoops to build a map instead
of having a modutils tool to do it.  However the ability for
non-hackers to run ksymoops on a log file without running another
utility first is more important, so ksymoops builds its own map.  There
is no point in duplicating the code in a second component so there is
no modutils tool to produce a complete map.
