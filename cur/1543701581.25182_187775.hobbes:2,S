Look that this is not true. If one core is not running any task, the idle 
task (if not polling) does "hlt" and the "what they call Fetch And 
Deliver" engine will be dedicated to the other core. Also, because the 
halted core not not issue any op to the execution engine, full resources 
will be available for the running task. There are many docs available 
inside the Intel developer web site that explain this.
