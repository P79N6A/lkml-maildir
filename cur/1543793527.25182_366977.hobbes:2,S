They timeout, and X usually goes straight back in there again, I can't
remember the codepath exactly at this stage but it just goes round and
round until you kick the machine..
in theory X should probably deal with the situation better... I think it
might be able to at least gracefully die or reset the chip...

Yes, usually if a kernel introduced it it is because I've done something
really dumb (shouldn't happen too often and with radeons we usually catch
that before stable releases), or because the X server wasn't using DRI
before due to a too old DRM and suddenly the new DRM appears in the kernel
and it uses it ...
There is one known issue with some later version of X on radeons crashing
on PCI GART setups, benh was cooking a patch for X, it isn't something we
can fix in the kernel..
Dave.
