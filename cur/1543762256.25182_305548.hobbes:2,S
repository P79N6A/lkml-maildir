I have updated to Wilcox's rewrite, Rajesh's stuff, and Dely's latest
patch.  Still seeing these:
[root@intlhotp-1 4]# uname -a
Linux intlhotp-1 2.6.11andro #5 SMP Wed Mar 23 12:00:56 PST 2005 x86_64
x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
[root@intlhotp-1 ~]# modprobe acpiphp
acpiphp: ACPI Hot Plug PCI Controller Driver version: 0.5
acpiphp: Slot [4] registered
acpiphp: Slot [3] registered
[root@intlhotp-1 ~]# cd /sys/bus/pci/slots/4
[root@intlhotp-1 4]# echo 0 > power
This *does* take this slot off line.  Before, I see in lscpi
08:00.0 Ethernet controller: Intel Corp.: Unknown device 105f (rev 03)
08:00.1 Ethernet controller: Intel Corp.: Unknown device 105f (rev 03)
After, these are gone.
[root@intlhotp-1 4]# cat power
1
Hrm, this should be 0.
[root@intlhotp-1 4]# echo 1 > power
acpiphp_glue: No new device found
There is a card plugged into that slot.
Here is some info from the BIOS:

Any ideas?
