Userspace now knows, that stradis can take control of this hardware, so US loads
it, because MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE is present in the driver (you may compare old
and new /lib/modules/`uname -r`/modules.pcimap). It shows us the next way, how
to solve this -- delete this TABLE line from the driver, to not advertise "I can
take control of it".

Unfortunately not.

It is the best short-term solution, I think.
So, what to do now, Mauro, Nathan? Fix it in US (i.e. blacklist) or KS (i.e.
delete TABLE entry -- hope this helps) for the time until the driver will be
integrated?
