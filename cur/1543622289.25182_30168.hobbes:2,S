Yes.  And sane 1.0.5.  FWIW, the command I'm using that stutters
with uhci and not usb-uhci is:
scanimage --mode lineart --resolution 600 -x 203.2 -y 271.0 \
	--contrast 0 --brightness 0  > /tmp/copy.pbm
That results in a 3848837 byte file in about 37 seconds with
usb-uhci.  Not exactly pushing the USB 1.1 bandwidth.  (unless
there's a significant discrepancy between the bits coming from the
scanner and those scanimage dumps to the file, I suppose)
(Incidentally, I still haven't worked out how to get it to properly
autoload the scanner driver at startup.  It loads the USB printer
driver fine, but not the scanner, which I have to manually modprobe
myself.  I've started fiddling with post-install scripts with
sleeps, but haven't worked out the magic yet.)
