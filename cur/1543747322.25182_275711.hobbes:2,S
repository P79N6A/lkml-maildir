How about this formulation then:
- move anything that is not protected by #ifdef __KERNEL__ to the
ukabi header tree, adding an include in the beginning of the original
header that includes the ukabi header.  Since ukabi stuff can't depend on
kernel-internal stuff, having this include as the first thing in the
existing header should work.
- figure out what should have been protected by #ifdef __KERNEL__ but
wasn't, and move it back
- wait for bug reports from the world and deal with them
- repeat until you feel you got it right

The specific problem we're trying to address is the creation of header
files that define the ABI between userland and kernel, that both
kernel and userland can use.

David, Linus is right.  Using standard types is not an option because
they're not built in type names; you have to include a header to bring
them in, and ideally you shouldn't gratuitously get the names defined
just because you include some unrelated header, although the C
Standard grants standard headers freedom to include other headers or
something along these lines; I don't recall the exact passage of the
Standard that says so, but we should strive to not pollute the user
namespace anyway.
