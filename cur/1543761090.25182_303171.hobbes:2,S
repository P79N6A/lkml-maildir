Yes, the locks do want to live inside the buffer_head.
Stephen has pointed out that we might want to remove
jbd_lock_bh_journal_head() altogether some time, just use
jbd_lock_bh_state() for that.
In 2.4 these locks are global (or per-superblock).  Making them a global
spinlock would be acceptable for 2-ways and probably larger.
