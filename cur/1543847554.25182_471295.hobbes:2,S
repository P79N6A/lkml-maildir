My main motivation is that I'm assuming other uses of the interface will
exist. Then anything that uses the interface after postcore will avoid
switching clocks later.
If I for instance, just return clocksource_jiffies until the system is
fully booted then any thing that got a clock early, even during part of
device_initcall, would end up switching to a new clock when boot up
finished. I think that was acceptable when just timekeeping might have
been using the interface, but I don't know that it would scale well from
1 to 2 to 5 users of the interface. Then you would have several clock
switches happened after boot up .

The shuffling that you commented about in kernel/time/clocksource.c
which was the reason for the "finished_booting" flag, and related code.

This is something I've struggled with, but it's still and issue with the
current code to a lesser degree. Like cpufreq isn't likely to be used
during bootup, but acpi sleep states might be..
The current code can be classified as avoiding shuffle, but not
eliminating it. Like with the acpi_pm timer, I was thinking I'd just put
it back into device_initcall and assume shuffling might happen in rare
cases.
