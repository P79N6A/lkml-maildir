>Sure. Execute `swapoff -a`, followed by `swapon -a`. This is no joke.
Thanks. That really helped, let alone the fact that swapoff is a lengthy
operation (I can understand why), the resulting memory was even less than
the original RAM+swap size. I guess that happened because of memory
rearrangements when moving it up to RAM.
