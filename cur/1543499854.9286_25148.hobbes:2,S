I spent yesterday testing out my sg device driver with
Jaroslav's DMA page allocation patch. A discussion of
the tests and the results (with a section on memory 
issues) can be found at:
http://www.torque.net/sg/s_index.html
Basically it all went very well. However for my test
configuration the 2 MB chosen for the DMA page pool
size wasn't quite enough. So I think we need the kernel
parameters as suggested by Dan Hollis.
Also the implementation seems to give up when the
2 MB is exhausted without checking the main pool.
[Hopefully I'm wrong here].
This patch is obviously not architecturely independent
so we need to think how to handle this. For example,
the second page pool (for DMA) is only generated on 
architectures that need it.
