Qwest is taking forever with our T1 lines but once that problem is solved
we'll put up a version of the BK server on bkbits that will give you
either GNU style patches or tarballs of an exported tree.  Then *all*
projects mirrored on bkbits are automagically exported to good old plain 
text format.
And, because people might want to build their own gateways (we can only
hope) the diffs can be extracted with checkin comments as shown below.
That ought to be sufficient so that you can do whatever you want.  I'm
pretty sure that patch(1) will just ignore all the leading comments.
How's that?
