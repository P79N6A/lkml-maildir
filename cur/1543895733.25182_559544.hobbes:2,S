The keywords here are "learn" and "become aware": It's a process
which takes time, and which requires ongoing communication.
I argue that if you keep the free loaders out, you miss
the chance to communicate with and educate them.
Communication across borders doesn't work well, and you create
a border between the morally "good" and the "bad".
Of course you can't expect that every free loader will
learn and accept the free software philosopy, some just
won't. But to me that's acceptable, and the GPLv2, or indeed
Linus' tit-for-tat interpretation of the GPLv2, is IMHO
sufficient to protect my interests.

I'm not arguing about the GPL, especially not against the GPLv2.
What I'm concerned about is that the language you use trying to
promote the GPLv3 is IMHO anti-promotion of free software.
I believe executives don't read licenses. What they'll read is
the random article about "GPLv3 to outlaw tivoization",
"FSF wants to keep free loaders away" etc.
What is more likely, that they'll go to www.gnu.org to read
and absorb the GNU philosopy in order to become an accepted
member of the free software community, or that they'll decide to
stick with their proprietary RTOS then?
