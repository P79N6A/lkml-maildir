No, more likely your friend made a mistake.
Conjectured scenario: use *fdisk to shrink windows partition
to make room for Linux stuff. But fdisk does not touch the inside
of a partition, and the FAT filesystem in there still has the same
size as always, and when it fills up it overwrites the start of
your Linux stuff.
This is a common mistake. One cannot resize a filesystem
(FAT, ext2 or any other type, not even a swap partition)
with fdisk.
