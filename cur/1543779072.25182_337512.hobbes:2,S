What you are dealing with is a machine that is using ITC as a time bases. 
That is a special case. The fix should not affect machines that have a 
proper time source. More below. You can circumvent the compensation for 
ITC inaccuracies by specifying "nojitter" on the kernel command if you are 
willing to take the risk of slightly inaccurate time.

Well get a proper time source and do not use ITC for a time source in an 
SMP system. Got HPET hardware?

This is going to cause unnecessary overhead for non ITC users.

Here it is.

and here again.

Two read_seqretries() for one  read_seqbegin()? That its unusual to say 
the least.
