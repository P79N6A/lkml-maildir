Yes, this patch fixes the problem.
I've submitted a different patch based on the testing results (Email
subject: [PATCH] ohci_hcd: ALi USB M5237 host controller init quirk),
which enables the quirk for my USB controller. That hopefully will
save you some work.
The lspci -n output (for reference) is:
0000:00:02.0 Class 0c03: 10b9:5237 (rev 03)
Which equals:
PCI_VENDOR_ID_AL / PCI_DEVICE_ID_AL_M5237
Thanks,
