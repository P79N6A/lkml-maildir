Con, given the problems reported, maybe each of these should be in a
different changeset (OXXint, etc...).
Seeing the large number of changes, compared to previous releases gave me a
pause on this patch.  So I waited a few minutes and there was a problem
report quickly.
Is there any way you can provide each change in a seperate patch, so we can
narrow down the problem patch? (I have a feeling that most of your changes will do a
lot of good)
