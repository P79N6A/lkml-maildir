I just wanted to emphasis that _all_ units should be milli oder centi. 
Not mixing centiDegrees and milliVolts or one driver using milliVolt and 
another centiVolt.
 From your description it could well be, that one driver uses centi's 
and another milli's, both for voltage or one driver uses milliVolt but 
centi-degree.
Thanks,
