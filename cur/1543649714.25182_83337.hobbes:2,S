And that's exactly what I wanted to know, thanks.
Out of curiousity, how far back to you trust the code? 2.2? 2.0? I only
ask because a lot of the driver work I do is for underpowered
embedded targets running relatively ancient 2.0 kernels.

That's what I've been planning to do all along.   It will be nice not
having to convert 802.3<-->802.11 in every wireless driver.. plus the
added benefit of not having to realloc/memcpy buffers to work around
dumb DMA engines that require contiguious buffers..
