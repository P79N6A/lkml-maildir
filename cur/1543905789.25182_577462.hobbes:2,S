This is completely content-free anyway; the semantics of
#address-cells (and #size-cells, which you forgot) are
already defined in the base OF spec; what you _should_ be
defining here is a) the required value of #address-cells
for a rapidio bus; and b) how addresses on that bus are
represented (simply as a 64-bit integer, encoded as a
pair of 32-bit integers as usual; but it needs to be said).
