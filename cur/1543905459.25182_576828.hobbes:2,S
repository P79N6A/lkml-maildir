I think there's a big difference in philosophy between "break binary
drivers if you want to make a legitimate change for whatever reason" and
"break binary drivers just to be a pain in the ass to the developers and
users of said drivers."  I think most people here agree with the first.
It's unclear to me how many here agree with the second, but I know it's
at least one. ;-)
