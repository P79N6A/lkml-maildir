I just see this as an opportunity to make jfs more closely fit the
coding style of the mainline kernel.

I don't feel strongly one way or another about the use of boolean_t, but
under fs/, the only code that uses that type is in fs/jfs and fs/xfs,
which are both ported from other operating systems.  Using ints for
boolean values does seem to be the accepted practice in the kernel.

I could be persuaded to leave the declarations as boolean_t or even
making them bool, but right now I'm leaning toward making them int for
consistency.
