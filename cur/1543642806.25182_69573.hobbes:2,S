Looking at vmalloc implementation, it fills the page table mappings (pgd and 
pmd) of only init_mm. When other tasks access these pages their mappings are 
updated on demand by the page fault handler, right? Vfree, also, updates the 
entries of just init_mm and, of course, flushes the cache and the tlb. But 
what about other tasks that have acquired mappings to these pages?
