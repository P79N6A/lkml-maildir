I'd disagree with this - both are mechanisms for controlling the amount
of CPU time and memory that processes get to use. They have fundamentally
the same objective ... having 2 mechanisms to do the same thing with
different interfaces doesn't seem like a good plan. I don't think CKRM is 
anything like as far away from being ready as you seem to be implying -
we're talking about a month or two, I think.
