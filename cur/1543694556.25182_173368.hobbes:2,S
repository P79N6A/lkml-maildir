This code was conceived before my time and I don't recall seeing much
discussion, so this is all guesswork..
I'd say that the high_memory test _is_ superfluous and that if anyone
cared, we would remove it and establish a temporary pte against the address if
it was outside the direct-mapped area.  But nobody cares enough to have
done anything about it.

I don't know, and I suspect it depends on the off-CPU hardware
implementation anyway.  But the access will either generate a fault or it
won't and in either case we're OK, yes?

ick.  That would be very poor form.  What about things like probing for
memory, device hot-unplug, memory hot unplug etc?
Still, the code you have is quite reasonable.  But please structure it
thusly:
#include <asm/io.h>	/* valid_phys_addr_range */
#ifndef ARCH_HAS_VALID_PHYS_ADDR_RANGE
static inline int valid_phys_addr_range(unsigned long addr, size_t *count)
{
	unsigned long end_mem;
	end_mem = __pa(high_memory);
	if (addr >= end_mem)
		return 0;
	if (*count > end_mem - addr)
		*count = end_mem - addr;
	return 1;
}
#endif
or whatever.  It's a bit more conventional this way and allows other
architectures to do appropriate things.
As for return values: if the requested read or write starts at a
not-present address it should probably return -EFAULT.  This is what ia32
will do.  Arguably this is indistinguishable from a bad address on the
userspace side and we should return -EINVAL but whatever.
If the request starts at a valid phys address but covers a not-present
address it should return a short read or write (returns something less than
`count').
