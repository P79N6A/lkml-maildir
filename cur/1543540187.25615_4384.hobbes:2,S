Deabin DOING it. And I have NO complains about such behaviour. Read-only
mounts not such a big problem:

[skipped]
   Since /usr/local may be mounted read-only from a remote server, these
   directories have to be created and removed by the postinst and prerm
   maintainer scripts. These scripts must not fail if either of these
   operations fail. (In the future, it will be possible to tell dpkg not
   to unpack files matching certain patterns, so that the directories can
   be included in the .deb packages and system administrators who do not
   wish these directories in /usr/local do not need to have them.)
   For example, the emacs package will contain
              mkdir -p /usr/local/lib/emacs/site-lisp || true
   in the postinst script, and
              rmdir /usr/local/lib/emacs/site-lisp && \
              rmdir /usr/local/lib/emacs || \
              true
   in the prerm script.
   If you do create a directory in /usr/local for local additions to a
   package, you must ensure that settings in /usr/local take precedence
   over the equivalents in /usr.
   However, because '/usr/local' and its contents are for exclusive use
   of the local administrator, a package must not rely on the presence or
   absence of files or directories in '/usr/local' for normal operation.

It looks like MUCH better compromise then "do not play games with
/usr/local and let sysadmin make symlinks again and again (after each
upgrade)".
