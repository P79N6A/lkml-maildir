I think we should remove the argument to suspend() in the same patch
series. Yes, that would mean porting all drivers that currently use it,
but that's not actually all that many since most drivers are dumbed-down
wrt. power management.
And realistically, resume for thaw makes no sense, nor does suspend for
freeze, so we probably want to change those over to suspend/restart and
use them. or something.
