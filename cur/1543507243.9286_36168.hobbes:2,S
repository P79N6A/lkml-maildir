I have the same exact hard-drive, and the exact same problem.
Go into your bios and change the PIO mode for that hard-drive down to PIO
mode 2.  It can't take it any faster, even though it says it can do PIO4.
I had one in a 486 with no problems.  When I upgraded to a K6/via
motherboard, the on-board IDE tried to run the drive to fast.  Took me
forever to figure out what it was.  This also can cause filesystem
corruption so be careful.
I don't know if it is possible to blacklist this drive or what.  Setting
PIO mode using hdparm doesn't work, you have to do it in the BIOS.
