We seem to be having a problem with the definition of an SMA.  I'm
talking about all the kernel code like the following (and similar
stuff for guidinfo, nodedescription, portinfo, pkeytable).
You must have nearly identical code in your userspace SMA, since it
also has to respond to the same SM queries, right?
I'm trying to understand why you can't get down to one implementation
of these functions.
