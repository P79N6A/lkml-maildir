Subject: [patch 18/32] TOKENRING: Remote memory corruptor in ibmtr.c
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us know.

From: David Miller <davem@davemloft.net>
ip_summed changes last summer had missed that one.  As the result,
we have ip_summed interpreted as CHECKSUM_PARTIAL now.  IOW,
->csum is interpreted as offset of checksum in the packet.  net/core/*
will both read and modify the value as that offset, with obvious
reasons.  At the very least it's a remote memory corruptor.
