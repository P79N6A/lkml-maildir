I'm not a kernel guru, neither I can even try to understand how an
operating system's memory management is designed or behaves. But I've some
questions and thoughs:
1. Is swap=2xRAM a desing issue, or just a recommendation to get best
results _based_ on current VM subsystem status ?
2. Wouldn't performance drop quickly when VM starts to swap
processes/pages to disk, instead of keeping them on RAM ?. Maybe having a
couple of GB worth of processes on disk is not very wyse.
3. Shouldn't an ideal VM manage swap space as an extension of system's RAM
(of course, taking into account that RAM is much faster than HD, and
nothing should be on swap if there is room enough on RAM ?.
4. Wouldn't you say that "adding more swap" (maybe 2xRAM is a
recommendation, maybe a temporary fix, maybe a design decission) is the
M$-way of fixing things ?. If there is a _real_ need for more swap to get
a well baheving system, let's add swap. But we shouldn't hide inner desing
and/or implementation problems under the "cheap multigigabyte disks"
argument.
5. AFAIK, kernel developers are well aware of current 2.4.x problems in
some areas. I don't think insisting on certain problems without providing
ideas, testing, support, and limiting to just blaming the authors is the
best way to go. Maybe kernel hackers are the most interested of all in
fixing all these issues ASAP.
Just some thoughts from someone unable to write C code and help fix this
mess ;).
