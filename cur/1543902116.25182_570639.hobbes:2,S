Thank you for making sure of it.

My testing machine is ordinary dual core non numa box. So it might not
trigger the problem that you are warried about under heavy slab alloc
failure injection.
At first glance I couln't find the problem in cpu hottplug code in slab.c yet,
but found some memory leak path. (it doesn't break slab though)
