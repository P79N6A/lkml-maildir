That is much nicer, thanks.

I thought of something better to say than this.  Enabling a new
pseudo filesystem is interesting, but it's not the main point.
Now:
 config CGROUPS
        bool "Control Group support"
        help
-         This option will let you use process cgroup subsystems
-         such as Cpusets
+         Control Groups enable processes to be grouped into "cgroups"
+         to facilitate tracking and resource management. For example
+         a cgroup can tie a set of processes to a set of CPUs using
+         "cpusets".
-         Say N if unsure.
+         See <file:Documentation/cgroups.txt> for more information.
+
+         If you say Y here, you probably want to enable one or
+         more of the cgroup subsystem options below.
+
+         If unsure, say N.
Regarding GROUP_SCHED and CGROUP_SCHED I am confused, what is the
difference between these two options?
config GROUP_SCHED
        bool "Group CPU scheduler"
        default y
        help
          This feature enables the CPU scheduler to recognize task groups
          and control CPU bandwidth allocation to such task groups.
          See <file:Documentation/sched-design-CFS.txt> for more information.
[...]
config CGROUP_SCHED
        bool "Control groups"
        depends on CGROUPS
        help
          This option allows you to create arbitrary task groups
          using the "cgroup" pseudo filesystem and control
          the CPU bandwidth allocated to each such task group.
          See <file:Documentation/cgroups.txt> for more information
          on the "cgroup" pseudo filesystem.
Also with the titles, IMHO "Control Group support" is semantically
equivalent to "Control groups" so I am doubly confused.
Nick.
