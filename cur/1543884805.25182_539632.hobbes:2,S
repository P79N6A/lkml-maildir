I am not sure that solving it all in userspace is right solution.
Consider a sleep button. It can be hooked up via ACPI, located on AT
keyboard, USB keyboard or even on a remote control or some userspace
daemon getting data from the network. If kernel just passes raw data
to userspace then userspace programs need to know all these potential
sources and handle them separately. But with unified input device
interface userspace program only needs to monotor appearance of new
event devices, latch onto them and wait for EV_KEY/KEY_SLEEP. And it
is not much burden for the kernel because kernel already interfaces
with all these devices. In fact there probably savings because kernel
uses single interface layer.

I am afraid this statement is too vague, we need to discuss specific
scenarios...
Consider this scenario:
You use 2 PS/2 keyboards with your laptop - built-in and external one
on a separate serio port. Your built-in has media keys generating some
non-standard scancodes. The external one also has same media keys but
generating different set of keycodes. With unified input events you
can "fix" your keboards to generate same input events and the rest of
your stack does not care.
