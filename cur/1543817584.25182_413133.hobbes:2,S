Ok I can't see what I'm doing wrong.
here are my watermarks
idx = zone_idx(z);
ns->lowfree[idx] = z->pages_high * 3 + z->lowmem_reserve[idx];
ns->highfree[idx] = ns->lowfree[idx] + z->pages_high;
It's (3 * pages_high) +lowmem_reserve which is well in excess of the reserve 
so I can't see any problem. Am I missing something?
Cheers,
Con
