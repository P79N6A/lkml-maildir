I use a rule that filters all mail with the relevant charset specifier
in the HEADERS into a separate folder, and check that folder on an
infrequent basis - usually once a month or thereabouts.
I'm not at home atm, so can't be certain I've got this right, but I
*THINK* I use the following rule:
	:0
	* ^Sender: .*linux-kernel@vger.rutgers.edu
	{
		:0
		* [ISO-2922-JP]
		Linux/Kernel-Japanese
		:0
		Linux/Kernel
	}
Have a good look though, as I could easily have the wrong charset ID
there...
Best wishes from Riley.
