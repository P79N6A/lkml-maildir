Subject: Strange memory problem with Linux booted from U-Boot

Hi,
I need some help on solving this strange problem.
Here is what I have,
I have a loadable module (linux.2.4.20) which contains a 2 mb static gloabal
array.
When I load it from linux booted via U-Boot the system crashes.
Everything works ok if I do the same thing with the same linux booted with
RedBoot.
Before loading the module I check the current meminfo and get the same
result both times.
Additional information:
The same error occurs if I just run depmod -a.
system: Avila board 64 MB RAM, ixdp425 architecture, U-Boot: 1.1.2.
Linux is MontaVista(R) Linux(R) Professional Edition 3.1.
Ok, now an amazing reproduction of the same problem from user mode:
the code below works for val = (~0), but not for 0, or even (~ff).
Again, it works fine for linux booted from RedBoot.
Some glue or something where and what to look?
Any ideas of what potentially could cause this problem?
Please CC me on reply.
Thanks!
Ara
Several days ago I posted this question to U-boot mailing list but got not
much help there:)

Now the (user level) code:
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
const int pass = 64;
const int size = 2 * 1024 * 1024;
const int val = 0xffffff00;
int main()
{
    cout << "starting val == " << hex << val << endl;
    char *buf = new char[size];
    cout << "allocated memory of " << size << " bytes. buf == " << (int)buf
<< endl;
    for (int j = 0; j < pass; j++)
    {
        cout << "passing " << j << endl;
        for (int i = 0; i < size; i++)
        {
            buf[i] = val;
        }
        cout << "passed" << endl;
    }
    cout << "freeing" << endl;
    delete []buf;
    cout << "finished!" << endl;
    return 0;
}
