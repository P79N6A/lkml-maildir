No, it doesn't.  Because with strict commit accounting, you know that
every hugetlb page is accounted for.  So there is no backout path for
multiple instantiation race.  Thread that lost in the race will always
go back to retry in hugetlb_no_page().  And since reservation is also
accounted in a global variable, total hugetlb pool won't fall below
what was reserved plus what is in use.  Even if sys admin tries to
reduce hugetlb pool, kernel won't release any pages that are reserved.
