Yes. A user-mode pointer, passed via ioctl() is valid in the kernel
in the context of the user, i.e., during read() write() ioctl().
However, it is not valid if it is accessed by some other process or
an interrupt. In other words, you can't store it somewhere and
access it later in some other context.

Since you need to copy anyway, you could mmap() your kernel
data (impliment mmap in your driver). Then you mmap both
"files" the same way and copy to/from in user-mode.
