	request_queue_t *q = blk_get_queue(dev);
	generic_unplug_device(q);
And that would be it. This is already exported and I use it in a
stand-alone module. I actually tinkered with replacing the old tq_disk
task queue with something that allows unplugging of individual queues,
exactly for wait_on_buffer/page. Didn't show much of an improvement,
but then again I didn't have so many active disk sub systems that
running tq_disk would screw the plugging of other queues. But it might
be worthwile to bring up for 2.5.

Right, that was the problem I faced as well. But I don't see any harm in
using generic_unplug even though the task is currently queued in tq_disk.
queue_task does not re-add a it (see include/linux/tqueue.h).
