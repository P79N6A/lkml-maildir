Well, still sizeof(kmalloc structures) ~= 1.3% of the real
data. That's not *that* bad overhad.

That's about 6MB more data to save on 400MB. Remember, I'm not
perfectionist (:-), and saving 1% more data to disk does not sound
_that_ bad to me.
Plus it only happens on highmem machines. Highmem is ugly hack, and is
going to die really soon, with 32-bit machines. I'd say it is not
worth fixing.
...I should not tell you, but swsusp is broken-by-design on highmem
machines. If you have 32GB highmem machine, under load, you'll
definitely run out of lowmem trying to swsusp it. Actually, you'll run
out of memory even on severely overloaded 2GB highmem machine
(attempting to swsusp). Fortunately noone knows, and noone cares.
