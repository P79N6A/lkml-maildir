I hope this is the right ML to post, if not please enlighten me where to ask :-)
With 2.6.5 I started experiemnting with IPv6 and now most everything is working OK.
However I found tons of the following in kernel logs:
May 14 05:39:40 [kernel] ICMPv6 checksum failed [2001:0200:0000:1800:0000:0000:09c4:0002 > 2001:02f8:0040:0002:020e:0cff:fe07:898b]

Searching on google, for "ICMPv6 checksum failed" got me some mostly irrelevant results :-(
I also found some patches for 2.6.6 of the kind:

 ]
And looking on my 2.6.6 machine, there are just a few of these errors in the log.
Does this mean that they don't happen or they are just not logged (because of LIMIT_NETDEBUG )?
Anyway, are these errors of any concern at all? I have really no idea what they mean, just the word error seems bad to me :-|
I will provide any information (.config, lspci, etc.) if needed.
Kalin.
