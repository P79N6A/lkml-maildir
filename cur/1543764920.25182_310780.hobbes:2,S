That is exactly the intended effect.  If I'm at my work machine (where
I'm not an admin unfortunately) and I mount my home machine with sshfs
(because FUSE is installed fortunately :), then I bloody well don't
want the sysadmin or some automated script of his to go mucking under
the mountpoint.

I don't understand.  The userspace can't enforce the permissions.
That can only be done by the kernel.  The "default_permissions" option
tells the kernel to enforce permissions based on file mode.  If the
option is missing, then the kernel does not enforce those permissions.

Other users won't be able to read even the attributes, so I don't see
it as a problem.  It will be a special "no go" directory for anyone
except the mount owner.

Well the sanity check on the "server" side is always enforced.  You
can't "trick" sftp or ftp to not check permissions.  So checking on
the "client" side too (where the fuse daemon is running) makes no
sense, does it?

So this objection is now dealt with.  Is that a problem?
