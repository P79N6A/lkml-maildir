keventd *must* still be around.
And the code obviously isn't completely stable, and this debug
message has found something rather unpleasant.
I don't think we should run the init tasks when keventd may, or
may not be running.  Sure, the current code does, by happenstance,
all work correctly when keventd hasn't yet started running, and
when it's starting up.  But it's safer, saner and surer just
to crank the damn thing up before proceeding.

Heh. Tell that to wakeup_bdflush().
The all-singing fully-async + fully-sync + async with callback
patch was dropped, and until we can demonstrate that it
fixes a bug, it can stay dropped.  I think it _will_ fix
a bug, but the development of userspace hotplug infrastructure
hasn't reached the stage where the need for a kernel fix
has been proven.
I believe the right thing to do here is the RMK approach.
Here's a faintly tested patch.
