it's not a fair repersentation. Again.. this export was unkeepable due to the
API being nasty and having to be fixed anyway ;(.
One of the problems was that the c-p-a api has to be followed by a cache flush function call.
Sadly that does a TOTAL flush of the caches of all cpus in the system. As part of the -rc1
changes, it is now done only on the exact pages that need to be flushed (so you no longer
flush 12Mb of caches when you only needed to flush 4Kb), but to achieve that, it was no longer
an option to keep this as 2 separate function calls.
Add to this that some very fundemanteal bugs couldn't be fixed without the function underlying
cpa changing prototype and behavior, so the function had to go.

I understand where he's coming from; at the same time it's a very small change to virtualbox to fix this
and has been done already... in minutes. Frans should take that up with the virtual box support forum, I'm sure
they have the patch available there. (it's mostly removing workarounds for cpa bugs and then just calling set_memory_x / set_memory_nx).
