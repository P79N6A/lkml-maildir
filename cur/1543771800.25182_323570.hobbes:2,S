Trond,
After running for awhile with the mtime related changes that I made to
nfs_refresh_inode() on 4/8/05, I noticed that I would sometimes see
stale file data on an an NFS client if the file had been updated but
it's new filesize was the same as the old filesize. The clients were
seeing the correct mtime for the file, but the data was stale.
In my previous change for mtime in nfs_refresh_inode(), the inode was
being marked invalid, but the data was not. In the following patch, if
the mtime is updated and the data_unstable flag is not true, the inode
and the data will both be marked invalid. These changes solved the
original mtime issue as well as the stale data problem that I was
seeing.
Linda
The following patch is for 2.6.12-rc2:
