You mean rsync to the server and change files directly on the fs rather 
than through an NFS client?

Yeah, that's what happens... Clients that had the file open are liable 
to get ESTALE. Stale file handles stick around until unmount. As long as 
they're around automount will consider the mount busy and not expire it 
(but you can unmount manually or killall -USR1 automountd).
