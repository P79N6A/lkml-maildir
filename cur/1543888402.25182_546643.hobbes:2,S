Yeah, as I said already, if you're saying that all four of these warnings
are bogus and don't lead to any build failures, then perhaps the patch
I sent isn't any "critical" either. Again, I can't really confirm, because
I've never tried to build these drivers, because I don't have access to
powerpc / m68k machines.
But the patch I sent does suppress bogus warnings, and does it in a
way that is fairly common / similar to the way most other similar helper
stuff are handled in arch/.../config's.
Sam's patch will also suppress warnings, but the problem there is that
it kills off checking for "select"ion of non-existent symbols _completely_,
and thus may allow build breakages to occur.
