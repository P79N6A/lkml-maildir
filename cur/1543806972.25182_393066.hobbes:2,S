IMHO there is no need to userspace visible changes to support RS485 on these cards,
because some of them are RS485 only and some have jumpers for individual ports. 
There is nothing that userspace can configure. We only need to set two bits in ACR
according to card type and jumper settings and UART will drive RS485 transiever
transparently.
Actually any program which want to talk with RS485 network should implement some
form of line discipline itself to prevent network collisions and kernel cannot
help with it much.

For RS232 cace I agree, but for RS485 this is not needed IMHO.
