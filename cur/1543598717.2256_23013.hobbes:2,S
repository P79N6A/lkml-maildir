Everyone,
	Just a note: the VMA sanity patch which went in to 2.4.9
has improved Mozilla's performance considerably. I did a rough
calculation based on startup time and found that Mozilla started
approximately 10%-12% faster on 2.4.9 then 2.4.8. Plus, I've
found that swapping is actually starting to work again, although
it still tends to stick at certain times.
	Great job everyone.
Brad
