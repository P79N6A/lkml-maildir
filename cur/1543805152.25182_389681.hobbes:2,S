I'll leave it to Ingo to decide.  After all, the NOPed versions are in the
tree already and have been for some time.  They just are under the wrong
#ifdef, so it seems like it was his intent to provide it, but failed to
do so in a way that actually enabled them.
(and '_raw'  is a perfect prefix for the core spinlock services).
