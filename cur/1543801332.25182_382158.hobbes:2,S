Too much work to merge imho.

Afaiks it does not apply to the rt2x00 drivers. However these are still
strongly different from the ideal in-kernel driver. CodingStyle (arguable)
and locking - broken - would need more work. This is not yet another
80211 subsystem but it is not clear if the authors/maintainers plan to
merge their stuff in a near future.
