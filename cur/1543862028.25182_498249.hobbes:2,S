nommu kernels should probably run reclaim for higher-order allocations as
well.
That's rather a blunt instrument.  The "lumpy reclaim" patches in -mm
provide a much better approach, but they need more work yet (although I
don't immediately recall what's needed).
In the interim you could do the old "echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches"
thing, but that's terribly crude - drop_caches is really only for debugging
and benchmarking.
