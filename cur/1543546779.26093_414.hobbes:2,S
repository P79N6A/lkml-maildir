This patch along with a lot of other fixes are in the linuxppc
bitkeeper tree and in my rsync kernel tree at
linuxcare.com.au::linux-pmac-devel.  I sent Linus a patch against
test7-pre4 to update the ppc stuff but it appears to have suffered
from Linus' lossy mailbox.  Cort Dougan is I believe about to send
another PPC update to Linus.
Paul.
