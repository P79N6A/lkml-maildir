Then the md5 will fail and you will kindly advise the user that a dump is
not possible (or warn them it is extremely unwise).
Of course, we could spend the rest of the year making up excuses about
situations where dumping can't work. Do you really want to do that, or do
you want to examine the cases where dumping can work?

If the hardware is completely locked up (eg some card has the bus locked),
this will not be possible. That's why any disk writing should not be done
immediately on an OOPS while still in a kernel -- because you cannot be
sure at that point what state the hardware is in.
At least after a hardware reset (red button reset), you would be
reasonably sure (more sure than you would be when dumping at OOPS time) 
that the hardware is in a state where it can be initialized and a proper
dump can be done.

Here is my scenario:
- PC locks up, HARD, due to interaction between PCI cards and buggy
  drivers. no oops is possible since the harware is locked up.
- Press PC "red reset button" for hardware reset.
- PC enters minimal dump code using '286 return to real mode' trick.
- dump code would verify md5 of itself. if md5 is not valid, it asks
  user if they really want to try continue dumping but warns them that
  it might corrupt data. on the other hand if md5 is valid, it
  initializes hardware minimally if needed, and loads lilo.
- lilo dumps memory to swap paritition, then completely reboots the PC.
- lilo loads linux.
- 'swapon' sees a memory dump in the swap, and writes that to
  /var/crash/crashdump-bla-bla (of course, this dir and all files are
  mode 600 and owned by root).
