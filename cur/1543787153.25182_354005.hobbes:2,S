But you are speaking about printer/scanner/... or other external
devices, isn't it ?
Do you think they should be included in the automatic detection ? Or
would it be safer to let the user make the configuration by himself ?
As you pointed it out, it requires special rights and might actually be
dangerous. I'm not sure that this is worthing to try.
My view of this "autoconfig" was more to detect what is present in the
box, not what is lying outside...
