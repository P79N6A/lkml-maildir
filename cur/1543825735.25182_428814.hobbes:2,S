hm, indeed. misrouted_irq() goes through all irq descriptors and ignores 
IRQ_DISABLED flag - rendering disable_irq() useless in essence, and 
introducing the kind of deadlocks that lockdep warned about.
Andrew, as far as i can see with irqfixup this isnt a lockdep false 
positive but a real deadlock scenario - a spurious IRQ might arrive 
during vortex_timer() execution and might cause the execution of 
misrouted_irq(), which could execute vortex_interrupt() => deadlock.
Alan, is this a necessary property of irqpoll/irqfixup? Shouldnt 
irqfixup leave irq descriptors alone that are disabled?
