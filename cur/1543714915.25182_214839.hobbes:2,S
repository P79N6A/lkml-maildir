Hi all.
Here are two patches, that should be applied in
/usr/src/linux/drivers/input.  These make a config option, that if
selected, allows atd keyboards to beep rather than cluttering the screen
with  messages about too many keys pressed.   This has been patched
against the latest kernel tree from bitkeeper.--- atkbd.orig	2004-04-18 21:31:22.000000000 -0400
