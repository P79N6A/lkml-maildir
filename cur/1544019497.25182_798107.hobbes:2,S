Unfortunately people really seem to want the finer granularity that MODVERSIONS (sometimes) provides :(  I've tried killing it off several times, and always failed.
We did discuss changing modversions not to descend more than one level deep into types (ie. MODVERSION(int fn(struct foo *)) would depend on the type of struct foo, but not the type of any struct pointers in struct foo) to reduce the problem where header changes cause type definitions to be exposed or hidden and thus change the modversion.
I asked someone to do some analysis on what effect this would have on signatures in real releases, but never heard back (it was in Austin last year, and there was beer...)
Cheers,
Rusty.
