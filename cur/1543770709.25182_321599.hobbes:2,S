I strongly support this. It makes a big difference, not only from 
the technical point of view (as described above: developers have 
to master "two worlds"), but more importantly from the way
management sees things: As soon as some nanokernel or RT plus non-RT 
OS approach is mentioned, mgmt fears that there are two different 
sources of support (with the usual finger-pointing problems: "Not
our problem, report it to ..."), twice the patches and version 
hassles, additional legal issues and runtime license costs/troubles, 
two different development environments which must be supported 
by the central IT department, ...
When I was told to analyze whether linux is suitable for our
needs, any nanokernel or two-OS approaches were excluded from the
beginning: Mgmt thought that due to their nature and complexity,
such approaches are not able to offer any improvements w.r.t. what 
we have now. Clearly, "one system and one source" is wanted!
(we currently use a monolitic, "one-world" OS, but a commercial one)
