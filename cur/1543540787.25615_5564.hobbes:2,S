	Hello all,
		I have investigated these things through other
	channels before posting here. I am not a subscriber to
	the mailing list, so if anyone could help, a personal reply
	would be much, much appreciated.
	First, passing AF_UNSPEC on a re-connect of a UDP socket
	will not "disconnect" it, as is the standard behavior.
	What was the reasoning behind the decision for this? Is
	it a feature waiting to be added? Is there a patch somewhere?
	Secondly, BSD style kernels have a dev filesystem entry for
	tunnel devices, but it appears that Linux does not. How does
	Linux deal with tunnel devices as opposed to a BSD kernel? Is
	there a patch to allow access to the tunnel device from the
	filesystem? Again, what was the design rationale behind this?
	Thanks in advance for any info!
	rt
