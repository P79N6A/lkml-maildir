Hi Nigel,
I do agree with all your plans ;)
I'm also happy with the current version of tuxonice.
The main question is :
"What is the status of merging into mainline" (with or without any 
additional patch from other suspend patch).
I have seen quite a lot of mails about this topic on the lmkl in 2007... ;)
