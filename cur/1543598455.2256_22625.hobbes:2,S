It does :)
Thank you for adding to this thread.  I want your opinion: as the author
of /dev/random, its your turf.  What do you think of the patch?  It has
been posted for various kernel versions, the newest patches are at
http://tech9.net/rml/linux
Obviously there is a theoretical risk, that is why it is configurable.
Is the need or the practical risk sufficient that the patch is useful?
I have gotten a lot of positive feedback.
If the patch were to be merged into the kernel, would you like anything
changed?  Would a /proc interface be useful (this would add overhead,
right now there is zero extra code after compile)?  What about changing
the entropy estimate to reflect the possible less entropy from net
devices?
Personally, I like the patch as is, but these have been issues raised.
