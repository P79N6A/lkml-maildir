was some exported directory quite big? Try running a "find /mnt/..." on
the client to see when exactly it fails. I observe similar behavior
when reading huge directories of some 1000 entries. What nfs version
are you using? You may try "mount -o nfsvers=2 ..." or 3.
My own Oops seems to be reproducible when using a Sun (2.8) as
client, only. It did not occur when using nfsV2. I also failed
to reproduce the bug when mounting by an other Linux client.
So may be we observe two different bugs here.
With that instability observed, I won't/can't switch to 2.6.x for
my system in production :-( Can I help somehow? Making a TCP-dump?
Try some patches?
Dieter.
