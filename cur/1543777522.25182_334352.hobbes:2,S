Also GITtable, as soon as the mirrors' work is done:
http://www.kernel.org/git/?p=linux/kernel/git/smurf/v2.6.13-rc3-mm1.git;a=summary
... since people asked:
- trees from GIT are properly parent-linked.
- yes, I can import other people's patch series.
- the whole import runs in a couple of minutes.
  In fact, I keep suspecting that it must be skipping some important
  step or other. ;-)  Kudos to Linus, and of course everybody else who's
  involved with git, for yet another tool done *right*.
