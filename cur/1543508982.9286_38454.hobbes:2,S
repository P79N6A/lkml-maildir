As this discussion continues, the more I think that PCI drivers need a
SIMPLE probe interface, more like my original patch, which just scans
for a list of PCI ids, and calls a callback for each successful id
match.  Most PCI drivers I've seen don't need to worry about subsystem
ids, for example, and only driver I've seen needed to worry about
chipset revision _at probe time_.  The PCI code already takes care of
the latency problem that Alan mentioned, in response to my original
patch.
Maybe I will whip up a pci_simple helper function interface, while the
wheels turn about a more complete solution like pci-scan.  For example
in a simple driver there is no need for a pci_id_info struct _and_ a
drv_id_info struct.
This simple interface would also be useful for the somewhat-common case
of a driver which must do a standard PCI probe (duplicating code), and
then something hairy and device-specific to the PCI registers.  The VIA
IDE timings driver I am hacking on is an example of this.

How does a driver define an arbitrary probe order under your scheme? 
Forcing a driver to depend on the order of the values returned from a
pci_find_class() iteration is not always desireable.

Keyword:  verbatim.  A driver using my PCI helper patch should be able
to recompile under 2.2.x or 2.0.x without changes.  Only the helper
implementation would change.  Although, my structure definitely needs a
'name' member, as older pci_dev structs did not have such a member.

My point was that pci-scan.c might have to change in order to be useful
to a complex driver using its API.  In that respect pci-scan.c would not
be a drop-in replacement for some of my current PCI probing code which
gets duplicated across drivers.

Make pci-scan useful (to me) means:
o don't printk if the PCI device I/O or mem region decoding is not
enabled
o allowing arbitrary probe order
o using void pointers to pass data to callbacks, allowing a driver to
avoid using globals
o supporting multiple base addresses
o using the new members in pci_dev instead of re-reading register values
o resource code hooks for MMIO regions, not just I/O addresses
o limiting the number of devices probed/registered to N
And small nit while I was looking at pci-scan:  You need to use
IORESOURCE_IO not PCI_BASE_ADDRESS_SPACE_IO when testing the flags
member of 'struct resource' if I'm not mistaken.

Your code seems more complex than necessary for many drivers, which
often only do a simple PCI id check.
Your code seems inadequate for cases needing any of the features listed
above.  For this case, generic code can be written to do the job, while
not needlessly duplicating code all over the kernel.
Making your code more generic decreases overall kernel code size, IMHO,
by reducing needless duplication of complex case handling.

The resource allocation code makes my multi-channel framegrabber driver
much simpler.  A driver which needs implement malloc()-style
functionality for its on-board memory can now rely on generic code to
make its task much easier.  Finding suitable space for a new channel
buffer becomes very easy.  Video drivers can similarly benefit from the
new resource code, as their framebuffer memory has multitudes of uses
too.

If it makes my code smaller and more simple, I care.
