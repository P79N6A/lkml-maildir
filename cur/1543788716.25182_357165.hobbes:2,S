Hello Everyone ,
All books that I have read say that the concept of ZONE_HIGHMEM is
introduced because some architectures cannot directly map memory
beyond 896MB (x86).
My question is What is direct mapping(does it mean, same virtual
address and physical address) and why cant a architecture directly map
a particular region in the memory?
