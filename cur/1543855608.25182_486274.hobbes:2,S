hm, this means the lock was taken twice by the same task: enabling 
CONFIG_PROVE_LOCKING ought to tell us the precise locking info and 
backtraces that causes this situation. I looked at the code and it wasnt 
obvious at first sight. (we should only be holding cache_chain_mutex 
here, and l3->list_lock should not be taken at this point.)
