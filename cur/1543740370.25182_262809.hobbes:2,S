with DVI output:
29 Euro
without DVI output:
< 10 Euro (current Ebay prices including shipping for a Matrox G200 
           which is a really good 2D card)

3D is a nice feature, but I wouldn't pay extra money for it

1. stability
2. no fan
3. price

I do not care that much about 3D performance.
My graphics card has a ATI Radeon 7000 and offers as output
VGA, DVI and VideoCinch. The card has no fan.
This card is more than enough for all my uses (I use DVI, but not 
VideoCinch; even Tuxracer runs fine although I wouldn't need the 3D 
suppport).
This card is well-supported with open source drivers (and I'm using 
only open source drivers).
I didn't experience any problems with it.
This card which is more than enough for all of my uses is sold in it's 
32 MB version for 29 Euro [1] in many shops.

[1] that's not a special offer, this price is stable for at about half a
    year now
