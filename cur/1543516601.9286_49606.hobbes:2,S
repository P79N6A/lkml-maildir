I did some testing on my laptop with linux 2.2.13.
So far as I can tell my HD on the laptop is running in DMA mode.
Additionally, the 'hdparm -u 1 /dev/hda' had no effect on the overrun
problem.
It acted pretty much as Jim has described.  With the FIFO level mod,
Nearly 100% failure at 115200, 10% failure at 57600.
At 115200 it always fails, so far as I can tell, right away.  Long
before any data is actually written to disk.
One of the "other" drivers must be holding of the serial interrupt
for too long.
