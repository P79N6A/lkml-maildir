Oh?
Anyway, we'll get nice warnings about wrong type of argument when that
happens.
I was the one who found the fops_get/put code useful as a guideline
and also in fact as the code to call.
So the question is: What is the defined interface for fops_get/put: Is
it "it's a macro that... " or is it "it's a function (possibly a macro
for efficiency) that.... "?

P.S. Apologies for Patrick's bad quoting habits: He had to catch a
