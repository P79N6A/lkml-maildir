In 2.6.20-rc2, fs/proc/proc_misc.c has been changed to need include/linux/compile.h. As the latter
file contains the dat and time of the compilation, this change ensures that the kernel will be
relinked with every make call, even if it is run just after a successful make run.
In my work as the bcm43xx maintainer, I make frequent trial changes to that module. It seems a waste
to have to relink the kernel with every such change.
