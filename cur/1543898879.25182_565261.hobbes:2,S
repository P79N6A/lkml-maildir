Yes, the large if() is redundant in this particular patch.
But in further patches, the switch() is enclosed inside a 
spin_lock_irqsave() and list_for_each_entry(target_list) and so the
large if() upfront saves us from unnecessarily disabling interrupts
and iterating through the entire target_list in the case that it is
a notification for an event that we don't care about.
So I'll remove this if() from this patch and introduce it in the
later one itself, which is where it starts making some sense, anyway.
