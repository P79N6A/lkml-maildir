I use Lilo way as following:
append initrd=ramdisk.img root=/dev/ram0 rootfs=tmpfs vga=791
The "vga=normal" acts like no framebuffer (same problem). If I don't use the
framebuffer, I don't pass vga=791.
I don't see any boot ptompt and I watch the little led on cdrom. It doen't seem
to load anything. When I push the cd eject button, the cd comes out. Usually
when it loads, it doesn't come out by pushing the button.
