Off topic sorry, can't resist.
Maybe so Lee, but first we'ed better check with the USTPO, as one of 
the major table saw makers is actually selling a saw that you can 
stick a weiner into while its running, and a common bandaid can cover 
the damage.  The blade is stopped before the next tooth after the one 
that initially contacts the weiner can come around and do more than 
scratch the weiner.  The stop is a bit noisy I assume considering you 
are stopping a blade turning 3k to 6k rpms in 1/4" of linear motion 
at the rim of the blade, and rather expensive, ISTR a $400 option in 
their top of the line 10 inch table saws.  Because of the larger 
components, the 14" saw carries over $1k premium for that option.
