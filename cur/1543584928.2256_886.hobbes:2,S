Subject: 2.4.2-ac20 gets in infinite loop during bootup

According to SysRq-P, my system gets in an infinite loop on bootup with
notifier_call_chain calling irda_device_event repeatedly.
This is triggered by toshoboe_open calling register_netdevice.
This is with everything irda-related built-in (I don't like modules); it was
working in 2.4.1-ac8.
Is it possible that the irda_device_event notifier is added twice somewhere?
It appears to me this would result in the observed loop, as if the irda
(priority=0) is on the end of the list and the same notifier is added,
it will position itself at the end of the list again and set it's own 'next'
to a pointer to itself (twice), if I read it correctly.
David.
