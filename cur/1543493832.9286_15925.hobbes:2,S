   However, why not go all the way up to the limits permitted by rfc
   2414 (
ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2414.txt
)?
The networking maintainers are more than aware of this RFC, we just
don't feel comfortable (yet) with using a default larger than we
currently use.
I considered making it a sysctl, but my interests of getting a correct
and working fix out for the broken stacks out there overrode this
idea.
