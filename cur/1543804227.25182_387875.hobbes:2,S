If you think it's appropriate to implement a new filesystem to replace a
single ioctl that returns two integers, we can probably do that, but
more realistically, the GETPORT ioctl can probably live a long and
untroubled life as another netlink message.

The most important chunk of likely common code I can see at the moment
is the stuff for bodging user page mappings that we got hammered over
already.  The drivers/infiniband/ tree already has code that does
something like this, and a few other not-yet-in-tree network drivers
that support RDMA have similar needs, too.
