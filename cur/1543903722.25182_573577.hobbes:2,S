That's right. The kernel package should not be dependent on kexec-tools
package (including makedumpfile). I understand Dan Aloni's proposal
(including the dump filtering information in kernel) makes many
advantages. Ok, I agree with his proposal.
BTW, we should test makedumpfile by each linux(-rc1 ?) releases.
Now, I test the makedumpfile functions by comparing the crash utility's
output of /proc/vmcore and the one of the filtered dumpfile.
Often, the crash utility cannot read /proc/vmcore of the latest kernel.
Does anybody know the crash's option that the crash can run loosely for
the early test ?

That sounds good.
Dan Aloni, I'd like to cooperate with you for implementing this feature.
If you have some patches other than 2007/07/10 patches, could you send
me them ?  I will update them.
Thanks
