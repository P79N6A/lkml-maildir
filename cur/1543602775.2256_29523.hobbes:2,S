The biggest problem is to prevent the TCP server hogging all the
threads when a client gets congested.
With the UDP code, we use non-blocking I/O and simply drop all replies
that don't get through. For TCP dropping replies is not acceptable as
the client will only resend requests every ~60seconds. Currently, the
code therefore uses blocking I/O something which means that if the
socket blocks, you run out of free nfsd threads...
There are 2 possible strategies:
  1 Allocate 1 thread per TCP connection
  2 Use non-blocking I/O, but allow TCP connections to defer sending
    the reply until the socket is available (and allow the thread to
    service other requests while the socket is busy).
I started work on (2) last autumn, but I haven't had time to get much
done since then. It's on my list of priorities for 2.5.x though, so if
nobody else wants to get their hands dirty I will get back to it...
Cheers,
   Trond
