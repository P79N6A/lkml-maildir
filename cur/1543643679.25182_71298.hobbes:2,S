Martin ... Thanks for pointing it out.
The -38% degradation was seen on Sync Random Disk Writes, Sync
Sequential Disk Writes, and Sync Disk Copies observed from the
AIM9 bencmark running in Single User test mode. The degradation
is still there and I will investigate it later when we have the
hardware resource back.
Thanks ... Duc.

What happened to the -38% degradation you found? That seems to have
fallen off the results list for some reason ... did you fix it, or is it
still there?
