You responded to the wrong person, however I'll take this opportunity to 
agree with you, on the basis of my years of experience with critical path 
scheduling.  For project schedules 'earlist completion' is the name of the 
game, within bounds of available resources.  When you delay an indvidual 
'task' (I'm using the project management term here) past the earliest time it 
can be scheduled, you are using up its 'float', and if the delay is longer 
than the task's float, the completion time of the schedule as a whole will be 
delayed.  This is no different for a computer than it is for a group of 
people, it is still a scheduling problem.  Delaying any random task risks 
delaying the schedule as a whole, and that risk approaches certainty as the 
number of delays approaches infinity.
N.B.: the above observation is aimed at project managers, who will know 
exactly what I'm talking about.  Otherwise, don't worry if it sounds like so 
much BS, it actually isn't ;-)
