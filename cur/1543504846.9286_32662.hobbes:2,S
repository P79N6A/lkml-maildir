You could iterate through all the initializers to be run at boot time
until all of them have either have returned success or you don't make
progress anymore during one iteration in which case you have
uninitializable modules.
In this model the initialization of the ISA networking drivers mentioned
by Alan would be done by one software module which itself initializes all
the other modules.
