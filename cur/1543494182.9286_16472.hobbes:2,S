I fixed the bug. I forgot one of my lru_refile_unmapped_cache() in
unuse_pte ;). So when delete_from_swap_cache() was running, it was doing a
list_del(page->lru) it had page->lru pointing to the old ->lru
not-valid-anymore values...
Since I was in swapfile.c I also implemented a smarter cluster logic for
the swap allocation.
Now everything seems rock solid also after a swapoff -a.
So I would ask if you could try out 2.2.7_andrea2.bz2 and see if it's
responsive as 2.2.6_andrea2. I think it should be equally repsonsive but
quite faster. Let me know. And thanks for the great feedback!! ;))
