I have not seen that particular problem any more, so I think the patch 
helped.
I have found a new problem though:
# cat latency_trace
preemption latency trace v1.0
-----------------------------
  latency: 1883455195 us, entries: 1 (1)
  process: ksoftirqd/1/5, uid: 0
  nice: -10, policy: 0, rt_priority: 0
=======>
  0.000ms (+0.000ms): cond_resched_softirq (___do_softirq)
That looks bad to me. The user did not notice any latency, but 1883 
seconds seems like a high latency to me!
