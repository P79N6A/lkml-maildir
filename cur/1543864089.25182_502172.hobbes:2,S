You're forgetting the large, unknown number of places in the kernel which
are presently buggy in the presence of CPU hotplug.  With your proposal, we
still need to hunt them all down and put magic locks around them, and we need to
continue to do that as the kernel evolves.
If we use the process freezer, these bugs all get automatically fixed, and we get
to remove the existing locking, and we don't need to think about it any
more.

Who said it's complete rewrite?  Nobody's even started to look at it afaik.
It might be quite simple.
