This won't work. The trouble we have is that a partition detection can be
done in two completely different situations. First the "normal" detection
with a builtin dasd driver. ibm_partition is called with no locks held and
with a non-open block device. Second the detection can be done as part of
a block device open with an automated module load. In this case the
get_blkfops functions requests the module which in turn calls the partition
detection. That is done with the bd_sem semaphore of the block device held.
The call to ioctl_by_bdev with the builtin dasd driver fails because the
block device is not open. So we would need to add an open to the partition
detection but we can't do that because then the automated module load
would dead-lock.
Your hack to get it running only works by chance. The first ioctl_by_bdev
that is supposed to get the block number of the label block will fail as
well. So normally you'll end up loading the wrong block. The hack we are
currently using looks like this:

 }
The idea is to get ioctl_by_bdev to work for non-open devices. But it is
a hack because I do not safe-guard against module unloading.
