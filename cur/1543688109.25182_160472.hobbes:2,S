I'm no kernel developer so take my opinion as worth more than
anyone else here (much less).  The new scheduler in the 2.6
kernels is still being tweaked by Con and Igno, et al.  But beyond
that there are several new ways to tweak the scheduler
designed to handled different loads, amounts of mem. etc...
Skimming the past few months of the mail list archives for
what to tweak and how may enhance the tasks you are currently
testing.  My $0.01 (I'm cheap like that).
