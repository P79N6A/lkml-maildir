No, the "result" needs to go somewhere else. The caller may be totally 
uninterested in keeping the system call number or parameters around until 
the operation completes, but if you put them in the same structure with 
the result, you obviously cannot sanely get rid of them.
I also don't much like read-write interfaces (which the above would be: 
the kernel would read most of the structure, and then write one member of 
the structure). 
It's entirely possible, for example, that the operation we submit is some 
legacy "aio_read()", which has soem other structure layout than the new 
one (but one field will be the result code).
