Yes, but that will only apply to files that I specifically shred.  I
hazard that a lot more files than the ones I explicitly "rm" in a day
get deleted by other means.  Also, the shred man page even says that
it doesn't know if its "shredding" even happens in the same spot on
disk as the original data resided.  It seems this has to happen down
in the file system if there is any hope of it working.  And even there
it could use come help from the disk drive to make sure things can be
made to happen where they appear to happen.
