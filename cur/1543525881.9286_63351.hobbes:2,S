What's happening???
Almost exactly the change you propose has been put in
drivers/scsi/hosts.h in 2.3.45 . Works for me.

2.3.45 refused to compile for me today; the error was:
  sg.c: In function `sg_init':
  sg.c:1092: `CONFIG_SR_EXTRA_DEVS' undeclared (first use in this function)
A quick dig in the source turns up this bit of business 
(drivers/scsi/hosts.h):
#define SD_EXTRA_DEVS CONFIG_SD_EXTRA_DEVS
#define ST_EXTRA_DEVS CONFIG_ST_EXTRA_DEVS
#define SR_EXTRA_DEVS CONFIG_SR_EXTRA_DEVS
#define SG_EXTRA_DEVS (SD_EXTRA_DEVS + SR_EXTRA_DEVS + ST_EXTRA_DEVS)
Therein lies the rub.  My system is SCSI, but has an IDE CDROM.  So I
didn't bother configuring in the SCSI CD driver, CONFIG_SR_EXTRA_DEVS is
undefined, and things fall apart.
Configuring the CDROM driver as a module enabled me to build the kernel.
This change has broken the orthogonality of the various high-level SCSI
options, and should probably be fixed.  One could imagine something like
the following:
#ifdef CONFIG_SD_EXTRA_DEVS
#  define SD_EXTRA_DEVS CONFIG_SD_EXTRA_DEVS
#else
#  define SD_EXTRA_DEVS 0
# endif
#ifdef CONFIG_ST_EXTRA_DEVS
#  define ST_EXTRA_DEVS CONFIG_ST_EXTRA_DEVS
#else
#  define ST_EXTRA_DEVS 0
# endif
#ifdef CONFIG_SR_EXTRA_DEVS
#  define SR_EXTRA_DEVS CONFIG_SR_EXTRA_DEVS
#else
#  define SR_EXTRA_DEVS 0
# endif
But other variants are possible too...
