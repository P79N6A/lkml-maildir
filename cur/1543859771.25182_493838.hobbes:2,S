If you look at the perfmon-new-base patch, you'll see a base.diff patch which
includes this one. I am slowly getting rid of this requirement by pushing
those "infrastructure patches" to mainline so that the perfmon patch gets
smaller over time. Submitting smaller patches makes it easier for maintainers
to integrate.

I have tried to stay as close as possible from the x86-64 implementation
of this mechanism. The registration entry points are exported to modules,
just like they are for x86-64. Also note that the x86-64 idle notifier does
not have a user at this point, yet it is in the kernel. Perfmon will become
the first user of this mechanism.
