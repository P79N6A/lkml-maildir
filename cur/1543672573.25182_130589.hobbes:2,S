This is not completely true. You can be imprisoned (and "handed over") even as
E.U. citizen to US for violation of US laws. E.U. signed a respective
agreement. As far as I know no case was filed up to now, but that does not mean
it weren't possible.
It was obviously a complete brain-damage of the officials to pass something
like that, it looked a lot like the ongoing case of giving away all E.U.
customer flight data to the US, not only those flighing to the US.
And additionally look at the currently ongoing discussion about the second part
of the new german Urheberrecht which is said to come somewhen this autumn.
There is a clear statement that private copies are illegal after that passed
parliament.

Just wait 6 month and see...
