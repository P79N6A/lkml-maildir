It has to be generic all right, but the VFS is not able to do the job
on its own.  To be useful for indexing, the reported events must
already be persistently recorded, and the VFS has no idea about when
that happens.  The filesystem is the expert on that subject, and it
must generate the events.  I can't imagine a reasonable VFS-level
emulation, or what value the VFS would add by acting as middleman for
a stream of filesystem events.
The natural way to do this is for the filesystem to stream events
directly to the monitoring application over a pipe-like fd.  Maybe a
library for event delivery could be shared by filesystems, to impose
a standard format.  The role of the VFS would be simply to set up the
event connection, or to report that it is not supported.

An event stream accurate enough to support indexing is a considerably
harder problem, I think.
