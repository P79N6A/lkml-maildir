ok, got it (off-list) and you seem to have the default HZ=250. Could you 
change it to HZ=1000 - does the delay get alot smaller?
if yes then this could be roughly the expected worst-case behavior for a 
nice+19 'signalling' task - i'd suggest to try the dont-use-renice patch 
Rusty sent (with the hang it causes fixed), or to change the nice(19) to 
nice(10).
(the rq_clock behavior still looks a bit anomalous, that perhaps 
contributes to the problem.)
