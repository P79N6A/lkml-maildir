	The IA64 port needs a compile option (-mconstant-gp) turned on for the
	kernel but turned off for modules.  gcc only supports the option, not
	its negation, -mno-constant-gp is not valid.
That would be trivial for me to fix, if you wanted a compiler fix for this.
Getting the compiler patch to everyone that needs it might be a little
harder, but shouldn't be a problem.
