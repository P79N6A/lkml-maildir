Looks like the right fix, yes.

Sounds like a bug, yes.
But we still don't update the remaining buffer size and the remaining
array fields which are left after the call. Shouldn't we instead just
change the:
   int (*dev_uevent)(struct device *dev,
                                char **envp, int num_envp,
                                char *buffer, int buffer_size);
to:
  int (*dev_uevent)(struct device *dev,
                               char **envp, int num_envp, int *cur_index,
                               char *buffer, int buffer_size, int *cur_len);
like we do for:
  int add_uevent_var(char **envp, int num_envp, int *cur_index,
                                  char *buffer, int buffer_size, int *cur_len,
                                  const char *format, ...)
and along with the change of the callers, we would update the values
properly, so the next call has the correct numbers? There are 6
classes and something like 12 buses using this method, so it shouldn't
be too much trouble.
Thanks,
Kay
