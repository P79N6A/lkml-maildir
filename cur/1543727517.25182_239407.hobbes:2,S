Subject: A fix for Re: Severe I/O performance regression 2.6.6 to 2.6.7 or 2.6.8-rc3

Taking the 2.6.6-bk6/mm/readahead.c (a one line change from vanilla 2.6.6/mm/readahead.c)
and inserting it into 2.6.7 and 2.6.8-rc3 restores the thread read ahead functionality
and througput seen in the 2.6.6 kernel. This does however reduce the single stream read
performance from 426MB/Sec (under 2.6.8-rc3) to 386MB/Sec (same as 2.6.6).
The major functionality change was to try to detect "random" read performance,
if randomness is detected, then NEVER read ahead. In this case, two threads
using two different file descriptors to the same file read alternating strides
of the file. Since each thread did not do SEQUENTIAL reads, both were treated as random
accesses.
readahead.c needs to look at a little more context, or it needs to increase the size of the
window it uses to detect "randomness". In this case the read stride is 11KB.
A decent minimum window should be at least the stripe size for raid0.
The larger-than-phys-memory file read issue seems to have calmed down with the
readahead.c update. The 10MB/Sec is now 295MB/Sec (it should be 400+MB/Sec).

so kswapd is not out to lunch anymore. I will still have to figure out a peak
value for block size and RASize to see if I can improve large file read performance.
