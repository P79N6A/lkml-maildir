Hi kernel team,
I have been fighting with kernel freezes on my X40 for the 2.6.16-18
kernels (I am using Debian and their kernels). Apparently 2.6.14
works fine, but I can't ever be sure...
You can see my bug log at 
http://bugs.debian.org/394200
I would appreciate if you could look at it; I'd be happy to try
things out if it helps to narrow down the problem.
Cheers,
