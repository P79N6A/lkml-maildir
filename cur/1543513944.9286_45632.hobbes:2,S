It is correct in 99% of cases, provided you do not call backward order
"out-of-order". 8) And it is wrong in the rest 1%.

But how will they work then???

Alas, it is not true. See below.

Fragmented packets almost never intersect borders, so that you will
have no performance implications.

People, attached to internet by single slow serial link, do want
it sometimes. But it is made not because of performance, but because
they want to masquearade or because of wrongly understood security.
People, attached via fast links, cannot use it not because of defragmentation
costs (though it is high in theory, but fragmented packets rarely intersect
borders), but because it creates single failure point, which is very easy
to beat from any point of the globe.
