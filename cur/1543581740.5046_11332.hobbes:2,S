DAMN!  I was _SO_ close!  I'm no sed expert, but I have been
working the last hour or so on nailing this down and here is what
I had:
:0:
* ^Subject:.*testxpert
{
    :0 fWh
    * ^Subject:.*\[Xpert\]
    | sed -e '/^Subject:/ s/\[Xpert\]//g' >> XPERT
}
Didn't work of course, but I got the sed line right by the looks
of it.  Should ever we meet, I'm buying the beer good man!
