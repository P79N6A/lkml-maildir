There's still something fishy going on, and David still has some problems
on his sparc. So don't get all excited yet - we're steadily getting rid of
bugs, but I want to have this stabilize over the next week or so before I
start accepting seriously different patches.
(I've been dropping patches so far, I expect to drop patches for another
week or so - I want this thing _stable_).
