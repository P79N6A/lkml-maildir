Hi,
I could not find a clue on the first try on why xfs needs exportfs.
The Kconfig says "select EXPORTFS if CONFIG_NFSD!=n", but there are no 
occurrences of CONFIG_NFS* or CONFIG_EXP* in any of the files in fs/xfs/.
Did I miss something or this a superfluous line in Kconfig? Interestingly 
tho, `modinfo xfs.ko` returns "exportfs", so I suppose it's somewhere, well 
hidden. If so, where?
Regards,
Jan Engelhardt
