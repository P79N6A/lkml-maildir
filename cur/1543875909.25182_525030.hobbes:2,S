Subject: [Patch -mm 3/3] s390: cio: Delay uevents for subchannels.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

From: Cornelia Huck <cornelia.huck@de.ibm.com>
We often have the situation that we register a subchannel and start
device recognition, only to find out that the device is not usable
after all, which triggers an unregister of the subchannel. This often
happens on hundreds of subchannels on a LPAR, leading to a storm of
events which aren't of any use. Therefore, use uevent_suppress to
delay the KOBJ_ADD uevent for a subchannel until we know that its
ccw_device is to be registered.
