Well, it's back up again now.
I've been using the patches for a couple of months with no problems.
This is on a 4-processor P6 box, so the SMP support seems sound. I only have
a CDRW attached on this SCSI bus so I can't comment on disk support etc.
Kurt, have you submitted this driver to be included into the mainstream
kernel ? It seems solid enough to me.
Regards,
Tim
