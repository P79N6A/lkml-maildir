How about
slab.h:
#ifndef CONFIG_OPTIMIZING_FOR_SIZE
static inline void kfree(const void *p) {
    if(p != NULL)
        __kfree(p);
}
#else
extern void kfree(const void *);
#endif
slab.c:
#ifdef CONFIG_OPTIMIZING_FOR_SIZE
void kfree(const void *p) {
    if(p != NUILL)
        _kfree(p);
}
#endif
That way, you get your time saving with -O2 and your space saving with -Os.
