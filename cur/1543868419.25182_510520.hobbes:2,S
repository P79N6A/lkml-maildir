But the thing is that when you add resources to a platofrm device it
is platform_device_add() that marks resources as busy and therefore it
is not driver's task to delete them. If you want driver to request
resources you better pass them through a private data structure
attached to a device.
The attached resources are normally used by arch setup codes that
posess the knowledge about whether a device is present on a box and
what IO port or memory region is used. The device is usualy there and
its resources fixed and not available to anyone else even if there is
no driver to actually control the device.

platform_device_del() is public so all bets are off...
