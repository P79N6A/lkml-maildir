Steve,
You are totally correct.  I used the wrong words when I said
"ksoftirqd thread runs".  My apologies for very misleading wording.
I have updated the wording in-line below, in the original message to
indicate that it is softirq threads, in the ksoftirqd() function, not
the ksoftirqd thread.

Frank,
This path should not be hit when running with PREEMPT_RT. The softirqs
are now all separate, and are not run in batch in ksoftirqd. In fact,
ksoftirqd should not be running at all with PREEMPT_RT.

           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  should have been:
           the TIMER_SOFTIRQ and RCU_SOFTIRQ softirq threads, which are
           both executing ksoftirqd() run

              the softirq threads, executing in ksoftirqd(), sleep
