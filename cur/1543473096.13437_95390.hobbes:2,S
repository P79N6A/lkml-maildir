Just wanted to say thanks for this thread.  I've been puzzling over tcpdump,
masq debugging, and ppp debugging for the last week or so trying to figure
out why I would have timeouts when collecting mail through my linux box.  I
would NEVER have guessed the MTU/MRU sizes.  Changing to 1500 fixed the
problem.  I prefer 576, but can definitely live with 1500.
