I don't quite understand, the Makefile doesn't care anymore about /bin/sh 
with this patch, the Makefile checks only for $BASH and /bin/bash 
(equivalent to adding "#! /bin/bash" to scripts) and if the latter fails 
it's possible some of our scripts will fail. We could make sure that all 
our scripts are POSIX clean, but is it really worth the effort? It would 
make casual kbuild hacking only even more difficult, as one has to check 
it works with the various shells.

Adding something like try-compile should be possible, but we should be 
careful with this, the more checks we add the more work is done at every 
make invocation.
