drivers/infiniband support both IB and IWARP transports.

Sure, this _could_ be done, but what I think you're missing is that
applications use the interface exported by drivers/infiniband over both
IB -and- IWARP transports.  The application can be written to not care
which transport is used.   Examples of apps that can run over both
transports using the same common interface: 
user mode: MVAPICH2, OMPI, IMPI, HPMPI, 
kernel mode: NFS-RDMA, iSER.  
Note that the include directory used by drivers/infiniband is now
include/rdma.  Perhaps drivers/infiniband should be renamed to
drivers/rdma as well at some point...
Steve.
