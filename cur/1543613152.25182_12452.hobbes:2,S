To clarify: are you saying that normal floppy access cannot work with
devfs=only? I assure you, it works with 2.4.17.

Sorry, scratch what I said, I've just had a chance to look at the
code. OK, the way it's supposed to work is that after the
change_root(), ROOT_DEVICE_NAME points to root_device_name, which
should contain the "final" root device.
But while loading the RD from floppy, it has to use ROOT_DEV, which is
the RD device number. I think what you're wondering is how that can
work if you pass "devfs=only", right? Well, it should work, because
rd.c calls register_blkdev() and *not* devfs_register_blkdev(). So a
call to blkdev_get() should always work.
Does this help?

Fair enough. So do you see anything wrong with this sequence:
	lock_kernel();
	if (devfs_sees_it() && bd_op->owner && try_inc_mod_count(bd_op->owner))
	{
		revalidate();
		__MOD_DEC_USE_COUNT(bd_op->owner);
	}
	unlock_kernel();
Any more problems you can see?
