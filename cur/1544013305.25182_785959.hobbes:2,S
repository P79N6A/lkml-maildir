Asked google and it found following page:
    
http://www.kernel.org/pub/tools/crosstool/
Architecuter   OK?    gcc version
--------------------------------- 
alpha          No     gcc 4.0.2
arm            Yes    gcc 3.4.5
ia64           Yes    gcc 3.4.5
m68k           Yes    gcc 3.4.5
mips           Yes    gcc 3.4.5
sh4            Yes    gcc 3.4.5
sparc          Yes    gcc 3.4.5
sparc64        Yes    gcc 3.4.5
x86_64         Yes    gcc 3.4.5
So from this list of tool chains we can continue to do cross builds
of all except alpha.
But the gcc version is getting ancient..
Why it shall be so hard to do cross build toolchains is above my
imagination but then I also never looked at what it involes.
Added Vegard that maintain these pages.
