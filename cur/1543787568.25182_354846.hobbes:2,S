Here's a totally untested patch. It's guaranteed not to do the "right 
thing", simply because it doesn't _use_ the uid/euid information. But it's 
in the right kind of direction.
If you change the "kill_proc_info()" into a "kill_proc_info_as_uid()" 
call, and add that to kernel/signal.c (which is basically kill_proc_info() 
except it uses the passed-in uid/euid for the "check_kill_permission()" 
tests instead), it should be correct.
As-is, it won't work, because it will use a _random_ uid (whatever is the 
currently running process) for the kill permission. So this really is just 
a "use this as a template" kind of patch, DO NOT APPLY!
