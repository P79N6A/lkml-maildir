This may be the most worthless bug report ever filed, but maybe someone
else is seeing this that can shed some light on the matter.  Everything
was rock-solid with -rc3, but I've had two panics with -rc5 in as many
days.  The first occurred within five minutes of booting.  The second
was after nearly 48 hours of uptime.  Nothing is getting written to
syslog, and the second panic happened while X11 was active, so I didn't
even get so much as a stack dump on the console -- just the flashing
keyboard leds that signaled entry into "brick emulation" mode :-(.
System is a k6-III/450 w/SCSI drives (AIC7XXX) and a Netgear FA311 NIC.
At this point, I have no idea what's triggering the panics.  Doesn't
seem related to load that I can tell...
