Of course. The patch was a simplification, the idea was to just prevent it
from using the default routing; here's a patch that's functionally
equivalent for me:

With that patch I get the same behavior; the timer interrupt is labeled
'local-APIC-edge' and it ticks at the correct rate.

It will be interesting to see if anyone else has problems when systems
with this ATI integrated chipset (Radeon Xpress 200) become more common.
