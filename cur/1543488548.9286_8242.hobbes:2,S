That's normal. Mine's the same.
Linux 2.2.2 (root@tahallah) (gcc egcs-2.91.60) #10 [tahallah.(none)]
Memory:      Total        Used        Free      Shared     Buffers      Cached
Mem:        258084      234848       23236       49508       85052       75396
Swap:       120452           0      120452
The buffers are just cached files. Be thankful it caches that much =) It
makes for a happy speedy machine... 
Cheers,
Alex
