So, we'd have "get_this_cpu(x)" and "set_this_cpu(x, y)".  So far, so good.
	struct myinfo
	{
		int x;
		int y;
	};
	static struct myinfo mystuff __per_cpu_data;
Now how do we set mystuff.x on this CPU?
I just think you're going to have to live with the generic implementation.
It's really not that bad 8)
Sorry,
Rusty.
