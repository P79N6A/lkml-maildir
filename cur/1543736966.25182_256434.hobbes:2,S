So we should make sure that the mailer uses the right mime-type.  I suppose that 
depends on the mailer?

We agree.  Still, I have been bitten too many times by misshandled white space 
to trust pure inlineing.  Likewise on picking it up one would usually past it in 
the mail (I suppose) where as the attachment is through the mailer and less 
prone to missing a character.
The best answer, I think, is attachments that show as inline AND stay that way 
on the reply.
Guild lines on how to insure this are welcome.
