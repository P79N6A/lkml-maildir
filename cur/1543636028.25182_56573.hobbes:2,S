See manpage on "mlockall" system call. Also refer to the "mlock" system call.
I have a tendency to be suspicious of requirements to lock pages
in memory. If this is a dedicated, real-time task, then it is likely
to be "not really real-time" and does not really need to be locking
pages. I would suggest trying the application out without locking pages
first, since the fix for such paging is better handled by adding more
memory to the system instead. Locking pages means that you may get
failures due to the inability to handle short term memory pressure.
Another (cheap) way to prevent paging is to just not mount a swap file.
