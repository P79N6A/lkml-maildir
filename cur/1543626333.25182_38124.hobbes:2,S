Subject: [PATCH] Small cosmetic fix for agpgart

Hi,
I didn't see any maintainer listed for agpgart, should this be
jhartmann@precisioninsight.com?
Anyway, just a cosmetic fix that always bugged me.  
The AMD 760 MP chipset was identified twice as AMD
like so:
Linux agpgart interface v0.99 (c) Jeff Hartmann
agpgart: Maximum main memory to use for agp memory: 816M
agpgart: Detected AMD AMD 760MP chipset
                              ^^^^^^^^^^
This tiny patch will fix it so it appears as:
Linux agpgart interface v0.99 (c) Jeff Hartmann
agpgart: Maximum main memory to use for agp memory: 816M
agpgart: Detected AMD 760MP chipset
Patch is against 2.4.18.
Thanks,
Steven Spence
