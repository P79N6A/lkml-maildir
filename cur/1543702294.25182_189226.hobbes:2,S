You can solve the partitions bit by rescanning when someone opens
the "/dev/hdaX" directory, was my only point. Which was just a little
twist on Linus's thing, only a bit simpler. And no, it doesn't work
unless that dir is a virtual thing that's "magic".

I don't think you should have to press something explicit for the udev
stuff to be correct. But you should to start an application that does
pretty stuff with pictures, like you mention below.

As Linus pointed out ... "every so often" has to be horribly frequent, so
I don't see how that can work. How often are you proposing? once a second?

Ick. You mean like the Windows crap than autoruns stuff off your CD?
If you really, really want that, then yes you'd have to poll, but it
would be nice to solve the partitions bit without that, IMHO. I'd
see a lot more demand for the partitions being correctly populated
than magically triggered GUI stuff.
