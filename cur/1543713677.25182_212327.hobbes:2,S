Nope. Timothy was talking exactly of the same one as you. And I agree with

Assembler. VM is exactly _zero_ overhead. Or C, for a tiny bit more. That
one was already paid for, so you essentially get it for free. Might also
hack FORTH, for a few KiB (dunno how much this days, but should be less
than 10 for a stripped to the bone package).

Nodz!

And how does an _in kernel_ LISP interpreter fit into this picture? Lost me
there...

Now we have common ground...

... of sorts.
Right, I don't want the security kernel inside the kernel crashing. But
then again, I don't want the driver for the hard disk, or the mouse, or
even the graphic card, scribbling over memory either. Guess you'd (re)write
the whole kernel in some LISP dialect then? Good luck! But this is
_certainly_ the worst list to discuss such a design.

You know little...

OK, so you need the policy to be interpreted in-kernel (dunno why a
largeish high-level general purpose language is needed for that, when a
tiny interpreter for a specialized language will do very well, and has been
shown to work fine), and written in a "high level language" so that your
garden variety sysadmin _can_ write her own policy, but it really doesn't
matter because she'll never have to do so...
Completely lost me.
