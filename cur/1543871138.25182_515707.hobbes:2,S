NUMA doesn't help you. Linux only runs on cache-coherent NUMA,
which this isn't.

You definitely can't use the cache mode in this case, but one idea
that should make atomic instructions work is to always do these
on one of the two cores, and use cross-core interrupts to trigger
an update. It's probably pretty inefficient and you also need to
do something about atomic updates (spinlock_t and atomic_t) when
interrupts are disabled.

It's the same.
