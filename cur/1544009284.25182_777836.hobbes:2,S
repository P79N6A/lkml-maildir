Either you have something that uses a vast amount of I/O bounce buffer
space or something is leaking it. In the end someone leaked enough that
the disk driver couldn't allocate bounce buffers.
Rather than the gigantic hal dump can you provide an lspci and an lsmod
output. That will give some idea what devices are in use and may help
identify the potential cause.
