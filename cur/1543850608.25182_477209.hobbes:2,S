Subject: NFS problem (r/o filesystem) with 2.6.19-rc3

Hi,
 yesterday I moved this desktop box to -rc3 from 2.6.18.  I have a
large amount of data on nfs mounts (r/w) and everything looks good.
But, for my backups I have cron jobs to mount a different nfs
filesystem and rsync to it.  That fails with 2.6.19-rc3, giving me
messages like
about to mount /nfs
Sat Oct 28 18:45:03 BST 2006 rsyncing
rsync: failed to set times on "/nfs/bluesbreaker/boot/.": Read-only
file system (30)
rsync: mkstemp "/nfs/bluesbreaker/boot/.map.c2Cj91" failed:
Read-only file system (30)
rsync: mkstemp
"/nfs/bluesbreaker/boot/.vmlinuz-2.6.19-rc3-sda8.pXKgH9" failed:
Read-only file system (30)
rsync: failed to set times on "/nfs/bluesbreaker/boot/.": Read-only
file system (30)
rsync error: some files could not be transferred (code 23) at
main.c(791)
rsync failed
umounting /nfs
 If I mount it manually, it seems to be ok -
root@bluesbreaker /home/ken #mount
/dev/sda8 on / type auto (rw)
[...]
deepthought:/data/staging on /nfs type nfs (rw,hard,intr,tcp,addr=192.168.0.10)
root@bluesbreaker /home/ken #
 But if I then try to touch a file I find the filesystem is r/o -
root@bluesbreaker /home/ken #touch /nfs/bluesbreaker/boot/vmlinuz-2.6.18-sda8 
touch: cannot touch `/nfs/bluesbreaker/boot/vmlinuz-2.6.18-sda8':
Read-only file system
 This filesystem is a 'staging' area where whichever of my desktop
machines are up can write.  From a different box using a 2.6.17.13
kernel the filesystem is r/w.  The system log on the machine running
rc3 only shows that rsync ended in error, there are no associated
kernel messages. 
 Suggestions, please ?
Ken
