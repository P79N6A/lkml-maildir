They are both correct. It is not agressive enough if there are tasks other
than those two that are at the same static priority level and ready to run.
It is too agressive if the task it is swapped with is at a lower static
priority level.
Perhaps it might be possible to scan for the task at the same static
priority level that is ready-to-run but last in line among other
ready-to-run tasks and put it after that task? I think that's about as close
as we can get to the POSIX-specified behavior.

Just in case this isn't clear, I like CFS too and sincerely appreciate the
work Ingo, Con, and others have done on it.
