Thanks so much for this info.  Does this mean that given the siginfo_t
and sigcontext pointers, one cannot find this address anywhere by
poking around at a specified offset, or something?  Roman Hodek came
up with the following rather elaborate scheme for m68k:
=============================================================================
/* GET_FAULT_ADDR is a bit complicated to implement on m68k, because the fault
   address can't be found directly in the sigcontext. One has to look at the
   CPU frame, and that one is different for each CPU.
   */
#define GET_FAULT_ADDR(sig,code,sv,a) \
    ({															\
		struct sigcontext *scp = (struct sigcontext *)(sv);		\
		int format = (scp->sc_formatvec >> 12) & 0xf;			\
		unsigned long *framedata = (unsigned long *)(scp + 1);	\
		unsigned long ea;										\
		if (format == 0xa || format == 0xb)						\
			/* 68020/030 */										\
			ea = framedata[2];									\
		else if (format == 7)									\
			/* 68040 */											\
			ea = framedata[3];									\
		else if (format == 4) {									\
			/* 68060 */											\
			ea = framedata[0];									\
			if (framedata[1] & 0x08000000)						\
				/* correct addr on misaligned access */			\
				ea = (ea+4095)&(~4095);							\
		}														\
		ea;														\
	})
#endif
=============================================================================
Is there any analog for arm (or alpha, sparc, etc. for that matter)
for current 2.2.x kernels?
Thanks again!
