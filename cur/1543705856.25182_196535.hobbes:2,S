Well, my temp is about 6-9°C hotter in idle mode, but with current 
kernels APIC (and no CPU diconnect) seems to be more stable than PIC and 
CPU Disconnect with my nforce. I at least don't have problems with 
forcedeth driver and current acpi.

I remember Jesse Allan sending some lspci outputs to Bart to investigate 
the BIOS fix. I wonder what has happened to it. I tried to do a 
comparison with my values, but due to lack of some smart tools to show 
what is common and what is not (diff is not very suitable) it is very 
hard, esp if you have no knowledge about the actual meanings of those 
parameters.
