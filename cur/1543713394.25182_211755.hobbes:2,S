Hi Ben !
I don't want to be too critical or harsh or whatever, but why don't you
just send such fixes right upstream instead of stacking patches for a
while in your repo ? From my experience, such "batching" of patches is
the _wrong_ thing to do, and typically, there is a major useability
issue with sbp2 that could have been "right" in 2.6.5 final and will not
be (so we'll have to wait what ? 1 or 2 monthes more now to have a
release kernel with a reliable sbp2)
Ben.
