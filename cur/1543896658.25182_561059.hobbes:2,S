Saying "protect data" is nearly meaningless without a threat model.
I bet you don't try to protect data from a direct nuclear hit, or a
court order.
AA has a fairly clear threat model.  It involves a flaw in a
program being used by an external agent to cause it to use
privileges it would not normally exercise to subvert privacy or
integrity.
I think this model matches a lot of real threats that real sysadmins
have real concerns about.  I believe that the design of AA addresses
this model quite well. 
What is your threat model?  Maybe it is just different.
