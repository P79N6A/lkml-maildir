I think great effort has gone in to removing so-called "StudlyCaps" 
from the ppc64 iSeries code... :)
Also, I didn't see "MFC" defined anywhere... it's sort of a pet peeve, 
but could you make sure all your acronyms are defined? Most of them are 
described in spu.h, but a few slipped through I think (like "SMF").
And while a comment at the top of every file is great, ones like this:

might be more helpful if they defined SPU and further mentioned it's 
the coprocessor in the Broadband Processor Architecture...
