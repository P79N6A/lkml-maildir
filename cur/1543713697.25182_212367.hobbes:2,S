It's this one.  If I wait until it locks up - it did at exactly 600,001
interrupts, interesting... then reload the module with this:
        //check if the interrupt is ours.
        if (!(hwread(vortex->mmio, VORTEX_STAT) & 0x1))
{
		printk ("vortex: Interrupt not ours\n");
                return IRQ_NONE;
}
I get _exactly_ 100,000 copies of that printout, and then the interrupt
is disabled with a 'nobody cares' response.  The first time, all
100,000 were on CPU0; the second time, 2 were on CPU0 and the other
99,998 on CPU1.
So it looks as if something gets wedged, and then the interrupt fires
continuously for no reason.
