Hello!

What I'm arguing about is that the fsuid check is obscure (it breaks
traditional semantics of file permissions [*], it doesn't allow an user
to grant access to his user mount to other users, even if the permissions
allow that and so on) and it doesn't fully solve the problem anyway.
For similar reasons, I don't advocate for private namespaces either.
The cure more likely lies in simple policy rules like the "all user mounts
belong to /mnt/usr" one, instead of putting dubious policy to the kernel.
				Have a nice fortnight
