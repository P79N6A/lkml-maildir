But lets look at a simple version of my original code anyway ;-)
Writer:
void add_op(struct myops *x) {
	/* x->next may be garbage here */
	x->next = global_p;
	smp_wmb();
	global_p = x;
}
Reader:
void read_op(void)
{
	struct myops *p = global_p;
	while (p != NULL) {
		p->func();
		p = next;
		/* if p->next is garbage we crash */
	}
}
Here, we are missing the read_barrier_depends(). Lets look at the Alpha
cache issue:
reader reads the new version of global_p, and then reads the next
pointer. But since the next pointer is on a different cacheline than
global_p, it may have somehow had that in it's cache still. So it uses the
old next pointer which contains the garbage.
Is that correct?
But I will have to admit, that I can't see how an aggressive compiler
might have screwed this up. Being that x is a parameter, and the function
add_op is not in a header file.
