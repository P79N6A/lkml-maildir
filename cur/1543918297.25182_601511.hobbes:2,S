I've been testing 2.6.23-rc9 + this patch all morning but have just seen
a lockup. As usual it happened  just after a large file copy finished
and while nr_dirty is still large. I'm sorry to say I didn't have a
serial console running so I don't have an other info. I will try again
and see if I can capture some more data.
I did notice that at the beginning of my tests the dirty blocks are
written back more quickly than usual
nr_dirty count after the copy finished and then 60 seconds later :-
after copy	+60 seconds
73520		0
73533		0
68554		1
but after several iterations of my testcase & just before the lockup
68560		57165
71974		62896
which is about the same as a unpatched kernel.
