This code runs within an initcall, so it is very unlikely that anything
will race with us here.
But SMP is up, and this code gets dropped out of memory later (the
out-of-line spinlock code doesn't get dropped though).
So yes, I'd prefer that the locking be there, if only for documentary
purposes.  A /* comment */ which explains why the locking was omitted would
also be suitabe.
