hi,
  I will make it short. I have a program in 2.0.36 who work all
  the time. My special config that I think is important is that in my 
  rc.S  I invoke "update -f 30"  rather than the default (i think 5sec)
  My program create 8 thousands directories and 8 thousands files
  in a few seconds, (may be 120).
  On 2.0.36 kernel, he create about 1300,  then he goes to sleep while the
  "/sbin/update" update the write-thru cache to disk, and then resume 
  working as he supposed to do, and complete the job, a step at a time.
  On 2.2.* (*=any), when he goes first to sleep (ps show STAT 'D'), update
  does the work, but after that, the cpu goes to 0%  and my program never 
  resume the work. 
  In that state (ps show STAT 'D') he cannot even be killed -TERM nor kill -9
  Only reboot can get rid of that process.
  I removed the "-f 30" on /sbin/update, and now the program work ok
  but obviously there may be a bug somewhere.
  The important thing should be: When "update" is invoked by his
  own timeout,  everything is fine.  When "update" is invoked 
  because of a starving of write cache process, he forgot to resume
  the process who where stopped by the starving and waiting on him.
