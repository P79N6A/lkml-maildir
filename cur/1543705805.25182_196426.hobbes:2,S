Hello all,
It turns out that you can easily change the kernel name, version,
etc., even on a running kernel.
Everything you need is already exported.
A very easy module and test program is attached.
Script started on Thu Feb  5 14:24:20 2004
# ./tester
Usage:
./tester <Item> <string>
Items are SYSNAME, NODENAME, RELEASE, VERSION, MACHINE, DOMAIN
# ./tester SYSNAME foo
Can't open device file, UNAME
Maybe `insmod` the driver?
# insmod unamedrvr.o
# ./tester sysname foo
# uname -a
foo chaos 2.4.24 #1 SMP Wed Feb 4 11:50:33 EST 2004 i686
# ./tester sysname Linux
You have new mail in /var/spool/mail/root
# uname -a
Linux chaos 2.4.24 #1 SMP Wed Feb 4 11:50:33 EST 2004 i686
# ./tester nodename bar
# uname -a
Linux bar 2.4.24 #1 SMP Wed Feb 4 11:50:33 EST 2004 i686
# ./tester node chaos
# uname -a
Linux chaos 2.4.24 #1 SMP Wed Feb 4 11:50:33 EST 2004 i686
# ./tester releas 1.1
