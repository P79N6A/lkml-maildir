This, again, is a presentation issue, and is irrelevant to the
intricacies of fixed-point arithmetric.

Does it really matter NOW?  No.  However, 1 cK is a convenient unit
and a good use of bits.  Can we guarantee it won't matter in the
future, especially not on a CPU which may very well require complex
algorithms to eke out optimal performance in a thermally-challenged
environment (more than just simple trip points.)  Now it gets
interesting!  I have actually seen, in the lab, an algorithm which
required complex guesswork, because it required information below the
noise level of the sensor (and yes, it *is* possible to obtain that
information.)
