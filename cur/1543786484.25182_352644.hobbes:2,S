Subject: [tg3] failing to detect NIC when built statically...

I have a PCI express BCM5751 NIC using the tg3 driver. If I build the
driver statically, it fails to identify the network card - no kernel
log messages or anything. It works as expected when built modular.
Platform is x86_64 running native 64bit code.
