Oh ok. Well can we resuscitate this patch? The AFS NAS head example is a
good reason to do this.
If you need any help please let me know and I will be happy to test/adapt
the patch in/to the version that you may want to apply it.
We have one version for 2.4.18 that someone created recently if the one you
have is too old...
Thanks, Juan

I know Matthew had the patches, and I know I looked at them and they
seemed sane enough. But I don't know where they eventually went. Things
like NFS over AFS are going to need it
