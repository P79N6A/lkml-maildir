Hi,
Although I know the basics of CVS I wondered if there are some
resources/documents that provide useful tips for maintaining local changes
and keeping in sync with the main (what I called "LBT") branch of Linux
kernel?
I do the straightforward thing of importing official trees with tags like
LBT-2-3-29, LBT-2-3-30 etc and it seems to work for my needs but if there
are some clever Linux-kernel-specific hints and tips I will appreciate
them.
Thanks,
