No, you're not. You're a case that needs to be handled, but not a special

The new kernel resource code should act the same as the old one. There was
a short while (ie pre-3 - pre-5) where it didn't because it was in
development, but there is absolutely nothing in the resource code that
can't handle it.
If vgacon/fbcon need to synchronize, that's a driver issue.
