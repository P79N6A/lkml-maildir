  Yes, but XFS doesn't give a damn about what we do in VFS with quotas ;)
So we are speaking here only about quotas implemented in VFS and these need
writing. BTW: When filesystem is remounted read-only, quota information
shouldn't change so it doesn't matter whether you turn it off or leave it
on. The only difference is that when you later remount rw, you have to turn
quotas on again.

  Oh yes... there are some similarities ;). But quota was first! ;)
