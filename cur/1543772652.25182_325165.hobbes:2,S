nanosleep, according to the documation is supposed to sleep
"at least" the 'struct timespec' time. It can return in
a shorter time as a result of a signal and, if so, the
input time-values will be updated accordingly. The resolution
is limited to the HZ value. This means that it will, unless
interrupted, always sleep at least 1 / HZ seconds (about 1 ms
on current x86 distributions).
FYI, there is no 'fine resolution' timer available on any
Linux-ported platform that could take advantage of the nanosecond
input resolution of the function.
