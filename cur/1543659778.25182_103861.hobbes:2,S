    Hi Jon :)
> exec("/proc/self/exe", ...)
    That's good, but I would like to avoid to mount procfs: what if
the mount point '/proc' doesn't exist? If you create it, you must
mount root rw and remount ro again, not a very good idea if it
haven't been fscked yet, for example. You can mount under /tmp, if it
exists at all, but that simply displaces the problem. What if
/proc/self/exe is not part form procfs, but from some evil user ;))
    Thanks a lot for your answer :)
