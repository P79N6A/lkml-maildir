Yep, in fbmem.c the name entry is "sisfb" as opposed to just "sis". Also, the
driver requires that the mode is passed video a "mode:" argument as is
outlined in the sisfb_setup(). Take a look at drivers/video/sis/sis_main.h,
specifically sisbios_mode[] for a list of supported modes.
Something like:
video=sisfb:mode:640x480x32
should do the job.
