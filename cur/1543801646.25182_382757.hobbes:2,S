Our menus are mostly made for _users_.
The more common are users accidentially enabling CONFIG_BROKEN and then 
wondering why a driver isn't compiling or working.
And in my experience, when searching whether hardware might be supported 
a grep through the kernel sources brings you more than reading often 
outdated Kconfig help texts. Besides this, a BROKEN driver usually has 
the same value for the user as a non-existing driver.

In reality, people accidentially turn on CONFIG_BROKEN, enable a broken 
driver, and wonder why it isn't working as expected.
If you know the driver is marked as BROKEN and if you want to use it 
despite this, editing the Kconfig file is trivial.
Unless you _really_ know what you are doing, no driver for your hard 
disk is better than a broken driver.
