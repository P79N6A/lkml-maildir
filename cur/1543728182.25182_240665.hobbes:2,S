That may well be true, but it's not a reason to not support the full
file size of iso9660 filesystems.
If my interpretation of the spec is correct, and I believe that it is,
then the max file size of an iso9660 filesystem is 4 GB. If it's not the
case, then mkisofs should be changed to not support such filesystems.
(Ignoring the recent fun with Joerg on LKML)
