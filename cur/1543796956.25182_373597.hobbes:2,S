Then how about a "formal" linux certified logo? IOW a logo that can *only* 
be used if the hardware has drivers that were written using an officially 
supplied set of specifications and if said drivers are available under an 
OSI certified licence. Any use of the logo on a piece of hardware that is 
not certified would be liable to legal action.
Admittedly this would require a fair amount of effort to set up and uphold 
but if it helped make it easier to choose compatible hardware it could be 
worth it.
