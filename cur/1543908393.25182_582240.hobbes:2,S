Skipping the obvious ones such as correct, up-to-date etc.
o Readable as-is
o Grepable
o buildable as structured documents or almost like a single book
o Easy to replicate structure
o Maintainable in any decent text-editor (emacs, vim, whatever)

Asciidoc is quite close to plaintext and it looks to me that the
formatting possibilities are quite good.
I spend an hour experimenting a little with
Documentation/kbuild/makefiles.txt.
Diff below shows quite a lot of changes but for the most
this is removal of the indent tab.
Most likely I could have tweaked asciidoc to accept this
but wanted to use default config.
The resulting html page can be seen here:
http://www.ravnborg.org/kbuild/makefiles.html
Produced using:
asciidoc -a toc -a numbered makefiles.txt
I would say that the asciidoc formatted plaintext text
are readable despite the simple markup.
And someone coming later will have no problems to follow
the original markup.
Btw. is is not a full conversion, I stopped after a few chapters.
asciidoc should be able to produce the index automatically
but I had no luck but then I did not try hard either.

 Most Makefiles within the kernel are kbuild Makefiles that use the
 kbuild infrastructure. This chapter introduces the syntax used in the
@@ -113,141 +76,141 @@ file will be used.
 Section 3.1 "Goal definitions" is a quick intro, further chapters provide
 more details, with real examples.
 
---- 3.1 Goal definitions
-
-	Goal definitions are the main part (heart) of the kbuild Makefile.
-	These lines define the files to be built, any special compilation
-	options, and any subdirectories to be entered recursively.
-
-	The most simple kbuild makefile contains one line:
-
-	Example:
-		obj-y += foo.o
-
-	This tells kbuild that there is one object in that directory, named
-	foo.o. foo.o will be built from foo.c or foo.S.
-
-	If foo.o shall be built as a module, the variable obj-m is used.
-	Therefore the following pattern is often used:
-
-	Example:
-		obj-$(CONFIG_FOO) += foo.o
-
-	$(CONFIG_FOO) evaluates to either y (for built-in) or m (for module).
-	If CONFIG_FOO is neither y nor m, then the file will not be compiled
-	nor linked.
-
---- 3.2 Built-in object goals - obj-y
-
-	The kbuild Makefile specifies object files for vmlinux
-	in the $(obj-y) lists.  These lists depend on the kernel
-	configuration.
-
-	Kbuild compiles all the $(obj-y) files.  It then calls
-	"$(LD) -r" to merge these files into one built-in.o file.
-	built-in.o is later linked into vmlinux by the parent Makefile.
-
-	The order of files in $(obj-y) is significant.  Duplicates in
-	the lists are allowed: the first instance will be linked into
-	built-in.o and succeeding instances will be ignored.
-
-	Link order is significant, because certain functions
-	(module_init() / __initcall) will be called during boot in the
-	order they appear. So keep in mind that changing the link
-	order may e.g. change the order in which your SCSI
-	controllers are detected, and thus your disks are renumbered.
-
-	Example:
-		#drivers/isdn/i4l/Makefile
-		# Makefile for the kernel ISDN subsystem and device drivers.
-		# Each configuration option enables a list of files.
-		obj-$(CONFIG_ISDN)             += isdn.o
-		obj-$(CONFIG_ISDN_PPP_BSDCOMP) += isdn_bsdcomp.o
-
---- 3.3 Loadable module goals - obj-m
-
-	$(obj-m) specify object files which are built as loadable
-	kernel modules.
-
-	A module may be built from one source file or several source
-	files. In the case of one source file, the kbuild makefile
-	simply adds the file to $(obj-m).
-
-	Example:
-		#drivers/isdn/i4l/Makefile
-		obj-$(CONFIG_ISDN_PPP_BSDCOMP) += isdn_bsdcomp.o
-
-	Note: In this example $(CONFIG_ISDN_PPP_BSDCOMP) evaluates to 'm'
-
-	If a kernel module is built from several source files, you specify
-	that you want to build a module in the same way as above.
-
-	Kbuild needs to know which the parts that you want to build your
-	module from, so you have to tell it by setting an
-	$(<module_name>-objs) variable.
-
-	Example:
-		#drivers/isdn/i4l/Makefile
-		obj-$(CONFIG_ISDN) += isdn.o
-		isdn-objs := isdn_net_lib.o isdn_v110.o isdn_common.o
-
-	In this example, the module name will be isdn.o. Kbuild will
-	compile the objects listed in $(isdn-objs) and then run
-	"$(LD) -r" on the list of these files to generate isdn.o.
-
-	Kbuild recognises objects used for composite objects by the suffix
-	-objs, and the suffix -y. This allows the Makefiles to use
-	the value of a CONFIG_ symbol to determine if an object is part
-	of a composite object.
-
-	Example:
-		#fs/ext2/Makefile
-	        obj-$(CONFIG_EXT2_FS)        += ext2.o
-		ext2-y                       := balloc.o bitmap.o
-	        ext2-$(CONFIG_EXT2_FS_XATTR) += xattr.o
-
-	In this example, xattr.o is only part of the composite object
-	ext2.o if $(CONFIG_EXT2_FS_XATTR) evaluates to 'y'.
-
-	Note: Of course, when you are building objects into the kernel,
-	the syntax above will also work. So, if you have CONFIG_EXT2_FS=y,
-	kbuild will build an ext2.o file for you out of the individual
-	parts and then link this into built-in.o, as you would expect.
-
---- 3.4 Objects which export symbols
-
-	No special notation is required in the makefiles for
-	modules exporting symbols.
-
---- 3.5 Library file goals - lib-y
-
-	Objects listed with obj-* are used for modules, or
-	combined in a built-in.o for that specific directory.
-	There is also the possibility to list objects that will
-	be included in a library, lib.a.
-	All objects listed with lib-y are combined in a single
-	library for that directory.
-	Objects that are listed in obj-y and additionally listed in
-	lib-y will not be included in the library, since they will
-	be accessible anyway.
-	For consistency, objects listed in lib-m will be included in lib.a.
-
-	Note that the same kbuild makefile may list files to be built-in
-	and to be part of a library. Therefore the same directory
-	may contain both a built-in.o and a lib.a file.
-
-	Example:
-		#arch/i386/lib/Makefile
-		lib-y    := checksum.o delay.o
-
-	This will create a library lib.a based on checksum.o and delay.o.
-	For kbuild to actually recognize that there is a lib.a being built,
-	the directory shall be listed in libs-y.
-	See also "6.3 List directories to visit when descending".
-
-	Use of lib-y is normally restricted to lib/ and arch/*/lib.
