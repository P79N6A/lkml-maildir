Subject: [PATCH] Multiple IO-APIC boot failure in all 2.4 kernels
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This one's extremely wierd.  It may only affect Intel Alder derived 
motherboards (that's all I have with dual apics).  They refuse to boot all 2.4 
kernels SMP.
The problem is due to these errors:
PCI: Error while updating region 00:0f.0/1 (20000408 != 20000008)
PCI: Error while updating region 00:0f.0/2 (20000808 != 20000008)
PCI: Error while updating region 00:0f.0/3 (20000c08 != 20000008)
PCI: Error while updating region 00:0f.0/4 (20001008 != 20000008)
PCI: Error while updating region 00:0f.0/5 (20001408 != 20000008)
Beore the attempt to update this PCI resource, the secondary IO-APIC was 
mapped correctly.  However, after poking this region, the secondary IO-APIC 
disappears and consequently all interrupts routed through this io-apic are not 
delivered and the machine hangs.
The PCI details are:
00:0f.0 Class ff00: 8086:0008
        Subsystem: 1008:fec0
        Flags: fast devsel
        Memory at 20000000 (32-bit, prefetchable)
        Memory at 20000400 (32-bit, prefetchable)
        Memory at 20000800 (32-bit, prefetchable)
        Memory at 20000c00 (32-bit, prefetchable)
        Memory at 20001000 (32-bit, prefetchable)
        Memory at 20001400 (32-bit, prefetchable)
The attached patch works on the assumption that all things of class 0xff00 are 
some type of IO-APIC and prevents pcibios_update_resource() from poking it.  
However if anyone has a better suggestion, I'm open to trying it.
