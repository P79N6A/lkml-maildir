The problem has come up a few times more on this list
(and no doubt more frequently outside).
The semantics of the partition table for disks with a sector size
different from 512 has been changed in 2.2.3.
It is rumoured that the new behaviour is the correct one.
Nevertheless, this change bites many people, and should be optional.
The present state of affairs is that you have to rewrite your 2.2.2
partition table for 2.2.3. (By taking all entries and dividing them
by four.) Remind me to mail you a program that does this - write to
aeb@cwi.nl.
