IMHO capabilities can be stored on the same block as the ACL of an inode. We
already have an ACL pointer in ext2 inodes. The on-disk format of the Linux ACL
project at <
http://acl.bestbits.at/>
 already has four reserved 32-bit fields.
These are intended for storing capabilities or similar.
I'm currently working on improving the ACL cache. One of the goals is support
for capabilities.
