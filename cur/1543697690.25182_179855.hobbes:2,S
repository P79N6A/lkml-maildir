this should be ok.  we already have multiple definitions for such a
case.

sound/isa/cs423x/cs4236.c includes the following ids:
static struct pnp_card_device_id snd_cs423x_pnpids[] = {
	/* Intel Marlin Spike Motherboard - CS4235 */
	{ .id = "CSC0225", .devs = { { "CSC0000" }, { "CSC0010" }, { "CSC0003" } } },
	/* Intel Marlin Spike Motherboard (#2) - CS4235 */
	{ .id = "CSC0225", .devs = { { "CSC0100" }, { "CSC0110" }, { "CSC0103" } } },
also within the same list:
	/* Dell Optiplex GX1 - CS4236B */
	{ .id = "CSC6835", .devs = { { "CSC0000" }, { "CSC0010" }, { "CSC0003" } } },
	/* Dell P410 motherboard - CS4236B */
	{ .id = "CSC6835", .devs = { { "CSC0000" }, { "CSC0010" } } },
the latter is fallback for the board without MPU401.

ok, that what i expected.
