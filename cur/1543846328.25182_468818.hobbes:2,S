AMD64 Dual Opteron system with a self-compiled kernel from stock sources, 
Debian base.
SATA card is a Promise SATAII300 TX4, here is the lspci entry:
0000:01:03.0 Unknown mass storage controller: Promise Technology, Inc.: Unknown device 3d17 (rev 02)
I was tracking 2.6.16 all the way up to .27, when it showed this 
behavior.  I then tried tried 2.6.17.13, and got the same result.  The logs 
below are from the attempt with 2.6.17.13.
During normal system operation, with no load, I tried pulling a SATA drive 
from the promise controller (in this case "ata1" which is sda) in order to 
test the system being able to handle a drive failure.
I immediately got this in the syslog:
Oct  2 16:14:43 stock kernel: irq 16: nobody cared (try booting with the "irqpoll" option)
Oct  2 16:14:43 stock kernel:

Oct  2 16:14:43 stock kernel: Disabling IRQ #16
After this, all four of the disks on the Promise controller stopped working, 
I am assuming because of the interrupt being disabled, even though the other 
three should have been just fine.
This is a partial log of console errors after the IRQ was disabled (all that 
I was able to grab since I couldn't access any disks anymore).

Similar messages continued to be printed to the console, and any disk 
accesses continued to fail.  I waited about a half hour to see if the system 
would ever recover, and it never did.
I'd be happy to provide any additional information that may be helpful.
