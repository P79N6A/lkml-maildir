As I understand this, the only reason u lock is 
1) In an SMP or multiprocessor system, you suspect somebody else is running
   simultaneously with you, this can lead to two or more processors executing
   the same code simultaneously, this may lead to races.(which u do not want).
2) In a Multiprocessor or uniprocesor, data is shared among user processes in the kernel
   or
   between a user process in the kernel and an interrupt context
  (like an irq handler or a bottom half or a tasklet).
So if u have a situation where (2) does not hold and u have a multiprocessor system,
per CPU data need not be locked, since it is not visible/used by other processors.
Did I get it right?
