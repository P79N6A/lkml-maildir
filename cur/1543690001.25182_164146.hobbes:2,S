Context: Peter experiences very bad network performance with 2.4.22 - it 
looks like 99% packet drop or something like that. The packet drop 
disappears if CONFIG_L1_CACHE_SHIFT is set to 7 (i.e. 128 byte cache 
line size). 2.4.21 works.
The network cards are some kind of atm cards. Several systems are 
affected - at least Pentium II and PPro systems.
Peter: what's the exact brand and nic driver that you use? Could you try 
to figure out what exactly breaks? I'd use "ping -f -s 1500", perhaps 
together with "tcpdump -s 1500 -x" on both ends.
