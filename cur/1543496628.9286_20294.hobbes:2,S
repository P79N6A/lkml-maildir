    The reason I said "there have also been claims" is because it's true:
    Such claims HAVE been made, so I would be lying if I said otherwise.
Thanks for warning us that you go around blindly repeating
the nonsense that people say.
    The ONLY case I have come across of a utility with anything resembling
    such a problem is mkisofs, which is considerably slower when creating
    the image in a 2.1G partition than when creating the same image in a
    1.9G partition
Excellent. So, no mangled partitions but just a rumour that in a certain
situation, on a certain machine a certain program was slower on a big
partition.
Just to convince myself that there is no problem here, I created a mkisofs image
on four ext2 partitions on the same disk, where these partitions had sizes
1.5 GB, 1.9 GB, 2.1 GB, 4.5 GB. The timings were, respectively
on 1.5GB partition: real 347.81, user 12.53, sys 41.62
on 1.9GB partition: real 345.45, user 11.91, sys 41.08
on 2.1GB partition: real 344.20, user 12.34, sys 41.18
on 4.5GB partition: real 321.48, user 11.86, sys 40.85
No significant correlation between partition size and time,
I would say. In fact the times are surprisingly uniform.
[This was Linux 2.3.3 on a 64 MB Pentium 166 MHz and a 17 GB Maxtor disk model 91728D8.]
The conclusion must be that the unqualified statement
"mkisofs is considerably slower in a 2.1G than in a 1.9G partition"
is false. If mkisofs is slower in one situation than in another
then we must ask: which partition was closest to the outer rim
of the disk? how fragmented were the filesystems? Etc.
So, for the time being, no one has shown any problem with large partitions.
