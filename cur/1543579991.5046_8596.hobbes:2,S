As stated previously: I think this is a proven improbability and I have
not seen any code or designs from you to show otherwise.

I suggest that you get your hearing checked. I'm fully in favor of sensible
low latency Linux. I believe however that low latency  in Linux will
	A. be "soft realtime", close to deadline most of the time.
	B. millisecond level on present hardware
	C. Best implemented by careful algorithm design instead of 
	"stuff the kernel with resched points" and hope for the best.
RTLinux main focus is hard realtime: a few microseconds here and there
are critical for us and for the applications we target. For consumer
audio, this is overkill and vanilla Linux should be able to provide
services reasonably well. But ...

Nice marketing line, but it is not working code.
