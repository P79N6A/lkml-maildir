For drivers built into the kernel that gets messy.  The command line is
only so long.  Sounds messy for modules too.  Further (responding to
your other e-mail), few probably care about having the mixer containing
default, not custom, values for 10 seconds between driver init and aumix
execution from initscripts...
It sounds smarter to delay mixer initialization, or mute all mixer
channels at init.  That effectively initializes the mixer channels to
the custom values you desire, without having to add special case module
gunk for the subset of people who need correct mixer values Right
Now(tm).
