And error register value 0x84 - ICRC (CRC error on ATA bus) and ABRT
(command abort) - agrees with what SError indicates.  You're
experiencing transmission errors.

Also, firmware on some harddrives die solidly when transmission errors
occur.  Maybe yours is one.  There's nothing much the driver can do
about both the transmission error and the drive locking up afterward.
If the transmission errors occur frequently, the chance is that either
your drive or power supply is dying.  As for the drive lock up, maybe
firmware update will help.
* "smartctl -a /dev/sda" might report something interesting.
* Connect the drive to different SATA and power connector and see if the
problem persists.
* Connect the drive to a separate power supply and see if the problem
persists.
