I'm not sure that this is a specific kernel issue or not, but here goes...
I have a distro (hand compiled) running off of a CF card that's booting from
a Soekris (Elan SC520) net4501(and net4521) with the console kernel cmdline
set to ttyS0,19200n81, and the kernel messages show up fine and everything
over my serial terminal, but when the kernel goes to execute /sbin/init or
whatever I set init equal to (after the "Freeing unused kernel memory" bit),
nothing happens, init doesn't get executed (or I cannot see it). This same
CF card boots and runs fine from a normal PC, but from any Elan I have, init
never gets executed. What is wrong here?
Thanks...
