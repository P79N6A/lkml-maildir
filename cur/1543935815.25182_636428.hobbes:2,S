Someone in #git had a similar problem today. Conclusion was that x86/mm
is not "stable" in the sense that commits are only added, instead
history gets rewritten. That breaks pull/merge/"basic rebase".
Basically, you'll want to "rebase --onto", taking your local commits
from the old branch history to the new branch history. One way to make
that bearable is to have two branches (or a branch and a tag). One
branch is used to keep your work, the other branch (or tag) is used to
"mark" where the old upstream ended and your work started.
Assuming that your remote is called "x86", this could look like this:
git branch myStuff x86/mm
git branch myStuff_start x86/mm
work work work commit commit commit
git fetch x86 mm
git rebase --onto x86/mm myStuff_start myStuff
git branch -f myStuff_start x86/mm
The rebase will take all of the commits that you added to myStuff, on
top of the old x86/mm (referred to by myStuff_start) and try to apply
them on top of the new x86/mm, updating myStuff to point to the rebased
commits afterwards.
Then myStuff_start is updated to point to the now current start of your
stuff, so that you can do the rebase again later.
That's not actually a problem of git's tracking branches, because
they're not made for that style of work at all. For such stuff, rebase
is the only useful option AFAIK.
HTH,
Björn
