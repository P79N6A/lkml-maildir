Seven seconds? How much memory is in use when you start, and how much is
actually written to disk? If you're starting with 1GB of RAM in use,
I'll sit up and listen, but I suspect you're talking about something
closer to 20MB and init S :>
These discussions are getting really unreasonable. "I don't want that
feature, therefore it shouldn't be merged" isn't a valid argument.
Neither is "Well, I can suspend in seven seconds with hardly any memory
in use." If you just don't want suspend2 in the kernel, come out and say
it. But please, stop giving me lame arguments (more below deleted rather
than replied to).
