You might want to note where you got these functions from in your message.
Also, it would be easier to follow these changes if you had broken things up
into two patches - one which moved stuff from ocfs2 into generic helpers and
a 2nd one to convert ext3.
Looking into my crystal ball, I see a bunch of "convert to using byteorder
math macros" patches coming down the pipe. Since we're talking about disk
fields where a mistake could be costly, I suggest that any patch more than a
couple of lines should be tested by the submitter with sparse. A statement
that sparse didn't produce any new warnings (with the patch applied) could
be included in the description.
