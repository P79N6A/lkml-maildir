With CONFIG_DEBUG_LOCK_ALLOC turned off i was getting sporadic
failures in the locking self-test:

         A-B-C-D-B-D-D-A deadlock:  ok  |  ok  |  ok  |  ok  |  ok  |  ok  |
         A-B-C-D-B-C-D-A deadlock:  ok  |  ok  |  ok  |  ok  |  ok  |FAILED|
after much debugging it turned out to be caused by accidental chain-hash
key collisions. The current hash is:
 #define iterate_chain_key(key1, key2) \
	(((key1) << MAX_LOCKDEP_KEYS_BITS/2) ^ \
	((key1) >> (64-MAX_LOCKDEP_KEYS_BITS/2)) ^ \
 	(key2))
where MAX_LOCKDEP_KEYS_BITS is 11. This hash is pretty good as it will
shift by 5 bits in every iteration, where every new ID 'mixed' into the
hash would have up to 11 bits. But because there was a 6 bits overlap
between subsequent IDs and their high bits tended to be similar, there
was a chance for accidental chain-hash collision for a low number of
locks held.
the solution is to shift by 11 bits:
 #define iterate_chain_key(key1, key2) \
	(((key1) << MAX_LOCKDEP_KEYS_BITS) ^ \
	((key1) >> (64-MAX_LOCKDEP_KEYS_BITS)) ^ \
 	(key2))
This keeps the hash perfect up to 5 locks held, but even above that the
hash is still good because 11 bits is a relative prime to the total 64
bits, so a complete match will only occur after 64 held locks (which
doesnt happen in Linux). Even after 5 locks held, entropy of the 5 IDs
mixed into the hash is already good enough so that overlap doesnt
generate a colliding hash ID.
which this change the false positives went away.
