    Hi Pavel :)

    I'm not a lawyer, and I'm not a GPL-expert, neither, but AFAIK,
if you use GPL code in your project, your code becomes GPLd too.
    If you use ide-cd driver (or even a part of it), since it is GPL,
the code that uses it is GPL too. If Aros is not going to distribute
such source code, then Aros is not allowed to use GPL code.
    Ask FSF for details.
