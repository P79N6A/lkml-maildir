Yes, I implemented this, even.  The problem is that the desired module
semantics are "unload if it'll work, otherwise do nothing and fail".
This means that you either get halfway through the cleanup function
and back out (which leaves the race where some interfaces to your
module is MIA for a while), or you hang forever if things are in use.
It's this "atomically check refcount and deregister" that
try_module_get() gives us, by effectively unregistering all the
modules' interfaces at once.
Rusty.
