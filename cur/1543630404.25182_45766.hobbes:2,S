The real problem appears to be cpqarray.c, it wraps the init/exit code
in #ifdef MODULE, so the init code is only available to modules.  I
think that cpqarray.c should remove the #ifdef MODULE and use the same
init mechanism as other drivers, including module_init/exit.  I don't
have a card and the code is a mess so I am not going to attempt a patch.
