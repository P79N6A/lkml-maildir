Unlike other BIOS, this cannot be fixed up and I don't believe there is an easy way to identify every single "version" of this machine (Stephen Rothwell, can you comment here?).
That broken call is a major part of the Linux APM system.  The simplest (and arguably, best) solution is to just not compile it into the kernel or add "apm=off" to lilo.conf until the problem is fixed.

I do not believe so.  I tend to think that detecting these broken models is a waste of kernel code (especially, if there's an effort to correct the problem).

This is what we have been led to believe.  I have no ETA at this time.
