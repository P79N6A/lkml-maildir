I ran into the same compile errors in drivers/scsi/sr_ioctl.c.
If I turn off CONFIG_BLK_DEV_SR, then it builds ok.
Just guessing, the problem is likely in the bk-scsi.patch, which seems
to be signed off by James Bottomley, and handled by or originated from
Markus Lidel and various others.  This is the only patch in Andrew's
2.6.7-rc2-mm1 that touches files matching drivers/scsi/sr*.
So I am adding him to the cc list.
