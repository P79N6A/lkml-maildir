Just to avoid a false impression: I am in no way against debian project nor do
I say there is anything specifically bad about it. I am generally disliking
distros' ideas of having _own_ kernels. Commercial companies like SuSE or Red
Hat may find arguments for that which are commercially backed, debian on the
other hand can hardly argue commercially. From the community point of view it
is just nonsense. It means more work and less useable feedback.
Bugs is distro kernels are (always) the sole fault of their respective
maintainers because they actively decided _not_ to follow the mainstream and
made bogus patches. Why waste the appreciated work of (unpaid) debian
volunteers in this area? There are tons of other work left with far more
relevance for users than bleeding edge kernel patches...
And if you really insist to pick up the tough pieces around kernel then find
out why 2.4.20 is the last stable netfilter implementation... for sure far more
relevant than loadable module ide code in 2.6.0-testX.
Regards,
Stephan
