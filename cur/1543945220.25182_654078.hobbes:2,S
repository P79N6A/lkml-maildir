Hi Adrian,

One of the things on my plate is to get the -mno-mem-funcs patch 
contributed upstream.  (Along with a lot of other pending AM33 patches, 
such as the support for the AM34 processor).  As it happens MEI have 
just opened an issue with regard to -mno-mem-funcs, so any pushing of 
the patch will have to wait until that is resolved.
Cheers
   Nick
