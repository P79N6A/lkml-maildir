on ext3 in default mode it works a bit different
if you write a NEW file that is
then first the data gets written (within like 5 seconds, and not waiting
for the lazy flush daemon). Only when that is done is the metadata (eg
filesize on disk) updated. So after the power comes back you don't see a
mixed thing; you see a file of a certain size, and all the data upto
that size is there.
If you need more guarantees you need to use fsync/fdata_sync from the
application.
