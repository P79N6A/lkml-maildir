From what I can see (checking both mainline and Tony's tree), this mpu
alias (virtual_ck_mpu) is not used on OMAP1, which seems to suggest
that this quirk has become redundant.  If it is redundant, it should
be removed.
If there is some code somewhere to use it, this quirk should live with
the user of the quirk until such time that the user becomes ready to be
merged.
