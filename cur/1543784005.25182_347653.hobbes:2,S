Subject: [-mm patch 0/5] SharpSL: Prepare drivers and add new ARM PXA machines Spitz and Borzoi

Sharp's newer range of Zaurus clamshell handhelds, the cxx00's are
similar to the c7x0 series yet different. This patch series abstracts
the differences and generates a set of common drivers that support both
series of devices. It then adds machine support for Spitz (SL-C3000) and
Borzoi (SL-C3100). Hooks for Akita (SL-C1000) differences are also
added. The I2C driver for its IO expander is the only missing piece.
This series of patches is heavily based on the corgi patches already in
-mm so its being submitted to Andrew. The patches have been mentioned on
linux-arm-kernel and no objections were raised.
I hope to follow this series with a spitz keyboard driver (the only
driver not shared with the c7x0) and a battery+power management driver
for both corgi and spitz models within a few days.
USB Host and MTD support for Spitz are being dealt with through the
subsystem maintainers.
