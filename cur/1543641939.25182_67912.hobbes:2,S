There is nothing really to hectic that is using NAT as most of the traffic goes via a proxy. I'd say the only things that use NAT would be services that dont support an http proxy, kazaa,edonkey,SMTP,pop.
The following ports are NAT'ed 25 22 80 (not really used) 9034 59651 4661 4662
This is the NAT part the gateway config:
$IPTABLES -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o $WAN -j MASQUERADE
$IPTABLES -A FORWARD -i $LAN -j ACCEPT
$IPTABLES -A FORWARD -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
$IPTABLES -A FORWARD -m limit --limit 3/minute --limit-burst 3 -j LOG --log-level DEBUG --log-prefix "IPT FORWARD packet died: "
Traffic is pretty low in general. If there is any other information i can give you please let me know.
