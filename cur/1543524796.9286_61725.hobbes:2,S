Hello all--
Thanks mainly to the reminders from Thomas :) I have exported my slides
from Linux Expo in Paris, from a talk entitled "Writing Portable Device
Drivers for Linux Kernel 2.4.0", and put it up on my driver's page:
http://gtf.org/garzik/drivers/
The link directly to the slides is
http://gtf.org/garzik/drivers/LinuxExpo2000_Paris/
Even if you are familiar with the new device driver facilities in 2.3.42
kernels, this should provide a handy reference to hacking device
drivers.
Questions and comments welcome.
	Jeff
