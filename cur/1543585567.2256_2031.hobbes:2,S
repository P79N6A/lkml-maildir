Hi,
Also as a note, what we are doing is keeping our rootfs on flash as a tar.gz and 
reading it and mounting it on a ramfs in the /linuxrc before doing a pivot_root. 
To summarize, pivot_root has been a life saver as the earlier real_root_dev 
might not have been useful in this case.
Not using the ramfs limits for now, will do soon.
Thanks
Amit
