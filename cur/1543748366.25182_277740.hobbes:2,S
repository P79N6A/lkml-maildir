OK dumb question. I am going out to get my own personal brown paper bag, 
since I seem to be wearing it so often. I forgot tasks get removed from 
the runqueue when they are sleeping, etc. so the active array should 
empty most of the time. However, with more RT tasks and interactive 
tasks being thrown back into the active queue I could see this POSSIBLY 
occasionally starving a few processes???
