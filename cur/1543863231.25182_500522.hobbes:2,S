Nope, transfer rates were initially 1000-based: 9.6 kbps = 9600 bps,
28.8 kbps = 28800 bps, 64 kbps = 64000 bps. Then it went 128, 256,
512 kbps = 512000 bps and 1 Mbps = 2 * 512 kbps = 1024000 bps.
But it's limited mostly to serial interfaces. Other networks use
10, 1000 etc. because they have nothing natural in (powers of) 2
so 1 Mbps may be 1000000 bps as well.

1024 etc. is (should be) natural to disks because the sector size
is 512 B, 2048 B or something like that.
