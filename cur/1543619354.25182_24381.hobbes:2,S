Memory overhead due to allocator overhead is of no concern with the
slab allocator. What matters most is probably the overhead of the
radix tree nodes themselves, compared to the two pointers in struct
page with the hash table approach. rat-4 variant ought to have less
overhead compared to rat-7 at the expense of deeper/higher tree. I
have no figures for the actual memory usage though. For small files it
should be negligible, i.e. one radix tree node, 68 or 516 bytes for
rat-4 or rat-7, for a file of size up to 65536 or 524288 bytes.  The
worst case would be very large file with a few cached pages with
offsets uniformly distributed across the whole file, that is having
deep tree with only one page hanging off each leaf node.
