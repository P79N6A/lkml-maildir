I'm still up, a bit over 24 hours now. :)  Free memory is slowly going 
away, I ran mozilla for a while which got rid of about 60 megs, and 
now I see I'm down to 23 free, whereas at the 11 hour up marker I had 
nearly 130 megs free yet.  I've got to go to town, so that will leave 
seti and kmail doing their thing till I get back.  If it goes down, 
hopefully it will record something, unlike the last couple of times.
