Don't touch the Motorola 56xxx DSP, then. There are several
"insane instructions" that will smoke the device (programming
a pin for both input and output at the same time). There are
many other chips, often used on Motherboards, that have
programmable pins (even the AMD SC520)... These can be destroyed
by software.
Also, the bits for setting the power supply voltages to be
applied to your CPU are available in I/O space on many motherboards.
Try your 2.5 volt CPU on 5.0 volts. It will melt the solder that
holds the socket to the board!
Cheers,
