Exactly.  Put it another way, randomizer is a stress-tester.  Which is
a damn useful debugging tool in its own right.  *However*, the main thing
about debugging tools is that you need to be able to turn them on and off
individually; then you get a useful information narrowing the diagnosis
down.  If you can't do that, you lose.
	Folks, the real question is whether we consider the loops blindly
shooting down the file descriptors as a supportable thing.  Correction:
whether the code written in that style *and* *correct* *with* *current*
*semantics* is sufficiently numerous and hard to notice that we need that
sort of kludges.  Because what Uli's suggesting is certainly that - a kludge
sufficient for glibc internal needs.
Note that
#define NR_FILES <some constant>
for (i = 0; i < NR_FILES; i++)
	close(i);
is simply broken.  No ifs, no buts, it's broken on the current kernel.  So
that kind of stuff needs fixing anyway; do we have enough left to make it
worth preserving?
I don't know the answer; some data would be much appreciated.  If the broken
stuff like above outnumbers the valid uses, we probably need think of some
way to catch that kind of crap anyway...  Randomizer for open() et.al.
switchable on per-process basis would be a nice tool to catch some of those,
along with instrumenting the kernel to notice massive close() on files that
hadn't been opened, etc.
As long as all we have is a handwaving about widespread and unspecified
code doing this, this and that, but not that...
