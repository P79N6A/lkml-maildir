For a simple "is_smp" kind of flag, I would tend to agree with the
above... for more complex NUMA topology and/or cache characteristics,
which is quite a bigger amount of information, I'm not sure it's worth
copying all of that data on every process exec (and making the initial
AT_ parsing slower). Especially since very few processes actually care
about those.
