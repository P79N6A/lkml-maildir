The jack_test3.2 is basically a multiprocess realtime audio test.  A
fair amount of computation, signifcant task switch overhead, but
most I/O is to the sound card.
There's some disk activity starting clients and probably some other
system activity in the background.

Interesting. Worth a try to verify.  Con was seeing a 6msec delay
every 20 seconds.  This was devastating to the test, which tries to
run a full realtime audio cycle every 1.45msec.
