The decision is not that obvious - your patch's main use of
timerfd_ctx.lock is to provide locking for wqh - ie: to duplicate the
function of the existing lock which is there for that purpose.
So I think it's a legitimate optimisation to borrow it.

Look at it from the point of view of someone who knows kernel code but does
not specifically know this subsystem.  That describes the great majority of
people who will be reading your code.

To some extent, yes - there's a lot of material which is relevant to a
complex system call like this which isn't appropriate to code comments.
But a descrition of the role of texp.tv64 in here is an aid to
understanding the implementation and hence is appropriate and needed.

A basic description of the inputs, outputs and return value is appropriate
to most high-level kernel funtions.  One here won't hurt.

Patch headers are not maintainable.
Nobody wants to have to go off and waddle though the git repo to understand
the design intent behind each function.
Look, I'm just providing feedback as an experienced kernel developer who is
reading your code for the first time.  I had questions, and I saw things
which I felt were not adequately communicated.  You are the last person who
can judge what is obvious and what is not, because you already understand
it!
I do err on the make-it-easy-for-them side, but that's not a bad thing, I
think.  Very large numbers of people read core kernel code and the actual
change rate of this code will be low.  So we can afford to put the effort
into making these peoples' code-reading as productive as we can.
