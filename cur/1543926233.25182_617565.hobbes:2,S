This is more complex than necessary, this should be enough:
	sym = sym_find(symname);
	if (sym)
		sym_set_string_value(sym, p);
This is not a direct user interface, so the potential stricter error 
checking is not really needed.
In general I think it's problematic that this is only checked, when the 
config system is called, i.e. with a configured kernel adding ARCH would 
have no effect, what makes this more confusing is that one can later omit 
the ARCH variable, since it's saved in the .config. I think it would be 
better to check for this directly in the Makefile and then use a separate 
tool to set the variable directly (which could be simply sed or a simple 
helper program).
bye, Roman
