Hi Karsten et al.
Seeing the work Jeff puts into ISDN I was wondering what are the
state of mISDN. Will we soon see mISDN hit the tree or has
development stalled?
I was wondering if Jeff should go for the much simpler patch:
diff --git a/drivers/isdn/Kconfig b/drivers/isdn/Kconfig
index 66f946a..e904e9e 100644
--- a/drivers/isdn/Kconfig
+++ b/drivers/isdn/Kconfig
@@ -4,6 +4,7 @@
 menuconfig ISDN
        tristate "ISDN support"
+       depends on BROKEN
        depends on NET
        depends on !S390
        ---help---
Especially considering the minimal feedback from the isdn
community and the existence of a total? replacement.
