The RH7.3 remnant 2.96 seems to work for me on my expendable test box, 
and I don't really have space for an upgrade. I haven't seen any 
problems, other than old systems being dog slow. And gcc3 is even slower 
it seems, although my machines running that have enough CPU to pretty 
much overpower the bloat.

I have no problems with making 4k the default, but I'd really like the 
option of going back to 8k when I see problems, just to eliminate that 
as a possible cause of hangs or other instances of evil.
Is everyone claiming that everything in the kernel is 4k safe now? Or is 
"stable" total fiction? The 8k code doesn't take up that much space, it 
is well tested, and if you make 4k the default most people will try it 
with 4k anyway.
