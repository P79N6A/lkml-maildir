George,
Very nice to see this going in (via) the RT patch.
Can we get a real help text here:
Clock & Timer Selection
> 1. Legacy Timer Support (LEGACY_TIMER) (NEW)
  2. HPET Timer Support (HPET_TIMER)
  3. High Resolution Timer Support (HIGH_RES_TIMERS) (NEW)
choice[1-3?]: ?
You may have either HPET, High Resolution, or Legacy timer support.
This would be a great place to put some of your extensive docs about the
various timer sources and issues on x86.  I have always thought the HRT
docs were the best source on the net for this info, and I refer people
to it whenever someone has a question about timers on the linux audio
lists.
The docs for "High Resolution Timer clock source" are great.
Can we get more docs here:
HRT Softirg dynamic priority adjustment (HIGH_RES_TIMERS_DYN_PRIO) 
        ^^^ typo
[N/y/?] (NEW) ?
This option enables the dynamic priority adjustment of the
high resolution timer soft interrupt
No point documenting this one if it's expected to go away though.
