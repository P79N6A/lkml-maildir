There is also a kernel.org bugzilla for this at
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=9669
For some reason my adds to this do not show up.
In both cases we have a 
k(z/m)alloc(sizeof(*pointer), ...)
that is for some reason failing. I guess what happens is that the function 
in which this occurs is too complex for gcc 3.2. Thus it stops constant 
folding the sizeof(*pointer) in the complex inline-if-cascade that SLAB 
needs to determine the cache and does not eliminate the 
__you_cannot_kmalloc_that_much branch().
SLUB in that case just puts a series of if comparisions in the code. This 
means compilation does not fail but a large amount of code is generated.
We could replace the __you_cannot_kmalloc_that_much() with a BUG() 
statement so we have the same effect in SLAB?
