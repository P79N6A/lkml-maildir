I actually had in mind a notification so customers would know it was 
there if they actually see a similar problem, and a way to get the fix 
if needed. Since a patch was posted, I assume that's it's not quite as 
unlikely as you seem to imply.
We have two copies of RHEL-3.0 in-house, and I have a budget line item 
to upgrade 38 servers from RH-8.0 this year. Since they are all SMP/SCSI 
I think my concern with this bug, and the bug notification process in 
general is germane. I don't want to apply fixes for problems I don't 
have, but I want to know what fixes are out there so if I have a similar 
problem I can apply the fix(es) which might be related before spending a 
lot of time chasing the problem.
