All of us get the CPU wrong. By using modules however I don't have to guess
the PCI devices. My system already did that. I just need the configurator
to hit M a lot and to work out which root devices are for the initrd.
The code for that exists

I suspect ISA is a dead loss - but again build all the modules, the user
system already has the right ones to load configured.
