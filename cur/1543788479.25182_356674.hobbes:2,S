I was recently disappointed to find that 2.4 kernels very slightly
edge out the latest 2.6 kernels in kernel compiling performance on
my dual Xeon, even when 2.6 has HZ set at 100.
So I spent a few days trying some different mm/ optimisations, and
managed to reduce total kernel residency (excluding idle time) by 7%
on that workload, and now manage to beat 2.4 by a good third of a
second.
Here's a diffprofile versus a plain 2.6.14-rc3 kernel:
        123   384.4% __get_zone_counts
         54     0.0% __page_set_anon_rmap

Depending on how much interest there is, I might keep a tree around
to collect performance improvements. If you have any more[*] I could
look at, please send them over. I'll eventually try to get things
merged.
* Not just for kbuild, or only mm related, but preferably something
   that I can easily measure on my little system.
Attached is a rollup against 2.6.14-rc3. I don't currently have any
webspace handy, so I can't host a broken-out tarball anywhere yet.
Sorry for the big attachment (actually most of it is Hugh's pagefault
scalability prep and my lockless pagecache prep that I'm working on
top of).
