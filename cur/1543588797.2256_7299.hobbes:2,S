On Intel there is a also bit to disable unprivileged RDTSC, IIRC. On PPC
the timebase is always available (but the old 601 needs spacial casing: it
uses different registers and does not count in binary :-().

Well, there may be work in this area, since x86-64 will not enter kernel
mode for gettimeofday() if I understand correctly what Andrea said. Linus
hinted once at exporting (kernel) code to user space.
Some data also will also need to be accessible but as long as you don't
guarantee compatibility on data layout, only AFAIU on interface for these
calls (it was not clear to me if it would be a fixed address forever or
dynamic linking with kernel exported symbols), it's not a problem.
Of course it will SIGSEGV instead of returning -EFAULT but this is a good
thing IMHO, nobody checks for -EFAULT from gettimeofday(). I think
that system calls should rather force SIGSEGV than return -EFAULT anyway,
to make syscalls indistinguishable from pure library calls.
