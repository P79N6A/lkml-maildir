in almost all cases where a bad EEPROM checksum is found on a board the vendor 
has changed settings in the EEPROM image without recalculating the checksum.

It's valid for every piece of network silicon that has an EEPROM ever made.

it's in the NIC itself. In your case, where you have 3 separate chips, there 
will be 3 different EEPROM images total.

all the more reason to suggest that Nokia is forgetting to update the checksums :)
