I don't know ;) maybe some high-end NUMA hardware has IOMMU and
zoning by memory address has no meaning.

how about changing this name to strict_zone_order and
if strict_zone_order = 1
	Node(0)'NORMAL -> Node(1)'Normal -> Node(0)'DMA
if strict_zone_order = 0
	Node(0)'NORMAL -> Node(0)'DMA -> Node(1)'NORMAL
If someone thinks of better name, please teach me.

Oh, I didn't know about CTL_UNNUMBERED. looks useful. I'll try.

Okay.
I'll wait for other replies and post updated one tomorrow.
