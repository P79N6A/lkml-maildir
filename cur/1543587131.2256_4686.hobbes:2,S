Justin:
Ya think very buggy? I checked seagate web page and 
unfortunately was unable to find any firmware updates
for the barracuda drives.
Curious tho that this has worked flawlessly for well over a 
year with all prior version of linux and win2000 as well.  
Also a few other folks seem to have similar problems with 
newer kernels. 
Do the newer drivers put a bigger demand on the drives that 
might start to uncover the problems previously not seen? 
I did find newer firmware for the adaptec 2940u2w card 
tho so perhaps I should upgrade that?
I will try turning off write cache - kernel config option right?
Will report back.
Thanks for your help - it sure would be nice to be able to
run with the newer kernels again!
Regards,
Gene/
