i'd say: "certainly", but best you find out by diff'ing the versions
and/or eventually put 2.6.8.1's tg3 driver in a 2.6.12-rc6 tree, compile,
hope it builds, then try again to connect.

i don't know what a "smtp fixup" would be, but does the disconnect happen
to other applications too?
if it really turns out to be a tg3 problem, maybe netdev@oss.sgi.com
should be Cc'ed.
