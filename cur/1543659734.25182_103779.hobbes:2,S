do_setlink() needs to do the opposite of registering a notifier --
it's changing an interface's address, so it needs to call the
netdev_chain with NETDEV_CHANGEADDR (just like the handler for
SIOCSIFHWADDR does).
If you prefer, I could add a call_netdevice_notifiers() to dev.c and
leave netdev_chain static.  Just let me know and I'll make a new
patch.
Thanks,
  Roland
