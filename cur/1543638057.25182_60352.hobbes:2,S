Indeed. This is unacceptable.
Especially as the standard types are total crap, and the u8 etc are a lot 
more readable. People should realize:
 - the "int" is superfluous. Of _course_ it's an integer. If it was a 
   floating point number, it would be fp16/fp32/fp64/fp80/whatever.
 - the "_t" is there only for namespace collisions, sane people can chose 
   to ignore it.
What do you have left after you have removed the crap? Yup. u8, u16, etc. 
And if you want to share with user space, there's the long-accepted 
namespace collision avoidance of prepending two underscores.
Fix it, Vojtech.
