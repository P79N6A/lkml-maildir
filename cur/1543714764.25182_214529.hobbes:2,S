Great you want to help here. So I've a system which is NFS root using a
3c940 gigabit onboard NIC on kernel 2.6.5 and which is dead fish in the
water somewhere in between 10 seconds and 5 minutes after boot using
NFS over UDP. The last thing I see are 3 or 4 messages of the type:
server 192.168.11.2 not responding, still trying
NFS seems to work better with 2.6.4 which unfortuntely has other nasty
bugs for me; currently I'm running 2.4.26 which works fine, over both
UDP  and TCP.
Preempt is off as are the NFS features which I do not trust yet (v4 and
direct IO). Attached is the config for your viewing pleasure.
Please tell me how I can help here and I'll certainly do it.
Servus,
       Daniel
