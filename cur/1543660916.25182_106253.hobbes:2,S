Hi..
It didn't help. :(
Though I had to change it some to get it to compile... hopefully I
didn't screw up. (I did this to avoid "invalid operators to binary +")
#define virt_addr(addr) *(volatile unsigned char *) __io_virt(addr)
and changed the isa_...(foo+bar); to isa_...(virt_addr(foo+bar));
The oops looks about the same.. so I guess the patch didn't do any
difference (even if it might be needed in the long run)...
Any more ideas? ;)
