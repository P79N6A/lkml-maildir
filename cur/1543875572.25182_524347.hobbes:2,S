Yes, I expect the backup problem is the major real-world hurt arising from
this bug.
But I expect we could adequately plug that problem at munmap()-time.  Or,
better, do_wp_page().  As I said - half-assed.
It's a question if whether the backup problem is the only thing which is hurting
in the real-world, or if people have other problems.
(In fact, what's wrong with doing it in do_wp_page()?  The timestamp could
be up to 30 seconds too early, but that's heaps better than what we have
now..)
