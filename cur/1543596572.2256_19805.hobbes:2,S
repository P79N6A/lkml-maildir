It's not ioctl() overhead, it's what has to be done in the driver to
get the information you request.
(1)	Stop the chip
(2)	Read the media interface using an awful SERIAL protocol in which
	you manipulate 3 bits using multiple instructions, to send
	or receive a single BIT (not BYTE) of data. You do the 8 times
	per byte.
(3)	Restart the chip.
You are lucky it doesn't take an hour. This garbage 1 bit interface,
in which hardware designers assumed that software was free, is an
example of the junk software engineers have to put up with.
This is, obviously, not designed to be accessed very often, just
any time somebody disconnects/reconnects the network wire. Don't
ioctl-it in a loop. You will lose most of the network packets.

    attributed to Microsoft. Once I realized that Ctrl-Alt-Del
    was handled in the BIOS, I found that there aren't any.
