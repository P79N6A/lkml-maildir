That does sound rather high.  You should compare the interrupt rate
with the packet rate from `ifconfig' or /proc/net/dev.
Normally, 3c59x will show approx three Tx packets per interrupt
and one Rx packet per interrupt.  It varies with workload, but
it tends to vary in the "good" direction - at higher packet
rates, we do more work in a single interrupt and the interrupt-per-packet
rate falls.
