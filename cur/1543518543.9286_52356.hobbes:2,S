there is one race here that is subtle: if a bottom-half is marked _while_
do_bottom_half is executing, then do_bottom_half might not notice this,
and we miss the event.
could you try making run_bottom_halves do something like this:
	while ((active = get_active_bhs()) {
		clear_active_bhs(active);
		...
	}
does this solve your problem?
