It's a bit quicker here:
vmm:/usr/src/25# mkswap /dev/hda6
Setting up swapspace version 1, size = 54031826 kB
vmm:/usr/src/25# time swapon /dev/hda6
swapon /dev/hda6  0.00s user 0.04s system 74% cpu 0.054 total

Nope.

Are you using a swapfile or a swap partition?
If it's a swapfile then perhaps the filesystem is being inefficient in its
bmap() function.  Which filesystem is it?
