Bu chance I stumbled upon the discussion of the Toshiba keyboard
controller problem in Kernel Traffic #47. Since I just recently wrote a
similar patch for this problem, I thought I should contribute my work in
case it may be useful.
I have experienced the problem with spurious keyboard repeats on the
Toshiba Tecra 8000 laptop. I wrote the patch below, which is similar to
the one by Andrei Pitis. One difference is that it uses get_fast_time()
to print out accurately the time interval between wrongly repeated scan
codes. I use a 20ms delay which is well below the 33ms minimum repeat
rate; all spurious repeats I have seen happened within less than 11ms. I
was wondering if the very long 200 ms interval that Andrei Pitis used is
really needed?
The patch is not of "production quality" yet, and I guess it does not
handle escaped key sequences etc. properly. Let me know if I should work
more on it or if anyone wants more information.
I am not subscribed to the list, so please CC any replies to
kristian.nielsen@risoe.dk.
