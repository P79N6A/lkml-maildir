That's actually a pretty good point. I end up releasing "sparse" only as a
BK archive, simply because I'm too lazy to care and there aren't enough
people involved (and those that _are_ involved do actually end up
re-exporting it as non-BK, but that doesn't invalidate your point).
I don't know what the solution to it might be - but I don't think the 
reason they are using BK is that they are trying to emulate "the great 
kernel project". I know it wasn't for me - it's just that once you get 
used to BK, there's no way you'll ever go back to CVS willingly.

I don't disagree, but I don't see a real way to solve it. As Larry will 
tell you, the technical problems are bigger than you imagine.  So a BK 
killer won't be coming any time soon, methinks.
