Hi,
I've been referred to this list from the linux-raid list.
I've been playing with a RAID system, trying to obtain best bandwidth
from it.
I've noticed that I consistently get better (read) numbers from kernel 2.6.8
than from later kernels.
For example, I get 135MB/s on 2.6.8, but I typically get ~90MB/s on later
kernels.
I'm using this :

to measure the iorate. I'm using the debian distribution. The h/w is a MegaRAID
320-2. The array I'm measuring is a RAID0 of 4 Fujitsu Max3073NC 15Krpm drives.
The later kernels I've been using are :
2.6.12-1-686-smp
2.6.14-2-686-smp
2.6.15-1-686-smp
The kernel which gives us the best results is :
2.6.8-2-386
(note that it's not an smp kernel)
I'm testing on an otherwise idle system.
Any ideas to why this might be? Any other advice/help?
Thanks!
Max.
