There's a known problem with NForce2 and NForce3 chipsets that affects
at least IDE interrupt handling, the effect being that the system hangs
if there's "too much" disk activity.  I've verified that this occurs
with 2.6.8.1, but haven't tried more recent snapshots.
The symptom is that the system hangs hard during boot.
A tolerable workaround appears to be to drop the IDE UDMA level down to
3 using hdparm.  If you're using a Fedora Core distro and edit /etc/
sysconfig/harddisks to do this, it gets set up early enough during boot
that the system rarely hangs.
I haven't had time to look into this deeper, but I did file a bug
against it: 
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3398
It should probably be owned by Jens, since it seems to be IDE-specific,
but Andi has it for now.
