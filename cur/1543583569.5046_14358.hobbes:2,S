is this what has broken misc devi registration on my machine? I have two
misc devices -- microcode and psaux -- now (ac8) I get none, /proc/misc is
empty. Also, on boot gpm generates an "oops" from gpm.c(968) saying
"/dev/mouse: No such device"
So, ac8 has two problems for me:
1. /proc/cpuinfo shows wrong info about bus (claims to be overclocked) --
I will get back to you with the info you requested shortly
2. misc device registration is broken.
