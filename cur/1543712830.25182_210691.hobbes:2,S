And it's a kludge, to work around dangling references to a CPU which has
gone away.

If we have to add any fastpath locking to cope with CPU removal or reboot
then it's time to make CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU dependent upon CONFIG_BROKEN.
yes, cpu_online_map should be viewed as a reference to the going-away CPU
for smp_call_function purposes.  However the CPU takedown code appears to
do the right thing: it removes the cpu from cpu_online_map first, then does
the stop_machine() thing which should ensure that all other CPUs have
completed any cross-CPU call which they were doing, yes?
