Yes, ioctl()s require userspace threads, but that's okay, because 
they're free for us, since we need a kernel thread for each vcpu.
On the other hand, a single device model thread polling the vcpus is 
guaranteed to be on the wrong physical cpu for half of the time 
(assuming 2 cpus and 2 vcpus), requiring IPIs and suspending a vcpu in 
order to run.

The timers aren't pretty (we use signals), yes.  But avoiding the extra 
thread is critical for performance IMO.

Ah, but scheduling a vcpu doesn't just block, it consumes the physical cpu.
All other uses of read() yield the cpu apart from setup and copying of 
the data.

Do not meddle in the internals of kernels, for they are subtle and quick to panic.
