Alan, et al,
For reasons I cannot fathom, I'm having a persistant problem booting
some bzImage kernels on a 486 (actually, AMD 5x86-133) box.  It's been
working fine for a week under variously-featured 2.2.2-ac7 images.  While
trying to nail down a periodic nfsd oops, I decided to build-in knfsd
rather than configure as a module.  The image ended up slightly larger
than its predecessor (~562k vs. 541k) and simply refuses to boot.
It announces "loading........", then dies with a CRC error.  I tried
starting it from DOS using loadlin - same problem.  The size itself can
hardly be an issue, as kernels for my pentium-class boxes run well over
560k. 
Any insights into what might be going on?  And, yes, I upgraded to the
latest and greatest binutils - no joy.
Steve
