True. Although for simplicity's sake I wasn't talking about the mapping 
tricks, this was just for writing/erasing flash chips without doing any 
paging - it you're mapping different chips into the same hole you need the 
same cache-flush tricks even for read-only chips.

As you wish. How about:
void memory_went_away_from_us(void);
 and
void memory_range_went_away_from_us(unsigned long start, unsigned long len);
Where 'start' is an ioremap cookie.

Indeed. That's eminently sane - it was just the nomenclature and the 
documentation which was less so.

Yeah - but x86 isn't a particularly interesting architecture in this
context. If you can't selectively flush a range, you'll probably find that
you haven't gained enough from being able to do burst reads to offset the
cost of the complete cache flushes.
