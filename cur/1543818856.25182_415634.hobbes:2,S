I tried adding cpu hogs and it gets extremely slow very soon but still doesn't 
stutter here.

When those 3 are running concurrently (without any other cpu hogs) gears is 
showing 317 fps.

I'm happy to try... but I doubt it. 10% difference over 10 tasks over 10 mins 
of tasks of that wake/sleep nature is pretty good IMO. I'll see if there's 
anywhere else I can make the cpu accounting any better. 
As an aside, note that sched_clock and nanosecond timing with TSC isn't 
actually used if you use the pm timer which undoes any high res accounting 
the cpu scheduler can do (I noticed this when playing with pm timer that 
sched_clock just returns jiffies resolution instead of real nanosecond res). 
This could undo any smoothness that good cpu accounting can do.
