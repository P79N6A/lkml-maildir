I'm not sure what your bind_mode patch includes, but I would like to start a
general discussion on the bind/unbind issue.
I appreciate the effort, and I agree that this feature is important.  However,
I would like to discuss a few issues.
1.) I don't think we should merge a patch that supports driver "unbind"
without also supporting driver "bind".
They're really very interelated, and we don't want to break userspace by
changing everything around when we discover a cleaner solution.
2.) I don't like having an "unbind" file.
This implies that we will have at least three seperate files controlling
driver binding when we really need only one or two at the most.  Consider
"bind", "unbind", and the link to the driver that is bound.
An Alternative Solution
=======================
Why not have a file named "bind".  We can write the name of the driver we want
bound to the device.  When we want to unbind the driver we could do something
like this:
# echo "" > bind
or
# echo 0 > bind
At least then we only have the link and the "bind" file to worry about.  I've
also been considering more inventive solutions (like deleting the symlink will
cause the driver to unbind).  But it could get complex very quickly.  Really,
we need to discuss this more.
I look forward to any comments.
Thanks,
Adam
