lzo compresses/decompresses much faster and using less cpu
this is how it compares:
bzip2:  best compression, but damn slow performance
gzip: good compression with good performance
lzo:  not that good compression but stunning performance 
reiser4 and compressed caching is alrady using lzo compression, but they bring their own implementation - there are other projects which could make use of it - so it`s better to share the code by making it an integral part of the kernel.

I'm certainly missing something but what are the advantages of this
code (over current gzip etc.), and what will be using it?
