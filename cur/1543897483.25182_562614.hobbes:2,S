It does. It means you can't charge for adminsitrative or other costs
associated with performing the source distribution. It's necessary because
otherwise someone could claim that it costs them $10,000 to give you the
source code because they need to purchase a license from someone else. This
limits what you can charge for but does not specify what you have to do.

It's obvious why it's there. If you're going to charge for the distribution,
the charge must be nominal and justified by actual distribution cost.
Note that even a distribution over the Internet must be physically performed
in this sense (actual physical activity by a human being is required to
perform this type of distribution, both in setup and in maintenance). I
would argue that the GPL allows you to charge these costs if you really
wanted to, though it's hard to imagine why anyone would bother.
