This misses the point. The proposed change would require me to make my
inodes writable by others in order to let them make hard links. That's
much worse than the problem you're concerned about.
If you run an ISP with shell accounts, and you're concerned about
users fouling up others' quotas, set up a simple shell script:
    foreach user
	find ~user ! -user $user -exec rm -f {} \;
Maybe even a mount option to prevent non-owner linking to inodes would
be acceptable (although I'm not convinced the "problem" is serious
enough to merit this). But the proposal I've been hearing is basically
a forced change for everyone, and that's not on.
