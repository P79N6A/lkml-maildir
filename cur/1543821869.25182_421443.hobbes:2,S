Did you read my earlier posts?
Users are seeing this *during boot*, before they've even pressed *ANY* keys.
They're seeing it after pressing a *single* key.
How on earth is "too many keys pressed" a useful message in this context?
Yes, maybe their keyboard is crap, but what is the user to do?
Go buy a new laptop because someone else has a utopian view on how hardware should be?

When a user can't do *anything* about it, it's useless, and serves
as nothing but a cause for concern. "Oh no, is my laptop dying?".
