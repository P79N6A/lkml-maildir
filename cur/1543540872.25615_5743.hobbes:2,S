Looks like a counter leak problem.  INIT_USER->user->processes
sometimes goes negative, the RLIMIT test uses unsigned int so the test
fails and init gets EAGAIN.  Suspect this line added to kmod.c
exec_usermodehelper() in 2.4.0-test6-pre4.  Quite often the old
current->user is INIT_USER.
                atomic_dec(&user->processes);
