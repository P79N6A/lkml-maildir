Sorry, bad choice of words.  From above, the VYSYCALL_BASE is known
at compile time (in asm-offsets.h).  So the SYSENTER_RETURN is still
fixed addr.  For execshield it's truly dynamic, so you get something
like this instead of the constant SYSENTER_RETURN:
-	pushl $SYSENTER_RETURN
+	pushl (TI_sysenter_return-THREAD_SIZE+8+4*4)(%esp)
