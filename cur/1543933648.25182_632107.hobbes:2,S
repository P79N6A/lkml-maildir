The root pcie port implementation is obviously buggy. But did we confirm
whether that hardware bug might be partly related to
"configuration-retry-status" pcie-root handling as introduced/described in:
http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=110541914926842&w=2
Does the 0001 vendor-id still shows up if pci_enable_crs() has never
been called?
Does anybody knows what was the original rational to call
pci_enable_crs() by default?
