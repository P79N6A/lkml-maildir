While I have no particular affection for the in-kernel boot loader,
I do care about being able to test new kernels with 'make bzdisk'
as a regular user, using raw (no file system) floppies.
Last time I checked, LILO required both a file system and root privs
(for FIBMAP). Would syslinux work better?
