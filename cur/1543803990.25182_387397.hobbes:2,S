so my question still is: _without_ the workaround patch, i.e. with 
vanilla -mm4, and DEBUG_MUTEXES=n, do you get a hang?
the reason for my question is that DEBUG_MUTEXES=y will e.g. enable 
interrupts - so buggy early bootup code which relies on interrupts being 
off might be surprised by it. The fact that you observed that it's 
somehow related to the timer interrupt seems to strengthen this 
suspicion. DEBUG_MUTEXES=n on the other hand should have no such 
interrupt-enabling effects.
[ if this indeed is the case then i'll add irqs_off() checks to
  DEBUG_MUTEXES=y, to ensure that the mutex APIs are never called with 
  interrupts disabled. ]
