   Oh. Even in 2.4 ?
Yes, the "cannot do VLAN" flag is there in 2.4.x
   That's a good idea. So vconfig could check, if its possible to
   create a VLAN on top of such a driver - and issue a message if
   not.
VLAN layer checks this and fails to bring up VLAN if
flag is set for the device being configured.  I'm way
ahead of you.
Franks a lot,
