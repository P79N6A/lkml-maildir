Like say /tmp. Build a bizarre behaving /tmp and I can do funky stuff
with some third party suid apps. Its a good start but you probably want
a stronger policy and one enforced by the user space side not kernel (eg
"Below ~")
> 2) enforce NOSUID mount options on user-mounts
2 is unneccessarily crude. Just enforce suid owner/owner group.
