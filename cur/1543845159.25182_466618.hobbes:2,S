Erm, forget this bug report.
- The long switching to console time seems to be duee to the xorg nv driver
- logging into X via gdm now fails under different kernels, too (though i 
still have no clue why)
- also in 2.6.17-rt8  i can run jack with rt even though no rt-lsm is loaded. 
This is the only really funky one, but i suspect there's some other mechanism 
that explains this.
Regarsd,
Flo
