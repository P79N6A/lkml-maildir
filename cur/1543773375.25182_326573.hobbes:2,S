Franky, one cannot predict which pages will get copied on
write since that is related to the behaviour of the process:
if the process writes, then the corresponding page gets copied.
If the vma has the VM_WRITE flag set, and the pte is read-only,
the page is a candidate to become subject to copy on write.
