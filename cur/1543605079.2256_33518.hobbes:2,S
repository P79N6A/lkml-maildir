I have a slightly more complex verson of this which does a whole printk,
and you can embed values, strings, etc. Same fundamental idea - ram
stuff directly into the video buffer. It's not pretty or portable, but then again,
it's for early debug only, so deal with it ;-) We really ought to make 
everything before console_init use early_printk, which would be #defined
to printk by default, and this on x86. Maybe. One day. Maybe ;-)
Disclaimer: I tried this on 2.4.12 the other day, and didn't get it working
in the 2 minutes I spent before guessing what the problem was. But it
worked beautifully on 2.4.0-test8, which was last time I used it. Should
work fine though .... it's pretty simple. It's not a patch style, it's a .c
file that I just #include whereever I'm working (because I'm an evil
dirty hacker). Feel free to make it prettier if anyone feels so inclined.
