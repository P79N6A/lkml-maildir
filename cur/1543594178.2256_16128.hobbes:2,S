I vaguely remember a distro shipping a kernel source tree without the
non-i386 arch directories. Looked like a good idea at first - saved a fair
chunk of disk space, and didn't break anything. Then you try applying a
patch, and get a truckload of errors... Easier just to keep the whole
thing together, IMO.
