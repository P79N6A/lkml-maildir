I think the inconstistancies are of the order of micro seconds and so will not 
really show.  Not all systems are connected to an NTP server.  One possibility 
is to build in an ntp like thing that averages out the PIT ticks and refines the 
TSC count per tick thing over a much longer period.  This would drive the errors 
way down into the noise and it still honors the notion of the PIT being the 
STANDARD for time.

Amen!
