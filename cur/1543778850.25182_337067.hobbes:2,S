From the OpenGL headers I can see the answer to my questions...
#define GL_RGB10                                0x8052
#define GL_RGB10_A2                          0x8059
OpenGL supports all of these:
#define GL_RGB10                                0x8052
#define GL_RGB12                                0x8053
#define GL_RGB16                                0x8054
#define GL_RGB10_A2                          0x8059
#define GL_RGBA12                               0x805A
#define GL_RGBA16                               0x805B
Are there 12 and 16 bit cmaps too?
