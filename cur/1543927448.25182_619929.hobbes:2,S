Look at the control flow. The __slab_free can never be done twice.

                freelist = __CPU_READ(c->freelist);
                barrier();
                if (unlikely(page != __CPU_READ(c->page) ||
                                        __CPU_READ(c->node) < 0)) {
                        __slab_free(s, page, x, addr);
                        break;
			^^^^^^^ no redo of the loop possible.
                }
