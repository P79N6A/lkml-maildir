I know this may sound kind of stupid, but how about not deprecating 
either, and fully supporting both sound systems? Maybe we can get them 
to work together, and the distro or user can choose whether they would 
like to use alsa or oss for that particular card (or have the distro 
choose the sound drivers that are best supported for that particular 
card). As it is now, most apps already support oss and alsa.
