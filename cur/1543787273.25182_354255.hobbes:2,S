For PATA the requirements I'm aware of are
-	Interface for user to say "am about to swap"
-	Interface for user to say "have swapped"
-	Must quiesce both master and slave before swap (or one per cable)
-	Must reset to PIO_SLOW and then recompute modes for both devices
becuse it is possible that changing one changes the other timings
-	The above is true for *unplug* too. A straight unplug may speed up the
other drive!
-	Post hotswap need to reconfigure both drives as if from scratch
