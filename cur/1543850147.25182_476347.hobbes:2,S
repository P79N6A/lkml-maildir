The problem (in my experience) isn't the threads but a timer that
submits I/O even when the threads are frozen. It stops when the bdev is
frozen. The last report I've seen was before I added bdev freezing to
suspend2, which was 2.6.14, so you guys may have fixed it since then.
I can seek to get a trace if you like.

Nigel
