I am working on a set top box using Linux.  The box has an Intergraphics
chipset that should be supported by the cyber2000fb driver that is
already included in recent kernels, but, alas, that driver is only
activated for NetWinder kernels.
Who wrote that driver?
The set top box is Cyrix MediaGX based, i.e. it is x86 architecture.
I am trying to port that driver and would like to request any help that
I can get on this.
