Your patch is correct.
The reason for the __native_read_tsc() / native_read_tsc() distinction is 
and obscure problem with paravirt function pointers. Such constructs:
  ./xen/enlighten.c:	.read_tsc = native_read_tsc,
do not always work fine with all versions of gcc, if native_read_tsc() is 
a simple static inline (as it should be) - the build would fail with 
certain gcc flags. (and i remember runtime problems too) The C semantics 
of taking the address of an inline function seem pretty clear: the inlined 
function should be instantiated in that .o and a pointer should be 
generated out of that local instantiation.
Perhaps the real fix is to do this rename as well:
    native_read_tsc => native_read_tsc_paravirt
  __native_read_tsc => native_read_tsc
as this makes the native_read_tsc_paravirt() a pure technical variant, to 
be used in paravirt_ops function pointer assignments. People would thus 
just use the obvious native_read_tsc() inline function most of the time 
and could forget about native_read_tsc_paravirt().
