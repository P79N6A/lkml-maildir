Thanks not to invalidate that the mirroring at the power of 3 is possible.

Given the smileys and other technologies involved, you should not have
missed that I was joking about the absurdity of brain-deaded complexities
and redundancies we have to deal nowadays in I.T. due to legacies. 
By the way, it happens that I ask me questions about 1990's software
technology being actually superior to 1970's one or just increase of
complexity.
