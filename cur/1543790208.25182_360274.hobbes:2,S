Yes, that's great.

You've got three of the "new" devres resources, and judging by the values, 
I'd guess you have an IBM ThinkPad 600 series machine. No?
If it's indeed an IBM ThinkPad, I don't need any more info. It's a 
confirmation of the behaviour that I already saw debugging Alan's machine.
I have no idea what that device at 0x15e8 actually _is_, but just the fact 
that the PCI resource management will know about it means that we now can 
avoid putting anything else at that address. Which is why we want to know 
about these quirks in the first place.
(The two other device resources are just old ISA areas, we'd never have 
put any PCI device in those ranges anyway. But the mysterious 0x15e8 
region was what got me started on this thing).
And if it's something else than a ThinkPad, I'd love to know what it is.
