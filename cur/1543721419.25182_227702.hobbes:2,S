Well, if you want deterministic interrupt latencies you should go for a realtime OS.
I know Linux is the big thing in the industry, but you're really better off looking
for a small Hard RT OS.  From the OpenSource world eCOS or RTEMS come to mind.  Or even
rtlinux/rtai if you want to run a full linux kernel as idle task.
