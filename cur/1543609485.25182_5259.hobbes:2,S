 - Andrey Savochkin/Andrew Morton: eepro100 config space save/restore over suspend 
	--snip--
My eepro100 mini-pci card on my laptop currently doesn't handle sleep/suspend very well
for me and needs a reboot to work again. mii-diag output gives wierd data such as
the MAC address set to ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff. Looking at the patch code, it seems that 
pci_save_state() and pci_restore_state(), among other things, implements this. 
Will this work with APM's suspend/sleep functions?
