Historical reasons. The first AMD NUMA systems indeed didn't have SRAT
and before ACPI 3.0 was released there were some concerns about the
Microsoft license of SRAT. So k8topology was implemented as a stopgap.
The long term plan is to get rid of it though once the ACPI code has been
proven completely stable.
