[Felix Marti] You're not at all addressing the fact that RDMA does solve
the memory BW problem and stateless offload doesn't. Apart from that, I
don't quite understand your argument with respect to the benefits of the
RDMA infrastructure; what benefits does the TSO infrastructure give the
non-TSO capable devices? Isn't the answer none and yet you added TSO
support?! I don't think that the argument is stateless _versus_ stateful
offload both have their advantages and disadvantages. Stateless offload
does help, i.e. TSO/LRO do improve performance in back-to-back
benchmarks. It seems me that _you_ claim that there is no benefit to
statefull offload and that is where we're disagreeing; there is benefit
and i.e. the much lower memory BW requirements is just one example, yet
an important one. We'll probably never agree but it seems to me that
we're asking only for small changes to the software stack and then we
can give the choice to the end users: they can opt for stateless offload
if it fits the performance needs or for statefull offload if their apps
require the extra boost in performance.
