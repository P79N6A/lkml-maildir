Hi all,
With all the latest kernels (at least since 2.4.0-test12)
I have had occasional problems with a PS/2 keyboard when
switching back and forth between X and text consoles.
In most cases the problem occurs when switching from X to
a text console, which renders the keyboard totally unusable.
Pressing any key results in ^W ^E and other garbage.
Sometimes pressing Ctrl fixes the problem, other times not
even SysRq works.
The kernel logs the following stuff:
keyboard: unrecognized scancode (70) - ignored
keyboard: unrecognized scancode (66) - ignored
keyboard: unknown scancode e0 71
keyboard: unknown scancode e0 70
and so forth. I cannot reliably reproduce it though.
Can someone enlighten me whether this is a keyboard problem,
X problem or something wrong with the kernel's console stuff?
-Udo.
