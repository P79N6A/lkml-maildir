i think the worst is over already and i'm reasonably sure that there are 
no more bugs in it - this _is_ a 1:1 patch after all, so in theory the 
worst side-effect should be build breakages due to include file 
spaghetti. The window for this particular breakage was just 256 commits, 
that's OK i think.
If you want less stress next time around you might want to consider 
pushing such patches via individual architectures, so that it can all be 
shaken out (and such build bugs are found quickly) and pushed via the 
architecture trees. (Even such a patch that changes the number of 
cross-arch function arguments and introduces a new type can be 
architectured in a way to make it per arch.)
