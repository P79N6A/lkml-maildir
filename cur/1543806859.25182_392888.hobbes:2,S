BTW, I patched my local 2.6.16-rc1 with that patch and I run off 
VMSPLIT_3G_OPT quite well without problems. (Well, VMware gets it wrong, as 
usual, but nothing that I could not solved.) Even though I do not even have 
1 G but just 768 ;-)
This sort of testing reminds me of Linus's 100->1000 Hz change
("I chose 1000 originally partly as a way to make sure that people that
    assumed HZ was 100 would get a swift kick in the pants.")
Could we also do that with VMSPLIT?
("Let's choose VMSPLIT_2G to make sure that i386-people that assumed
PAGE_OFFSET was 0xC0000000 would get...")

Maybe something like:
        config VMSPLIT_1G
                bool "1G/3G user/kernel split"
        config VMSPLIT_X
                bool "Manual split"
endchoice
config VMSPLIT_MANUAL
    depends on VMSPLIT_X
    hex
    default 0xC0000000
    prompt "Memory split address (must be aligned to 4096)"
And in include/asm/page.h:
	#ifdef CONFIG_VMSPLIT_MANUAL
	#define __PAGE_OFFSET ((unsigned long)CONFIG_VMSPLIT_MANUAL)
	#else
	#define __PAGE_OFFSET ((unsigned long)CONFIG_PAGE_OFFSET)
	#endif
Not perfect, but a start.
