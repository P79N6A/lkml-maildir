Right, that's why my original proposal was to do nothing for padding
(other than ensure the driver could adjust the length if it wanted to)
and to add an extra element always for draining, which the driver could
ignore.  It basically pushed the use paradigm onto the driver.
If we want the use paradigm shared between block and driver, then I
think the best approach is to keep all the bios the same (so not adjust
for padding), but do adjust in the blk_rq_map_sg().  That way we have
the padding and draining unwind information by comparing with the bio.
For passing on to the driver:  req->data_len still needs to be the input
(bio) lenght.  req->extra_len can record how much padding and draining
was added.  The completion length also needs to be in terms of the true
(bio) length.  Now, here's the subtlety.  Because of the way transfers
work, we expect the padded length not to contribute to overrun (because
it represents transfers that were successfully completed at the correct
length), but we *do* expect drain usage to be recorded as overrun.
However, if we keep the bios intact, we have all the information to make
this determination in the block layer at completion time, with the
expectation that the lower layers report the exact amount they
transferred.
