Scalability is not just NUMA machines by any stretch of the imagination.
It's 2x, 4x, 8x SMP as well.

We would never try to propose such a change, and never have. 
Name a scalability change that's hurt the performance of UP by 5%.
There isn't one.

It's a matter of repeatedly reimplementing a bunch of stuff in userspace,
instead of doing things in kernel space once, properly, with all the
machine specific knowledge that's needed. It's *so* much easier to
program over a single OS image.
