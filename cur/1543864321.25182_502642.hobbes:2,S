Subject: [PATCH] Add PA Semi PCI vendor id
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/1/29/16

Add PA Semi's PCI vendor ID (0x1959).
Signed-off-by: Olof Johansson <olof@lixom.net>
---
Submitting this separately -- several drivers that have recently been
posted could make use of it. I didn't want to include it in each of them
and have patch conflicts when they're combined upstream.
