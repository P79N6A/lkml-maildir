I sure remeber well since I was the one suggesting it ;). I now figured
out throwing some cpu at the problem would make them swappable without
hurting any fast path, so I was opting for it. It won't be an efficient
swapping but at least it swaps ;). If it will be way too inefficient
we've to options 1) is to take the 2.4 way of destroying all the vma
(still better than to destroy the whole address space), 2) to make the
mlocked as I originally suggested which will annoy the JIT emulation
usage mentioned.

Ok! I'm still late at this though, I wish I would be working on the
nonlinear stuff by now ;), I'm still stuck at the anon_vma_chain...
If I understand well, vmtruncate will also need the pagetable walker to
nuke all mappings of the last pages of the files before we free them
from the pagecache. So it should be a library call that mincore can use
too then, I don't see problems.
btw (for completeness), about the cpu consumption concerns about objrmap
w.r.t. security (that was Ingo's only argument against objrmap),
whatever malicious waste of cpu that could happen during paging, can be
already triggered in any kernel out there by using truncate on the same
mappings instead of swapping them out. Truncate 1 page at time and you
can have the kernel walk all the vmas in the huge list for every page in
the mapping. It must be mandated by a syscall but I don't see much
difference. I don't think it's very different from a for(;;) loop in
userspace, except this will have an higher scheduler latency, but if we
implement it right the scheduler latency won't be higher than the one
triggered by truncate today. So I can't see any security related issue.
Swapping a page with objrmap or truncating it with the same objrmap (as
every kernel out there does) carries exactly the same objrmap cpu cost.
And this is only a matter of local security and wasting cpu if you can
write your own app is quite easy anyways.
