Hmm --- this is not one I think I've ever seen before.

Well, that's a straight forward trace, and looks perfectly normal for
a delete operation.  The buffer_head is locked at this point, and the
transaction itself is pinned, so I can't see any way to have an
unrecognised transaction here.

Those problems included AGP cache coherency problems, but I didn't see
any mention of other instabilities as a result.  Also,

with this driver loaded we really can't make any guarantees about your
system stability at all.  If you manage to eliminate other oopses and
still get the ext3 one, even without the NVidia driver loaded, then
there would be a much better change of debugging things, but right now
it sounds like a hardware problem.
