	I think there's a continuum here. If, for example, the firmware in the
Linux kernel is identical to the firmware in the Windows driver and the
Linux kernel contains no special code to talk to this firmware (in other
words, the firmware makes this device look like every other similar device
and the kernel contains a generic driver), then the 'mere aggregation'
argument is persuasive. We have two independently derived works that happen
to be combined in a single file. They each happen to implement the same
interface from opposite sides, but they do so for different reasons and are
not specifically designed to work as a unit.
	On the flip side, if the Linux kernel code were developed just to talk to
this firmware and this firmware were developed just to make this device work
with Linux, then the 'mere aggregation' argument seems ludicrous. Each work
is specifically designed to work with the other, they aren't just combined
after the fact. The two had to have been developed together and each has
portions that only make sense in combination with the other.
	There are, of course, points in the middle of the continuum.
	I personally have no issues with the lack of the preferred form for the
purposes of making modifications. I don't find that fight worth fighting in
any case. I do, however, have major issues with use restrictions and
distribution restrictions. Code that cannot be freely used, reverse
engineered, modified, used on whatever hardware or with whatever software,
or distributed subject only to the GPL restrictions should not be integrated
into the Linux kernel. These restrictions cut to the heart of the very
freedoms the GPL is supposed to protect.
