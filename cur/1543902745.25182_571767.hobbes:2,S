Oh, come on, almost every kernel bug is a potential security issue.
IMHO, if the function can only fail due to a kernel bug, it should
return void and, in case of bug, explode with BUG_ON() or something
like that. Sure, must_check doesn't apply too well to void.
But, if I have functions which can fail for legitimate (not kernel
bug) reasons, and I know ignoring their return values would always
be a bug, then must_check seems an obvious best and simple defense
against that.
