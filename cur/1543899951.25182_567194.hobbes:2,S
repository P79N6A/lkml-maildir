Are you planning to move makedumpfile utility in kernel source three then
for this command to run? Output of "makedumpfile -g" is pretty non-standard
and very customized for filtering. At the same time, this will only work
if first kernel was compiled with debug info. (I think makedumpfile
retrieves all the structure member offset info from .debuginfo seciton).
I am still thinking that why can't we change initrd building process
(Be it mkinitrd or mkdumprd depending on distriution). Whole idea is
that while building an initrd/initramfs for the first kernel, one will
ask user for kdump kernel (if user wishes to load kdump kenrel through
initrd) and then it will generate kdump kenrel's initrd and pack into
first kernel's initrd.
So steps would look something like this.
- mkinitrd takes second kernel's vmlinux as argument
- mkinitrd runs "makedumpfile -g" on debug version of first kernel's vmlinux.
- mkinitrd generates the initramfs for kdump kernel and packs output
  of "makedumpfile -g" into that.
- mkinitrd packs statically linked kexec, kdump kernel vmlinux/bzImage,
  and kdump kernel initramfs into first kernel's initramfs.
This will save us from doing any changes to kernel build process and
also avoid any run time updation of vmlinux code. Exporting a particular
non-standard output through proc interfaces does not seem to be a very good
idea (/proc/kcore.info or /proc/vmcore.info)
Thanks
