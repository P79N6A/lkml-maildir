Could be. Especially on such a machine, it was the era of unreliable
memory busses between RAM, chipsets and CPUs, unreliable cache sticks,
unreliable RAM sticks, and unreliable voltage regulators causing
lockups and cache corruption. I don't think the problem is related to
low memory because you should get OOM messages if this was the case.
Have you tried running memtest on this machine ? I would bet that it
could find errors. I do still run a P133 which stayed up for 2 years
before the mains was cut, but I've encountered many of them showing
frequent lockups in the past, particularly on those with a small
cache card plugged into a special slot close to the CPU. You may try
to disable the cache in the BIOS, because I suspect that performance
is less of a problem for you on such a machine than reliability.
Slightly increasing the CPU voltage might also compensate for an aging
regulator.
Best regards,
Willy
