Nothing, I suppose. I just prefer directly using msecs. I understand
your point more now, I think. You are worried about those people that
actually use the return value of schedule_timeout().

So, I just spent a good hour looking at every caller of
schedule_timeout() which actually stores the return value. Beyond the
other wrappers for it (wait_event(), wait_for_completion(),
sys_nanosleep(), etc., which I will leave alone using schedule_timeout()
until I can change *their* parameters ;) ), I found two cases.
1) Sleep, see if you actually slept the whole time:
	remainder = schedule_timeout(some_value_in_jiffies);
	if (!remaining)
		report_timeout();
2) Sleep in a loop, keeping track of remaining timeout each iteration:
	while (timeout) {
		do_some_stuff();
		timeout = schedule_timeout(timeout);
		if (some_condition)
			break;
	}
Clearly, neither needs to use jiffies. The former only wants to know if
the full timeout elapsed. I didn't find anyone returning that stored
value (again, excepting wrapper interfaces) to the caller. They just
want to know if they should return -ETIME{,DOUT}. The latter just is a
means to guarantee the entire time is slept, but doesn't care about the
units.
Now, some of these might depend on structures which have members with
jiffy-unit values. But I will be more than happy to try and either leave
them alone or convert those structures. We'll see about that on a
case-by-case basis?
Thanks,
Nish
