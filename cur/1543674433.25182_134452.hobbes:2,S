You keep saying that, but suppose I want to try HW IRQ balancing using the TPR 
registers.  How could I do that from userspace?  And if I could, wouldn't the 
benefit of real time IRQ routing be lost?
It seems to me that only long term interrupt policy can be done from userland.  
Anything that does fast responses to fluctuating load must be inside the 
kernel.
At the moment we don't do any fast IRQ policy.  Even the original irq_balance 
only looked for idle CPUs after an interrupt was serviced.  However, suppose 
you had a P4 with hyperthreading turned on.  If an IRQ is to be delivered to 
the main thread but it is busy and its sibling is idle, why shouldn't we 
deliver the interrupt to the idle sibling?  They both share the same caches, 
etc, so cache warmth isn't a problem.
