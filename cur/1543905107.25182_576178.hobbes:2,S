Hi,
The Coverity checker points out (CID: 1500) that we can in some 
cases end up doing a double free of 'model' in asus_hotk_get_info().
I'm not 100% sure it is right, but better safe than sorry, 
especially since this is so simple to turn into a non-issue - simply 
set 'model' to NULL after the first kfree() and then the second 
kfree() is harmless (if it actually can happen, and if it cannot
happen then the cost is just a single extra assignment).
Here is the function with Coverity's annotations 
(proposed patch at the end of the mail)
...
1141 	/*
1142 	 * This function is used to initialize the hotk with right values. In this
1143 	 * method, we can make all the detection we want, and modify the hotk struct
1144 	 */

1153 		/*
1154 		 * Get DSDT headers early enough to allow for differentiating between 
1155 		 * models, but late enough to allow acpi_bus_register_driver() to fail 
1156 		 * before doing anything ACPI-specific. Should we encounter a machine,
1157 		 * which needs special handling (i.e. its hotkey device has a different
1158 		 * HID), this bit will be moved. A global variable asus_info contains
1159 		 * the DSDT header.
