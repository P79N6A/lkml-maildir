I don't ever want to plug anything I've written, but please see the
current issue of Linux Journal with an article explaining how this is
all working, why we are doing this, and how the hell we can keep sane
this way.  I've also got slides on my website from the talk I've given
about this topic at OLS, OSCON, and SUCON about this topic.
In about a month or so, I'll be able to put the linux journal article up
on the web for everyone to see, need to let the publication restriction
expire first...
thanks,
