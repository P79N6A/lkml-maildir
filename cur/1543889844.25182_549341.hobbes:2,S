Ummm ... you mean we're replacing all occurrences of ATTRIB_NORET
as well? Note that NORET_TYPE and ATTRIB_NORET are both defined
in the generic include/linux/linkage.h whereas __noreturn is in
compiler-gcc.h which is included only for gcc builds -- hence, my
preference for ATTRIB_NORET. Also, there is not even a single user of
__noreturn anywhere in the kernel code whereas ATTRIB_NORET is used
in all these places, which means it looks like to be the standard thing ...
Anyway, I'm fine either way.
Thanks,
Satyam
