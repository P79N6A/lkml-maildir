> So why store anything other than the effective container in the task?
Effective container is used for temporary context change, e.g. when 
processing interrupts and need to handle skb. it is effective container 
for this code. just like get_fs()/set_fs() works.
Original container pointer is used for external process identification, 
e.g. whether to show task in /proc in context of another task.
