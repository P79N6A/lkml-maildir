Hi Patrick.
(I'm all set now.  Someone kindly sent me a critical network patch via
email... :)
I'm not subscribed to lkml, but am following along in fa.kernel.linux.
I'm replying to my own mail to keep the thread somewhat intact...
Anyway, sam's .config can be found here:
http://depot.mtholyoke.edu:8080/tmp/sam-profile/sam-config-2.4.21
On sam, I just did:
1002# cat /proc/net/ip_conntrack > ip_conntrack
..and it wiped the machine out.  I can't ping it, ssh to it, nothing.  I
need to go walk over to the machine room...  :(
After lunch I'm stuck in meetings for awhile...
Thanks.
