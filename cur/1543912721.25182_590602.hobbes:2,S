The interrupt is *always* fired by the PVR - it is the VBLANK - ie
essentially screen refresh. It is *never* generated by the maple bus.
However, the maple bus is/can be hardware synced - which means once that
setting is made then the hardware will *always* be polled on the VBLANK.
In other words there is no need to check which device is interrupt is
for, because it is *always* going to be for both of them.
