Or, more likely, the earlier reports came from m/board vendors who 
upgraded their *base* BIOS version earlier than ABIT, or who simply 
have flakier designs which fail even under the older versions. 
Notice that the first change listed for 3R is "update BIOS code" 
which probably means the AWARD 'base' code which supports the actual 
chipset rather than Abit-specific features.
