Well, we are talking about using a different method to access the
extended config space only. This space is independent from the legacy
config space.
I don't see how mixing the old and new methods like this could lead to
any problem, we are not going to mix them to access the same registers.
But I agree with Andi about the possible dangerousness.
We need to improve this "mmconfig disabled" anyhow. Having the extended
config space unavailable on lots of machines is also far from a viable
solution :) If you still do not like this first proposal, what do you
think of my other one ? (having chipset-specific checks in
pci_mmcfg_init to find out for sure whether mmconfig will work)
Thanks,
Brice
