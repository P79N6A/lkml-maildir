FWIW, after reading this thread, I've slightly modified smartmontools so
that when smartctl prints the error log (-l error) it ALSO prints the LBA
at which a READ or WRITE command failed.
[Note that this is a 28-bit sector address.  If a disk is larger than 2^37
Bytes = 137 GB, then some LBAs can't be written in 28 bits, in which case
there won't be a summary error log entry.  If the disk is smaller than
2^37 Bytes then the failing LBA address should always be logged.]
This feature is in smartmontools releases AFTER 5.27, or from the
smartmontools CVS server.
In the case of Nico's disk the failed READ LBA address can be computed
from the error log registers at
http://schotteli.us/~nico/hd-problem.02/smartctl-a
:
  ER ST SC SN CL CH DH
  -- -- -- -- -- -- --
  40 51 01 32 bb 7e e0  Error: UNC
yielding:
  LBA = 0x007ebb32 (bits 0-3 of DH, CH, CL and SN)
which can be compared with the LBA of the first error in the self-test
log:
# 1  Extended offline    Completed: read failure       90%      1633
0x007ebb32
and with the LBA logged in SYSLOG:
hda: dma_intr: error=0x40 { UncorrectableError }, LBAsect=8305458,
sector=8305454
Since 8305458 = 0x7EBB32 it's a pretty open and shut case.
****************************************************************
Executive summary: smartmontools versions > 5.27 will print this:
  ER ST SC SN CL CH DH
  -- -- -- -- -- -- --
  40 51 01 32 bb 7e e0  Error: UNC at LBA = 0x007ebb32 = 8305458
rather than this:
  ER ST SC SN CL CH DH
  -- -- -- -- -- -- --
  40 51 01 32 bb 7e e0  Error: UNC
