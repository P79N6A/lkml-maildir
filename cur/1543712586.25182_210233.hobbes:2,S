No, but it has a mechanism (unfortunately I can't explain yet  how it works)
which amount to the same thing. In fact, the hardware can distinguish
between the case where a particular address in the child is supposed to
refer to the child, and the case where it's supposed to refer back into the
parent. This is a novel feature that is not supportd by the conventional
model. We expect to expose it through an API. For example a server can spawn
worker processes such that each worker has its own space (and is protected
from other workers) but can communicate with the server via data structures
in the server, where the new worker COW comes up with the back-references
already created. This gives the convenience of thread-workers with the
protection of process-workers using a mmap communication region, but without
the overhead of creating the region.
