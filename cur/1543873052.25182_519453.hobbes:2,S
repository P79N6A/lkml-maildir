Isn't defining these on i386 of at most historical value. The only consumer is
include/asm-generic/pgtable.h (ptep_clear_flush_{dirty,young}), and those are
already suppressed by __HAVE_ARCH_PTEP_CLEAR_{DIRTY,YOUNG}_FLUSH
being defined in include/asm-i386/pgtable.h. Or is there a particular need to
detect if other uses appear (in which case the comment accompanying their
definitions is pretty misleading)?
Thanks, Jan
