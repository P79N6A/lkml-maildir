I just got Linux 2.2.8 to work with my new USB mouse.  Details:
	Linus' Linux kernel 2.2.8, no custom patches
	Logitech OEM USB mouse, ``model M-UB48''
	Built-in USB on Intel 440LX chipset with UHCI driver
	Mouse plugged directly into motherboard connector
Made /dev/usbmouse with cd /dev; mknod usbmouse c 10 32.
Mouse used by gpm with following command (works simultaneously with
standard PS/2 mouse):
	gpm -3 -m /dev/psaux -r 15 -t imps2 -M -3 -m /dev/usbmouse -t ps2 -R
X11 is configured to use the /dev/gpmdata repeater.
Congratulations to Linus and the Linux USB team for getting this
working!  I look forward to getting my USB scanner working as well;
fortunately, it also has a SCSI interface :-)
Here's what the kernel logged at insmod usb-uhci time for anyone who
might be interested.  I've removed the timestamps as a waste of
bandwidth:
