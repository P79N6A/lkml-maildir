Is there any user demand for heirarchy right now?  I agree that we should 
design the API to allow heirarchy, but unless there is a current need for it 
I think we should not support actually creating heirarchies.  In addition to 
the reduction in code complexity, it will simplify the paradigm presented to 
the users.  I'm a firm believer in not giving users options they will never 
use.
