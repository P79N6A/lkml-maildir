: 	Whoah, that fixed it, very cool, many thanks.  Any idea what is going on
: with that, and if there perhaps is a better solution?  Again, many thanks!
I don't have any idea, no, but I've been conferring with Ingo Molnar
<mingo@chiara.csoma.elte.hu> and he's the one who finally helped me to get a 
post 2.3.19 kernel working.
It might still be one of those issues that they're working on a clean solution
to handle.
