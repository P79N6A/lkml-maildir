Will resend in about an hour.

It seems to work fine with Xen. A 32 bit kernel handles the 64 bit dump
just fine, my pre-kdump kernel is 32 bit but it doesn't have much to do
in this case I think.
I don't know about native. My gut feeling is that if the mechanism of
actually kexecing between 64 and 32 bit works then there is no problem
with the crash dump part of the equation.
The crash dump is pretty much opaque to the kernel -- it finds the
headers in memory and exports the relevant pieces via /proc/vmcore. The
crash kernel doesn't really care what those pieces are so long as they
constitute a valid ELF image.
My patch to kexec-tools-testing just changes e_machine to match the type
of the pre-crash system. The dump kernel pays no attention to this field
apart from the one sanity check which my patch from this thread
addresses.
>From userspace the contents of /proc/vmcore should be identical to what
you would see if you had done a 64->64 dump instead of a 64->32 one. I
don't think it is any different to copying /proc/vmcore to a different
system for analysis so any userspace tools should be able to cope.
