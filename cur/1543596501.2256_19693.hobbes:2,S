Why should it add overhead? Even the most naïve compiler ought to generate 
the same code, surely? I must admit I haven't looked hard at the output - 
it didn't even occur to me that it might produce suboptimal code.

Unfortunately, this being C means that you can't call them all by the same 
name. If I have to use unsigned_long_max(x,y) I'd rather type it out myself
