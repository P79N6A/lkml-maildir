You're welcome.

Yeah, it *seemed* innocent enough -- that's why I had to do a binary
search on the 2.6.11-mm3 "series" file in order to find it as the
culprit...

No. Reverting it from 2.6.12-rc2-mm1 (oops, I got the version number
wrong in my previous mail -- and that should also be 2.6.12-rc2 not
2.6.11-rc2) speeds up resume to the original speed, but suspend is still
ridiculously slow. Time to narrow things down again, I presume...

I kind of figured that from another LKML discussion but I wasn't 100%
sure that's what I should do.
