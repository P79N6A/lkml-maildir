That's not an argument; it applies to any proposed feature. And it's
largely a no-op because most vendors will turn all potentially useful
features on. So we still end up with 1K of unpageable memory in
approximately every kernel in the world.
We don't like to add things to the kernel that can be done
sufficiently well in userspace. Once it's in the kernel, it's
potentially stuck there for all of time because people may come to
depend on it.

Quite silly to have put that in the kernel when we could have done it
in userspace for 95 bytes, no? But now we're stuck with it for the
foreseeable future. I'd rather it -not- have any friends to keep it
company.

Sure it is, I'm quite explicitly saying that variant 1 is less safe
-in practical terms- than variant 4.
