Sorry for the horribly late response.  I've been without email since
shortly before you sent this.
I don't have a horribly serious problem with this patch, but I would
prefer that it not go in.
I really wanted to have a uniform, easily understood interface for each
of the firmware drivers which will do memory hotplug.  As far as I have
seen, they almost exclusively deal in physical addresses.
I just think that keeping the interfaces at u64 is a _clearer_
interface, although it does cost a few shifts in each implementation.  I
would have less of a problem with something like
__add_memory_pfn_range() that sits under add_memory() where and the
architectures only implement *it*.
