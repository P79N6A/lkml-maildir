Manfred and I have both reviewed the patch (or the 2.5.44 version)
and we both recommend it highly (well, let Manfred speak for himself).
I can't claim great expertise on IPC (never on msg, but some on shm and
sem), but (unless there's an error we've missed) there's no change to
IPC functionality here - it's an exercise in "self-evidently" better
locking (there used to be just one spinlock covering all e.g. sems),
with RCU to avoid the dirty cacheline bouncing in earlier version.
And I rarely exercise IPC paths, except when testing if I change
something: I do hope someone else can vouch for it in practice,
we believe Mingming has devised a fine patch here.
