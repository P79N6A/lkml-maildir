Hi folks,
I have a Goliath II SMP machine, with 4 PPro and 1GB RAM.  I tried to run the
latest kernel (2.4.0-test4) and I seem to run into a problem early in the boot.
This is what appears on my console:
Boot done.
ENABLING IO-APIC IRQs
...changing IO-APIC physical APIC ID to 2 ...<0>Kernel panic: APIC ID 2 already used
In idle task - not syncing
APIC error interrupt on CPU#0, should never happen.
... APIC ESR0: 00000000
... APIC ESR1: 00000040
... bit 6: Received Illegal Vector.
I'm booting from a floppy, in case it matters.
2.4.0-test1 shows the same problem.
Any words of wisdom, anyone ?  Let me know if further info is needed.
Thanks,
					Christian
