1. speed
2. portability
3. availability
4. familiarity
The most common language at present is C.
ADA tends to execute slow or requires a lot more resources to run fast
(and buffer overflows can still happen). ADA is also cumbersome to use,
think about trying to write an X server in ADA; it could be done, but I
wouldn't want to try.
Java has a speed problem, and is not easly written. It also cannot reach
some of the low-level interfaces that is needed for hardware access.
