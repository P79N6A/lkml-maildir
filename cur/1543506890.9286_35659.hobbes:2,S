Hi,
    I posted yesturday saying that I was having stability problems.
Since then the situation has improved. I didn't originally apply the TCP
memory leak patch because I wasn't experiencing a memory leakage and as
such thought that it (the bug) only caused memory leakage. Obviously it
had different manifestations/effects on my machine. Oh well, at least
now it's running smoothly:
[mastersj@periscope mastersj]$ uptime
  4:08am  up 12:10,  1 user,  load average: 1.67, 1.08, 0.58
much better.
