This is because your system is violating the PCI spec.  There is
now an explicit test for this during driver initialization so that
the driver doesn't unexpectedly fail later.  I can change the driver
so that it doesn't print out the diagnostic if it would make you
feel better. 8-)
Just out of curiosity, what MB/Chipset are you using?
