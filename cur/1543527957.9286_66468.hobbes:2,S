  Read LFS specification part 3.3
http://ftp.sas.com/standards/large.file/x_open.20Mar96.html
3.3 Accessing the Extensions to the SUS
  3.3.1 Compilation Environment - Visibility of Additions to the API
   Applications which define the macro _LARGEFILE_SOURCE to be 1 before
   inclusion of any header will enable at least the functionality
   described in 2.0 Changes to the Single UNIX Specification on
   implementations that support these features. Implementations that
   support these features will define _LFS_LARGEFILE to be 1 in
   <unistd.h>, as described in 3.1.2.12 <unistd.h>.
IF your  libc  and  includes  support kernel largefile stuff, then that is
all you need to do.  If they don't...  Sorry, there is nothing YOU can do.
The "try-lfs.c" program is one of those things created in a vacuum
which have magic knowledge about one particular patchset contained
values.  It is not a generic program example.
