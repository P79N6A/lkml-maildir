Subject: [GIT PATCH] USB suspend persistance for 2.6.25-rc5 git

A few -rc releases ago you asked about USB storage devices being
persistant across suspend/resume cycles.
Well, Alan Stern has put together a nice small set of patches that do
just this.  Here they are against your 2.6.26-rc5-git tree.
Now I know they are a new "feature" and it's way late in the release
cycle, but you were asking for this a while ago.  I've been beating on
it with my laptops and had no problems at all.
They have been in the past few -mm releases with no reported problems,
as well as the -next tree.
If you want to take them, or just play with them, please pull from:
	master.kernel.org:/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/usb-persist-2.6.git/
The full patches will be sent to the linux-usb and linux-kernel mailing
lists for everyone to see them.
thanks,
greg k-h
