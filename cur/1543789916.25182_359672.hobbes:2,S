I gave memtest86+ a shot, and after about 18 hours it came up with...
  Test:            8
  Pass:            7
  Failing Address: 00008072bf0 - 128.1MB
  Good:            00000000
  Bad:             00000100
  Err-Bits:        00000100
  Count:           1

3x1GB

And to track _that_ down I'll have to play "mix'n'match" with the
hardware.  Something that I can't do right now (financially, and,
time). :-(
Sounds like I'm just going to have to put up with it for the time
being.
Thanks anyway, Ken.
