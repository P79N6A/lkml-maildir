Subject: [PATCH 0/6] xattr consolidation v2
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The following patchset is a reworking of the xattr consolidation patches I
posted on 23/08.  They have been reworked taking into account feedback
from Christoph Hellwig and others.  Changes since then:
- Attach xattr handlers to the superblock.
- Remove xattr handler locking.
- Renamed consolidated xattr code from simple_ to generic_.
- Move generic code from libfs to xattr.c
- Use generic functions directly as inode op methods.
- Drop support for ramfs.
- Lots of resulting cleanup (e.g. remove handler registration etc.).
There was discussion of passing only inodes to inode op methods, but CIFS 
needs dentries, so that was not done.
This code has been quite well tested.
Please review and apply if ok.
- James
