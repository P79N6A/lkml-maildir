Maybe I missed the point, but I thought the 1:1 mapping between NPTL
threads and kernel threads is one of the advantages of NPTL and the idea
of a userland scheduler is quite dead. 
So please let gettid do what man gettid assures:
gettid  returns the thread ID of the current process. This is equal to
the process ID (as returned by getpid(2)), unless the process is  part
of  a thread group (created by specifying the CLONE_THREAD flag to the
clone(2) system call). All processes in the same thread group have the
same PID, but each one has a unique TID.
