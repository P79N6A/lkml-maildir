Look, I've said it before, but perhaps you missed it:
LINT IS NOT A STANDARDS DOCUMENT. IT IS ONLY A PROGRAMMING AID.
I don't care what Lint has to say about anything; what I care about is 
what the standard says. The standard is what defines the
language. Lint has nothing to do with it.
But, since you seem to be in favor of using tools to decide things, I
decided to do a little test. We have a variety of different Unixes
here at CMU SCS, and I compiled and ran a short test program on each
one, using the vendor compiler. If you're right, and the behaviour
under discussion is a gcc bug, then the string "Richard is right!"
gets printed out. If not, "Richard is wrong!" gets printed out.

Hmm. Sure does happen on a lot of vendor compilers for a gcc bug,
doesn't it?
