I like the direction, but first of all please fix the coding style.
I would also prefer to move more of the search functionality into the
generic code, so it can be used by other front ends as well, otherwise a
lot of this had to be duplicated.
I think a filter function makes it maybe a bit to flexible, if a front
end wants to do some weird filtering, it can still access the symbol
data base directly. So what I have in mind is something like this:
struct symbol **sym_generic_search(const char *pattern, unsigned int flags);
This means the back end provides a basic search facility for the most
common search operations. The flags would specify what to search (e.g.
symbol name, help text, prompts) and how to do it.

If you use QButtonGroup::insert() you can assign id's to the indivual
buttons and then use selectedId to make this part simpler.
