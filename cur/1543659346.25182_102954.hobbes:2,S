Thanks; "notco" fixes the problem.  
I have several machines that reads the same files/directories, but
only one machine that writes to the directories.  Will that be OK?
(The reason I noticed this at all is that out PHP-based web servers
started generating much internal network traffic after the upgrade.
The PHP directories are NFS-mounted, and due to the number of PHP
library files opened by each web access, the NFS traffic was about 10
times as high as the HTTP traffic.  :-/)
