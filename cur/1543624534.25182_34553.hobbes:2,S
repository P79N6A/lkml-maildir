Yes, and now that I think about it, I was probably running with HZ=1024
too. Switched back to 2.4 due to problems with my wireless.

Egads. I never even bothered to look up the code generating that message.
That should be HZ/50 or HZ/10.
Tempting to propose making HZ=HZ*100 and doing jiffies+=100 to ferret out
any code that makes assumptions about what the units of HZ are.
