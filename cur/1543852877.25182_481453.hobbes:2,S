I could try 2.6.17...but currently I don't know how to reproduce the OOM 
condition - so I'd have to wait 24h until *something* happens and the 
OOM killer kicks in.

I think I'm more interested as to why the OOM killer seems to kill 
innocent apps at random. I can imagine that it's not easy for the kernel 
to tell which userland-application is using up too much memory. Hm, 
egrep -r "OOM|ut of memory" Documentation/    does not reveal much :(
Thanks,
Christian.
