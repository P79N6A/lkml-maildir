Two patches to fix two possibly Oopses in md/raid
Both are suitable for 2.6.17.
Both involve indexing off the end of the array, and only cause a
problem if the ends up hitting a non-mapped page.
The first only affects raid0 is fairly rare put possible circumstances.
The second can affect all users of bio_split: linear, raid0, raid10
Thanks to Don Dupuis for hitting these bugs!
