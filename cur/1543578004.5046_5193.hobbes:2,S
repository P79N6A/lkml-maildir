It still compiles and works just as well as it does without the patch. 
 Without the patch it says: 
warning: deprecated use of label at end of compound statement
My patches are basically telling the compiler to be quiet.  If you 
use egcs it won't give these warnings even if the code hasn't been 
patched.
