Subject: [tested PATCH] 2.5.2-pre7 advansys SCSI adapter driver
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

Changes were added in lk 2.5.2-pre7 to the advansys SCSI
adapter driver that let it compile. It would seem that
the author didn't have any appropriate hardware to check
the driver (since it dies almost immediately and takes
the machine with it).
This patch 
http://www.torque.net/sg/p/sg252p7.diff.gz
will hopefully make the advansys driver useful again.
It is not perfect but it:
  - runs on a Athlon UP box
  - runs on a dual Celeron SMP box
  - is running the machine that sent this post
I have been running variations of this patch for the last
3 weeks and it has been sent to Linus and the lkml before.
Perhaps those helpful people who send speculative fixes to
Linus could mark them clearly as "untested".
