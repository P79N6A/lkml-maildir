Hi Linus,
I am a muppet it would seem.  The patch on disk and the one in the email I 
sent have a one line difference which breaks compilation as I just found 
out when I pulled your tree and git showed up the mismatch...  I can only 
assume that that was caused by finger trouble when I inserted the patch 
into the email with pine and then scanned through it quickly paging up and 
down in pine to make sure it was the right patch.  )-:  Alternatively pine 
has started inserting random changes to my emails...  That's rather 
unlikely I know/hope!
Anyway below is the correction to the broken one line...
Hopefully I will manage to send it without breaking it, too!  /-;
Best regards,
	Anton
