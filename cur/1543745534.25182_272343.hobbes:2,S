You'll have some precompiled binaries causing trouble, while other
precompiled binaries will be killed while you want them to stay alife.
Sometimes you'll have the same binary (e.g. perl or java) running a
"notme"-task like watching the log for intrusion while at the same time
processing a very large image.
The best solution I can think of is attaching a kill priority (similar to
the nice value). Before killing, this value would be added to lg_2(memsize),
and the least desirable process would "win", even if it's sshd running wild.
For the trashing problem: I like the idea of sending a signal to stop the
process, but it should rather be a request to stop that can be caught by
the process. A SETI-like task could save its workset and free the memory
instead, a browser would discard it's memory cache and pause loading
Images for the sites etc.
