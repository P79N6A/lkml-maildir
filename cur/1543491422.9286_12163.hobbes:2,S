First of all thanks to those who have come to my aid. It's now about 3 hours
on from my initial cry for help and I think I understand.
To be honest I think this is turning out to be one of those things I didn't
_need_ to know about, but I'm feeling a whole lot better about it now that I
do. It's also made me aware of a few cross-platform issues which are always
good to know about.
Thanks
Paul
