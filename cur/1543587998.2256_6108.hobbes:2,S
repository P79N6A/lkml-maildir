hdparm has an option controlling door locking; try locking it manually
to see if the drive can even lock the door.  then try setting it
to match mounted/unmounted status of device;  maybe it defaults
to always unlocked for some reason.
hdparm -L 1 /dev/hdc
also try commenting out one of those fstab lines... may be confusing things.
it should work the way you have it - you say mount /mnt/fstype and
depending of fstype it picks the right line, but just for the sake of debugging
try loosing one temporarily.
Cheers
