Hi kernel list readers,
I have a question about the functionality of mmap(), vma->vm_ops functions and different
vma->vm_flags. Is there any documentation that describes these methods and how they should
work (i.e when should mmap() use remap_page_range and when is the vma->vm_ops->no_page
function called)
Any  help appreciated.
