Nothing happens on the inspiron 5000 (I don't have the other one handy 
right now). I tried reading from all the files in that directory,
including those in the boot subdirectory, and it worked fine. lspnp 
also works and its output makes sense.
This is with 2.4.10-ac4, obviously, since 2.4.9-ac16 doesn't boot.
