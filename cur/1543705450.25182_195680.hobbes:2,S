Now, I'm testing a VPD for Fujitsu InfiniBand HCA card.
The VPD requires no special SDK such as VAPI of Mellanox.
In order to do that, I made some changes locally on IBAL and COMPLIB layers
based on the change set 1.207. I still have some problems, but opensm and
ipoib are working on linux-2.6.1 environment.
Robert, if you could make Jarrie's modification public at bkbits.net,
I can test the modification for 2.6 kernel using Fujitsu HCA.
Meanwhile, Mellanox is not the only supplier of InfiniBand HCA.
Fujitsu, Japan, also has InfiniBand HCA card with an original LSI 
different from Tavor chip.
Thanks in advance,
Masanori
