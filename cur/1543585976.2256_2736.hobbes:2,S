Well my only real complaints are that 1) It was done silently.. 2) I could not override it 
w/o a code mod.  Both of which are contrary to what I am accustom to when using linux.

Agreed... If CF does some wierd stuff then you shouldn't make the ATA driver break any 
rules for it.. that wasn't what I was asking for.  Just some why's and perhaps a message 
that indicated what it was doing.
As for the laptops.. What laptops are you refering to?  Don't most of them have some sort 
of std laptop HD or an ibm microdrive thing.  CF is terribly expensive compared to 
mechanical HDs.

Perhaps I missed something.. but this won't work for my original case.  I have a CF as hda 
and I was trying to hook up a mechanical HD as the slave.  I specified hdb=c,h,s on the 
command line but it was ignored.
