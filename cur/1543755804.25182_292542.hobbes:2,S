You're absolutely right.  Ok, so we do need to change kfree_skb().
I believe even with the memory barrier, the atomic_read() optimization
is still worth it.  atomic ops on sparc64 take a minimum of 40 some odd
cycles on UltraSPARC-III and later, whereas the memory barrier will
take up a single cycle most of the time.
So it'll look something like:
	if (atomic_read(&skb->users) == 1)
		smb_rmb();
	else if (!atomic_dec_and_test(&skb->users))
		return;
	__kfree_skb(skb);
