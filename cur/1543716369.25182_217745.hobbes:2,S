It was already screwed up, and causing unnecessary support burdens
both on the community ("help! what does tainted mean") and vendors.
This thread and previous ones have shown ample evidence of that.
Let's deal with the root problem and fix the messages, as Rik van Riel
has suggested.
Most third-party module suppliers have been confronted with the same 
issue
and forced to work around it (in other imperfect and sometimes clumsy 
ways).
One of them redirects the messages to a separate file and appends
the following notice:

Not. We don't use a script to systematically load the modules,
because they are large and not always required, nor want to
interfere with the system's normal logging.
Manipulating printk settings or redirecting the superfluous
messages elsewhere are also ugly hacks, which can
potentially also divert/hide important messages.
