Why not use a class instead of a raw kobject?  Wouldn't a struct
class_device make things easier for you?  That would also put the stuff
into /sys/class/cryptoapi which I think makes a bit more sense than
/sys/cryptoapi.
Or how about just /sys/class/crypto ?
Other than that, I like this move, /proc/crypto isn't the best thing to
have in a proc filesystem :)
