This is getting bandied about rather frequently. I should make some
kind of attack on an implementation. The natural implementation is
to add one pte per contiguous and aligned group of PAGE_MMUCOUNT ptes
to the pte_chain and search the area surrounding any pte_chain element.
But the linear search you're pointing at is unnecessary to begin with.
Only the single nonlinear mappings' pte needs to be added to the
pte_chain there; one need only also scan the vma lists at reclaim-time.
This would also make page_convert_anon() a misnomer and SetPageAnon()
on nonlinearly-mapped file-backed pages a bug.
