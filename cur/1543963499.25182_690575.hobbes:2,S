Okay, now here is something...
I don't believe it is kosher for mmap() to behave differently if we 
called it once or called it twice.
Therefore, the proper behaviour in the case of a range that covers 
multiple types is to break it down into multiple requests each mapped 
with the appropriate type, as if mmap had been called separate on each 
subrange.  In the limiting case, yes, this does mean the subranges can 
be individual pages, but such an outcome is vanishingly improbable in 
practice.
