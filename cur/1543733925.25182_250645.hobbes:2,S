Alas, but
# hdparm /dev/hda
/dev/hda:
 multcount    = 16 (on)
 IO_support   =  1 (32-bit)
 unmaskirq    =  1 (on)
 using_dma    =  0 (off)
 keepsettings =  0 (off)
 readonly     =  0 (off)
 readahead    = 64 (on)
 geometry     = 58168/16/63, sectors = 58633344, start = 0
so I already have IRQ's unmasked. [this was during no DMA tests, I usually
run with DMA enabled]
I'll be commenting on the results of the no DMA tests shortly.
