Sorry I had to be more precise.
I'd like to (try to) replace current synchronous media change checks in 
supermount by mounting device on insert and releasing it on remove. For those 
cases when it makes sense of course, USB sticks in the first place.
But users are free to use any names or links for their device names i.e. they 
can do
ln -s sda /de/myflash
mount /dev/myflash
and on remove it is rather hard to match this name against DEVPATH. But I can 
save (major,minor) when mounting and use it to match mounted filesystem on 
remove.

Hmm ... probably I can just as well use device name (meaning genhd->disk_name) 
you are right.
Thank you
