Given the tirade against O_DIRECT on linux-kernel earlier this month,
it has me wondering about the validity of this entry.
Every time we've tried to deprecate this driver in Fedora/RHEL, we've
had enough people complain that we've ended up having to turn it back on.
(And I'm fairly sure other distros have been in the same position).
Some vendors seem way too attached to the older semantics than having
to rewrite their apps to use O_DIRECT, and unnecessarily breaking them
so that we can throw away a 306 line driver in the name of cleanliness
seems a bit gratuitous.
