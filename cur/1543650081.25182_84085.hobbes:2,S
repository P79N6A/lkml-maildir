Please don't. Do not create incompatible versions of the same filesystem
just because they were written on kernels compiled with different
configurations. Superblock flags might be OK, but what is the point then?
Better mount flags (mount with/without finegrained timestamps)?

IMVHO, keeping fields in filesystems' inodes for 36 years in the future is
daydreaming. Not even the filesystems in the just 11 year old Linux have
survived unscathed... and by '38 we'll probably be by ext8 or so, under
64-bit CPUs.
