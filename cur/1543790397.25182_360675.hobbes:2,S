You might try something like HPL or some other benchmark that validates
its results, I have found that if you have PCI parity errors, even
potentially
on cards that the benchmark should not be using, it will usually cause 
invalid results in the benchmark when it is ran over several days.
This is even worse if the benchmark is using an interconnect board with
a lot of its communication going across the board.

Search for bluesmoke, the original name.   It may be in the process
of being changed to EDAC.

If you have ECC ram, just the ECC monitoring is important enough
even without the PCI parity stuff working.
