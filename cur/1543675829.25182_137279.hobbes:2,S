mtdblock shouldn't actually be _using_ the vmalloc'd buffer for write
caching in production at all. Anyone using mtdblock in write mode for
production wants shooting.
Perhaps we could get away with allocating it only when the device is
opened for write? Even that's suboptimal since in 2.4, JFFS2 opens the
mtdblock device for write but doesn't actually _write_ to it; just gets
the appropriate MTD device and uses that directly.
