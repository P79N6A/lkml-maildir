I think above testcases are just run with normal I/O case.
Did you test the direct I/O test with this patch?
With metaclustering patch, I can't run 'fsstress' since it oops when direct I/O.
or is it dependent on other ext3 patches?
Since I tested it with latest kernel 2.6.24-rc3 instead of mm kernel.
Thank you,
Kyungmin Park
