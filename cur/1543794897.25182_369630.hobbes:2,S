OK. Have got quite a bit further in tracking this down and will now
log with Debian somehow.
It is definitely userspace but I don't know enough about that to say
whether it is udev (Debian rules) or something else.
I used git-bisect with 2.6.14 and 2.6.15-rc1 as start and end points.
In the end the patch which caused it to break was the final one - just
altering the Makefile with the version number. I've reverified as well
by going back to 2.6.15-rc1 and just altering it to 2.6.14 and the
problem (mousedev not loaded automatically and no /dev/input /mice)
disappears. I almost thought I'd made a mistake in my testing until I
manually altered that makefile!!
It is definitely not a kernel issue in my opinion.
