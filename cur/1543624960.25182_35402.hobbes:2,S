You can do that and it will take a while because you have to port forward
to each step.  Why not just patch it in at 1.157 and then pull again to
pull it all the way forward?
Anyway, to do what you asked, here's what I'd do:
	bk clone bk://linux.bkbits.net/linux-2.5
	bk clone -lr1.157 linux-2.5 2.5.2-pre11
	bk import -tpatch ....
	bk clone -lr1.158 linux-2.5 next
	bk pull 
	repeat
