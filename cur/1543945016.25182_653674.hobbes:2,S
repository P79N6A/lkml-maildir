And snprintf() is buggy, by the way.  It does not always seem to return
the correct character fill counts.  I've given up trying to use it here
for anything in kernelspace that *must* work.
Someday I'll go back and try to figure out where it's screwing up.
I think it is doing so in the cases where it runs out of space in the buffer.
