We don't get that far, unfortunately.  ext3's problem is that the data
journalling (and its consequent ordering requirements) mean that a bare
try_to_free_buffers() will always fail, because we're holding elevated
refcounts against the buffers.  This is why we added an a_op here.  To
give the fs a chance to strip its stuff off the page before
try_to_free_buffers() has its try.

Hum.   I did a quick test here.  cvs checkout of a kernel
tree with source and dest both on the same platter.  Using
ext2:
2.4.13: 	1:34
2.4.14-pre3:	1:28
2.4.14-pre5:	1:37
We need more silly bugs.
I'll poke at it a bit more.  One perennial problem which
we face is that there isn't, IMO, a good set of tests for tracking
changes in thoughput.  All the tools which are readily available
are good for stress testing and silly corner cases but they
don't seem to model real-world workloads well.
