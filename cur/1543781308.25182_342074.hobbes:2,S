Con,
	I am observing the reverse problem - my patch does not work in APIC
mode. I am thinking it has to do something with disabling PIT interrupts.
Have you enabled CONFIG_DYN_TICK_USE_APIC in my patch? What does
/sys/.../dyn_tick0/state show when my patch is working (in APIC mode for you)?
Can you disable CONFIG_DYN_TICK_USE_APIC with my patch and check if it
works? Also can you send me 'dmesg | grep APIC' (want to know if your
hardware has local APIC that is enabled by the kernel).
