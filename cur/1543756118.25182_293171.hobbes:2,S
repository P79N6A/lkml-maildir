This should fix the reported issue.  However, I'm not sure if it's
a good idea to stop all IP traffic when lo goes down.  We don't do
that for IPv4.
Besides, we'll still need to fix the rt6i_idev GC issue since the
same bug can occur when eth0 goes down and some appliation is holding
a dst to a local address route.  It can become a dead-lock if the
said application then invokes a syscall that takes the RTNL.
Cheers,
