This is something that can't be known without enough information from the 
person reporting the bug. From what you posted of the bugzilla entry it's 
unclear whether the reporter did post more than his simple description or 
not.
However, the point is well made and I, at least, agree. (whatever that may be 
worth - I've never managed to finish a patch for anything without seeing the 
equivalent show up here later)

Yep. Closing it with a comment of "broken hardware" is an incorrect response. 
Doubly or trebly so if the bugzilla entry didn't contain enough information 
to even determine whether the bug was in the driver or not.
