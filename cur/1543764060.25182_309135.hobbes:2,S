Why? The symbol is defined by the compiler itself.

Let's not flame, Linus Torvalds said "we support GCC 2.95.3, because the newer 
versions are worse compilers in most cases". One user complained, even 
because he uses Debian, and I cannot do less than make sure that we comply 
with the requirements we have choosen (compiling with that GCC).
Please let's not start a flame on this. Consider me as having no opinion on 
this except not wanting to break on purpose Debian users. If you want, submit 
a patch removing Gcc 2.95.3 from supported versions, and get ready to fight 
for it (and probably loose).
Also, that GCC has discovered some syscall table errors in UML - I sent a 
separate patch, which was a bit big sadly (in the reduced version, about 70 
lines + description).
