Hi all!
sysctl -a|grep source
net/ipv4/conf/eth2/accept_source_route = 1
net/ipv4/conf/eth1/accept_source_route = 1
net/ipv4/conf/eth0/accept_source_route = 1
net/ipv4/conf/lo/accept_source_route = 1
net/ipv4/conf/default/accept_source_route = 1
net/ipv4/conf/all/accept_source_route = 0
so does it mean, that source routed packets are all dropped in all
interfaces, or does it mean that all accepted?
Yes, I want to disable it, and some other parameters, too, so shall I set
all of them respectively to 0 or 'all' = 0 will do the task?
thanks!
linux 2.4.18
