Well.. kinda tar-copyable. This only holds true if you either a) tar up
the whole directory, or b) know the fork is there.
cp and similar still loose the fork, and it doesn't hide it from the user
if you want to move the file.. having a nice, well-defined interface for
this (along with a necessary stat() bit), would make things easier,
IM(V)HO.
[I know this is pretty much what you said, but I felt the expansion helped
 make the arguments for one particular method versus the other a little
 clearer :)]
