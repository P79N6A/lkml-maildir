The board is allowed 1.5GB using 3 x 512M.  I believe the 512M modules
must be double sided to work but I am not 100% sure of that.
It is also generally unstable if set to anything over PC100 memory speed
in my experience (my machine has the same board).  The memory speed
detection doesn't work properly.  I have found it perfectly stable when
set to PC100 in bios and using PC133 memory.  It seems to prefer having
the extra margin.
I have never personally had more than 2 x 256M on mine.
