It's not logical, but it tends to help because it's what's meant most
of the time. I don't know a single place in the kernel where you want
to test for (CONFIG_ARCH_S390 && !CONFIG_ARCH_S390X).
Rather than making everything depend on CONFIG_ARCH_THIS && CONFIG_ARCH_THAT,
I'd prefer if every driver depended on its bus type. With the new driver
model, every driver has a clearly defined bus type and driver class,
so it would be logical to have that driver option exactly when these two
are enabled. Of course, that probably means a huge amount of work but it 
helps avoid problems when a new architecture is added or an existing one
gets a new bus.
E.g., s390 used to have no support for SCSI, but with the zfcp driver
we enable drivers/scsi/Config.in, so now we get a lot of questions about
drivers that won't work. Enclosing the drivers in "CONFIG_ARCH_s390" != "y"
does help us, but it would still be wrong to do that for a Sparc kernel
that supports some of the PCI cards but not the ISA ones.
