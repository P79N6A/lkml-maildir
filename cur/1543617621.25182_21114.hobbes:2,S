You could also use `lsmod`. It uses query_module() which will return

if  lsmod >/dev/null ; then
    echo "Modules are supported"
else
   echo "Modules not supported"

    I was going to compile a list of innovations that could be
    attributed to Microsoft. Once I realized that Ctrl-Alt-Del
    was handled in the BIOS, I found that there aren't any.
