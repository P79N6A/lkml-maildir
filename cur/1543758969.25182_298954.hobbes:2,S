I agree with you.  And I think it definitely would.  A lot of people just 
go to ftp.kernel.org and get the latest full release (heck a lot of 
compile your own kernel scripts I have seen do that).  They never read 
LKML or related lists, they just try the latest released kernel.  You 
would catch that whole group of people by turning -rc into 2.6.ODD.
And not to forget companies where senior management will refuse to run -rc 
because its a beta and beta is not good enough for company use.
Its the same as with companies refusing to run 0.x software.  In the end 
the software developers usually end up doing a 1.x release just _so_ it 
gets run by those companies.
I think the .EVEN and .ODD proposal would work a lot better than -rc ever 
would/could.
Best regards,
