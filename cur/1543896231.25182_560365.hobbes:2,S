Hi Adrian,
The purpose of this infrastructure has never been a secret; it is a
piece taken from the Linux Kernel Markers. I proposed the first
implementation of markers in December 2006.
Please use the following link as a starting point to the thorough
discussion that has already been held on this matter.
First, a huge discussion thread back in November 2006, where the need
for a marker infrastructure has been recognized:

A good summary of my recent previous post on kerneltrap:
http://kerneltrap.org/node/8186
If you have new specific concerns to bring forward, I will be glad to
discuss them with you.
Regards,
Mathieu
