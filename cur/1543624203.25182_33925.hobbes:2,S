No because Microsoft implement the bloody standard in the first place. It
works very nicely in MS systems. It works ok in 2.4.18 except with a couple
of boxes that don't poke the drive from the APM layer (eg IBM PC110)

I've got a nice working 2.4 system thank you. I don't have time to rewrite
the IDE layer at the moment. The fact that every 2.5 I've tried either
crashed or corrupted my filesystems the moment I did anything load related
with it (eg cerberus) convinces me its not something I have time to even
consider yet.

Because its standards compliant. It wasnt written by a half clued wannabe
who has never read the manuals and can do nothing but call people who have
a "liar". And a standards compliant implementation does all the right power
management commands. Win 98 didnt quite get it right and you'll find one
of the updates addresses IDE problems. Ironically fixing the same flush
cache and shut down politely problem you plan to break in Linux

For the other reason - they are better written. But a driven can be both
well written and correct. Its quite apparently you don't care about "correct".
If your design is not rigorously following the standard (plus the usual
amount of vendor got it wrong slop) then bad things will occur.
I'm not arguing that Andre's code is good, or that it doesn't need
some serious redesign. I'm just suggesting it would be a good idea if whoever
wrote it new what the hell the were doing, or at least spent the time to
understand the ATA documentation and implement it.
Now contrary to your claim I do have an ibm microdrive, do you have the
ATA specs, have you ever read them ? I really doubt it.
