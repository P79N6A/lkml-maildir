Subject: How to enable LPSTRICT option (kernel 2.0.36 - printer driver)?

I have an Epson Stylus Color 600 and when using the irq mode to 
print, it is very slow. Polled mode is fast. I've heard that this can be 
corrected by enabling the LPSTRICT option when compiling the 
kernel 2.0.36.
How can I enable this option to compile the Kernel?
Please reply to the list and to my e-mail.
Thank you for your help...
