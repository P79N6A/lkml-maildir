First always write a full description of the problem and the rationale
of the change and a overview what it changes. Also please add Signed-off-by

These should be all in some include. Adding externs in C files is near
always wrong because it avoids cross file type checking.
Also the convention is to add _pfn to variables that are in PFNs,
otherwise it's full addresses.

This needs a comment. Also I would still prefer if it was allocated
only when suspend is actually attempted.

These should be in some include again.
I don't like it that you duplicated the function fully. Is that really 
needed?
