Since I'm getting more mail than I can handle easily, I need to restrict the

You're right.  Fixed.

I'm going to send around an opinion list to see if we should trim the list of
URLs a little.  I've gotten the same sorts of comments from a few people, so I
need a bit more input.  (Just what I need; more mail. =)

All done.  I can't believe the "wide...wide" slipped by me _twice_.  Another
reason to support peer review. =)

Wait, that's almost exactly the same as what I had originally. =)

And you (below) don't want me talking about everyone's pet projects? We need to
trim the fat somewhere, and this seems like the perfect place to start. =)

Something like that is in my new draft.  The three "support"s are now bugging
me.  What to do, what to do...
> No, that would be multiple computers (or non-PC non-Mac hardware).

Well, it depends on what you mean by a computer.  Some of the fastest
supercomputers in the world (like the IBM SP2) are message-passing machines, not
SMP.  No matter what anyone tells you, SMP doesn't scale incredibly well.  If you
have an easily parallelized algorithm, MP almost always scales better due to
hardware concerns.

Har, har... I agree, but this seems to be one of those features that will make or
break Linux for many departments.  It also has a nice lead-in from the
NT/UNIX filesystem sentence.

You're right.  Done.

=)

I think it does.  It is one of those things that we want to drill into the press,
so the misconceptions about Free Software end.  Maybe if some of them actually
follow the link, they'll start to understand.  I will add this to the survey that
I'll be distributing in a little while.

I removed distributions and said "systems," just to see what everyone thinks.

I fixed this per a suggestion from Jim Gettys.  It may need some fixing, however,
as you'll see...

Only people who have an UltraSPARC are going to care.  For them, it's good that
it's there.  Others will ignore it.  Not everyone is going to care about
multimedia support, either, but we have that in there...

I changed it to this for now.  I want to see what others think, although I think
it's fine.  "Cost-effective Internet groups" was just too much cheese in one
sentence, IMO. =)

Yep, it looks like you're right.  Umm..... we should consider what the
consequences are if we don't abide by this.  We could also go the old way, as
I suggested to Jim Gettys: UN*X.  It removes some of the professionalism, but at
least we don't lose the great Vinod quote, because we can just put in "[UN*X]" in
place of "UNIX." =)

Keep in mind that a lot of this was here WAY before I started modifying it.
I basically did cut-and-paste on the URL section.

Oops!  Sorry, that was unintentional, although having read Slashdot for many
months, I understand why you would get angry about this.  I was rearranging the
URLs, and that was the first one on the list, so I guess it got chopped.  It's
back now.
Okay, the latest draft (5) follows.  Comments are appreciated.

**** DRAFT **** PRESS RELEASE - LINUX KERNEL 2.2.0 **** DRAFT ****
**** FORK 1 **** FINAL-5 DRAFT
Linux kernel version 2.2.0 released
FOR RELEASE: Tuesday 26 January 1999
Contact: linux-2.2@linuxunited.org
SANTA CLARA, C.A. -- Today Linus Torvalds, the primary developer and
coordinator of the Linux kernel team, releases a major new version of the
Linux kernel.  This update brings substantial performance improvements and
a multitude of new features.
* Advanced network routing and wide area network (WAN) support give Linux
  the ability to replace many expensive, proprietary network devices.
  Users can take control of their intranets with support for usage limits,
  accounting, firewalls, and virtual private networks.
* Strong 256-bit encryption, uncompromised by US export restrictions, is
  available as an add-on component. It protects both network
  infrastructure and hard disk storage, including swap space.
* Owing to its tradition of open and international development, Linux is
  positioned as an operating system ready for the new millennium.  Linux
  2.2 is Y2K ready and continues to build on previous versions'
  internationalization.
* Enterprise-level network filesystem support, with data replication for
  performance, mobility, and extreme reliability, ensures that file
  server destruction does not stop business.
* New multimedia capabilities in Linux 2.2 include video capture support,
  TV tuner support, and enhanced audio support.
* A wide variety of new SCSI and parallel port devices are now supported,
  including disk drives, tape drives, and other external devices.
* Already legendary performance is significantly enhanced.  High-end
  symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) support scales well, supporting systems
  with up to 64 processors.
* Compatibility with Windows NT and Unix filesystems enables Linux 2.2 to
  seamlessly handle data from legacy systems.  SAMBA gives a Linux system
  the ability to provide a complete replacement for NT Server services,
  including file and print sharing and domain authentication.
* Because Linux operates under an open development model, every user has
  the ability to modify the operating system components and submit patches
  to the official distribution.  This both facilitates the development of
  new features and enables users to repair problems within hours after
  they have been located.
Linux 2.2 is available for free download on the Internet: visit the Linux
Kernel Archive (
http://www.kernel.org/
) to obtain it from a worldwide
network of mirror servers which has been established in anticipation of
massive demand for this new version.  As always, the Linux kernel is
distributed as Free Software under the terms of the GNU General Public
License (
http://www.fsf.org/copyleft/gpl.html
).
Linux distribution vendors are expected to ship fully-integrated systems
using the new kernel before Q2 1999.  Business users should look to their
distribution vendors for information about this important upgrade.
ABOUT LINUX
"Linux" is the common name for a class of secure network operating systems
based on the Linux kernel and other open source software including the Free
Software Foundation's GNU Project, the Apache web server, Samba, the X
Window System, and BSD UNIX.  Linux takes full advantage of modern,
high-end x86, Power Mac, Alpha, and UltraSPARC hardware.  It can also
breathe life into older machines -- even 386- and 486-based computers.
Networks of Linux computers can provide supercomputer-like performance for
some applications; one widely-known example is the dramatic 3-D scenes in
the blockbuster movie "Titanic", which were rendered on Alpha-powered Linux
systems.
Both traditional support contracts and cost-effective Internet support
resources are widely available.  Linux is provided under an unlimited-use
license that lets users make in-house customizations to the system itself.
Recent estimates suggest that Linux has up to 20 million users worldwide.
Microsoft employees Josh Cohen and Vinod Valloppillil, in a competitive
examination of Linux (The so-called "Halloween Document",
http://www.opensource.org/halloween.html
), wrote that "Linux represents a
best-of-breed UNIX, that is trusted on mission critical applications, and -
due to its open source code - has a long term credibility which exceeds
many other competitive operating systems."
ABOUT LINUS TORVALDS
Linus Torvalds, originally from Finland, lives with his family in Santa
Clara, CA, USA.  He and others created Linux as an open-source alternative
to proprietary, closed operating systems after becoming disillusioned with
the poor quality and prohibitive pricing of commercial offerings.
Linux is a registered trademark of Linus Torvalds.  Power Mac is a
trademark of Apple Computer, Inc.  UltraSPARC is a trademark of Sun
Microsystems, Inc.  Alpha is a trademark of Compaq Computer Corporation.
The X Window System and UNIX are a trademark and a registered trademark,
respectively, of The Open Group.  Microsoft and Windows NT are trademarks
of Microsoft Corporation.  All other trademarks and registered trademarks
are properties of their respective owners.
