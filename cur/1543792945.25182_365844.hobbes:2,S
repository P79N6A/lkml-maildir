I posted a different fix here about a month ago (but I sent it 3 times,
as it was twice wrong). Andrew was about to merge it in his tree but I
have not checked yet. It was different in the sense that it used
msecs_to_jiffies() to do the arithmetic in the best possible way depending
on the HZ value and the ints size. Most of the time (when 1000 % HZ == 0),
it will simplify the operations to a single divide by a constant and
correctly check for integer overflows. Eg, with HZ=250, a simple 2 bits
right shift will replace a multiply followed by an divide.
I'll check whether 2.6.14-mm1 has it, otherwise I can repost it.
Cheers,
Willy
