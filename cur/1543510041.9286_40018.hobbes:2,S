I'm wondering what advantages I'm gonna get from buying an Alpha...
Thinking of an AlphaPC 164UX 2MB L3 Cache motherboard with Alpha 21164
processor at 633 mhz.
Is that comparable with an intel pII/pIII processor at the same rate?
Will ext2 cut me some slack about the >2 gig file limit ?
Is Alpha ideal for huge databases?
I've heard about 2-3 times speedup in floating point ops, is that a fact?
All pros an cons are really helpful...
I appriciate all the info i can get.
