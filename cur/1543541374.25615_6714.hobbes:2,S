I have another issue with devfs: I am starting it from boot, but when I 
shutdown the shutdown script cannot unmount /dev, and the machine hangs. 
Anyone know what the solution is?

Might this be the cause of the 3c509 problems I reported a while ago (and 
which Donald says a number of other people have reported to him)? If the 
ethernet card wasn't being initialised properly, perhaps you would get the 
effect I am seeing (no link light, TXs always collide)?
What needs to happen to the driver to adapt to these changes?
