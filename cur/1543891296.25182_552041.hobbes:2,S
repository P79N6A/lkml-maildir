Hmmm... We got there because SLUB initially return NULL for kmalloc(0). 
Rationale: The user did not request any memory so we wont give him 
any.
That (to my surprise) caused some strange behavior of code and so we then 
decided to keep SLAB behavior and return the smallest available object 
size and put a warning in there. At some later point we plan to switch
to returning NULL for kmalloc(0).

The smallest allocation that SLUB can do is 8 bytes (SLAB 32). We are
giving the user the smallest object that we can allocate. We could just 
remove the warning and would have the behavior that you want.
But now allocating code gets memory although none was requested. The 
object can be modified without us being able to check.
By returning NULL any use of the returned pointer would BUG.
An allocation of zero bytes usually indicates that the code is not dealing 
with a special case. Later code may operate on the allocated object. I 
think its clearer and cleaner if code would deal with that special case 
explicitly. We have seen a series of code pieces that do uncomfortably 
looking operations on structures with no objects.
