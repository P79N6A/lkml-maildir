I don't know if this is a similar problem, but my machine just freezes 
now and then, too. I use SuSE linux 6.x with kernels 2.2.5 and 2.2.7
on different hardware. The problem appears only to show up if an
X-Server is running. Which type of X-Server and which gfx card is
obviously not important. I can't reproduce the crashes, but they
happen every now and then. Sometimes as soon as 20 minutes after
reboot, sometimes everything goes well to up to 14 days or so.
The hardware is: 
Machine A:
P-II-400, ASUS P2B-F, 128 Meg, various different extension cards, but
the crashes seem to be independent of the current hardware.
Machine B:
AMD K6-3-450, ASUS T2P4, 64 Meg, various extension cards as above.
Ciao,
Tobias
