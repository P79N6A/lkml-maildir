  Boy, I haven't been beat up by Amdahl's law for at least 10 years. :-)
  A point to mention is that Amdahl's law also applies to scaling on
  clusters.  Same issues as SMP as far as application scalability
  is concerned.
  But the point is that there are a whole bunch of applications that
  can have the serial portion reduce to such a small amount that they
  can benefit from lots of CPUS.

  You know there used to be a whole bunch of companies doing this
sort of work and they all went out of business because people could
build a cluster out of off the shelf parts for 1/10 of the cost and
get good enough performance.  ETA, CDC, the old Cray the list goes
on. All gone from the CPU business because good enough cheap enough
wins every time.
