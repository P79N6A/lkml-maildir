Looks like it might be similar to one I saw with smatch recently.  There
are several places in core.c that check info->tty before dereferencing
it, but others that don't.  I don't think this will fix the one you are
seeing, but if it's easily reproducible you could try doing something
similar in uart_block_til_ready.
