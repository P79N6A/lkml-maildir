It is. I've been running 2.6 on a dual p2 for quite some time, with good
results. It is also running with priority 0 under 2.4.

The problem does not seem interactivity, but some clocks which drift
apart. The framerate is constantly above 100 fps, there are no
background daemons/cron jobs running, remote top doesn't show any
unusual activity. For now, after several reboots and switching back and
forth between 2.6 and 2.4 it seems to be gone under 2.6. I'll see if it
comes back again. I guess a 'vmstat 1` snapshot would be good in this case?
Thanks,
Jan
