They most likely receive the same transaction (this is not like journaling 
transaction --- new transactions are issued only on conditions above).
A/foo entry is set with txc=memory_cct[memory_cc],cc=memory_cc
B/foo entry is set with txc=memory_cct[memoty_cc]|0x80000000,cc=memory_cc
C/foo entry is set with txc=memory_cct[memory_cc],cc=memory_cc
D/foo entry is set with txc=memory_cct[memoty_cc]|0x80000000,cc=memory_cc
They may be written in any order (that's some improvement over 
journaling) by buffer thread.
And when you sync, with one write of memory_cct to disk, you make old 
entries permanently invalid and new entries permanently valid.
If the machine crashes before sync (and some of directory sectors were 
written and some not), new entries will always be considered invalid, and 
old entries always valid, because new crash count will be used and crash 
count table at old crash count index will never be modified.
