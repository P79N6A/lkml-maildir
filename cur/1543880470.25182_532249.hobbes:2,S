I used the following command 
   tcpdump -w nfs-traffic -i eth0 -vv -tt dst port nfs
to capture
   
http://iucha.net/nfs/21-rc7-nfs4/nfs-traffic.bz2
I started the capture before starting the copy and left it to run for
a few minutes after the traffic slowed to a crawl.
The iostat and vmstat are at:
   
http://iucha.net/nfs/21-rc7-nfs4/iostat
   
http://iucha.net/nfs/21-rc7-nfs4/vmstat
It seems that my original problem report had a big mistake!  There is
no hang, but at some point the write slows down to a trickle (from
40,000 blocks/s to 22 blocks/s) as can be seen from the iostat log.
