Do you have changes to file Changes.txt as part of your patch ? I'm not against
moving things out of kernel (if thing relly belond to userspace then it's good
thing) but IMNSHO any time it's done one additional item should be added to
Changes file so peoples will be able to use userspace solution without deep
search...
