- Kexec code does not wait infinitely for destination cpu to respond to
  NMI. If destination cpu does not reposond in certain amount of time,
  execution continues. So even if NMI was not delivered to destination
  cpu kexec code should have continued. (Dangerous though, as we don't
  know what other cpu will be doing in the mean time.)
- Even if there is a limitation on how many interrupts can be queued up
  (including NMI), I am not sure how this patch will help that situation.
  This patch is not doing anything on destination cpu (assuming destination
  cpu is also not executing die_nmi() at the same time)
  In fact, even if other cpus are servicing die_nmi() they will end up
  spinning on kexec_lock inside crash_kexec().
I think there is more to this problem then just EOI stuff.
