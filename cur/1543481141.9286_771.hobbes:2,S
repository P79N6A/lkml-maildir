I do have less problems with NS nowadays but there are instances where it
simply boms out, without telling why at all.

probably. however, I fail to see why it only happens to NS and not other
software built with different libs et al.
I do compile a lot myself and almost never install a binary, ecept for most
X stuff since that takes a lot of time, space etc.
I still tend to think that NS _is_ a problem and I hope that some day, a
seriously stable version is available.
