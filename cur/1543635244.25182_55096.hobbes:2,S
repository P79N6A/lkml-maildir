> Is IRQ10 assigned to the ISA bus in your BIOS ?
This system has no options of that sort in its BIOS... (Its a compaq from
about '94 or '95, for reference)
I assume that this means it doesn't care where the IRQs originate. I'm also
pretty sure i've tried setting it up with different IRQs as well. (I will
try again to be certain)
