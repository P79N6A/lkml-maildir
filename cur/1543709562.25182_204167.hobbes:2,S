Same here on a Toshiba 1410-s173 noteboook:
[logger] ACPI group battery / action battery is not defined
[kernel] ACPI-0279: *** Error: Looking up [BUFF] in namespace, 
         AE_ALREADY_EXISTS
I don't think it's happened in less than 24 hours of uptime, during which
everything is good. I have been using suspend to ram daily if that matters
(echo 3 > /proc/acpi/sleep).
