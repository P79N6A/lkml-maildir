I have a version of libc that has a lot of code written in assembly.
All of the Linux interface, all the string stuff, etc. You can have a
copy, if you want. That is a start.
This will be a big project. There's a lot more to the Linux kernel than
just creating some I/O capability. Linux has to emulate Unix so it's
a lot more work than rolling your own 32-bit OS with a file-system.
