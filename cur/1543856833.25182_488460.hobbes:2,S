Hello !
Here comes kernel 2.4.34-rc1.
It contains a fix for CVE-2006-5871 (smbfs ignoring mount options).
Thanks to Dann Frazier for the backport of the fix. Other fixes are
mostly non-serious bugs, which constitute a good reason to produce
a release candidate.
Please test it and build it on several architectures if you can.
I'll only merge build fixes and critical fixes in forth-coming
-rc if any.
Regards,
Willy
