   tell me why async I/O is important
   to Java and not to anything else, which still seems the thrust of
   your remarks.
Not precisely my thrust, which is that AIO is not important to any
significant population of Linux users, it is "nook and cranny" in
scope.  And that those "nook and cranny" folks who really find it
important can get paid implementation+support of AIO.
