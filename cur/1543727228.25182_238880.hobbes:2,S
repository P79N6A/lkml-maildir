Actually, p->prio < MAX_RT_PRIO iff rt_task(p). This can't change 
without horribly breaking
stuff.

Conversely, p->prio < MAX_RT_PRIO neatly defines a task as being 
realtime without worrying
about what exact policy it is using. However if you add or remove 
scheduling policies, your
p->policy method breaks.
