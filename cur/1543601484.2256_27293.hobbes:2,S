What?  I'm saying that devfs was a huge patch which was not understood
(let alone audited) by anyone except you when it was included and as
the direct result we have a long history of problems in that area.

If you still feel that feeding devfs into the tree in one huge chunk was
not a mistake - you are much dumber than I thought.
