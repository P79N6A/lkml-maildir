Subject: [PATCH] blk_start_queue must be called with irq disabled - add warning
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

The queue lock can be taken from interrupts so it must always be taken with irq
disabling primitives. Some primitives already verify this.
blk_start_queue() is called under this lock, so interrupts must be disabled.
Also document this requirement clearly in blk_init_queue(), where the queue
spinlock is set.
