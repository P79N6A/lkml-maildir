I dunno, no real scientific measures at all, but I have noticed using 'free' 
all boxes from boot load load like 40%  less in memory.  As time goes on, 
memory usage grows (of course), but now it 'drops off' when not being used... 
2.4.2x never done that.
I tested today on my Slackware box especially:
Linux linuxamd 2.4.28 #1 Tue Nov 23 17:46:52 GMT 2004 i686 unknown unknown 
GNU/Linux  (HM, append="1280M").
An Athlon 1.2Ghz  running all up to date Slack 10 stable with KDE 3.3.0 
upgrade.
I ran Celestia for over an hour, burnt a few knoppix ISO's, and then ISO'ed a 
big directory to burn all using 'BashBurn'.
Just played Quake2 for three maps running full chat.
Normally memory slowly fills up, perhaps using swap for a bit under these 
circumstances - but looking afterwards:
root@linuxamd:~# free
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:       1292348     520012     772336          0      38596     327304
-/+ buffers/cache:     154112    1138236
Swap:      1959888          0    1959888
I would normally expect 'free' to report 900000 odd (with Celestia pushing 
toward swap) by now... but it doesn't.
Another box,:
Linux quake.ddayuk.dyndns.org 2.4.28 #1 Tue Nov 23 17:28:32 GMT 2004 i686 
unknown
Runs a Quake2 server and Teamspeak.  Again, usually after 2 hours uptime 
nearly hits peak, but now:
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:        516440      45368     471072          0       6296      25556
-/+ buffers/cache:      13516     502924
Swap:       265032          0     265032
The box at work is a back-up httpd (apache) web server running NTPD for whole 
sub-net, mrtg, and a lot of other stuff (I use for testing stuff until I push 
to main web server)... this always has 30/40MB disk swap.  Today only 6MB.
I build all kernels with no modules, all built in (expect USB for memory 
sticks on slack).  The only change I done this time from previous kernel 
upgrades was download the full 2.4.28 bz2 file rather than apply patches to 
existing build trees (make oldconfig).
But whatever, I am impressed indeed - somethings changed for the good!!!
