Hi,
In include/linux/kernel.h I currently have the following lines at the 
bottom of the file:
/* Rebuild everything on CONFIG_FTRACE_MCOUNT_RECORD */
#ifdef CONFIG_FTRACE_MCOUNT_RECORD
# define REBUILD_DUE_TO_FTRACE_MCOUNT_RECORD
#endif
This is only there to force a rebuild of all files when 
CONFIG_FTRACE_MCOUNT_RECORD is modified. Since the modification of that 
config causes the build to act different, we need to rebuild all C 
objects. I added the #ifdef in kernel.h as a hack to force the rebuild by 
the config dependencies used in kbuild.
My question is, is there a better way to force a full rebuild on a 
modification of a config?
Thanks,
