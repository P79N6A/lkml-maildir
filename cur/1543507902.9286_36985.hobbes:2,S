I am not sure if this is a kernel issue or if it is gpm but is there any
way to change the cursor from a block to something else like a normal
pointing cursor when using the framebuffer? I imagine yes, but would
this be in the kernel code, or do I need to look into gpm?
Also the penguins are cute,  and I have two of them (SMP) but they are
the reson my screen gets  resized. Is there a "nopenguin" commad line
option or some way of using the framebuffer without having them there?
(Sorry if I offend anyone)
I.E rather than show the penguins at the top of my screen, I'd like to
set them in the console screenblanker. Yes I saw something similar
somewhere else and liked the idea.
