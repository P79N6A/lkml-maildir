Yes access_process_vm down_writes the mmap_sem.  However; it can only read 
and write to existing user pages.  As long as it doesn't delete any of them 
its not a problem.  It won't cause a dead lock or panic during the core dump 
processing if this happens.  
The only process I know that could honestly use this ptrace function is GDB 
doing live debugging.

For Ia64 those down_writes are just a pain.  If a user application is 
crashing because someone is being rude with GDB corrupting its user pages 
then I don't think its worth the hassle of protecting the core dumped user 
page mm data from being messed up by a GDB user.
I would like to leave the down_write out of elf_core_dump, but it could be 
put back if its felt that its needed.
