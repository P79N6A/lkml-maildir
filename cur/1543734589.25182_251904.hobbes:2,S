You could simply set xtime and time_source_last = time_source_get(time_source);
I think the existing wall_to_monotonic stuff is okay. Monotonic time is
rarely used and thus its best to keep xtime on CLOCK_REALTIME to simplify
things for general time access.

xtime is also truly monotonic increasing in my proposal. Setting the time
is an extraordinary event which I would not count against monotoneity. The
clock corrections that I proposed all preserve the monotoneity of xtime.

Yes. My interpolator logic limits begin to show....

I have no idea how adjtimex works. Would have to look at that in detail
first. The timer interpolator stuff also does time adjustments and I am
sure that something like that is in my mind. The time interpolator only
ever corrects the clock forward. Otherwise it adjusts the scaling if the
clock is running too fast. Thats also what I provided in the proposal.

xtime is the traditional name. Maybe renaming it to intentionally break
old code would be good but I thought it would be good to understand
the approach.

That sounds very promising. I may also have to make time for
different projects but I will try to do as much as I can.
