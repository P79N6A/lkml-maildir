Ok. You are right that ACPI is an ugly piece of mess. But I'm pretty
sure that 90%+ of ACPI notebook implementations *will* want to talk to
their monitoring chips... for temperature readings.
So even if we fixed ACPI to reserve the ports, you'd be still unhappy;
lm-sensors would break at least on all the notebooks.

...against wishes of the manufacturers. Which sometimes know what they
are doing. (Sometimes not :-).

Well, I'm afraid you should assume all recent notebooks touch sensors
from ACPI.

What about whitelist? DMI-based? That's only way to do it, I'm afraid.

Yes, I know ACPI sucks at hardware monitoring. Unfortunately, we can't
go without ACPI.

Fix the interface? ;-). Actually that move may be underway as we are
moving out of /proc.

Whitelist seems like a way to go :(.
