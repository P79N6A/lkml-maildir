Then upgrade to file-4.07 which fixes this bad identification. I was very
annoyed by this problem because I too sometimes generate rather tiny
executables, and my build scripts automatically mark them as executables
when 'file' tells me they are ELF executables. When I discovered it, it
was because the victim was init...
