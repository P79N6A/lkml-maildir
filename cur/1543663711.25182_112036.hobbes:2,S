Rant? It was just a catalogue of other things that are nasty. The
point was that PAE's not special, it's one of a very long list of
very ugly uglinesses, and my list wasn't anywhere near exhaustive.
But yes, more cache is good. Unfortunately the amount of baggage from
32-bit x86 stuff still puts a good chunk of systems programming into
the old bring your own barfbag territory.

Well, it beats the heck out of the TSC and the PIT, and x86-64 is
apparently supposed to have it "for real".
I'm not excited at all about another opcode prefix and pagetable format.
