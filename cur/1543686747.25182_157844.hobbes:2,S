It could be really cool if in sysfs be a file with
video modes, something like this:
1024x768x24@80
1024x768x24@60
800x600x24@60
600x400x16@75
and other file named current_mode (or something) with the
current setting, you just echo a value there and bingo,
a video mode change with the desired refresh rate, is that
hard? EDID and modedb can help us here.
Don't you think?
