I'm told Linus refuses to do anything that would help establish and
support binary drivers, even if someone else does the work for him and
doesn't cause any bugs or interfere with the other systems inside the
kernel.
I'm not sure if this is true or not, but moving to modules-only sounds
like a good first step to "Hey, let's do binary drivers to get third
party support and become a real competing desktop OS"  "Hey, let's do
binary drivers"  "Hey, let's do binary drivers"  "SHUT THE HELL UP"
"But hey man, binary drivers, we're already at all modules for drivers"
~ "Hey, binary drivers"  "ALRIGHT FINE *grumble*"
Not that I don't fully support closed-source binary drivers as a way to
get hardware working until better, cleaner, open source alternatives
show up, mind you. . . :)
