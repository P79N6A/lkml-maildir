Ehmmm, ohoh, I did a little mistake in arca-vm-24 that was causing a
lockup under heavy swapping ;) (I was still decrementing counter in the
grow_freeable() while loop...) 
So I diffed a fixed arca-vm-25 that rocks here. It's against pre-8.gz in
testing. This new one should be really safe (and pre8 is also fixing also
the swapout deadlock making the semaphores recursive). Give me comments if
you'll try it. arca-vm-24/25 still seems far better than anything tried
before here. I don't think I could do something better than it for 2.2.
