If you don't care about the data...

Mechanical != trivial, and much less == "does it by itself, all alone"...

Which helps how in getting more new people up to speed and involved in bug
fixing? (Last I heard, that was the current bottleneck...)

That kind of stuff is currently sitting in bugzillas all over the

can reproduce the bug (and that may mean getting an obscure piece of
hardware, etc) and then see if they can fix it.
