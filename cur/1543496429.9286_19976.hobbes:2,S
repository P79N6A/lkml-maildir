Subject: sparc help -- kernel 2.2.7 doesn't work
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

I'm new to linux on a sparc (definately not on x86, used it for 3 years on
x86 =)
Ok, what happens is silo gets to booting linux and nothing shows up.  The
mainboard is a sparc 10.  No framebuffer, no keyboard.  The console is ttya. 
I have the kernel (2.2.1) that came with debian-sparc 2.1 (slink) installed
and working.  I compiled the kernel on the sparc as I didn't want to get
into cross compiling.
I have included the .config from the sparc's kernel.
I don't have the .config for the 2.2.1, so I'm asking for assistance (the
thing has 2 supersparc 50's, but this kernel only works on 1 chip.  It takes
about 1 hour to compile so I wanna get it right the first time if I can)
-- thanx
