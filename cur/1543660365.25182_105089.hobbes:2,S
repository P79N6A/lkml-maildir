Er, if it has no development environment, why are you bitching about the 
fact that it's not possible to compile kernel modules on it?
The box which holds your firewall's kernel source can be used to compile 
extra out-of-tree modules. The directory /lib/modules/`uname -r`/build, 
while a reasonable _default_ for out-of-tree modules to use, should 
generally be overridable with a directory specified by yourself.
