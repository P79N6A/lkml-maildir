Hi,
I am new to bit keeper. I'd like to know if a separate repository has been
created for 2.6 ? The bitkeeper web page shows linux-2.4 and linux-2.6. Does
this mean that linux-2.5 is now actually the 2.6 kernel ? Can somebody
explain how this transition will occur ? If I work on the linux-2.5
repository how can I make sure my local copy can be kept in sync when it is
changed to 2.6 ?
Thanks
Jesus
