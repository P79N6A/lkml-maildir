Patched against 2.5.1-pre9: fix to compile order in drivers/media/video, 
specifically for the Zoran 36067 driver. I patched part of the compilation 
order in the 2.4.13-ac8 series, but this was missed. Fixes the Makefile so 
that the various PCI bridge drivers ($CONFIG_VIDEO_ZORAN_BUZ, ..._LML33, 
..._DC10) are compiled into the kernel before the actual zr36067 driver is 
($CONFIG_VIDEO_ZORAN). It's not the best solution, but I couldn't come up with 
anything else that allowed the zr36067 driver to be compiled into the kernel.
