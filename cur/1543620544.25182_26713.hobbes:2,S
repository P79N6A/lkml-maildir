Mounted filesystems:
/dev/hda2 on / type ext2 (rw)
none on /proc type proc (rw)
...
none on /proc type proc (rw)
/dev/hda3 on /suse type ext2 (rw)
none on /proc type proc (rw)
none on /proc/bus/usb type usbdevfs (rw)
/dev/cfs0 on /overlay type coda (rw)
(I wander what is responsible for mounting /proc hundred times?)
But... you should know that I'm strongly suspecting ide subsystem:
Feb  8 12:08:02 amd kernel: hda: status timeout: status=0xd0 { Busy }
Feb  8 12:08:02 amd kernel: hda: drive not ready for command
Feb  8 12:08:02 amd kernel: ide0: reset: success
Feb  8 12:09:26 amd kernel: hda: status timeout: status=0xd0 { Busy }
Feb  8 12:09:26 amd kernel: hda: drive not ready for command
Feb  8 12:09:26 amd kernel: ide0: reset: success
Feb  8 12:12:27 amd kernel: hda: status timeout: status=0xd0 { Busy }
Feb  8 12:12:27 amd kernel: hda: drive not ready for command
Feb  8 12:12:27 amd kernel: ide0: reset: success
I'm trying to test it with md5sum, but so far it behaves ok. [I wonder
what directory I'll loose this time ... :-(]
