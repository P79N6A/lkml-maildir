HI David ,
Thanks a Lot for clearing all the doubts , yes its the drawback of my
hardware which i cant use high speed compact flash as DMA is not supported
,
Is there anyway with the help of software to message that , this compact
flash cant be used anymore , first of all is this a good idea to have such
a functinality on embedded system of saying compact flash is going to die
please replace it , or just by the number of years of compact flash we say
replace the compact flash
Thanks In Advance
Somshekar

The 16-bit PCMCIA bus is maxed out at about 1 MB/sec; that's all the
bandwidth there is.  What your card supports is irrelevant.
I'm not sure whether the PCMCIA mode actually corresponds to any of
the official PIO modes 0, 1, etc.  It is just "slow".
