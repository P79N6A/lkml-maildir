  Your "Integrated Technology Express" addition is missing but I'm

  I've been including one-liners even if they only fix rare cases or
aren't strictly bugfixes, but the larger ones are riskier:
    - backport of the rq-lock patch almost certainly created a profiling
      bug if the retry path is taken.
    - the timers-and-signals patch fixes three things; only one is urgent.
  And Hugh's VM accounting patches look very worthwhile (they just went into
mainline.)  I took one and might merge the other two - but they change
statm reporting.
  Getting them to merge and compile is the easy part...
