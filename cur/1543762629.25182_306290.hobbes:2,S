On the contrary, it's just because it's not important at all that I
thought it could go in, the same way as other parts of unused code
got removed in rc2 (eg: jfs aops). As to the fact that it's late,
well, I would have prefered sending it sooner, but I simply don't
decide when I have spare time for this.
I have no problem at all with all these patches not merged, I simply
think that it makes maintainers' work easier to support homogeneous
code across versions with the least possible dead code, especially
when it comes to simple patches like this one. If you think it's better
to keep unused code because it makes debugging funnier, OK, that's fine.
Anyway, I'm just proposing, maintainers decide.
