Hi Alan - a surprising reaction.
The patch is an improvement - it #ifdef's out some dead code.
I sent you a follow-up patch that activates the dead code,
since you said
  I have one here running 2.4 still. I can test a 2.6 fix
  for the mtrr init happily enough.
But so far you have not replied.
The moment you report that the follow-up patch is fine, we can
remove the #if 0 and insert the initcalls instead.
So, all is well today, and we are waiting for your report.
Andries
