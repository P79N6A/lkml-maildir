This is not about different vendors certifying the same level. Mainstream
software will always require a general fix-level, however internal software
may require some other hardening/configuration. Distributions and even end
users could use that string to certify "this build is compliant to
requirement level 123"
But I agree, it might be overkill for the utsname, however I feel leaving
that out of a secure level syscall may be underkill .)
