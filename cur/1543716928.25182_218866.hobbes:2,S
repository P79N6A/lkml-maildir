Subject: [PATCH] Bug Fix: 2.6.5 broken module dependencies: i8042 and atkbd?

    Dan> I've successfully and repeated hanged vanilla 2.6.5 kernel.
    Dan> Here is how I do it:
    Dan> 1) Configure and compile kernel (on Intel x86) so that
    Dan>    'serio', 'i8042', 'atkbd' are all modules.  i.e.
    Dan>    CONFIG_SERIO_I8042=m CONFIG_SERIO=m CONFIG_KEYBOARD_ATKBD=m
    Dan> 2) Boot the compiled kernel.  
    Dan> 3) Log in from network.  
    Dan> 4) modprobe the following modules in order: serio, i8042, atkbd
    Dan> 5) Now, keyboard works, as expected.  6) rmmod i8042 ===>
    Dan>    hangs.  CAPSLOCK doesn't respond (of course, i8042 is
    Dan>    rmoved), machine doesn't respond to ping (why?), although my
    Dan>    PCMCIA network card still blinks and the hardware indicate of
    Dan>    PCMCIA activity also blinks.  But (un)plugging the PCMCIA
    Dan>    card gives no response.
    Dan> The same is observed in 2.6.6-rc3.
I've found and fixed the bug.
It has  nothing to  do with module  dependencies.  Rather, it's  a bug
with improper shutdown of a timer.
Cause: When the i8042 module  is unloaded, the i8042_exit() shuts down
       it  timer  by calling  del_timer_sync().   However, after  that
       call, there can still be interrupts from the i8042 chip (due to
       keyboard  or  mouse activities).   Such  interrupts invoke  the
       interrupt   handler   i8042_interrupt(),   which   would   call
       mod_timer() to reschedule a  new timer event.  But i8042_exit()
       won't want  for this new timer  event.  It may  exit before the
       event arrives.   The module is unloaded  as i8042_exit() exits,
       but this  can happen  before the new  timer event comes.   As a
       result,  when  the timer  expires,  the  kernel  tries to  call
       i8042_timer_func(), which has been unloaded!  This results in a
       complete freeze.
The Fix: is  to make sure interrupts from the  i8042 chip are disabled
         before calling  del_timer_sync() to  clean up the  timer.  In
         i8042_exit(), this  is as easy  as swapping the order  of the
         calls to del_timer_sync() and i8042_controller_cleanup().
