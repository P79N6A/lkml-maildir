  Hi, all. Version 138 of my devfs patch is now available from:
http://www.atnf.csiro.au/~rgooch/linux/kernel-patches.html
The devfs FAQ is also available here.
This work has been sponsored by SGI.
This is against 2.3.25. Highlights of this release:
- Fixed old bugs in drivers/block/paride/pt.c, drivers/char/tpqic02.c,
  drivers/net/wan/cosa.c and drivers/scsi/scsi.c
  Thanks to Sergey Kubushin <ksi@ksi-linux.com>
- Fall back to major table if NULL fops given to <devfs_register>
				Regards,
					Richard....
