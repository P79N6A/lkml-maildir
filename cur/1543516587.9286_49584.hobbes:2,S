Supermicro P6DNF with dual Pentium Pros @ 166MHz, chipset is 440FX.
Memmory is two slabs of 72pin 60ns 128MB SIMMs (Not sure of the make),
making a total of 256MB. 
I had an idea 10 mins ago and set the machine to 70ns and the memory
errors have gone away. Labelled on the chips themselves is "60ns EDO".
Think I've been palmed off with dodgy memory? These were replacements! 
Cheers, 
Alex
