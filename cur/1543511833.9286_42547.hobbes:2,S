From the description, I would say that there is a bug, but it is NOT
that the route isn't removed.
Deleting the route when an interface is taken down is like deleting a
symlink when the target file is deleted. It's extremely frustrating if
you have a non-trivial configuration and all you wanted to do was to
attempt to reset the ethernet controller with rmmod/insmod.
