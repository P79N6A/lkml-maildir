	No, only similar patch for hpt366.c.
	I think the (almost) correct scheme is following ...
Yes, larger changes are possible - and in fact I have a directory
full of IDE stuff, polishing, cleanup, non-urgent.
I sent this mainly because the hpt366.c analog was needed to
prevent filesystem corruption (on my own system). Similarly,
I imagine this patch is needed to prevent filesystem corruption -
no need to wait until someone actually reports a corrupted filesystem.
Patches that allow people to set lower PIO modes than the max
may be nice, but are less urgent than preventing modes higher
than the max.
