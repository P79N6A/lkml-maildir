They are all based on HD audio which is supported by OSS. Ok, our HDA 
driver driver still needs some work which was one of the reasons why we 
are moving to the community development model.

Exactly. Good to know that we are both thinking in the same way.

I think it's going to be constructive.
We have no intention to push OSS back to the kernel or to replace ALSA. 
That alternative is not realistic any more. In addition OSS is a 
cross-platform product and staying more or less outside various kernel 
trees should provide better flexibility.
What we would like to push is that the old "deprecated" OSS/Free are 
removed from the kernel. OSS/Free is based on about years old OSS API 
version which was too limited for many applications. Having OSS/Free in 
the kernel doesn't serve any purpose.
Also we would like to stop the silly OSS vs ALSA war. OSS and ALSA are 
rather different. Both of them have some good points and bad points. For 
ordinary users it doesn't matter which API is used by the applications 
as long as they work. Just the application developers can see the real 
difference. Some of them prefer OSS while some other prefer ALSA and 
this should be their "freedom of choice".
I think the ideal solution would be that both ALSA and OSS APIs can 
co-exist by sharing the same low level drivers (which has already been 
demonstrated). The low level driver interfaces in both systems are 
practically identical. This means that ALSA's core can work with OSS' 
drivers and vice versa.
Today both OSS and ALSA teams have to spend significant amounts of time 
in emulating the "alien" APIs. Making OSS and ALSA to co-exist will 
require some work in both sides but that should be nothing when compared 
to the effort required for emulation.
Just my 2 cents.
Best regards,
Hannu
