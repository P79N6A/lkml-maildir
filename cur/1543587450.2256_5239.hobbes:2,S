No, performance really is peaked about 65 Mbps or so at the moment.  I'm
currently using the FA312 here, which was massively broken with my FA312
until 2.4.2-ac which updated the natsemi driver.  I have a '311 in a P200
which worked fine before.  This is an AMD box, but I suspect the problem
was the '312, not the AMD.
