Apologies for the broken patch and thanks for the fix,
But, the above is needed to fix the build even with CONFIG_PARAVIRT!!!
Apparently because arch/i386/mm/boot_ioremap.c undefs CONFIG_PARAVIRT.
Question is, now we have 2 versions of spin_locks_irq implementation
with CONFIG_PARAVIRT -- one with regular cli sti and other with virtualized 
CLI/STI -- sounds odd!
Thanks,
Kiran
