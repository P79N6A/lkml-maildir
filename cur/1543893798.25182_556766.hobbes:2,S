My guess:
Something needs memory but finds there is none to be had
oom-killer is invoked and targets myapp.
myapp takes some time to die. Particularly, the memory it uses
isn't freed up instantly. In the meantime something else
needs memory and find none. (Another packet received?)
The oom-killer is invoked again, this time it targets syslogd.
And so on.  The kernel do many things in parallel, running out
of memory in a multitasking system therefore is a complicated business.
Especially when process killing takes some time.
Note that you can turn off memory overcommit, your leaky app
should then get a memory allocation error instead of
triggering the oom-killer.
