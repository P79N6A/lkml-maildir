As does the framebufer console system. The problem is higher up console
limited design hinders true multihead support. I have seen your work
before. Its just I have been busy rewriting the fbdev API and rewriting
linux SGI direct rendering engine. So I haven't had the time to get a good
look at this. Sometime in the near future the fbdev team and your input
team need to come together to forge a new console system.
