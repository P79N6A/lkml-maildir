  our issues are mostly related to getting X up and running.  we've
  been looking at keeping most of the userland as 32bit, but still
  running a 64bit kernel.  this works fine, except for the nVidia
  kernel module and its attempt to talk to nVidias openGL libraries.
  it's a very long story.  but, as far as I remember, the 3ware card
  worked fine.

  correct, the kernels on our AMD64-boxes are currently built for
  i686.  I _might_ be able to use one of our FX-51-boxes to test 64bit
  usage of a 3ware PATA controller if you feel you can't take the
  slight gamble.  I'm not quite sure _when_ I can get this done
  though, maybe within a week or two?  but, since you really need to
  test SATA as well, I'd advice you to get a card and test it
  yourself.  I'd be very surprised if it didn't work.
