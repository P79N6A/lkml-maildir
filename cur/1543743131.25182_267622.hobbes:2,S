It occurs to me that half of the patch only applicable to HT, like the change
in wake_idle().  And also, do you really want to put that functionality in
wake_idle()?  Seems defeating the original intention of that function, which
only tries to wake up sibling cpu as far as how I understand the code.
My setup is 4-way SMP, no HT (4-way itanium2 processor), sorry, I won't be able
to tell you how this portion of the change affect online transaction workload.
