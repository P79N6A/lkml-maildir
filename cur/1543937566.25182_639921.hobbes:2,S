Venki/Andrew,
I think I found the root cause of the problem and a fix for it. 
The fix works for me.
Description
-----------
With the introduction of reserve_mattr() and free_mattr(), the ioremap* routines
started exploiting it. The recent 2.6.24-rc8-mm1 kernel has a peculiar problem
where in, certain devices disappear. In my case for example
e100: Intel(R) PRO/100 Network Driver, 3. 5.23-k4-NAPI
e100: Copyright(c) 1999-2006 Intel Corporation
ACPI: PCI Interrupt 0000:04:08.0[A] -> GSI 20 (level, low) -> IRQ 20
modprobe:2584 conflicting cache attribute 50000000-50001000 uncached<->default
e100: 0000:04:08.0: e100_probe: Cannot map device registers, aborting.
ACPI: PCI interrupt for device 0000:04:08.0 disabled
On further analysis, it was discovered that quirk_e100_interrupt() calls
ioremap(), which reserves memory attributes for the e100 card, but iounmap()
does not free it. The patch below removes the check fixes this problem.
It removes for the check of (p->flags >> 20), which checks for architecture
specific bits set on the vm_struct's flags member. ioremap() unconditionally
reserves memory attributes, iounmap() should undo it.
