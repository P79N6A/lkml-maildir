I think 2.3.51 is ok for bw_tcp (I've been playing with this and
comparing results with Alexey about just such a thing over the last
couple of days). We are about 10% slow that FreeBSD if it matters.
I think bw_pipe is hosed though. At least FreeBSD (3.4) is twice as
fast on my PPro200 and 2.3.51 (almost 200M/s vs 107M/s!). Ouch.
