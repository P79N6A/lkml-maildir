So, under a dual-licensed BSD/GPL code the latter license allows a 
developer to remove the GPL license itself and release a single-licensed 
BSD code if other parties want to do it?

I would assume a file as a boundary of a work in the case that file is 
under different licensing terms to the rest of the software package.  On a 
lot of software packages different modules are covered under different 
licensing terms.
We can choose what license terms we will honor; however, we do not have 
the ability to remove the licensing terms we do not like.
