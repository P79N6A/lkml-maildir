Once you get out of memory, there is no clean solution.
Putting the bloat in userland doesn't mean there is no
bloat -- the additional overhead will probably just
'uglify' the problem.
My solution works rather well so I don't see why there
are so much objections to it again...
We've had this whole discussion just before the 2.2pre
era, when I decided the kernel should stabilize and my
patch wasn't important enough to disturb the debugging.
I propose we stop this discussion until somebody produces
better CODE then what's in my patch.
