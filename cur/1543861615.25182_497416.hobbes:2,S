In my experience on openSUSE, the following sequence of commands
installs both the kernel and the initrd:
	make *config*
	make
	make modules_install
	make install
However, if the order of the last two make invocations is switched, then
the initrd does not get generated (correctly or at all). Although
unlikely to be the problem, it's a simple thing to eliminate from the
list of possible borkages.
