No.
All journaling filesystems need to be fsck'ed.
A correctly operating one simply doesn't need to be fsck'ed  because
of unexpected loss of operating system.    Which brings greatly reduce
the probability.  If an error is detected in the filesystem fsck is
still what you have to do to correct it.
