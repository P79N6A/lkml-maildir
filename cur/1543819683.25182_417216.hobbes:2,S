Indeed.  But if I do not define a rename operation at all then the mv 
command looses the target if the move fails, too.  So I don't see how the 
native rename needs to be any better other than for standards compliance.
Error recovery is actually pretty easy as if the second ntfs_unlink() 
fails I simply ntfs_unlink() the link I just created with ntfs_link().  
That already works fine.  But yes at the moment I do lose the target if 
either the ntfs_link() or the second ntfs_unlink() fails.
I am planning to fix this though.  It is not too hard because I can more 
or less just ntfs_link() it back in (with a few special casings).
Even if I implement are more "native" rename not using 
ntfs_unlink()/ntfs_link() I still have to remove the target first 
otherwise I cannot insert the new target because you cannot have two 
entries in the B+tree that have identical index keys (the index key is the 
filename itself so the two would be equal).  And I cannot simply replace 
the B+tree index entry because NTFS is not case sensitive so the two 
names (old and new) may not be in the same place in the B+tree.  The only 
thing I can do is to remove the old B+tree index entry and add the new one 
after that fact.  So no matter what I do, I have to be able to recreate 
the old index entry and that is just what ntfs_link() does which is why 
I chose my "simplified rename" approach in the first place.
Thanks a lot for you comments about the locking!
Best regards,
	Anton
