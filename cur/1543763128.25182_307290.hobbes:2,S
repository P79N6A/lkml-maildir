You misunderstand totally the EXPORT_GPL system.  It does not mean
"this is a technological system to prevent you to use it with non-gpl
compatible code".  It means "The author of that code consider that
using this function makes your code so linux-specific that it must be
a derivative work of the code implementing the function, so if you use
it from non gpl-compatible code you'll be sued.  And since he's nice,
he uses a technical method to prevent you from doing such a copyright
violation by mistake.".
See the subtle difference?  EXPORT_GPL is here to _help_ proprietary
driver authors.  Your lawyers should _love_ it and skin you alive if
you try to get around it.
