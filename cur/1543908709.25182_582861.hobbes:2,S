This only affects signalfd and so the core change seems ok vs status quo.
I think it would be better overall not to have anyone like signalfd calling
dequeue_signal in its current form at all.  (The function is too much an
internal piece of the core signals code.  The SIGNAL_STOP_DEQUEUED code
applying for signalfd calls is probably another problem, for example.)
Thanks,
Roland
