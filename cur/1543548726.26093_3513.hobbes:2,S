LD_RFLAG was obviously intended to be extra ld flags but only when
doing "ld -r".  Nothing in the standard tarball sets LD_RFLAG so it
would have to be manually set by a user.  Less than half of the
occurrences of $(LD) -r include $(LD_RFLAG) so its use (if any) is very
inconsistent.
Remove all occurrences of LD_RFLAG.  If anybody complains then we put
it back in but do it consistently this time, on all occurrences of
$(LD) -r.
