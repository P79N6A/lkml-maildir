I have proposed it.  I think ia64 already does that.
It has been pointed that the PowerPC kernel occasionally runs
with the mmu turned off. So it is not a technique the is 100%
portable.

You don't need anything fancy except to build the page tables
during bootup.  However there are a few potential gotchas
with respect to using large pages, that can give 4MiB or
greater alignment restrictions on the kernel.  Code wise
the gotcha is moving the kernel's .text section into what
is essentially the vmalloc portion of the address space.
For x86_64 the kernels virtual address is already decoupled from the
physical addresses, so it is probably easier.
Most of this just results in easier management between the pieces.
Which is a good thing.  However at the moment I don't think it
simplifies any of the core problems.  I still need to reserve
a large hunk of physical address space early on before any
DMA transactions are setup to hold the new kernel.
So while I am happy to see patches that improve this I don't
actually care right now.
