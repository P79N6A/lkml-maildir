Hmm.  The patch had a couple of hard coded assumptions about the
configuration (using ACPI etc), but I don't think it was significant
enough to break anything.  You have a UP board and a K7 processor
so my removal of set_cpus_allowed that should not affect anything.
But you are using an SMP kernel or at least the apic support.
Are you using ACPI poweroff?
How does the kernel shutdown fail?
