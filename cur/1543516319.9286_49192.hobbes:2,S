Hi,
What do you mean "fine"? It doesn't work at all (the ramdisk) in 2.3.28.
You did mke2fs /dev/ram0 and then mounted the filesystem which is why it
worked but if you unmount it and mount it again you will see that all the
files (did you have any?) will have their data zeroed. This is a bug
probably in block_read_full_page() but I don't understand it will enough
(yet) to fix it. I have been struggling with this bug for 3 evenings now
(1 hour a day, i.e.)
(I admit I did not try Ingo's patch, perhaps it fixes the ramdisk
problem?)
Regards,
