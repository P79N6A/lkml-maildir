Ah - but time is cheap as dirt, and scales like the common cold virus.
That makes it sinfully attractive for secondary affect placement cache
hints like this.
What else would you suggest?
Same question applies, I suppose, to my zonelist caching patch that is
sitting in your *-mm patch stack, where you also had doubts about using
wall clock time to decay the fullnode hints.
