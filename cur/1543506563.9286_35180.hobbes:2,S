For now change this....
#define HPT366_ALLOW_ATA66_4            1
to
#define HPT366_ALLOW_ATA66_4            0
It appears to be a timing issue or I have not figured out if there needs
to leading IRQs generate or what.
I have a Katina 13.6GB Test Drive from quantum.
The original pci card from HighPoint got it up and near 20MB/sec and a
little dorking around in the procfs, I got it to jump to 33MB/sec.
I for got to mention that I did not write down what I was trying and got
distracted......I base this on a 64MB transfer 1.93 secs.
Regardless, modify the code and it should go fine.
Expect about 17MB/sec in UDMA mode 3.
