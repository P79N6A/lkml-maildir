Actually in this case if section size is zero, linker does not even
output that section and simply gets rid of it. What is left behind is
just the symbols (which were supposed to be section relative) and linker
just makes those symbols as absolute symbols. Absolute symbols are not 
to be relocated so patch just filters out those symbols and they don't
get relocated. So I am not sure where can I check the section size?
One other possible solution is that kernel code is written carefully 
so that we don't run into such problems even if absolute symbols don't
get relocated. For example, if there are two symbols A and B denoting
section start and end, always check if (A<B) before doing anything. Also
make sure that one is not trying to handle multiple sections at the same
time. For example, if A and B represents start and end for section 1
and C and D represent start and end for section 2 then one wants to 
free memory between A and D , then it should be done in two steps.
if (A<B)
	free_memory(A,B)
if (C<D)
	free_memory(C,D)
So this code will become safe even if symbols for empty sections become
absolute.  
But this looks to be very awkward solution.
Thanks
