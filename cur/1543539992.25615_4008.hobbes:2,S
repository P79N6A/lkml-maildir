Subject: 2.4.0-test4 Out Of Memory ?!

	In part of my mission to figure out where the heck some of the memory
problems I've been having are coming from, I compiled a 2.4.0-test4 kernel
tonight.  (Actually, I've compiled a lot of kernels tonight.  But 2.4.0 
was the only one where I saw this problem.)  I did the usual, ran lilo, 
and rebooted, and got:
Uncompressing linux...
Booting linux...
	Out of memory
-- System halted.
	This is all I ever get when I try to boot this kernel.  The machine
has 224M of memory in it, so somehow I doubt it's out of memory.  
Machine specs:  AMD K6-2/450, Asus P5A Motherboard, 128M memory, sym53c8xx
SCSI card, booting off an IDE hard drive, running SuSE 6.2.  
The memory in the system is brand new, I bought it because I'd been having some
weird memory problems under 2.2.x, and I just figured it was bad memory.  
(Getting bus errors in netscape whenever it's memory spikes, if I try to create
a large image in gimp, gimp crashes, SIGILLs and SIGBUSes while compiling 
large apps.)  I'm seeing the exact same behavior with the new memory, however,
so I started looking for other causes.  Anyone have suggestions?  I've also 
attached my kernel config below.
