I have noticed that nanosleep() on 2.6.14-rt9 built with real-time
options listed at bottom of this page has unexpected behavior.  In
2.6.13-RC4-RT53 if  one called
nanosleep(20msec)
than actual sleep durations were very close to 20msec. (average  number
over 1 million samples yielded  20.008msec with minimum of  20.007msec
and maximum of 20.060 msec).
(2.6.13-RC4-RT53 nanosleep(20msec) histogram can be viewed at:
http://www.atl.external.lmco.com/projects/QoS/compare/j_data/linux/2.6.13-RC4-RT-53-07/basement_prio_95_noload_with_chrt_on_pid_8_to_p97_20msec.out.png
with 2.6.14-rt9, nanosleep(20msec) returns average sleep interval of 21 
msec.
Is the previously seen behavior in 2.6.13-RC4-RT-53-07 possible now 
under latest kernels?
