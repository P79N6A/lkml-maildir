Hello,
I've been trying to use the utf8/unicode functions to make some charset
conversions. (And since your name was conveniently located at the top of
the source file ... :)
utf8_mbstowcs fails on the following byte sequence:
c3  a5  c3  a4  c3  b6
(utf8 form of "åäö", or 0x00e5 0x00e4 0x00f6)
op is a __u16 *, not a __u8 * as ip, but still ip and op is advanced the
same value. I believe the following is correct since utf8_mbtowc only
writes one 2-byte character.

Do you agree?
I suppose something like (size >> 1) is more in line with the rest of the
else ...
