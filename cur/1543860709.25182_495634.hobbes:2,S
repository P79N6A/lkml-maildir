If NTP_INTERVAL_FREQ is different then HZ, then tick_nsec still has a
different meaning then (current_tick_length() >> TICK_LENGTH_SHIFT).
So since tick_nsec is still used in quite a few places, so I'm hesitant
to pull it.

Wait, so you're suggesting NTP_INTERVAL_FREQ be a dynamic variable
instead of a constant? Curious, could you give a bit more detail on why?

I don't follow this at all. clocksources do store their own frequency
(via mult/shift). Could you explain?
thanks
