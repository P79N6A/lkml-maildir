Dunno where the signed int for nlink_t did come from.  The original idea
was to avoid pointless creativity and choose data types to match IRIX
rsp. the MIPS psABI.  As using a signed type didn't create any visible
problems so far this never got noticed until Jamie Lokier mailed me last
week.  I now changed the definition to unsigned long for the 32-bit
kernel and unsigned int for the 64-bit kernel.
