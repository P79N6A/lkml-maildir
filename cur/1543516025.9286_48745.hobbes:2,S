Hi Manfred,
Could it be possible for you to run benchmarks against O/Ses we have
access to the source code instead of binary-only available ones. This
would allow to learn a lot better from the differences. For example
FreeBSD is as simple as Redhat to install and a base system will consume
far less disk space than NT.
Basically I an not interested at all by your benchmarks for the reasons my
personnal box has only free O/Ses installed.
May-be you will reply me that Linux is mostly competing against NT
nowadays. Anyway, ignoring other free O/Ses seems to me scornfully 
given the synergy that existed and still exists in some places. 
Gérard.
