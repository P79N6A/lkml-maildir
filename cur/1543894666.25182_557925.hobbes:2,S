But that begs the question: How do you know what has been modified so
you can revert the modifications?  There won't necessarily be any
indication of which files have been modified.
So I think Dmitry's point is valid.  Don't you need to go upstream at
least far enough to verify that you have unmodified code?
And how does the copyright work for kernel patches?  Consider a dual
licensed (i.e. anything beyond GPLv2 only) file.  Someone supplies
patches to Linus, he applies them, the resulting file is distributed
with the kernel as GPLv2.  What precisely has to happen for someone
to get that same file with equivalent patches applied that can be
distributed with the original dual license?
Somehow it seems to me that Linus would have to take the dual licensed
files from his kernel repository and copy them to a separate archive
and people would have to copy from there to keep the dual license.
Aren't the files you extract from a linux tarball only licensed to you
under the terms of GPLv2?
