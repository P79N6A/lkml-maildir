> Hi all,

> Changes since 20090121:
This kernel instantly reboots after being booted on the x200.
With 20090121 it booted, but suspend is still broken.
I'm back on 2.6.28-rc9-wl-denkbrett-24896-gf4f5c96, which almost
always suspends and wakes up: After some days of suspend/wakeup
this kernel also freezes.
I suspect there's more than one bug in the suspend code.
Sincerly,
Nico
