No. See diff-tree output and
http://pasky.or.cz/~pasky/dev/git/gitdiff-do
 for how it's done.
Basically, you just take the two trees and compare them linearily (do a
normal diff on them, essentialy). Then the differences you spot this way
are everything what needs to appear in the patch.

Actually, this could be possible too I think. We will have to make
diff-tree two-pass, but it is already so blinding fast that I guess that
doesn't hurt too much. I might try to get my hands on that.
