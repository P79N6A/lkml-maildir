With all this discussion about updatedb and locate and such, I thought
I'd do a Google search, (considering I've never heard of locate before
but I've seen updatedb here and there in ps lists) and I found this:
http://www.linux.com/articles/114029
That page mentions something called "rlocate", which seems to provide
some sort of almost-real-time mechanism, although the method it does
so bothers me -- it uses a 2.6 kernel module AND a userspace daemon.
And from what I can tell, there's no indication that this almost
"real-time" (--I see mentions of a 2 second lag--) system
replaces/eliminates updatedb in any way, shape, or form.

 - Source Forge Project Summary
The last release also appears a bit dated on sourceforge... release
0.4.0 on 2006-01-15.
Just thought I'd mention it.
