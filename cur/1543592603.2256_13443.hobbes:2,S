That seems to be partially true, if I start just the same comilation when
the first finishes, it behaves like preivous, in the moment the new gcc
needs swap the old swap gets freed, but not the in-core cache, so if I choose
carefully the number of 'puts' lines to stress my system just to the
border, I can't do two times the same 'gcc tst.c'.
