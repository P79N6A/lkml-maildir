Well, that's exactly for this that I formulated the proposal. A
CPU-intensive application which benefits from the cache would better
choose to run on HT pairs. A network-hungry application will prefer
running on only one sibling of each HT pair, and probably one process
per core, particularly when each core receives one NIC's interrupt.
A memory bandwidth intensive application will choose to run on a
single NUMA node, etc... So either the application can choose this
itself from its understanding of the CPU layout, or it can ask the
system "hey, I'd like this type of workload, how many process should
I start, and where should I bind them ?". I agree that the later
seems more portable and puts less burden on the application.
Regards,
Willy
