hm, the two problems might be related. Could you try v17 perhaps? In v18 
i have 'unified' all the sched.c's between the various kernel releases, 
maybe that brought in something unexpected on 2.6.20.14. (perhaps try 
v2.6.21.5 based cfs too?)

could you send me the file the cfs-debug-info.sh script produced. You 
can pick the script up from:
  
http://people.redhat.com/mingo/cfs-scheduler/tools/cfs-debug-info.sh
(i'd suggest to send it in private mail, output is large and detailed. 
If your kernel has no /proc/config.gz then please send me your .config 
file too.)
