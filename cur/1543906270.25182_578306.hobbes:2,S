The problem with #error is that it would cause compile-time
regressions. I assume that e.g. alpha supports building SMP
kernels, but #error would prevent that.
Thus I opted to fix the UP case while leaving the SMP case
unchanged. Actually I think the SMP case should be a BUG()
rather than -ENOSYS, but that's a different issue from the
UP case which I really do want to see fixed.
