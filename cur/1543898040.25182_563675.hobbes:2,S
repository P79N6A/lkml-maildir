No, mingming and I both work off of the patch queue (which is also
stored in git).  So what mingming was asking for exactly was just
posting the incremental patches and tagging them appropriately to
avoid confusion.
I tried building the patch queue earlier in the week and it there were
multiple oops/panics as I ran things through various regression tests,
but that may have been fixed since (the tree was broken over the
weekend and I may have grabbed a broken patch series) or it may have
been a screw up on my part feeding them into our testing grid.  I
haven't had time to try again this week, but I'll try to put together
a new tested ext4 patchset over the weekend.

I don't think we have a problem here.  What we have now is fine, and
it was just people kvetching that Amit reposted patches that were
already in -mm and ext4.
In any case, the plan is to push all of the core bits into Linus tree
for 2.6.22 once it opens up, which should be Real Soon Now, it looks
like.
