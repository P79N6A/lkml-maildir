2.4.29 is a pretty old kernel.
If you want to work on 2.4.x, then work against the latest version -
2.4.32 currently.
Even better is to work on 2.6.x instead (or both 2.6 & 2.4), and if
you do you should generally send patches against latest Linus kernel -
currently that's 2.6.15-rc5-git1
Working against an old kernel like 2.4.29 is often a waste of time
since whatever you are trying to fix may very well already be fixed in
a newer kernel (something you should at the very least check), so by
working against the latest kernel you save both your own and everyone
elses time.
Anyway, a few comments below.

Why are you changing the type of waitpid_result ?

Please don't name variables all upper case, that's how we name
constants (#define's).

You changed MAX_KMOD_CONCURRENT from a constant to a variable above,
but you never assign a value to it, so here you are comparing i to an
uninitialized variable, not good.

why multiply by two and add 1 here?

Ehh, the function returns an int, but you just changed the type of
waitpid_result to pid_t above...
