It does, no (build) regressions.  BTW, tree is not far from allmodconfig
buildable on a bunch of targets now - yesterday pile of fixes was about
half of the set needed for that.  Most of the remaining stuff is for
m68k (and applies both to Linus' tree and m68k CVS); I'll send that today
and if Geert ACKs them, we will be _very_ close to having 2.6.13 build
out of the box on the following set:
alpha, amd64, arm (RPC and versatile being tracked), i386, ia64, m32r,
m68k (!SUN3), ppc (6xx, 44x, chestnut being tracked), ppc64, sparc,
sparc64, s390, s390x, uml-i386, uml-amd64.
All of these - with allmodconfig, alpha, amd64 and i386 being tracked
separately as SMP and UP.  Missing targets:
	frv: need newer toolchain on build box
	mips, parisc: need out-of-tree patches
	v850, m68knommu: gcc gives ICE on attempt to build cross-toolchain
	h8300: binutils in FC4 doesn't know what to do with that target,
have not tried that on sarge yet.
	sh, sh64: need kernel headers that would make glibc happy enough
to build libc headers for that puppy; I don't have them
	cris, xtensa: haven't looked into those
	arm26: needs gcc3 since gcc4 had dropped that target; I might take
a look into that on a sarge-based build box someday.
sun3 is seriously broken and I doubt that we'll see any takers for testing
2.6 on those anyway ;-)
A bunch of arm and ppc subarchitectures are not covered yet - I can add those
to build setup, just give me a list in order of preference.  Or ask me how
to set up a cross-build farm of your own...
