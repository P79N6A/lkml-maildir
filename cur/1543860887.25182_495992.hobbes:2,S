They can. Hey, it's not perfect but who expects FAT/SMB to be "perfect" anyway?

hmm, checking iunique(), ino_t, __kernel_ino_t... I see. Pity. So at
some point in time we may need a sort of "ino64" mount option to be
able to switch to a 64 bit number space on mount basis. Or (conversely)
refuse to mount without that option if we know there are >32 bit st_ino
out there. And invent iunique64() and use that when "ino64" specified
for FAT/SMB/...  when those filesystems haven't been replaced by a
successor by that time.
At that time probably all programs are either compiled with
-D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 (most already are because of files bigger than 2G)
or completely 64 bit.
