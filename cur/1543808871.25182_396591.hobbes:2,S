2.6.16-rc3.

Yes, calibrate_migration_costs is very fast now. But it turned out that
this was just hiding the real problem: if we have CONFIG_PREEMPT disabled
the kernel gets (sometimes) unbelievably slow.
I think this happened somewhere between rc1 and rc3. Maybe Hannes knows
more exactly when this happened the first time, since I always run with
CONFIG_PREEMPT enabled.
