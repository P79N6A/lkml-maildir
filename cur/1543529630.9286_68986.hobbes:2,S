goodness, are you ever wrong. Actually there is a very strong correlation
between failed computers and the use of the mach (or OSF/1) kernel:
BBN TC2000 (they actually back-patched mach to 4.3bsd, mach was so bad)
KSR (12 Meg of OS memory on a 16-Meg COMA node is a bad idea)
NeXT
Intel Paragon
to name just a few. Mach has a way with computers, it seems.
There are lots of companies that put time and effort into OSF/1 (nee
mach) that regretted it later as well. See IBM, HP, DEC, ...
