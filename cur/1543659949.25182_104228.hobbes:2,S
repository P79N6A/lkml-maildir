It is not a magic number in net drivers. I was author of this bit, and
without it I cannot start onboard nic on IBM PC300 GL (a lot of them I
have here). Actually, to _understand_ what this bit do you just need
to look at the driver source and see _how_ it works with
A_CNF_MEDIA_10B_2 constants. More specific, it expects that there are
single bits, and before my patch A_CNF_MEDIA_10B_2 was 0x60. 0x60 is
not a single bit.
I've thought this change is obvious, and as far as I can remember
Andrew has nothing against it.
