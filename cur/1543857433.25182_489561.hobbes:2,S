BTW, I suspect front panel connectors could introduce noise too, via the
jumper cables from motherboard to the panel.

I don't know about USB 2.0, but in case of FireWire, ~4.5m long cables
are theoretically in spec too. I've got a FireWire 400 and a FireWire
800 cable this long, and both don't work very unreliable. Depending on
what's connected, they fail sooner or later. However due to how FireWire
works, this is immediately noticed as data CRC errors or bus resets.
I.e. it's nearly impossible for noisy hardware to _silently_ cause data
corruption. I would suppose USB has similar CRC checks.
Also, you mentioned that the corruption occurs systematically on certain
byte patterns. Therefore it's certainly not related to the cables.
