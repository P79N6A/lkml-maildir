Actually awk is one of the standard Single Unix Specification (version 3) 
utilities and the kernel build uses it in a number of places, such as 
arch/alpha/boot/Makefile, drivers/eisa/Makefile, scripts/ver_linux.
Your objection is a bit like saying "and don't use cat".  I'm saying don't 
call cat "gcat" when you just mean plain old cat.

Me.  Seriously.  It's on my todo list, as part of the Firmware Linux project:
http://lwn.net/Articles/215941/
Although as major projects go, it's about fifth down on the list after getting 
toybox up to speed, writing a proper bash replacement shell, getting tcc to 
build an unmodified Linux kernel, convincing the uClibc guys to HAVE ANOTHER 
RELEASE ALREADY (it's been a year and a half, I _sent_ a cake)...
Today, I'm writing a gene2fs that produces streaming output (I.E. it works 
like tar).  It's not done yet...
