Hi Dmitry,
	Today there is really no sysfs representation of acpi devices apart from
the acpi namespace representation. Evaluating acpi namespaces's _EJ0 method won't help,
as we need acpi device and all its child devices to be removed as part of the eject.
Also for there is no 1:1 maping of acpi devices to pci devices to consider eject to be
part of the pci devices.
Hence the best solution for now is to echo ACPI full path name of the device to be
ejected onto the eject file and the code will make sure that the device supports _EJx method before actuall removing the device.
thanks,
Anil
