Subject: [PATCH] NFSv4: rpc_mkpipe creating socket inodes w/out sk buffers.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

rpc_mkpipe sets the S_IFSOCK mode bit when it creates a
inode but does not create a true socket inode. So when other parts
of the kernel (i.e. the SELinux code in the-mm kernel) use
S_ISSOCK() to see if the inode is a socket, the macro returns true,
but the expected socket inode container structure is really
an rpc_inode container which obviously causes problems...
This patch simply change the S_IFSOCK mode bit to
S_IFIFO which eliminates the problem.

This patch stop rpc_mkpipe from create S_IFSOCK nodes what don't 
have associated sk buffers attached (which causes SELinux to oops
during NFSv4 mounts). Instead the S_IFIFO mode bit is set which
probably make more sense and seems to work just fine during
my connectathon and fsx testing...
