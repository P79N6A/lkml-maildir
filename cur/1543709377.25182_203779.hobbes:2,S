Agreed, it is *really* ugly.
I've decided to alter the synclink drivers to
work with and without the new assertion. That
way, our customers can download updated
drivers from our web site which will work
with any 2.6 kernel.
Removing the assertion fixes things for the
other drivers starting with kernel 2.6.5
