It probably can only be done at *config time (and probably *should* only 
be done at *config time); but it seems like it would be a 
straightforward addition to Kconfig to look in the environment for 
variables named CONFIG_* just like it'd look in an old config file.
That would definitely resolve a lot of issues.
