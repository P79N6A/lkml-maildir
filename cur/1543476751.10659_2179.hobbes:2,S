First we disable DMA by default on IDE chipsets back in August, and now we
think of disabling dsc_overlap.. which will just take away most of my work
on optimizing the ide-tape driver for no good reason.
That's not the way to solve problems. We must first diagnose and fully
understand the real cause of a problem. Only then we might try to fix it.
