I think that bit is actually intentional since __preempt_spin_lock is also 
marked __sched so that it'll get charged as a scheduling function.

I think cpu_relax() (or some other primitive) should actually take a 
parameter, this will allow for us to use monitor/mwait on i386 too so 
that in cases where we're spinning waiting on memory modify we could do 
something akin to the following;
while (spin_is_locked(lock))
	cpu_relax(lock);
Although there are wakeup latencies when using monitor/mwait for such, 
some cases such as above should be ok (although there are implementation 
details such as the cost of a monitor operation on things like spin 
unlock paths). I believe such an API modification would be beneficiel for 
you too. What do others think?
Thanks,
	Zwane
