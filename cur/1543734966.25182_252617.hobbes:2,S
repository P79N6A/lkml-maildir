not yet - i've coded it up today. Perhaps the lowlatency audio folks
(who are most interested in BKL-latency removal) could report some
numbers?
but as i've replied to Linus too, i believe that _if_ the context-switch
rate goes up then some piece of code uses the BKL way too often! So
having a semaphore here might in fact help fixing those rare cases.

yeah, agreed, will do.
