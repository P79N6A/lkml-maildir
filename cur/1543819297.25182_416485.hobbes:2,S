Interesting. Considering the minimal .config, where I
haven't experienced this problem over a week uptime,
also having CFQ as the default elevator, do you still
believe CFQ is involved? (I guess if CFQ could be
influenced by other kernel configurations, then
perhaps another elevator might help. It's worth
trying.)
I'm on 2.6.16.7 full config now. I'll try a few
things, if I were to observe problems:
1. Use deadline elevator
2. Start eliminating a few kernel configurations to
narrow it down
Thanks
