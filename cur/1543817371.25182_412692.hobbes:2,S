Dear Jens Axboe,
I have done this test as your request but it still there.
But more less.
I have modify  #define ARCMSR_MAX_XFER_SECTORS  4096 => 512.
It had worked all of this morning on bonnie++ , iometer and my copy/compare 
test script.
All machines in my lab.do not have this message again.
Best Regards
Erich Chen
