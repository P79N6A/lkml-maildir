Subject: [PATCH 7/12] relayfs: add support for relay files in other filesystems
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/11/11/143

This patch adds a couple of callback functions that allow a client to
hook into relay_open()/close() and supply the files that will be used
to represent the channel buffers; the default implementation if no
callbacks are defined is to create the files in relayfs.  This is to
support the creation and use of relay files in other filesystems such
as debugfs, as implied by the fact that relayfs_file_operations are
exported.
