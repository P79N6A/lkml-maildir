No the problem is to know if the lock was really taken. SWAP_AGAIN could 
mean that page_lock_anon_vma failed.
Also the page may be freed while it is being processes. In that case 
remove_migration_ptes may not find the mapping and may not unlock the 
anon_vma.

Information that indicates that the anon_vma lock was taken.
