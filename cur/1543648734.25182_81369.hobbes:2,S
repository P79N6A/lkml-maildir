Don't know where you got your figures from but I've yet to see a single
complete desktop computer based on ix86 which ships with 1000TX. Sure
one can get the motherboards on the market and then there are also
Apples which have had it for quite some time now, but "majority" is this
not... maybe a good case for a different kind of minority report....
