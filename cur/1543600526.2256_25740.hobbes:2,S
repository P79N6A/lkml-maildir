Eh? "0" is a signed integer constant. So your comparisons force promotion
to int when x is smaller size. I'm not sure what type 
     "unsigned foo - signed int"
would have either!  It seems to me that you are making things very
murky, which is precisely what you want to avoid.

No parsum.

You can't take care of it. A macro is always vulnerable to name
clashes.
