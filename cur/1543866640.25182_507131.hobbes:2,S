Sorry. I used the poor 'reply'.

Thanks for your work. And you are right.
I think the OLD /proc API which I used in my module confused my eyes.
I got completely lost by that. OLD /proc API is very bad, isn't it?
BTW, can you tell me which way do you use to exchange information
between user-space and kernel-space when debugging the kernel?
Thanks again! And have a nice day!
