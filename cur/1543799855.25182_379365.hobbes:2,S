Did you use the nVidia module? Several people reported machine hangs when
doing the vt <-> X switching. This, however, should be fixed with the latest
drivers.
I had the same problem some time ago. Though I knew a have reached a console
where I was logged in the keyboard seems to deny any service when coming from X.
Since i upgraded X to some CVS version and the nVidia driver 8174 (8178 working
as well) anything is OK.
