Subject: [PATCH] remove name length check in a workqueue
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Ingo,
This has been in the workqueue code in day one, for no real reason that
I can see.  We just tripped over it in SCSI because the fibre channel
transport class creates one workqueue per host with the name scsi_wq_%d
which trips this after we get to 100.  Unfortunately we just came across
someone with > 100 host adapters ...
I think the solution is just to get rid of the artificial limit.
James
