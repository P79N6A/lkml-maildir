Hi,
I tried unplugging/plugging the cable a few times along with ifup and 
ifdown a few times in different variations. It didnt seem to do much, 
one interesting thing that I noticed was that the Windows XP host that 
this laptop was connected to with a crossover cable during the testing 
reported the link as being down when the NIC was ifup'ed and vice versa.
After being bored with ifup/down and cable pulling I tried some 
modprobe/rmmod as well. This proptly hosed the system, the "ifconfig 
eth0 down" command is frozen, unkillable and consumes 100% CPU right 
now. ifconfig on another console to check if the card "is still there" 
also froze. Well, at least the network led woke up, its on constantly 
right now :-)
Ideas?
//David
PS
With the tg3 driver the card is reported as a 33Mhz PCI card, with the 
bcm5700 it's reported as a 66Mhz PCI card, could this make a 
difference?
