I'm not sure if we're at the source of the problem. I mean - it should be 
possible to set a minimum length as well, so just touching a key won't be 
accepted. I beleive this'll remove most of the falsly detected dtmf signals 
as well, as noone really holds the same tone for a long time while speaking
