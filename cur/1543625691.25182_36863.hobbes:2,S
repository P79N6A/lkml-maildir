The version in the kernel is based on the latest dm9xs.c driver, but is 
called dmfe.c.  I have no idea why Davicom decided to rename the driver 
for 2.4.

Correct.

The version in the kernel is based on the latest dm9xs.c driver, but
contains some fixes that are not present in Davicom's driver.  I recommend
using the one included with the Linux kernel.
As Alan mentioned, you can also use the tulip driver with this card since
it is (yet) a(nother) tulip clone.  With your card you will probably get
better tx performance using the tulip driver at the moment.
