It's unclear whether distributing not GPL compatible modules is legal
at all.
And they are definitely not "very good reasons" for doing anything in 
the kernel.

Unmaintained code in the kernel has a realistic chance of being usable 
for 5 years.
Unmaintained external code is quite likely to be unusable after
at most one year.

Let's fix the problems, not work around them.
There is a conflict between getting code included and ensuring some 
minimum quality of the kernel, but in many cases we could try better.
And when there's a good reason for a kernel policy, then code that
violates this policy is not a "very good reason" for anything.

That's their fault, and definitely not a "very good reason" for making 
life easier for them.
