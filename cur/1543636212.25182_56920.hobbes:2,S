   close() checking is not about physical disk guarantees. It's about more
   basic "I/O completed". In some future Linux only close() might tell you
   about some kinds of I/O error. The fact it doesn't do it now is no
   excuse for sloppy programming
Practice dictates that if you make close() return error values
your whole system will blow up.  Try it out for yourself.
I can tell you of at least 1 app that is going to explode :-)
I believe Linus mentioned way back when that this is a "shall not"
when we had similar problems with NFS returning errors from close().
