Let me first point out, I have no official connection to the  writing of 
this driver.  It's a big company :)  I'm most interested in this because 
I have an old ServeRAID card at home.
I know that none of the real authors is actively working on fixing this. 
  Can this be accepted as a band-aid until the maintainers decide to 
maintain a 2.5 driver, or are we pushing authors to rewrite drivers 
which don't use the new DMA scheme?
