I have noticed with my current kernel that after the system is idle for 
a while, say 10 hours or
so, that everything seems to be swapped out to disk. So when I come in 
the next morning
it starts swapping everything like crazy in from disk. Is this a known 
characteristic of the
VM. I seem to remember this with all 2.4 kernels tried to date.
Whats the point of swapping out to disk in circumstances like this?
Currently I am using 2.4.18-rc2-ac2, with apps like mozilla, dozen 
xterms, xemacs, staroffice etc.
Cheers,
Tony.
