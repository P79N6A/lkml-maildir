if you are optimizing throughput rather than latency, then you let
things get to disk whenever they get there, and you let the app hang
while it waits. A mailer processing many requests in parallel might find
30 seconds of latency to be just fine but a database might find 3
seconds of latency to be too much. (I make up these examples, mailer
programmers please correct me.)

No, that is not when you do it.
