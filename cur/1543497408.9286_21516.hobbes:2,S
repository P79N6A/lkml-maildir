Subject: Large tmp files, async flush and still lots of I/O?

I am seeing large amounts of disk I/O from a program that actually writes
and reads and afterwards deletes a temporary file. If the temporary
file is just a few megabytes, nearly no disk I/O happens. As soon as
the problem set gets larger to say several 30 or 50 megabytes the disk
I/O to the temporary file starts to appear. The file itself as well as
the program fits well into memory, I tried a machine with 512 MB RAM.
I would believe that due to the larger size the file does stay in
existance longer and an async write starts. But this does not appear to
stop upon deleting the file, I get more the impression the deletion gets
delayed as soon as the write is started. Is there some way to inhibit
this behaviour? Preferable I would like to see no I/O at all if the file
fits into memory.
