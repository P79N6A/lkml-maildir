Actually, it's very similar to the ones you had earlier - the backtrace is
different, but it's the same thing again:
	ecx: 5944f160   edx: d944f160
that's a doubly-linked list, and the two values _should_ be the same, I
bet.
Except one of them has the high bit clear, and when following the bogus
pointer, you get a page fault.
I think the second one (the "kernel bug in mmap.c" one) is just a result
of the first oops one leaving the mm lists in a bad state and map_count
being off as a result, or something like that.
