The problem is not this, but structure alignment and copy_[to|from]_user
operations. This approach, although it's my preferred one (due to being
self-contained), requires synchronization between kernel and utility, and
this sometimes is not always true.
Anyhow, I still prefer this approach over the "tons of different ioctl's"
one. I'd like to get the opinion of the community though (especially
Alan).
Later,
Ivan
