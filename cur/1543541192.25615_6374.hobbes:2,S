True.

Oh yes you do, otherwise the PowerPC won't activate the card properly, this
may be a problem with the PPC arch rather that the driver though.

On the list

Yep,

The new pci api will clean up a lot of things, most of the code is in there
for various reasons, none of which are probably valid anymore.

Jeff, I know you've taken on the responsibility for the ethernet drivers,
and approve of what Arnaldo is doing, but it would have been nice to review
the changes before they were posted to the mailing list. I'm working through
some issues with the driver on certain machines at the moment and when this
is fixed I was going to update the driver with the new pci api's, also the
driver may need slight mods to work with the new cardbus version of the
chipset which I was also going to include.
