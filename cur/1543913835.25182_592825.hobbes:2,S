Of course boundless allocations from interrupt / reclaim context will 
ultimately crash the system. To fix that you need to stop the networking 
layer from performing these.

The patch is obviously correct because it provides memory where we used to

So far our experience has just been the opposite and Peter's other patches 
demonstrate the same. Dirty limits make the VM stable and increase I/O 
performance.
