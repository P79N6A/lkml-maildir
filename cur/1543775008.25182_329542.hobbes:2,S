It's working fine now - switching back and forth between graphical mode
and text console (which works with or with out the shift key B-)  and no
more flooding of BUG: scheduling with irqsw disabled in dmesg. I did
notice that 50-24 kernal was hard locked up when I came in this morning.
SysRq-B would not reboot it and pinging from another machine said it
was down. I went ahead and booted up another kernel and saw the message
about 50-30 so I built that and that is what I am running on now. I really
like using it because X works much better at rendering the screen and
screen animations are really smooth. (this is on a 2GHz P4 with 1Gb RAM)
