Your assumption that reverting the 
-       might_sleep_if(wait);
+       if (wait)
+               cond_resched();
change does solve the problem is correct. Looking at the diffs its the
only change which can have any influence at this point.
Mats. I don't understand why this did not work for you. The change has
to be reverted to the original line "might_sleep_if(wait)" !
Scheduling in this init stage causes the breakage. 
might_sleep_if() is a nop and only does a state check when compiled with
CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK_SLEEP=y, but it does neither sleep nor schedule. 
It then works so far except that it kills the wrong process (sshd), but
I did expect that from the previous experience. 
There is no multi kill or other strange things happening. I tested it
with hackbench and the real application _after_ adding my "whom to kill
patch" on top.
Looks much better now. 
Can you agree to add the selection patch, which takes the multi child
forking process into account ? I don't explain again why it makes
sense :)
