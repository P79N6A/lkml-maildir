In the cobalt days we had a parallel port connected panel with an LCD (2
lines x 16 characters) 6 buttons (up, down, left, right, select, enter) and
LEDs (Disk, network activity, network link, 100 MB status, and web activity
[required a hacked apache, but it was cute]).
Our RaQXTR boxes had even more - and they were all software programmable.
