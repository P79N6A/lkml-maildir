Why does the sparc(32) spring to mind, in particular?
It is likely to be in better shape than sh or mips.
I'm injured (not that anyone cares, but just for the record).
I agree with Andrew on the whole though. More, it's not about
being first tier architecture, or a second tier architecture.
It's about being up to date. I know at least one first tier
architecture which is fond of taking removed features and
reimplementing them inder arch/foo, inventing wheels (sometimes
square) and generally being not up to date.
