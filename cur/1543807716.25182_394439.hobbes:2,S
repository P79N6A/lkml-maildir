I also tried VMWare 5.5 that emulated PIIX4. It works if I only put 
ata_piix driver in. With the same kernel that Qemu gets the error, 
VMWare gets another oops during generic ide initialisation. I relooked 
and found that I have both generic PCI ide and generic ISA ide drivers 
compiled in, so I disabled them and it works using ata_piix (with PATA 
and ATAPI enabled). Even ATAPI cdrom worked as the root partition.
But, the different oops that I got in vmware with generic ide:
