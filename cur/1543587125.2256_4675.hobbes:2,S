I believe so, at least in generic code.
In architecture specific code (non-i386) it is usually sufficient just to do
one put_user/get_user/copy_from_user and then do the rest of
__put_user/__get_user etc. from nearby area (<4K is safe e.g. on sparc) and
some architectures don't care at all, because verify_area is a noop
(sparc64).
