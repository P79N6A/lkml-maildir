Subject: [PATCH 2.6.9-rc2 0/2] enhanced accounting data collection
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This is an effort of providing an enhanced accounting data collection.
It is intended to offer common data collection method for various
accounting packages including BSD accouting, ELSA, CSA, and any other
acct packages that favor a common layer of data collection, separated
from data presentation layer and management of process groups layer.
This patchset consists of two parts: acct_io and acct_mm as we
identified useful spots for improved data collection in the area
of IO and MM.
This patchset is to replace the previously submitted CSA patchset
of four. The CSA kernel module is a standalone module. The csa_eop
patch was to provide a hook for end-of-process handling and that
can be considered separately unless there is enough common interest.
Now that the patchset is down to IO and MM, i hope it is more
appealing :)
Comments?
