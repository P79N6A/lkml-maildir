I wonder if this the same problem that prevents resume-from-ram
from working on my system when I use an older hard drive,
rather than the newer model that came installed (notebook)..
Whenever resume fails, the hard drive light is on solid
and the system is unresponsive.  And the backlight is off so no
debug info available (no serial ports, either).
Could be.. could be.
Cheers
