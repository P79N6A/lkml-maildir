 What about errors?
 "set di 200000" might fail for lots of reasons.

 it doesn't, since you didn't tryed to make error handling. every thing can 
fail - this is control of mechanics - and it fails often and for a lot of 
reasons. Put here error handling (write(struct whatever) has to return 
another struct whatever2 filled with error description) and thread-safeness. 
Pluss some controllers do support multi-dimensional movements "start 
x,y,z,etc" - and you might have _several_ error structs. Atomicity is 
important for multi-dimensional moves too - move on given axes starts with 
single command. 
 hu? 
 I do not see much point in renaming ioctl() to write() all over the place - 
at least when people see ioctl() they understand that it is not standard 
functionality. write() will for sure confuse a lot of people. 
 --- with respect. best regards.
