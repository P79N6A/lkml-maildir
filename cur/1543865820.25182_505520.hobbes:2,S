BIOS didn't say anything at all.

BIST is supposed to terminate before, say the OS kernel is loaded ? or
does it mean that it  can keep running still ?

Thanks a lot for the valuable info. I had not ruled out the option
that it could be broken.
I will try the device in the other OS also, to confirm this. Will post
the status after that.
But most probably as you said, could be broken.
