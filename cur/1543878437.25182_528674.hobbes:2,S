Ok, I can't reproduce any bad interactivity here with that workload
either with SMP or UP kernel.  That said however, gzip does attain
interactive status, which it really should not - that gives it an unfair
advantage over it's peers.
With my throttled tree, it gets pushed back down to where it belongs.
I'm going to try to tighten the tolerance on behavior to evict the
riffraff who don't really belong in the elite interactive club sooner,
and guarantee that even fast/light tasks can't dominate the CPU without
paying heavily.
(to close the many fast/light tasks wakeup scenario that the "untested"
patch someone mentioned did, but was shown to be too painful to bare).
