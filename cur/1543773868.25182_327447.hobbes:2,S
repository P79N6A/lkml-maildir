Existence of ugly code is not an excuse to add more.
We have to maintain said ugly code for decades.  Maintainability is a 
big deal when you deal with the timeframes we deal with.

This is how all Linux development is done.
The code evolves over time.
You have just described the path ReiserFS needs to take, in order to get 
this stuff into the kernel, in fact.

We care about technical merit, not some random company's financial 
solvancy.  Reiser4 has layering violations, and doesn't work with the 
current security layer.  Those are two biggies.
There is no entitlement to be merged in the upstream kernel.  If people 
don't like how the Linux kernel is managed, they are free to maintain 
their own fork.  If its better, people will use that instead.

No, they shouldn't.

Obviously.
