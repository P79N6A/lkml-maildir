No, Mike's right. If you do a make -j32 and then start up xmms, xmms seems to 
want to burn off some cpu when it first starts, and _then_ starts sleeping 
regularly; so it starts as a cpu hog for a short while and then sleeps. This 
makes is bloody hard for the scheduler to do the right thing to it since it 
gets treated as a cpu hog initially, meaning it will take forever to burn off 
that cpu time necessary when all other cpu hogs are also running.
