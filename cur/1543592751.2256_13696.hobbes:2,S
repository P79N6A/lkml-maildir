Well, since the video card only has 4Mb of memory I tried 15 bpp but then
I kept getting a kernel Opps from a function in the rivafb driver. I will
try to catch it to see an exact error but it is difficult as the Opps
eventually halts the system and the error is not capturable.

I did boot with 8 bpp and it does indeed seem to be fine. Got two correctly
colored penguin logos and system did not Opps.
BTW, when the system Opps with 15 bpp I don't see the penguin logos at all.
There is blank space at the top of the screen during booting where they
would normally be displayed but they aren't there.
With the screwed up colors (but no-Opps'ing system) at 16 bpp I do see the
two penguin logos but as I said they are various shades of blue only.

Shouldn't that indicate that the system should allocate & use mtrr registers &
memory? It does on other systems I have.
