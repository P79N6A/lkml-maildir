Paul,
This patch adds explicit checking for EEH slot isolation events into the 
PCI config space read path.  The change itself would have been minor,
except that pci config reads don't have a pointer to a struct pci_dev.
Thus, I had to restructure the eeh code to accomodate this, which
seems to be a good thing anyway, making it a tad cleaner.   This patch
presumes the earlier patches i.e. the notifier-call chain patch) have
been applied.
Please forward upstream if all's OK.
