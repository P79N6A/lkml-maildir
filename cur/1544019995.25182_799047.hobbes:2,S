Yes, I'm finding the callbacks a complicating factor, I think that we
should have instead a flag in the struct trace_event and struct tracer
telling that we don't need the context printed and the default routine
exported to tracers.
That way minimise change on the old tracers but allow new ones to use
the default context to be called from trace_event->trace() and not from
trace_event->bin().
So, to summarize, for blktrace I would use:
struct trace_event {
	.flags	= DONT_PRINT_CONTEXT | OTHER_FUTURE_FLAGS,
	.bin	= blktrace_print_bin,
	.trace	= blktrace_print_trace,
}
blktrace_print_bin(iter)
{
	full control with access to iter to get timestamp, cpu, etc
}
blktrace_print_trace(iter)
{
	print_default_context()
	print tracer specific stuff
}
Back to trying to use your patch to show the problems in the form of a
working blktrace synthesizer to use with:
cat /d/tracing/trace_pipe | blkparse -i -
