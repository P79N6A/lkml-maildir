I've thought about this, but the FS with multiple files approach
has several problems:
1. An open file descriptor no longer suffices as a user-space handle.
   This is because we don't have fd = open("%d/file",dirfd) type
   system calls.
2. A mini-fs under /proc/<pid>/<tid>/perfctr/ disappears when the
   process disappears. Currently, a process' perfctr state lives
   as long as references remains, whether via the process task_struct,
   or via some open file descriptor. One use for this is in
   remote-control applications, where it avoids enforcing
   parent/child relationships on monitor/target processes.
Going with a mini-fs is possible (though painful to implement), but
the remote-control feature would have to be constrained to a debugger
like model. In particular, the whole notion of using an fd as a handle
to a state object with its own lifetime would have to be ditched.
