The locked process still takes signals and faitfully exits when you kill
it!
Locked yes, but certainly killable and you do get that segfault instead
of system lookup ...

A DSP loop on a PII never need to be padded with NOP's due to the rdtsc!

Linux has full control over the locked process and it is completly
sandboxed!

Jupp!

This is what I'm saying!
(In my case the non locked CPU executes Matlab code in your case it
 executes audiality ...)

It is!

Nice idea!
It is a pitty that modern sound cards and modern busses are optimized
for
bandwith rather then latency. Even though the CPU can operate on a
per sample basis the sound card may deliver data in bursts of 64 samples

Exactly :-)

PS; I'm talking about matlab above, it is a great tool but I do not
    like the monopoly like situation Mathworks have ... but they
    support Linux quite nicely!
