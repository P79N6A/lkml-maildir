My first desire is to minimize chip count, which means one FPGA with as 
much of the logic in it as possible.  If we do multi-core designs, it 
would be logical to be able to reprogram each of the chips separately. 
I would bundle the PCI controller with the PROM reprogrammer and any 
other logic which doesn't change much and put the rest into the other 
chip(s).  This way, you could reprogram the core without risking the 
whole thing.

I am aware of it, but I've hesitated to even look at it.  I respect the 
author's wish to put it under a GPL-like license, and I don't want to 
"cheat".  (The issue here isn't what's legal but what's ethical. 
Companies do bad things all the time which are perfectly legal, and I 
want to avoid that.)  The author of that VGA core posted to the 
kerneltrap thread.  Perhaps I can make some sort of arrangement with 
him.  For instance, a friend of mine sold a commercial program which had 
some GPL'd components, but he first asked the authors to relicense under 
LGPL.  I'd be happy to release my improvements to any PIECES that I got 
from elsewhere, but I want to have the option of not releasing the WHOLE 
thing.
