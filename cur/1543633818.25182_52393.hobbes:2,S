I run all all of Martin's patches on my machine, and I haven't run into
any catastrophic problems (by this I mean problems that cause data loss 
though I realize that this may not be much of a standard).
I rather like the fact that Martin releases early and often... it 
usually means that I get a fix right away. I like the "release early and 
often" approach in a development kernel branch since I do not believe 
that releasing less often has any correlation to the stability of the 
product released (look at Windows :).
Martin or Jens, are there any test suites that you would like me to run?
I am currently too stupid to be able to aid in the development directly 
(lord knows i'm trying to get up to speed), but, in the meantime, I can 
test the crap out of a kernel :).
