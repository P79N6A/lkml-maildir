Hello,
  yesterday I told (in IDE thread) that BUG at rmap.c:212 is probably
already fixed by changeset 520. Unfortunately, it is not, I got it again
with BK tree. It happened again when 'ntpd' called exit() upon receiving
sigterm.
  Stack trace:
  page_remove_rmap
  zap_pte_range
  zap_pmd_range
  unmap_page_range
  exit_mmap
  mmput
  do_exit
  sys_exit
  syscall_call
If it is not known bug, I'll rebuild kernel with DEBUG_RMAP. Unfortunately
it looks like that machine must have uptime > 12hrs to trigger this. Probably
updatedb or some other task must be run to try to swap ntpd out?
                                                Best regards,
                                                    Petr Vandrovec
