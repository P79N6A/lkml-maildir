Now before moving veth1 to the new netns, we have in the container:
/sys/class/net:
lo  sit0
/sys/devices/virtual/net:
lo  sit0
and after moving veth1, we have in the container:
/sys/class/net:
lo  sit0  veth1
/sys/devices/virtual/net:
lo  sit0
In the parent network namespace, veth1 is removed from /sys/class/net
but remains in /sys/devices/virtual/net.
I'm not sure whether this is the renaming bug that Daniel Lezcano's
patch addresses.  If not (as I suspect) then that clearly needs to be
fixed.
Benjamin can you play around with this and test it with Daniel's
patch?
thanks,
