It's not. VIA is fine. It has some odd bugs WRT UDMA and funky IDE
devices, but its no more or less broken than any other chipset, especially
any of Intel's.
The PCI/sound problems affect all chipsets not just VIA.
But there are no "lack of functionality" issues with VIA chipsets at all.
If anything its Intel chipsets that lack functionality.
