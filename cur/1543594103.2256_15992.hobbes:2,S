Hi,
Is it possible to build an SMP module on a machine running a UP kernel
(or vice versa)? We of course get unresolved symbols during module load
due to the smp prefix on the ksyms, and haven't seen how to get around
it. (Defining __SMP__ does not cut it, though I believe this used to
work a while ago).
Please reply to me as well as to the list.
Thanks,
-mark
