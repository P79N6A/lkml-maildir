Please don't make this unconditional. There's no guarantee whatsoever
that the code at c000:0003 does anything useful on a laptop, and it may
actually be harmful in some cases. The sensible approach is to whitelist
it based on DMI entries or provide a sysfs attribute so userspace can
enable/disable it.
How well does this patch deal with multihead? If I have a mixed
radeon/non-radeon system, and the primary head is a non-radeon, won't
this result in the wrong card being POSTed?
