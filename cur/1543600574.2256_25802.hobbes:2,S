>Okay, I had it again today:
You need to be running with aic7xxx=verbose for these messages to be
useful.  In the 6.2.2 driver release I've turned these messages on
by default.
>Kernel was 2.4.9ac9 with (new) AIC driver 6.2.1, compiled with "Maximum
>Number of TCQ Commands per Device" set to 64.
This is 8 times the tag load the old driver defaults to.
>So I compiled the same kernel with the old AIC driver, and it works fine.
Which may be due to a lighter load on the drive.  Its hard to say without
the verbose messages and the full dmesg for the machine.  You're IBM drive
may be running the "if I miss a seek, I fall off the bus" firmware where
the bug is only triggered under high load.  Send the dmesg output and we'll
see.

This isn't true.
