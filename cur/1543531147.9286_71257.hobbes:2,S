It's worse: even without -fwritable-stings, gcc doesn't merge identical
strings properly: these strings appears 100 times in my vmlinux file.
I removed the printk from BUG, and that saved ~ 60 kB data area. I don't
know how much we could save if _all_ identical strings get merged.
Does anyone know how gcc+ld merge identical strings, and if that works if an
identical string appears in different files?
IIRC MSVC creates a special symbol for each string with an automatic name:
the mangled contents of the string.
The linker then merges the identically named symbols.
I think the linker should support that [required for certain static inline
tricks], but I don't know know if gcc uses that feature.
Btw, IIRC someone proposed to mark the .rodata section as read-only: that
won't work because the complete kernel is mapped with 4 MB pte's :-(
