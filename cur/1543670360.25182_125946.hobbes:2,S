This calls for __GFP_NORETRY.  It will disable the oom-kill and the infinite
retry in the page allocator.  So we will have:
__GFP_REPEAT:
	retry the allocation, but the caller can handle a failure.
	eg: pte_alloc_one().
	__GFP_REPEAT _may_ end up returning NULL.  It depends on the VM
	implemention - eg it would in -aa kernels.  
__GFP_NOFAIL:
	retry the allocation inifinitely, regardless of the VM implementation. 
	For jbd_kmalloc() and others.
__GFP_NORETRY:
	Don't oom-kill and don't retry.   For swapoff.
I've implemented a __GFP_REPEAT, and don't like it, because it blurs the
__GFP_REPEAT and __GFP_NOFAIL requirements.  I'll add __GFP_NORETRY and we
can then pass that into read_swap_cache_async() and handle the error.
Sound good?
