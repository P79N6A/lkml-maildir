Pardon me, but I will believe it when I see your bug reports.  All
I had been able to find on MARC was rather unimpressive; if that is
what you've found using cqual in several months...

First of all, it's nowhere near the majority of _files_.  Moreover,
the taint analysis is nowhere near "if it gives no warnings, we are
guaranteed to have no user/kernel pointer mixed".
The only way to convince anybody that it's worth the trouble is to
make your annotations available, run your stuff over the patched
tree and start posting fixes.  If it catches a lot of bugs - who
would argue against its usefulness?  If not - too bad, but then again
there would be no questions.
Neither sparse nor cqual will catch everything that could be, in theory,
automatically caught.  Same story as with optimizations - there's always
one more.
The real questions are
	a) how large subset of tree can $FOO survive?
	b) how many new bugs is $FOO catching?
	c) how much noise does $FOO produce and how hard it is to eliminate
that noise?
	d) how fast $FOO is (it _is_ important, if you hope to get a decent
code coverage, especially on non-x86 platforms).
	e) is everything needed for testing available ($FOO itself, patches
needed to use it on the tree usefully)?
And that's all that matters.  So far you said nothing on (a) or (d), had
rather unimpressive results posted on (b) and basically waved hands on (c).
Not sure about (e); are your initial annotations available for download?
