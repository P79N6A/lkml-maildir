Isn't this patch specifically for the -mm kernel and not mainline? How can 
anyone using a binary driver provide any feedback on an -mm kernel? The 
binary driver taints the kernel, so bug reports are useless.
Furthermore, if you aren't interested in debugging the kernel, why would you 
run the -mm tree or why can't you hack/patch the 8k stacks back in?
