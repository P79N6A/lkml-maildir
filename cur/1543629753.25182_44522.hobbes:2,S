Actually, I've always said that I think devfs should care about both
views. And that's why I think putting the driver tree (ala driverfs)
in devfs, and making the device-oriented part of the tree be symlinks
into the bus-oriented tree, is a good idea.

Fugly. What's wrong with readlink(2) as this "magic syscall"?
