The user has control over the running kernel, and given enough time
and clue, can circumvent any protection mechanism the vendor comes
up with. And that's a good thing IMO, unless you believe in "trusted
computing" and all those Bigbrotherisms some agencies want to put
in your machines.
So the user is running a system in some state that may or may not
resemble what the vendor shipped. When the machine crashes, the
user is free to munge the oops until it looks like a valid one.
Someone mentioned in this context that you can sign the oops - but to
do that you need a private key. And the whole point of this exercise is
that the user does not have access to that key.
So as far as support is concerned, you're back in square one.
You cannot tell a "genuine" oops produced on a supported kernel
from a doctored one produced on Joe Doe's Garage Kernel.
