it doesn't, balance_dirty() has to work only  at the highlevel.
sync_page_buffers also is no problem, we'll try again later in those
GFP_NOIO allocations.
furthmore you don't even address the writepage from loop thread on the
loop queue.
The final fix should be in rc2aa1 that I will release in a jiffy. It
takes care now of both the VM and balance_dirty().
this is the incremental fix against rc1aa1:

try_to_free_pages needs an explicit wrapping because it can be called
not only from the VM.
