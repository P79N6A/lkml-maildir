did a calltrace in lvm_do_vg_create and it contains 48 symbols between
Trace; c013c786 <sys_ioctl+16a/184>
and 
Trace; c01a78f8 <lvm_chr_ioctl+2b8/670>
which looks like they comes from an old system call as it just contiains
lots of unrelated symbols. That would suggest that lvm_char_ioctl allcates a
big object on the stack that it havn't touched?
Removing these symbols makes the calltrace look like:
>>EIP; c01a8cf2 <lvm_do_vg_create+22/498>   <=====
Trace; c01a78f8 <lvm_chr_ioctl+2b8/670>
Trace; c013c786 <sys_ioctl+16a/184>
Trace; c010856a <system_call+32/38>
not many symbols that could allcate stackspace, lets have a look how they
allocates:
0x938 <lvm_blk_ioctl>:		   sub    $0x8,%esp
not much... lets have a look at lvm_do_vg_create then:
with my patch:
0x1830 <lvm_do_vg_create>:	   sub    $0x20,%esp
without my patch:
0x1830 <lvm_do_vg_create>:	   sub    $0x11c4,%esp
whoa! 0x11c4
thats a LOT! much more than sizeof(lv_t)

of course, how could i forget.. will put together a new patch with that
fixed in a minute.
