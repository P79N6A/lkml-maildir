Upgrading to this causes my copy of hal (0.5.3-0ubuntu14) to fail to start.
Bisecting tracked it down to the following commit. Reverting just this patch
against 2.6.18-rc6 gets things working again.
9bde7497e0b54178c317fac47a18be7f948dd471 is first bad commit

    [PATCH] USB: make endpoints real struct devices
    This will allow for us to give endpoints a major/minor to create a
    "usbfs2-like" way to access endpoints directly from userspace in an
    easier manner than the current usbfs provides us.
