The message means that you have one of those mobile P6 processors
where Intel actually removed the local APIC.
(`grep flags /proc/cpuinfo` should not contain "apic" in your case.)
So the local APIC really isn't being enabled or used, and any
instability is caused by something else.
Please try 2.5.63 or .64 instead. Your 2.5.58/.59/.60 hybrid is
getting old, and your mixing of stuff may itself cause problems.
