Yeah, that really is a pretty confused-looking pnp table thing. But I have 
absolutely zero idea how PnP is even supposed to work - the whole thing is 
just a total hack for Windows, afaik.
The sad part is that *normally* the right thing to do about almost any 
BIOS information is what we do right now: just avoid that magic address 
range like the plague, because we have no clue what the heck the BIOS is 
up to. But it looks like in this particular case, some of the problems 
may arise exactly *because* we avoid that range.
It would be good to know what Windows does. If ACPI is found, does it 
perhaps just ignore all the PnP entries these days?
