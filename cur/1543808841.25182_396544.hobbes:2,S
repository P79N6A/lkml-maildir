Andi,
thanks! I must have been overlooking the implementation of those. Actually when 
you want to have nanoseconds even if the get_offset() just returns microsecond 
granularity?: If you mathematically correct the clock with nanosecond accuracy (or 
even less). With one model you'll see gradual time change, in the other case 
you'll see jumps of 1000ns. OK, the clock might jump by 100ns for other reasons, 
but currently the clock is so amazingly stable that I hardly believe the results 
I've measured (but that's quite another topic).
I'm fully aware that nanosecond resolution will give us peace for the next years. 
However my 700 MHz Pentium III is already as low as 1µs of jitter, so in theory 
the nanosecond may be worth it (e.g. getting a better estimate of the actual 
jitter).
Regards,
Ulrich
