I'm not sure if the manufacturer knows. Datarecovery companies
know. 
Sources of dataloss are: 
	- Software
	- crooked platters (especially on laptop drives)
	- heads bouncing on platter
	- broken electronics. 
They more or less happen in about the same number of cases. 
The fact that we see less "high end" disks doesn't mean they break
down less. It might mean that they get sold less (true), or that the 
people that buy them make better backups (probably also true).
