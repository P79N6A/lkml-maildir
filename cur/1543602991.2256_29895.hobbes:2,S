Please elaborate: What does "This" in "This was not the case before."
refer to? The "Could not enable APIC!" boot message or the XT-PIC in
/proc/interrupts?
2.4.10 merged code from 2.4-ac which (in some .configs) will attempt
to enable the CPU's local APIC. The boot message above is printed if
your CPU doesn't have one.

Can you send me your .configs and boot logs for both 2.4.7 and 2.4.10?
I don't think there is an actual problem, but I'd like to make sure.
