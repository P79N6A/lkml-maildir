I use the ati-driver and that suffers from the same problem. Which X
version do you use??? I want to give it a try.

I have still problems with the errors in the DSDT. Do you found any
working solution for this (I tried to modify it by the guides I found by
googling. But it didn't work for me)?
I not sure, but I think there's also a bug in the e1000 driver that
makes suspend/resume break ... do you tried to unload/load it with
acpid.
Sorry for my bad English ;-)
