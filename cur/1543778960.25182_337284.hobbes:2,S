Someone has to test it.
Andrew already wastes some of his precious time for testing before 
releasing a -mm kernel, but this doesn't catch every compile error.
If a -mm kernel doesn't compile for you, you can:
- apply a patch if it is already available
- fix it yourself
- wait for the next -mm
One of the purposes of -mm kernels is actually to find compile errors.
