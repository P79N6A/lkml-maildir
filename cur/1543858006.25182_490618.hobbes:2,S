Yes, that's what we based this implementation on.  :)

Since the map size and an entry for each page is given, it's possible to 
figure out the page size, assuming each map uses only a single page 
size.  But adding the page size would be reasonable.

Yes, that's right.  We considered using repeat counts for sequences 
pages with the same reference count (quite common), but it hasn't been 
necessary in our application (see below).

Our use for this is to optimize memory usage on very small embedded 
systems, so the number of pages hasn't been a problem.
For the same reason, not needing a special program on the target system 
to read the data is an advantage, because each extra program needed adds 
to the footprint problem.
The data is taken off the target and interpreted on another system, 
which often is of a different architecture, so the portable text format 
is useful also.
This isn't mean to say your arguments aren't important, I'm just 
explaining why this implementation is useful for us.
