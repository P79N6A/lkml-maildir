OK so (correct me if I'm wrong) there are two parts to loading modules -
getting them in memory, and then resolving references. My understanding of
Christian's work is that the bootloader (e.g. GRUB) gets them in memory, but
then it is up to the kernel linker to resolve refs. So yes, there would be
an additional piece of code (marked __init), but it would not have to be
duplicated for each bootloader -- all they have to do is get the modules in
memory and indicate via the multiboot struct where they are.
I don't think this will obsolete any existing boot methods, but it seems
like an additional genuinely useful capability for the Linux kernel to have.
