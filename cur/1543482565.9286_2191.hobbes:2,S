Anyone know if theres an update available for tcpdump and / or libpcap?
When doing a tcpdump under kernel 2.2.0 it wont resolv the hostnames and I
get the error message in var/log/messages and dmesg as:
tcpdump uses obsolete (PF_INET,SOCK_PACKET)
Actually, I remmeber this being in 2.1.xxx as well.. (first 2.1 kernel I
tried was 2.1.108 and I think it did it with that too.)
According to the info in tcpdump, and what I found when doing a search on
freshmeat is that I have the latest version of each:
[18:00:40] jim@jim:~$ tcpdump -h
tcpdump version 3.4
libpcap version 0.4
Sorry if this question has been asked a million times before..
Any fixes available?
It wont kill me if it doesnt work tho :)
