The hung task detector runs a periodic loop through the task_list, and
currently it doesn't run
over an arbitrary threshold of tasks to not hold the task_list lock
for too long.
So we thought about a way to detect if there are some writers waiting
for the lock, anf if so, release
the lock, schedule and retry.
I'm not sure this is something easy to measure, since this is more
about small latency gains (if there are).
