Ok - good.
In the final analysis, I'll take whatever works ;).
I'll lobby for keeping the code "simple" (a subjective metric) and poke
what holes I can in things, and propose what alternatives I can muster.
But so long as setting a cpusets 'cpus' in 2.6.24 leads, whether by my
historical "rewrite the pid to its own 'tasks' file" hack, or by a
proper solution such as you have advocated, or by some other scheme
or hack, to updating the cpus_allowed of each task in that cpuset, then
I'm ok.
Right now, that goal is not met, with the cgroup patches lined up in
*-mm for what will become 2.6.24.
We're getting short of time to fix this.
