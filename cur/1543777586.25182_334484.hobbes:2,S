You can fill them from a user-space buffer with "write()", and you can
read them into a user-space buffer with "read()".
It's really a pipe.
The idea of the pipe buffers is that you can _also_ send them to other 
file descriptors, or fill them from other file descriptors, without having 
to copy the data to/from user space.
