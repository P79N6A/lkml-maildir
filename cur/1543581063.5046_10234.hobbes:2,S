This is an old problem, and not related to the dvd-ram itself. If you
dirty lots of data and the target device is slow, kswapd/bdflush
will go crazy trying to free up memory. It should behave better on
2.4.1, where we impose a global limit on locked buffers. Try and run
a vmstat 1 while doing the copy, and send that along.

Reading is much easier to control.

Burning CDs is very different and does not put pressure on the mm.
