Really ???

That's what my JazDrive appears as. From Linux, I can do the same with
/dev/sda and it works just as well, but DOS doesnae recognise it
unless it's partitioned...

Why bother with DOS ???

mke2fs /dev/fd0D720
I regularly do the latter, and have never had any problems with it...

Again, why bother with DOS ???

If I do, then RedHat have been supplying a patched version since at
least RedHat 4.1 when I started with Linux - I've been doing the above
since then...
