Hello,
I'm using pppoe to connect to the internet using an Alcatel Speedtouch
USB ADSL modem. Recently I started getting this oops when connecting, I
think after upgrading br2684ctl.
After this happens I can reboot using Magic SysRq bu nothing else.
I wrote this down on a paper, if this info is not enough I can reproduce
it and write down the full oops.
EIP in pfifo_fast_dequeue
Backtrace

Thanks
