"PC-TEL announces new LinModem"
http://www.linuxworld.com/linuxworld/lw-1999-08/lw-08-linmodem.html
Does anybody have links to code or the original announcement?  The
article here says only that the drivers went to OEMs today.  No useful
links, code, or discussion of software license could be found in a quick
scan.
Thanks,
	Jeff
