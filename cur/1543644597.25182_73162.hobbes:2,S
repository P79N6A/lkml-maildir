I recently purchased a usb webcam and found that polling /proc/apm
causes the webcam in xawtv to skip.  I can do this either by doing 'cat
/proc/apm' or using the gnome battstat-applet.  Syslog says:
Sep 23 10:14:17 sirius kernel: usb-uhci.c: iso_find_start: gap in
seamless isochronous scheduling
Sep 23 10:14:18 sirius kernel: quickcam: too little data by 48260
Sep 23 10:14:18 sirius kernel: quickcam: failed qc_imag_convert()=-90
Disabling the battstat-applet and not touching /proc/apm lets xawtv work
fine without the above errors.  Polling /proc/apm also causes clock
drift.
I have a Dell Inspiron 8200 laptop (1.6Ghz Pentium 4).  Using kernel
2.4.18-686 from debian.  I read that this happened to people in the 2.2
series.  Is this a kernel apm bug or BIOS problem?  Do I just have to
live with it?
Thanks,
Jamie Strandboge
