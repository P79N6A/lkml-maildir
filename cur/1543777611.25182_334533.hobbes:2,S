Such is life. The situation arises quite often where fixing a bug
for one person breaks it for another. The lack of hardware to test on
isn't the fault of the person making the change, nor the person requesting
the change. The problem is that the person it breaks for doesn't test
testing kernels, so the problem is only found out about when its too late.
The agpgart driver for example supports around 50-60 different chipsets.
I don't have a tenth of the hardware that it supports at my disposal,
yet when I get patches fixing some problem for someone, or adding support
for yet another variant, I'm not going to go out and find the variants
I don't have.  By your metric I shouldn't apply that change.
That's not how things work.

It's impractical given the plethora of hardware combinations out there.

People tend not to test things marked 'test kernels' or 'rc kernels'.
They prefer to shout loudly when the final release happens, and
blame it on 'the new kernel development model sucking'.

You're missing my point. The bits are out there for people to
test with.  We can't help people who won't help themselves,
and they shouldn't be at all surprised to find things breaking
if they choose to not take part in testing.
