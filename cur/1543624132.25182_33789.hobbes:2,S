That is only a list of voters over the document there.
This doesn't imply that you co-authored it.
And finally this isn't a voting over the standard itself
but rather about the submission of a draft to the

Thank you very much right now I can do a diff between 2.5.3 and 2.5.4

(Which is the reason I didn't remove the parse code thus far...).
