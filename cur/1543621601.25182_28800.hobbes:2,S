Hi, 
I may not be correct but isn't the traditional ARP timeout value 20 minutes in many Unix versions such as BSD, freeBSD 
and early version of Linux. But from a certain point, Linux(only?) changed from 20 minutes to one minute. This changes the system configuration to shorten the ARP expiration timer to one minute instead of the default 20 minutes. 
Why was it changed to 1 minute ? 
thanks in advance, 
John.
