But the one true clustering infrastructure hasn't been developed yet.  The 
upcoming crop of designs need a chance to evolve before a framework is cast 
in stone.  Perhaps we will eventually end up with a generic harness, 
something like a vfs for cluster infrastructure, but in my opinion, we're far 
from being able to define that sensibly now.  It's better to implement 
exactly what a given DFS needs for the time being.

It's done both ways, actually.  No new kernel hooks are used in either case.
