Hi,
Here is output (compressed this time) from my
latency-profiler (updated for test4,
you find it on my home page)
streaming write, copy, read (Bennos)
mmap002 (separate file, as it is a Don't do that)
I also applied Andrew Mortons low latency patch
and made the same tests.
- And it does improve things, but not enough for
  this machine/relic.
This is on a PPro180 with 96MB RAM...
