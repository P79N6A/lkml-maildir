(certainly - that's why i added the 'almost' qualifier to 'total

yeah. But wouldnt it be nicer to have the same damn thing that also 
improves a vital infrastructure of Linux, namely ptrace? Andrea didnt 
even try to improve ptrace - in fact he actively (and mostly unfairly) 
attacked ptrace, implicitly weakening the security perception of other 
syscall filtering based projects like User Mode Linux. Now what we have 
is the same old ptrace, some context-switch overhead, ~900 bytes of 
bloat and a NIH API. It's a lose-lose scenario IMO ...

firstly, you might trust Andrea, but do you trust the entity that 
actually owns the patent (cpushare.com and its investors)? And even if 
you trusted Andrea, would you trust his heir(s)?

please do.
