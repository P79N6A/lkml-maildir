Right ... -EILSEQ one of those awkward faults that can appear both during
disconnect processing and during normal operation.  So it's never clear
when a driver should treat it as fatal or try to recover.

Right ... these being two separate problems:  (a) too much resubmitting,
and (b) too much printk.  The resubmitting is barely noticeable in terms
of load (and HID doesn't track such faults), but the printks are trouble.
For (b), printk_ratelimit() would be an appropriate fix for HID and
other drivers that log this fault and then attempt to recover by
resubmitting.  The attached patch should help.

That's not  true; -EILSEQ doesn't always indicate disconnect.

Since mct_u232 treats -EILSEQ as always-fatal, when it's not, that's not
the best example.  I think a better example is usbnet, which handles this
fault -- for bulk RX and TX of network packets, it doesn't currently use
interrupt URBs! -- by briefly throttling back traffic.  (It also has more
complete handling of other urb->status values than most other drivers.)
During disconnect processing, there's neither log flooding nor hundreds of
false network errors; during normal processing, there's still a chance for
hardware to recover itself.

Ratelimit some HID messages that can happen during disconnect processing.
