hm, the only change in the changelog with "PCI_PM_CAP" is:
<daniel.ritz@gmx.ch>
	[PATCH] PCI: support PCI_PM_CAP version 1
	A check for the PM_CAP version was recently added but i breaks
        devices with version 1.  if they're in power-save mode they never
        get out of it.
	Change it to also support v1.
i guess i just have to try...
thanks,
Christian.
