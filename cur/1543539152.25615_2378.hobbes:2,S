I'll try to find the bit if it is there. I still don't have enough info
(except for some T13 drafts) on how the 80-wire cable detection works in
hardware. I don't like having to manually configure this either.
It could be the BIOSes just try UDMA66 and if they get CRC errors they
fall back to a lower speed. It could be the BIOS can ask the drive if it
sees an 80-wire cable.
Btw, UDMA mode 3 (44.4 MB/sec) works well even on 40-wire cables and has
not much speed difference to udma66.
