      Fair enough; the delay has gotten excessive of late.
      Would it be satisfactory going forward for the sourceforge site to
contain patches to "standard" releases (e.g., 2.4.20), and do updates to
the current development kernel and the sourceforge site simultaneously? In
other words, sourceforge has a patch containing all bonding updates since
2.4.20 (or whichever version) was released, and each time that patch is
updated, the incremental update goes out for inclusion in the development
kernel.
