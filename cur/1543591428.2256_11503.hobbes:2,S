I get the following when ftping from one workstation to another.
Using kernel 2.4.3 and Redhat7.1:
Assertion failed! tp->tx_info[entry].skb == NULL,8139too.c,rtl8139_start_xmit,line=1676
Assertion failed! tp->tx_info[entry].mapping == 0,8139too.c,rtl8139_start_xmit,line=1677

eth0: Out-of-sync dirty pointer, 456 vs. 462.

Is there a fix for this?  Kernel 2.4.4 is worse. It gives me a 'kernel
panic'..  doing the same ftp transfer between workstations.
