Hi Linus,
I've updated the ext2/3 patches for 2.5.45.  All of these changes can
also be grabbed by pulling from:
	bk://extfs.bkbits.net/extfs-2.5-update
Linus, please pull; these patches have been tested as part of Andrew
Morton's mm tree, and have minimal risks if the relevant config turned
off.  (People have also been using the ACL and Extended Attributes
patches enabled for quite some time as well.  :-)
A complete set of all of these patches can also be found at:
