CLOSE_WAIT means that the socket has received FIN from the other end and 
has send ACK but the application holding the local socket has not yet 
closed the socket (with close() or shutdown()). Are you sure there is no 
application running that holds the CLOSE_WAIT sockets (also the remote 
end should have sockets in FIN_WAIT2 state)? Try something like 
this as root: 
netstat -an | grep CLOSE_WAIT
fuser -n tcp <localport>,<remote-addr>,<remote-port>
where <localport>, <remote-addr>, <remote-port> you take them from the 
netstat output. fuser should give you the PID of the owner of the sockets 
in CLOSE_WAIT. kill it and they should dissapear.

Strange. Try fuser again (fuser -n tcp <local-listening-port>) to see if 
it pops anything out.
