Jiri - 
OK - I will confirm that I have been running with CONFIG_GROUP_SCHED
set.  I have turned it off via menuconfig (which also gets rid of a
couple of other options like CONFIG_USER_SCHED and
CONFIG_FAIR_GROUP_SCHED) and I am performing a kernel build from clean
sources.
Get back to you in a while
Chris
