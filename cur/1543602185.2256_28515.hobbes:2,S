Ok, thanks. I don't have the firmwares not I know how to update it on
those disks. I can try hacking the mode pages however.
The "weird" thing is that this same disk works perfectly well on MacOS
with the same HW config, and used to work fine in linux until very
recently.
Justin suggested an interrupt problem. I'll look into it in more detail,
but I don't think there's anything like that. This box (PowerMac G4) has
a quite clean interrupt mapping provided by the firmware with no interrupt
sharing, and things related to parsing that firmware didn't evolve lately
(there have been no significant change to PPC OpenPIC interrupt management
since a long time).
Regards,
Ben.
