Its safe. By default kernels will be build with SLAB. SLUB becomes only a

know that its really superior overall and have thoroughly tested it in
a variety of workloads.

There will be numerous small things that will have to be addressed. There
is also some minor work to be done for tracking callers better.

I have been back and forth on doing that. There are somewhat similar 
in what they mean for SLUB. But creating synonyms may be confusing to 
those checking how page flags are being used.
