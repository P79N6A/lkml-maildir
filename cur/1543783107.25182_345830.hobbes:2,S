What it can do? In particular, can it:
* send packets with arbitrary contents? In particular, packets
  shorter than 3-address 802.11 header? packets with WEP bit set?
  Does it allow to do WEP encoding by host instead of hal?
  Any weird limitations?
* receive packets?
* tune to the given channel (or freq)?
If it can do that, everything else IIRC can be done in software.
Really, what prevents us from, say, beacons every 1/10s?

(will maintain correct sorting order in 2006,2007...)
