x86-64 has resume support. It uses 'on_each_cpu' in resume method, which
is known broken. We'd better fix it.

If you agree my other points, I'll do this.

Like x86-64 does, right? In this way, we must register a device for each
cpu. But APs directly call mcheck_init in resume time (cpuhotplug
framework). Only BP requires to call the resume method, so I think
restore_processor_state calls it might be cleaner.
