If dnotify is able to return name and event type for each dnotify event,
it is quite simple to make use of it in Samba. I tested this some time
ago, but it was too much of a hack to consider sending this to the list.
What are the chances of such an extension being accepted in the
kernel at all ?
From the LKML archives I haven't seen much love for dnotify and I
think only few Samba users would consider using a custom kernel.
