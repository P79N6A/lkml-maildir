You should find 'Disabling VIA memory write queue: [xx] aa->bb'
in your output. Values 'aa' and 'bb' are important - in other examples
it modifies value from 0x3x to 0x1x. Unfortunately I could not find
any hints whether we should clear bits 6,5 only on VIA_8363_0 if
revision is < 0x80, or whether we should not touch them at all.
In all reports from last september I remember that clearing bit 7 alone
fixed problems, but then patch which clears all three bits appeared
from VIA without real world examples which were affected by it...
