Very nice.

I hope the wait_event* functions also use memory barriers properly, but
they probably must, otherwise they won't be useful, because there we're
accessing the flags variable without a lock.

This one looks fine.

This bit looks wrong in the patch:
-       input_event(&atkbd->dev, EV_MSC, MSC_RAW, code);
+       if (atkbd->softraw)
+               input_event(&atkbd->dev, EV_MSC, MSC_RAW, code);
... we definitely want the RAW codes to be sent when we're not in
softraw mode, because that's when they're passed through keyboard.c to
the console.
So the condition needs to be inverted. However, it's not necessary at
all, since the input layer will not pass the RAW events when the MSC_RAW
bit is not set.

Great.

I think they're fine except for the above minor bug.
