Hello Len, thenks for your answer, i need a clarification on wheter it
could be a software or a hardware problem, fortunatelly i have an exact
system, so what i am going to do is to swap the four drives on the first
system to the second system, and with more time i will make the required
tests.
p.d. the machine is debian 4.0 amd64 system.

I change the drive and the problem remains, i will check changing the
hard drive cables, to see if that is the problem, the problem has
apperead three times in nearly five months, so what will be your bet ?
