/usr/include/linux/limits.h:#define PIPE_BUF        4096        /* #
bytes in atomic write to a pipe */
According to SUSv3, this is the maximum size that write is guaranteed to
be atomic for.
The minimum size this can be set to is 512.  I *think* this applies to
file io - but I'm not up to tracking all the definitions down.
So, you've already got the definitions in place, especially the size
limits.  It even reads like changing the behavior for larger writes
would be acceptable.
Just leave the small writes alone and I think you'll avoid causing large
problems for the majority of applications.
