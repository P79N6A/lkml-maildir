For some reason this patch still gives me the creeps.  Maybe it's because
we lose a page flag for something so obscure.
Nothing ever clears PG_uncached.  We'll end up with every page in the
machine marked as being uncached.
But then, nothing ever sets PG_uncached, either.  Is there some patch which
you're hiding from me?
If a page is marked uncached then it'll remain marked as uncached even
after it's unmapped.  Or will it?  Would like to see the other patch, please.
We should add PG_uncached checks to the page allocator.  Is this OK?
