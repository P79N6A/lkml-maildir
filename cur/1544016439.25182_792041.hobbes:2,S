Linux chooses the interpretation that zero means one connection. Having a
single protocol variant do different things is not nice because  a lot
of code is designed to handle multiple address families and expect the
same non address handling behaviour.
So while it may be able to claim posix compliance, its not Linux
behaviour, and its relying on a specific interpretation of posix not
being used by the OS.
At the very least the current behaviour of the SCTP code is plain rude.
