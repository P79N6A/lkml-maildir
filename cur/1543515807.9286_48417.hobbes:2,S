Hi,
In my hierarchical fair CPU scheduler (link below) I need to publish
some extra information for each process (the number of the leaf node
it belongs to). I guess this should go in /proc/<pid> somewhere, but
where exactly? Right now I add an extra line to /proc/<pid>/status so
it looks like this:
Name:   tcsh
State:  S (sleeping)
Pid:    620
PPid:   618
PNode: 	1	<--------------
Uid:    6404    6404    6404    6404
Gid:    6400    6400    6400    6400
What is the correct place to put this in order to make integration
with procps easier? Also, should I have this info available in a
system call or is the /proc interface enough?
Thanks for any comments,
Borislav
