I think this is a good idea.
It could either be done as a part of pci_enable_device(), or, which I
believe would be better, as a separate function, say
pci_copy_rom(char *dest), that the driver would call before
pci_enable_device().
Of course, in this case the ROM wouldn't be automatically exported
through sysfs, although the driver should be able to export it itself
rather easily.
