Roman,
Another question for you  - what is the best way to describe
dependancy of a sub-option on a subsystem so you won't end up with the
subsystem as a module and user built in. Something like
config IBM_ASM
        tristate "Device driver for IBM RSA service processor"
        depends on X86 && PCI && EXPERIMENTAL
...
config IBM_ASM_INPUT
        bool "Support for remote keyboard/mouse"
        depends on IBM_ASM && (INPUT=y || INPUT=IMB_ASM)
But the above feels yucky. Could we have something like:
         depends on matching(INPUT, IBM_ASM)
Thank you.
