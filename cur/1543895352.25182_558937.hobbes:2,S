Marking inline functions as __init (or __meminit etc) is quite insane,
IMHO. Note that all callers of the said inline function will also have to
be __init anyway (else modpost will barf) so the said function will
have all callsites in .init.text anyway, and hence would be inlined
in the same section as the caller (i.e. .init.text). [Note that kernel
uses always_inline.]
The annotation may still be a readability aid (which is subjective so
one can't really comment upon), but asking gcc to put into a separate
specified section, a function whose body would not be emitted by gcc
separately at all, doesn't really make much sense syntactically _or_
semantically -- gcc might not warn, of course, perhaps it's one of those
little things it takes care of by itself silently without complaining (like
taking pointers to inline functions).
