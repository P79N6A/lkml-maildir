I'm still running an -rc5 kernel with ADMA switched off entirely and I can't 
reproduce the problem. How is everybody else reproducing this?
I've been successful installing bonnie++, then going to a large XFS partition 
and running "bonnie++ -u 1000:1000" and letting it run through, all defaults.
It doesn't cause the problem I was seeing in -rc5 with ADMA on, when I switch 
ADMA off, so I think this is sufficient to fix it.
Others have reported differently. Did you guys do:
alistair@damocles:~$ cat /proc/cmdline
root=/dev/sda1 ro sata_nv.adma=0
Or something similar? This is how Jeff suggested disabling ADMA and indeed the 
messages about its use disappear from dmesg.
