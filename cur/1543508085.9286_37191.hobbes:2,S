Not really. We need to put a ton of stuff in PCI quirks before we can
let people do that in anything but suicide mode.
PCI<->PCI bus mastering DMA running card to card is a fiction on a lot
of chipsets, and even on some others requires you configure the chipset
in bug avoidance mode (eg triton)
Raw I/O from PCI/ISA space to PCI/ISA space needs bounce buffers on plenty
of chipsets too
