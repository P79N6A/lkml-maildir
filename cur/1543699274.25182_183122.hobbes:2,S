* fat16_sdb1: this is all zeros. No filesystem at all, which explains
  why it won't mount.
* fat16_mbr: nothing wrong here
   Device Boot    Start       End   #sectors  Id  System
fat16_mbr1            63 156360644  156360582   6  FAT16
fat16_mbr2             0         -          0   0  Empty
fat16_mbr3             0         -          0   0  Empty
fat16_mbr4             0         -          0   0  Empty
* fat16_sdb:
