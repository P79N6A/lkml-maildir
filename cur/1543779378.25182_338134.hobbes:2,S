Calm down.  Any argument along the lines of the change of a default
value in the defconfig screwing people over equally applies the other
way around; by not changing the defconfig, you're screwing laptop users
(and others that want less power consumption) over.  The world is not
black and white, it's a very boring gray (or a very sadening bloody
red; but I hope we won't come to that point just because of a silly
argument on lkml...)
In the end, Linus will decide this anyway.  I can understand that you
don't want to change your application.  Help developing the dynamic
tick patch, and maybe you won't have to =)
