Got the board, done some basic testing: so far so good :)
The controller also supports MSI and (at least with my chipset - G965)
it works fine:
218:      80649          0   PCI-MSI-edge      eth1
which is nice, otherwise it ends up sharing the IRQ with SATA and USB.
I also have a small patch:
On probe failure and on removal the device should be disabled:
