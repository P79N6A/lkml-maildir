Can you try to update your vmware with 
ftp://platan.vc.cvut.cz/pub/vmware/vmware-any-any-update24.tar.gz
 ?
But I do not think that it will fix your problem. I'm not able to
find how it could happen, except if skb with NULL skb->end (and though
NULL skb_shinfo()) was passed to the callback registered by dev_add_pack()...
But it should not happen...
                                            Thanks,
                                                Petr Vandrovec
