Applied both the patches - jbd-undo.patch and the dlm.patch
from mm1 kernel to the recently released OpenSuSE kernel
(kernel-smp-2.6.16_rc3-2). Recreated the filesystem using mkfs.ocfs2.
Tried the two tests that I had reported in my previous email. Both of
them run ok now.
Now started bonnie++ on one node while the same volume on the other node
is mounted and is in quiescent stage. Its been more than 5 hours now
and both the nodes are up & running. Seeing some very high load of >8 at
times on the node running bonnie++. Test node has 4GB RAM and bonnie++
is creating files of 8GB to test IO performance. Will start bonnie++
on both the nodes concurrently later.
