Ok, this is unlikely to be SATA-related, unless SATA just happened to 
corrupt something really strange.

That's "p->pids[PIDTYPE_PID].pidptr", and it looks like "p" is NULL.
That in turn _shouldn't_ happen, since that comes from 
	struct task_struct *task = proc_task(inode);
and proc_task() should always be non-NULL for any /proc file that has one 
of the pid-based dentry ops.

No, that's just a pstools bug. It shouldn't try to guess HZ at all.

Same problem. One of your existing /proc/<xxx>/ directories has a NULL 
"task" pointer, and that really shouldn't happen.
Hmm. I do worry that maybe it's the SATA thing that has written NULL 
somewhere, since the /proc code never clears that field once it is set 
(and it would always be set by the code that creates the inode in the 
first place).
