It's not only annoying, it causes gcc to generate bad code too. At least 
certain versions of gcc will generate the address *twice*, even if there 
is obviously only one address used.
If you have problems with "+m", you are often actually better off using 
just "m" and then adding a memory clobber. But that has other code 
generation downsides.
