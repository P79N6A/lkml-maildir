You don't have to sign NDAs to get the API and change your existing apps so
that they fit.
You don't have to PAY for the API.
You don't actually HAVE to update because suddenly every single Linux
support company says "oh, we don't support glibc-2.0.6 any more, you'll have
to BUY the update."
If you can upgrade for free, and no-one hides anything, I think the above
is quite acceptable. Not too often, though.
