Isn't the point that you want scripts to work when proc is not mounted,
and to be secure when it is?
I'd vote for existing behaviour when /proc is not mounted: refuse to
even try to exec setuid scripts, and run non-setuid ones as now.  When
/proc is mounted, run all scripts using /proc/self/fd.
If you want to get clever you could use the actual location that procfs
is mounted on -- if /proc/mounts and getcwd() can print a path given a
dentry I'm sure you can :-)
BTW I don't like /dev/fd because it might not exist even though procfs
is mounted.
