there are some very funamental problems with that;
say the user allocation is only half the page, and he uses the other
half of the page for something else.
during the DMA some other thread calls fork().
Now the stuff under DMA can't COW of course, so only one half gets it.
But.. what to do with the second half of the page?
this is just one of the many fine fundamental issues you'll face ;)
