This reminds me of a patch I did some time ago, without ever getting
any feedback on it:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/3/4/165
In addition to just msleep, it converted all users of schedule_timeout()
as well as sys_*select(). I actually ran with that patch on my
main worstation for a few weeks, and while it did not crash, I
saw some strange behaviour after all.
