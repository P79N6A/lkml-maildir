Can you please retain the *PageFsMisc names I've been using in my stuff?
In my opinion putting the "Fs" bit first gives a clearer indication that this
is a bit exclusively for the use of filesystems in general.

Should perhaps be:
  +#define PG_fs_misc		 8	/* for internal filesystem use only */

The patches to make the AFS filesystem use it were removed, pending a release
of updated filesystem caching patches.
The NFS filesystem patches that use it haven't yet found there way into
Andrew's tree, but are also being held pending FS-Cache being updated.
If you wish, I will send the FS-Cache patch, the AFS patch and the NFS patch
to Andrew so that you can see. CacheFS needs more work, however, before that
can be re-released.
