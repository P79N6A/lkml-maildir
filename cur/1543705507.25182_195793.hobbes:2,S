Something like attached.  Besides me not knowing if there is a better
place for it, it have the following issues:
1) Its a bit racy - iow, I get this (but only for urandom):
  request_module: runaway loop modprobe /dev/urandom
I am not sure if its the kthread patches with the one for
kthread use in modules that contributes to this (have not
checked yet).
2) Although it does work (load the right module), it seems to do it
too late.  I have removed the sleep in udev, so it cannot be this.
I do not know if this might be another kthread contribution (if I
understand the module/kthread patches correctly).  It does seem from
the request_module code though that it 'should' wait for modprobe to
complete ...  Maybe add some sort of locking (this be efficient?)?
3) Might be nice to keep track of "/dev/foo" 'aliases' that modprobe
fails for, and not try them again.
4) It only works if the whatever opened's name start with "/dev/", but
I do not think that is an issue, as it should (?) be how most things
access nodes, and should minimise complexity.
I know its very basic, I just thought to get something out of the
door for discussion and to give direction (or what direction not to
take ...).
Thanks,
