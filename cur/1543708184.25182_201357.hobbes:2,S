  The other problem is for the people who want to check the validity
 of the RAM disk before starting Linux - for instance by checking
 the CRC32 of the decompressed RAM disk - and stop the boot process
 before it is too late - i.e. in the bootloader when you can select
 another kernel version / initrd to load.
  You cannot place the decompressed initrd at a maximum address before
 knowing its decompressed size - the address to place it is the max
 address (or the end of free RAM) minus ramdisk size if I remember
 correctly. That is working for so long loading the decompressed
 initrd after few Mb after the last kernel byte (so that the kernel
 will move it where it wants - no need to move it twice) that I do
 not remember the details. Did you changed this part?
