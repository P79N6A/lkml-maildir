Argh. Actually, the patch is wrong as we are losing the 2 other
magic bits (the RonPaul bit, dunno what it is, that's how it's
called by Apple, end the other bugfix bit, some more apple magic).
Fixed patch on its way ... (as soon as I finish pulling, don't
cancel that cset, I'll apply a patch on top of it)
Ben.
