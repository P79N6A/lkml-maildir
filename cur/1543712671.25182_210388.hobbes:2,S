Well, it will be interesting to see how it goes. Unfortunately
I don't have a single realistic benchmark. In fact the only
threaded one I have is volanomark.

Yeah I think we shouldn't worry too much about the 500 CPUs
case, because they will obviously end up using their own
domains. But it is possible this would hurt smaller CPU
counts too. Again, it means testing.
I think we should probably aim to have a usable and decent
default domain for 32, maybe 64 CPUs, and not worry about
larger numbers too much if it would hurt lower end performance.
