Is this what happens when EINTR is received as well? If so, is there any
point to EINTR? Ie. close() was interrupted, but finished anyway. Would
any application care?
If there is any pending IO when this happens, is it possible to find out
when this is finished? If not, an MTA getting this would have to
temporarily defer the mail it received and hope it doesn't get an EINTR on
close() next time, I guess.
