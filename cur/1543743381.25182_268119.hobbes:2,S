Hi Guyz,
 I need to repeat sending the same acknowledgement received, for a
packet received, after the completion of the three way handshake how
should I proceed or what function should I go through to do this. I
already went through the "tcp_send_ack" function but this function is
being called for Initial 3 way hand shake also.....please do help me
out.
thanx in advance,
regards,
Pradeep
