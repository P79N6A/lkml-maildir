otherwise everything is identical to the previous request]
Hi Linus,
please pull from
git://git.infradead.org/ubi-2.6.git linux-next
The changes I kindly ask you to pull are mostly about adding some
UBI ioctls, rather than fixes. We add ioctls for UBI functionality
which has always be accessible via kernel API, so we do not really
change much and I think the changes are harmless. I just want to
make life of our users easier by pushing the patches to 2.6.29,
rather than delaying them until 2.6.30. And there are few fixes
and clean-ups.
The following changes since commit 1de9e8e70f5acc441550ca75433563d91b269bbe:
  Linus Torvalds (1):
        Linux 2.6.29-rc2

      UBI: improve ioctl commentaries
      UBI: remove unnecessry header inclusion
      UBI: allow all ioctls
      UBI: add ioctl compatibility
      UBI: use nicer 64-bit math
      UBI: remove unused variable
      UBI: fix resource de-allocation
Corentin Chary (3):
      UBI: add ioctl for map operation
      UBI: add ioctl for unmap operation
