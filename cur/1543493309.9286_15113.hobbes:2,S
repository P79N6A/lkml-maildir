Oops, last message I sent didn't go to mailing list, so...
I applied Richards patch to the 2.2.6 tree.  There was only one failure,
in vesafb.c.  I made the following changes to make it look like
Richard's patch:
--- vesafb.c.orig       Sun Apr 18 02:26:11 1999
+++ vesafb.c    Sun Apr 18 23:29:32 1999

-#ifdef CONFIG_MTRR

                mtrr_add((unsigned long)video_base, video_size,

, 1);
-#endif
+//#endif
        strcpy(fb_info.modename, "VESA VGA");
        fb_info.changevar = NULL;
I recompiled and rebooted, and voila! /proc/mtrr magically appeared!  I
performed the appropriate 'echo's and went merrily on my way.
How do I test that /proc/mtrr is actually being used?  Also, what is
Linux waiting for to add this code to the kernel?  Does he need some
more stability testing?  If so, what tests can I run to prove the code's
stability?
