Subject: irqnr fallout in gpiolib on sparc32

I hit the following build error on sparc:
drivers/gpio/gpiolib.c: In function `gpiolib_dbg_show':
drivers/gpio/gpiolib.c:1146: error: implicit declaration of function `irq_to_desc'
drivers/gpio/gpiolib.c:1146: warning: initialization makes pointer from integer without a cast
This is with an allmodconfig where I did:
make ARCH=sparc vmlinux
sparc do _not_ have GENERIC_HARDIRQS set to 'y'.
I did a simple:
#include <linux/irqnr.h> but that did not help.
I have not investigated further atm.
It is preproduceable with HEAD equal fe0bdec68b77020281dc814805edfe594ae89e0f
