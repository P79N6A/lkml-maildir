You're being a bit vague here, but I take this as follows: If trying
to acquire a write lock locks out more readers and an interrupts
tries to acquire a read lock the machine can hang.
This is a non-argument. I thing you should go back and read
Documentation/spinlocks.txt (or whatever). If interrupts can
acquire a rwlock in read mode a write lock _must_always_
lock out irqs, whether you use my patch or not. Go read the
file. It's in there.
If a read_lock sees that the high bit is set it will spin. The fact
that my patch leaves the high bit on is just a 'hey, somebody
wants to get in here.' It makes no difference to readers whether
a writer has really acquired the lock (i.e. 0 readers) or whether
a writer is waiting for the readers to go away, since in both
cases the high bit is set. Readers don't see the difference.

Why then? It does not deadlock any more than with the ordinary
behaviour.
Greetings,
