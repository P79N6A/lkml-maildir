hi everyone,
at the bottom of this article 
http://news.zdnet.co.uk/story/0,,t269-s2134430,00.html
 we can read:
Version 7.0 of Intel's compiler has been used to build Linux kernels, but 
only with special modifications to the kernel, the paper said. Intel hopes 
to eliminate those modifications by modifying its compiler and by working 
with the Linux programming community to change some features of the kernel. 
For example, Intel programmers have submitted kernel patches to permit use 
of the Intel compiler.
is there any patches availible publicly that we can use to build the kernel 
with intel's compiler? where can I find one?
regards,
greg
ps: please cc me
