No. Ethernet (and esp gigabit) has significant performance benefits from
being (and staying) on one cpu. What matters are lots of cacheline bounces,
and (even worse) packet(fragment) reordering that can happen if it moves around.

your machine is very very idle. Also remember that with modern machines,
even if a machine is 0% you probably can keep adding load to it for a while,
because then you are increasing "batching" which is very very cache
efficient operation, with the current differences between L1/L2 cache speed
and main memory speed it's not unlikely you can do 2x or 3x more work than
you do the moment idle hits 0%.

this is a sign you may want to enable IRQ mitigation in your network
driver to increase batching (unless your application is very latency bound)
