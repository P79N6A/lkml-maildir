The lower end cards are Initio... I don't know about the 3194. They have
a Linux driver for the old kernels in their download section. Actually
looks like they decided to do a binary only release which won't do you
any good... hmmm... what are the PCI/Vendor Ids? The docs say that it is
an Initio card.
