True enough; it's a race between the driver calling scsi_done() and the
timer expiring.  However, that's an acceptable race, since the timer
values are usually in the order of a few seconds and the command usually
completes in milliseconds.  the done function is called in interrupt
context after command completion, so it's as close as possible to the
actual command completion

The time between a thread being marked ready to run and actually running
has been measured in seconds on a heavily loaded system.  That makes the
race window potentially as wide as the timer, which is unacceptable.
