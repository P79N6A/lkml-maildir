I have an Intel 8x0 that doesn't work with the alsa driver, but the OSS
driver works perfectly.  I can load the alsa driver, and get interrupts from
the card (built-in on the MB), but no sound comes out, and I tried changing
the volume in alsamixer with no results except for hearing static when I
unmuted the headphone output.
I'm using 2.6.1, and I've never used alsa in 2.4.
