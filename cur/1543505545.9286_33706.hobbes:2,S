No one wants this, I think... It does not cover i2c and if something
other can use ioremap/xxx_readl, it can use little-endian readl
too. Maybe we could push gcc team to optimize (some pseudoasm)
   loadle  xx,%0
   bswap   %0
into
   loadbe  xx,%0
and vice versa? Networking could benefit from this too. And it
should be trivial comparing to alias analysis :-)

Can I asume that you (we?) just defined it? Now there is only two
outstanding issue: Is it defined whether readl()/writel() does rmb/wmb/mb 
before/after memory access (remove what does not apply) or is it
architecture dependent (as it is currently)? And second issue,
what type should be parameter to readl/writel? unsigned long or void*?
Driver uses both, void* is more frequent than unsigned long.
  And if we are talking about readl/writel, isn't time to fix i386
drivers for removing (xxx | PAGE_OFFSET) from readx/writex? I'm
using following patch for about year and only warning message I'm
getting is from 'EISA' check during bootup (which can be fixed
by using bus_to_virt(0xFFFD9)...).

(of course, this patch is not intended for inclusion into 2.3.x,
but ISA devices maintainers should try this if they are not sure...)
