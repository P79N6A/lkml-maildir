Now since when did you become my dear friend?
Configuring _your_ system to avoid a bug is very different from
running around in public screaming that a _perfectly_ _valid_ option
is not valid. Had you said something along the lines of "there is a
bug in foo that can be worked around by doing bar" it would have been
very different.

in front of your reply as specified in RFC1855, the world would be a
slightly nicer place to be.
