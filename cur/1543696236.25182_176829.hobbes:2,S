<Blush> The libext2fs library routines are there, but the userspace
tools haven't been written yet.  What I've done the few times when
I've used it is to let debugfs access the image file, and use it
mostly for examination purposes.  
What I'll probably do is add debugfs commands that allow you to copy
the superblock/block group descriptors, or the inode table, or the
block/inode allocation bitmaps from the image file back to the
filesystem.  As I said, the library routines are there, but debugfs
front ends haven't been written yet.  If someone has a critical
situation requiring them, I could probably throw together patches
within a day or so.
