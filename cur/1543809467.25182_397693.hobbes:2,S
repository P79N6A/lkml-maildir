SAS is actually a lot more complex than SATA.  SAS drives are dual
ported, so you can connect them to two controllers at once.  Makes
redundant systems much simpler to build if you can connect each physical
drive to two places at once.  They support port expanders (which SATA
seems to be starting to support although more limited).  You can run
SATA drives on an SAS controller, but of course you don't get dual port.
You can not run SAS drives on an SATA controller however.  SATA is
essentially a subset of SAS.
