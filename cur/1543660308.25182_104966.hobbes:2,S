I'm using an ASUS A7N8X (nForce2 chipset) with linux-2.4.21-pre3-ac4 + 
the patch for the __free_pages_ok oops, Subject: "[patch] 2.4.21-pre3-ac 
oops".  I also added the latest nForce drivers for both it's nic and 
audio, but they load with symbol mismatches.  I am using the nVidia NIC 
with the nvnet driver.  I haven't used sound yet as something isn't 
configured correctly yet, haven't tracked it down yet as that is low 
priority.  The system just became stable with the oops patch.  I have 
the 3Com NIC recognised, but not used.  Sofar the nVidia NIC is 
transmitting and receiving fine.  I transfered data to the system over 
the network in 100MBit full duplex mode on a switched network and it 
didn't hicup at all.  The transfer saturated the network for a few hours 
so it got a good workout.  The new copy md5sumed identicle to the 
original so there weren't hidden issues in the transfer.  For the long 
term, who knows how it will hold up.  I don't have any IEEE 1394, or 
serial IDE devices so they haven't been tested.  I haven't used USB yet, 
but it is recognised.  As of right now I'm doing testing for stability 
assesment and all looks good.
