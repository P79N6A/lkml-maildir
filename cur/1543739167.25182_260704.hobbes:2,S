About 150K compiled on x86 (before linking so that has symbol information 
etc in it).

It is small, but for the purposes we need it for it wasn't possible to 
put the code into user space. We thought about keeping it in user space 
but unfortunately the code is needed when the framebuffer console driver 
initialises which is very early in the boot sequence. So unless there is 
a way to spawn a user mode process that early in the boot sequence (it 
would have to come from the initrd image I expect) then the only option 
is to compile it into the kernel.
