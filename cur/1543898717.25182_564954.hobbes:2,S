Sorry to take so long to get back to this, Jeff.
I think the problem is on my side. It looks like a dodgy initrd
was causing the problems - a statically built kernel detects
the DVD drive without any issues so there may not be a problem
here at all. I'll continue trying to track down why the initrd
was not being built properly...
Cheers,
Dave.
