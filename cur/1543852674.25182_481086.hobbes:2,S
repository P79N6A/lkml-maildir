I don't know.  Every distinct user of the binary sysctl interface
used a different entry.  So the fact that there are a small number of
programs and thus a small number of sysctls used I agree with.  I do
not agree with the conclusion that we can predict the set of binary
sysctl that are in use.  We do not get good enough feedback from
the user community.
I don't have a problem with the principle of a conversion table
if it meant that we would never add any additional binary sysctls.

There is certainly some cleanup we could do there.  For absolutely
simple values sysctl isn't too bad.  But generated values are
horrible.
Certainly some of the parts are crufty and harder to use then
they should be.  The /proc side actually seems worse than the
binary side.
That said I have some plans on attacking sysctl in a very practical
sense, because it is required to implement multiple namespaces.
