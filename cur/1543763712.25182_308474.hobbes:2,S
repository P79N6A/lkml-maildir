Isn't it better to use a general integer type, reflecting the cpu's 
native register-size and let the compiler sort it out? Restrict all 
uses of explicit width types to where it's *really* needed, that is, in 
drivers, network-code, etc. I firmly oppose any definition of "#define 
fast_u32 u64". This kind of definitions will only create needless 
confusion.
I wonder how much other code is suffering from this kind of overly 
explicit typing. It's much easier to make assumptions about integer 
size unwittingly than it is to avoid them. I used to assume (for 
instance) that sizeof(int) == sizeof(long) == sizeof(void *) at one 
point in my career. Fortunately, reality soon asserted itself again.
