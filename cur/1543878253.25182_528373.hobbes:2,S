Hi,
I just wanted to give my opinion on things...
(and enable utf8 to read this properly)

I am quite ok with the way things are right now.
 - vc displays <?> for illegal sequences
 - vc displays e.g. "U" (latin capital U) in place when Û (latin capital
   U with accent circumflex) is not available in this font 
   (determined by the unicodemap) (I do use an unicode map, because I
   use a 4096-byte cp437 "DOS" font which requires one)
 - vc displays <?> for sequences it does not know how to print
 - xterm displays <?> for illegal sequences
 - xterm seems to display <?> on undefined glyphs (U+DFFF for ex.,
   using the "Unicode Best" font from the xterm menu)
 - xterm seems to display nothing on undefined glyphs (U+E000 for ex.,
   "Unicode Best" again)

Please, no dot, and no inverse color.
Imagine someone had the following bitmap for <unknown glyph/illegal sequence>:
################
################
################
####........####
##....####....##
##....####....##
########....####

Then inverting that again would be susceptible to confusion with
the regular '?' at 0x3F. 
(cp437 for example maps unknown/illegal to 0xFD which happens to be the
block graphic '■', but YMMV depending on font.)

I blame your latin2 unicode map. (See above about 'Û'.)
It should perhaps display a regular 'u' if it cannot display 'û',
but definitely not 'ü' (which is not called a double accent, btw).

+1 for this one :)
xterm## echo "韓国と日本にようこそ!" >/tmp/foobar.txt
vc## cat foobar.txt
currently gets things not so right, because multibyte characters are not
displayed with as many <?> as they are wide.
