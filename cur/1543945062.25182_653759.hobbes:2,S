Andrew,
The latest reports being added to the bug point to something other than cciss. This user is reporting the same problem on a white box with a 3ware SAS card. I've recreated the problem in my lab with a DL385 Opteron server. I've confirmed the 2.6.24.x kernels do not fail on Intel based platforms.
The question is what changed in the kernel to to break AMD platforms. I'll keep looking and post any updates.
