yes, disk IRQs might be delayed in that case. Without this mechanizm there
is a lockup.

i agree that NAPI is a better approach. And IRQ overload does not happen
on cards that have hardware-based irq mitigation support already. (and i
should note that those cards will likely perform even faster with NAPI.)

okay - i removed those parts already (kpolld) in today's patch. (It
initially was an experiment to prove that this is the only problem we are
facing under such loads.)
