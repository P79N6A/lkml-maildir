Not related to RCU implementation.

rcutorture (test module) patch independent of the implementation changes.

srcu (sleepable rcu) patches independent of the core RCU implementation
changes in the patchset. You can queue these up either before
or after srcu.

in this patchset.

Heh. I can always re-submit against -mm after I wait for a day or two
for comments :) Or I can wait. I think rcutorture patches are
fairly safe to merge and should go in soon. srcu and the patchset
I mailed today should probably get more testing in -mm before
going in.
