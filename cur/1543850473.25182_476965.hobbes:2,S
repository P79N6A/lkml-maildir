Similar, but not quite. For an example, look at drivers/s390/block/dcssblk.c

Right. I forgot that the guest OS needs to at least be able to ignore
the pseudo-fault. In z/VM, the pseudo-fault is delivered the first time
that a guest accesses a page. If it tries to access the same page again
without waiting for the second fault to be delivered, the hypervisor blocks
the virtual CPU.

Ok, I see.

Yes, that's what I meant. It's obviously nicer if the guest can't do that,
but it's a tradeoff of the potential security impact against on how hard
it is to implement hiding the addresses you don't want your guest to see.
To put it into other words, do you want the optimal performance, or the
optimal security?

Ok, so it's the HW's fault. They either copied bad or decided doing the
s390 approach was too expensive.
