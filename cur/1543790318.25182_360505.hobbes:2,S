I have the same problem on a Dell Inspiron 510m laptop and Fedora Core 4 
when upgrading from 2.6.12 to 2.6.13.* :
I get the following messages at 2.6.13.* startup:
PCI: Ignore bogus resource 6 [0:0] of 0000:00:02.0
PCI: Failed to allocate I/O resource #7:1000@10000 for 0000:01:01.0
PCI: Failed to allocate I/O resource #8:1000@10000 for 0000:01:01.0
PCI: Bus 2, cardbus bridge: 0000:01:01.0
I have tried "pci=routeirq", but it makes no difference.
When running 2.6.13.4 I cannot use my WLAN card (ndiswrapper).
With 2.6.12.6 there is no problem at all...
I posted lspci output and more in another mail with subject:
PCI: Failed to allocate I/O resource when upgrading to 2.6.13.*
I'm starting to suspect something in Fedora Core 4 ..
