I want this too ;) For one, it would be a perfect example of using
good existing tools to achieve the goal instead of inventing
something big and new. Also it does not reduce MTU unlike
packet-encapsulation tunnels.
Now it's an imperfect example due to noted TCP over TCP performance
problem ('internal meltdown').

I'm looking there for the first time ever, but it seems you
can twiddle TCP parameters in /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_*
(OTOH I don't see retransmit timeout controls there...
maybe they have another name?)
In order to make them per-iface one needs to have an ability to
override them in /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/ethX.
Seems like this is not implemented.
