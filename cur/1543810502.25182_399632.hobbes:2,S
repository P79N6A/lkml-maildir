Subject: [PATCH] procfs fixes for inotify/dnotify
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Problem description:
When a new process is created, the creation of the respective PID
subdirectory of /proc is deferred until the /proc-directory is beeing
read (by e.g. ps(1)). This causes file notification frameworks like
dnotify and inotify to not work correctly with /proc.
This patch fixes the problem.
