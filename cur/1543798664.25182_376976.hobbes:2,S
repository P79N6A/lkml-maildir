LLSC == Load-Locked/Store-Conditional.  It's a slightly different  
name for your Load-Reserve/Store-Conditional
You still miss his point.  That is _GOOD_ code.  Russell's point is  
that if somebody does this in generic code:
do {
	old = atomic_read(&foo);
	new = old * 2;
} while (atomic_cmpxchg(&foo, old, new) != old);
On PPC or ARM or another LLSC architecture it does not end up looking  
like the good code, it looks like this (which is clearly inefficient):
