I isolated the source of the remaining problems.  In very rare cases
even with the above patch we could still do the wrong thing.  If old_de
is pointing to the newly-added entry (i_ino is the same) we end up
deleting the new entry instead of the old one.  It looks as if the
rename never happened.  We need to verify that the name we are unlinking
is what we expect.
If is also possible that old_de is pointing to the now-unused space
at the end of a newly-split leaf block, so we still need to try
ext3_delete_entry() (which will skip the stale entry and return ENOENT)
instead of just relying on the inum + name check.
