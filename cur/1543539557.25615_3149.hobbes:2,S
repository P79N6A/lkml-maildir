You're not guaranteed that it'll happen instantly though. CPU-B might have
speculatively read the mask ahead of time. If you need strict causality
(and maybe you don't?), you need a lock.

If you're doing dynamic allocation of your structures, the SLAB allocator
will put them on cache boundaries. -malign only deals with compile time
alignment, and primarily affects the alignment of structure members.
