PA-RISC has spinlock debugging and doesn't have the option to compile with
frame pointers.  Both patches from Randolph Chung.  Also, -bk8 included
a second check for USERMODE which I've taken the liberty of removing.

"Next the statesmen will invent cheap lies, putting the blame upon 
the nation that is attacked, and every man will be glad of those
conscience-soothing falsities, and will diligently study them, and refuse
to examine any refutations of them; and thus he will by and by convince 
himself that the war is just, and will thank God for the better sleep 
he enjoys after this process of grotesque self-deception." -- Mark Twain
