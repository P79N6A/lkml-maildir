I didn't changed that because not doing __sti() is faster, because
schedule() waste time doing an __sti() unconditionally. By the time we'll
remove sti() from schedule() we'll add a debugging code that check the IF
in the CPU is disabled and that BUG in that case (and that won't happen
before 2.5.x when all the sleep_on will die).
However if you want to replace it with a spin_unlock_irq(&io_request_lock)  
in prevision to the possible removal of sti() from schedule() go ahead :).
It's just not necessary right now (and I only addressed the deadlock
condition with the patch).
