Where?  Most of that code runs with the big kernel lock currently, and
in many cases that is good enough.

In ext2, we do take the superblock lock during allocations, but that
is only to protect the "bitmap caches", and we have already tested
patches to avoid the superblock lock in such cases.

The superblock lock is there for you to take if you want it --- you
don't have to use it, but it's as good a lock as any if you want a
blocking operation to be atomic.
