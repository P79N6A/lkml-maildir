Jan,
Hardcoding things signifying special treatment of uid=0 is almost always a
bad idea. If you _really_ think that superuser (whatever entity that might
be) should be exempt from RLIMIT_NPROC and can prove that (SuSv2 seems to
be silent so you may be right), then you should use capable() to do proper
capability test and not that horrible explicit uid test as in your patch
above.
Regards,
Tigran
