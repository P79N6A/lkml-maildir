I did indeed write that.
Tabs are 8 characters in the kernel coding style.
And yes, I also wrote the other quote:

and I think that's in many ways even more important than the 8-character 
tab, because deep indentation is unreadable even if you *can* fit it on a 
single line.
In the kernel, we try to split functions up, and perhaps use inline 
functions etc, and really really avoid deep indentation.
