That is not the same.

The t10.org front page mentions ATAPI links, and the links section leads
to t13.org for ATAPI. And now?
Besides that, Linux is not currently implemented to make everybody and
their dog look like SPI with ID, LUN and everything, and until now you
have not presented anything but phantoms (such as ATAPI tapes) to
support your point why it should do that. No wonder people are losing
interest in the discussion if you don't even answer questions what the
current Linux interface don't give you, and you haven't seriously
responded to my suggestion to simply scan all transports in libscg, for
instance, "" (sg+pg), ATA:, ATAPI, RSCSI:.
