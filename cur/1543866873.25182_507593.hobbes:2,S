If all you need to do is say 'I don't need to do anything' and we have a
shared function that does that, all we're talking about doing is adding
to your struct pci_device (or whatever)
.resume = generic_empty_resume;
To me at least, that doesn't look awkward, and says cleanly and clearly
that you've checked things over and decided you know what's required.
