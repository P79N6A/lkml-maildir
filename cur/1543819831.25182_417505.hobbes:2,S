The patch looks reasonable except
- The variable should be __initdata
- The externs belong in headers
Actually I plan to garbage collect large parts of the x86-64 check_timer
RSN (basically I want to eliminate all the non ACPI compliant routing
support). That might simplify a bit. But I guess it would be still all 
needed for i386 anyways, so it's ok to have it.
