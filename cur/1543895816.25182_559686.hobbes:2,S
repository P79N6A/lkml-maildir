I have a server with port 25 closed. I was to be able
to run a script every time someone tries to connect to
port 25, but from the outside the port remains closed.
I need the script that I'm going to run get the IP
address that tried to connect.
I know it's off topic but it's part of an experiment
to stop spam. 
Thanks in advance.
