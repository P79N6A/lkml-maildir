 Hi,
  ...for an unkown reason, my keyboard seems not to be accepted by the
  newest Linux kernel (2.5.64) where under 2.4.20 it does.
  Furthermore, a couple of modules (also sound/fat/vfat...) do produce
  unresolved symbols while compiling.
  I had to include them into the kernel.
  Does anyone has a hint for the keyboard problem?
  What did I wrong ?
  Kind regards,
  Meino
