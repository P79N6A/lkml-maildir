This is a self-correcting system.  If the symbols are so offensive, someone
will get offended and will submit a patch to delete them at the appropriate
time.  If they're not so offensive then we've nothing to care about.

not me ;) It's two lines of code and makes things much simpler for the
users of our work.  Seems a no-brainer.
And practically speaking, we don't make such fundamental driver-visible
