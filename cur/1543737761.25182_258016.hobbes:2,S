Yes, that's the new method trojans are using to hide tasks... No need to 
install complicated kernel modules anymore :-)
More seriously: That's a problem with current procps utils... They just 
don't show them. I can't complain too much because I'm not doing any 
code, but it would be nice to have a working top...
As a workaround, to at least see the threads without inspecting /proc 
directly, you can use the 'm' and 'H' flags to ps, i.e.
$ ps auwxH
