I believe that was me.

That test probably won't find the hard drive error, if there is one.
Take the drive offline, run a badblocks write test (the -w option -- danger
it will destroy the data on the disk, but you have a copy on the other RAID
mirror so only run it one one drive directly, not your /dev/md device file)
I doubt that it would be a remapping problem because the drive usually only
reports errors after all of the extra blocks are used up.  
Badblocks does a linear write four times.  If you hear the drive seeking
during those writes there is a good chance that it has remapped some blocks
and the drive will fail sooner than later.

Yes, avoid this configuration.

Use 2.4.

If I were you, I'd just test a 2.4 kernel on the configuration you want.
Unless there is some binary driver that use that doesn't support 2.4 there
isn't much use staying with 2.2.
This configuration is unsafe for 2.2, and I've used raid1 and raid5 with
ext3 without any trouble, even on degraded arrays (for as short a period as
possible of course).
