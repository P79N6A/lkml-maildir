% egrep 'SL[AU]B' /usr/src/linux-2.6.21-mm2/.config
# CONFIG_SLUB_DEBUG is not set
CONFIG_SLAB=y
# CONFIG_SLUB is not set
# CONFIG_DEBUG_SLAB is not set
Just seemed odd to do a 'make oldconfig' and get prompted for the value, and it
gave a value of 'Y' to a debug  option of a feature that wasn't selected.  :)
It took me a while to convince myself that somebody hadn't changed the default
to CONFIG_SLUB while I wasn't looking....
(Maybe the order of entries needs fixing - SLAB, SLAB_DEBUG, SLUB, SLUB_DEBUG,
so that oldconfig and friends don't pop the question for debugging till *after*
they ask if the feature should be included?
