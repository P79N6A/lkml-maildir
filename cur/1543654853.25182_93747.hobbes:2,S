Lots of feedback/questions/response:
When you're on a network, more is always needed :)
Please give _plenty_ of details about what is on the other side of the 
cable: hub? switch? vendor of hub/switch?  crossover to another NIC? 
what is the port configuration and what are the capabilities of the 
other end?  is it set to autonegotiate (on the other end)?
Why do you force full duplex?  It is often the wrong thing to do.
For eepro100, you should use module option 'options' to specify 
10baseT-FD... full_duplex appears to be somewhat redundant in the 
context of your problem.
For e100, you should use 'e100_speed_duplex' module option to specify media.
Finally, I would be very interested to know the results of using ethtool 
to set, and get, your media settings.  It's in every distro these days, 
plus you can d/l it from
