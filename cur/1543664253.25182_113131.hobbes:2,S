No.
1) mtab being a symlink is interpreted differently by mount. You
   need to symlink the directory containing mtab, not mtab itself.
2) Some people might want /etc to be mounted from a different
   filesystem.
My first change was to use /etc/mtab.d/mtab, and that works fine
as long as /etc is on the root filesystem.

If /etc is in fact on the root, then /etc/mtab.d/mtab will work
as well as /mtab.d/mtab. But /etc/mtab does have a disadvantage
because I cannot symlink it to a different location. All I want
is the possibility to place a symlink pointing to the most
desired location for the particular system. So the symlink itself
must be guaranteed to be on the root. Is there any directory
beyond / which we can be sure is on the root filesystem?
Introducing problems just because you don't want to look at the
entry in the root seems like a bad idea to me. I think we need a
location that is guaranteed to be on the root filesystem, which
could be the root itself, if it needs to.
But perhaps we should then say that we require /etc to be on the
root filesystem. Since people are going to need a lot of hacks
anyway if they want their /etc elsewhere. In that case I just
propose we move mtab into a subdirectory, because then that
subdirectory can be replaced by a symlink if anybody desires to.
And the symlink itself can be considered a configuration option
specifying the location of mtab, and as such does belong in /etc.

[kasperd:pts/0:~] grep /etc/mtab /sbin/fsck*
Binary file /sbin/fsck.ext2 matches
Binary file /sbin/fsck.ext3 matches
Binary file /sbin/fsck.minix matches

Of course the -n flag can be used to some extent, but that
doesn't solve all our problems. Current rc.sysinit
implementations does use -n to mount a few filesystems, and
later uses -f to initialize the mtab. But all that happens
before running fsck, so if /var is mounted that early, we
are going to fsck it mounted.
