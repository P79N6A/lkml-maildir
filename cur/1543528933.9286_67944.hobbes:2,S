Right.  I did include that in the diff.  When a card was supported
under more than one bus, I included it under both, with the comment
changed slightly to say the bus type if appropriate.
The only issue I see is that one might be confused to see the same card 
in two different places when building a kernel.  But the alternative
to this is to allow the selection of a particular card in one place
by putting in a check to see if that card is only selected, which would
cause confusion if you had the same card on two different busses
(a close-to-zero chance, but you never know).  Maybe a comment would
suffice in that instance.
Another thing that could be done is having different CONFIG_ options
for the same card on different busses but that would seem to be
exaggerating things a bit since there are really no differences.
