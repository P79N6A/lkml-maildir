OK -- assuming you actually do flush before the DMA and invalidate 
afterwards, that works. That's what I was missing; thanks :)
That's for a prefetch operation which doesn't mark the cache line 
dirty/owned. If you have random addresses used with 'write prefetch' 
operations, that's still going to be a problem.
