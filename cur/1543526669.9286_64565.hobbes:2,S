That's the long-term plan.  Originally, the driver was released with
full console acceleration, DRI DMA support, video4linux support, and was
100% stable and bug-free.
In order to catch up with Microsoft Windows, I have slowly been removing
these features and making the driver less stable and less accelerated.
