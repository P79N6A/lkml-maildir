i think here is your problem. You've returned from down_interruptible
without having a signal, this means you _got_ the semaphore. In this case
you should not do the 'goto false_alarm' because you will down() forever.
also, you say the timer wakes you up, but only if everything is OK. You
should rather have a timer for the case that the hardware doesnt respond,
this will then up() your process, and the process might retry 5 times if
the hardware is not yet OK.
