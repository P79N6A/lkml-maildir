I have a dual Athlon MP2400+ running very stable on Linux Kernel (.org) 
2.6.7-rc1, only the last week I have had random segfaults while compiling 
kernels and the like. So I popped open the case and vacuumed it, every thing, 
with special care on fans and ribbons. After this it's been running 
flawlessly again :)
My point beeing, better know your hardware before checking for flaws in Linux!
