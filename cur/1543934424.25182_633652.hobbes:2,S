Dredging up an old regression again now:
The "make my own module to replace /sys/.../max_cstate" doesn't work
for the single-core machine we use a lot around here.
VMware is totally sluggish unless I go to another text window and do this:
    while ( true ); do echo -n ; done
At which point VMware performs well again,
the same as with "echo 1 > max_cstate" in 2.6.23.
Anyone got any suggestions on how to fix this regression
or work around it for 2.6.24 ?
Thanks
