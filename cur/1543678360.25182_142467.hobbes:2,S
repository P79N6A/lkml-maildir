Actually, rebooting and retrying, it works:

However, removing the card causes a kernel panic, and everything completely
freezes.  This also happened with 2.5.69, so it's not caused by a recent
change.
If I'm not _supposed_ to be able to remove the card, or if I'm doing it
the wrong way, please let me know... 
I'm unable to see the top of the panic, and I'm too lazy to type
it all down, but here's what I did see:
try_to_wake_up
default_wake_function
ide_release
update_process_times
ide_release
run_timer
do_timer
do_softirq
do_IRQ
common_interrupt
sys_ipc
apm_bios_call_simple
apm_do_idle
apm_cpu_idle
apm_cpu_idle
default_idle
cpu_idle
_stext
start_kernel
unknown_bootoption
Code: 0f 0b 4b 02 3f fd 31 c0 e9 a6 f7 ff ff 8d 74 26 00 55 31 d2
<0>Kernel panic: Fatal exception in interrupt
(beware of typos).
If providing all the info helps you, I'll do it.  I have no idea what I can
do to read the whole message though.
