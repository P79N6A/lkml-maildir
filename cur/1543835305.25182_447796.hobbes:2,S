I have not tried that combination.

The machine in question is at the office so I won't be able
to test that particular setup this weekend. I will test removing
the listed patches as time permits starting on Monday.
It happens every time so there is no problem in reproducing it.
I will also test 2.6.18-rc2-mm1 on my home machine which
is AMDx2 as well (but a different chipset/MB).
