Ok, since 2.6.20, there been a patch added to qla2xxx which drops the
spin_unlock_irq() call while attempting to ramp-up the queue-depth:
	commit befede3dabd204e9c546cbfbe391b29286c57da2
	Author: Seokmann Ju <seokmann.ju@qlogic.com>

	    [SCSI] qla2xxx: correct locking while call starget_for_each_device()
	    Removed spin_unlock_irq()/spin_lock_irq() pairs surrounding
	    starget_for_each_device() calls.
	    As Matthew W. pointed out, starget_for_each_device() can be called under
	    a spinlock being held.
	    The change has been tested and verified on qla2xxx.ko module.
	    Thanks Matthew W. and Hisashi H. for help.

Could you try the latest 2.6.21-rc which contains the correction?
