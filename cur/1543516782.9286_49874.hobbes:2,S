Many of the Fn+<key> combinations are no longer handled by the APM BIOS in
the new model N505 Sony notebooks. Some Windows program is used instead.  
They have also switched to a winmodem and the Yamaha YMF-744B audio
controller (Yamaha requires an NDA for programming specs). It's too bad,
they are such nice computers, but these models don't work so well with
Linux.
Even booting the Red Hat PCMCIA install disk from a USB floppy -- which
also doesn't work from Linux -- required hacking the initrd's PCMCIA
options file, since my Xircom CEM56 PCMCIA ethernet/modem card was
assigned IRQ 5 which conflicts with the PCI audio controller. And the
Xircom driver is broken, since the card doesn't work after suspend/resume
or eject/insert cycles.
But I wonder why my suspend-to-disk doesn't work, since it did use a BIOS
function under Windows...
