In Mdk 7.2+ there is something called 'alternatives' that seems to be
inherited-copied from Debian. I read aboce that RH and Conectiva have it.
It allows
you to have some gcc-2.95, gcc-2.96, and select a default gcc that
points to the one desired. It has defaults and priorities.
Same thing could be done with 'kgcc': kernel needs something called
kgcc, its up to you to set it up.
In my case (mdk), kgcc is a binary from egcs-1.1.2. If I want to try
building a kernel with gcc-2.96, I should uninstall egcs to let
kernel miss kgcc and find gcc, or tweak kernel Makefiles.
(OT: I still dont understand why egcs is still named egcs instead
of gcc-2.91)
