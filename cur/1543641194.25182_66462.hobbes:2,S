I think you're directing my attention to how to get to the inode of the
special device file. That's OK. I can get to that with no hassle. Once
there I can do whatever the sysopen with O_DIRECT does.

I'm sure :-). But until it gets packaged for debian I don't touch :-/.

Evidently not.  You must be saying that there are two possible
implementations, and that it is up to me to choose one that I like.
That's nice, but I would like to have the possibilities to choose from
in front of me! While we know schoedinger's cat may only exist or not
exist, it is only possible to say which of the two I prefer once I
have seen at least one of them :-).
