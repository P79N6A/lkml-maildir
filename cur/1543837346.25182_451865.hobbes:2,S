so what does it mean that one of Xeons here shows me the full 4GiB as
total physical memory via `free`?
btw, the box I'm getting will have the 975X chip and include 4GiB RAM
and if I understood the problem correctly even with 3GiB there will be
some memory lost to mapping-issues besides the HI/LO mem
kernel-reserving issue.
this is what I get on ia32 P4 with 3GiB
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:       3116108    2608196     507912          0     246652    2039708
and this is what I get on ia32 Xeon with 4GiB
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:       4087660     268828    3818832          0      57168     103568
