Greetings,
We'd like to have two sets of keyboard/mouse/screen connected to the
same computer with each set having the control and output of an
independent X
session each, concurrently. There might for instance be the ps/2
keyboard and mouse and
USB dittos. After attempting (and failing) we believe the problem is
really one of the kernel only allowing one virtual terminal to be active
at one time. Is this so and what can be done?
Cheers,
