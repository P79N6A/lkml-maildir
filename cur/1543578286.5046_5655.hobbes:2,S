Testing Linux version 2.4.0
	(Linux chaos 2.4.0 #4 SMP Tue Jan 9 10:20:29 EST 2001 i686)
.. shows some compatibility problems with previous software and
De-facto standards.
(1)	The netmask of the loop-back device can no longer be set 
	using:
	socket(PF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM, IPPROTO_IP)
	ioctl(SIOCSIFNETMASK)
(2)	The broadcast address of the loop-back device can no longer
	be set using:
	socket(PF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM, IPPROTO_IP)
	ioctl(SIOCSIFBRDADDR)
The errors returned are EADDRNOTAVAIL (cannot assign requested address)
This breaks embedded software that has to do everything itself, i.e.,
does not use 'ifconfig', but instead executes the ioctl()s.
A new `ifconfig`, that came with Red Hat 7, will not set these
addresses eitherB. However, an old `ifconfig` that uses two different
kinds of sockets, SOCK_PACKET and SOCK_RAW, is sucessful.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
