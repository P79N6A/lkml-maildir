I've been and looked at every single user of work_struct in the kernel (at
least, I think I have), and 99% of those just expect data to be the container
of the work_struct or a data structure linked to it.  I had to come up with a
way to deal with cases where data is something from which you can't derive
from the work_struct address, but I'm not sure how best to do that for timers.
I haven't, however, been and looked at timers, so I can't say what actually
applies there.
