First off, sorry if this message looks messed up, work forces us to use 
Lotus Notes (Bah!)
and second off heres the system that causing me greif:
Duron 1GHz on an ACS Mobo with SiS Chipset. 100MHz FSB & 384 MB PC133 
SDRAM.
and a Fujitsu 30MB ATA100 Drive
I Just finished installing Debian - Woody, which installs Kernel Version 
2.2.17 I Believe (I may be wrong there)
I installed and ran hdparm and after telling me that dma and all that 
other good stuff was disabled it said "HDIO: Failed to check BUSSTATE"
i ran hdparm -c3 -d1 -X34 to try and get DMA Working... the command ran 
fine but as soon as I tried to run another command (just 'ls' in fact) the 
system Locked up Solid.  upon rebooting my Bios didn't even Pick up the 
Hard drive.. I did a Hard reset again and the Bios picked it up, then 
reset again and it failed to pick it up again.. is it possible that I 
Screwed up my motherboard or Hard drive somehow?
the on a side note, before attempting to use hdparm under the above 
mentioned kernel, I compiled a custom 2.4.18 kernel, however it caused 
even more problems with ide, a bunch of:
hda: dma_intr: error=0x84 { DriveStatusError BadCRC }
hda: dma_intr: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
Flew by then it said ide0: reset: success, then locked up again.
if anyone can help it would be greatly appreciated.
