My ext3 multiple block allocation patch posted a while ago
includes the multiple blocks map as well. Looks mostly the same way you 
did here, but I like the way that how the # of mapped(or allocated) 
blocks are returned.
My plan is to break the whole ext3 multiple block allocation(also does 
map) patch into small patches, and re-send soon.

Here we need to be careful about the branch we just read, since we are 
looking up multiple blocks (they are on the same branch) at the same 
time, it is possible that during the look up, another threads is 
trucating the same branch we are trying to map.  Before since we are 
doing only one look up, a simple verify_chain() should be safe.
The simple way is, for the non-allocation case,  take the truncate_sem 
before the ext3_get_branch, like for the allocation-case, even for the 
simple case -- but that probably will slow down the non-allocation, 
probably a bad option.  But we could re-check(calling 
verify_chain())inside the while loop.
