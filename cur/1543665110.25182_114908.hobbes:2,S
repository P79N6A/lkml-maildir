Subject: TransMeta longrun control utility maintainer?

I know this isn't the best place to ask, but maybe someone here knows.
Who is maintaining the longrun(1) (should probably be longrun(8))
utility?  The author is listed as Daniel Quinlan
<quinlan@transmeta.com>, but mail to that address bounces.
The longrun utility frobs the MSR on TransMeta processors to switch
between performance and economy modes.
On my laptop, currently running 2.4.21-pre5-ac1, I get the following
error:
# longrun -p
longrun: error reading /dev/cpu/0/cpuid: Invalid argument
# ls -l /dev/cpu/0
total 0
cr--r--r--    1 root     root     203,   0 Aug 30  2002 cpuid
crw-------    1 root     root      10, 184 Aug 30  2002 microcode
crw-------    1 root     root     202,   0 Aug 30  2002 msr
I've seen this the last couple 2.4.2x-pre versions, but I don't know
exactly when it stopped working.  I assume somewhere along the line
the CPUID interface got reformatted.  I'm pretty sure this kernel is
configured correctly:
# CPU Frequency scaling
#
CONFIG_CPU_FREQ=y
CONFIG_X86_LONGRUN=y
CONFIG_X86_MSR=y
CONFIG_X86_CPUID=y
Help?
