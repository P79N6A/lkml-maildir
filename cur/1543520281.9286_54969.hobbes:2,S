Hi Linuxeers,
I'd like to ask one question about OptiCD driver for Linux:
* it works perfectly under Linux 5.1 (kernel 2.0.35, optcd.c ver. 1.29)
* I tried later ditribution (Linux 6.0, kernel 2.2.5-22, optcd.c here is
in version 1.11 (?), optcd.h included also).
I can insmod optcd optcd=0x340 module OK, but when mounting it, this
message appears:
ll_rw_block: device 11:00: only 1024-char blocks implemented (2048)
isofs_read_super bread failed, dev 11:00, iso_blknum=16, block 16
I have no idea where to look and what to change to solve this problem,
do you have any? How to implement longer blocks??
Thanks for help.
Best regards, Merry Christmasto you all, Pavel Lajsner
