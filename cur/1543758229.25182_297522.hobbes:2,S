dooh, these websvn patches are giving me a headache.... will have to 
learn /usr/bin/svn first :-\

yes, the prep_pci.c and its irq-mappings. the PowerStackII lines were 
changed back and forth, and a current 2.6-BK is only different in one 
line to the patch you mentioned:
http://nerdbynature.de/bits/hal/2.6.11-rc5.patched/powerpc-prep-powerstack-irq_2.6.11-rc5.patch
unfortunately it did not help either and i'll switch back to vanilla 
2.6.8 again and hopefully find out exactly when scsi stopped working.

thank you for your concern,
Christian.
