not that I am aware of. You will need more tham just psmouse ...
1. psmouse sits below serio driver. So you have to load serio. It
could be done buy hotplug but I guess at least for 8042 (standard
PC keyboard/mouse controller) it belongs to PnP BIOS subsystem
and PnP BIOS subsystem does not support hotplug currently.
2. After you have loaded corr. serio driver you need to know what
mouse driver to load. It requires some sort of autoporbing and I am
not sure it is actually done in current driver. I presume it is
possible because both Microsoft and Solaris do it. I just do not
know if it is implemented and do not have access to sources now. And
it requires support from hotplug again :)

feel free to submit a patch. Do not forget that misc is not the only
char driver that is using minors.

you miss the point. You just suggest different way to *statically*
configure your mouse driver module while your original question was
why it is not loaded automatically. It does not matter if you enter
"psmouse" in some init script or create a link for it - you still
have to do it manually.
Please look at devfs if you still want to do it. It does exactly
what you ask for.
