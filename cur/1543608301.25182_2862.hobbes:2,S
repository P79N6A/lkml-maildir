AFAIK kinda yes. It relies on IO going through block buffer cache:
Buffer cache contains the compressed data, while the page cache has it all decompressed.
This avoids excessive (de)compression (you need to compress data only when commiting page
to disk).
With 2.4 Ext2 moved (almost?) entirely out of buffer cache, you'll need to
create your own IO buffers. This is the only solution I came up with. Is there some
other approach how to cope with this problem ?
