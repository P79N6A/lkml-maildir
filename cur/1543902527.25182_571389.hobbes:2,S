Hi guys,
I have a strange problem with cron, it is doing a segfault every minute.
This problem happened out of the blue, according to authlog no users
have logged onto the system in between the time it last worked and the
time it began to fail.
The error messages from messages file is :
Jul 18 16:16:01 host100 kernel: crond[29540]: segfault at
0000000000000000 rip 0000000000000000 rsp 0000007fbffbf018 error 14
Looking at arch/x86_64/mm/fault.c, this happens when a user proc is
trying to access memory thats not in its memory map. But the address
reported in messages doesn't match /proc/pid/maps.
Does anyone have any idea what this might be?
Andrew
