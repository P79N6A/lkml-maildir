I thought i already sent you (maybe it was to someone else in private
email) the steps/cases that succeed/fail. I'll dig up the email if
not.
What version of glibc are you compiled against? I've got 2.1.3. it could
also be controller specific. I tried it on a HPT366. Haven't tried it on
my onboard (440bx motherboard).
I've only seen one confirmation on the list that duplicates what I'm
seeing.
More info later.
