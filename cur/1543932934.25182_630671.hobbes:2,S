Nah, it's just that vma->anon_vma is probably supposed to be NULL here. And if
you look at all the oopses, they do suggest one particular byte lane
is dodgy (the
corruption is in bits 41-43 and 45).
The whole thing reminds me of another bug where memtest86 didn't find anything
because it's doing cached memory accesses:
