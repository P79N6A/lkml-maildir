Well you whispered many years too late. iBCS support vanished in 2.4
because nobody cared, nobody wanted to maintain it and not a single
vendor saw a business demand to justify assigning someone to do any work
with it.
If you want it back then you need to port the 2.4 iBCS emulation layer
code to 2.6 first. Of course you could probably  also do it all in user
space with some LD_PRELOAD work and binfmt_misc. That might be a bit
slower but a lot more portable.
