Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

the attached patch, against BK-curr fixes a threading/ptrace bug noticed
by the gdb people: when a thread is ptraced but other threads in the
thread group are not then a SIGTRAP (via int3 or any of the other debug
traps) causes the child thread(s) to die unexpectedly. This is because the
default behavior for a no-handler SIGTRAP is to broadcast it.
The solution is to make all such signals specific, then the ptracer (gdb)  
can filter the signal and upon continuation it's being handled properly
(or put on the shared signal queue). SIGKILL and SIGSTOP are an exception.
The patch only affects threaded and ptrace-d processes.
