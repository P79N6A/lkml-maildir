Required, since one cannot know the data phase of vendor-specific commands.

Well,
* the target is not _issuing_ commands,
* any user issuing incorrect commands/cdbs is not your bug,
* and kernel code issuing incorrect cmands/cdbs isn't your bug either
Particularly, checking whether the kernel is doing something wrong, or 
wrong, just wastes cycles.  That's not a scalable way to code...  if 
every driver and Linux subsystem did that, things would be unbearable slow.
