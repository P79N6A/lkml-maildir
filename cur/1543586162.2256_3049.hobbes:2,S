I don't mean to walk on folks but I did make a patch that brings the ac27
version from aic7xxx-6.1.5 to aic7xxx-6.1.8.  I've compiled it and inserted it
and removed it without any of the hanging problems I encountered before.  But
the tests stopped there, no guarantees from me, I wish I could ;-)  Please
ignore this if you get something better.  I included Mr. Gibbs changelog (for
the changes from 6.1.5 to 6.1.8 his log is QUITE detailed.)
Thanks to everyone!
