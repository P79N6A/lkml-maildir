hi dmitrty, i am now testing psmouse-resync-2.6.11.patch.gz on ms-600, 
with no problems so far... should i start testing 
psmouse-resync-2.6.11-v4.patch.gz or?
btw, cursed ms600 seems to be working properly for now, unfortunately i 
don't know if its because of the patch (no dmesg messages yet) or 
because  i opened it up and cleaned it :) oh yeah, it also fell to the 
floor couple of times, perhaps that's it :)
