Saw this patch mentioned in passing and I wanted to point out
that this is a more general problem than just for asus motherboards.
I have a soyo kt880 based dragon 2 motherboard and it exhibits the
same behaviour and the same fix works (modulo looking for a different
subsystem vendor - soyo apparently don't have their own id - it's
set to VIA for all devices). And I've read about it affecting other
motherboards - I think it must be something that's present in the
reference BIOS that all the manufacturers use.
I'm not sure what the most efficient way to generalise it - especially
with cases like the Soyo one where there's no proper subvendor id.
