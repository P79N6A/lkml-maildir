I've just booted an IO-APIC capable kernel without the test patch (but with 
Nathalie's 2 patches), without "usb_handoff", with USB 2.0 DISABLED and USB 
mouse support ENABLED in BIOS.
It seems it works good, and ehci support is not loaded.

Plugging or unplugging USB devices doesn't cause no IRQ insults anymore ;-)

Well, many thanks again for you precious help Alan !

Well, it's solved by currently giving me the choice between no USB 2.0 and 
IO-APIC, or USB 2.0 and no IO-APIC. That makes a temporary solution, but I'd 
love to have both (and recall the happy times of 2.4x that was happy with 
both ;-)
Natalie, could you please tell me which kernel (I have started to have a 
number of them ;-) you'd like me <<  to boot with "apic=debug" and also 
perhaps with "pci=routeirq" and collect the trace >>, and with which BIOS 
setup ? (i.e. USB 2.0 enabled or disabled ?).
When you speak about "collecting the trace", I assume you mean the dmesg 
or /var/log/messages I'll get after booting this way ?
Thanks again to both of you Alan and Natalie. Everytime I run into serious 
trouble I remember why I love Free Software and the Free Software 
Community ;-)
Cheers.
