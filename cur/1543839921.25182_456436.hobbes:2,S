Sorry, I'm catching up with a huge post-vacation backlog, so I didn't have 
the time to look at the source code. But, if kevent performance is same or 
better, and the external epoll interface is fully supported, than I think 
the shim layer idea is a good one. Provided the shim being smaller than 
eventpoll.c :)
