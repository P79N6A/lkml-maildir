Just upgraded from rc3-mm4.
Panic on boot with this message (copied by hand ):
	kinit:do_mount
	kinit: name_to_dev_t(/dev/hda8) = dev (0,0)
	kinit:rot_dev = dev (0,0)
	kinit root_dev = dev (0,0)
	kinit trying to mount /dev/root on /root
	...........
/dev/hda8 is my root partition but I suppose dev (0,0) is the first
partition on hda which is FAT.
I tried vanilla rc4 with the same result.
