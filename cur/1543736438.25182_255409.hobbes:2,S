Some problems appear to persist (and have also haunted earlier -mm
versions of 2.6.9-rc2, haven't checked older -mm recently)
When running an Amanda (network backup) server with a 2.6.9-rc2-mm3
kernel, the backup size estimates pass properly but no backup data is
recevied from remote Amanda clients, only local backups are made.
I understand too little of the exact Amanda protocol to tell more,
vanilla 2.6.7 was fine though.
