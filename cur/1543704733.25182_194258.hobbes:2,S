If something really is accessing the drive, noatime might still help as 
long as the accesses are from the cache. BTW, it wasn't clear to me from 
his posts that he knows that something is _really_ accessing the drive, 
I thought he only had kjournald activity -- and that might be explained 
by atime updates. But I might have missed something of course!

I added him to the CC list again. That should fix it. :)
