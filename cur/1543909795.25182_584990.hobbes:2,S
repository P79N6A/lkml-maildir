I think this is definitely the way we should go and a great start.
Thanks a lot for working on this.

I think it is too late for 2.6.23, since the problem is not a
regression from 2.6.22.

I certainly agree that your patch is something we need to do, but
I vote for leaving it as-is for 2.6.23, because I can't think of a
specific problem it would fix.

Increasing IRQs is safe, but of less value than the I/O ports.  AFAIK,
nobody needs more than 2 IRQs at the moment.  I want to increase it so
I can convert hpet from an ACPI driver to a PNP driver, but there's no
hurry for that.

pnp_init_resource_table() used to set resource.name = NULL.  I don't
see where that will happen now, and since you use kmalloc/krealloc,
I think we should completely initialize the allocated space.

It's a good thing to think about, but I agree that I don't think you
introduced any additional problems here.

You removed PNP_MAX_PORT, but ISAPNP still needs it.  Unlike PNPBIOS and
ACPI, the ISAPNP spec does limit the number of resources.  So you might
want to add an ISAPNP_MAX_PORT or similar when you fix up ISAPNP.

You patch applies fine against current upstream, which includes the
Lindent patches you saw (I posted a couple more today, which cause
one conflict with your patch).  But your patch adds a few more Lindent
issues :-)  Extra blank lines, spaces between function name and open
paren, lack of space between function arguments, etc.

How about:
  static void pnp_init_port(struct resource *res)
  {
	res->start = 0;
	...
  }
and adjusting the caller?  Then you don't have to check against
allocated_ports both here and in the caller.  Or maybe just fold
into the only call site.

When this fails, it would be nice if the error message included the
associated device.

I like these changes, but they're really independent of the dynamic
allocation, aren't they?  Maybe a separate patch.

Maybe just "pnp_port_resource(dev,bar)"?

Is it safe to remove the parentheses around "dev" and "bar"?  My
personal preference is for array syntax, e.g.,
  dev->res.port_resource[bar]->start
> +static inline pnp_port_alloc(struct pnp_resource_table *res_table) { return -ENODEV }
Missing return type.

These functions (pnpbios_parse_allocated_ioresource() and
pnpacpi_parse_allocated_ioresource()) are almost identical between
PNPBIOS and PNPACPI.  What would it take to factor out this
duplicated code into a pnp_add_port() sort of function?  Maybe
could be a separate patch.
