The public docs don't say.
You should probably add them to the list of reasons to call
via_rhine_error, and let them be caught by the "wicked" error rule. A
reason to use a term that doesn't try to be specific is that we don't
really know what is causing the event.
Before your patch IntrTxUnderrun would raise the tx threshold AND issue a
CmdTxDemand. After it will only do the first. Do you know that this is an
improvement?
Does merging this error handling change into the main kernel really help
you test other things for your timeout problem? Can't you just include
this bit in your other work?
