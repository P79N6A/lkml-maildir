Great ! It is good to hear. Do you know why my machine reboots every other
time (only when booting up; I haven't seen it reboot, once up and running)
when booting SMP kernels ? I tried using kernel-2.4.20 and it too exhibits
the same behaviour.
Is there some setting in BIOS that I got wrong ? I am not into any
overclocking business, as these are meant to be used by my prof and other
folks, who care a lot about a stable system than anything else.
Will using mem=nopentium solve the problem and is it the right fix ? Will
enabling/disabling ECC memory checking in the BIOS (the BIOS seems to do
this when I select "Load Optimized Defaults") affect it ?
I seem to be a loss at narrowing down the problem to a single component as
it seems to act according to it's own whims and fantasies. And the fact
that things work with a UP kernel, makes me feel that it is not a hardware
issue. Anyone else with the same hardware experience similar issues ?
Any help is appreciated.
Thanks,
kitty.
