Well we already clearly know the content providers in the US don't trust
anyone else, and certainly don't think just using copyright laws to sue
people who violate copyright is enough.  No they want to put all sorts
of things in place to try to prevent it from even being possible to
violate copyright in the first place.  They don't believe in innocent
until proven guilty at all.
