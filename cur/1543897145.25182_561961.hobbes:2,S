People usually read the documentation after the fields named like they can
guess what they contain have values that confuse them, not before.

This is why I didn't bring up encoded addresses earlier on. :-)  
These kinds of issues are why I prefer unambiguously opaque arch-specific
encodings.  validate_settings is indeed wrong for the natural ppc encoding.
The values must be set by a call that can return an error.  That means you
can't really have a static initializer macro, unless it's intended to mean
"unspecified garbage if not used exactly right".  I favor just going back
to passing three more args to register_kernel_hw_breakpoint.

Ok, this is pretty consistent with what the newest Intel manuals say.

It is not hard to make it a separate option, so there is no reason not to.

I was not suggesting that.  CONFIG_PTRACE would require HW_BREAKPOINT on
machines where arch ptrace code uses it.

This is incorrect.  The usage of notify_die in all other cases, at least of
machine exceptions on x86, is to test for == NOTIFY_STOP and when true
short-circuit the normal effect of the exception (signal, oops).  The
notifiers should return NOTIFY_STOP if they consumed the exception wholly.
If none uses NOTIFY_STOP, then the normal user signal should happen.

From what you've said, DR_STEP will remain set on a later debug exception.
So if a non-ptrace hw breakpoint consumed the exception and left no
DR_TRAPn bits set, the thread would generate a second SIGTRAP from the
prior single-step.  Currently userland expects to have to clear DR_STEP in
dr6 via ptrace itself, but does not expect it can get a duplicate SIGTRAP
if it doesn't.
