You are triggering a known bug that is present also in 2.2.x. Basically
the problem is that the protected data is considered as freeable by the
balance_dirty() stuff (or equivalent mark_buffer_dirty stuff in 2.2.x).
That's not a ramdisk problem but more a buffer cache bug.
The hash lookup to take the backend memory in the regular buffer cache is
very fine. I had the same idea in mind (after I rejected the idea of the
global vmalloc) but never had the time to implement it :).
