Well, it makes me go "less ewww" than the current scheme, so if that turns 
out to be acceptable to others, I won't mind _too_ much.
The reason I don't like time too much persoanlly is that it's not very 
reproducible. Especially if the times are in the second range. I'd rather 
have a heuristic that is deterministic.
