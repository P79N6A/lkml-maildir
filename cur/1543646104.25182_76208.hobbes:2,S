i understand your point, and i really tried to get this problem solved
prior sending the multiple-workers patch, but it's not really doable
without major kludges. Is it really a problem on SMP boxes to have a few
more kernel threads? Those boxes are supposed to have enough RAM.
the only other way would be to introduce 1) runtime overhead [this sucks]
or 2) to split the API into per-CPU and global ones. [this isnt too good
either i think.]
there is enough flexibility internally - eg. we can in the future do
better load-balancing (if the XFS people will ever notice any problems in
this area), because right now the load-balancing is the simplest and
fastest variant: purely per-CPU. [in theory we could look at other CPU's
worker queues and queue there if they are empty or much shorter than this
CPU's worker queue.]
I also kept open the possibility of introducing multiple worker threads
per CPU in the future. But having a single-threaded an per-CPU behavior in
a single API looks quite hard.
we could perhaps do the following, add a single branch to the queue_work()
fastpath:
	if (!cwq->thread)
		cwq = wq->cpu_wq;
and the single-thread queue variant would thus fall back to using a single
queue only. Plus some sort of new variant could be used:
	struct workqueue_struct *create_single_workqueue(char *name);
[or a 'flags' argument to create_workqueue();]
The runtime thing looks slightly ugly, but i think it's acceptable. Has
anyone any better idea?

yes, but every creation/destruction use of workqueues is in some sort of
init/shutdown very-slow-path, so efficiency is not a factor. But clarity
of the code is a factor, and in the dynamic allocation case it's much
cleaner to have this:
	wq = create_workqueue("worker");
	if (!wq)
		goto error;
than:
	wq = kmalloc(sizeof(*wq), GFP_KERNEL);
	if (!wq)
		goto error;
	if (create_workqueue(wq, "worker")) {
		kfree(w);
		goto error;
	}
[and we might even switch to a workqueue SLAB cache internally anytime.]
