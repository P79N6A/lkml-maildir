It's probably safter to say "In the suspend/resume case, they may well be." 
It's not inconceivable that a system could be suspended, a faulty cpu 
replaced with another, and the system resumed. Hotplugging ought to handle 
that nicely.

Indeed. I'm also not sure that there's necessarily a guarantee that cpus will 
be hotplugged in the same order. Perhaps those with more knowledge can 
clarify there.
