Linux video capture interface: v1.00

Sigh..  I'll try the update.

It shouldn't matter, as userspace programs should not be able te fuck te
kernel over in such a complete instant deadlock.  There is something
seriously rotten with video4linux or the driver if my little userspace app
can take out machines with no warnings and no error messages on conesole/in
logs.
Recompiling didn't affect it, either.

No, the sync writes seem broken in 2.4.5.  That is very bad.
