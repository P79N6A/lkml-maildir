On most (all?) architectures {get,put}_user() has side effects:
#define put_user(x,ptr)                                                 \
  __put_user_check((__typeof__(*(ptr)))(x),(ptr),sizeof(*(ptr)))
E.g. drivers/char/ip2main.c seems to be completely broken due to constructs
like:
    rc = put_user(i2Input, pIndex++ );
I only noticed these because the compiler gave some warnings due to other
reasons.

when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
