OK, I will change the name to something like lin2efi.

Ask every user to setup a crash dump environment is a bit difficult
because some configuration like reserving memory, loading crash dump
kernel must be done. But saving OOPS information in FLASH via EFI
variable runtime service is quite simple, without configuration
requirement. That is, there could be more bug report with OOPS
information. I think this is useful.
