HZ is irrelevant.  If you receive an interrupt, and typical wakeup
latency is 0.05ms, then waiting until the next timer tick in 1ms is a spike.
Some applications tolerate that, some don't.

I misunderstood you and now you misunderstood me :)
It's ok to _disable_ irqs for the reasons I gave.  I thought of that
because you pointed to the _disable_ in your quote of default_idle.
The _enable_ is there for a different reason.
Scheduling is not allowed with interrupts disabled.  So we know that
when schedule() returns, local irqs are enabled.  So poll_idle() doesn't
need to enable them.  I suggest this change:
        - remove the local_irq_enable() from poll_idle().
        - add local_irq_enable() at the start of cpu_idle(), before the loop.
