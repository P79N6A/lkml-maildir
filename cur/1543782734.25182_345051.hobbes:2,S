Hi, Andrew.
I just tested the USB mouse with 2.6.13-rc6-mm2 and ACPI disabled
(which, according to Linus, is one of the "usual suspects") and the
problem still occurred.
On the other hand, with kernel 2.6.13-rc5-mm1 (which I am running now),
I didn't have any problems plugging and unplugging the mouse. Here are
the messages I get in dmesg (2.6.13-rc5-mm1) after I plug/unplug the
mouse:
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
usb 1-1.2: new low speed USB device using uhci_hcd and address 4
input: USB HID v1.00 Mouse [USB Wheel Mouse] on usb-0000:00:04.2-1.2
usb 1-1.2: USB disconnect, address 4
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Just thought you might like to know about this. If you want me to test
any other version, please let me know.
Thanks, Rogério Brito.
