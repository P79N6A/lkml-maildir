I don't think the NTP algorithms are overkill. We have the same problem
space - multiple nodes some of which can be rogue (eg pit misreads, tsc
weirdness), inability to directly sample the clock on another node, need
for an efficient way to bend clocks. The fundamental algorithm is
extremely simple its all the networks, security, ui and glue that isnt -
stuff we can skip.
