Subject: [PATCH 0/6] vmtrunc: lowlat vmtruncate drop i_mmap_lock
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/10/3/71

Here's a set of patches against 2.6.9-rc3-mm1, or Ingo's -S7 VP tree:
allow lower latency in vmtruncate (more generally, unmap_mapping_range)
by dropping the i_mmap_lock when required.  Though I've been focussing
on correctness rather than latency myself: do these work for you, Ingo?
1/6 undoes something of Andrea's, 2/6 undoes something of Ingo's:
I thought I might as well provide patches as ask the questions, please
let us know why if you disagree with them.  3/6 is cosmetic, 4/6 is
the real work, 5/6 corrects some loose ends, 6/6 is for testing.
Worth the effort, and ~700 bytes bloat, and additional int in each vma?
If only root could run-bash-shared-mappings, I'd say not worth it; but
it seems a little like prio_tree itself, we're not sure we need it,
but feel more secure to have the solution.
