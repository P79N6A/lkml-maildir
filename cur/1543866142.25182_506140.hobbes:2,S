Agree with removing the "init" word.  A single digit is assumed by the kernel
to be the run level.
Also, given the variability of those values, leave the current documentation
at levels 1 and 3.
BTW, the "init" keyword, *with* a value, specifies an alternate init process
binary, e.g,, the default is "init=/sbin/init"
