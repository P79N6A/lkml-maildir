it's the MAX_TRACE define in kernel/latency.c.
but please try to the -31-10 kernel that i've just uploaded, it has a
number of tracer enhancements:
 - process name tracking. The new format is:
    bash- 3633 80000003 0.264ms (+0.000ms): idle_cpu (wake_idle)
    bash- 3633 80000003 0.264ms (+0.000ms): idle_cpu (wake_idle)
    bash- 3633 80000003 0.264ms (+0.000ms): find_next_bit (wake_idle)
  this makes it easier to identify which process does what. This feature 
  has no significant overhead in the tracer itself, all the hard work is
  done when /proc/latency_trace is read by the user.
 - /proc/sys/kernel/mcount_enabled flag: if disabled then 
   /proc/latency_trace will only contain 'custom' events, but no 
   per-function entries. This can be useful to trace really long 
   latencies, to get a rough idea of what is going on.
 - /proc/latency_trace atomicity. It was fundamentally non-atomic, due 
   to it being a 4K-granular file interface. Now the kernel has a second
   layer of saved-trace logic, which makes sure that the only time the
   trace is switched is when the header of the trace is read. I.e. when
   cp-ing or cat-ing /proc/latency_trace, no new trace info will be
   used. This change could solve some of the 'truncated traces'
   weirdnesses reported.
