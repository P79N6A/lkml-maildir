No.  I'm doing what Dirk Hohndel recommended I do during a phone call
that happened at his initiative, last Friday morning.  
What "system" would you be referring to, anyway, Jeff?  Is there some
reason a respected open-source developer like Dirk who has concerns
should not have a conversation with Linus to address problems he thinks
are significant?  Is there some reason I should not have asked the kbuild
team members to give him appropriate background?
I don't understand what is upsetting you.  Is there some rule that all
conversations with Linus must go through Jeff Garzik?  If so, I was never
informed of it.
