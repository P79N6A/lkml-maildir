Good.
+#define BUFCTL_END	0xfeffFFFF
+#define BUFCTL_FREE	0xf7ffFFFE
+#define	SLAB_LIMIT	0xf0ffFFFD
f7ffffff is not a valid value, slab never writes that into a bufctl. 
Someone did a ++ or "|= 1", or a hw bug.
I think the Athlon cpus have ECC for the L2 cache - could you check in 
the bios that ECC checking is enabled?
