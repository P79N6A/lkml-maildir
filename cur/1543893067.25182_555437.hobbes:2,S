Frankly i'm not in a position to judge, but if that's the best way to provide
the desired functionality, then it sounds good.  But please make sure you
bounce this all off someone who actually knows what they're talking about. ;o)
Really I was just casually following along this ongoing conversation and had
a more conceptual/design question about how things were implemented.  A few
people explained how AA labelling at "runtime" wasn't conceptually very
different than what SELinux did.  All that begged the question as to why 
that functionality couldn't just be tacked on to SELinux?
