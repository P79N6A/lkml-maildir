I think this won't be a problem - if there is no guest attached then, when
we register pass-through serio port, psmouse_probe will run. The very first
thing it to tries identify attached device and bails out if something
goes wrong. In our case it should time out. This will leave us with a serio
without input device attached - a perfectly valid scenario I think.
