No it isn't.
fh->data is an array of characters, thus without any alignment
restrictions.
'struct knfsd' begins with a pointer, thus it must be 4 or 8 byte
aligned.
The portable 'struct nfs_fh' structure would be
#define NFS_HANDLESIZE	64
struct nfs_fh
{
	unsigned short len;
	void* data[NFS_HANDLESIZE/sizeof(void*)];
};
But now its too late for such a change - it breaks at least i386,
probably all platforms.
Does knfsd actually need all 64 bytes in the nfs_fh?
What about aligning the 'struct knfsd' manually?
-	struct knfsd* ptr = fh->data;
+	struct knfsd* ptr = (fh->data+15)&(~15);
That would be kernel only, no ABI problems.
