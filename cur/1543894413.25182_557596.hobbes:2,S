There is no problem with them using 4k page size concurrently to a higher

Magical? There is nothing magical about doing transfers in the size that 
is supported by a device. That is good sense.

Of course there is. The seeks are reduced since there are an factor 
of 16 less metadata blocks. fsck does not read files. It just reads 
metadata structures. And the larger contiguous areas the faster.
