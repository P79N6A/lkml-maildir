There  have been two PCI drivers in the past three days where
users have reported that the IRQ was wrong. One patch was
provided to enable the device before requesting the IRQ, this
being inherently dangerous. So, if you are the one who
re-wrote the PCI stuff so that the IRQ is wrong when the
device is claimed, then I think you have a duty to fix the
code that you have broken.
The correct way to fix the broken code is to make sure that
the IRQ, reported in the structure, is correct. Alternate
methods might be a pci_route_irq() function.
The existing PCI code is broken. The fact that an invalid
IRQ is reported in the structure is PROOF that it is broken
and requires no further discussion. Many of us have to
use this stuff in a professional environment, we can't
enable devices without an interrupt handler in place
because it is not allowed in code that is subject to
peer review. We also can't use code when such problems
as invalid values in returned data are discovered.
Two months ago I discovered this problem and reported it, hoping
that the person who broke existing code would fix it. It has
not been fixed.
