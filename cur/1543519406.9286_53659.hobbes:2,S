Eh why not? Last time I checked it worked.
Anyway, the sonicvibes driver _needs_ to be able to allocate these
resources,
noone else is going to do this for it, as the sonicvibes chip
uses nonstandard registers for the DDMA address, and no BIOS I've seen
knows about sonicvibes peculiarity.
Any suggestion?
