Hi,
Just tried to build 2.6.21-rc5-rt6 and it is failing on build time.
...
kernel/sched.c: In function ‘__schedule’:
kernel/sched.c:3830: error: ‘print_functions’ undeclared (first use in
this function)
kernel/sched.c:3830: error: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only
once
kernel/sched.c:3830: error: for each function it appears in.)
...
arch/i386/kernel/apic.c: In function ‘smp_apic_timer_interrupt’:
arch/i386/kernel/apic.c:589: error: invalid lvalue in assignment
arch/i386/kernel/apic.c:608: error: invalid lvalue in assignment
...
Just to let you know that -rt5 was doing fine with very same .config .
Cheers.
