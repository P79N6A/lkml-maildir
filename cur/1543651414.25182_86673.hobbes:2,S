Going beyond IDE it might be cleaner to be able to do
	struct bio_command_ops
	{
		eject: idedisk_eject,
		suspend: idedisk_suspend,
		identify: idedisk_identify,
		...
		[maybe even read:/write: in some cases
		 like smart scsi raids]
	}
that way IDE disk and all the other weirdass drives can have -one-
command parser not the twenty differently buggy ones we have now simply
by doing
	if(rq_is_command(rq))
		bio_do_command(rq, &bio_command_ops);
Its also very convenient as we can add fields to the structure and then
to drives without breaking the API and without so much updating
