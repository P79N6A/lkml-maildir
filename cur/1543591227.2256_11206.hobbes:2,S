Subject says it all...
The patch is the driver portion for the Mwave applied against the 2.4.4
kernel proper..
It was a little big to send directly to the list..  So...  You'll be able
to pick it up at 
http://www.ibm.com/linux/ltc/
 shortly..  Until it goes up
there, it will be available at 
http://www.haywired.net/MWAVE/...
Please throw any comments, questions, suggestions, hard objects this way...
Cheers...Paul...
