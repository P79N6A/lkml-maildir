Well, duh. TiVo, under whose control the software running on my Tivo is, set
up the signing key themself. *Someone* has to decide what software runs, the
GPL cannot rationally decide who that is because it's an
application-specific authorization decision.

That the person who decides what software runs on that hardware can remove
them if they please. *Someone* has to decide what software runs on a
particular piece of hardware, right?

This is, again, an argument that is totally alien to the GPL. The idea that
you have 'special' rights to the software on some hardware but not others is
simply insane. It is totally out of left field with respect to the GPL. The
GPL is about being able to use the software on *ANY* hardware for which you
have the right to decide what software runs.

You can argue this, but it's not a GPL argument. It's a reasonable argument,
but it has nothing whatsoever to do with GPL rights. GPL rights are about
being able to use the software on *any* hardware you want, not special
rights to use the software on some one particular piece of hardware. GPL
rights are rights against obstacles to getting the source code and legally
modifying it and distributing it, not rights against authorization obstacles
placed by people who own hardware.

Yes, they are becoming a user. They might very well be using those
computers. It's absolutely absurd to argue that the right to choose what
software runs on a piece of hardware must go to the user of that hardware.
In any event, it's totally alien to the GPL which is not at all about who
gets to decide what software runs on what hardware.

You can state what the GPLv3 does as many times as you want, but special
rights to particular pieces of hardware is *TOTALLY* alien to the spirit of
the GPL. The GPL was always about equal rights to use the software in any
hardware.
