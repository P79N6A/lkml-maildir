	Hello Bill , Severly clipped original message .
	If that 5509 is running slightly older code (and maybe even
	newer) there is(was?) a difficulty with auto-negotiation between
	the cisco & many adapters .  This btw is(was?) a known issue with
	cisco .  Also the last item I had concerning the matter ,  cisco
	recommeded static duplex & rate settings .  Hth ,  JimL
