Ah, sorry for messing CRIS up, I was unaware of that.

Yes.

I don't think that's ugly, and the comment is good.
It only actually needs "aligned(2)", would that be better?
But what does "aligned(2)" or "aligned(4)" do on 64-bit machines -
any danger of it aligning stupidly?  I think not, but know little.

Really?  Precarious, I think you'd still need to insist on alignment.

You guessed right!
