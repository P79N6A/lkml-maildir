Subject: [PATCH 03/11] unpaged: sound nopage get_page
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Something noticed when studying use of VM_RESERVED in different drivers:
snd_usX2Y_hwdep_pcm_vm_nopage omitted to get_page: fixed.
And how did this work before?  Aargh!  That nopage is returning a page
from within a buffer allocated by snd_malloc_pages, which allocates a
high-order page, then does SetPageReserved on each 0-order page within.
That would have worked in 2.6.14, because when the area was unmapped,
PageReserved inhibited put_page.  2.6.15-rc1 removed that inhibition
(while leaving ineffective PageReserveds around for now), but it hasn't
caused trouble because.. we've not been freeing from VM_RESERVED at all.
