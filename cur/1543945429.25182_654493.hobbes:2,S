You either register callbacks if the device can react properly or you 
dont. If you dont then the device will continue to have the problem with 
page pinning etc until someone comes around and implements the 
mmu callbacks to fix these issues.
I have doubts regarding the claim that some devices just cannot be made to 
suspend and resume appropriately. They obviously can be shutdown and so 
its a matter of sequencing the things the right way. I.e. stop the app 
wait for a quiet period then release resources etc.
