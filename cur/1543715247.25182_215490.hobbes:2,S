Hello
I created a bsd-disklabel on a harddisk using GNU Parted. Earlyer (and
in Knoppix), i was able to get access to the partison on it (it is a
standart ext3), however, on newer 2.4.x and 2.6.x (only tryed one 2.6.x,
and it did not work), I am not able to read the disklabel. dmesg tells
me this:
hda: 39876480 sectors (20416 MB) w/1966KiB Cache, CHS=39560/16/63
 /dev/ide/host0/bus0/target0/lun0: p1 p2 p3 p4 < p5 p6 p7 p8 p9 >
hdb: max request size: 128KiB
hdb: 156301488 sectors (80026 MB) w/2048KiB Cache, CHS=65535/16/63,
UDMA(100)
 /dev/ide/host0/bus0/target1/lun0: unknown partition table
I have complied in the BDS-disklabelsupport in the Advanced partition
selection. (The one is listed under PC BIOS).  Is there something wrong
with my configuration? (I am on a x86 computer)
Sincerly
