It does. Sorry. I didn't read enough of the context.
To answer the question, I guess the answer is that although they're
different creatures, they have similarities. This is one of them, which
is why I could make the mistake I did. Nothing in the issue being
discussed was unique to suspend-to-ram. Perhaps we (or at least I) focus
too much on the similarities, but that doesn't mean they're not there.
