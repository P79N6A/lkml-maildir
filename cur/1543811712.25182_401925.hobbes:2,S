Yes, but you need to use fuse_get_conn() and check the result (see
fuse_dev_poll()).

Yes, file holds a reference to fuse_conn.

I don't see how that could happen.  fuse_dev_release() removes the
file from fc->fasync, and fasync_helper() and kill_fasync() are
protected with fasync_lock against racing with each other.
Although it may be possible that kill_fasync() races with the final
fput(), but as I see kill_fasync() only uses the file->f_owner field
which should still be valid before and during file->release().
Which BUG is triggered?

Yes it's possible, it is how a normal unmount happens:
  - umount() called on the filesystem, filesystem unmounted
  - read on /dev/fuse returns -ENODEV
  - userspace filesystem exits gracefuly

This should be POLL_IN too, no?

I like this style better:
	return fasync_helper(fd, file, on, &fc->fasync);
