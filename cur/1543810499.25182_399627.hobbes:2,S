I think the bug is clear - the logic in acpi_os_unmap_memory needs to match 
what acpi_os_map_memory() does for EFI. In particular this means not calling
iounmap.
He probably has a EFI system where this caused troubles.
But think even acpi_os_miap_memory is broken - I doubt the efi_mem_attributes
thing guarantees that  the memory is mapped. I guess this was added for
IA64 because ioremap used to return uncached memory there and IA64 doesn't
like this for memory accesses or something like that.
But Bjorn afaik recently fixed this by making ioremap handle it. So the right 
fix probably would be to just drop all the efi_enabled gunk in acpi_os_map_memory 
and just always use ioremap()
Also removed this ptr > ULONG_MAX check. Obvious it can never trigger.
