What I'm saying is that read and write are _no_more_ related to the
file than fstat.  Read/write operate on inode data, fstat operates on
inode metadata.
OK, read/write have a position state in the open file, but that is
something the filesystem should _never_ touch anyway, so it's
irrelevant to the discussion.
The fact is, if the filesystem uses a stateful open API, which defines
an fstat() operation, it can be useful to use that instead of the
plain stat().  But that is only possible if the VFS supplies the open
file, otherwise there will be just "hunting around" for suitable open
files, or "sillyrenaming".  None of which is desirable.
