But a certain order is needed. I need to have the soundcard initialised
before the gameport is initialised or the gameport cannot be accessed.
This is just one problem. The irda protocal needs get_random_bytes during
initialisation.
I tried to get the ide driver to accept hdx=ide-scsi, but my __setup
functions keep getting called at the very beginning of the visible boot.
What am I doing wrong ?
