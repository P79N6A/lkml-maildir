As I said in previous mail, my p4c800-e dlx works fine:
--- 
ACPI: PCI interrupt 0000:00:1d.7[D] -> GSI 23 (level, low) -> IRQ 193

You using the latest bios version?  Maybe check if there is a beta
bios available ?
I saw somebody said newer bios versions do not work (Locks after
ACPI init).  I am not sure if this is related, but for our boards
you do not want ISAPNP or PNPBIOS, just ACPI (it used to oops at
some stage - either after ACPI init or PNP init), and I did enable
CONFIG_PNP ...

# grep PNP .config
CONFIG_PNP=y
# CONFIG_PNP_DEBUG is not set
# CONFIG_ISAPNP is not set
# CONFIG_PNPBIOS is not set
# CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEPNP is not set
# CONFIG_IP_PNP is not set
