2.7G is what you can map right now in 2.6 with 3:1.
dropping 1G from the userspace means reducing the shm mappings to 1.7G
of address space.
sorry if I made some confusion.

yes it can be bigger there. I wrote it to simplify, I mean it doesn't
need to be bigger, but it can.

agreed.

yes, it should be enough to show something interesting. However the best
would be to really run it on a 32G box, 32G should be really show the
divergence. getting results w/ and w/o hugetlbfs may be interesting too
(it's not clear if 4:4 will benefit more or less from hutetlbfs, it will
walk only twice to reach the physical page, but OTOH flushing the tlb so
frequently will partly invalidate the huge tlb behaviour).

Me too. I've a testcase here that works 50% slower in 2.6 than 2.4, due
the slowdown in fork/pagefaults etc.. (real apps of course doesn't show
it, this is a "malicious" testcase ;).
#include <sys/mman.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#define SIZE (1024*1024*1024)
int main(int argc, char ** argv)
{
  int fd, level, max_level;
  char * start, * end, * tmp;
  max_level = atoi(argv[1]);
  fd = open("/tmp/x", O_CREAT|O_RDWR);
  if (fd < 0)
    perror("open"), exit(1);
  if (ftruncate(fd, SIZE) < 0)
    perror("truncate"), exit(1);
  if ((start = mmap(0, SIZE, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE, fd, 0)) == MAP_FAILED)
    perror("mmap"), exit(1);
  end = start + SIZE;
  
  for (tmp = start; tmp < end; tmp += 4096) {
    *tmp = 0;
  }
  for (level = 0; level < max_level; level++) {
    if (fork() < 0)
      perror("fork"), exit(1);
    if (munmap(start, SIZE) < 0)
      perror("munmap"), exit(1);
    if ((start = mmap(0, SIZE, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE, fd, 0)) == MAP_FAILED)
      perror("mmap"), exit(1);
    end = start + SIZE;
  
    for (tmp = start; tmp < end; tmp += 4096) {
      *(volatile char *)tmp;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
(it's insecure since "/tmp/x" is fixed, change that file if you need
local security).

cool ;)
as I wrote to Wim to make it more acceptable we'll have to modify your
3.5:0.5 PAE patch to do 2.5:1.5 too, to give userspace another 512m that
the kernel actually doesn't need. And still I'm not sure if Wim can live
with 1.7G ipcshm and 512m of shmfs window, if that's not enough user
address space then it's unlikely this thread will go anywhere since 512m
are needed to handle an additional 32G with a reasonable margin (even
after shrinking the page_t to the 2.4 levels).
The last issue that we may run into are apps assuming the stack is at 3G
fixed, some jvm assumed that, but they should be fixed by now (at the
very least it's not hard at all to fix those).
It also depends on the performance difference if this is worthwhile, if
the difference isn't very significant 4:4 will be certainly prefereable
so you can also allocate 4G in the same task for apps not using syscalls
or page faults or flood of network irqs.
