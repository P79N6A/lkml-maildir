It would be absolutely trivial.  On most architectures you would have:
#define virt_to_agp  virt_to_phys
#define agp_to_virt  phys_to_virt
On Xen you would have:
#define virt_to_agp  virt_to_bus
#define agp_to_virt  bus_to_virt
Or, more likely, defined to arbitrary_machine_to_phys
or whatever it was called ;)
