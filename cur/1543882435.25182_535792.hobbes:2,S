erk.  I suspect this will have its sticky paws all over core mm.

a) That wasn't a part of Christoph's original rationale list, so forgive
   me for thinking it is not so important and got snuck in post-facto when
   things got tough.
b) I don't immediately see why a filesystam cannot implement larger
   blocksizes via this scheme - instantiate and lock four pages and go for
   it.

We cannot say anything about neatness until we've seen mmap.
