x86_64 dirty fix to restore dual command line store
Ok, It seems that the patch below effectivly removes the second
copy of the command line.  This means that any modification to the
'working' command line (as returned from setup_arch) is incorrectly
visible in userspace via /proc/cmdline.
	x86_64-mm-early-param.patch
This patch restores the second copy.  Its probabally not the right
way to fix this long term.
