There is a difference btween plain wrong and misleading text, printing
wrong things to the console, text that confuses non first language
speakers and accidentally removing humour.
Someone broke a little bit of asm and it got fixed. Someone broke
the pnp layer a lot longer before and its still not fixed. You
have regular releases, stuff gets broken now and then.
People are actually *doing* things, give them a break.
