I don't know if that would really fix it, because ideally you want to
read the prev_mono_time at the same point you calculate the time inside
the read lock'ed critical section.
The difficulty is then even if you do read the prev value in a
serialized manner, you have to serialize the writes properly as well. So
really you want to do all four operations (read prev, calculate time, do
comparision, write prev) under a write lock.
Again, I'm not totally sure about this, but even removing the part where
it overwrites the ts pointer w/ the prev time, I do not see
inconsistencies from userland. 
Also I'm not seeing clusters of messages. If you call
clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC,..) in a loop, you'll see tons of these
message.
The only odd part is the regularness of the errors. I'm seeing the ~5000
ns deltas ~every ms. So there may be something going wrong, but I don't
see it yet.
