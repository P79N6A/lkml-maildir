The gid's of the kmw group match on both sides.  The problem happens
whether root squashing is on or off.  Unless the execute bit for 'other'
is turned on for the parent directory, the file appears to be locked
when being accessed from the nfs client (tru64) side.
My theory may be wrong, but the problem still exists.
