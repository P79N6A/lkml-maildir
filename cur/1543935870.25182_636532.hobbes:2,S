Ehm. Isn't that a bit unexpected:
#define PNP_DRIVER_RES_DO_NOT_CHANGE    0x0001  /* do not change the state 
of the device */
#define PNP_DRIVER_RES_DISABLE          0x0003  /* ensure the device is 
disabled */
I'd say that disabling is changing, so isn't this just a braino where 
someone meant to write 2 instead of 3?
