Hi All,
Is there any way to strip symbols from modules .o files ?
for example, fat.o has many symbols and when you run `file' command
on fat.o - it says that is is not a stripped file. 
I tried running `strip' command on fat.o and then tried to 
run insmod on the stripped fat.o and then tried to run
insmod on vfat.o. But the insmod on vfat.o generated the
"Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address
00000000" message. If there any way to remove symbols and still
load the module successfully and make it work ? Or the
problem is with the strip command ? Should I be using
something else instead of strip to remove symbols from
the module .o ?
I think, I am missing something. But I am not sure.
Thanks and regards,
-hiren
