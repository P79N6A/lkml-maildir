I think that your expectation is unreasonable.  XFS was designed for 
machines where popping in a working hard drive was feasible.  Making a 
disk layout adaptable to any arbitrary block going bad is more work than 
you might think, and for their intended market (not laptops) they did 
the right thing. 
You can buy cables that allow you to connect laptop drives to desktops.
