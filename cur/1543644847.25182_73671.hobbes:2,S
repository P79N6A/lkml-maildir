No, the important part is that the process adds itself and marks itself as
sleeping _before_ doing the test. The "marks itself as sleeping" part is 
the really important one.
The "removes itself" was/is really just a matter of being able to handle 
loops more efficiently (which is probably a case of optimizing for the 
wrong thing, since the common case is to wait for just _one_ event, 
especially since we made the herd behaviour go away with the exclusive 
stuff).
The "removes itself" thing was also something I thought was cleaner (have 
the same entity do both add and remove), but I certainly buy into the CPU 
lock bouncing arguments against it, so..

The test and add yes. Remove no, since remove is always done after we know 
we're waking up.
