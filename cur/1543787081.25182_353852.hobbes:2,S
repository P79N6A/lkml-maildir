Hi Luke,
I tested your previous version of this patch on an AMD64. I found one 64 bit
bug, crashing the kernel. After fixing it, it worked quite well.
Please change in the file libata-core.c the line
ap->hotplug_timer.data = (unsigned int)ap;
to
ap->hotplug_timer.data = (unsigned long)ap;
Thanks for this great patch,
Bernhard
