Sorry - I had assumed my network was so much faster than my
disk subsystem I'd never get a short read from a socket except at
the end of the transfer.   Pretty silly of me, in hindsight.
I can see now how even one short read early would screw up 
the alignment for splicing into a file for the rest of the 
transfer, right?
Here's some new results:
Run w/check for short read on socket in vmsplice case:
- /dev/zero -> /dev/null w/ socket read + file write: 1130 MB/s
   (Man, my network is running fast today.  I don't know why.)
- /dev/zero -> /dev/null w/ socket read + vmsplice/splice: 1028 MB/s
- /dev/zero -> file w/ socket read + vmsplice/splice: 336 MB/s
Rerun w/original:
- /dev/zero -> /dev/null w/ socket read + vmsplice/splice: 1026 MB/s
- /dev/zero -> file w/ socket read + vmsplice/splice: 285 MB/s
- /dev/zero -> file w/ socket read + file write: 382 MB/s
So I was losing 50 MB/s due to short reads on the socket 
screwing up the alignment for splice.  Sorry to waste your
time on that.
But, it looks like socket-read + file-write is still ~50 MB/s 
faster than socket-read + vmsplice/splice (assuming I didn't 
screw up my short read fix - see patch below). I assume that's 
still unexpected?

Hmmm.  Is it worth me trying to do some sort of kernel 
profiling to see if there is anything unexpected with 
my setup?  If so, do you have a preference as to what 
I would use?  
Here's how I fixed my app to fix up (I think) short reads.
Maybe I missed your point?
