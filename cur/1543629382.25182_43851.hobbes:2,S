No. It's not stupid. Unix defines a kind of operating system that
has certain characteristics and/or attributes. Process/kernel shared
address space is one of them. It's a name that has historical
signifigance.
Linux does not have to be Unix. In fact, divorcing virtual address
space may make a better Operating System and it's good that somebody
it planning that. But the result will not be the 25-30 year old
architecture we call Unix. It will be Linux. And it just might
be the thing that makes Linux shine above others, so don't call
this difference stupid.
