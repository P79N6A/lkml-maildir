It makes sense, but that should be done for gendisk.  I.e. we should have
(name, base, range) - not a node for each partition.
At least one obvious reason for oops is that thing sets ->disk_dev, which is
under complete control of partitions/check.c.  If anything, setting
->driverfs_dev would be legitimate - use of ->disk_dev is a bug.
Al, waiting for already merged stuff to show up in snapshots...
