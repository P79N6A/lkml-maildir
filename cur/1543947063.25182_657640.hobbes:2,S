Linus has strongly stated that we should merge hardware drivers early,
and I agree: although the nes driver clearly needs more work, there's
no advantage to users with the hardware in forcing them to wait for
2.6.26 to merge the driver, since they'll just have to patch the
grungy code in themselves anyway.  And by merging the driver early, we
get fixed up for any tree-wide changes and allow janitors to help with
the cleanup.
(By the way, the code is not that pretty but it a lot closer to
upstream style than most driver submissions)

Just for the record, although this driver is under drivers/infiniband,
it is actually for a device that does iWARP/10 Gb ethernet.  At some
point we may want to rename drivers/infiniband to drivers/rdma, but so
far the churn hasn't seemed worth it for what is basically a cosmetic
issue.
