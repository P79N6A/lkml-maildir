Hello,
I met a problem when trying to upgrade my Linux kernel to 2.4.0-test10.
The machine is Compay AP550, dual processor, mem 512 MB, and 863 MHZ freq.
It has two scsi host adaptors. one is AIC-7892 ultra 160/m connected to 
internal hard disk, and the other is AHA-3944 ultra scsi connected to 
an attached disk. The boot process stops after detection of the first
scsi host, error info is:
	scsi: aborting command due to time out: pid0, scsci1, channel 0, 
	id 0, lun 0, Inquiry 00 00 00 ff 00
Previous OS on this machine was RedHat 6.2 kernel version 2.2.14
looking forward to your help!
Xiangping
