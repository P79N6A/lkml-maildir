True, and the only sane value here is NOOP, any other policy would not
be a good value. With this in mind would you rather prefer a 'boolean'
argument suggesting we use NOOP over the default scheduler?
(The whole switch API was done so I could reset the policy from the
iSCSI side of things without changing the regular SCSI code - however
even that doesn't seem to work out, mnc suggested to do it in userspace,
so that API can go too)
Would you agree that this hint on intelligent scheduling could be used
to set the initial policy, the user can always override when he
disagrees.
These network block devices like NBD, iSCSI and AoE often talk to
virtual disks, any attempt to be smart is a waste of time.

It was a hack, and its gone now.
