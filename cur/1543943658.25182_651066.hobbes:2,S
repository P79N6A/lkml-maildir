The initstr tool mentioned doesn't touches this case, as it doesn't
searches specific functions such as printk, it looks for strings inside
__init marked functions. In the above example abc won't be marked as
__initdata.
So if there are two places where the same string is used, with one being
in a __init function one copy goes to .init.data and another to .data.
