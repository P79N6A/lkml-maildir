Ah you mean the patch I done at schedule_timeout() implementation time!!
Yes, it could have caused the bug:
        /* Go to sleep waiting for GRANT callback. Some servers seem
         * to lose callbacks, however, so we're going to poll from
         * time to time just to make sure.
         *
         * For now, the retry frequency is pretty high; normally 
         * a 1 minute timeout would do. See the comment before
         * nlmclnt_lock for an explanation.
         */
        /*
         * FIXME, can we be not interruptible and so be allowed to use
         * a timeout here? -arca
         */
/*      current->timeout = jiffies + 30 * HZ; */
        sleep_on(&block.b_wait);
Unfortunately I don't know what the code does. I don't know if we could be
allowed to use sleep_on_interruptible() and to care signals at that time.
In such case you could replace the two lines of code with:
	interruptible_sleep_on_timeout(&block.b_wait, 30 * HZ);
Doing that you are sure to avoid the deadlock, but you risk to exit from
the sleep_on() too early if a signal will be sent to the process that is
sleeping...
In the case interruptible_sleep_on() is not allowed we could
implement a sleep_on_timeout() just to avoid code duplication 
putting a timer in lockd by hand, because now schedule_timeout() 
handle the UNINTERRUPTIBLE state fine.
