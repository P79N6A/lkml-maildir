I was just looking for some feedback or an explanation to why a lot of
commonly configured system parameters are static.
For an example:  My machines have huge loads and run hundreds and at times
thousands of processes.  Having to edit NR_TASKS and other definitions and
then recompiling the kernel so that it will support larger figures seems
rather backwards.
Even small items such as inodes and fds seems to be a problem with less
experienced users attempting to run a machine that is very busy.
Most of the kernel parameters are fine for desktop machines, but how about
the growing numbers of server systems that are running into these problems?
 Why don't more things adjust dynamically during system operation according
to the system's usage?  Are we expecting too much, or is this a neglected
part of the kernel?
