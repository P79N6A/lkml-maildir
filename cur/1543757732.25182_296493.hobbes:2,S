Hi Andrew,
I don't think we can get away with it, I think most modern
architectures have this problem. I've been trying to avoid it for
several iterations but I kept getting pushed towards this.

Pardon my lack of clue, but why not?
Maybe I should explain how I use it - in the mspec driver I pull a
chunk of pages out using alloc_pages and convert them all to uncached
(I need to do a chunk due to the speculation restrictions on ia64) and
then stick them into a special allocator and set page->PG_uncached
when doing so (the allocator is not tied to the uncached so I posted
the patch to Tony Luck). Ie. once the pages have been grabbed with
alloc_pages() and converted to uncached, they are never put back into
the generic pool.
It may be there are other places which needs to learn to respect the
flag?
Cheers,
Jes
