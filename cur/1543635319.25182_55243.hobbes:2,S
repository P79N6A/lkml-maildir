Isn't it supposed to return EINVAL if "fd is bound to a file which
doesn't support synchronization..."  That's what POSIX 4 says.
Errors:
EBADF	fildes is not a valid file descriptor.
EINVAL	The file descriptor is valid, but the system doesn't support
	fsync on this particular file.
I think code that opens a directory as a file is broken. We have
opendir() for that and it returns a DIR pointer, not a file descriptor.
If the directory was properly opened, one would never attempt to
fsync() it.
Cheers,
