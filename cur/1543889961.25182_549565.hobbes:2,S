Alright, so it's configurable. This reduces it from being broken to being a 
truly bad idea.

No, forget that line of reasoning. As soon as you run anything unconfined that 
isn't trusted, you have basically lost control. Relying on the fact 
that /bin/ls won't do any harm is assuming to much. Features might exist that 
allow it to be abused, new features might get added, or there may be bugs. 
Just don't do it.
