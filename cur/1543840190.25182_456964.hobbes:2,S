I got docs from uli earlier in the year, I just never got around to
using them to the extent I intended, and then I switched to working
wirelessly most of the time. I didn't have to sign an NDA to get the
PDF, so it should be okay for me to distribute it, right? If that's the
case, then assuming LKML won't take a PDF, I'll reply again after giving
people time to tell me I'm wrong, removing LKML and giving everyone
directly emailed a copy (it's not huge).
Regards,
Nigel
