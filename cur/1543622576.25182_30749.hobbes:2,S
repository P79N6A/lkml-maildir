After a large file (4gigs) transfer using Samba attempts to access the file
(also across Samba) resulted in lots of the following type of message.
hda: dma_intr: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
hda: dma_intr: error=0x40 { UncorrectableError }, LBAsect=250746,
sector=250680
end_request: I/O error, dev 03:01 (hda), sector 250680
Can anyone point me in the direction of a reason/solution?
Thanks,
    Simon
