This remains confusing. I went and investigated and the SD disable
bit is 0x20. The one lspci dump from the IFL90 shows that 0x80 is
set by default, but setting this on my laptop did not disable the
SD controller. I will need to collect more information from owners
to find out what's really going on.
Do you want to wait on this before taking this patch?
