I got a compile error here. This should be.
	dev->dev.dma_mask = &dev->dma_mask;
I did not have a current bk handy on the lab machine, but I ran it on
a 2.5.47 view with a few offset warnings.
The machine is a 2x pci systems with the following drivers loaded:
	aic7xxx, ips, qlogicisp.
It just booted and ran a little IO.
