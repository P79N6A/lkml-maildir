True.

There really isn't an RDMA helper layer.  The fact that the IB headers
live in include/rdma is, as best as I can tell, an artefact of Roland
being accommodating to someone's suggestion when he was going through
the same process with the IB tree as we are now with our driver.

I can't solve that problem.  If other vendors don't want to pony up
their driver source and take the same kinds of slings and arrows I'm
doing, I'm not going to do the work to provide them with a generic set
of abstractions to use in their out-of-tree or proprietary drivers.

I can't square these two statements.  Can you indicate what you might
have been talking about, if not SIOCSIFFLAGS?

I know about the ethtool interfaces, but we implement only a tiny
fraction of the stuff that is relevant to ethtool at this level of
abstraction.

Both.
