That'll improve backups but will break other things.
To do this effectively we'd need to change the policy so that new pagecache
allocations cause no scanning of used-twice pages at all.  So that even
after many gigs of backing up, the working set is still there.
Problem is, (for example) what about the person who has 80% of memory in
used-twice state and who then reads a file or files which are 20% or more of
the size of memory, two or more times.  It'll be 100% cache misses, every time.
This will happen quite a lot.  IOW, once those pages are in used-twice state,
how does further pagecache activity ever get them _out_ of that state?  Only
by joining the used-twice page set, and that can't happen if the used-once-so-far
pages got reclaimed.
Doing a refault thing would help a bit, but stops working at a certain point.

The LD_PRELOAD code has the fd and can mmap it to perform the pagecache
probe.
fincore() would be a bit neater, but given the rarity with which mincore()
is used it's perhaps hard to justify adding a slightly more efficient and
slightly more convenient subset of mincore().
