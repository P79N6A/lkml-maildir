All,
  Our team is discussing the best approach to calculating the swap file size 
for the 2.4.18 kernels and newer on systems with 6 - 8 Gb of RAM.  Does the 
"Double The System Ram" rule still apply?
I'm sorry if I offend anyone by posting this here, I'm just looking for an 
authoritative / accurate response.
A quote on the topic from one of our engineers:
  "I'd disagree on the Swapfile size.  Swapfiles over 2 Gig are insane.  If
  a host is consuming 2+ Gig of real RAM, and consuming another 2 Gig of
  Swap, something is wrong with the apps that are running on that host.
  (I can go into a big tirade on how Linux VM works, if anyone wants ;) )"
Thanks for your suggestions!
