iirc the %fs one is at least. But it has been a while since I've looked
at this part of the kernel via performance traces.

your worst case scenario would be if the segment override would make it
a "complex" instruction, so not parallel decodable. That'd mean it would
basically cost you 6 or 7 instruction slots that can't be filled...
while an and and such at least run nicely in parallel with other stuff.
I don't know which if any processors actually do this, but it's rare/new
enough that I'd not be surprised if there are some.
