I've just always compiled acpi_processor in, it's only logical that if 
you are using a power management feature, that you compile in the power 
management interface, and if your stuff deals directly with the cpu, you 
may want to compile the acpi_processor driver in.  The only reason I 
knew to do that though, was because i go through each option.  Someone 
else looking to just enable cpufreq, would skip the sub-drivers of ACPI, 
and never know better. We dont suggest anywhere in the cpufreq driver, 
we dont mention restrictions or limits of the driver without acpi, and 
we certainly dont select it or make it dependent (except silently and 
invisibly to the user). 
Every other cpufreq driver demands acpi.  In windows you have to have 
acpi, the p states are called acpi p states everywhere.  The problem 
here is that the author to the powernow_k8 driver found a way to get 
some cpufreq functionality without acpi. 
So to make everyone happy, maybe we should have the silently 
selected/deselected driver exposed to the user, as a sub-driver. 
->  Powernow K8 / athlon64  cpufreq driver     y/m/n
------->    ACPI support      y/m/n
we do this silently in the Kconfig, i dont see the problem with exposing 
it so we dont have to muck around forcing people to use acpi that dont 
need to and selecting drivers they may not really need.
