Hi.
Your patch makes menuconfig crash if you try to configure Irda support.
Apparently because menuconfig does not approve of empty if statements
and your patch creates one (in net/irda/compressors/Config.in).
The following patch (against yours) comments out everything in net/irda/
compressors/Config.in since it seemed to be a hollow shell anyhow.
