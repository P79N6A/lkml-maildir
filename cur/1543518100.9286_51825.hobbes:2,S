Hi Linus,
Here is my latest version of the patch for fixing bad Toshiba notebook
keyboards - making sure the PC keyboard delay is at least 250ms, which
seems to be a good thing for others with broken keyboards.
Please include it in the kernel, if possible.  I will work further to
improve it (add logging, test it, etc) - I will keep you posted, but I 
would like to have it in the dev kernel so others can test it as well.
Thanks,
Andrei Pitis
