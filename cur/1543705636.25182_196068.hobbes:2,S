Hi Folks,
I have some problems with my sensors.
In kernel 2.6.1 i received temperatures like 69,5°C CPU and 41°C
mainboard. Since 2.6.2 I received 418,5°C CPU and 347,0°C
mainboard. This error occured in 2.6.2rc3, too.
My hardware an Asus A7V133 mainboard, I used the following modules:
,----
| i2c-dev
| i2c-viapro  
| eeprom  
| via686a
| w83781d
`----
Do you need any other informations?
Any hints? Bug?
