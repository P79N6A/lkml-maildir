I reported the same thing on Sunday to the bitkeeper-users ML (see below)
Interestingly, I can 'pull' to an existing linux-2.5 repo now, but clone is 
still busted.
bitkeeper-users is deathly quiet. I got no reply since sunday. Has christmas 
started early at Bitmovers?   ;)
+-----------------------------------------+
Since yesterday night, when I try a pull an existing clone of 
bk://linux.bkbits.net/linux-2.6, I get a hang 20s hang like this:
 andrew@orac linux-bk $ bk pull
 Pull bk://linux.bkbits.net/linux-2.6
   -> file://home/andrew/kernels/linux-bk
 Nothing to pull.
 [HANG 20s or so]
 andrew@orac linux-bk $ 
If I try to get a new clone, I get some really funky stuff:
 andrew@orac test $ bk clone bk://linux.bkbits.net/linux-2.6
 Clone bk://linux.bkbits.net/linux-2.6
    -> file://home/andrew/test/linux-2.5
 BAD gzip hdr
 read: No such file or directory
 0 bytes uncompressed to 0, nanX expansion
 sfio errored
 andrew@orac test $
Tried on two seperate machines in UK and US, so I don't think its me or 
internet breakage...
