When you say "will not necessarily" can I take that to mean that it
currently does, but it might (will) change??
In that case can we have the patch as it stands and when the path to
block devices in /sys changes, the ioctl can be changed at the same
time to match?
Or are you saying that as the kernel is today, some block devices
appear under /devices/..., in which case could you please give an
example?
Thanks,
