Hmm, I agree that it makes sense to give a short overview of each LSM. A 
description of the AppArmor model and implementation can be found in the 
directory that John referred to actually. I'm unsure how much of that makes

I guess actual end user information doesn't belong in the kernel sources; that 
really seems wrong.
Thanks,
