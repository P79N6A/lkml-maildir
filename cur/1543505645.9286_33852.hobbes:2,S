I had problems attempting to mount an ext2 fs on a CDROM. Therefore,
I hacked the kernel to pretend that the CDROM was a regular disk drive.
Somebody then told me you can always force a mount using `mount -o loop'
pretending that it's the loopback device. I didn't try it since I don't
have an ext2 CDROM file-system anymore. However, I know you can mount
a regular file this way, for instance making ramdisk images:
	dd if=/dev/zero of=${IMAGE} bs=1k count=${DISKSIZE}
	mke2fs -Fq ${IMAGE} ${DISKSIZE}
	mount -o loop ${IMAGE} ${RAMDISK}
Cheers,
