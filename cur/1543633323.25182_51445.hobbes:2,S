I use SIOCDEVPRIVATE as the starting value for new ioctls:
/*
 *   Interface to the private device functions. User API sees this only.
 */
#define CHEK_SEEPROM   SIOCDEVPRIVATE + 0x07
#define READ_SEEPROM   SIOCDEVPRIVATE + 0x08
#define WRITE_SEEPROM  SIOCDEVPRIVATE + 0x09
I've seen this in several drivers. I think this is the way to do it
so there is no interference with other ioctls.
Cheers,
