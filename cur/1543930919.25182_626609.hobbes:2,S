If the drivers are on the L4 side, they would have no obligation to
provide them. That's one of the reasons device manufacturers look at
virtualized/micro-kernel architectures.
Of course, if the device has Linux in it, they would still need to
provide the sources for that, either in the product or via a written
offer.
