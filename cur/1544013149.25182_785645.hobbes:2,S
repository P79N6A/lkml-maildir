Yep sounds good, but this happens even if there is no dirty data
needing a sync back to disk.
$ grep 'Dirty\|Write' /proc/meminfo 
Dirty:               0 kB
Writeback:           0 kB
WritebackTmp:        0 kB
$ cat /some/uncached/file >/dev/null 
Jan  1 11:43:49 gw kernel: cat(6615): READ block 864408 on hda1 
Jan  1 11:43:51 gw kernel: kjournald(760): WRITE block 2376 on hda1 
Note, the reason I ask is this is a SSD so just because a physical
read has taken place recently unneeded writes should be avoided.
Turning laptop_mode to 0, but leaving other settings the same
resolves the uneeded write:
$ echo 0 > /proc/sys/vm/laptop_mode 
$ grep 'Dirty\|Write' /proc/meminfo 
Dirty:               0 kB
Writeback:           0 kB
WritebackTmp:        0 kB
$ cat /some/other/uncached/file >/dev/null
Jan  1 11:47:15 gw kernel: cat(6653): READ block 864258 on hda1
