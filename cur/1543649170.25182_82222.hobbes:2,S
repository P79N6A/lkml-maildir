I'm not sure what was conceptually wrong. There are other multiplexing
syscalls
in the kernel - so the concept of multiplexing cannot be wrong?
Or is setsockopt broken too?
If it's just the particular signature used
right now that's the problem, then that's easily fixed.
For example, what would be wrong in making the security syscall follow the
get/set sockopt approach?

Netfilter provides nf_register_sockopt() to allow open-ended registration
of socket-opt handling by a module - without any review. So do many other
kernel interfaces.
