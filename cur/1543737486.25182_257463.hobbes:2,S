I explicitely implied that I only use CKRM. This means all processes
have the trivial cpus_allowed mask and are allowed to go wherever they
want. With this assumption (and my understanding of CKRM) the
drawbacks will be there.
Cpusets is my method of choice (for the future) for setting the
cpus_allowed mask (and the memories_allowed). If I use cpusets AND
CKRM together all is fine, of course.

Right now it isn't AFAIK. Paul, if all cpusets on the same level are
disjunct this certainly simplifies life. Would this be a too strong
limitation for you? We could live with it.

That is intended, yes. A task escaping from its set would be a
security (or denial of service) risk.
