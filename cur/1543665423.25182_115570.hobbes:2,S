The next best thing might be for the spelling police
to maintain an archive of all the accepted spellfix patches.
That would let a sufficiently motivated person
(say, a spelling policeman) to offer a patch update
service with a reasonable certainty that he could
bring arbitrary patches up to date with respect to
the spellfixes in the main tree.
I've outlined a proposal for this at 
http://www.kegel.com/kerspell
This spellfix business is way more work than is reasonable.
The people who spend the time making it work while taking
care of all these issues (avoiding pun removal, avoiding
breakage, avoiding wrong corrections, patch updating)
are clearly on acid, but I salute them.  Me, I just take
notes and watch :-)
