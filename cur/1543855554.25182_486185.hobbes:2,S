Subject: [PATCH 0/6] KVM: Add AMD SVM support
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This patchset adds support for AMD processors with SVM (or AMD-V) 
technology.
KVM on AMD is fairly fast despite the naive mmu implementation.  It 
should also support many more guests, since the real mode implementation 
on AMD is complete.
The bulk of the work was performed by Yaniv; I ported it to the arch 
split patchset I posted yesterday.
