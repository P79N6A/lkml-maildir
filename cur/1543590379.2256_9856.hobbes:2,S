For comparison purposes,
I use stock kernel 2.4.4.
Use scsi tape support as module.
Tape drive is HP c1539 (aka 1533a) dds-2.
This drive is on the scsi chain of Tekram dc390, tmscsim driver
(used as module).
Hardware compression is enabled.
Under this setup,
    tar cvbf 20 /dev/st0 large_directory
works perfectly, and I can read it back without problem.
What software do you use for writing to tape?
Or maybe the problem is in the latest -ac tree only?
(HP has a software that checks the hardware installation and
drive health.
The software runs on Windows, and it supports firmware upgrade,
simple drive self-check, read/write check, etc. Highly recommended.
Obviously, the software is meant to help the HP tech support.
It generates a support ticket with the internal state of the firmware
media recoverable error statistics history and the like.
If the manufacturer of your tape drive has
a similar test software, you might want to check
the hardware using the vendor software.)
