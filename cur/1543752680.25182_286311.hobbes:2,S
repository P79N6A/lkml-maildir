This is like saying "somebody will do the bad thing, it might as well be 
me". I don't believe that is a basis for doing things right.
First off, I've tried to make it clear that while I believe in openness, 
my beliefs are not exclusive to anybody elses beliefs. I'd rather see 
shades of gray than absolute black-and-white.
Secondly, I'd much rather have the mindset where we try to minimize the
likelihood of a catastrophic failure. That includes having many
_different_ ways of gettign things out: Bk, tar-balls, email. Diversity is
a _fundamental_ security strength. It also includes having diversity in 
other areas, ie multiple architectures.
I see vendor-sec as trying to treat the symptoms. It's a "take two
aspirins, call me in the morning". And you seem to not even want to
discuss treating the disease - and vendor-sec is PART of the disease. It's
the drug that people get addicted to when they decided to treat the
symptoms.
I think Linux - just by the source being open - has one real treatmeant to 
one fundamental -cause- of insecurity, namely "we don't care, and we'll 
put our heads in the sane". Open source just doesn't allow that mentality.
And similarly, I think truly open disclosure is another fundamental 
-treatment-, in that it doesn't _allow_ the mentality that vendor-sec 
tends to instill in people.  Well, maybe not "treatment" per se: it's more 
like admitting you have a problem.
It's like alcoholism. Admitting you have a problem is the first step. 
vendor-sec is the band-aid that allows you to try to ignore the problem 
("I can handle it - I could stop any day").
