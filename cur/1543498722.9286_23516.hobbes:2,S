I think we should wakeup the last process that gone to sleep even in the
up() case. We should simple ask for an EXCLUSIVE wakeup.
Here a patch to do that:

NOTE: There is at least one very important detail in the
semaphore-helper.h. The i386 port would be just fine about this detail.
The detail is that waking_non_zero_interruptible() _must_ first check if
it can exits succesfully from down_interruptible(). Only if it can't own
the seamphore it has to check if there is a signal pending and fail only
in such case. Otherwise we may wakeup a task in exclusive mode, and then
such task will exit because it's been interrupted and other tasks won't be
wokenup for the exclusive thing -> deadlock.
Davide if you'll do benchmarkes of your wake_up_sem, please do a bench
also over the patch above. Thanks.

PS. for the equation complain, sorry, I mistaken M for N :) (you defined N
but you never used it).
