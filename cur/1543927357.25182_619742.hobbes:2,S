I belive it *must* remain pinned in memory to be effective,
because I also know it must run much more frequently than it
currently seems to run, in order to respond to quick changes
in IRQ load.
Eg. a heretofore idle device is suddenly now being used to copy
a DVD-sized file around.  It *must* respond quickly to changes
in load like this, or system latencies will suffer badly.
Cheers
