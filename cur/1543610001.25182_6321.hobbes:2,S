Hi,
  Good day!
  I am making some changes to the ethernet header for all outgoing
packets.  I need to add a tag to it.  This tag will be recognised by the
target machine.
  Currently, I am putting this tag addition code in dev_queue_xmit(). 
It doesn't work.  When I do gdb (remote gdb), I found that
skb->mac.ethernet was 0.  What does it mean?
  Is the ethernet header removed by the calling functions of
dev_queue_xmit()?
  And, if I have to do changes to all outgoing ethernet packets, which
is the appropriate function?  Isn't dev_queue_xmit() the correct one?
  Thanks a lot in advance,
Regards,
Suresh.
