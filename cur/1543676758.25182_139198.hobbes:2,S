With 32 bit return values, ix86 Linux has a file-size limitation
which is currently about 0x7fffffff. Unfortunately, instead of
returning from a write() with a -1 and errno being set, so that
a program can do something about it, write() executes a signal(25)
which kills the task even if trapped. Is this one of those <expletive
deleted> POSIX requirements or is somebody going to fix it?
Cheers,
