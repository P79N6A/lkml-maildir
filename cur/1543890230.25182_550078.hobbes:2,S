The correct order is:
- create one version with all the optimizations you have in mind
- then ensure that it works correctly on all architectures and
  document why your version is that much faster than the original 
  version and why you know your optimizations have no side effects
- then get it tested in -mm
After these steps, you can start considering getting it into mainline.
