Here is an initial list (as from a UNICOS perspective):
gids            - list of groups (access control)
acids           - list of projects (accounting)
permbits        - UNICOS permission bits (extended priveleges)
sitebits        - UNICOS local permission bits (extended priveleges)
archlim         - disk quota limit (actually a non-file-migration limit)
cpuquota        - total cpu time available
jproclim[bi]    - maximum number of processes
jcpulim[bi]     - cpulimit
jmemlim[bi]     - memory limit (virtual limit)
jfilelim[bi]    - maximum file size limit
jtapelim[bi][0] - able to reserve tape drive of this type
jtapelim[bi][1..7] - more tape drive types
nice[bi]                - nice value
pcpulim[bi]     - per process cpu limit
pmemlim[bi]     - per process memory limit
pfilelim[bi]    - per process file limit (more limited quota)
jpelimit[bi]    - per job number of MPP elements limit
jmpptime[bi]    - per job MPP reservation time limit
pcorelim[bi]    - per process core dump limit
pfdlimit[bi]    - per process file id limit
jshmsegs[bi]    - per job shared memory segment limit
jshmsize[bi]    - per job shared memory size limit
jsocbflim[bi]   - per job total socket buffer space
deflvl          - MLS default level
maxlvl          - MLS maximum level
minlvl          - MLS minimum level
intcls          - MLS integrity class
maxcls          - MLS integrity class maximum
defcomps        - MLS default compartment specifications
mincomps        - MLS minimum compartment specifications
comparts        - MLS authorized compartments
permits         - special UNICOS privileges
intcat          - MLS integrity categories
valcat          - MLS authorized categories
The [bi] marks those resources that may be different between
batch mode and interactive.
The accounting list is the same as this, except that they are taken
from a project list rather than a user list.
The MLS and privilege references are just for information that is
also carried as part of the accounting/security package in UNICOS.
They are not immediatedly useful to Linux (other than the RSBAC and
IPsec projects.
