I have a counter question for you.. what are you trying to do with the
"these two are SMT sibblings" information ?
Because I suspect "HT" is the wrong level of detection for what you
really want to achieve....
If you want to decide "shares caches" then at least 2.6 kernels directly
export that (and HT is just the wrong way to go about this).
