Umm...  OK.  There were some plans to add a notifier chain for such events
and EVMS looks like a possible user of that beast.  However, it's not
obvious whether we need to do any of that in the kernel - we definitely
can have userland up and running before _any_ block devices are initialized,
so it might be a work for userland helper.
Speaking of which...  Linus, mind if I start feeding initramfs stuff?

There's none.  We need some way to deal with that, but for that we need
at least sane and stable interfaces.  Right now _all_ "media changed"
stuff on the driver side is ad-hackery.

_Ouch_.  "Each" as in...?  E.g. do you want to do that for floppies?  Cdroms?
EVMS volumes themselves?  Things like /dev/loop? (and if yes, at which point
do you do that?)
