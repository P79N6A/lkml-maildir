Just for laughs, I ran the HINT benchmark program (see
http://www.scl.ameslab.gov/Projects/HINT/
 for details) on
Linux-2.2.1 and FreeBSD-3.0 using identical hardware and a 2.7.2
gcc.
To grossly simplify, this benchmark purports to measure performance
a wide range of problem sizes.  And sure enough, when run on FreeBSD
the performance curve shows the classic ``3-step'' drop-off when the
data size moves from cache to main memory to paging.  The Linux
graph is similar but with a much less clearly defined ``shape''
and the small-problem peak performance is about 15% less that FreeBSD.
(See 
http://www.cs.washington.edu/lab/sw/HINT/hintgraphs.html.
)
I don't plan on making a career of tracking down what is causing
this behavior, but the most likely thing would seem to be ``cache
trashing'' for whatever reason.  So I thought I would ask the
experts if any them knew off the top of their head what the likely
culprits could be -- or actually _are_, for that matter.
Thanks for satisfying my curiousity...
