Linux development has _always_ worked by:
1) You have a problem
2) You come up with a solution
3) Others use your patch, perhaps refine it
4) A discussion ensues on the worthyness of the patch
5) The community (or at least the halfgods in charge of keeping the Holy
   Source ;-) sees that the patch is worthwile, tested, and has enough
   users
6) After some further cleanups and fixes the patch is accepted into the
   kernel
7) The code is carried as part of the standard kernel, and updated with it
Being halfway through (2) or going on (3) and whining that _others_ do the
work to take care of finishing implementing a solution and then maintaining
it for you (jumping to (7)) won't get you anywehere. Guaranteed.
Perhaps your proposed solution is subobtimal.
Perhaps your problem is so outlandish that a solution has no place in the
standard kernel.
Perhaps solving the problem, even a common one, isn't worth the effort in
placing a solution in the kernel, and then maintaining it forever.
