Hello,
> Pass 'apm=smp-power-off' on the command line and it will power off for you.
BTW, if I do this, the board powers off, but after switching
back on, something in the initialisation makes the PS/2 port
dead. Keyboard works in LILO, but then even the SysRq does
not work. The first thing that spots something is wrong is gpm.
The reset button makes everything work again. There are
no unusual kernel messages.
2.2.13, Abit BP6, Genius NetMouse Pro, gpm 1.17.9 - no idea,
what happens here.
This is hardly kernel's fault, but perhaps there is something
that can be done about it?
Regards
