M386 says that the minimum CPU supported is the 386 - and all CPUs 
above are supported, too. E.g.:
config X86_PPRO_FENCE
        bool
        depends on M686 || M586MMX || M586TSC || M586 || M486 || M386
        default y
config X86_F00F_BUG
        bool
        depends on M586MMX || M586TSC || M586 || M486 || M386
        default y

Your approach as well as the approach I'm currently working on breaks
the current semantics that a plain M386 produces a kernel that runs on
all CPUs.
