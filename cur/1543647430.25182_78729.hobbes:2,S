I won't answer the question, but instead pose a future problem:  if 
drivers are to be added without patching anything, that implies that the 
kbuild makefile rules for the driver are also added without patching.
Personally I don't care about Config dependency checking...  they are 
not modified often enough to affect me, and even if they did, dependency 
checking based on changes to Config files can get ugly, AFAICS.  I just 
do a "bk -r co -Sq" and am done with it...
I didn't say life was easy ;-) ;-)
