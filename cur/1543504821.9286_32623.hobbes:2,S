Right now Intel has put extra instructions that were previously found
mostly in DSPs in their PIII.
This makes for a standard which is good, but I'm pretty sure it's covered
in copyrights and trademarks, which is bad for competition in CPU vendor
land.
Also, using one CPU with a lot of voodoo built in will make it
more expensive to manufacture then a more simple CPU with dedictated other
logic to do specialized things.
It's like an MPV, you can't make a car that can ship 12 kids, drive up a
sandy road with a 40 degree slope and drives 200 MPh with a fuel
consumption that will make the entire middle east bankrupt.
There wil always be a compromise for what is handy, affordable and easy to
implemen etc.
Things being what they are, I personally prefer to have some form of
variety, I don't need something that can calculate 32 lightsources and do
bumpmapping to write email, it's a waste of money.
Then again, this is my opinion, the market will decide in the end what
will be manufactured.

 There are three ways to get something done: (1) Do it yourself.
 (2) Hire someone to do it for you. (3) Forbid your kids to do it.
