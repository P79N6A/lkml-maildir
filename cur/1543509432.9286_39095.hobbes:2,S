Fine, we'll take your example.  Apologies if this looks like I'm dis'ing
or misrepresenting the GGI people.

Unless something has changed since I last looked at GGI a couple of months
back, they are not claiming that their code is ready for kernel inclusion.

Here's a selection:
 * they never produced a useful, stable kernel addition
 * (to the best of my knowledge) they never submitted complete patches to
   Linus
 * they took so long in doing this, that a bunch of other guys beat them
   to it
 * their sources are packaged in such a way that I need to patch a
   non-current kernel, _and_ fight their quirky build system

Maybe on Monday you had a good reason for claiming non-transparency, but
the very first response to your post was from Alan Cox, who explained
exactly what to do to get the patch integrated.

OK, I'll bite.  "Probably."
It "probably" comitted one or more of the following sins:
a) was formatted in an ugly manner
b) was encoded inconveniently
c) was submitted against a stable branch, or during a feature or code
   freeze
d) was submitted as a patch against an obsolete kernel and didn't merge
   trivially with the current one
e) affects core code (and thus potentially both performance and
   reliability) and
   + made it look ugly
   + was not able to be configured out
   + was a portability disaster
f) looked like crappy code
g) looked hacky
h) was not considered a useful, desirable or worthwhile feature
i) was not submitted at all
(I just need one more for a full 10 Commandments)
From my brief inspection of the 2.2.1 release, I suspect it to be guilty
of b,c,e and maybe even d.  It probably didn't do a and i.  The rest (f,
g and h) I don't know/haven't read enough to comment on, but nobody who
has been following Linux kernel development would claim that it looked in
a worthwhile state for Linus' approval if it violated nearly half of
these.

The development of epckpt is rather opaque to us.  Most of us haven't used
it, many of us haven't even heard of it.  Why should Alan throw a few
hundred k of new code into a stable branch when the maintainer won't even
provide a patch let alone one against a stable kernel?
If "edpin" won't merge Linus' patches, why should Linus merge his?
