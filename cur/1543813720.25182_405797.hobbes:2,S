Never mind - I am dumb enough to not realize I needed SCSI Disk in built or as 
modules copied over to proper place :)
It boots but I don't think DMA is in effect on the CDROM drive though - (I get  
3Mb/s transfer speeds from it.  LS of a 1500 file directory is too slow).  
dmesg says ata2  configured for UDMA/33 but doesn't seem like it has 
actually.

Hard disk is fine - gives around 31 Mb/S.
