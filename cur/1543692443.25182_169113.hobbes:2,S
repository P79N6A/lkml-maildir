For cases like this, where we use a kernel pointer and do the 
"set_fs(KERNEL_DS)" thing to mak ea user-pointer routing write to kernel 
space, I suggest casting the pointer instead of the function, along with a 
comment on the "set_fs()".
Basically, something like this instead:
  static int autofs_write(struct file *file, const void *addr, int bytes)
  {
	const void __user *data;
	...
	set_fs(KERNEL_DS);
	/* This cast is legal due to the set_fs()! */
	data = (const void __user *) addr;
	...->write(file, data, bytes);
	set_fs(old_fs);
  }
See? That makes the cast more obvious, and it also makes it obvious _why_ 
the cast from kernel->user pointer is ok in this case.
