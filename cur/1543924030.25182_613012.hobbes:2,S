Right, now I remember. 
The idea was to run the rest of the kernel at HZ=50 or so, nothing but
scheduling needs it anymore, and with this patch the scheduler doesn't
need it anymore either. Should be good for power. This new hrtick thing
only does a lot of ticks when there are a lot of runnable tasks, it
starts at 2 with a tick per latency/2.
