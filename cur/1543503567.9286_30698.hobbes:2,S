Make a 10meg /boot partition that is entirely below the 1024th cyl
boundary. This is a bios limitation.. Be thankful that you are not running
NT, it makes you put all of C: under 1024cyl..
Also, why is you / so big? You'll get better performance, fsck times, and
fragmentation control (from reducing lifetime mixture)..
