One thing is worth pointing out here.  If you do remove some drivers 
(like usb-storage), you may end up with a bloated configuration because 
the things they selected (like SCSI) won't get removed automatically.  
That's a disadvantage of using select.
Another disadvantage appears when somebody tries by hand to remove a 
component (like SCSI) and finds that it magically reappears.  Evidently 
something is selecting it, but there's no way to find out what.
