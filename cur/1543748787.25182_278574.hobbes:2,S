Subject: [PATCH] hisax: don't look at pci_dev->irq before calling pci_enable_device()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The hisax driver looks at dev_avm->irq before calling pci_enable_device(),
which means it requests the wrong IRQ.  This patch fixes it.
Thanks to Thorsten Doil for reporting the problem and testing the fix.
