Cool.  The premise of the thread was that you merely were checking for
uniqueness, not order.  That changes our answer...

I think all of us agree on this:  in 2.5, our solution is to have a
system domain number, which increases from zero each time you add sbus,
pci bus, isa bus, etc.
For 2.4, non-x86 arches first had to deal with PCI domains, so the
solution was to stick "arch-specific data" into pci_dev->sysdata, which
in some cases was the PCI domain number.
So, you have an ugly solution in drivers for 2.4 if you need to know PCI
domain for what reason, and a clean solution in 2.5.
