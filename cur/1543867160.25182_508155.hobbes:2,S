Andi,
It seems that the part that's not returning nanosecond is in the code 
below. I've modified it, and now stat() is returning st_mtim.tv_nsec 
correctly.
I've tested it on ext2 and reiserfs, and both seems to be working.
I don't know why "t.tv_nsec = 0;" was set in the code. Any idea?
Thanks,
Jeff.
