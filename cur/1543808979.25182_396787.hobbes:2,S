 Hello,
  this release of the new RTC subsystem has got
 a few locking issues fixed as well as new
 drivers for the Ricoh RS5C372A/B and
 Philips PCF8563/Epson RTC8564.
  Detection routines have been improved
 in some drivers, while some others now require
 a specific probe parameter in order to
 avoid spurious writes on I2C eeprom chips.
 As usual, your feedback is highly appreciated.
