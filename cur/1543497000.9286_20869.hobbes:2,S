Well, I've seen the problem on receive side, not on send side. It
would be more like tty_schedule_flip looking for buffer being nearly
full and trying to que into immediate in such case.
BUT: when I wrote 
my_schedule_flip(...)
{
	queue_task(&tty->flip.tqueue, &tq_immediate);
	mark_bh(IMMEDIATE_BH)
}
and used that instead of tty_schedule_flip, it did not seem to
help. (Am I doing something wrong?)
