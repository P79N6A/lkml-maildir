Ok, I think this is the wierd function that is declared static, whose 
symbol is exported, but is not declared in any .h file :)
I used that before, because I saw it inside the hrtimer.c file, but then 
gcc was puking on me, and I noticd the wierdness.

Yes. Those was in need of fixing. The first code I had was not working 
correctly with abs timers. Didn't have time to dig into it yet.
Will verify and fix today...

I simplify the error path. The fd does not need to be in place for the 
timer function to be correctly triggered.

The two error/exit paths are different. One need to free the ctx, while 
the other one simply to do an fput().

Ok, I will.

Duh, yeah. I use the locked version of wakeups. Will fix.
