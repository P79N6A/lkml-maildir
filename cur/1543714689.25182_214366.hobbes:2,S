BTW, now that we're on the topic of Radeon, could someone tell me how to 
tell the kernel the default resolution to use when initializing the 
console?
When using a CRT, it defaults to 640x480.  When I use my Planar PQ191 
19" 1280x1024 monitor, it defaults to 1024x768.  I want it to default to 
1280x1024.  There's a tool, fbset or something like that, which I can 
use AFTER bootup, but trying to put that into init causes all sorts of 
conflicts.  I need to be able to tell the kernel, either at compile time 
or on the boot command line.
Moving off topic, my cries for help from the XFree86 people also seem to 
have gotten lost in the flow of hundreds of usenet messages.  Try as I 
might, I cannot seem to get XFree86 to talk to my monitor at anything 
other than 60Hz.  Even though LCD monitors have a persistent image, 
increasing the frame rate CAN reduce motion blur slightly.
Thanks.
