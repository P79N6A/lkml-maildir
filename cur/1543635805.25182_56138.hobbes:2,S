Yes, I have read the cdrecord source.  As you may recall from the
bug reports I would send periodically, I maintained the Debian
cdrecord/cdrtools package from 1998 till late last year...

Yup.  It's very portable, and I know you are very proud of libscg.
For Linux you have made libscg work using the "broken Linux SCSI
generic driver", and you have gone to great lengths to describe
how much you hate it.

Lets step back a moment here.  The cdrecord package is not
responsible for making "Linux usable in general".  It is
responsible for writing data to CD-ROMs.  It is _not_ responsible
for driving scanners, hard drives, or enforcing policy on the
Linux kernel.
If you would throw away crdrecord's desire to do its own private
SCSI bus scanning, and throw away your attachment to addressing
devices only by host, channel, id, and lun a number of things
happen.  For starters, Linux devices don't have to be forced to
all be sitting on the SCSI bus.  You could use standard Linux
device names (i.e. /dev/hdc or /dev/scd0).  And you could still
send all the SCSI/ATAPI packet commands you want to the device
that was selected  using the CDROM_SEND_PACKET ioctl.
Ever look at the CDROM_SEND_PACKET ioctl?
