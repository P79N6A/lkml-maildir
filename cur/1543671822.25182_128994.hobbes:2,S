Just ignoring the idiot caller would seem better, IMHO. BUG is a little
extreme ;-) Personally I'm happy for clustered apic mode machines with
irqbalance *disabled* to just fail the call. With it enabled, they can just
fraggle the affinity for irqbalance, and be happy.

The hardware doesn't support arbitrary cpumasks. However, as long as
we're running irqbalance, it doesn't matter  - we only do one cpu at a time
anyway.
The existing code in the mainline kernel is wrong for platforms other than
clustered apic mode too. irqbalance is happily rotating us one cpu at a
time, and then we go along and put our big masky foot in the thing, and
splat it across multiple CPUs. If irqbalance is on, all we need to do is
set up the irqbalance mask, then force a rebalance immediately.
