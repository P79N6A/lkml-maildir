Hey... I just report what I find... ;)
I had to look at this code a bit for some SCTP cases as well and this
seems to be how it works.  Here a comment from the code for the case
of the DF bit being set
    /* This is only to work around buggy Windows95/2000
     * VJ compression implementations.  If the ID field
     * does not change, they drop every other packet in
     * a TCP stream using header compression.
