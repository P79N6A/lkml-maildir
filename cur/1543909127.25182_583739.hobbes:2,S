The only thing remotely relevant in the list config is that 'Filter out 
duplicate messages to list members (if possible)' is set as a default 
for new members.  Maybe this means that if a cc is also part of the 
list, that cc is stripped (which seems a wierd implementation; I'd have 
expected that cc be kept and just one copy sent out).
Anybody have a clue?
