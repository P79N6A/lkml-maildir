Cool stuff!

Sounds like a very good approach to me. I think the core code wants to be 
optimistic towards the non-presence of scheduling constraints. So as 
hardware improves and evolves [which we all hope it does], so will 
hopefully the constraint related overhead become smaller.

Great work Paul!
Do timec.c and kerneltop.c work fine for you by any chance? If yes, could 
you send us some sample output that you get with them on your power 
testbox(es)?
Also, would this be the right moment for me to pull from you?
Your modifications to kernel/perf_counter.c are all fixes and sensible 
extensions, and i expect the x86 side should continue to work just fine, 
so i'd like to pull this ASAP :-)
