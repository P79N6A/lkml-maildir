Right, gcc should be smarter in that case... hmm, I wonder if it warns

Actually I did mean that bvec_alloc_bs() only reads the value of *idx
after it has assigned a value to it, but ofcourse there's no way for
gcc to warn about the use inside that function since there it has to
assume that whatever value of the variable being passed as a pointer
is the intended one.
Of course bio_alloc_bioset() also only reads from idx after
bvex_alloc_bs() has initialized it which is why the warning is bogus.
