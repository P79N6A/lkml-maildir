So, NAPI or not we get userland stalls due to packetflooding.
Looking at some of the old patches we discussed privately, it seems
this is what was done earlier -
1. Use rcu-softirq.patch which provides call_rcu_bh() for softirqs
   only.
2. Limit non-ksoftirqd softirqs - get a measure of userland stall (using
   an api rcu_grace_period(cpu)) and if it is too long, expire
   the timeslice of the current process  and start sending everything to 
   ksoftirqd.
By reducing the softirq time at the back of a hardirq or local_bh_enable(),
we should be able to bring a bit more fairness. I am working on the
patches, will test and publish later. 
Thanks
