I rebooted (fsck took the fs errors away, no big offenders), and after a few
minutes, I got the same error ("journal commit I/O error"). So it doesn't
appear all that random memory corruption. The error happened right when I
logged out, but that might have been a coincidence. No ide nor md errors
this time either. 
I don't know what to suspect. What I gather from changelogs, there haven't
been any critical looking ext3 changes in 2.4 lately, but then again,
vserver doesn't mess with block layer / ext3 journalling either.
Any ideas?
