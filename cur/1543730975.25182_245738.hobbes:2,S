Judging from the feedback during it's stay in -mm (none at all!), general
interest in BSD accounting seems quite limited. The rate of downloads of
the updated userspace tools is hardly distinguishable from background
noise. (This might change with the correct URL in the help text now, but
even that was broken for months and nobody cared).
Also general interest in the user space tools is low, the latest release 
of the GNU acct package is from 1998 (and yes, there _are_ problems 
warranting updates).
Funnily enough, with three competing implementation even interest from
developers seems larger than that from users (This statement includes me,
I did a patch but am not a user of it).) But communication between
developers is poor. I for myself only recently learned about ELSA and CSA.
Therefore I've Cc:ed some people from whom I got valuable feedback on the
BSD accounting format patch.
IMHO CSA, ELSA and BSD accounting are too similar to have more than one of 
them in the kernel. We should either improve BSD accounting to do the job, 
or kill it in favor of a different implementation.
