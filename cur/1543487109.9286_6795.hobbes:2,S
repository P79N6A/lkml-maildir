Subject: 2.2.2: Socket Filtering compile failure

Dear team,
  1. Please CC to both of my email addresses; I am not subscribed to the
     list yet.
  2. Excuse me if this has been reported before.
  3. When compile kernel with Socket Filtering (CONFIG_FILTER),
     compilation failbs because the structure sk_filter is not defined.
  4. When do:
[root@nicksbox linux]# find . -name "*.c" -o -name "*.h" -exec fgrep -l
sk_filter {} \;
./include/net/sock.h
[root@nicksbox linux]# find . -name "*.c" -o -name "*.h" -exec fgrep
sk_filter {} \;
        struct sk_filter        *filter;
extern __inline__ int sk_filter(struct sk_buff *skb, struct sk_filter
*filter)
extern __inline__ void sk_filter_release(struct sock *sk, struct
sk_filter *fp)
        unsigned int size = sk_filter_len(fp);
extern __inline__ void sk_filter_charge(struct sock *sk, struct
sk_filter *fp)
        atomic_add(sk_filter_len(fp), &sk->omem_alloc);
        if (sk->filter && sk_filter(skb, sk->filter))
you can see that there is only a forward reference to sk_filter, at
least on my machine, but no definition.
   * This is needed for the ISC dhcp server dhcp-2.0b1pl14
   * When attempt to start dhcp server, get:
   * socket: Protocol not available - make sure CONFIG_PACKET and
     CONFIG_FILTER are defined in your kernel configuration!
     exiting.
   * The kernel appears to work well otherwise.
   * If I've missed something that is obvious to you, please let me
     know.
