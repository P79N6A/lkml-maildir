Why a new flag? IMHO it would be both more readable and more efficient
to create a pm_generic_nosuspend() function which does "return -ENOSYS",
and set that as the .suspend method on drivers known to break
suspend/resume. New drivers should either have .suspend and .resume
methods of their own or set .suspend = pm_generic_nosuspend.
That way, NULL .suspend/.resume methods retain their current semantics
("don't know whether suspend would work, never thought about it"),
error-returning ones would clearly signal "cannot suspend safely", and
success-returning ones would equally clearly signal "suspend works ok".
(Bugs nonwithstanding.)
There could then be a policy parameter (Kconfig selectable to start)
to abort suspend when encountering a driver without .suspend/.resume
methods, or to proceed with a warning message.
