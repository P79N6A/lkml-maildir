I have just compiled 2.6.22-rc2 with the configuration file given in my
previous post and the resulting kernel successfully boots on the machine
concerned.  Whatever broke LVM for this machine in between 2.6.18 and
2.6.21.1 has now been fixed.
There is still a problem with the CDROM but I will follow up in another
thread about that.
