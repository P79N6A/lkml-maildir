Is there any way of issuing a PCI reset (safely) without rebooting?  I am
developing a peripheral device (using a pci card with an FPGA and a plx9080
pci interface), and find that its local bus is prone to hanging up.  It
would be nice if I could just reset the entire device via the PCI reset,
without having to go through the hassle of a reboot.  Is this wishful
thinking?
