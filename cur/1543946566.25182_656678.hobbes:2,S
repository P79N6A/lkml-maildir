ok - have queued it up for v2.6.26. Note: Andrew might get grumpy when 
your PCI tree starts changing nearby places in arch/x86/pci again and it 
clashes with these changes in x86.git - in that case please pick up the 
full lot from x86.git#testing and carry it in the PCI tree. (or, 
alternatively, send me any trivial, arch/x86-only PCI bits to 
x86.git#testing so that we can keep it and test it all in a single place 
- whichever approach is more convenient to you)

i think the optimization should be more correct now than in the past, 
its purpose and dependencies just have not been communicated fully. 
We'll get there eventually :-)
