Subject: modules as drivers and the order of loading

As I was building 2.4.1 afresh I took the opportunity to build some of
the device drivers as modules.  In particular I have a SCSI cdrom
device (it actually is a cd writer) and I had made that and its
controller (Adaptec AIC-7xxx driver) modules.
However, during boot they fail to load because at the time they are
brought up VFS had not mounted the root filesystem
I am not sure why they can be built as modules if they then can't be
loaded?
OR have I completely misunderstood the approach here.
