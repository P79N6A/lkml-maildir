Can I have this snapshot pls? I have to deal with the same issue when 
the current task switches groups and I was planning to fix it by
introducing a set_curr_task() method in fair_sched_class which
initializes exec_start and other fields for that task.

hmm ..i was thinking of the case where currently running task belongs to 
fair_sched class but the raw_weighted_load field of runqueue includes
weight from real time tasks (which would have affected the delta_mine
calculation). Now I realize that it is not possible because real-time
tasks always preempt fair-sched tasks. So possibly this is not an issue.

Sure ..the unified weight number is usefull to pick the busiest
group/queue during load balance. I am retaining this aspect in my
patches (which I am preparing to send against -v15 atm).
