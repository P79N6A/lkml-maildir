Dropping the early return means nolapic is not honored in this
codepath. I realize it doesn't have much impact on the bug that
happens while nolapic is not passed. Thanks for fixing that.
Also, it should probably not have to clear X86_FEATURE_APIC from
boot_cpu_data.x86_capability, because lapic_disable() already did
so. Tracking down where that is being set (if it indeed is) when
enable_local_apic < 0 may be useful.
