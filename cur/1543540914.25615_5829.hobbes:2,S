Thanks for your response.  Actually the dd command is only a simplified
version of the real problem.  It appears that any big I/O operation slugs the
system.  The original problem was big SMB file writes over a 100MB/s link.
I have since found a tuning that seems to keep the system going fairly well.
I'm using:
echo "40 100 512 512 2000 3000 5000 1884 2" > /proc/sys/vm/bdflush
