Actually, you have it somewhat backwards.
In most cases, checking for NULL pointers (and returning an error
whatnot) is actually *more* likely to cause permanent damage than
having the kernel bomb out.  At least with the kernel bombing out you
won't keep grinding on a filesystem for which your kernel
datastructures are bad.  This is *IMPORTANT*.
