What you explain is exactly the reason, why libscg maps the /dev/ names
to something stable.
Then some people claimed that there was a new way in Linux but I could
not find a machine running this stuff.....
When I checked again, this still had not become "standard" on Linux
but I got the impression that somebody was developing a new system.
So I gave up.
If someone will develop a useful system that eventually appears as
a standard on all Linux systems it may make sende to add support into
libscg.
