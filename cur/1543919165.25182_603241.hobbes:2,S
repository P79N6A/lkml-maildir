I have 2 problems with this way:
1) It is totally broken because c->x86_capability is not an integer but
   an *array* of integers. This is also the reason why test_bit() is used
   in cpu_has() and not plain logical operators.
2) It is still hard to read and breaks the kernel coding style.
But you are right with the redundant mca and mce variables. They are not
needed and I will inline the cpu_has() checks into the condition check.
I'll resubmit tomorrow.
