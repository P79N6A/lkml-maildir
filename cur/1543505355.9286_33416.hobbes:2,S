Hi all!
 Seems we all miss the base_address very much ;-)
 This happens to me:
 gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/usr/src/linux/include -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -O2 -fomit-f
 rame-pointer -fno-strict-aliasing -pipe -fno-strength-reduce -mpreferred-stack-b
 oundary=2 -DCPU=586 -march=i586   -c -o ncr53c8xx.o ncr53c8xx.c
 ncr53c8xx.c: In function `pci_get_base_address':
 ncr53c8xx.c:9636: structure has no member named `base_address'
 make[3]: *** [ncr53c8xx.o] Error 1
 make[3]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/v2.3.13/linux/drivers/scsi'
 make[2]: *** [first_rule] Error 2
 make[2]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/v2.3.13/linux/drivers/scsi'
 make[1]: *** [_subdir_scsi] Error 2
 make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/v2.3.13/linux/drivers'
 make: *** [_dir_drivers] Error 2
 Command had non-zero exit status 2
 using:
 gcc-2.95 from official gnu site
 Would be nice if there would be a quick hack to make the pengo running!
 KEEP HACKING!
