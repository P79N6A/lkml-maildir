Yah.  This is what I originally did.  Because of the current
implementation of list_empty(), the race is never dangerous (e.g., no
segfault), we just get false positives/negatives, but that is no
different than the atomic check, really, since we can race in the
interim and then we go on and check the list anyhow.
So, let's do it.  I'll cook up a patch and updated inotify tomorrow, if
no one beats me to the punch.
