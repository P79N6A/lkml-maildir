Indeed.  I should not of lumped the last property in with the "things to
get rid of", although it is one of the implicit rules of the BKL.
We probably don't want to actually start disabling interrupts for no
reason when we grab the BKL. ;-)
Although the locks that replace the BKL can certainly be BKL-safe locks.

I agree.  Barring a few worst-case examples, I think the only reason
going forward to reduce the BKL's use is cleanliness and simplicity.  It
is rather hard at times to find just what the BKL is locking.
