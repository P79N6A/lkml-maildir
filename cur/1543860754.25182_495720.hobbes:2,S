Please read the code Jeff. The old IDE quirk code in the PCI layer blanked
BAR 0 to BAR 3 of a compatibility mode controller
You then request_region 0x1f0 and 0x170 (BAR 0 and BAR 2) directly. You
never request the legacy BAR 1 and BAR 3 because they were erased by the
PCI quirk code and thus never claim the other port. Thats been a bug since
day one but it never seemed worth fixing in the short term.
