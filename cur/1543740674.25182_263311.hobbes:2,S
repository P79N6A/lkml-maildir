Either port the driver to V4L2, which handles decompression stuff well,
or provide a separate downloadble GPL'ed module. Other drivers in the
mainline kernel observe this rule; the pwc case is not an exception.
Also, this matter has been already discussed many times in the v4l
mailing list: no video decompression at all in kernel space, even if
*optional* through an *indipendent* module. I doubt Morton or Linus will
ever accept this version of pwc driver, since they did accept a patch disabling
colorspace conversion from a driver recently.

It sounds logic that none would help to fix user applications, if
we kept including things like decompression in each module in the kernel.
If it ever happens that this driver is accepted, be also prepared to
accept patches adding decompression and colorspace conversions for
every video driver I am aware of, starting from the ones I have already
written to the ones I'll submit in the future.
