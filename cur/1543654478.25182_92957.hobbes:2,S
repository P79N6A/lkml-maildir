Subject: [PATCH] 2.5.50 conglomerate module fixes patch
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2002/11/29/26

The patches which are pending inclusion by Linus are rolled into one
file:
	
http://www
.[COUNTRY].kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/rusty/modules/2.5.50-patches.gz
This does not include the "calling request_module() from module init",
as I'm waiting for confirmation that that patch actually works.
Please report bugs to me.
Cheers,
Rusty.
