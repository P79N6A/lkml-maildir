What's unsafe about running hwclock before fsck? Since root is mounted
ro, what damage can be done?

At most half-hours (Adelaide, South Australia has a half-hour
timezone). But I think this is a bad idea. I remember all the trouble
we had with our Convex C220 where the OS and the SPU (Service
Processor Unit, pronounced "spew") each had their own timezone. It
caused no end of trouble. Admittedly it was because there was an
inconsistency in their timezone tables, but I still think it's a bad
idea.
Duplication of data is inherently fragile. It's to be avoided if at
all possible. The fsck case doesn't seem to justify the risk.
