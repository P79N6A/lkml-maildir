Subject: Problem and solution: 2.5 broke KDE panel (kpanel)

 When I tried KDE 3.0 on kernel 2.5.66 I got an exception message
from kpanel.  Everything else worked OK but there was no panel, so
it wasn't much fun.
 Solution: boot up 2.4 and remove applets from the panel.  The system
monitor seems to be the problem -- it faulted when I tried to add it
back (but the panel kept running.)
 In case anyone is interested, here's the backtrace I got when the
panel died in 2.5:
