I don't know really, but suppose that parport does not accept irq sharing.

This one is more interesting, probably special patch is necessary for conexant codec, let's see.
Please report bug to alsa and attach there output of 'lspci -vv' and tar of '/proc/asound' directory (or send to me).
Let's detach from linux-kernel list - things become pure-ALSA related.
Thanks,
Sasha.
