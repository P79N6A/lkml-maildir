Hmm, any chance of putting the spec/patches and .configs split out to
minimise downloads for those of us who already have the kernel archive?
Things I note that aren't there yet (or in rawhide from what I can see),
an lvm2 package - but I imagine that'll come in time.  The ipsec-tools
are in rawhide, but what you provide should be good for getting people
up and running.
I like the combined modutils patch, that seems more user friendly.
Cheers 
Paul
