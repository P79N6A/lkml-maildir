Subject: [PATCH] Fix log_do_checkpoint() assertion failure

  Hello,
  attached one liner fixes possible false assertion failure in
log_do_checkpoint(). We might fail to detect that we actually made a
progress when cleaning up the checkpoint lists if we don't retry after
writing something to disk. The patch was confirmed to fix observed
assertion failures for several users. Please apply.

When we flushed some buffers we need to retry scanning the list.
Otherwise we can fail to detect our progress.
