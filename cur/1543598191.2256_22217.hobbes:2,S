Hi,
recently I did an upgrade of my old computer (ASUS SP97-V) to
the kernel-2.4.7.
Problem:
  My system was crashing even when I load the module ide-disk.o
Solution:
  Because of the broken hardware (some UDMA problems with an non
  UDMA-Cabel to the drive) the linux kernel hangs during ide_dma_check.
  Even if UDMA is disabeld in the bios, the kernel detect this drive as
  an udma drive. And this is wrong!!
  My solution was simply to comment out the ide_dma_check in ide.c.
  You can find this patch as attachment.
Frank
