PS: on my testbox it happens without apparent corruption of (printed) code.
However, %eip it prints _is_ odd - it's in the middle of pushing arguments
for second pci_read_config_dword() in pci_read_bases().  And AFAICS there's
no way in hell it could be legitimate - what I'm seeing is
(from  pci_write_config_dword(dev, reg, 0); )
        pushl $0
        pushl %edi
        movl 32(%esi),%eax
        pushl %eax
        movl 16(%esi),%eax
        pushl %eax
        call pci_bus_write_config_dword
        addl $16,%esp
(from pci_read_config_dword(dev, reg, &l0); )
        leal 24(%esp),%eax
        pushl %eax
        pushl %edi
        movl 32(%esi),%eax
        pushl %eax
        movl 16(%esi),%eax
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        pushl %eax
        call pci_bus_read_config_dword
        addl $16,%esp
and we die on the underlined (%eip points to push %eax).  %esp is reasonable,
so is %esi (and we had just dereferenced both).
I'm at loss on that one - if somebody has bright (heck, any) ideas, you
are welcome.
