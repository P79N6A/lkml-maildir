I did a pile of testing in pre11 with all sorts of people who bothered
to test it
0.89H hangs occasionally
0.89H + fix  wasn't hanging for those folks 0.89H worked for
0.91 broke for numerous users and worked for numerous others - not acceptable
0.91g has "testing" on it. So even Donald doesn't trust it. You want me to
put that in a stable kernel. Not unless Donald says so.
