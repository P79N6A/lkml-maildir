Subject: hugepage: Move hugetlb_free_pgd_range() prototype to hugetlb.h
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The optional hugepage callback, hugetlb_free_pgd_range() is presently
implemented non-trivially only on ia64 (but I plan to add one for
powerpc shortly).  It has its own prototype for the function in
asm-ia64/pgtable.h.  However, since the function is called from
generic code, it make sense for its prototype to be in the generic
hugetlb.h header file, as the protypes other arch callbacks already
are (prepare_hugepage_range(), set_huge_pte_at(), etc.).  This patch
makes it so.
