The point is why store kernel pointers in global registers when You can
achieve the same functionality, with a smaller patch, that does not need
to be recoded for each CPU, without using global registers.

This is the diff for current :
 static inline struct task_struct * get_current(void)
 {
-       struct task_struct *current;
-       __asm__("andl %%esp,%0; ":"=r" (current) : "0" (~8191UL));
-       return current;
+       unsigned long *tskptr;
+       __asm__("andl %%esp,%0; ":"=r" (tskptr) : "0" (~8191UL));
+       return (struct task_struct *) *tskptr;
 }
