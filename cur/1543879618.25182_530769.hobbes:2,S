you have a point, but note that the macro "PM_IS_ACTIVE" is *defined*
in the header file "linux/pm_legacy.h".  so if that macro is still
essential, its definition will have to be moved elsewhere, no?
my approach was to rip out everything that seemed to be related
to pm_legacy.h, so if that macro disappears, then any references to it
must similarly disappear.
can someone clarify this?  if only one of APM or ACPI can be enabled,
they should find a way to agree on that without needing legacy code to
do it.
