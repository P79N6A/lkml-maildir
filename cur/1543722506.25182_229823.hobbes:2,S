Hi !
The exception rewrite contains a small bug that prevents bring up of CPUs
on logically partitioned machines. The kernel is trying to zero the backlink
on the new stack while running with relocation disabled, which potentially
cause it to try to access an address outside of the region allowed in
real mode. This seem to be a leftover from previous code as we also zero
the backlink later after turning off the MMU. This patch removes the
offending bit.
