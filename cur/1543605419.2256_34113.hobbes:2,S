Not needed. Any address assigned to an "internal" device (tun/tap, dummy,
etc) is pingable and arpable from any other address on the system
(assuming rp_filter is set correctly per interface). I use this "feature"
all the time and there was even a big argument over "loose vs. strict"
host replies back in the Spring of 2001 about this.

If an IP address is routed to on the external network then it will be
available. It does _not_ matter what interface that address is assigned
to. EX:
ip addr add 10.1.1.1/24 dev dummy0
ip link set dev dummy0 up
now ping 10.1.1.1 from another machine on eth0 that has an appropriate
route. I suspect what is really biting you is that your rp_filters are way
too restrictive on your machine.
