Well, there's also the fact that Linux does *NOT* need suidperl, as  
it has proper secure support for suid pound-bang scripts anyways.   
The only reason for suidperl in the first place was broken operating  
systems which had a race condition between the operating system  
checking the suid bits and reading the '#! /usr/bin/perl' line in the  
file, and the interpreter getting executed and opening a different  
file (think symlink redirection attacks).  I believe Linux jumps  
through some special hoops to ensure that can't happen.
