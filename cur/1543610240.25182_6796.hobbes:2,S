The great thing about the C standard is that you don't have to know, or guess,
or remember.  I respectfully suggest that all of those who are interested in
this topic buy a copy of K&R Second Edition (ISBN 0-13-110370-9), and read
chapter 2, particularly section 2.12 "Precedence and order of Evaluation".
And take this facinating topic off-line.
