They provide no information to the human reader, but they tell klogd
(and other tools) that the enclosed value is a kernel address that
should be looked up in the System.map file and decoded into name +
offset.

What a bad idea to remove them.

What happened to the tabs?  It looks like you're using the deadly evil
quoted-printable mime encoding format which seems to h ave spannered the
patch.

IMHO, panic here is a better idea; I've had many a time when I get oops
after oops.  Take for instance "scheduling in interrupt".  This causes
a NULL pointer de-reference, which then calls die() which goes on to call
do_exit() which then calls schedule() which then causes a NULL pointer
de-reference, which then calls die() which goes on to call do_exit() which
then calls schedule() which then causes a NULL pointer de-reference etc.
End result is a constant stream of oopsen fast scrolling by on screen until
such time something gets corrupted which breaks the loop.
PS, if you want to catch an oops which locks the machine, use a serial
console to log it.  If its a non-locking oops, examine the message log.
