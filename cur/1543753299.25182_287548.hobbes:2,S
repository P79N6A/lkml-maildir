Unfortunately ia64 breaks (3).  They have pinned TLB entries covering
64k, which they put the static per-cpu data into.  This is used for
local_inc, etc, and David Mosberger loved that trick (this is why my
version allocated from that first reserved block for modules' static
per-cpu vars).
Hope that clarifies,
Rusty.
