As far as I'm concerned, so far this is just playing around with
affinity (and to some extents taking it too far, on purpose). For
instance, my current patch can move submissions and completions
independently, with a set mask or by 'binding' a request to a CPU. Most
of that doesn't make sense. 'complete on the same CPU, if possible'
makes sense and would fit fine with multi-queue hw.
Moving submissions at the block layer to a defined set of CPUs is a bit
silly imho, it's pretty costly and it's a lot more sane simply bind the
submitters instead. So if you can set irq affinity, then just make the
submitters follow that.
