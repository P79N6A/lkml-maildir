Why not just declare ext2_i like the following?  It _should_ work:
static inline struct ext2_inode_info *ext2_i(const struct inode *inode)
{
	return &(inode->u.ext2_inode_info);
}
Minor nit: this is already done for the ext3 code, but it looks like:
#define EXT3_I	(&((inode)->u.ext3_i))
We already have the EXT3_SB, so I thought I would be consistent with it:
#define EXT3_SB	(&((sb)->u.ext3_sb))
Do people like the inline version better?  Either way, I would like to make
the ext2 and ext3 codes more similar, rather than less.
Cheers, Andreas
