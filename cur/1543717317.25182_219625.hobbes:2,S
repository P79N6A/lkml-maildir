Subject: [PATCH] bug in 2.4.26 mm/memory.c:map_user_kiobuf
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi,
get_user_pages can in some circumstances return less than a complete 
mapping, without giving an error code. This fools map_user_kiobuf which 
loops over the assumed number of pages in the mapping, calling 
flush_dcache_page on all of them, which is not very good if the maplist is 
not fully populated. It also fools drivers using map_user_kiobuf and which 
also assume that you get a complete mapping (or an error code). Actually, 
iobuf->nr_pages is reduced to reflect the incomplete mapping, but 
iobuf->length is not, so I don't really know what the desired behaviour is
in the kernel<->driver communication.
Anyway, the flush loop is incorrect, and it probably doesn't hurt to 
restrict map_user_kiobuf so it returns -ENOMEM if get_user_pages can't 
return the full amount of pages, to avoid surprises downstream. 
get_user_pages seem to behave in this way during severe memory-shortage, but 
also (and more importantly) when a page-limited tmpfs is used as a substrate 
for an mmap and map_user_kiobuf and the page/size limit is hit.
