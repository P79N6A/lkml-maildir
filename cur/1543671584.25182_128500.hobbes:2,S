My hauppage BT848 card with the stock kernel driver seems to occasionally 
after reboot (warm, or poweroff under a few seconds) continue to write to
memory.
It's not the motherboard or RAM (changed from a PPRO 240, to a Duron 1300
with different RAM).
When this happens with the first motherboard, it failed POST (sometimes) 
and memtest would reveal memory errors in the top few meg of RAM.
(16-40Mb of RAM installed) 
On the second motherboard, it unfortunately got past POST once, and 
proceeded to shred a filesystem when checking it.
Any thoughts?
