And do you guys actually use a recent glibc snapshot? Do you ever expect 
to? Do you ever expect to run a third-party specialized web-server or 
database library? All things that can use futex'es, and probably will. 
I will strongly argue against making futexes conditional, simply because I 
_want_ people to be able to depend on them in modern kernels. I do not 
want developers to fall back on SysV semaphores just because it's too 
painful for them to use the faster alternatives.
