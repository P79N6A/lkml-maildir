Ok.  Cool.  If this is not a problem, that's good to know.

I'm aware of this.

That PS was about putting up a kernel doc web page, not about the existing 
kernel Documentation tree.
The existing Documentation tree has, at the top level, coding style 
guidelines, files documenting the kernel community, a file documenting the 
Amiga "zorro" bus, a half-dozen files about old multiport serial cards, 
documentation about several different types of locking, a penguin graphic 
from 1996, your documentation on the tty layer, a document on how to 
configure BINFMT_MISC to autorun .NET files with mono, and zillions of other 
random unrelated topics that are sorted based on where random passerby put 
things down last.
I sent a couple patches to shuffle stuff around in there but it got lost on 
the noise.  More to the point, an HTML index can hotlink but text files have 
a harder time doing that, so if I'm making an HTML index it's probably best 
to link to the text files but not attempt to navigate with them.
