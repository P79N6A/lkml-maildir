Hi All
I was in a situation where I could really simplify many things by
using down_interruptible() with a timeout. I went around looking for
how could one be implemented and ran away from the asm code in arch/.
At the end I realized I could make a simple one by setting up a timer
that would 'fake' a sigpending situation (setting the task's TIF_SIGPENDING
bit) so that the __down_interruptible_failed() path would quit when 
the timer went off.
I gave it a quick try (must admit, not too tested) and it seems that
the setting of TIF_SIGPENDING without really having a signal queued
is not having easily visible ugly consequences.
Does anybody have suggestions on how to alternatively implement this?
Thanks,
