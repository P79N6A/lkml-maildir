| Subversion and BK are quite different. The first one is snapshot
| oriented and the latter is changeset oriented (I find this a more
| powerful concept). Subversion is not distributed (you have some helper
| scripts but I don't know how stable they are), which is somehow
| mandatory for the way Linux is developed. Subversion also lacks any
| smart merging capabilities (it doesn't even remember what was
| merged).

well yes, I never searched for a distributed VCS, thats why I never
tried GNU Arch not so much (but I have to say, that it has hyper complex
command line options, perhaps darcs might be better).
Furthermore I sadly have to admit that I don't know the exact difference
between snapshot and changeset oriented. I just know that subversion has
~ Atomic comits and it works more than fine for me :)
Perhaps somebody can point me out to some Documentation about that (can
be in PM and not to the list)
