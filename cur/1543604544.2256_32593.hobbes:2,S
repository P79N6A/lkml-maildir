Yes- with certain select drivers with ad hoc interfaces. None in the current
tree I believe- although I haven't looked real closely lately.
There was one for aha1540 from years ago, and I've got the stubs of one for
parallel SCSI and Fibre Channe for QLogic cards. Repeat: "stubs"- it's not
completed engineering.
The current SCSI framework doesn't understand incoming commands or what to do
with them, hence the ad hoc nature of all target mode support. FreeBSD's CAM
layer does, btw.
