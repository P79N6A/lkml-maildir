Is there a way to control the order in which modules get loaded? For
example, I usually blacklist the parport module and only load it when
I need it, thus freeing an IRQ (for audio, IIRC). If parport loads
automatically, it grabs the IRQ; if it loads after the IRQ is grabbed
already, it'll resort to polled mode. Can these things be controlled
without the blacklist?
