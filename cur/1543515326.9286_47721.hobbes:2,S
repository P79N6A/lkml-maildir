getblk doesn't lock buffer. It only increments reference count. The caller

There can be pending read request if
- user reads device directly, or
- filesystem uses asynchonous i/o (breada or ll_rw_block)

Look at the code:
struct buffer_head * getblk(kdev_t dev, int block, int size)
{
        struct buffer_head * bh;
        int isize;
repeat:
        bh = get_hash_table(dev, block, size);
        if (bh) {
                if (!buffer_dirty(bh)) {
                        bh->b_flushtime = 0;
                }
                return bh;
        }
...
There is not (and should not be) any serialization in getblk. The
filesystem should call wait_on_buffer(bh), after getblk()ing, but it
doesn't.
