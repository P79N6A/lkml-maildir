Hi.  I have a weird problem -- maybe its iptables, but I am using the
log target and they print at legvel 4, but I only want level 3 or
less to print on the console, so I did 'dmesg -n 3' but I am still
getting the iptables messages.
I thought I could do this all with syslog.conf, but that has never
worked.
Any assistance would be appreciated.
