Jeff, are you using the e820 memory map at all ?  In particular, are you
using grub or some other buggy bootloader that insists on specifying a
mem= option on the kernel command line ?  There should be a kernel command
line message very early on, what does that say ?
Also, can you give us the E820 memory map (kernel messages starting with
BIOS-e820) ?
