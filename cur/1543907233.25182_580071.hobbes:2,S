We have an Asrock K7VT4A+ board with VT8235 southbridge in our lab and it
does have an HPET. Just because the datasheet does not document HPET does
not mean it is not implemented.
My guess is that newer revisions of VT8235 have HPET whereas older revisions
do not. I'll get an lspci dump from our box tomorrow.
Cheers,
