OK, I took a closer look at the IDE identification innards.
It's quite easy to call hwif->ata_input_id() instead of hwif->ata_input_data()
for reading the drive ID. Then hwif->ata_input_id() can take care of the
byteswapping for hardwired byteswapped IDE busses.
However, there's also a routine that involves more magic:
taskfile_lib_get_identify(). While trying to understand that one, I found more
commands that should call the (possible byteswapping) hwif->ata_input_id()
operations, like SMART commands. So first we need a clearer differentiation
between commands that transfer on-platter data, or other drive data.
Any comments from the IDE experts?
