It would be better to look for any PCI bridge. Sometimes there are
different PCI bridges around (e.g. external PCI-X bridges on HT systems) 
which might need own quirks
Also in the x86 world Microsoft defined a FADT ACPI flag that MSI doesn't
work for Vista. It might make sense to do
if (dmi year >= 2007 && FADT.msi_disable not set) assume it works

The FADT bit should be probably checked anyways.
