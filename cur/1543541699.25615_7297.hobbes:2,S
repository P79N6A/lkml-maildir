	Real "interoperability" for me would mean network EA aware
	filesystems. Since we are NFS [auto]mounting FrameMaker,
	StarOffice & Co from a server, EAs would be lost even if
	the server had an EA aware local filesystem.
	Maybe could it be a useful extension to the forecoming
	NfsV4 implementation...
