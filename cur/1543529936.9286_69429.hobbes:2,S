/dev/shm would be much more appropriate.  It should be possible to
mount on top of devfs just like any other filesystem, although devfs
of course needs to make the mount point appropriately.
/dev in fact would probably be the correct location these things,
being a kernel interface.
HOWEVER, sometimes avoiding "root directory cluttering" seems to be a
little too much of a goal in itself.  Sometimes adding items at the
root is entirely appropriate.
