The message triggers on systems without Cardbus at all.

I wouldn't say totally broken. The last 5 computers I've owned have had this 
message. On only one could it even *remotely* be related to CardBus (my one 
year old laptop), and on one of them it does create problems for certain 
(NVidia) binary drivers. (and then pci=assign-busses doesn't do jack to clear 
the message)
I'm not saying that binary drivers shouldn't be broken - but...
