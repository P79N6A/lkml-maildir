It will not break anything, and it is trivial to write an application to
intelligently handle KEY_UNKNOWN+scancode events.  This really is not a
reason to not do it, at all.

I had this exact PoV, too, until Dmitry reminded me that keycodes are
*global* to the system in practice, and that different keys (as in keys that
have no correlation between their position, labels or lack thereof, and
function) in different input devices would end up mapped to KEY_PROGx by
default.
And in that scenario, KEY_UNKNOWN (i.e. "please remap me to what you want
this key to do for real") makes a lot more sense, given that we don't have
all the positional keycodes we need, and more are not being added.
