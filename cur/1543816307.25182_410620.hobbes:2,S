So getting this code into Andrews development tree (as long as he is willing
to accept it) looks very reasonable.  We can't change the interface
once we get into the stable kernel because that becomes part of the
ABI.
So all I am saying is that this code is clearly not yet ready for
the stable branch, because we plan to change the sysctl interface.

Separating the patches makes a lot of sense.  Putting something into
the kernel without any in tree users is a problem.
