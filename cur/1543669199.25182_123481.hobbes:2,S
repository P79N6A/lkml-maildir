Yes.  It's a PITA that the bottom 8 bits map to exec_domain, and the
rest are random flags.  If each different personality mapped to a
separate exec_domain, the flags could be moved to the exec_domain
struct and it'd be far more logical.  But as you say, this would break
userspace which expects to be able to set the exec_domain and the
flags separately 8(.
BTW, there's a module refcount leak here:
int
__set_personality(u_long personality)
{
	struct exec_domain	*ep, *oep;
	ep = lookup_exec_domain(personality);
	if (ep == current_thread_info()->exec_domain) {
		current->personality = personality;
		return 0;
	}
You need "module_put(ep->owner)", since lookup_exec_domain bumps the
refcount.

No, then you can't access your files, which is unacceptable for many
users.
I've done the userspace implementation: I'll see if Fabrice chokes on
the speed hit.
Cheers,
Rusty.
