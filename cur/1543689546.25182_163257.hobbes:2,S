Maybe the other people working on Linux feel different, but I just don't
care about the masses and about anybody's commercial success. If they like
using Windows, well, they deserve it. I'm helping to create a system _I_
and the people around me like.
About drivers: People around me who are using Windows do have many
problems (want to use three different USB scanners simultaneously? eh,
forget about that), people using Linux have slightly less or maybe the
same amount of problems, but guess what -- for the Linux users there
usually is somebody around who knows how to fix the things while Windows
users are helplessly reinstalling their binary-only stuff nobody really
understands. That's a real story and I guess it's a very typical one.
And it's the reason why almost nobody here likes binary-only drivers.

Well, you can multiply the number of insects in this universe by their
working time and get an even larger number, but does that mean anything
except you are skilled in arithmetic?
				Have a nice fortnight
