Is "maintain your own operating system" really better in your mind? Does 
that sound like a viable alternative?
It's not old hardware that's the problem, it's new hardware which isn't 
supported. And unlike desktops, there's a lot less in the way of 
hardware options on a lappie, you take what you get, you get what you 
can afford, and often that means running on what someone else chooses.
