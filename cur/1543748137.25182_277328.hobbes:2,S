I'd like to report a slight improvement in the reports from tvtime
while running 32-6 with full preemtion turned on, cfq scheduler:
------
Dec  7 13:29:39 coyote kernel: wow!  That was a 15 millisec bump
Dec  7 13:29:39 coyote kernel: `IRQ 8'[838] is being piggy.
need_resched=0, cpu=0
Dec  7 13:29:39 coyote kernel: Read missed before next interrupt
-----
Each second of the log contains about 27 of these, so its pretty
steady.  Picture looks pretty good though.
Although, that particular snip was taken from the log while I was
*not* on the same screen as tvtime.  Switching back it its screen
returned the slip times to the 22 millisecond area.  And on quiting,
this was output:
-----------------
Dec  7 13:29:47 coyote kernel: rtc latency histogram of {tvtime/4038,
7565 samples}:
Dec  7 13:29:47 coyote kernel: 3 401
Dec  7 13:29:47 coyote kernel: 4 3348
Dec  7 13:29:47 coyote kernel: 5 1104
Dec  7 13:29:47 coyote kernel: 6 435
Dec  7 13:29:47 coyote kernel: 7 294
Dec  7 13:29:47 coyote kernel: 8 246
Dec  7 13:29:47 coyote kernel: 9 236
Dec  7 13:29:47 coyote kernel: 10 241
Dec  7 13:29:47 coyote kernel: 11 301
Dec  7 13:29:47 coyote kernel: 12 232
Dec  7 13:29:47 coyote kernel: 13 146
Dec  7 13:29:47 coyote kernel: 14 52
Dec  7 13:29:47 coyote kernel: 15 9
Dec  7 13:29:47 coyote kernel: 16 4
Dec  7 13:29:47 coyote kernel: 17 2
Dec  7 13:29:47 coyote kernel: 19 1
Dec  7 13:29:47 coyote kernel: 20 1
Dec  7 13:29:47 coyote kernel: 23 1
Dec  7 13:29:47 coyote kernel: 24 1
Dec  7 13:29:47 coyote kernel: 4545 1
Dec  7 13:29:47 coyote kernel: 9999 509
So there not much real change after all. Heavy duty wishfull thinking
I guess.  How can I decode the above output into english?
