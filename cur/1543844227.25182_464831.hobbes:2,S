I thought the fake NUMA support still does not work on x86_64 baseline
kernel.  Though Paul and Andrew have patches to make it work.

So now we depend on getting memory hot-plug to work for faking up these
nodes ...for the memory that is already present in the system. It just
does not sound logical.

I think when you have 100's of zones then cost of allocating a page will
include checking cpuset validation and different zone list traversals
and checks...unless there is major surgery.

Am not clear how is this possible.  Could you or Paul please explain.

I agree that we will need one container subsystem in the long run.
Something that can easily adapt to different configurations.
