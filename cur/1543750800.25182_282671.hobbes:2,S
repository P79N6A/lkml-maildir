After 2.6.9-ac its clear that the long 2.6.9 process worked very badly.
While 2.6.10 is looking much better its long period meant the allegedly
"official" base kernel was a complete pile of insecure donkey turd for
months. That doesn't hurt most vendor users but it does hurt those
trying to do stuff on the base kernels very badly.
