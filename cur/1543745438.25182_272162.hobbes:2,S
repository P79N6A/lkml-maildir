Ok, that's a pretty race.
However, I'm wondering whether this is the proper approach. After all, a
lazy-tlb process should never have any reason to flush its TLB, since "its
TLB" just aint there, and it ends up flushing somebody elses.
So I assume that this happens only with kswapd or similar? It really might 
be interesting to make the "we were a lazy tlb, and we're flushing 
somebody else" case do a stack dump, because I _suspect_ that this really 
is a special thing, and maybe the right thing to do is to make it special 
in _that_ path.
Very impressive debugging, btw. That must have been painful.
