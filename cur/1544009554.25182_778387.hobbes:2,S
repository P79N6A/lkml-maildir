Stupid question --- if you're worried about cacheline ping-pongs, why
aren't each cpu's delta counter cacheline aligned?  With a 64-byte
cache-line, and a 32-bit counters entry, with less than 16 CPU's we're
going to be getting cache ping-pong effects with percpu_counter's,
right?  Or am I missing something?
