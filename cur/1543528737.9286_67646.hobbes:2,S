Okay, thanks for the report. THis looks like a mode2 disc and probably
the MCN is not being liked very much for some reason. I've seen that
on my 6416SX as well.
I've spending today in bed because of sickness, I will update the
packet module later this week as I have a whole bunch of fixes in
my queue.
Also, there's now a dedicated list for the packet writing module:
packet-writing@suse.com . Subscribe by writing to packet-writing-subscribe,
although I'm not sure that it is up yet.
