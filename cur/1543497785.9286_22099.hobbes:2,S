	Hi,
	I read the source code (sched.c) and i think FIFO and RoudRobin 
are used in RealTime aplications, is that right??
	When the FIFO, RoudRobin schedule algoritms are used??? I think
they ar used on operations with I/O. 
	I need to know because i'll add a realtime schedule to Linux to do
my project in University.
	What's the diference about the realtime in Linux and the
realtime in BeOs???
	Thank's and bye.
