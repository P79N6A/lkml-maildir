I've not found a mailing list specifically intended for Linux NFS
problems. If there's a more appropriate place for me to be asking this
question, then please let me know.
At work I have a Linux Intel NFS client mounting from an HP-UX 10.20
server. The Linux client is RedHat 6.1, and has the following packages:
    kernel-2.2.12-20
    knfsd-1.4.7-7
    knfsd-clients-1.4.7-7
The mounts use the following options:
    nosuid,nodev,soft,timeo=20,retrans=7,rsize=8192,wsize=8192
My problem is that messages like the following occasionally are written to
the system console:
    NFS: server host-name, readdir reply truncated
    NFS: nr=172, slots=4, len=11
    NFS: server host-name, readdir reply truncated
    NFS: nr=154, slots=6, len=14
What might be causing this diagnostic? Is it a warning or an error? How
might I trace its cause, and what might I try to resolve it?
