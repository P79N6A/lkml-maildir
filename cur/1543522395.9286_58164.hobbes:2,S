Hi,
I don't know what kernel you all are using or PCMCIA code revision
level. But, on my laptop with RH6.1 (2.2.12-20) and lastest PCMCIA
code, I too had problems with the modem on my CBEM56G-100 - I just
couldn't "talk" to the modem. On some other "message board" I found
the workaround:
% setserial /dev/modem irq 0   # switch to polling
% setserial /dev/modem irq 3   # back to interrupts
After doing this the modem works just fine! Hopefully this will
help you (or somebody else).
