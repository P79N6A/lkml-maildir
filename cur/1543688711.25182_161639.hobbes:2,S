This driver is compiled with -Werror turning ever warning into an error.
Although you say you are using "linux-2.4.22" it seems you aren't using 
the ftp.kernel.org 2.4.22 but a modified version (the real 2.4.22 
doesn't know about -march=pentium4).
Perhaps your vendor of this modified kernel source introduced a bug 
causing this compile error?
