I tried the beta bios mentioned in Tyan's FAQ, but it didn't help with
the booting problem I have with 8GB ram.  I did however find that I can
boot up the machine if I add "maxcpus=0" to the kernel options in the
bootloader.  Of course then only one cpu works, which is just as bad as
the other solution of having only half the memory...
