	Hello,
	I'm testing 2.3.18ac5 and everything works pretty good but when I 
try to mount a ZIP disk the system just hangs up, no error report, no 
oops, nothing. It seems that it happen whenever you try to access the 
device, because if I insert the ZIP before booting, when it get to report 
/dev/sdc capabilities it also hangs up.
	If you need more info ask for it, please.

PS: I have an internal SCSI ZIP disk attached to an AIC7890 onboard (on 
a SuperMicro P6DGU) and I have no IDE devices (2 SCSI disks and 2 SCSI 
CD/CDR)
