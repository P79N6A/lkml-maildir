Just to pick a nit: there is no way to be sure a membership event might not 
still be on the way to the dead node, however the rest of the cluster knows 
the node is dead and can ignore it, in theory.  (In practice, only (g)dlm and 
gfs are well glued into the cman membership protocol, and other components, 
e.g., cluster block devices and applications, need to be looked at with 
squinty eyes.)
