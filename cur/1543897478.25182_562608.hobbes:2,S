Looks like you're applying patches out of order.  This is from the
14th, while a patch from the 13th ("UML - xterm driver tidying") has
-       pid = run_helper(NULL, NULL, argv, &stack);
	...
+       pid = run_helper(NULL, NULL, argv, NULL);
If you don't want to fiddle with this, just drop it and I'll rediff
against the next -mm and resend.
