Fine, but we can bind the event watching to the device or socket or pipe
that will clog up, right?  In which case, we'll later get a write event
(just like with select()), and then once there is some progress you can
go back to read()ing from the original descriptor.  This is even easier
than using select() because you don't have to take the descriptor out of
the read set and put it in the write set temporarily -- it will
automatically work that way.

Assuming this "resource" has a way of waking up the process when it
unclogs, then you can go back and read the remaining data later, which is
what you would want to do anyway.

I can see that you could write it this way... I'm just trying to see if
it's really needed. :)
As I wrote in my last email to Jamie, you would need to implement a
tracking mechanism in any case to avoid DoS attacks from clients or a
case where a single client can clog up the reading from any other client. 
And you'd need to take the descriptor out of the read() set in the
select() case anyway, so I don't really see what's different.

I'll go and read it now. :)
