Function kernel_thread() on i386 is implemented by putting the args to 
appropriate regs and calling int 0x80, resulting in a system call 
clone() on i386.
I have also found the "syscall" instruction in x86-64 kernel specific 
code (it does not call _syscall() macros directly, though). So, 
"shouldn't do" is a bit too strong.
What I am writing is an application, and not interface. As such, it is 
not much different from its requierements from a user-space application. 
If user-space application may call system calls, why a kernel space 
application cannot?
And BTW, kernel-space applications have their own place even if the 
concept seems foreign to you.
