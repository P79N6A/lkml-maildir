Preprocessed output for arch/ppc/kernel/irq.c includes this:
cpumask_t irq_affinity [256 ] =
        { [0 ... 256 -1] = ({   cpumask_t __tmp__;      (( __tmp__
).mask[0])  =  1 ;   __tmp__;        })    };
AFAICT it's starting from this:
cpumask_t irq_affinity [NR_IRQS] =
        { [0 ... NR_IRQS-1] = DEFAULT_CPU_AFFINITY };
and NR_IRQS-1 is becoming 256, DEFAULT_CPU_AFFINITY is becoming
cpumask_of_cpu(0). Then cpumask_of_cpu(0) is getting transformed some
more (I haven't quite figured out what's going on there).
Does this help at all?
