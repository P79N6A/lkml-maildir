Nothing about the patch is only about migration.
The same applies if you configure a kernel from scratch.
Do "make menuconfig" with the .config you are normally using, count the 
number of options that are visible, and ask yourself whether we can 
really expect users to read the help texts for every single option shown.
People mostly read help texts for options where they don't understand 
what this option is about - and "Serial ATA" therefore is an option that 
is likely to get enabled without the user looking at the help text.
