Hello,
currently i'm trying to measure the cpu times for
numerical algorithms written in C using two calls of
getrusage() and then calculating the time difference.
According to the man page of getrusage i looked at the
user time of my process. Surprisingly the measured user
times vary strongly depending on the system load of the
machine.
A heavy system load nearly doubles the measured time
for my routine.
Does anyone know a better way to measure the used
cpu cycles of a given process (or part of a program)
or can anyone give me a hint if i missed some important
fact.
Any help appreciated. Thank you in advance.
