Continue to cause sigsegv yes, but on the wrong page, when it will read
the page it can contain different data compared to what is on
disk/pagecache.

The advantage is a faster fast path and less special cases to keep in
mind.

It is trivial yes, but for it to work without deadlocks, it requires
non-trivial changes to the page fault handler and get_user_pages.
