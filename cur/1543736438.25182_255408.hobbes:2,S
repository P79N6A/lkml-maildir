Oh yeah, and checking our configure.in, Stratos VOS
uses 4096 for the same units. That's when I gave up
in horror (I, like you, used to think it was 512 :-).
The original smbclient test code failed to return the
correct value when connecting to HPUX because of this,
we used to multiply by 512 bytes to show the user the
complete number.
