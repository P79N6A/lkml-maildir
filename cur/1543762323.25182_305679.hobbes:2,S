Hm, I think it's proably of limited use, right?  What other code would
want this (the i2c sensor code doesn't, as it's naming scheme is
different.)
What drivers _do_ want is a way to create attributes on the fly easily,
and be able to have a "private" pointer to determine easier what file
was opened (to allow a single file handler, instead of the current
one-per-attribute type).
