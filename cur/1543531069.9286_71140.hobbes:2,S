It's too late for garbage collection at this point. I would prefer a
SIGTERM; the process can then attempt some sort of graceful exit (save
the current file, whatever), followed by a SIGKILL.
Someone suggested something similar to SIGDANGER to indicate low
memory, triggering any garbage collection routines you may have. This
would be a better approach; try SIGDANGER, see if that helped. If not,
SIGTERM. If that still hasn't freed anything, SIGKILL.
