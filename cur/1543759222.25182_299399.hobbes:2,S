There is a *direct* contradition, but it's not important.

If they were stable we'd release the darn things!  *obviously* -rc kernels
are expected to still have problems.
-rc just means "please start testing", not "deploy me on your corporate
database server".
People are smart enough to know that -rc3 will be less buggy than -rc1.
And if they're worried about bugs then why are they running -rc's at all?

What underlying problem?  The fact that -rc1 comes a bit too early?  Spare
me, that's just a nothing.  Anyone who is testing -rc kernels knows the
score.
That being said, yes, I agree that we should use 2.4-style -pre and -rc. 
But changing the names of things won't change anything.

The average user has learnt "rc1 == pre1".  I don't expect that it matters
much at all.
