Actually, it turns out this is a valid warning but not in the way
you're thinking.
In order to handle a sysrq char, you first need to see a break
condition.  You detect break conditions further down in this
function after the above check.
Hence, if tty is NULL, you don't check for any break conditions.
This means that you're never set up to handle a sysrq character,
which in turn means that the above code has no effect and can
actually be removed... which also removes the warning.

the "regs" argument may not exist in the parent context in the
!SUPPORT_SYSRQ case.
