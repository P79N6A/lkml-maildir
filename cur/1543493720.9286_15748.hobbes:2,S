I remember a couple of months ago just before 2.2.0 came out a
discussion on the performance of 2.2.x machines with less than 16 megs
of RAM versus 2.0.x on a similiar setup.  However, what I do forget is
the final verdict, it seemed to go back and forth for while.  I am
charged with installing Linux on about 20 or so 486dx33 with 8 megs of
RAM, I am debating as to which kernel to use and this information would
be very helpful.  Thanks in advance.
