You may want to report the kernel configuration about ncr/sym drivers and
possible ncr/sym driver boot options you are using. Detailing a bit what
sort of crash you got is also interesting. Thanks.

You have to deal with history until August the 11'th 1999 as you know. :)
Here is the part I am the maintainer of:
CONFIG_SCSI_NCR53C8XX 
  Configure the ncr53c8xx driver that supports all the SYM53C8XX family.
CONFIG_SCSI_SYM53C8XX 
  Configure the sym53c8xx driver that drops support for oldest chips and 
  that supports all new features of latest chips as the 896.
Both drivers can be configured.
Other CONFIG_SCSI_NCR* apply to both ncr53c8xx and sym53c8xx drivers,
since there was no reason to duplicate these entries in the kernel
configuration.

Will consider your suggestion on August the 12'th if history will
continue. :)

This one will have to wait for the 3'th millenium, I am afraid. :)

But unfortunately different and probably hard to change.
