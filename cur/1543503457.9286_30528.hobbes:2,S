Consider a mount-time option supporting a file which maps each file
name to an inode number.  You'd have to peg the entire file system
directory tree into memory on mount (and post big warnings about
the failure modes), but maybe it would be good.
Not saying that you should implement it, just critique the
idea.
Thanks,
