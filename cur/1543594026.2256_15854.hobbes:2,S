This is likely due to the updates to struct pci_driver.
The suspend callback was changed to take another parameter (the state it
is to enter) and to return an int.
The resume callback was changed to return an int.
Since these callbacks are rarely, if ever used, and since they don't
cause an actual compile error, the changes were considered benign.
