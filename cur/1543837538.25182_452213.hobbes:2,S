just to make things clear ... I thought the code isn't that bad commented. I may be wrong, of course. but could you have a look at few routines
(ext3_ext_create_new_leaf() or ext3_ext_get_blocks() fo example)
and tell me what's wrong with existing comments (besides monkey english)
and how it should look like?
thanks, Alex
