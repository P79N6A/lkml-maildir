Hmm. If you assume the CPUs in an SMP system can be in different
operating points, this would (as Pavel pointed out) result in an
explosion of operating points.
I see several possible responses to this problem:
(1) Make operating points a CPU-level abstraction, rather than a
system-level abstraction, with the set of OPs for each CPU defined
individually. This allows for non-symmetric CPUs. Each CPU would have
its own policy manager driving OP selection for that CPU (the set of
policy managers could be shared, as I believe cpufreq shares governors
among CPU).
(2) Create CPU-group operating points that captured the power
parameters for each of a set of CPUs (that is, a group OP would be a
vector of CPU OPs).
(3) Create CPU-group operating points that varied a group of CPUs
symetrically (that is, one set of CPU-level power parameters shared
across a set of CPUs), with group-level policy managers that control
transitions for the group in lockstep. 
(4) Create CPU-group operating points that varied a group of CPUs
symetrically (as in (3)), and have both group-level policy managers and
a system-level policy manager that moves CPUs from one group to
another.
