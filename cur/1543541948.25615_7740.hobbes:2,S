Yes, but on which bus ?  A PCI bus address isn't always sufficient, think about
the following setup:
CPU ----- PCI0
      |
      --- PCI1
where PCI0 translates accesses to memory bus address 0x2 0000 0000 - 0x2 ffff ffff
to PCI bus addresses 0x0000 0000 - 0xffff ffff, and PCI1 translates accesses to
0x3 0000 0000 - 0x3 ffff ffff to PCI bus addresses 0x0000 0000 - 0xffff ffff.
You can't handle everything with PCI bus addresses.  I think you'd agree code like
this (though it is rather common) is buggy:
	u32 address;
	void *mmio;
	pci_read_config_dword(pcidev, PCI_BASE_ADDRESS_0, &address);
	mmio = ioremap(address, 0x10000);
and there's no real difference between this code and assuming ioremap takes a
PCI bus address.
