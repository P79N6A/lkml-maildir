Lucky you.  Mine doesn't.  Using 3D on it makes the machine unstable,
and the performance is apalling too. So I'm looking for something
else - a radeon 7000 is cheap .  . .
And don't say that a crash during a 3D game isn't important - it is
a two-user machine and the other user is not amused when this happens.
