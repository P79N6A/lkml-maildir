Hello,
We have released version 0_2_0 of libsysfs as part of the sysfsutils
package. This version incorporates a number of changes significant
of which are:
        * Integration of the library and commands with autotools
                infrastructure.
        * Generic list handling support (Thanks to Eric J Bohm)
        * Interface to write to "writable" sysfs attributes. (Thanks
                to Guo Min)
        * Lots of support functions, such as to obtain
                - supported subsystem lists.
                - bus on which a device is present.
                - list of devices supported by a driver
You can download the package from our project site:
http://linux-diag.sourceforge.net/
All comments, suggestions and contributions are welcome.
We have a mailing list for discussing libsysfs, sysfsutils and other
diagnostics related utilities at:

Thanks,
Ananth
