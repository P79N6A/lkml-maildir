Umm, and this is different how from clearing the PSE bit when we decide 
not to use large-page support? 
See arch/x86/kernel/setup_32.c: parse_mem() for an example.
Rene - you have valid points (ie that patches were NAK'ed etc and you 
might have wanted better changelog entries), but trust me, this one is not 
one of them. /proc/cpuinfo and the kernel clearing feature bits is 
_normal_. It's how it has always been.
