there *is* a cost of having a shared VM - and this is i suspect
unavoidable.

this needs a completion event i believe.

i believe a signal-based thing would be the right (and scalable) solution
- the signal handler could free() the buffer.
this makes sense even in the VM-assisted MSG_NOCOPY case, since one wants
to do garbage collection of these in-flight buffers anyway. (not for
correctness but for performance reasons - free()-ing and immediately
reusing such a buffer would generate a COW.)
