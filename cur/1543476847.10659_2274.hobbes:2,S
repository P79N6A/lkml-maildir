Yes, the manual isn't up to date. At the website of GigaByte You can 
read that a couple 233MMX is usable, too. 
I have the same problems with two 166MHz processors ... 
OK, in the last days I built a "minimal kernel" that includes 
only the most nessesary things for running:
(1)
- no modules support
- standard vga only
- no PS/2 mouse
- no network functions
- aic7xxx only in standard configuration  
- harddisk support only (no cdrom, tape, ...)
- ext2fs only (no minix, msdos, vfat, ...)
- no sound
- no isdn
- ...
This kernel worked stable with heavy load. The next step was
activating the features for running X:
(2)
- PS/2 mouse, UNIX domain sockets, but no other network support
No problems at the first view ...
Today I'll try the next steps (if I find some time :-) ).

The box said "Requires Win95, NT, or better," and so I installed Linux.
