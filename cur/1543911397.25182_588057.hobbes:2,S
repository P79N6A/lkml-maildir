If it was doing something more complicated in the critical section other
than summing stuff up, I would probably recommend going for another map
instead of using the current hotplug synchronization. But for this case
the current hotplug synchronization would work just fine.
I can very well understand your paranoia, but let me assure you, you are
not the only one ;-)
