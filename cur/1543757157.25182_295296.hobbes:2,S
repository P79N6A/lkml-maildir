I have no problem for USB "stateless" devices. The real problem is when you
do a suspend/resume cycle with a *mounted* usb stick or disk. Upon resume,
the device is found and associated with a diffent block device than before,
and the previous mount point is stuck forever (well, almost forever).
Sometime umount -f works, sometime no, but it is quite irritating that I
need to reboot to have the "good old /dev/sda1" which is in the fstab
working.
