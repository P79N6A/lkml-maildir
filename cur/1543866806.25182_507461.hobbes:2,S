The compat_sys_epoll_pwait function has two sources of compat. One is the 
sigset_t and the other one is the struct epoll_event. The sigset_t compat 
is always needed, while the struct epoll_event may be needed. The code of 
(upcoming) compat_sys_epoll_pwait takes care of both, with a smart 
compile-time check to wire sys_epoll_wait or compat_sys_epoll_wait, 
depending on the need of the struct epoll_event compat handling.
So yes, compat_sys_epoll_pwait is needed.
