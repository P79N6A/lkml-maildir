X86 has no nice way to address over 4Gb of RAM. You can do paging games with
multiple banks and shmat (ie like using DOS expanded ram but with bigger
pieces).

If your algorithm can work well with say 2Gb windows on the data and only change
window evey so often (in computing terms) then it should be ok, if its access
is random you need to look at a 64bit box like an Alpha, Sparc64 or eventually
IA64
