OK - you dont like the idea of having a wrapper to grab the lock and use that ?

I agree. The chance of getting this wrong in the future is smaller if we use the
the "do_brk requires mmap_sem" rule.

OK - I think v2.4 being consistent wrt function names and calling convetion in 
this area is important. 
If you don't like the wrapper I'll change all callers do grab the lock accordingly.
And have this warning as you suggested (which makes a hell lot more sense):
