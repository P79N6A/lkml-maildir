AFAIK they quietly removed priority paging from Solaris 8,
somewhat embarrasing considering the publicity at its
introduction with Solaris 7, but no more embarrasing than
the regular VM rewrites Linux undergoes ;/
Now only if VM was a well-understood area and we could just
implement something known to work ... OTOH, that would take
away all the fun ;)
cheers,
