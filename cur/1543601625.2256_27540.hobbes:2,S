Subject: [PATCH] for drivers/char/sysrq.c
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

  Hi, Linus. The appended patch fixes drivers/char/sysrq.c so that it
doesn't do a bugus redefine of wakeup_bdflush(), nor attempt to pass
arguments to it. The changes in 2.4.10-pre12 broke sysrq.c compiling.
<whinge>
How did something this basic get submitted in the first place?!?
Doesn't anyone bother compiling patches before sending to Linus?
This is the second time today I've had to patch the kernel just to get
the rotten thing to compile. I'm not happy that whoever put in those
__builtin_expect()'s didn't bother testing with THE RECOMMENDED
COMPILER!!! It's not the first time that sort of thing has happened.
</whinge>
				Regards,
					Richard....
