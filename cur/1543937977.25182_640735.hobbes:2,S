I'm just looking at some of the other printks in do+page_fault right
now in the oops code.
What do you prefer:
	"Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference"
or
	"BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference"
Other than that, I think for the most part, the shorter X86_64 strings
are better.
This does change user-visible output however, but would be nice to have
a similar format.
