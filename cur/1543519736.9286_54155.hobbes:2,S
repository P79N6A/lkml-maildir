What about just reading the relevant 50 lines of kernel
code and draw conclusions _after_ that? :)
Linux _does_ schedule threads exactly the same as
it schedules normal processes. Threads get scheduled
on all CPUs, except when the amount of work done
(avrage slice) is less than the time it takes to flush
the whole CPU cache.
kernel/sched.c is the place to look...
