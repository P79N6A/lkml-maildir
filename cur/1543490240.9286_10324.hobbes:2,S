Well, no, the ppp stuff needs it, and there's an ever-increasing number of
other places which need to decompress (ramdisks, for example, though that is
init).
At last count there were at least 4-5 separate copies of the gzip decompressor
in the kernel.  I've got a patch to make a gzip (de)compression a general
library function and exporting it via the modules interface, and to change the
various users of it to just call the library.  I was saving it up for 2.3, but
I guess there's some immediate use for it.
