FYI, vmware modules broke during your change because 2.4.20-xx kernels from 
RedHat moved page_count() from linux/mm.h to linux/mm_inline.h, and made 
it unavailable for non-GPL modules. So we had to do
#ifndef page_count
#define page_count(p) (p)->count
#endif
and this #ifndef test was broken by making page_count inline function.
But I'd like to publicly thank you for your effort, I really appreciate
it.
