Hi Bob,
thanks for Your reply. Fine to hear that Your configuration works.

Don't know. I cannot check this.

All this except cp works fine. When trying to cp the overview.pcd I get an
I/O error after a big part of it was already copied. The same is true 
for some (!) image files (*.pcd). Older CDROMs work
fine ! Only newer ones cause trouble ! So, it's not xpcd causing the
trouble it must be some kernel routine ....
Kindest regards
Michael
