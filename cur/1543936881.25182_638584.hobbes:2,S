They won't fsck in planned downtimes.  They will have to use fsck when
the shit hits the fan and they need to.   Not sure about ext3, but big
XFS user with a close tie to the US goverment were concerned about this
case for really big filesystems and have sponsored speedup including
multithreading xfs_repair.  I'm pretty sure the same arguments apply
to ext3, even if the filesystems are a few magnitudes smaller.
