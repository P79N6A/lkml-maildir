Consider linux-iscsi-5.x CVS branch as a "mainline". Current open-iscsi
SVN repository is the place where all hard-core development will happen
at least for the nearest future.
I really hope sf.net will provide SVN hosting very soon. than we will
see how it goes. and may be we might just migrate current berlios.de
hosting to the sf.net.
