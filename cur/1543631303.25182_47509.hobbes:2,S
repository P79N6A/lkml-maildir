RedHat has fixed the problem in its kernels. There are fixes out there, but
Linus is not applying them. I would venture that this is because they would
fix the problems *for the moment* and take away interest in revamping VM for
real.
It might help if Linus would actually state his intentions. So far the
problem has been that the AA vm was badly documented and a big chunk of
patches. Andrew Morton split them up nicely and documented each patch, so
that is resolved.
