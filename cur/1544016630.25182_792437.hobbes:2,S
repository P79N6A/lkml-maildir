Direct IO doesn't lock the pages either.
There has simply never been any synchronisation here (by design: see
MADV_DONTFORK/MADV_DOFORK/VM_DONTCOPY etc).
This is one thing which Andrea had been trying to improve. If it can
be done without introducing nasty overheads, then yes it would be
nice to improve COW vs DIO semantics.
