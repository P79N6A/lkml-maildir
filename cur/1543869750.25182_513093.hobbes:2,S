    Hi all :)
    From time to time, the tdfxfb driver from 2.6.19.5 (sorry, I cannot
test in 2.6.20.x because it doesn't compile, the infamous BDF negative
offset problem) garbles the display, leaving only a lot of thin lines,
just like sync was lost. The display can be repaired by switching to
another console, but this is annoying. This happens with a Voodoo 3
3000, using 800x600x8@100 mode.
    Anyone has this problem? Can it be solved changing anything?
