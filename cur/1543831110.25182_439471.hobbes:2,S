Looks like it does run:
$ pfmon -ecpu_clk_unhalted,interrupts_masked_cycles -k --system-wide -t 10
<session to end in 10 seconds>
CPU0     60351837 CPU_CLK_UNHALTED
CPU0    346548229 INTERRUPTS_MASKED_CYCLES
The CPU spent ~60 million clocks unhalted and ~350 million with interrupts
disabled.  (This is an idle 1.6GHz Turion64 machine.)
Now let's see what happens when we exclude the idle thread:
$ pfmon -ecpu_clk_unhalted,interrupts_masked_cycles -k --system-wide -t 10 --excl-idle
<session to end in 10 seconds>
CPU0    449250 CPU_CLK_UNHALTED
CPU0    161577 INTERRUPTS_MASKED_CYCLES
Looks like excluding the idle thread means interrupts that happen while idle
don't get counted either.  We took 5000 clock interrupts and I know they take
longer than that to process.
