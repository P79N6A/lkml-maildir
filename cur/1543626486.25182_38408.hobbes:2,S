: Heh, you mean "here is the hardware information, please make a patch".
: But your choice of red makes it truly a "bleeding edge" kernel :)
: The fact that we have been using linux for ~ 10 yrs and nobody has
: complained about the lack of this function yet says something...
: Anyway, have a look at this and see if it is what you had in mind.
: I figured it would be sensible to have a per VC colour
Yes, bleeding edge it was.
Adding something like this is allowed only on April 1st.
[But other systems have it. I find that both FreeBSD and UnixWare
have a KDSBORDER ioctl.]
Yes, your patch sounds more or less OK, but more less than more,
since I think that this should be treated completely parallel
to the palette stuff. And that works as follows:
There are ioctls and escape sequences. Escape sequences set
the palette per-VC. Upon reset the palette is reset to a default.
The default is set by ioctl. (And at the moment the ioctl sets
the default, it is also applied to the actual screen.)
[Not that I like this construction so much, but for uniformity..]
[In fact the author of the palette patch did not know the standard
for escape sequences, but nobody stopped him.]
