Well, 'unknown' restores the previous behavior (before simulation codes
were added to the driver) so it is pretty safe, however 'ignore' is indeed
more correct I think.
I will send an updated patch. Linus, if you already applied the original
one just ignore the new one - we can change it post 2.6.15 when we add
more simulation codes to HID driver.
