Just wanted to close the issue by saying it came out that it actually is NOT an IRQ problem.
Another close look at "hdparm -I" vs. "harparm -v" (and syslog) revealed that the hard disks had been configured for UDMA mode 5 by the controller (probably at boot time) while the Linux kernel set them to some IO mode.
Having found this out, I really wonder how the disks managed to work under any circumstances at all.
thanks for your hints and reading,
