My main concern is whether we (different attempts) can share the code.
IOW whether we can reach and form the agreement for single security framework.
It is possible to write code if only we have a clear specifications, but
this is not the case.
I can easily think of LSM, or whatever we call,  as Greatest Common Factor,
but in that case LSM will explode soon and no single module can not be happy,
Linux security will not be achieved.

We should not invent wheels, that is agreed by everyone , but if we try to share
something that we can not share, we will fail. From the fact existing
LSM did not satisfy any module (including SELinux), I do not
want to investigate stack able version.
