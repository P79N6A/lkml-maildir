What filesystem you're using?
For XFS I'd expect this:
STATIC ssize_t
linvfs_sendfile(
        struct file             *filp,
        loff_t                  *ppos,
        size_t                  count,
        read_actor_t            actor,
        void                    *target)
{
        vnode_t                 *vp = LINVFS_GET_VP(filp->f_dentry->d_inode);
        int                     error;
        VOP_SENDFILE(vp, filp, ppos, 0, count, actor, target, NULL, error);
        return error;
}
(note error is int, not ssize_t), but I don't see anything obvious
for other filesystems.
