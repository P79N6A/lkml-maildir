Hi people,
With the recent version 2.6.6 my ide disks are shutdown on reboot, this not happens with 2.6.5.
I try booting with acpi=off and it behaves equal, disk shutdown on reboot.
This like is waited for from now on? :(
The disks only will be shutdown on halt no in reboot :)
I suspect that the problem are in changeset 1.1587.31.6
Please CC to me, i am not subscribed to lkml.
Take care,
 djgera
