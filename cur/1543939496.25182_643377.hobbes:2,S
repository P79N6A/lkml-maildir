Here is the terminal printout from the correct bootup on a previous build.
<6>Freeing init memory: 584K
Freeing init memory: 584K
init started:  BusyBox v0.60.5 (2006.06.15-11:12+0000) multi-call binary
Bummer, could not run '/etc/init.d/rcS': No such file or directory
ÿ
Please press Enter to activate this console.
It looks that it's printing out several ÿ first and then replaced them
with "init started: BusyBox..." seems quite obscure, as the only
difference between those two FPGA builds is they were built at
different runs using exactly the same source files.
