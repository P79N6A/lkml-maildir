Unfortunately, it is not possible to implement ieee80211 as a library,
because you need fragmentation, WDS and such funny stuff, which require
ieee80211 (or possibly "softmac") to be a layer between networking core
and a driver.

Making ieee80211 (not any possible layer on top of it, but ieee80211) to
handle part of WE for drivers and reexport (or whatever) the rest to
drivers will not take off the possibility to use WE by others. Where is
the problem?
The goal is to make life simpler for drivers. Dealing with WE is not
easy and even if everything which ieee80211 will do is allowing drivers
to register their handlers during allocation of ieee80211_device by
simply setting pointers to their functions (in ieee80211_device or
somewhere), it will be easier (see the thread at
http://oss.sgi.com/projects/netdev/archive/2004-06/msg00463.html
 to
understand what I mean).
But I agree this is something we can argue about. This is not the main
reason I gave in my mail, so if you still don't agree with me in this
point, please imagine I didn't mention it - it's not something I want to
argue about now and the explanation I gave is I think valid even without
this point.
Thanks,
