Debian bug, as this version of udev, and kernel, running on a different
distro, works just fine for me here :)

The input subsystem moved to handle nested class devices, so udev had to
change to handle this properly.  I bet however Debian does the initial
population of the /dev tree is messed up somehow, as that is what it
looks like is happening (event3 I bet is from a USB device that is added
after init starts?)
