Certain VIA chipsets had some nasty bugs that caused corruption. The older
kernels have a workaround that mostly does the job but has a few side
effects. The 2.4.8 kernel has the official VIA provided workaround, which
makes sbpci128 cards work again, and sorts out some bus hangs, especially
with matrox cards
