I just checked the 2.6.11-mm1 release and this is only half-fixed there, 
and it is the worst of both halves: the kmalloc only mallocs the size of 
a pointer, but the memset is fixed, so it memset's the size of a 
structure (oops). This is partially my fault for not sending the patch 
in the first place, together with the bug report.
The attached patch against 2.6.11-mm1 should fix the kmalloc.
By the way, I haven't got any response from an alsa developer about the 
bug in sound/core/control.c, but this is already fixed in 2.6.11-mm1, 
along with several other changes to that file. So the status is: it was 
a bug, but it is already fixed :)
