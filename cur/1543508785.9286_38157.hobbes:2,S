Pretty much i see this as an issue of frame of mind: bus groupings vs.
functional groupings.
If you're thinking of the machine's "concept" of the devices (NIC on PCI
at 0x3000, irq 8; sound card on ISA at 0x330, dma 1...), bus grouping
makes more sense. It is how the machine is laid out, and therefore is a
good way organize things. Bus grouping is how a computer thinks of the
devices.
However, if you're thinking of the person's concept of the devices, it
breaks down more easily into functional groupings. And all(most?) of the
kernel developers are people. The config scripts are broken down by
functional groups--it's a way that is easier to navigate. Functional
grouping is how a person thinks of the devices.
If we went with a bus-sorted hierarchy, for consistency's sake we have to
break down the block/char/etc drivers into scsi, ide, esdi, floppy, and so
on. and who wants to put maintainers through that much work? =)
Finally, This Is the Way It's Always Been Done.
i still have an open mind.
i'm also hoping this hasn't been discussed heavily in the past =)
