I don't quite understand where you want to go with this question. What do 
you consider an easy to find option? We have thousands of config options, 
they have to be organized somehow, so they are always hidden somewhere.
Currently the debug menu is more a random collection of options, with a 
little organization it actually can make things easier to find, while 
still allowing a simple menu for the occasional user and an advanced menu.

With my suggestion I was more concentrating on the latter (the general 
organisation of the menu options) than the actual wording.
