No, it is not, I already broke AppArmor once, and it took me less then
one hour.
Give me machine with root shell, and make app armor permit everything
but reading /etc/secret.file. AppArmor is not designed for this, but
if you want to claim your solution works, this looks like a nice test.
Actually, give password to everyone, and see who breaks it first.
