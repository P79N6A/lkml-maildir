Linus, please pull the latest scheduler git tree from:
   git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/mingo/linux-2.6-sched.git
it includes 11 commits: 3 (low-key) fixlets, 6 low-impact cleanups, the 
marking of CONFIG_FAIR_GROUP_SCHED as !EXPERIMENTAL and a debug-printout 
improvement.
The "reduce balance-tasks overhead" commit is admittedly borderline for 
a post-rc1 pull because it is primarily a speedup and only secondarily a 
cleanup - but it's been in my queue for some time with no problems and a 
followup cleanup depended on it too so i included it.
build and boot tested on x86 32-bit and 64-bit.
	Ingo
