Spaces are used to indent all over the kernel; using a few spaces to pad
out some indentation into the proper place is accepted practice,
regardless of what CodingStyle says.  The most important rule probably
needs to be explicitly added:
    Break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous.[1]
Though the first para of CodingStyle is very clear that it is a set of
guidelines rather than strict rules.
