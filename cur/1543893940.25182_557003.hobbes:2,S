Nope. I'm just tired of giving proof after proof that you're wrong and having 
you restate the same tripe.

Certainly. I never said otherwise. What I stated and then *implied* was that 
you are repeating the same false logic over and over again trying to make 
people believe that it isn't borked and that that false logic is exactly the 
same crap I've seen from the FSF numerous times.

Where I am examining the facts and drawing a logical conclusion. That it 
happens to form an opinion is secondary to the truth.

Okay. Still doesn't explain why you have argued that the GPLv3 doesn't attempt 
to cover hardware and then provide proof that it does.

This is no surprise - I had a feeling this was the truth. Not that it changes 
my opinion at all. As I've said, I have never liked the GPL at all, but v2 is 
the best that exists - even though I've put together custom licenses myself, 
none of them have had the number of lawyers look at them that the GPLv2 has 
had.
