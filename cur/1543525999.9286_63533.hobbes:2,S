Ok, now I see what you are looking for. you are wanting a interface card to
turn the linux box into a DSL router.
such a card may be available (I don't know) but I would be very surprised if
a card intended for use on a windows box did that job. if it did the windows
box would have to be the DSL router, and I don't know very many people (MS
fanatics included) that would try to do that.

Really? I expected that the DSL card would just implement the physical
layer, and that IP routing would be left to the PC, just like
conventional modems.
So the DSL card yields IP packets, not some lower-level packet?
Are all DSL cards like this?
