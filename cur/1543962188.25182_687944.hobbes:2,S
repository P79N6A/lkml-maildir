Pardon this comment from an inexperienced kernel hacker, but it seems to
me that one of the main problems is subsystems stomping on each other
during the merge window, and a general confusion as to who is responsible
for what bugs that appear.
Perhaps a shorter merge window, using a round-robin approach, based on
subsystem, would help alleviate these issues?
This would:
	- give people a "known" tree to base their subsystem patches on,
		when their turn comes around
	- give a rough schedule if the round-robin was always consistent
		in order, or made known in advance
	- a shorter window would keep people from waiting too long for
		their turn
	- give those responsible for the currently merged subsystem
		motivation and clarity to fix bugs that do appear during
		their merge window
Problems I see with this approach:
	- those at the end of the cycle get the shaft, if previous changes
		affect their work
	- political issues with determining the order of the round-robin
		schedule
If I'm overlooking something, I'm sure someone will correct me. :-)
