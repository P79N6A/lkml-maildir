Well, only suspend is doing something significant, but driver might
take arbitrary time to do its DMA... Like
Freeing some memory... [write starts]
Suspending devices... [but you did not suspend disk!]
Atomic copy... [oops, that disk was *still* doing DMA]

Well, I believe we really need to suspend *all* devices. We just do
not need to spin the disks down and make screens blank; we still need
drivers to be stopped so that no activity happens during atomic copy.
