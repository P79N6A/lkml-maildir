... I can't boot anymore -- I get the above error, among others.  I get
the feeling that the kernel's reading some configuration files, because it
knows what files it's looking for, getting other errors like "INIT: cannot
execute blah" ... 
I've tried booting with a friend's 2.2.2 kernel and it gives the same 
error.  I suspect the problem is that I recently resized my linux 
partition with partition magic, and perhaps PQMagic changed my block 
size?  How do I change this back?  I can't boot anymore -- so your help 
is greatly appreciated.  I'm also not on this list so please CC your 
responses to me.
