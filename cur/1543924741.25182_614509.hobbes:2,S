I am seeing something very similar on a PowerPC machine where copying a
file from an LVM volume with ext3 on it to a simple scsi partition (again
ext3) on the same disk will hang in congestion_wait.  If I am patient
enough, the copy makes very slow progress.  A kill -9 will kill it
eventually, but a simple control-C will not.
This hang occurs more often than not (and usually when I am trying to
install a new kernel into /boot for testing :-)).
I don't have access to the machine today, but if more information would
be useful, I could boot into 2.6.24-rc1-<mumble> again tomorrow.
