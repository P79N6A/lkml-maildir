Subject: Oops when rebooting

Just compiled 2.5.41, everything seems to work fine except it oopses 
reliably when rebooting. It's a tyan tiger mpx with a single cpu. Kernel 
was configured for smp, preemptible, and acpi. I can send my .config if 
it'll help
Oops is in driverfs_remove_file + 0x46/0x60
Process reboot
Call trace:
device_remove_file
driverfs_remove_partitions
del_gendisk
idedisk_cleanup
ide_notify_reboot
notifier_call_chain
sys_reboot
__get_page_state
sync_inodes_sb
backround_writeout
sync_inodes
syscall_call
I can get the rest of the oops if needed, didn't particularly want to 
copy all of it down
Please CC, as i'm not on the list.
