A comment in eventpoll.c says:
 * This semaphore is acquired by ep_free() during the epoll file
 * cleanup path and it is also acquired by eventpoll_release()
 * if a file has been pushed inside an epoll set and it is then
 * close()d without a previous call toepoll_ctl(EPOLL_CTL_DEL).
I.e. implying that the final close() is possible while it's registered.
(Btw, a function called eventpoll_release() doesn't exist).
What happens when a file descriptor is closed while it is inside the set?
I guess it's simply dropped from the set, is that right?
