Nope, it's the ohci controller in the iBook g4 (Nec, I believe).

ok, I reproduced it. I've put in place a crontab that checks if my
router is pingable, and if not, dumps async and registers, resets the
zd1201 (the iwconfig command is the one that puts it back into a
functioning state), and dumps async and registers.
Here's the result:
before resetting (when nothing gets through):

The registers file changes while everything works, too. For example
"BLF" isn't always present on the cmdstatus line.
Also, I saw these lines in dmesg. Sadly enough they don't appear in
syslog so I can't tell whether it happened at the same time the network
went down.
