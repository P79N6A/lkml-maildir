No.

It just takes degraded mode, an unexpected power cycle, and concurrent
write activity.  
Degraded mode relies on the parity disk being in sync at all times ---
you can't recover data from the missing spindle unless that is true.
However, writes to a stripe are not atomic, and you can get a reboot
when, say, a write to one of the surviving data chunks has succeeded,
but the corresponding write to the parity disk has not.  If this
happens, the parity is no longer in sync, and the data belonging to
the missing spindle in that stripe will be lost forever.

If it was a clean shutdown and reboot, you're fine.
