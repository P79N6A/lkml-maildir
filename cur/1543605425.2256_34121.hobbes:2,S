 - Al Viro: fix partition handling sanity check.
Can you reproduce it with >= 2.4.13-pre1 ?
We've got the same kind of lilo.conf (no md=... option) and it works
here for vanilla to 2.4.10 and -ac to 2.4.12-ac3 (no vanilla 2.4.12 tested
in a raid setup, surprise !). I would test 2.4.13-prex before modifying 
lilo.conf.
