Yes I can unload ehci-hcd, but I have one USB 2.0 device that strangely 
enough DOES work as such, and unloading ehci-hcd will cause that also to 
run at 1.1 speed.
Clearly something is failing when plugging a device with ehci-hcd 
loaded, the driver seems to keep retrying indefinitely. Instead it would 
be nice if after a few tries it hands the device over to uhci-hcd. This 
seems to be the behaviour under Windows, so I was wondering if Linux 
could be made to do something similar.
