Subject: AMD X2 unsynced TSC fix?

Someone recently pointed out to me that a Windows "CPU driver update"
supplied by AMD fixes the unsynced TSC problem on dual core AMD64
systems.

"The AMD Dual-Core Optimizer can help improve some PC gaming video
performance by compensating for those applications that bypass the
Windows API for timing by directly using the RDTSC (Read Time Stamp
Counter) instruction. Applications that rely on RDTSC do not benefit
from the logic in the operating system to properly account for the
affect of power management mechanisms on the rate at which a processor
core's Time Stamp Counter (TSC) is incremented. The AMD Dual-Core
Optimizer helps to correct the resulting video performance effects or
other incorrect timing effects that these applications may experience on
dual-core processor systems, by periodically adjusting the core
time-stamp-counters, so that they are synchronized."
What are the chances of Linux getting a similar fix?
