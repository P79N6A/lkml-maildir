I've made required_fds a struct list_head list to accommodate for  
multiple fd:s (not sure that's absolutely needed though), so a couple  
of pointers need to be updated in sys_read/write. However, if that's  
too slow, and we only care about bookkeeping a single fd which is the  
case with sys_read/write, that can be changed into a single fd  
integer assignment.
Would that be fast enough?
