Heh.  I'm surprised you haven't got more adverse reactions.

Whilst that's true, if you have to deal with a run of contiguous page structs
(eg: the page allocator, perhaps) it's actually less efficient because it
takes more cache to do it.  But, hey, it's a compromise whatever.
In the scheme of things, if we're mostly dealing with individual page structs
(as I think we are), then yes, I think it's probably a good thing to do -
especially with larger page sizes.

That's a good idea, one that's implemented on some platforms anyway.  It'll be
especially good with NUMA, I suspect.

kmap, filling in scatter/gather lists, crypto stuff.  I like it.
Can you do this just by turning on WANT_PAGE_VIRTUAL on all 64-bit platforms?
