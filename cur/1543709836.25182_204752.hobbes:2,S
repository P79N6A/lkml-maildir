Hello and thank you for your answer. I determined that this cpu has a fsb of
66MHz. The reason for my question was that i want to underclock the cpu.
I think it would be better to change the multiplier instead of changing the fsb.
Therefore i read the msr register 0x02ah, tilted bit 27 and wrote it back, but
the cpu clock is still the same. Why does that not work? Is it possible to
change the multiplier at runtime at all?
