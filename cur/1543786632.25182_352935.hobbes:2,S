I agree, given that it is for a much smaller number of refcounted
objects.

The GFP_ATOMIC support stuff is needed only for dst entries. However
using per-cpu refcounters in such objects like dentries and dst entries
are problematic and that is why I hadn't tried changing those.
Some of the earlier versions of the allocator were simpler and I think
we need to roll this back and do some more analysis. No GFP_ATOMIC
support, no early use. I haven't got around to look at this 
for a while, but I will try.
Thanks
