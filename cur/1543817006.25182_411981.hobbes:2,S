 I agree with the latter option. I can write a patch for the kernel
 to issue the warning.

 with the new subsystem that has recently been introduced you can
 have more than one clock. the first one is /dev/rtc0 . udev
 will make a link from /dev/rtc to /dev/rtc0, but it would be
 fine if hwclock can check /dev/rtc0 itself in no device is specified
 on the cmd line.
 One can have a mix of I2C clocks, x86 and maybe external radio
 syncronized clocks all in the same subsystem.
 
 But there's a problem. hwclock waits for the second
 to change before setting the time. It may happen, with some i2c clocks,
 that the oscillator is disabled and that it is started when the
 time is set. Some other devices simply hang and may be restarted only by setting
 the time.
 It would be fine if hwclock can wait for the second to change only
 for a definite amount of time and then always try to set the time.
 It may also happen that reading the time from the device returns
 a failure due to a stopped clock. hwclock should ignore the error.
