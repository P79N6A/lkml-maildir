some new interesting results with 2.5.42:
http://spunk.dnsalias.org/latencytest/2.5.42/2x256.html
overall much worse, *but* greatly reduced latency peaks (max. 6 ms) as
compared to 2.5.41:
http://spunk.dnsalias.org/latencytest/2.5.41/2x256.html
here the peaks easily reach 13 ms.
i'm not really sure what to make of this....
can someone explain ?
andrew, it seems part of your mm patch was merged - is there an updated
patch around that will add the missing hunks ?
best,
jörn
