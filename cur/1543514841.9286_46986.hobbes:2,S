Subject: re-sent some lost message
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

I re-posted all the messages that I sent the last days to the list. I
don't know why, but in the last days all my messages never reached the
mailing list and I never get one bounce back from vger. Now luckily all
seems ok again as I just seen my three last messages reaching the list ;).
