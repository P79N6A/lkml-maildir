Thanks!
Just one thing...
I need redundancy, so I can't go with RAID 0. I thought I'd go with RAID
4, to avoid reading the parity info (and thereby wasting time), and still
have some quite good redundancy.
Q: Should I use hardware RAID or software RAID here? I can see they've
been using a rather large stripe (or chunk) size on the RAID (2MB). The
RAID controller I planned to use only supports up to 512kB stripes. As I
said, the files I'm reading are rather large - up to 10GB each, or at
least 1GB. I'm reading 4-7Mbps (500-900kB) per connection and each
connection reads only one file. Will a large stripe size help me here?
