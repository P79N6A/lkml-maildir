Me too.
I'm getting ...non-running (1) task from c3fff8c0 and c3fff920 in strict
alternation, every few seconds.  During boot-up there was also one with
status 4 from 8c0 and one with status 1 from 860 (all
c3fff---).  Symbols in "cat proc/ksyms | sort" go up to c02796c8
(pci-root) and then the next symbol is an __insmod at c4806000.  The
machine in question has 64Mb of ram.
