The Debian 'popularity-contest' package has an interesting use for
atime.  It runs weekly (if you install it, of course -- nobody *has* to
do this!) and determines when each of your installed packages was last
referenced -- then mails this anonymously to a drop box somewhere.  The
Higher Purpose here is to determine what the "most useful" Debian
packages are.  These go on the first volume of the Debian CD set, to
make a one-volume Debian CD as useful as possible.
The Windows 2000 install subsystem seems to collect similar data.
Heaven only knows whether *that* data ever makes it back to its
owners....
