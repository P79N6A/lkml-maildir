Especially the last makes me curious: does MIS mean "missed"? And:
might this be related to esd running here having some trouble to keep
playing without short little "breaks"? The count on MIS is actually
growing steadily, the uptime is currently only 37 hours.
The box is used most time with two niced seti-processes. Other than
that, cpu stat is hardly at 10%.
