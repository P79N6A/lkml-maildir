From the hardware POV:
* there is generic way to save/restores IDE device's configuration
* there is no generic way to save/restore IDE controller's configuration
From the software POV what we only do currently is setting controller
and drive for a correct transfer mode by using host driver specific callback
(in case of using 'ide-generic' there is no such callback).

Probably do_rw_taskfile() is the method you want to use, you also need
to place invoking of ACPI provided ATA commands in the right place in
the IDE PM state machine [ ide_{start,complete}_power_step() ].
PS1 Please don't use taskfile_lib_get_identify(), drive->id
should contain valid ID - if it doesn't it is a BUG.
PS2 Have you seen libata ACPI patches by Randy?
Maybe some of the code dealing with ACPI can be put to
<linux/ata.h> and be shared between IDE and libata drivers?
Thanks,
Bartlomiej
