That can be tricky if the other end of /dev/ttyS0 is plugged into a debugging
serial port on an embedded system where you don't have easy access to a shell.
Or for that matter, if you're trying to talk to the serial port on a non-embedded
system, which is too far into OOM thrashing for you to be able to get a
usable shell prompt.....
