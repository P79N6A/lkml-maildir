Hi,
  I just uploaded definitive (I hope) version of vmnet for softnet
at 
ftp://platan.vc.cvut.cz/pub/vmware/vmware-444-for-2.3.44.tar.gz.
  If someone needs vmnet version for some older build than 444
(beta 2.0), contact me at address below.
  I'm sorry that I bothering linux-kernel list with this, but I
saw some requests here (and some strange replies - all affected
vmnet code is of course GPLed).
					Best regards,
