All good stuff. Plus a little observation...
Anybody else notice that US colleges and universities are producing less and
less original research?
It used to be that any research done by a school became public information. 
This includes any research paid for by either private companies OR government
funding.
somewhere along the way (around 1970-80) this changed.
Now the research becomes propriatary to the funding agency, and the government
research quietly gets passed to a contracting company, and becomes 
propriatary.
The people that DID the research disappear into companies, and no longer 
contribute anything (other than to the company).
Research that was paid for by the public (via the government funding) and the
facilities used by the researchers (partially paid for by companies) has 
vanished.
New research can't be done...
Quite frequently, original software is doen the same way. My first exposure 
to that was the RSA security algorithm (My instructor was one of the 
publication evaluators for the paper). Since the algorithm was propriatary, 
nothing could be done with it. Hell, we thought about implementing it just to
see what we could do with it, but were discouraged by the fact that we would 
not be able to release anything. So, no software, no innovation, no usage 
until it was implemented in a country that didn't support that restriction.
Then the algorithm + software went everywhere... with BIG warnings about not
using it in the US.
Current research (and software innovation) is moving out of the US because it
is just not worth doing it here. The public pays for it, and gets amost 
nothing back - except more charges for attempting to use it.
One thing I like about the GPL is that it prevents the stealing from the 
public...
