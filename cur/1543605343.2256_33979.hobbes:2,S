Thanks, applied.
Any idea where the MAC address comes from on the Symbios card?
Standard net driver policy is to read the MAC address from the original
source at probe time, typically EEPROM but sometimes in a boot PROM,
firmware console memory, or cardbus CIS.  It is generally preferred to
-not- read the MAC address from the card registers unless you absolutely
have to, since card's copy of the MAC address is easily changeable or
corrupted by rebooting from Windows into Linux or similar things (MacOS
into Linux).
