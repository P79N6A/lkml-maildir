Well I won't say it won't happen with my patch, but nice is a lot
nicer. Give it a try.
No, it wouldn't be wise to renice X to -10 if it caused it to
starve xmms. I don't think that will happen in my version, so I
think it is reasonable to renice X if you know it will have to
do more work than other tasks and yet should still be scheduled
quickly for good interactivity...
