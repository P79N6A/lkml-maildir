I had the same problem with Seagate ST313021A (13 gig) drives on
BP6/HPT366/UDMA66.  Initial throughput reported by `hdparm -t' was 22
megs/sec which would slowly wilt to 5 megs/sec.
I discovered that sending _any_ reconfiguration command to the drive -
even one which was not supported by that particular drive - would bring
the performance back.
So when it goes slow, try running, say, `hdparm -A1' and see what
happens.
Andre and I scratched each others heads for a while, suspected a
firmware bug.  He sent an email to a contact at Seagate.  This was in
April, so I guess that person is a very slow typist.
