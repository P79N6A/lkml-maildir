	Ho-hum... /tmp without sticky bit is an interesting animal, not to
mention the nice stuff in /var (sparse files), /usr/bin (suid/sgid not to
root), ditto for long names, ditto for cases-sensitivity, etc.

What version are you talking about? 2.0? IIRC it still has data-corrupting
races. 2.2? Thanks, but I'm not really sure that it's rock-solid. 2.3?
Geez, guess what I'm doing right now? Yup, testing the (supposedly) fixed
version of msdosfs (sheesh... and I wasn't even drunk when I made that
typo).
	BTW, _what_ are those purposes? I'm really curious.
