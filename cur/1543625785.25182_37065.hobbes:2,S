It's not a question of which kernel glibc is compiled under, it's a question
of which version of the kernel headers (/usr/include/{linux,asm}) glibc is
compiled against.
A glibc, even the newest glibc, *compiled against 2.2 headers* cannot know
about the new getrlimit, so the run-time test cannot be compiled and is not
used. Such a glibc subsequently breaks fsck if run under a 2.4 kernel.
Recompile your glibc against 2.4 headers and you should get a glibc and fsck
that work if run under either a 2.2 or 2.4 kernel.
The necessary kernel patch to fix this mess is in the latest -pre-ac (thanks
Alan).
