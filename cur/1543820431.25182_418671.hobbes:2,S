Yes, that is accurate. I can write in some documentation.

Most of them, yes. Without them, the arch-specific could would need to be 
able to iterate through the list of active regions which would lead to 
more similar-looking code.

Used by x86_64 when it finds the SRAT table is bad and needs to rediscover 
active regions in another way. Spontaneous reboots were possible without 
it.

Currently only used by power when initialising the boot allocator. There 
were no obvious canditates for use elsewhere.

This does not need to be in a header.

Could be dropped, only required by x86_64.

Removed two copies of similar functions from power and x86. I thought I 
could replace the IA64 one as well, but the code was unusual enough there 
that I decided not to.

Removes similar-looking code from power and x86_64.

This is only used by power.

Removes similar looking code from x86_64. For all other architectures, it 
does the job of the existing functions that calculate zholes_size[].
