If you're really interested, I have a Pace V23 modem that can be
configured to provide the "RINGING" response. However, it's strictly
V23 only, which is the split-speed standard from around 1981, and
provides 1200 Baud receive, 75 Baud transmit only in this case.
I regard this as a museum piece myself...
I've also just been told that SOME of the ISDN adapters around caan
provide the RINGING response, but I have no experience with them, so
can neither confirm nor deny that...
Best wishes from Riley.
