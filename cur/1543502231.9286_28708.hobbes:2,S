	hi,
	i don't have any respond about the subject. as i needed
	raid0 in the near future i hand patched 2.2.10 just to
	make raid0 works, and it is.
	2 12MB/s ide disks become a 18MB/s device satisfies me
	(not with bonnie, just with good old hdparm).
	if anybody interested just drop me a line, it's rather
	big (39k bzip2'ed) so i don't post it on the list.
	imel
