Subject: Typo in bttv-driver.c in versions 2.4.21 to 2.4.23

Hello !
I just encountered that there is an equal sign missing in bttv-driver.c 
on line 564. - Which gives a parse error when one tries to compile.
The bug was introduced in 2.4.21 and is still there in the latest 2.4 
build but it's fixed in 2.6-test11, as I could see.
A search on google showed that the bug was already documented by Kyle 
Davenport (kdd@tvmax.net) on 2003-07-03 17:10:09 PST.
Cheers, David
