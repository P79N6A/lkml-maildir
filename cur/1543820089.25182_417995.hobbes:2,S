The problem is you need #ifdef's everywhere.
If part of a header file is part of the userspace ABI, this often means 
that you need #ifdef __KERNEL__'s for the #include's of headers that 
will not be part of the userspace ABI (like linux/compiler.h).
And how do you express that in header foo.h, the userspace part requires 
the userspace part of bar.h, while the kernel-internal part of foo.h 
also requires the kernel-internal part of bar.h?
And reading through header files doesn't become easier after adding five 
#ifdef __KERNEL__'s to a header file.

I'm sorry, but I don't like your approach.
