Thank-you.  I suspect you're right.
Could you also provide some motivation for the other changes in your
patch, moving struct cpuset, enum cpuset_flagbits_t, and struct cpuset
top_cpuset definitions from kernel/cpuset.c to include/linux/cpuset.h?
I had found it rather pleasing that these structures did not need to
be known outside of kernel/cpuset.c.
Another approach that might work, in order to ensure that the top_cpuset
has its cpus_allowed set to the proper value of cpu_possible_map, would
be to add a routine, say cpuset_init_smp(), called from init/main.c
init() just after smp_init() returns, to update the cpus_allowed in
top_cpuset from the fully initialized value of cpu_possible_map.  This
seems to resemble the call sched_init_smp(), also made in init/main.c
init() just after smp_init() returns, to finish initializing some sched
stuff.
If you take your approach, should we remove the __init qualifier from
kernel/cpuset.c cpuset_init()?
