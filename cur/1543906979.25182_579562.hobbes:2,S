Three runs each of noatime, relatime and atime, both with cold caches
and with warm caches.  Scripts below.  Run on a Thinkpad T40, 1.5GHz,
2GiB RAM, 60GB 2.5" IDE disk, ext3.
Biggest difference between atime and noatime (median run, cold cache) is
~2.3%, nowhere near the numbers claimed by Ingo.  Ingo, how did you
measure 10% and more?
