I am trying to finish a driver to write to a small lcd screen.  I can write
to the screen all day but I need to get the write function to work.  This is
under kernel 2.2.16-22.  I started with the tagged fops set up.  Then to see
if it made a difference I fully declared the fops structure making sure all
the positions were acounted for with NULL or fuction call.  I basically have
nothing but open, release, read, write and llseek defined.  I selected a
major of 200 after not seeing it defined.  The device loads fine.  I made a
test program for it, which opens the device, writes one line and then
closes.  When I try to write,in the test, the debug statements for read
function come up and I get an oops.
Everything says that the write I wrote and placed in fops structure should
be called.  What I am trying to write to device is: struct lcdpacket{int
line;char text[18]};
I have tried to change places of read and write but those incompatible
pointers keep coming up.
I am debating on going on list, but please cc me right now.
