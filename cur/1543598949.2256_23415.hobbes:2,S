Hello guys!
I tried to include pc_keyb.h into my project, but it fails:
In file included from test_pc_keybh.c:1:
/usr/include/linux/pc_keyb.h:127: parse error before `wait_queue_head_t'
/usr/include/linux/pc_keyb.h:127: warning: no semicolon at end of struct
or union
/usr/include/linux/pc_keyb.h:130: parse error before `}'
I tried to include linux/sched.h before, but that didn't work either
(seems to have problems with sys/time.h).
What to do ?
Sincerly,
Nico
