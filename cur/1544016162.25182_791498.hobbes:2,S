I will argue that, yes.

I don't like "extend" in this context.  I'd prefer to think of it as a
side-band solution that we need.  And yes, such a solution COULD
obsolete mcelog.  Do you have such a solution done?  Specced?

It's not particularly quirky - it's a fixed-size ringbuffer.  You're
trying to spin it as some eccentric interface designed by tripped-out
hippies, but it's not really.  It's just a simple piece of plumbing
for a very specific purpose, which exists because there was no better
answer at the time (is there one now?)

I'm 100% on board with that and will even help staff the effort.  This
is something that is VERY HIGHLY desired here.  I already have a
couple peopel looking at this and other HW-error reporting issues.

Thanks!
