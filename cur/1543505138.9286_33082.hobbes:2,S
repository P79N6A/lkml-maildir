They thought about this, but there are some very very inconvient problems
with ripping every internet router out and enforcing mandatory IP-AH on
all routers with key exchanges and webs of trust.
Sometimes mathematics forces bad over "not possible"

IPv6 has a much higher minimum MTU, the issue basically doesnt arise as the
attacks dont work.
