As a crude data point of idle system running a full kde desktop environment on 
powersave with minimal backlight and just chatting on IRC I find it's just 
under 10% battery life difference. I have confirmed in the past the accuracy 
of the remaining capacity exported by the battery and the time to complete 
discharge. This saving is similar in magnitude to the 1000->100Hz savings of 
7% mentioned on other threads. While nothing like the 25% initially suggested 
it is still significant. Anyone with a more accurate means of testing this 
interested?
Cheers,
Con
