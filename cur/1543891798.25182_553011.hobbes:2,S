One caveat with this... md.o needs xor.o to be initialized first.
Moving xor.o under lib/ means this assumption is broken since the
top-level Makefile puts 'libs' after 'drivers'.

Herbert can I move async_tx under crypto since the engines I am working
with have support for algorithms like CRC32C and Galois Field Multiply
(raid6 p+q)?
