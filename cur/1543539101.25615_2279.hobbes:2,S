Hi,
most(all?) modern PC chipsets support so called system
control port (0x92) which provides A20 line handling
along with other features.
AFAIK bit 1 of 0x92 port control A20 line:
        0 - A20 disable / forced 0 (real mode)
        1 - A20 address line enable
But I didn't try it, you warned :)).
Best wishes,
        Andrey
