Yeah. I'm kinda suprised about that not being resolved yet. Basically
you had to have been lucky. Either you got it before it was withdrawn,
you managed to find it in some dark corner of the net or you managed
to get it off a friend who got it. Other then that you're SOL.
I've managed to get ahold of it. the 112->2.1 patch, 2.1 crypt lib and
2.1 linuxthreads.
None of this, ofcourse, helps to answer your question but I felt like
'bragging' ;)
