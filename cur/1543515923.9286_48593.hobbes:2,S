  Hi, all. Someone broke CSLIP as a module in 2.3.27. The slip.o
module requires various things from slhc.o, but slhc.o is nowhere to
be found. In theory slhc.o is linked into the kernel, but because
nothing else is referencing symbols in slhc.o, the linker "optimises"
it away.
This is not the first time I've seen this linker behaviour cause
problems. While the behaviour is reasonable for user-space, the kernel
is an odd beast (particularly with the loadable modules). Maybe we
need a --link-the-whole-bloody-lot-i-dont-care-if-it-looks-unused flag
for the linker.
Or better yet, a
--check-this-object-for-used-symbols-but-dont-include-it=file.o
switch.
Right now, every time this problem crops up, someone has to go in and
find ways to work around the linker.
