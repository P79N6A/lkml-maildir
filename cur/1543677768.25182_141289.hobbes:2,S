NAPI enables a software polling mode, or software interrupt migitation 
if you prefer to call it that.  It kicks in at moderate to high packet 
rates, allows the net stack to more globally balance net traffic, and 
avoids problems associated with high packet load / DoS situations which 
would otherwise max out a cpu.
But it's a new feature, so being conservative there is a staged rollout, 
with NAPI support in e100[0] being an option that can be turned off. 
Some drivers like tg3 simply always enable NAPI.
