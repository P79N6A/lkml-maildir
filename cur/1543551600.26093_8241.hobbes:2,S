ok, it's simpler now since I've updated it on my web
server this morning. You can download it from :
  
http://wtarreau.free.fr/pub/linux-patches/bonding/
I'll have a few minor documentation changes to

Have fun with it, and please tell me if you encounter
problems before I claim "it's working now!".
Willy
