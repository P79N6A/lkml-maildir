Hello all..
I'm interested in making a 16x32 console font, so I can run my 21"
display at 100x37 text. I've asked on the framebuffer list already, but
have heard no reply, and the list seems to be defunct.
Since it's a fixed-frequency display, I want to have the framebuffer and
basic font in-kernel and loaded at boot time. I'm not sure where to find
the necessary tools/documentation to do all the steps, though. Could
someone point me in the right direction?
