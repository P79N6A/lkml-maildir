By the way, I for one use busybox for initramfs stuff, since a long
time ago.  And it (still?) does not support decompression of kernel
modules, as of the latest (1.13) version...  I don't think I'm alone
using busybox this way, and it looks like decompression support
should be added to it first, and next to the kernel.. ;)
