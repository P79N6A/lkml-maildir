Sorry about the fat-fingered send, as before:

int hex_char_to_int(char ch)
{
	return -1 if not [a-fA-F0-9]
}
int hex_to_u8(const char *buf, u8 *val)
int hex_to_u16(const char *buf, u16 *val)
int hex_to_u32(const char *buf, u32 *val)
int hex_to_u64(const char *buf, u64 *val)
Which return the number of chars read and reads up to a maximum of
2,4,8,16 chars respectively and returns early if a non-hex char
is encountered.
Thoughts?
