Alan Cox has shed some light on this problem.  He mentions that the
x86 GDT/LDT stuff changed around 2.5.30, which is the time when others
have also reported that their APM has stopped working.  I've not
confirmed whether that is the case for me as well, but it seems to
be highly likely.
I also asked Alan if there's the possibility of backing this out or
making it configurable, but the answer seems to be a most definite
no.  However, maybe Ingo can say otherwise?
This effectively means that people with laptops which do not work
with 2.6 APM nor ACPI can expect their machines to be stuck with 2.4
for the future, unless someone with the necessary knowledge sees this
problem as important enough to solve.
It also means that I'm never going to be able to test PCMCIA suspend
under real conditions with the hardware I have available to me.  This
in turn brings up the question of passing PCMCIA off to someone else
to maintain and test for 2.6.  However, I remain willing to continue
the development, albiet limited by the working hardware I have
available to me.
Do we have any willing volunteers?
