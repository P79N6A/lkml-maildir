No offence taken. In fact I seem to remember filing similar bugs at the
time about rpm/popt getting its help formatting wrong in some locales (eg
Welsh) for similar reasons - but that was some time ago.
All the mainstream tools handle utf-8 just fine, joe is quite happy
editing utf-8 these days (as are the legacy vim and emacs editing
tools ;)). There really are no good reasons left not to use UTF-8.
