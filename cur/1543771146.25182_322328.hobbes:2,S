Andrea,
I've been involved with understanding/fighting this patent for a very
long time. I must have read it at least a dozen times. To the best of
my understanding as a non-lawyer, I don't see how PREEMPT_RT could
fall as being covered by it.

What you are refering to is claim #7. The text does resemble this, but it's
in a wider context of all the other statements within that claim, the main
part being what I quoted earlier.
Now in regards to emulating interrupts in a general purpose OS, then this
has been done many times over prior to the patent. Here's one readily
available example in the Unix world:

Please drop this one Andrea.
