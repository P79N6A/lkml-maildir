They are, at least for everything that can (could ...) run Windows NT for
which strong ordering is a requirement.  This only covers ordering for
cached memory accesses; ordering between cached and uncached accesses or
uncached accesses is no generally strongly ordered and even for cached
memory optionally more liberal ordering may be available as an option.
