Binary drivers are not something that make a lot of sense on
Linux. While a particular distribution might want to do this to
support it's particular version of a kernel, I can't see this going
much farther beyond this.
It would be handy if someone made a shar tool that would
automatically build and install a given driver. This way 3rd party
source drivers which didn't make it in to the kernel tree could be
setup by your average user (until the kernel changed enough that it
broke the compile ;-).
Of course, for the most part, this isn't necessary, as device support
for most of the devices Linux can work with comes with each
kernel. This encourages vendors to get their drivers into the kernel,
which in turn makes it MUCH easier to update all the necessary drivers
when a change is made to the kernel which impacts drivers.
