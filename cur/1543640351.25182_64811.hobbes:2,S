I actually looked at this a bit for embedded applications - there's a
technique for pulling entropy from free-running clock skew.
Unfortunately with modern chipsets, just about all clocks are
generated from a single source these days. This is even true in the
non-x86 world now. Any extra clocks you have are likely to be out in
peripheral-land and too slow (serial port) or too inaccessible (VGA
dot clocks) to be interesting.

Thankfully.
