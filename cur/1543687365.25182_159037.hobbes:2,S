Sorry, but I still have the starving problem. the more I use O16/O17 the
more problems I encounter. xterms sometimes wake up after half a second
for another half a second and falls asleep for a whole second then.
after that, it's fully interactive. io-load seems to produce the
problem. a simple tar xf linux-2.6.0-test3.tar seems to halt the system.
new processes take ages to start. This also happend to me on O16.2.
Maybe it's because some AS patches are missing in vanilla but are in
2.6.0-test3-mm?
