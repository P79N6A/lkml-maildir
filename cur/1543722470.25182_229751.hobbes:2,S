Here's the actual code, I typoed this first time.
	/* count partitions 1 to 15 with sizes > 0 */
	for(i=1; i <MAX_PART; i++) {
		if (!disk->part[i])
			continue;
		if (disk->part[i]->nr_sects != 0)
			luninfo.num_parts++;
We're trying to figure how many partitions are physically on the disk. We do
this for one of our utilities. Is there a kernel API that will return this
data for us?
