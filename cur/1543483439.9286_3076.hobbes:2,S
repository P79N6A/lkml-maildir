Ok this is 2.0.37pre5. It fixes the obvious glaring bugs that pre4 found.
What I do still have is a big pile of often muddled updates because I've
got several versions from people sometimes of indeterminable age that
piled up while 2.2 got a bit hectic.
Im missing some updates (pptp for one). Can people whose stuff isnt there
please send new diffs _versus 2.0.37pre5_.
