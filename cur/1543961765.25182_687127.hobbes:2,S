I'd wondered about that one too, but no: lmbench lat_pagefault uses
a shared mmap of an ordinary file (not /dev/zero), so the ZERO_PAGE
changes should have no effect on it whatsoever.
I notice that test is expecting msync(,,MS_INVALIDATE) to do something
it's never done on Linux (a kind of drop caches for the range).  We've
never done anything with MS_INVALIDATE, beyond permitting the flag:
I think you find problems however you try to go about implementing
it (and it might even originate from a UNIX which couldn't do shared
mmap coherently).  So I wonder if that test is erratic because of it.
