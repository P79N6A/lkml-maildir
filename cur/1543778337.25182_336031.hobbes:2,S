Quote from that document:
 "Data is more dense as it moves toward the center, resulting in less
  physical movement of the head. This results in faster overall
  throughput"
This is not true. The whole idea of different recording zones with
different sectors/track is to keep the overall data density (in
bits/square mm) more or less constant.
I'd say it's even the other way around from what IBM pictures: there
are more sectors/track in outer zones, so that means there is simply
more data in the outer zones. If you want less physical movement of the
head, you should make sure the data is in the zone(s) with the largest
number of sectors/track.
