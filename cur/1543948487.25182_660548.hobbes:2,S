This is gmail which has broken line wrapping I cannot fix. Anyway, I
did build the new kernel but it still does not work for me. I tried to
strace, but that didn't work for me either. This is as a non-root user
(and same 'at'/'atd' binaries work on 2.6.23.X):

My kenrel .config is big, so it is attached so I don't get any cut and
paste error.

Because maybe I'm doing something stupid and didn't patch/rebuild
something when changing kernels like I should.  I haven't had trouble
with at for many years of kernel changes, but 2.6.24 was the first
with the new security stuff and maybe I need to have some
capability-aware 'at' program?

Do I need to recompile glibc and the at software to adjust so some
kernel interface changes?  Did the 'make oldconfig' generate some bad
config combination?  As root it works, so I don't think the at or atd
are broken (but maybe they have to be patched for >2.6.23.X ?)

Thank you for reading.  Any ideas on what to try next?
