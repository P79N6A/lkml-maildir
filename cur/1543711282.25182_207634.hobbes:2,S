I have no emotional attachment to any of the names.  If we can come up with 
a more sensible name then all for the best.  I was trying to find something 
which implied the 'measurement' thing which didn't overlap with any of the 
other memory grouping concepts.  As the domains overlap nodes and zones.

Yes this is the main reason for the name change.  This is at the dirty hack 
stage in that sense, minimal changes to prove the concept.  I think that we 
should be changing all the callers if this is going mainline in the longer 
term.  Although then the do cross 4 architecture and with it being in the 
security interface it also interfaces with selinux as well (sigh).
I'll put together a more complete change over of the interface, keep the 
name the same and see how intrusive that seems.  Then we'll get some 
testing on it.

Steven, I'll send you a copy of the patch under separate cover.
