Since I personally loath the standard "RTFM" response, I'll try and
explain briefly.
Think of static volumes as containers for chunks of whole binary data.
You don't want partial updates to this data, or it's inconsistent.  So a
static volume must be written wholesale.  As UBI writes out the data,
each block has a field in the VID header with the data size and the CRC
for that block.
Take a vmlinux binary for example.  By putting that in a static UBI
volume, a bootloader can read each block in the volume in order, verify
the block CRC and know that the resulting reconstructed image is valid.
If the CRC doesn't match on a block, the data is invalid and the
bootloader can do whatever it determines to be the correct behavior.
One could arguably create a new MTD interface called "update" and
provide only that and the read function for static volumes.  But that is
essentially what has been done within UBI itself.  I won't speak for
Artem, who could explain much more than I as to why it was done the way
it currently is.
