Mel, does the patch below fix this bug for you? (Note: you will need to 
enable CONFIG_SCHEDSTATS=y too.)
if yes, then Linus please pull this single fix from:

risk is low: the new code only runs with CONFIG_SCHEDSTATS=y 
(default:off) and profile=sleep (default:off), so it ought to be fairly 
safe to add at this point. (and we had very similar code in v2.6.22 
anyway)

fix sleep profiling - we lost this chunk in the CFS merge.
