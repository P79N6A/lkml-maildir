Hi friends,
I've askeed questions about errors compiling kernel modules caused by 
including <stdio.h> and got some very helpful info here.
I changed those I/O stream and file operation in the code and get the 
module compiled, however, there would be warnings like
In file included from /home/lei/modules/test.c:49:
/home/lei/modules/Kcomp.h:21: warning: function declaration isn't a 
prototype
/home/lei/modules/Kcomp.h:27: warning: function declaration isn't a 
prototype
/home/lei/modules/Kcomp.h:69: warning: function declaration isn't a 
prototype
And the no prototype fuction looks like
int preset() // with no arguments
{
	p = &nodes[0][0];
	return 0;
}
So when I tried to install the module with insmod ./test.ko ,
there would be an error,
insmod: error inserting './test.ko': -1 Unknown symbol in module
Could anyone tell me what is wrong here? Is that because of the no 
prototype function declaration?
TIA
Lei
