Hi,
plz CC the reply to sushey@yahoo.com since i'm not
subscried.
My questions:
1. Are the buffer cache and the page cache connected
somehow? Does every write to the disk pass through the
buffer cache and if no what uses does the bufer cache
have now ... (kernel >= 2.4)
2. As i saw in the source code reading a page (if not
in the page cache) is done from the disk directly ...
have i missed something ?
3. Few articles i've read claimed that Buffer Cache
and Page cashe are 2 cache levels ... is that right
for kernel >= 2.4 ?
Thanks alot in advance,
Its very important for me to understand these things
:)
sushey
