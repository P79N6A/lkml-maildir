Hi,
Under 2.2.0pre? WordPerfect8 and KDE apps hang X (keyboard and mouse):
The bug seems to show itself only in a certain configuration.
2.2.0pre?, X 3.3.3 SVGA, xfstt (xfstt causes the whole thing).
I've changed xfstt to 0.9.10 and it stopped to hang :D
Then, to my surprise, after two reboots it hanged... :((((
I've changed NOTHING in the configuration.
Oh, it doesn't show up under 2.1.132.
