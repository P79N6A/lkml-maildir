Yes, they do sometimes. But that's not right since 'sw' is at least
sometimes treated as an abbreviation for swap. Suspend2 isn't limited to
writing to swap. That (along with the fact that swsusp is an ugly
acronym) is the reason why I've tried to push away from using that term.

If they're clearly differentiated, that shouldn't be a problem. In fact,
it would help differentiate them.
