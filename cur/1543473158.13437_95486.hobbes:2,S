It's a static variable.  As such, it constitutes saved state.  Your proposed 
alternative doesn't do the same thing:
| 	return 1
+--->8
Causes it to report that a low-memory condition has been exited as soon as 
there are more than a minimum number available; the code above remembers "we 
ran out of memory" until the available memory reaches a high-water mark, 
avoiding serious thrashing where the available memory drops to the low-water 
mark and stays there, causing a low-memory condition on virtually every 
successive memory allocation.

     We are Linux. Resistance is an indication that you missed the point.
