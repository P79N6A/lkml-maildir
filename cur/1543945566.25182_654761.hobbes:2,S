you found a great set of bugs..
but to be honest... I suspect it's just best to remove unlikely altogether for these cases;
unlikely() is almost a go-faster-stripes thing, and if you don't know how to use it you shouldn't
be using it... so just removing it for all wrong cases is actually the best thing to do imo.
