Losing it is a bit worrying,  You might miss some interrupts in the sense
of taking > 1/4000th of a second to service them but it shouldnt miss any.

If it is marked twice and not running then it will execute once only. If
it is running then further mark_bh() calls will ensure it is run once
again.

No

They interrupt status is left queued. There is no guarantee that 4000
interrupts/second will produce 4000 irq's second - if any irq is pending
then it wont get raised twice - its just a signal on a bus.
