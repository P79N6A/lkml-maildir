It is ROM region of your graphics card. Could you do
lspci -vx
and look at four bytes at offset 0x30 - these are ROM regions.
And BIOS did not correct work either for Millennium or for another device.
You can try 'pci=rom', maybe it says anything after
PCI: Address space collision ... then. But as long as Matrox ROM region
is in question, matroxfb does not need it... XFree needs it, but I think
that they use legacy region at 0xC0000 instead of PCI ROM region.
                                                Best regards,

BTW, Martin, do you have/plan lspci which displays ROM region, by any chance?
Neither lspci nor /proc/pci seems to display it.
