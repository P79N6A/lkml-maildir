This is why I suggest to have 
CONFIG_TCP_ZERO_COPY_TRANSFER_COMPLETION_NOTIFICATION disabled in 
general kernels. ISCSI-SCST will still work with almost no performance 
loss for in-kernel backend and people would better recompile kernel, 
then patch it, then recompile.

I'll ask in linux-mm, thanks for the suggestion.

To have net_priv analog in skb was the first idea I was tried. But I 
quickly gave up, because it would required that all the pages in each 
skb_frag_struct be from the same originator, i.e. with the same 
net_priv. It is unpractical to change all the operations with skb's to 
forbid merging them, if they have different net_priv. There are too many 
such places in very not obvious code pieces.

I don't think there is any layering violation here. Just lower layer 
notifies upper layer that transmission of a page has finished. It's done 
a bit not straightforward, but still basically the same as, for 
instance, on_free_cmd() callbacks which SCST core uses to notify target 
drivers and dev handlers that the corresponding command is about to be 
freed, so they can free associated with it data as well.
Thanks,
