Well, the most reliable way to get a core dump when you trash the
stack or something is to have no SIGSEGV handler at all. :)
In any case, there are all sorts of things that could go wrong and
leave the process stuck in an infinite loop.  If you really want a
core dump when things go wrong then you probably need some sort of
watchdog process plus a way for one process to force another to dump
core and exit (like a SIGKILL but with a core dump as well).

On PPC?  Sounds like you are overrunning an array on the stack and
clearing the stack backchain word.

You haven't convinced me that the kernel is doing anything wrong or
even suboptimal - it seems to me that you have run into some
unintended consequences of your code, that's all.  You can't expect
the kernel to work around all the bugs in your user processes. :)
