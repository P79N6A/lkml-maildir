As Andrew suggested, Ogawa Hirofumi, FAT maintainer post
following patch. I may help you. Please check it.
Message-Id: <87wthrznsv.fsf@devron.myhome.or.jp>
Subject: Re: [EXPERIMENT] Add new "flush" option
	This adds new "flush" option for hotplug devices.
	Current implementation of "flush" option does,
	- synchronizing data pages at ->release() (last close(2))
	- if user's work seems to be done (fs is not active), all
	  metadata syncs by pdflush()
	This option would provide kind of sane progress, and dirty buffers is
	flushed more frequently (if fs is not active).  This option doesn't
	provide any robustness (robustness is provided by other options), but
	probably the option is proper for hotplug devices.
	(Please don't assume that dirty buffers is synchronized at any point.
	This implementation will be changed easily.)
