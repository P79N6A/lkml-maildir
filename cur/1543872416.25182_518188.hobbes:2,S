As far as I understand and recognize it,
  [have monospaced font]
  paravirt struct      struct file_operations / {ALSA | OSS}
   ^                    ^
   |      <- API ->     |
   v                    v
  VMI                  /dev/dsp
   ^                    ^
   |      <- ABI ->     |
   v                    v
  product              userspace app
I think the sound example to the right really shows it. /dev/dsp has a
consistent ABI on a ton of systems. The API below it, varies. Linux got
file_operations and ALSA. Solaris/BSD may have its
vnode-and-so-on-functions and some sort of OSS.
Hope this helps (and more, I hope it's accurate - please correct me if I
am wrong.)
Jan
