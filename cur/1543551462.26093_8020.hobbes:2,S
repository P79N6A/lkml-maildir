The AMD/Elan box snoops for the sequence sent to the keyboard
controller to enable A<20>. However, it also respects the port
0x92 control. Linux-2.2.17 doesn't have the 0x92 control so
it must have been added recently.
The AMD/Elan chip also comes to life after a hardware reset with
A<20> enabled. So, if you don't turn it OFF, there won't be any
problem during the protected-mode transition.
