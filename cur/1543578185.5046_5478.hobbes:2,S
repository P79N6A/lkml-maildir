   Jes has also got hard numbers for the performance advantages of
   jumbograms on some of the networks he's been using, and you ain't
   going to get udp jumbograms through a page-by-page API, ever.
Again, see MSG_MORE in the patches.  It is possible and our UDP
implementation could make it easily.
Later,
