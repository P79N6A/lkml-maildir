Could you please attach the output of 'cat 00:0a/resources' (0a is the
device, right?). ACPI spec said set resource should be according to the
output of current resource. That is we should build a template according
to current resource (_CRS). If _CRS doesn't return a correct resource
templete, set resource will fail.
Adam, I think a boot option (such as pnpacpi=off) is required. Users
possibly want to use pnpbios or BIOS is buggy.
Thanks,
