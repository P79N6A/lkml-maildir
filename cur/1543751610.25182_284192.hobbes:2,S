Christ, what a nightmare!  Since when does "obviously doable" mean it's
a good idea?  Please, reread your above statements, then go back and
look at the realtime LSM patch (it's less than 200 lines), and tell me
again that your way is more secure.
Please keep in mind that there are already 1000s of users using the
realtime LSM to do audio work.  Sorry, but I will take a known good,
well understood, PROVEN solution over "it's obviously doable, it's all
bits anyway".  Get back to me when you have some code, or at least some
reasonable suggestions as Alan, Christoph and others have made.

Wrong, as was said repeatedly, rlimits only help with mlock!  Have you
even been reading the thread?
