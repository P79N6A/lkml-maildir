Too much bloat in the 3dm utility, I use the tw_cli util.
I'm on-site right now, and it turns out it's a double drive failure.
One drive is dead to the point of not even being detected, and the other
is damaged enough that powermax was having difficulty running.
Fortunately the systefiles are completely intact, and it's just a matter
of seeing what backup files are damaged and working around them.
I'll be taking it up with 3ware about why their utility falsely
reported/didn't report the drive failures, according to it the second
drive was just fine.
