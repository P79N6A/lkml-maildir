The hash function isn't good and the hash chains are far from evenly
distributed. There are typically 30-40% empty buckets, while some
others are rather long.
In addition I think only a small fraction of the dentries are actually hot.
(no numbers on that, sorry) 
Your 47MB number doesn't make much sense for lookup tuning because these 
are not walked all the time. Only a few cache lines of the dentry are accessed
for a lookup.
If you think you have a better concept than me to tune it then feel
free to post a patch.

Apply the latest hash patch  and run some statistics over the bucket
distributions from /proc/dcache. You'll quickly see that your ideal model 
does not match reality at all.

The overall cached inodes are not too interesting - it is a long known
problem of linux that it caches too many inodes. But it doesn't matter
here because the dcache does all the hard lookup work and it hash
direct pointers to the inodes (no inode hash lookup needed). Most of them
are just wasted memory, but luckily not wasted cache.
What's interesting is to make the dentry lookup as fast as possible.

Sorry but the average 2 bucket length number is completely unrealistic.
It doesn't make any sense to use it in an argument.

Limiting inode caches is probably a good idea. It's a long standing known
bug. At least definitely do prune inodes not referenced by the dcache
I believe some 2.4 trees fixed that in fact, but these fixes have
likely not moved to 2.5 yet. But really, it makes no difference
for these benchmarks, which have enough memory.
Limiting dcache is probably a bad idea. Recreating the dcache is far 
slower than any hash lookup. And a lot of Linux's good interactive
performance comes from the aggressive dcache caching.
