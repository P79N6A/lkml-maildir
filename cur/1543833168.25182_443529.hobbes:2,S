To make sure user is building modules for kernel it is really using.  Without
this test users were building modules for kernels they have run years ago, and
then complained that modules do not fit to running kernel, or that kernel
crashes when they do 'insmod -f ...'...  So perl wrapper passes linux/version.h
through C preprocessor and compares resulting UTS_RELEASE with `uname -r`, and
complains loudly if they do not match.
