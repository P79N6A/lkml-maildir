I hate to say it Con, but this one seems to have broken the amanda-tar 
symbiosis.
I haven't tried a plain 21-rc3, so the problem may exist there, and in 
fact it did for 21-rc1, but I don't recall if it was true for -rc2.  But 
I will have a plain 21-rc3 running by tomorrow nights amanda run to test.
What happens is that when amanda tells tar to do a level 1 or 2, tar still 
thinks its doing a level 0.  The net result is that the tape is filled 
completely and amanda does an EOT exit in about 10 of my 42 dle's.  This 
is tar-1.15-1 for fedora core 6.
