Hi Bruce,
no, no errors were logged. However, and that was the reason why I
initially saw a connection to the old thread from March 2004 that talked
about SMART tests correlated with these DMA errors:
SMART Self-test log 
# 1  Short offline       Interrupted (host reset)      10%     
#10  Short offline       Interrupted (host reset)      10%     
#15  Short offline       Interrupted (host reset)      10%     
Thus, short offline self-tests were running at the times where the DMA
errors and system hangs occurred.
Further, there seems to be a known problem with SMART related to the
hard drive that I am using:
Device Model:     IC35L040AVER07-0
However, I had been running SMART self-tests without any problems until
that kernel upgrade.
I already turned off SMART self-tests - no crashes so far, but too early
to be sure. Maybe it is just a hard drive problem that did not show up
before. Since I had planned to replace that disk drive anyhow, I will do
that sooner.
Thanks,
Sebastian
