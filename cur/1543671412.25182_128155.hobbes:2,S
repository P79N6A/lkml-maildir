I already told you I could reproduce the bug and that it was known. The
fact that i fixed it for myself is enough for me to know I fixed it for
you too.
Now if I couldn't reproduce the bug, I'd go back to you in a attempt to
test patches and pinpoint the problem. That just isn't the case here.
Once I reproduce the problem, your job is done.

Then you must not be looking in the proper place.

But not all...I personally choose to keep specific discussions about
linux1394 on the linux1394 mailing lists. That's not to say I wont
respond on this list, but it is to say that if I announce something
important, it will be there and only there.
Sounds to me like you want to be in the middle of me and Marcelo. That
neither I nor him have the ability to agree on what patches should and
should not be moved from Linux1394 to the 2.4.x tree. Do you want either
or both of our jobs?
The fact is that the current 2.4.21-rc+bk tree is more stable for
ieee1394 than it was in 2.4.20. The only drawback at this point in time
is the fact that you have to run a single script for sbp2 to scan scsi
devices. I could fill a page with the things that are fixed. I have
_zero_ bug reports about the current tree other than a nagging problem
with a rare TI chip that doesn't seem to fit into OHCI specs too well.
No crashes, no lockups...now that's progress over 2.4.20's ieee1394
tree. I can tell you 20 ways to crash that with something as simple as
replugging a device.
