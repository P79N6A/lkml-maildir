Subject: NFS and RPC question under kernel 2.6

Sorry if this question is dumb.
I am trying to modify NFS to add some more features. I changed the
rpc_clnt struct in include/linux/sunrpc/clnt.h to add some more
fields:
vrpc_comm_t		*cl_comm;
wait_queue_head_t 		cl_callwaitq[MAX_PENDING_REQS];
int 					cl_blocked[MAX_PENDING_REQS]; /* indicates whether a request
is blocked */
svdif_response_t		cl_resp_ring[MAX_PENDING_REQS];
I tried to initialise those fields in  nfs_fill_super function, but
once those initialization codes are executed, if a nfs client tries to
mount a directory, its underlying linux  will crash with the following
dump out:
Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 00000008
 printing eip:

My initialization codes work well on kernel 2.4, but do not work on
2.6. :( I was stuck on this problem for a couple of days.
Can someone help me out? Many thanks in advance!!!
BTW: after I change clnt.h, I recompiled the kernel and restart the
machine, so kernel should know rpc_clnt struct is changed.
