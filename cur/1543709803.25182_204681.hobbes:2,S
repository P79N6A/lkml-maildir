Subject: [PATCH] fadvise invalidating range fix

Hi Andrew
I noticed fadvise(POSIX_FADV_DONTNEED) was invalidating more parts of the file
than I expected. Here is the patch.
Notes for change in fadvise.c/sys_fadvise64_64():
- It should be noticed that the 'end' param of invalidate_mapping_pages()
  is inclusive;
- When 'offset' and/or 'offset+len' do no align to page boundary, we must
  decide whether to abandon the partial page at the beginning/end of the range. 
  My patch assumes that the application is scanning forward,
  which is the most common case.
  So 'end_index' is set to the page just before the ending partial page.
- Manual pages for posix_fadvise() mentioned the case of 'len=0', which
  is not handled by the code. Perhaps the handling of 'len=0' is useless,
  so I leaved that alone.
Notes for change in truncate.c/invalidate_mapping_pages():
- Is there any reason that I din't know to free any page outside of [begin,end]?
  The origin code will abandon useful trailing pages when there's hole
  in the range, which may cause series of unecessary disk I/O in
  streaming applications.
best regards, Wu Fengguang
