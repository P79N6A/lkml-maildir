I guess you could replace page->end with the (expensive)
page_address(page) + 1 in new_slab.
You would also have to change slab_address() to use
page_address(page). Since this is used by check_valid_pointer, I am not
sure it's a good idea to use this slow operation there.
Or maybe you have a different alternative in mind ?
