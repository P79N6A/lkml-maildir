Subject: RF driver!!
Hi all,
 
I am porting a pcmcia rf driver (which worked on kernel 2.2.12)
to kernel 2.4.0 on my MIPS machine.
 
1. I found there are some diffenence in netdevice.h.
    The structure device changed to net_device.
 
2. And the tbusy, start, interrupt were gone with 
    the use of the netif_start_queue, netif_stop_queue,
    netif_wake_queue and related functions.
 
How do I use these functions to modify the 2.2.12 rf driver to 2.4.0 ??
 
Thanks,
 
Green
