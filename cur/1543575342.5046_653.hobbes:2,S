Definitely not unless the devices are buggy and need a work-around.
For PC's, we've until now relied on the BIOS setting up cache line sizes
correctly. Are the "8"'s you've spotted due to drivers messing with the
cache line register or do they come from the BIOS?

I haven't written this function, but I guess it's expected to be called
from the architecture specific device enabling code and that some architectures
have to call it, some don't.
				Have a nice fortnight
