Normal apps like cp are ending because of Input/Output error. 
I did some researches and 
dd if=/dev/hdc of=image.iso conv=noerror,sync bs=1M 
does everything I want for whole Video Dvds. It skips unreadable blocks.
But I get recorded tv shows from friends and there is the same as with 
scratched dvds. Now the problem is that there are several .avi files on it. 
So I cannot use dd.

It would be enough that the drive does not report it as a error. If it would 
be a warning it may be skipped.

How can I figure this out? The best way would be a special command that all 
user apps can use which tells the drive to skip all of these bad blocks. With 
this you could turn it on if you want to watch movies where single bytes are 
not that important or turn it off if you want to have a identical copy of the 
dvd.
By the way, I am surprised that I am the only one who has problems with this.
