This is a bug in the compiler, but the gcc developers stopped any 
development on 2.95 long time ago.
Besides the fact that you'd have to wait half a year (or maybe two
years) until Debian 3.1 releases to get the fix if it was fixed, I doubt
anyone of the Debian gcc maintainers would spend his time on fixing bugs 
in gcc 2.95 .
You might have luck with trying to use the gcc-3.0 in stable to compile 
your kernel, but since I doubt anyone backported gcc 3.2 or 3.3 for 
alpha to the pretty ancient Debian stable it might be that the only way 
to get kernel 2.6 running for you would be to try to locally modify 
airo.c in a way that your gcc compiles it.
