On the system that fails, there are no ulimits and it's the root
account, therefore I don't know how to set the above limit to
RLIM_INFINITY (~0LU).  It's also version  2.4.20. I don't think
it has anything to do with 'rlim' shown above. In any event
sending a signal when the file-size exceeds some level is preposterous.
The write should return -1 and errno should have been set to EFBIG
(in user space). That allows the user's database to create another
file and keep on trucking instead of blowing up and destroying the
user's inventory or whatever else was in process.
FYI, this caused the failure of a samba server for M$ stuff. It
gives the impression of Linux being defective. This is not good.
Cheers,

Why is the government concerned about the lunatic fringe? Think about it.
