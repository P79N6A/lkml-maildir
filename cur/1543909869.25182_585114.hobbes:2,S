If you're referring to the code in sk_stream_mem_schedule
then it's working as intended.  The atomicity guarantees
that the atomic_add/atomic_sub won't be seen in parts by
other readers.
We certainly do not need to see other atomic_add/atomic_sub
operations immediately.
If you're referring to another code snippet please cite.

An int won't work here because += and -= do not have the
atomicity guarantees that atomic_add/atomic_sub do.  In
particular, this may cause an atomic_read on another CPU
to give a bogus reading.
