 Do you have sources for the driver?  Last time I looked at the driver, it
was binary-only (the distribution contained a copy of the GNU GPL, yet the
vendor refused to release sources I asked for) and it seemed to be broken
horribly.  Be happy at least it works for you with interrupts routed
through the 8259A.
