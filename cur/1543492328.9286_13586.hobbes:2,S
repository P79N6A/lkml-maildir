Here's a curio:  I've installed 2.2.5 on an old 486 with one
of the early 16-bit soundblasters and while the sound works
perfectly, and /proc/sound shows everything normal, MIDI has
ceased to function.
More accurately, playmidi just loads and exists without any
report of errors or any sound.  The only error I can raise is
an invalid device message while installing MIDI patches through
Rosegarden.
I checked DejaNews and found many reports of this same problem, but I
also notice that while Configuration.help lists CONFIG_SOUND_MIDI as
the switch to enable the /dev/sequencer, the xconfig does not allow
this option, and adding it by hand, the option gets dropped when I run
make oldconfig --- my guess is this is intentional since I have no
problems running MIDI files using an MSS-based ASUS-P5A sound
daughterboard using the same kernel (but obviously a different sound
config)
I dimly remembered, many kernels ago, needing to install sb
patches, and sure enough, deep in /etc I found drum.sb and std.sb
but for the life of me I can't remember how these were installed.
Could installing these patches be the fix?
