Not always. Take for example the case where you have an NFS mount and
happen to be doing an ls when the suspend cycle is started. If you
signal the NFSd threads before the ls thread, the NFS threads will
refrigerate okay, but the ls thread will fail to stop because it's
waiting for data from the nfsd threads.
The best way to test the reliability of the current freezer
implementation is to grab Michael's test patches. They can load the
system down with NFS access, kernel compiles, benchmarks and so on.
You'll quickly see the freezer fail. My implementation handles those
loads flawlessly, and where problems are found, they're easily fixed.
Regards,
Nigel
