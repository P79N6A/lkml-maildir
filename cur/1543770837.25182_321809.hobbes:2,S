Paths entering back into userspace are simple like the use of read() to
respond to events.

Sorry, the RT patch really doesn't effect general kernel development
dramatically. It's just exploiting SMP work already in place to get data
safety and the like. It does however kill all bogus points in the kernel
that spin-waits for something to happen, which is a positive thing for the
kernel in general since it indicated sloppy code. If anything it makes the
kernel code cleaner.
