And how is this portable on complex multibus architectures, where the
PCI access goes through a couple of transports before hitting the PCI
hardware ?
volatile has no notion of serialization. volatile guarantees that the
compiler does not optimize and cache seemingly static values, i.e. it
disables compiler optimizations.
