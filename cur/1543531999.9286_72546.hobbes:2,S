	Problem comes when you have two sensitivity labels that are not
able to be hierarchically compared.  They may be at equal sensitivity levels
but may be in disparate categories that have no ordering -- like say, you have
the "Harvard University" category and the "Yale University" category that have
no intrinsic comparable value (other than of the attendees or proponents of 
such :-)).  They both have the same sensitivity level (say "Faculty" vs. say
"Undergrad").  But kernel can't determine a hierarchy for the categories.

	Separate hardware may be the ideal.  It might be that researchers
at Harvard and Yale might both wish to have a 256P machine, but the reality
is that both schools might not be able to afford such a machine and but
might be able to 'copurchase' such a machine but still want secure 
separation for their research.  Covert channels as referred to by Alan C. and
Jesse P. may have acceptably low bit rates (say <10 bits/second) if what
they are working on are Gigabit datasets.  Obviously, we'd like to know what
covert channels are possible and what the maximum bit rate of each is, so
Harvard and Yale can decide if those are acceptable.  Their requirements
might be different than say if Caltech U. and Stanford U. were to share a
machine.

	Ok, zap forward to future.  US and Euro countries decide to band
together to buy a 256GP machine -- to predict the weather, among other things.
Now we have incomparable entities (unless you want to start a squabble).  Mr.
Pres is at the same priority level as other country leaders, but is
'incomparable' to them.  We can't prioritize memory within that group.  If
there ia memory shortage, Mr. Prez can lobby congress and the other Euro
nations for more memory on the 256Giga-processor machine.  But he won't
be running along and have his vi session killed out from under him (though
the concept is a bit amusing...:-)).
