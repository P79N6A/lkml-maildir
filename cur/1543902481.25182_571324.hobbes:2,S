CPUID is hardly something you want to give up for modern embedded stuff.
 I haven't seen any new embedded stuff using anything less than a 586,
and even those are disappearing quickly in favor of Geode and VIA.
However, compressed size reductions as an abstract thing is useful for
this market.  Just not these particular ones.  The first thing to get
there is probably an LZMA-based compressor instead of gzip.
