ACK - there are so many patents out there (where many them are granted
for software as such, trivial, prior art and/or combinations of them)

Yes, also. But I was here refering to software in general, e.g. the
excess of the browser war in creating new HTML entities which were
silently used by the own "WYSIWYG-HTML-Editor" (as if such could exist -
not even in theory).

Hardware-related, ACK.
