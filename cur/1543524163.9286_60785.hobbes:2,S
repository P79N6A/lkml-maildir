Yeah, I went back and checked it and sure enough it works great (Jamie
pointed it out first).  It took me about 20 seconds to write the perl that
switches syntax, though, so how about we stick to getting initializers
in place and then we can hash out syntax? :)
The entire syntax thread is moot unless it looks like struct initialization
cleanup patches are going to get accepted in the first place :)
