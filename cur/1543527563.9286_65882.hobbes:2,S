Does such a bestie exist?
Its based on the PLX PCI9052 PCI bus target interface chip.
It has a Holtek HT65521R multi io chip on it.
I have found the data sheet for the PLX chip.  I cannot find
a data sheet for the Holtek chip...
If this driver does not exist... How hard is it to write a serial device driver?
Same for a parallel device driver?  
Thanks,
Mike Panetta
