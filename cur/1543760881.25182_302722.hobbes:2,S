I guess incr is as good as any, I thought you would put the "against base" 
somewhere, having already decided to do incrementals. Hopefully you will
at least change the numbering on the patch file (no, not the version in
the Makefile), so patch 2.6.11.3i is againt 2.6.11.2, and 2.6.11.3 is
against 2.6.11. That way people can tell after the download which one they
have if they forget.
I didn't like the initial decision to go incremental, and I even less like
changing now, but it's the right thing to do. It's not like we have a big
investment in scripts or anything, and you're doing the work.
