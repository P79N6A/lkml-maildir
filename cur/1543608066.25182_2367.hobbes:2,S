Hello
Here is the output I get :
00:00.0 Class 0600: 8086:2500 (rev 03)
         Flags: bus master, fast devsel, latency 0
         Memory at f8000000 (32-bit, prefetchable) [size=64M]
         Capabilities: [a0] AGP version 2.0
01:00.0 Class 0300: 10de:0028 (rev 11)
         Subsystem: 1048:0c20
         Flags: bus master, 66Mhz, medium devsel, latency 248, IRQ 10
         Memory at f4000000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=16M]
         Memory at f6000000 (32-bit, prefetchable) [size=32M]

I was trying to tweak myself the agp code (well, mostly by copying the 
intel_generic_setup stuff to a intel_i820_setup stuff, but I guess there 
is a more clever way !). Maybe I can help with this ?
I guess that the device id's that must be added into 'agp.h' look like 
this :
#ifndef PCI_DEVICE_ID_INTEL_820_0
#define PCI_DEVICE_ID_INTEL_820_0       0x2500
#endif
/* [...] */
#ifndef PCI_DEVICE_ID_INTEL_820_1
#define PCI_DEVICE_ID_INTEL_820_1       0x250f
#endif
is it correct ?
Nicolas.
