NO. That's not what you're doing at all. You're calculating something
completely different that "dead swap page". You're calculating "do we have
a swap cache entry that is not mapped into any virtual memory"?

Which is complete crap. Those reference bits are valid and important
data. You have not computed anything that says otherwise. You have
computed a random number that doesn't tell you anything about whether the
page is dead or not.

YOUR HEURISTIC IS WRONG!

So tell me: what does the above help?
I repeat: your "dead_swap_page" variable is a random number with
absolutely no meaning. ANYTHING that uses it is buggy. It doesn't help in
the least if you use the first random state to set another random
state: the amount of randomness does not increase or decrease.
See?

I can see the intent.
I can also see that the code doesn't match up to the intent.
I call that a bug. You don't. Fine.
But that code isn't coming anywhere _close_ to my tree until the two
match. And I stand by my assertion that it should be reverted from Alans
tree too.
