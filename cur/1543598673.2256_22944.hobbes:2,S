Simple answer - no.
The reason it can't is in two parts:
1. these daemons create their own socket rather than recieving one
   from inetd.
2. The daemons must connect to rpcbind or portmap. Usually this daemon
   is not running at the time inetd is started.
The nfs daemon actually starts multiple daemons (it forks up to n servers
for "optimum" client support). Each server daemon may be servicing a
different client (or even the same client, different request). I have
seen performance improvements (NOT on a Linux server...) of one server
for each mount on each client (up to 18-25 servers).
These daemons must run all the time or performance will be REALLY bad. Each
connection may request ~ 8K bytes of data.
