Wrong.  If one filesystem is actively being used (eg. kernel
compile) and the other filesystem's cache isn't being used
(this one held the tarball of the kernel source) then the
cache which is being used actively should receive less
pressure than the cache which doesn't hold any active pages.
We really want to evict the kernel tarball from memory while
keeping the kernel source and object files resident.
This is exactly the reason why each filesystem cannot manage
its own cache ... it doesn't know anything about what the
system as a whole is doing.

Rik
