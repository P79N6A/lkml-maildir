You might also mention that I think the limits imposed by Linux are the 
only meaningful ones, as we would change our limits as soon as Linux 
did, and it was Linux that selected our limits for us.  We would have 
changed already if Linux didn't make it pointless to change it on Intel. 
 Reiser4 will have 64 bit blocknumbers that will be semi-pointless until 
64 bit CPUs are widely deployed, and I am simply guessing this will be 
not very far into reiser4's lifecycle.  Really, the couple of #defines 
that constitute these size limits, plus some surrounding code, are not 
such a big thing to change (except that it constitutes a disk format 
change).
