Subject: [PATCH 06/12] ide: limit legacy VLB host drivers to alpha, x86 and mips
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/2/16/142

These host drivers indirectly depend on CONFIG_IDE_ARCH_OBSOLETE_DEFAULTS=y
which is defined only on alpha, x86, ia64, m32r, mips and ppc32.
Moreover:
- on ia64 there is no ISA
- m32r is too new for VLB
- on ppc32 ISA is available only on PPC_CHRP (no default IDE ports)
  and PPC_PREP (marked as BROKEN)
[ the common sense tells me that VLB was only used on x86 but there
  are urban legends that one of these host drivers was needed on some
  other arch - thus the extra care ]
