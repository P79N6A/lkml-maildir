Yes, I actually do.  If userspace processes/users don't care about the 
memory/zone layout, they don't have to look.  But if they *do* care, 
they should be able to find out, and not be left in the proverbial dark. 
  Embedded systems will care, as will really large NUMA/Discontig 
systems.  As with some other patches, this functionality will not affect 
the average user on the average computer...  They are useful for really 
small systems, and really large systems, however.

The arch-specified 'cost' is also a good idea.  Some of the topology 
stuff I'm working on will allow that sort of interface as well.  And 
this patch does not 'depend' on userspace to do the right thing.  The 
patch does not alter the default VM behavior unless userspace 
*specifically* asks to alter it.
Cheers!
