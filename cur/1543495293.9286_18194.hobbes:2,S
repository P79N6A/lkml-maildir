	So, it seems that glibc 2.1 has some problems preventing knfsd
	and locking to work properly.
	Unfortunately, since it seems on the other side that glibc 2.0.7
	has trouble dealing with large netgroup NIS maps, causing kmountd
	to loop while checking authorisation in 60% of the cases, I am
	afraid that we have by now no reliable knfsd solution :-(
	It is really a pity, since knfsd proved to be much more efficient
	than unfsd (and we start a development project using a Linux NFS
	server in 2 weeks time).
	I just hope someone to prove that I am wrong !
