But you don't need magic vendor commands to read and write disk (or 
tape), you can do it with the base commands defined in SCSI-II. You only 
need filter lists for special cases where (a) you really do want vendor 
commands and (b) there's some reason to allow this to normal users.
I doubt that you need magic for any of the other obvious devices like 
SCSI scanners, ZIP and LS120 drives using ATA access rather than 
ide-floppy or ide-scsi, etc. I could be wrong on scanners, the setup 
commands may be more dangerous than I think.
To write CD unfortunately does seem to take more than I want the average 
user to do.
