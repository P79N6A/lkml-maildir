I believe our bootloader (Smon) initializes the MAC address.

Hm, good point.  I should figure out why read_eeprom isn't working and
fix that instead.  Maybe the driver should be changed to attempt to
read the MAC from the eeprom and then read from the registers if that
fails, instead of relying on flags.
By the way, the only other OS that runs on our hardware is VxWorks,
and possibly a few of the more obscure RTOS's...
