An error occurr when i tried to use proxy in kernel 2.4.18. When i tried to
reach some urls like 
http://www.itau.com.br
 or 
http://www.pactum.com.br
 the
request just didnt got the page.
I tried all possible compilations of kernel and it still didnt got it.
But changing the kernel to older versions like 2.4.7-10 or 2.2.20 it works,
without change any configuration of squid.
Please, take a look on this.
