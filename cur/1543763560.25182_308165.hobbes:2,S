Subject: [Patch] sched: remove unnecessary sched domains
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Appended patch removes the unnecessary scheduler domains(containing
only one sched group) setup during the sched-domain init.
For example on x86_64, we always have NUMA configured in. On Intel EM64T
systems, top most sched domain will be of NUMA and with only one sched_group in
it. 
With fork/exec balances(recent Nick's fixes in -mm tree), we always endup 
taking wrong decisions because of this topmost domain (as it contains only 
one group and find_idlest_group always returns NULL). We will endup loading 
HT package completely first, letting active load balance kickin and correct it.
In general, this patch also makes sense with out recent Nick's fixes
in -mm.
