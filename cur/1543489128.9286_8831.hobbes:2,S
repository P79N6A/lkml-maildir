Subject: FIOASYNC is (really!) broken in 2.2.1 (fwd)

 Hi, here's a msg concerning a bug in FIOASYNC that I had sent to 
Linus & Alan; I think it may be of interest to this list as well.
I checked 2.2.2, and it's still broken.
Now that O_SYNC is apparently implemented, it would be nice if you
guys fixed this: this way, I won't have to code around it for future
Linux versions (although it probably won't make much of a difference:
given the huge legacy of installed pre 2.2.3 Linux boxes, I have to code 
around it anyway.)  But for new ports/applications it will be important.
Plus, I wouldn't be surprised if some applications suddenly changed
their behavior, which is what happened to me with Kaffe (www.kaffe.org)
(You'll notice if your app suddenly starts to write synchronously to your
local disk.)
Note that I'm not subscribed to the linux-kernel mailing list;
if you want me to see replies, cc me.
Cheers,
	- Godmar
