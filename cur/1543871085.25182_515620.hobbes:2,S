But this still means I would need to decide between a PARAVIRT
kernel that either supports xen/VMI or cannot boot old user land without
weird options.  I don't think that's the correct solution. The goal
is a single binary that runs everywhere and is still compatible.
What would probably work is to somehow decide at runtime if a hypervisor
is there or not and then set vdso default based on that. I guess that
detection would be hypervisor specific though and probably would
need paravirt ops extensions.
