Subject: Has anyone run the Connectathon Testsuite recently?

I checked out kernel 2.4.9-6 from RedHat 7.1 updates. It failed the
Connectathon Testsuite against the Linux and none-Linux server. I
believe both NFS server and client are broken in 2.4.9-6. See
http://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=54868
Now the question is how bad the current Linus/AC kernels are?
