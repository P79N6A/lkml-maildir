It makes little sense, afaics, to have an interruptible sleep in
something like lockd_down() if you have no pid space or signal handling.
That isn't the only place where the process has to wait in an NFS
unmount, BTW. Things like rpc client cleanup (waiting for all the RPC
tasks to complete) also tend to lead to interruptible sleeps.
