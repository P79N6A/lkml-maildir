Don't bother: the base address in the struct netdevice is obsolete. I'll
turn it into 0xdead.

Ok (it looks like a 2 bytes offset though).

Ahem. It was not a great idea from me to convert from 31 to LPA_SLCT
as LPA_SLCT is intended to be a bitmask, not a register shift.

[and it works]
Cool. Ok, I take that and I'll sprinkle a few printks here and there.
Can you give a try at:
http://www.fr.zoreil.com/people/francois/misc/20050613-2.6.12-rc-sis190-test.patch
dmesg + ifconfig + tcpdump (please add a -e option) will be welcome as usual.
If the driver starts to behave in an usually better way, please issue
differently sized ping packets to cover the whole allowed range.
