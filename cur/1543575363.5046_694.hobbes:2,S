I agree, I've changed my mind about the use of a task gate for NMI - Intel
recommend an interrupt gate for a very good reason - NMI's are queued until
the IRET so using an interrup gate for NMI (and keeping interrupts
disabled) will guarantee that NMIs are handled serially.
I think our use of a trap gate for NMI in OS/2 was probably not the best
idea.

Nobody thinks that a stack overflow is recoverable - for that process.
By the time you overflow, the struct task at the bottom of the kernel
stack has been overwritten so the process is dead, gone to make its
maker, it is pushing up daisies.  The rest of the system may or may not
recover, depending on the resources that the dead process is still
holding and the links between processes.
Changing the stack overflow to a trap gate will give us diagnostics on
the failing task instead of an immediate triple fault and reboot.
Diagnostics are useful.  If the system can recover afterwards then that
is a bonus but it is not guaranteed.  The process is always unrecoverable.
I am not convinced that using a trap gate for NMI is a good idea, the
NMI watchdog kicks in too often for my liking.  Using a trap gate for a
debugger would be worthwhile, I have always been worried about the
amount of stack that kdb uses.
