Actually we can expect interoperability with SELinux on both ends. With
policy being the same on both ends it is completely valid to export a
secctx which is a user readable text representation of a label and be
able to use it on another selinux machine with the same policy. If I
have a RHEL4 and RHEL 5 box with different policies then it is the job
of the translation daemon to say I've gotten this label from this doi do
I have a mapping for it. If yes translate it into my doi. If not reject
it. This property is really no different from a user or group and I
don't see anyone suggesting we start storing those in xattrs instead of
recommended attrs.
You need to give me a specific example of why if I have policy A on both
ends on an SELinux box that a secctx isn't the same on both boxes.
