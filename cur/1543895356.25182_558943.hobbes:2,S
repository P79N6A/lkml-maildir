So, if a manufacturer used a ROM instead of a flash memory with the
intention to make software modifications impossible, then it is bad,
and when he did it for economical reasons, then it is a "natural barrier"?
Your tied-up-wings comparison is simply not valid. Or, more precisely,
you will usually not be able to tell whether you don't have wings or
if they're tied. Hardware design decisions of a manufacturer should
never be the subject of a software license.
