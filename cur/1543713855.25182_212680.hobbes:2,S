hey, I can add a sysctl in 5 minutes to disable pte_highmem at runtime,
why do you think it's expensive, it should be not, it's all atomic kmaps
only doing invlpg. The few workloads trashing on the ptes manipulation
needs pte_highmem anyways. If I thought it was expensive for any common
load the sysctl would be already there.
