That looks like a good solution. The question remains then: what does an
8042 'look like', as seen from Linux ? I want to mimic the ISA side of a
regular keyboard controller (without actually cramming a 40pin DIL chip on
my 7.5x10cm PCB :-P). Does anyone have pointers to documents on this ?
A semi-related question: is it possible for multiple different devices on
an ISA-ish bus to share an interrupt *on the processor side* ? For example,
say I have a custom PIC which multiplexes (logic OR) the interrupt output
of a keyboard controller with the interrupt output of an IDE controller
onto one interrupt line for the processor. Does this work, or do I break
any hidden assumptions in either the keyboard or the IDE driver ?
Sincerely,
JDB.
