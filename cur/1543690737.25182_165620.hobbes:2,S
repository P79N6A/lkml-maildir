I noticed this when my linker couldn't find ide_setup_dma() last night. 
It looks like most of the drivers/ide/pci/ drivers use ide_setup_dma() 
in their .init_dma() function. ide_setup_dma() is defined in 
drivers/ide/ide-dma.c, but it is only compiled if 
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEDMA_PCI is set. However, none of those PCI drivers 
express that dependency (I'm trying to use generic.c). What should be 
done here?
This is the full list of ide_setup_dma users:
aec62xx.c
