Subject: [PATCH] resume: wait for device probing to finish
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

From: Arjan van de Ven <arjan@linux.intel.com>
the resume code does not currently wait for device probing to finish.
Even without async function calls this is dicey and not correct,
but with async function calls during the boot sequence this is going
to get hit more...
This patch adds the synchronization using the newly introduced helper.
