Don't remember. I think Larry McVoy told the story, so I cc'ed
him ;-)

We have this kind of stuff all over the place. If we allocate
some small amount of memory and and need some small amount
associated with this memory, there is no problem with a little
waste.
Waste is better than fragmentation. This is the lesson people
learned from segments in the ia32.
Objects are easier to manage, if they are the same size.
