I have a PCI-E pro/1000 MT Quad Port adapter, which works quite well 
under 2.6.19.2 but fails to see link under 2.6.20-rc5. Earlier today I 
reported this to e1000-devel@lists.sf.net, but thought I should get the 
word out in case someone else is testing this kernel on this nic chipset.
Due to changes between 2.6.19.2 and 2.6.20, Intel driver 7.3.20 will not 
compile for 2.6.20, nor will the 2.6.19.2 in-tree driver.

 From what I've been able to gather, other Intel Pro/1000 chipsets work 
fine in 2.6.20-rc5. If the e1000 guys need any assistance testing, I'll 
be more than happy to volunteer myself as a guinea pig for patches.
