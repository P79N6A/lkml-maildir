i dont actually think that this is a problem i was reading an artical from
a website (cant find address now) which was stating that the promise 
card's fireware on the PDC20269 was limited by the firmware to 2 cards
and the 3rd did not work in other cases. The author had setup various 
other systems in the same way using other promise hardware but slightly 
different cards.
I have replaced the 3rd promise card with a highpoint card and everything 
is working fine and has been for the last 36 hours.
