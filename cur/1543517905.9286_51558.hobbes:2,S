You gave way not enough information to gave you wise answer (what version of
kernel you are using, what motherboard, what version of hdparm, etc, etc).
IBM-DJNA-371350 is just fine with Linux as it's what I'm using here right
now :-) I'm using kernel 2.2.10ac10 BTW ...

My kernel says:
    ide0: BM-DMA at 0xe000-0xe007, BIOS settings: hda:pio, hdb:pio
hda: IBM-DJNA-371350, ATA DISK drive
hda: IBM-DJNA-371350, 12949MB w/1966kB Cache, CHS=1650/255/63, UDMA

Here hdparm agree with kernel completely:
/dev/hda:
 Model=IBM-DJNA-371350, FwRev=J76OA30K, SerialNo=GM0GMGL2059
 Config={ HardSect NotMFM HdSw>15uSec Fixed DTR>10Mbs }
 RawCHS=26310/16/63, TrkSize=0, SectSize=0, ECCbytes=34
 BuffType=3(DualPortCache), BuffSize=1966kB, MaxMultSect=16, MultSect=off
 DblWordIO=no, maxPIO=2(fast), DMA=yes, maxDMA=2(fast)
 CurCHS=1650/255/63, CurSects=26520480, LBA=yes
 LBA CHS=825/510/63 Remapping, LBA=yes, LBAsects=26520480
 tDMA={min:120,rec:120}, DMA modes: mword0 mword1 mword2
 IORDY=on/off, tPIO={min:240,w/IORDY:120}, PIO modes: mode3 mode4
 UDMA modes: mode0 mode1 *mode2
BTW hdparm can not "disagree with kernel". It asks kernel and then shows
you what kernel returned. If you see there wrong information that means
that kernel later changed mind and now thinks that you have only 8BiG disk.

No big problem you say ???? Are you joking, right ? If kernel thinks that
there are just 8BiG it will use only 8BiG no matter what you'll do with
fdisk ! Till reboot at least.

Not know what you said fdisk but fdisk still thinks it's small (8GIB) disk.
/dev/hda is only 8GiB in size (1008*512*16383=8455200768 bytes).
Here is what my fdisk says:
Disk /dev/ide/hd/c0b0t0u0: 255 heads, 63 sectors, 1650 cylinders

Why you expecting 13BiG there ??? fdisk said you that you have partiton with
/dev/hda1 with 8257000 blocks... 8257000 is only 8BiG, not 13 ...

Try to do the following:
# dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/hda bs=512 count=1
Then reboot. This way you'll destroy partition table completely and kernel
will not try to use it to determine size of disk. When kernel sees partition
table on disk it thinks that correct information about disk is stored in that
partition table and information supplied by BIOS is incorrect. It looks
resonable (typical history: you put your disk in different system where
BIOS has different idea about disk geometry; but as long as there are correct
partiton table you can use your disk in that other system without problems)
but in your case it prevents you from seeing all disk: fdisk will use the same
information from partiton table to create new partitions. Even if you'll remove
all partitions and try to "start from scratch" ! Since information at that
point is already sucked from partition table to internal kernel structures
it'll be there till reboot !
