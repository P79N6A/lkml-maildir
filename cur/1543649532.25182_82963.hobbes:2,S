Modules make no difference to security. If I can add a module I can swap
the kernel and reboot the box, or I can patch the kernel. In fact I can
load modules into module-less kernels its just a bit harder.

It doesnt help you without a lot more than just fingerprints. You can
revoke module loading at boot time if you want - it only makes things a
little harder.
If you want to make it theoretically impossible then you need to load
the modules required early then revoke the module loading and rawio
capabilities. At that point I should not be able to get raw hardware
access or load a module. You need to revoke both of the so  I can't for
example hand load modules by poking in /dev/mem.
