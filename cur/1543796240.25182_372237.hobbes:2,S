Can you please clarify what you mean here? Better even if Mark describes 
what he does. The ideal situation would be if he posted a patch.

Well, most of the drivers will use that helpers I guess.
The thing however is that if you try to implement this in a "clean" way 
you will come to a sport of framework we've developed for memeory 
allocations, as I've saild previously.

I think they weren't.
The whole thing doesn't seem thought out nicely to me. The solution 
exists, of course, and that is -- do somthing similar to what we did there.

Not sure if I understood you. Can you please describe the situation when 
this prio inversion happens?
What priorities are you talking about? One controller is one thread, so 
it's _one_ priority, consequently there's nothing to invert.
As for your second statement, I don't argue. The fact however is that if 
you implement the mehtod which corrects priority inverstion problems 
your core will not be either so lightweight or so flexible. :)

It's not obvious that this price is high.
Anyway, it's a point I should agree with; this functionality better be a 
config option. Feel free to submit a patch, as you like to say.

Not sure if I understood you here, sorry.

Again, the policy can be overridden.
