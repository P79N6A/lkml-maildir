Profiling the kernel will tell.  Preferably with oprofile, but if for some
reason that doesn't work, with the old profiler.
I use this:
#!/bin/sh
sudo opcontrol --stop
sudo opcontrol --shutdown
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/oprofile
sudo opcontrol --vmlinux=/boot/vmlinux-$(uname -r)
sudo opcontrol --start-daemon
sudo opcontrol --start
time $@
sudo opcontrol --stop
sudo opcontrol --shutdown
sudo opreport -l /boot/vmlinux-$(uname -r) | head -50
I have seen PIO and MMIO operations on PCI busses take tremendous amounts
of time when that bus is saturated with DMA transfers.  But that was back
in the old days.
