Hi folks!
When I try to copy large files (let say some iso-image or disk image) over 
the network (regardless if nfs, ftp, whatever), the system starts to swap 
until it stucks - RESET required.
It is impossible for me to get one large 300MB file to my local harddrive!!
Observations I made: 
* No process seems to allocate the memory, buffered/cached memory is very 
low. So I assume that the kernel "eats" the memory.
* I tried my tests with a 100 MBit card (3c905) and a 10 MBit card (rtl-8029 
based), and it appeared only with the 100MBps card.
The kernel I'm using is a vanilla 2.4.5 with knfsd-patch (from namesys).
Thanks
	Alexander Puchmayr
