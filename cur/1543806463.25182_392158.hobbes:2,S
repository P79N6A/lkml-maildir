Subject: Purpose of MMC_DATA_MULTI?

I noticed that a new transfer flag was recently added to the MMC layer
without any immediate users, the MMC_DATA_MULTI flag. I'm guessing the
purpose of the flag is to indicate the difference between
MMC_READ_SINGLE_BLOCK and MMC_READ_MULTIPLE_BLOCKS with just one block.
If so, then that should probably be mentioned in a comment somewhere.
