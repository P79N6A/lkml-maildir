	It could be.  I'm going to try to boot off the Adaptec chip and 
see if that works.  It seems that the DAC960 doesn't allow Linux to mount 
the filesystem (no VFS... 'scream' message).  So it could be a DAC960 
driver issue?

	The thing is that this machine installed RH 7.2 perfectly.  We 
didn't use the 'apic' option to install.  After installation, the machine 
booted without any issues.  It wasn't until we tried 2.4.16 (and 2.4.14) 
that we ran into issues booting.

	Wow!  Was that a subtle slam?  I wonder which vendor you had in
mind?  ;)  I expect it's the same name that's on this 440GX+ box.
