It would be nice at some point to switch that to [u]intptr_t, before someone 
comes up with 128-bit machines (in other words, no rush whatsoever, but after 
seeing Sony build processors with 128-bit integer registers I'm willing to 
believe it's just a matter of time...)  The other thing about it is that it's 
nice to be explicit about the "pointer-sized integerness" of it all.

Indeed.
