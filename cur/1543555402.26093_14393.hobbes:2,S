uname -m tells me the hardware type of the machine. Is this determined while 
booting or is this the architecture I choose during 'make config'? 
Can't I run a i386 kernel on a ia64 machine? I know something like this from HP-
UX. You can choose between a 32 and a 64 bit kernel when installing, so knowing 
that you have a 64 bit capable machine does not say that you have a 64 bit 
kernel.
And I want to have the kernel bits, not the processor bits.
