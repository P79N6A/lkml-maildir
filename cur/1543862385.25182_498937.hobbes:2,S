My screwup - the chart I looked at managed to get the Core and Core2 series
mixed up. Here's a hopefully more canonical one:
http://www.intel.com/products/processor_number/proc_info_table.pdf
Does however list some Core2 that don't do virtualization (page 3, the
T5600 and T5500), which is what I think confused the author of the table
that I misread. ;)
