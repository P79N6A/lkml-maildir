Is there someway I can make use of a OS independent C++ code. This code has classes, new, delete etc.. My plan was to build a static library using the C++ code and then write a simple OS interface module which has the init, cleanup, read, write, ioctl etc but calls C++ functions in the library.
Is this scenario possible?

It's impossible.
