   [netdrvr sundance] bug fixes, VLAN support
   
       - Fix tx bugs in big-endian machines
       - Remove unused max_interrupt_work module parameter, the new 
         NAPI-like rx scheme doesn't need it.
       - Remove redundancy get_stats() in intr_handler(), those 
         I/O access could affect performance in ARM-based system
       - Add Linux software VLAN support
       - Fix bug of custom mac address 
       (StationAddr register only accept word write)

   [netdrvr via-rhine] fix promisc mode
   
   I found a via-rhine bug, it can't receive BPDU (mac: 0180c2000000)
   in promiscuous mode. 
   Fill all "1" in hash table to fix this problem in promiscuous mode.
   (RCR remain 0x1c, write it as 0x1f don't work)

   [wireless airo] make end-of-array test more portable
   
   FYI statsLabels[] is an array of char*, so the fix below
   is pretty obvious.
