there's another approach that could solve this problem: let the 
scheduler sort it all out. Esben Nielsen had this suggestion a couple of 
months ago - i didnt follow it because i thought that technique would 
create too many runnable tasks, but maybe that was a mistake. If we do 
the owning of the lock once the wakee hits the CPU we avoid the 'partial 
owner' problem, and we have the scheduler sort out priorities and 
policies.
but i think i like the 'partial owner' (or rather 'owner pending') 
technique a bit better, because it controls concurrency explicitly, and 
it would thus e.g. allow another trick: when a new owner 'steals' a lock 
from another in-flight task, then we could 'unwakeup' that in-flight 
thread which could thus avoid two more context-switches on e.g. SMP 
systems: hitting the CPU and immediately blocking on the lock. (But this 
is a second-phase optimization which needs some core scheduler magic as 
well, i guess i'll be the one to code it up.)
