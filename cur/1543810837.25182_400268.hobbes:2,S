Dear Arjan van de Ven,
Thanks for your answer.
I will remove CONFIG_SCSI_ARCMSR_MSI in next patch.
If Linux can not assurent the contingous memory space allocating of 
"dma_alloc_coherent" .
When arcmsr get a physical ccb address from areca's firmware.
Does linux has any functions for converting of  "bus to virtual" ?
Best Regards
Erich Chen
