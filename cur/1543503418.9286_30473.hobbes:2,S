Hi,
I think I found the problem but it's very strange and I don't know its meaning at all.
I described that sometimes my machine give opps at initializing my rtl8139 NIC and
after that a simple ping freezes the machine with a tons of kernel opps.
Now I discovered that it happens after system must check the filesystems with fsck.
It is strange beacuse even fsck did not find any problem (for example fsck because of
reaching the maximal mount count) the problem occures. But if there was not fsck
at the boot progress there is NO kernel opps at loading rtl8139 kernel module.
What can be the problem ? It's 2.2.10 UP, Debian 2.1 slink.
Thx, and sorry for weak English and other misstakes (I'm using a VERY slow ppp link
now, I don't want to reedit my mail now).
