Can you reproduce? If yes then it would be insteresting to know if you can
reproduce on 2.3.7_andrea1 as well (that has the new page cache btw). I
tested it hard also memory hog that goes out of memory on 2.3.7 (but not
with mem=12m :). No one problem so far. I have to think a bit about the
security issue I noticed in Ingo's patch though, but after all that is a
secondary issue.
