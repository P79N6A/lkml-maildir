this sounds like you're missing support for the tcp/udp match.
This functionality is implemented in xt_tcpudp.{c,ko}, which is compiled
as soon as x_tables is compiled.
What does cat /proc/netip_tables_matches show before and after executing
your iptables command, and before/after manually executing modprobe
xt_tcpudp.
Also, what is your iptables program version?
