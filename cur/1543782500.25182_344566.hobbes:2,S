The point is about ordering requirements that your "setup_thread_info(tsk, 
ti);" must be inbetween "*tsk = *orig;" and "tsk->thread_info = ti;", so 
that setup_thread_info() gets the right thread_info.

That in the sum it's still the same work.

ti6 is the sum of ti6_?, to make it easier to verify.

Most of them rather simple search and replace.

There has been a bit on IRC, but I can't really discuss such things on IRC 
(everyone just makes his own point and the issues continue and just scroll 
away) and it certainly didn't happen on the linux-m68k ml.

The biggest part is already at the end and I'll split the big one into 
three separate patches (stack, end_of_stack and task_thread_info changes). 
I'll send them to Andrew and we can still discuss how quickly to merge 
each part. I don't really see the point in holding off for too long, 
except for the final thread_info field removal.
