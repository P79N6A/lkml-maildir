I also found through some serious digging, a link off of linas.org, that
describes a way to change the source to allow up to 2GB.
http://humbolt.geo.uu.nl/Linux-MM/more_than_1GB.html
It doesn't specify if things get twitchy after this, but I'll have to assume
not until I am proven wrong.
I couldn't find one of the files specified under the 2.0.36 source, so I am
trying it out with 2.2.5
