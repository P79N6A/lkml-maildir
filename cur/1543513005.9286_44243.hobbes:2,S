There should be no FPU requirements in the kernel. The fact that
the kernel will not continue booting if a FPU is not found, but
FPU emulation has not been compiled in, is an artificial constraint
imposed by the initialization code.
The purpose of the FPU emulation is not to allow the machine to boot.
Instead, it is to allow floating-point instructions to be emulated. This
allows programs that use floating point operations to run without having
to be especially compiled against a 'C' floating-point emulator library
like M$DOS 'C' compilers.
