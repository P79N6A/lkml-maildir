I have written a simple block device driver in which i
m just displaying messages
in read & write part e.g " Device Reading .... " &  "
Device Writing .....".
I have succesfully loaded that module in memory using
"insmod" . 
& then use " mknod " command ...as   : 
                   mknod block_dev b 100 0 
  where , block_dev : name of device
                  b : as i m using block device driver
                100 : major number
                  0 : minor number
   
Even this is also working without error, now after
this command device "block_dev" is created (i have
checked it wit ls command ).
But , now while using "cat" & "echo" i am getting
error as :
       
       [root@localhost root]# cat block_dev
       cat: block_dev : No such device or address
       [root@localhost root]# echo "hello" > block_dev
       bash: block_dev : No such device or address
               
Is it ok to use 'b' in mknod command while working
with block device driver,
as i hav used (shown above).
Im attaching C-code also,so plz help me....if you have
another simple code for block device driver please
send me : shashank_pict@yahoo.com 
Please tell me what is going wrong in this code.....
