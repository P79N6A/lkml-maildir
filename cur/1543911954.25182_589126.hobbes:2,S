Subject: [2.6 patch] drivers/scsi/imm.c: fix check-after-use
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The Coverity checker spotted that we have already oops'ed if "cmd"
was NULL.
Since "cmd" being NULL doesn't seem to be possible at this point this 
patch removes the NULL check.
