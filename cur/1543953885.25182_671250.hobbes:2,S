I've been looking at zap_threads, I suspect we'll end up implementing a similar
loop, which makes me very uncomfortable. Adding code for the least possible
scenario. It will not get invoked for CLONE_THREAD, but will get invoked for the
case when CLONE_VM is set without CLONE_THREAD.
I'll try and experiment a bit more and see what I come up with
