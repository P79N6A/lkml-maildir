Funny.
The Used column is total-free, so free was 2^66 + 964440.
That 2^66 no doubt was 2^64 in a computation counting 4K-blocks,
and arose at some point where a negative number was considered unsigned.
But having available=1068904 larger than free=964440 is strange.
I assume this was produced by statfs or statfs64 or so.
You can check using "strace -e statfs64 df /dev/md4" that
these really are the values returned by the kernel,
so that we can partition the blame between df and the kernel.
The values are computed by
        buf->f_blocks = es->s_blocks_count - overhead;
        buf->f_bfree = ext3_count_free_blocks (sb);
        buf->f_bavail = buf->f_bfree - es->s_r_blocks_count;
that is: blocks = total - overhead, and available = free - reserved.
strace shows three values, and I expect tune2fs or so will show 2 more.
More available than free sounds like a negative count of reserved blocks.
Are you still able to examine the situation?
