Not really.  Having people who can dig through the obfuscation is also a 
must for enterprise class anything.
The desktop is where it's really crucial to have good documentation and 
ease of use.  The enterprise can afford to pay people who already knew 
it well, helped to develop it...  Grandma probably got Linux because she 
couldn't afford a new OS, or computer.
Of course, I won't go so far as to try to say "Linux should focus on 
this."  Linux should focus on whatever Linux developers feel like 
focusing on.
