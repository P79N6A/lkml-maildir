The problem is that, on some of the platforms that don't ignore
the argument, the code generation is much better.
GCC doesn't consider smp_processor_id() like some const local
variable, so multiple invocations are assumed to return different
values because in many cases 'current_thread_info()' is obscured.
Your patch is going to make a lot of new code get generated on
x86 for example, so I don't think it should be applied even though
my own platforms are not effected by this issue.
