Ok, you should have read this in the context of suspending/resuming from/to 
the normal kernel, and in that case they are exactly the same, i.e. kexec -e 
for suspend and kexec -j for resume.
BTW, it would be really helpful if people would actually try the kexec 
hibernation patches, as this may yield a much more constructive discussion.
Thanks!
