That _seems_ reasonable.  But what do subsystem drivers expect?  They
might assume that the binding succeeded whenever the registration 
succeeded.  Although it may not make any real difference in the end.
And of course, we always have the excuse that up until a week ago, failure
to create the symlinks would not cause device registration to fail...
