This is a known bug in the isdn driver. They use a >64K array for their
device structures. The easy fix is to just replace the kmalloc with a 
vmalloc() [the better fix would be to use a array of pointers and allocate
the device structures only when needed]. These are just internal structures
that are never touched by hardware, so vmalloc is fine.
I believe Karsten has fixed it in the latest I4L Tree.
