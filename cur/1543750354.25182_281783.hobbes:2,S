> HOW does the Gred schedule packets of differnet priorities?
The packets are all enqueued onto the same queue. Gred is not
about prioritizing but only about dropping, hence once the packet
is enqueued it doesn't make sense to differ anymore. The difference
to normal red is that one can use separate red calculation
parameters per tcindex flow. tcindex is usually set via dsmark/
tcindex with contents of the dscp field. You might want to use a
more aggressive set of parameters for your bulk flows and treat
your interactive flows with more respect.
