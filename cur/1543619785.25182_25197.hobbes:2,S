Andrew did supply a patch for Riel but he did not accept all of it?
Lets see again. Do I understand you correctly:
rmap 11c fixes the problem #1 but not 11b? are all later
rmaps good?
rmap 11c:
  - oom_kill race locking fix                             (Andres Salomon)
  - elevator improvement                                  (Andrew Morton)
  - dirty buffer writeout speedup (hopefully ;))          (me)
  - small documentation updates                           (me)
  - page_launder() never does synchronous IO, kswapd
    and the processes calling it sleep on higher level    (me)
  - deadlock fix in touch_page()                          (me)
rmap 11b:
Lets see, not oom condition, no dirty buffers (read "only"),
not documentation, page_launder (no dirty...), not deadlock.
Remaining is the elevator... And that can really be it!
(read ahead related too...)
and 2.4.18-pre2 (or later) does not fix it?
2.4.18-pre2:
- ...
- Fix elevator insertion point on failed
  request merge					(Jens Axboe)
- ...
pre1:
