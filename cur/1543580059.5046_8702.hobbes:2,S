I have a PCI -> PCMCIA bridge + lucent wavelan card working fine with the
GPL driver (not the Lucent proprietory one) and 2.4. From memory all I had
to do was stop pcmcia-cs from using the lower io port range (there must
have been conflicts with existing devices).
#include port 0x100-0x4ff, port 0x800-0x8ff, port 0xc00-0xcff
include port 0x800-0x8ff, port 0xc00-0xcff
