Even with all this he's going to have trouble since his buffer is in
kernel space and the read is going to expect it to be in user-context...
Reading and writing files from within the kernel is almost never a good
idea and has been made difficult by design.  He should look at what
he is trying to do and perhaps look for another interface, such as
use of ioctls, proc, seq_file, etc..  He probably doesn't need to
do this I/O from within the kernel and should rethink it.
