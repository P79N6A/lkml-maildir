I agree too.

Completely unreadable. What do you think you might gain this way? I doesn't
matter in which order the par[i] are set to zero, does it?
Please stick to plain, down-to-earth, colloquial C unless there is a
/measurable/ advantage in not doing so, and it matters overall (i.e., the
code in question runs many times a second). Readability first, traded in
for efficiency only when it /really/ matters. Given today's gcc, you'll
probably just confuse it into generating bad code by using cute tricks, as
it has been tuned to the typical language usage. And gcc is a moving
target, what might be a good idea today could be the worst possible thing
to do in a year or so (or even today with a different architecture).
