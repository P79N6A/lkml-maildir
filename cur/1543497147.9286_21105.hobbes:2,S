EEK!  I apologize for this, I was very delerious when I wrote the previous
message and patch (no, don't apply it! :) and was trying to find something that
could cause corruption.  I finally tracked it to an egcs bug.  So I highly
recommend against not making NTFS with egcs 1.1.2, because it will corrupt data
and possibly the kernel structures. gcc 2.7.2 works fine.  I'm unsure of other
compilers at the present moment....
Sorry,
