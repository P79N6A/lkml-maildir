Fair enough, I see your point. How would you suggest we handle the latency
thing, though?
I'm not against making the elevator more intelligent, and you have a
good argument. But I've very much against "allow the queues to grow with
no sense of latency".

Good catch, I bet you're right.

At least historically (and I think it's still true in some cases),
kupdated was also in charge of trying to write out buffers under
low-memory circumstances. And without any throttling, blind writing can
make things worse.
However, the request throttle should be _plenty_ good enough, so I think
you're right.
Oh, one issue in case you're going to work on this: kupdated does need to
do the "wait_for_locked_buffers()" at some point, as that is also what
moves buffers from the locked list to the clean list. But that has nothing
to do with the fdatawait thing.
