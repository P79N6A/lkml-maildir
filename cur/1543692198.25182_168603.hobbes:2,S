as wrote in a later email, technically the dynamic solution obsoletes
the static one, but only as far as the kernel is concerned.
It happens that to enable the dynamic solution you've to change 1 line
to lilo.conf/grub.lst. since 2.4 is already being used in production
distributed scenarios, there is at least a psycology value in providing
a static solution that doesn't involve lilo.conf changes, so people can
deploy the feature without having to edit conf files at all (with grub
they don't need to run lilo either).
So I will rewrite my patch in a way that doesn't reject the static
setting for next -aa (together with some other tons of pending things,
but the vm merge is already completed on my tree, so I'm in sync again
with pre5 on that side and that was top priority to fixup to be sure
nothing was missing, thanks for merging the watermarks already btw ;).
