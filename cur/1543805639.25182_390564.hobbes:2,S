I will gladly test your fork on my various hardware here.  I have a  
desktop with Apple CD/RW+DVDROM and generic DVD+/-RW DL drive, and a  
laptop with Apple DVD+/-RW drive.  Just send or post patches  
somewhere and I'll take a look.  I suggest starting by looking at  
some of the various distro patches, IIRC some of them have already  
make significant cleanups.

Might I suggest quilt or stgit?  Both allow you to maintain an  
unstable and highly variable stack of patches based off a more stable  
branch, from which some patches percolate down into stable occasionally.
Good luck with this!
