I sugggest (1) the plethora of drivers in the source, and (2)
Alessando Rubini's Linux Device Drivers, published by ORA.
> 1. What is the correct way to do a generic thread yield?
Assuming a __kernel__ thread yield, schedule() is correct.
void semTake(SEM_ID psem, int timeout)
{
// Note no timeout provision....
    int i=0;
    if (verbosity > 15) printk(" semTake %x\n", *psem);
    while (*psem == _T_SEM_EMPTY )
    {
        schedule();        // note: using sleep_on is a better
possibility...

static struct  wait_queue    *data_wait_queue = NULL;
interruptible_sleep_on(&data_wait_queue);
wake_up_interruptible(&data_wait_queue);
> 3. What is the right way to determine the number of blocks...
I've only done network drivers.  I stay away from block thingys.
