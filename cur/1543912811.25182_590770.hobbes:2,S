They indeed don't clash,
the cpp included by gcc is intelligent enough, it know the
function-style definition of max in kernel.h, that's different from
the auto variable max here, so they don't clash with each other,
But I think the variable name "max" here is ambiguous, I changed it to
"limit", see my following patch [PATCH 2/3].
