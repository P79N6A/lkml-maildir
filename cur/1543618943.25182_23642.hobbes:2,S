Yes, but not for benchmarks.  It has value only as a stability test - while 
it may in some cases provide some general indication of performance, its 
variance is far too large, even under controlled conditions, for it to have 
any value as a benchmark.  I'm surprised you'd even suggest this.
Andrea, please, if we want good benchmarks let's at least be clear on what 
tools benchmarkers should/should not be using.

No, this is not the only problem.  DBench is just plain *flaky*.  You don't
appear to be clear on why.  In short, dbench has two main flaws:
  - It's extremely sensitive to scheduling.  If one process happens to make
    progress then it gets more heavily cached and its progress becomes even
    greater.  The benchmark completes much more quickly in this case, whereas
    if all processes progress at nearly the same rate (by chance) it runs
    more slowly.
  - It can happen (again by chance) that dbench files get deleted while still
    in cache, and this process completes in a fraction of the time that real 
    disk IO would require.
I've seen successsive runs of dbench *under identical conditions* (that is, 
from a clean reboot etc.) vary by as much as 30%.  Others report even greater 
variance.  Can we please agree that dbench is useless for benchmarks?
