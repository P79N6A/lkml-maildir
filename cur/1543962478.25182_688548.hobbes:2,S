Daniel has done a port, but I think it dropped some archs so its not
complete.

and updates, possibly:
ftp://source.mvista.com/pub/dwalker/rt/
His bi-sectability changes are pretty key, and I would like to see those
reviewed and incorporated, even if they apply only to x86.
The RT patch queue generally is a mess today. 
Lots of stuff needs to be folded down into the core patches.
The ins and outs of the softirq code need major clean-up.
There are big issues around apic / hardirq threads that we need to
tackle at multiple levels.
(we are seeing the semis acknowledge the IRQ thread model, where IRQs
may stay masked longer than usual)
per-device irq threads, as Jon Masters has mentioned in his blog, may be
one work-around to get past the legacy stuff in x86.
and with the x86 merge, all this should become easier, so that hopefully
we can extricate the IRQ threads changes in a bisectable way, so we can
address the technical issues that stand in the way of upstream, apart
from PREEMPT_RT.
