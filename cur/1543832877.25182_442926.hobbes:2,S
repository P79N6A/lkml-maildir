Subject: [PATCH -mm 0/7] execns syscall and user namespace

Hello !
The following patchset adds the user namespace and a new syscall execns.
The user namespace will allow a process to unshare its user_struct table,
resetting at the same time its own user_struct and all the associated
accounting.
The purpose of execns is to make sure that a process unsharing a namespace
is free from any reference in the previous namespace. the execve() semantic
seems to be the best candidate as it already flushes the previous process
context.
Thanks for reviewing, sharing, flaming !
C.
