Hello,
I'm finished most of the implementation of the ext2 online resize (kernel
patch + user-space tools), but I'm consistently having a problem somewhere
in the kernel (2.0.37) that I'm having a problem tracking down.
The kernel performs the requisite action as normal, and the debugging
shows that it is reading the correct data from the disk, and it updates
the superblock and group descriptors in the buffer, but it seemingly
"forgets" these changes to the superblock and GDT within a few seconds
(at least by the time I type "df -k" it is gone.
The reason I think it is a kernel problem of some sort is that for some
small resizes, all I call is ext2_free_blocks(), which does it's job and
all along the code path back from ext2_remount() the data is correct.
After it goes outside the ext2 code, the data is lost.  I DO mark the
superblock dirty via:
sb->s_dirt=1; mark_buffer_dirty(sb->u.ext2_sb.s_sbh, 1);
so my understanding is that this would cause any changes made by the kernel
to be written to disk, but in fact old data is being written to disk on top
of data that I had verified was there.  I thought that there was a unified
cache between the kernel and user-space, is this not the case?  If not, where
is the other copy of the superblock and GDT block so I can update it as well?
Cheers, Andreas
