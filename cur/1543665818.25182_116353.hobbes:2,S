The other problem, of course, is that this would essentially mean that a
user-space application has a lock that prevents other processes (even the
kernel) from doing anything.  At best we have to worry about an application
going sour, and at worst it is a DOS hole as Helge says.
How about something like:
	death:
		for each directory
			while readdir(directory, large_buffer)
				if (directory)
					run death(directory)
			readdir(directory, small_buffer)
		sleep forever
The first getdents walks recursively down to the leaves, and then does a
single getdents with enough space to hold a single dirent, locking the
directory, but then never progressing.  It also does the single-dirent
getdents on the way up the tree.  Now, everything is locked out of the
entire directory tree.
Cheers, Andreas
