The randomization is not for cache coloring, but for security purposes
(except for the old very small stack randomization that was used
to avoid conflicts on HyperThreaded CPUs). I would be surprised if the
mmap made much difference because it's page aligned and at least
on x86 the L2 and larger caches are usually PI.

They need the same alignment and with the random bits in there it's unlikely
to be ever the same.
