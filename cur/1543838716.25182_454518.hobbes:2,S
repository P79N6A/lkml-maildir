I seem to be having a multi-hour delay for email delivery, so maybe
we've crossed emails.
A "low watermark interrupt" is an interrupt that is generated when
some queue is "almost empty". This last set of patches implement this
for the TX queue. The interrupt pops when 3/4ths of the packets 
in the queue have been processed.  Playing with ths setting
(3/4ths or some other number) seemed to make little difference.

The nature of a low-watermark interrupt is that it NEVER pops, as long
as the kernel keeps putting more stuff into the queue, so as to keep 
the queue at least 1/4'th full. I don't know how to mitigate interrupts 
more than that.
