The pid/owner checking at setup time is very broken anyways. Consider a 
threaded application that wants to set up SIGIO from one thread but receive
from another. It has to be root currently to do that.
Best would be to never check anything in F_SETOWN, but just save the 
uid/pid/gid and always check at signal sending time. 
[in addition sk->proc should go and use the fasync list, but that is a 
different thing for now]
