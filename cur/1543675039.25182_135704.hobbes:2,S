CONFIG_NR_CPUS should appear under the processor type and features menu.
I fixed sparse physical APIC ID wakeup, so setting it to 2 should be
fine now. If the configurator is hiding it from you, please contact
Roman Zippel, and in the meantime vi .config and search for NR_CPUS and
set that to the desired value. AFAIK the option is visible, but I've
not got unusual configs.

make oldconfig is not meant for those in need of explanations. It's
barely meant to be interactive if at all. menuconfig might be a better
configuration method for you.
