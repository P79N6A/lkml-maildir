I receive a lot of complaints when JFS does not accept names because
they contain an "invalid" character.  Defaulting to UTF-8 will cause
some non-utf-8 filenames to be rejected.  The change I made makes the
default behavior sane and posix-compliant.  It won't make everybody
happy, but it will provide predicable, sane behavior.

The biggest problem with changing the default now is that the behavior
was unpredictable before.  Now, the default behavior will not allow
filenames to be stored with UCS-2 characters greater than 0x00ff, so
there won't be inaccessible files unless the iocharset option has been
used.  This allows the average user to get sane behavior, but allows the
flexibility of accessing the file system in a specific character set for
those users who know what they are doing.
