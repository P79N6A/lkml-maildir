sata_sx4 operates through [standard PC] memory on the card, and you use 
a DMA engine to copy memory to/from the card.
[select chipsets supported by] sata_promise operates directly on host 
memory.
So, while sata_sx4 is farther away from your direct-host-memory model, 
it also has much more potential for RAID acceleration:  ideally, RAID1 
just copies data to the card once, then copies the data to multiple 
drives from there.  Similarly with RAID5, you can eliminate copies and 
offload XOR, presuming the drives are all connected to the same card.
