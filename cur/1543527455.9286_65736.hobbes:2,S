Subject: [PATCH] [Fixed] Re: Softnet/eepro100 driver conversion bug in 2.3.43pre8?
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

After fiddling around in speedo_start_xmit with moving the spin_unlock()
around, I figured out a way to fix the timeout problems I was seeing on
2.3 ever since the softnet merge.  Andi Kleen then noticed the actual
problem and pointed out the correct way to fix it.  Attached is a patch
that works perfectly for me for fixing the timeouts with the eepro100.
Previously, I could run "ping -s 3000 -f foo" and see a timeout within a
second or two; now, I have yet to see a timeout.  The driver still oopses
on rmmod, but that's been happening for a while now.
Patch against 2.3.48pre1.
