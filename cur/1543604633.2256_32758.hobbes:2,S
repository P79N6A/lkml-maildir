Wouldn't just counting the lines in /proc/net/tcp be sufficient to see
how many buckets should be used in an ideal hash table distribution
scenario?  (In which case the size of the hash table depends largely on a
machine's work load...)
Most of our web servers seem to have 500-1000 entries in /proc/net/tcp.
