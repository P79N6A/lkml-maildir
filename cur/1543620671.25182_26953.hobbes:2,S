The culprit hiding inode zero is now found.
Rogier Wolff wrote a new tiny ls version using man 3 readdir, provided by 
glibc and this does not show inode zero.
I rewrote that to use man 2 readdir and it now shows inode zero. (I also 
tried man 2 getdents, which gives the same result, i.e. inode zero is shown.)
So glibc is for some reason hiding inode zero from us...
Would the glibc developers care to comment?
Best regards,
Anton
