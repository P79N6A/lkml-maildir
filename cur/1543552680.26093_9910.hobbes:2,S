Kqueue's flexibility could allow this to be implemented, all you
would need to do is make a new filter trigger.  You might need
a _bit_ of hackery to make sure those aren't removed, or one
could just add the event after clearing all pending events.
Adding a filter to be informed when a specific fd is closed is
certainly an option, it doesn't make very much sense because that
fd could then be reused quickly by something else...
but anyhow:
The point of this interface is to ask kqueue to report only on the
things you are interested in, not to generate superfluous that you
wouldn't care about.  You could make such a flag if Linux adopted
this interface and I'm sure we'd be forced to adopt it, but if you
make kqueue generate info an application won't care about I don't
think that would be taken back.
