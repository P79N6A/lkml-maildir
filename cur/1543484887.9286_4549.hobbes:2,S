Naaah, don't despair,
have a look at 
http://www.kernel.org/mirrors/
The page says that connecting to
ftp.XX.kernel.org or www.XX.kernel.org 
via ftp or http, respectively, is the official way to go, where XX is
the two-letter code for your country.
 All _official_ kernel mirror sites (LKAMS == Linux Kernel Archive
Mirror System) sync' with kernel.org very soon after a new file
arrives in the tree. Thanks to Peter Anvin who made it possible.
The pre-kernel patches lie in the /pub/linux/kernel/testing directory.
