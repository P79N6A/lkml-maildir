The current (I can't speak to what Alan Cox is going to change) rules
with tty drivers is that tty drivers are supposed to close the line
discpline in their close routines.  That's the much safer and cleaner
way of fixing this problem, and it is in line with what most of the
other tty drivers are doing.
