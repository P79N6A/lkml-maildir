s/can// and I would. s/uni-processor// additionally and I'd assure you it's

Which is also approximately the same timeframe in which one might consider 
currently developped kernels obsolete for deployment by the way...

But why? First, look at the number of #ifdef CONFIG_SMP in the scheduler 
code -- the Linux kernel already has seperate UP/SMP schedulers selected 
through CONFIG_SMP. Embedded can certainly use its own !CONFIG_SMP kernels, 
for Linux servers SMP is the norm today and for the desktop/home, SMP 
probably already _also_ is the norm today, what with multi-core and HT 
(which needs different things than real SMP does, but is also certainly not 
UP). And if it isn't, it will be tomorrow and stay that way for the 
forseeable future.

To what? I don't understand this comment. You are optimizing for the case of 
a dead CPU? Why would the user care if he'd be running the most optimal 
scheduler for the situation when his box is limping along anyway?
