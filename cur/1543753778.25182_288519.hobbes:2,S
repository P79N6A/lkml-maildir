We have no reason to suspect bugs there; if there were any,
lots of things would have been breaking for a long time now.

Actually it'd be more like dev_is_root_hub(dev, bus), since
both values are readily at hand -- you're basically just
wanting to wrap "dev == hcd->self.root_hub" in most cases.
Though I'm still not clear why you'd want to change that
working code; nothing's broken now, after all.
By the way ... on the topic of usbmon rather than changing
usbcore, is there a brief writeup of what you want this
new version to be doing -- and how?  Like, why put the
spy hooks in that location, rather than any of the other
choices.  (Many of them would be less surprising to me!)
