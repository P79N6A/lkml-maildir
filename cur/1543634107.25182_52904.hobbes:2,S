Making the AGP Aperture write-back cacheable is not good from
a performance perspective. (I can't comment on which is better 
from a Linux Kernel perspective).
An Aperture Page can be made
cache-coherent depending on the implementation
and the AGP 3.0 spec provides an
architectural way of specifying and controlling these as
well.  But, by default the area is not made cache-coherent
due to the performance loss and the lack of software to take
advantage of it -- the two play off against each
other. 
Making it cache-coherent causes every AGP access to
snoop processor caches and this can be quite a hit in
performance when you consider the predominant AGP software
model. Most software that takes advantage of AGP is still
using the old Intel model of uncacheable, the majority of
data placed in the Aperture are read-only structures for the
AGP device -- such as vertex lists, locked vertex arrays,
and texture data. For the most part this fits the current
paradigm of throwing textures and vertices at the graphics
device. The only graphics area found so far that could
benefit from a coherent aperture is video capture data which
streams in from the graphics device and requires CPU
post-processing.
