Please do not force users to report X times the same bug in different places. 
This will only lead to lost information since people won't drag the whole 
problem history each time. OTOH at least the initial stage of bug submissions 
should be cc'd to the relevant lists, so that interested people can get on the 
problems. This is what apache does (with big fat warnings to not reply to the 
mail but fire bugzilla instead) and it seems to work well.
