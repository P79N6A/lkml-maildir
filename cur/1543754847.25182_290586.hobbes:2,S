Hmmm, I recall e100 working fine on a Radisys ENP-2611, which has a
IXP2400 (xscale) in big-endian mode, running 2.6.  This particular
board had its root fs NFS-mounted and pumped several hundreds of
gigabytes through the NIC during a period of at least a few months,
and I never saw any problems.
Something tells me that the next time I try it, it won't work at all.
