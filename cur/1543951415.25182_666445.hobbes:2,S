Subject: [PATCH] aio_write should tell userspace about partial writes
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/3/11/393

[ Linus, please apply.  This patch was discussed and acked before,
  but somehow got lost. ]
When an AIO write gets a non-retry error after writing some data
(eg. ENOSPC), it should return the amount written already, not the
error.  Just like write() is supposed to.
This was found by the libaio test suite.
