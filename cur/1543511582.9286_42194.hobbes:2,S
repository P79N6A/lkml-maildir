That script should probably test for existance of zImage as well, as some
people /might/ still use vmlinuz. I doubt it, but hey, it's only a couple
more lines.
Anybody have thoughts on making something like this platform-generic and
stuffing it into the Makefile as 'make hacker_install'? I can see it being
quite useful for people working on drivers for multiple kernel versions.
Keith, if you don't want to take care of this thing, let me know, i'll
probably be willing to pick it up (one must start somewhere in the
kernel).
We probably ought to make sure it doesn't rely on GNU extensions to keep
David Parsons happy, as well ;^)
