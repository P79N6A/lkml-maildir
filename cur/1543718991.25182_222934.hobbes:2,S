Hi,
I think I had the same problem on a PIIX SATA with RAID1. Basically, I noticed
that each disk could be accessed one at a time, and that it was totally
impossible to access the second one while the first one was reading. A simple
"cat /dev/sda >/dev/null" prevented anyone from logging into the box or doing
anything which required disk I/O.
So if you have the same problem, I can fairly understand your low numbers.
Could you try something like :
# cat /dev/sda >/dev/null &
# hdparm -t /dev/sdb
If hdparm doesn't start before the 'cat' ends, you do have the same problem.
Well, I don't know where it comes from, and unfortunately I don't have the
machine anymore to try fixes.
Regards,
Willy
