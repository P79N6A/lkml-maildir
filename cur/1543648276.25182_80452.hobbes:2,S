 I'm not sure if you can lock a MIPS system into the 32-bit mode at all,
certainly not the processor -- it always runs with 64-bit operations
enabled when in the kernel mode (for the user and supervisor modes it's
selectable), though you may disable 64-bit addressing.  A system may be
incapable of 64-bit operation if its system controller doesn't support
doubleword transfers on the host bus, but I'm not sure if it's possible to
force an R4k CPU to only use 32-bit transfers for cache fills and
writebacks.  Probably not.  So that's really the matter of software only.
