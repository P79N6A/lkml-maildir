Mmmm. The fundamental problem I think we ran across (just whilst pondering,
not in code) was that some things (eg ... init) are bound to ALL cpus (or
no cpus, depending how you word it); i.e. they're created before the cpusets
are, and are a member of the grand-top-level-uber-master-thingummy.
How do you service such processes? That's what I meant by the exclusive
domains aren't really exclusive. 
Perhaps Matt can recall the problems better. I really liked his idea, aside
from the small problem that it didn't seem to work ;-)

But that's the problem ... I think there are *always* cpusets that overlap.
Which is sad (fixable?) because it breaks lots of intelligent things we
could do.

That's OK, so have most of the rest of us, so even if you could remember,
it wouldn't help much ;-)
