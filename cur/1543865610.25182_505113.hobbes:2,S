Hello,
Is there a mailing list and/or a website tracing the development of the 
tifm_* drivers?  I've got a new Vaio that has this chipset for its SD 
card reader and would like to track this driver development (and maybe 
help with its development).
Google hasn't been too helpful on this (though the 0.7 patch against 
kernel 2.6.19 made things much better - though not perfect).
Please CC me on any replies, I'm not on this list.
Thanks,
--
