Would've been nice to have heard about this lockdep problem. Anyway,
thanks for tackling it.
How about moving this bit:
+#ifndef ARCH_HAS_EARLY_ALLOC
+#define LARGEVAR(x,y) { static typeof(*x) __ ## x[y];  x = __ ## x; }
+#else
+#define LARGEVAR(x,y) x = arch_early_alloc(sizeof(*x) * y)
+#endif
out of the lockdep code and into the generic early alloc code?
