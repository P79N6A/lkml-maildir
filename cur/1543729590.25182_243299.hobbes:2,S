Neat, this looks pretty good.  Other comments on the pkt driver (not related
to this patch):
in the blockdev ->open/->release->ioctl you can get your private data
from inode->i_bdev->bd_disk->private_data instead of doing the lookup.
You still have a little to much dev_t handling in your driver for my
taste, I'm going to take a look soon.
