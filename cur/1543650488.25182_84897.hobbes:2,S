Subject: Usage of ORBZ.ORG  is bad for your email...
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2002/10/30/145

A typical example:
  Diagnostic Code:
      smtp; 554 (Service unavailable; [209.116.70.75] blocked using
	inputs.orbz.org, reason: Mail rejected because the server you
	are sending to is misconfigured.)
The sad part is, NOBODY will be able to send to people using those
blocking lists, which now appear to contain poison.
