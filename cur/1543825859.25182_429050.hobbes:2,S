Ok. Given the fast switchover requirement, may be it makes sense to generate 
panic events before switching to new kernel. Though it will be a compromise
on kdump's reliability and now its success will be dependent on how well 
behaved the notifier callback is.
Why to create a separate list crash_notifier_list? What's the difference
between a panic_notifier and crash_notifier. To me both are same. Basically
kernel is going down and if some subsystem wants to take some minimal
action, he can do it now. But he got to remember that he is running from
inside panic and he should not depend too much on kernel data structures
as these might be corrupted.
At the same time the notifier got to remember that there are other folks
waiting in the queue so he needs to return ASAP. I see some code in 
powerpc where panic notifier call seems to be jumping to firmware and 
bring the system down. We shall have to fix such calls to see if crash
dump kernel is loaded then don't jump to firmware.
Thanks
