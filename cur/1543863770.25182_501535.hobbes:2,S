I agree. 
My current concerns is not adding knobs but how to show/explain
what the users does. In most case, users don't know what they does
and believes system-information can tell that.
for example)
A user sometimes asks "why amount of system-A's pagecache and system-B's are
different from each other ?. I definitly does the same jobs on the both system."
...just because he used different deta-set ;)
Thanks,
