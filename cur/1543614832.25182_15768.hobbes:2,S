We love the "blame" (aka annotate) feature and took it to a new level.
As an old coworker once said of SCM: "You can run, but you can't hide" :-)
We give you every possible variation of annotate in BK.  You can see the
annotated listing of any version of a file, and you construct arbitrary
versions of files.  The most useful one [1] is "show me the annotated
listing of all lines that have ever been in any version of this file".
You can also grep for stuff in the revision history.  From the man page [2]:
       To see if <pattern> occurs anywhere in any version of  any
       file of your tree:
           $ bk -r grep -R pattern
       To see if it occurs anywhere in the most recent version of
       of any file of your tree:
           $ bk -r grep pattern
       To see if it was added by the most recent delta made in of
       any file of your tree:
           $ bk -r grep -R+ pattern
