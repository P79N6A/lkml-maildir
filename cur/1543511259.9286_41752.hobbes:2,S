Hello...
2.2.12+ikd and 2.2.13pre14+ikd are both exhibitting some *BAD*
behaviour on my system.  I've run memtest86 for umteen passes, etc..
I'm pretty sure this one is a real bug.
Here's what I know.
# cd /usr/src/linux
# make bzImage
......
......
weird syntax error from the compiler after some time.
# less (source file that compiler pukes on)
  File has strange corrupt characters in it.  Usually, exactly 2.
  Hmmm.... HD transfer problem?
  In this case, the file was include/linux/sched.h line 517
# cp include/linux/sched.h /tmp
# shutdown -r now
After reboot:
# diff include/linux/sched.h /tmp
517c517
< extern int do_sigaltstack(const stack_t *ss, stack_t *oss, unsigned long sp);
---
> extern int do_sigaltstack(const stack_ö *ss, sDack_t *Mss, unsIgned long sp);
As you can see, exactly two bytes were corrupt in the bufferred version
of the file, and thus copied to the file in /tmp, but the original ON DISK
version of the file is fine.  Something rotten in China.
That's all I know for now.  I'll be gone for the weekend, so hopefully
this is all the info you need.  Just wanted to report it as soon as possible.
Later
