No, the term context here has a specific meaning.  It refers to those 
things which flow from the current pointer, including the virtual memory 
space, file descriptor table, current uid, and so forth.  Because the 
current pointer is not changed on entry to an ISR, the ISR is executing 
in the context of the interrupted process, and thus uses that process' 
virtual memory, etc.
