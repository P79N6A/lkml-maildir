hi all,
thanks for the feedback! i'll try all those recommendations now. by the
way i tried reiserfsck --check /dev/hda2, etc.... and it seems that
everything is ok... i suspect it's either the power supply or the
cooling... power supply because, i've got a 300W one but, almost all the
jumper power cables are used... i've got 2 chassis fans one for ducting
are out at the back below the power supply and one in front to drive the
air in.. i've separated my hard drives now they're not on top of each
other anymore... i'll try connecting the other hdisk to another power
cable and try if it does work.... i'll give apmd a go as well...
thanks guys!
btw, this is my real email address now Mike... cheers!
