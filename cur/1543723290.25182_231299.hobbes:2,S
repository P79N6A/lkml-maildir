I get a similar problem on my Presario laptop.  In my case "all of a
suddend" hda3 becomes write-only.  Next time it happens I'll see if I
can capture a dmesg log or something.  It only seems to happen when I
enable my wifi and do a lot of disk activity [but only once in a
while].  Could be that my wifi and IDE0 share an IRQ?
Of course I'm more apt to blame my laptop than Linux since the same
kernel [well diff build options but you know what I mean] works just
fine on my two desktops in the house...
