Michael Chan at Broadcom spotted the bug.
Things are totally broken if the switch/hub does not support
autonegotiation.  Checking for the MAC_STATUS_SIGNAL_DET bit
in the tg3 polling timer fixes the problem.
This is probably why it worked for you and doesn't with the
IBM blades as blades are more likely to be connected to
non-autoneg'ing devices.
