I dunno about programmes breaking, but I can definately say that
making hardlinks to files in other directories (not owned by the
linking user) is a handy feature. Sure, in some (hostile) environments
you might want to restrict hard links, but in other environments it's
really handy. Symlinks aren't always the answer.
