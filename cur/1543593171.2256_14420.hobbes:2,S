Actually, I'm running this board with MPS 1.1, BIOS version 1007, and
APIC enabled without problem. Current kernel is 2.4.5-ac5, no lockups,
no boot failures, full access to my USB, etc.
With the older BIOS revision, you definitely need to have "noapic" as an
option. For the latest BIOS, just ensure that you set MPS 1.4 support
off.
