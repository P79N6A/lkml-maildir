I don't need the fame here thanks.
I've hit a thousand other ways to corrupt my rootfs, I don't think
it's worth documenting them.  It's arguable this whole item is needed
to be documented, but if you feel compelled to write Red Hat specific
documentation in the swsusp docs, feel free to note that
'make modules_install ; make install' just does the right thing,
including building an initrd for you with all the right pieces.
