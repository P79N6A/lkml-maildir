Matt,
	I'll repeat this here too:
IO APIC - APIC_IO: Testing 8254 interrupt delivery
APIC_IO: Broken MP table detected: 8254 is not connected to IOAPIC #0 intpin 
2 
APIC_IO: routing 8254 via 8259 and IOAPIC #0 intpin 0 
The above is a diagnostic from a FreeBSD box bootup, this would seem to 
suggest that the motherboard rather than Linux is at fault....
