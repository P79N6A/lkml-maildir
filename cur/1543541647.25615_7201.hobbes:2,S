There are two sorts of crap in handling namespace on VFAT.
	* you are getting short names. They behave partially as hardlinks,
partially as hell knows what. They can disappear upon rename (two
different objects become the same). Name that used to be absent may become
present just because you've created a file with totally unrelated name.
You can have several aliases for the same directory. That's the hell NTFS
may miss.
	* these damned short names have a nasty habit of travelling when
you do operations on different names. And that's the thing you will
reproduce with that approach on NTFS.
	BTW, "same inode" thing is obviously wrong, but who says that we
must go for that?
