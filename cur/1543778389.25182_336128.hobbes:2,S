The issue has made me fume enough to contemplating installing windos for
the first time in some 10 years. But I'll persevere. Will learn
ACPI-speak, read bios- and kernelcode. Then return, have no fear (even
if just to admit that the BIOS is buggy). Speaking of bugs, I was
directed, off-list, to the patch which mends your latest chip-away of
C2/C3 for many systems:

It did however not fix my K8 system.

Indeed. It's supposed to be some kind of neutral non-discrimatory
standard... I suppose.
