The existing kgdb core will already allow you to do this. You can
implement the response to the 's' gdb serial packet to be different
per arch and execute arch specific single step routines. While there
are no examples in the mainline sources, I do have some examples which
I could possibly send you for the ARM and MIPS arch. The reason these
are out of the consideration to merge at this time is that A) gdb does
the single stepping B) the kgdb arch specific implementation for ARM
and MIPS have not been merged to the mainline C) there should probably
be something a bit more generic in the kernel for such
activities... perhaps utrace or something else.
Lets just rule out "C)" for the purpose of this thread though. The
kgdbts single step emulation code was something very simple aimed at a
single processor. I would absolutely expect this to fail in the SMP
case.

I don't think you have to actually change gdb, because for sparc64 gdb
is set to "set_gdbarch_software_single_step (gdbarch, NULL);" This
means it is always going to ask the stub to perform the single
stepping.

As mentioned earlier all the plumbing exists such that you can
implement the architecture specific end of things in the architecture
specific kgdb portion.
