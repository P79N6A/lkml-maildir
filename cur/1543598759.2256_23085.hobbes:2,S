I can check again, but I am fairly certain it was the correct System.map (I
looked before and after when running ksymoops).

I am using module autoloading.  It seems that right after the mountall script
is called this happens.

I will try that...  
I did not get the oops, but I could not access the device until I manually
loaded the floppy module (the /dev/fd0 was created as usual).
After booting w/the floppy module not loaded I can start and stop devfsd and
load and unload the floppy module in any order w/o an oops. I only get the
oops if the module is loaded during boot.
Also when I get the oops during boot, the floppy module is not loaded once the
system is through booting and I login, but /dev/fd* are all there!  With out
the oops /dev/fd* is only there when I load the floppy module (and disappears
as usual when I rmmod the module).

I could not mount the floppy until I manually loaded the floppy module!  This
is after editing /etc/fstab as you said below.

I only reference floppy in my perms file.

I have many LOOKUP entries.  I did not have any specific to /dev/fd*, but that
was caught by the .* LOOKUP entry.  I commented that out, which is probably
why mdir and other commands do not work w/o manually loading floppy.o.

I believe I followed your steps, and had no oops during boot w/the /etc/fstab
change.  I do not think that made the difference though.  I think telling
devfsd to not autoload floppy is what let me boot w/o oops.  So I think there
still is a problem w/loading the floppy module during boot.
