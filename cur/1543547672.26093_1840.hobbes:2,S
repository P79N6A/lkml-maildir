You misunderstand... now is the time when Jeff puts the bottle of
booze back in the desk drawer, and tries to "make friends" with
everyone again, using whatever BS tactic of the day he can levy
to stay "Sincerely, your mega buddy Jeff" with the kernel
developers.  Today's 3M pulloff excuse is "I was only joking
about Linux totally sucking and NT kicking the penguin's ass".
Tomorrow it will be "Gee guys, lighten up, I'm your super duper
kernel coder pal...  I was only kidding around...  you see, I
stubbed my toe last night, and... well.. umm... so can we be best
friends again until I act like a jerk and piss you all off
again?  I mean it this time... I'll even give you a bunch of
Novell source code that is completely useless to 99.9% of people 
out there, and then retract it a few months later..."
Sorry, but I just don't take anything he says too seriously
anymore... it's either trolling, or arguing mostly, or babbling
about how much better other OS's are, but not actually using them
for some reason...
<Yawn>
