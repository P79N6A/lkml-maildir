I asked AMD some time ago and they told me it was synchronized.
The TSC on K8 is C state invariant, but not P state invariant,
but P states always happen synchronized on dual cores.
So I'm not quite convinced of your explanation yet.
Most likely you workaround some other bug by switching to pmtimer,
Or just changed the timing enough because pmtimer is incredibly
slow.  It would be better to find the other bug.
