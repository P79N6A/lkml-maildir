A *what*? Example I gave was pretty typical for fs/inode.c, BTW. Would you
care to show me how to rearrange the code in it so that lexical scopes
would become compatible with the lock-holding ones? I'ld like to see the
results. Moreover, I'ld like to the *code* (for ELF, say it on x86) that
would result of said thing. Preferably with exception-related pieces
marked as such in the listing. Do it for the example you've snipped, OK?
Excuse me, it sounds more and more like an irresponsible handvawing. Could
you show how to do what you want the for the code I gave? Complete with
the resulting assembly, please.
