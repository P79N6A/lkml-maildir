My plan is to include security fixes for a kernel or two behind what is
the latest.  Currently, I'm supporting (for Debian) 2.6.8 through
2.6.10.  Of course, normally I wouldn't support 2.6.8 for this long, but
since sarge will (hopefully?) be releasing someday, and this is the
kernel chosen for it, I must continue support.
I do not plan to continue small bugfixes for older kernels too much
longer after a new kernel is released; however, if people were to feed
me patches for older kernels, I'd be more than happy to do releases.
