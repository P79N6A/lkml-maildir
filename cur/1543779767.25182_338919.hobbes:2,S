Subject: [PATCH 0/2] Conversion of /proc/sysvipc/* to seq_file
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

The following two patches convert /proc/sysvipc/* to use seq_file.
This gives us the following:
 - Self-consistent IPC records in proc.
 - O(n) reading of the files themselves.
Please consider applying.  Thanks,
Mike Waychison
