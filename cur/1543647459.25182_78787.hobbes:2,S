When will you be sending me my replacement writers which support cd-mrw?
Hum, I thought not. You ignore the fact that there are at least hundreds
of thousands of devices in use which don't have that feature, but which
will support packet with the existing patches. AFAIK the code exists for
2.4, so perhaps only a port is needed.
Hopefully someone using this can clarify, I tried the code a while ago,
and it worked but was pretty slow. I would still find it useful in many
cases, however, I'm getting smarter about using slow writers :-(
