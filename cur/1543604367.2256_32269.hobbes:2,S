Hi,
Sorry I can't quote the message; I'm not actually on the lkml.
I didn't mean that Alan should apply it to his tree.  I only merged the
fixes so that I could compile (it died on my cube) and figured someone
else might like it.
If I'm propagating bad code, I'll take the patch down and only mess with
my own stuff so as not to hurt others.
I appologize for anything I mistakenly implied by naming my patch as I
did.  My intention was only to give credit and make it easily
identifiable.
I agree, my patches shouldn't ever go into the main kernel trees as they
are half-assed at best. =)
Sorry for the confusion,
-Mike
