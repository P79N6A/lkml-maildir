I do not fully agree with you:
It is true that some ipc tunables play the role of DoS limits.
But IMHO the *mni ones (semmni, msgmni, shmmni) are used by the ipc 
subsystem to adapt its data structures sizes to what is being asked for 
through the tunable value. I think this is how they manage to take into 
account a new tunable value without a need for rebooting the system: 
reallocate some more memory on demand.
Now, what the akt framework does, is that it takes advantage of this 
concept of "on demand memory allocation" to replace a user (or a daemon) 
that would periodically check its ipcs consumptions and manually adjust 
the ipcs tunables: Doing this from the user space would imply a latency 
that makes it difficult to react fast enough to resources running out.
Now, talking about DoS limits, akt implements them in a sense: each 
tunable managed by akt has 3 attributes exported to sysfs:
. autotune: enable / disable auto-tuning
. min: min value the tunable can ever reach
. max: max value the tunable can ever reach
Enabling a sysadmin to play with these min and max values makes it 
possible to refine the dynamic adjustment, and avoid that the tunable 
reaches really huge values.

Nadia
