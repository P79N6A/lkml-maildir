It is unclear what you are really ranting about here. The "stable" 
kernel is stable or at least as stable as it is going to be. It is left 
to distros to make it even more stable. The interface to user land has 
not changed.
If all you are ranting about is the move from devfs to udevd, then all 
the user land tools dealing with them have been updated already.
What is the real specific problem you are having?
