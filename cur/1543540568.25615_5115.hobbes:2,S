   As I needed support for DTR/DSR hardware handshake to communicate with
   a serial printer (and the "wire RTS/CTS to DTR/DSR" tip from the
   serial-HOWTO works fine for a demo, but is not applicable for a few
   thousand POS terminals *gg*), I implemented this functionality.
Yilch.   This is specialized enough that I'd much rather this *not* go
into the kernel.  Next thing we know, someone  will want a DTR/CD
handshaking mechanism, etc.,etc.  
This should probably be a private kernel patch, or (much more strongly
suggested) that you just get specially wired RS-232 cables.  This is in
fact a very standard thing to do, and you can order cables from Black
Box or some other company specializing selling cables which connect
crufty legacy hardware.
