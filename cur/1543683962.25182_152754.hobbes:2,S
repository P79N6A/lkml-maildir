sysfs is relevant for bigger systems but for small embedded stuff the whole
PM layer is fairly "so what". At that level your hardware is tightly defined
and you *know* the power management ordering. Policy becomes critical for 
performance and gets done at a very fine grained level - things like waking
up the flash for a read then turning it back off on a timer for example.
