Which is a combination of two patches, which seems to have dropped the
chunk you show below.  The reason this seems to have my signoff is
that I originated one of those patches, and parts of the second, but
in fact I had never seen f230d3f53d72d05bcb5666ab7e2eccd49c8b3a15
until after this email ...
Your patch looks correct, and seems to be the only obvious chunk
that's missing.  So, I'll ack it FWIW ... usual policy for these
patches is to go through Russell.
I'll note that the whole "mark Atmel's TWI controller BROKEN" patchh
series, making everything use the i2c-gpio instead, has turned up
one more issue at the I2C level:  the i2c_adapter.class for i2c-gpio
needs to include at least the HWMON class bit.
