I'm curious about this, too.  ld-linux.so is a purely unprivileged
program.  It isn't setuid root.  Can you write a variant of ld-linux.so
that reads an executable into memory off of a partition mounted noexec and
then begins executing that code?  (perhaps by using anonymous mmap with
PROT_EXEC or some other mechanism) It sure seems like the answer would
be yes.  If so, I'm having a hard time understanding what guarantees
noexec gives you.  Isn't the noexec flag just a speedbump that raises
the bar a little but doesn't really prevent anything?
