In its i386 version the mce didn't get logged for me too, but I
noticed something like an option for non critical MCEs wasn't
configured in the i386 kernel. That might be the cause, or it's just a
problem for the 64 bit version. Anyway, as I've already posted here
lkml.org/lkml/2008/12/9/4, rebooting with a kexec completely removes
the MCE, so I guess it's a bios problem.
I'm resending this just to put it back on the mailing list.
