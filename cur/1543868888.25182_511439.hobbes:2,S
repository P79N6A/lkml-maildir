Hello,
I'd like to add backlight support for input devices since my custom
board has a backlighted mini keyboard.
It could be acceptable to move the code from drivers/video/backlight/
to drivers/backlight/ renaming the "Backlight & LCD" name into
"Backlight" and adding two new entries "LCD" and, maybe, "Input" (or
something like that?).
Thanks in advance,
Rodolfo
