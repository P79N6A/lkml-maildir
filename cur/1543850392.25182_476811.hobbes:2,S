Hmmm....
I think we already have what you want if we would disable the allnodes 
domain. The next sched domain layer contains 16 surrounding nodes 
from which it can pull processes. If there would be severe overload on one 
node  then processes would be gradually migrated away from it but it would 
require multiple migration steps.
Nevertheless, I still think we need this patchset because of the general 
interrupt hold off issue. The livelock is extreme case but it general we 
do no want long interrupt holdoffs but keep the period in which we would 
be executing with interrupts off minimal.
