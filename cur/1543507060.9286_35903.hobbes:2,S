Hi there!
After compiling the new Kernel 2.2 I remembered that in earlier
versions the README file stated to have softlinks at /usr/include/linux
(and others) point to the kernel include files.
I wonder why this hint is now missing? After installing the new Kernel
my include files in /usr/include/linux (and others) are still the old
ones and thus some programs fail to compile.
Please, for the unexperienced user, list the softlinks one has to 
setup to get the correct include files!
Cheers
