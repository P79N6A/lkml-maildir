Subject: [PATCH 1/6] freepgt2: free_pgtables from FIRST_USER_ADDRESS
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/4/6/233

The patches to free_pgtables by vma left problems on any architectures
which leave some user address page table entries unencapsulated by vma.
Andi has fixed the 32-bit vDSO on x86_64 to use a vma.  Now fix arm (and
arm26), whose first PAGE_SIZE is reserved (perhaps) for machine vectors.
Our calls to free_pgtables must not touch that area, and exit_mmap's
BUG_ON(nr_ptes) must allow that arm's get_pgd_slow may (or may not) have
allocated an extra page table, which its free_pgd_slow would free later.
FIRST_USER_PGD_NR has misled me and others: until all the arches define
FIRST_USER_ADDRESS instead, a hack in mmap.c to derive one from t'other.
This patch fixes the bugs, the remaining patches just clean it up.
