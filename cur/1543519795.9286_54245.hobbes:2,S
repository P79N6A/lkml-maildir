We (Xfree86) had a similar idea, too. It doesn't make much sense
to build different drivers for the same chipset considering the
limited number of really experienced driver people. Even if one
project uses code from another project as example it is still a
lot of work. 
However there are a  problem: Xfree86 4.0 has departed from the 
low level driver model 3.3 uses: Instead of passing a huge structure 
to the midlevel code to infor it of the properties of the lowlevel 
driver - which needs to get extended whenever new features get 
added to the server - the driver does a lot of initialization 
itself by calling the approprate functions. 
If for example the driver supports acceleration for 24bpp it
will call the initialization functions for that when 24bpp is
requested.
With this model we have a lot of Xserver specific setup calls
in the driver which other systems don't require or require
differnetly.
