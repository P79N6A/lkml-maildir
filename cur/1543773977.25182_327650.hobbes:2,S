Hello:
Trying to compile 2.6.12 here and am getting the following error. I am 
currently running 2.4.31 and have upgraded the needed bits per the Change 
document before trying the build:
[root@eagle src]# cd linux
[root@eagle linux]# make mrproper
   CLEAN   .config
[root@eagle linux]# cp ../config-2.4.31 .config
[root@eagle linux]# make oldconfig
   HOSTCC  scripts/basic/fixdep
In file included from /usr/local/include/netinet/in.h:212,
                  from /usr/local/include/arpa/inet.h:23,
                  from scripts/basic/fixdep.c:115:
/usr/local/include/bits/socket.h:304: asm/socket.h: No such file or 
directory
make[1]: *** [scripts/basic/fixdep] Error 1
make: *** [scripts_basic] Error 2
Any help is appreciated, 2.4.31 will compile just fine and I am trying 
make oldconfig with 2.6.12
