Yinghai - i think Matt is right and there are a number of things we could 
do to improve cleanliness here. (Matt, sorry about this - we'll quickly 
fix it.)
The most important thing to observe is that the irq_desc->timer_rand_state 
cleanup you did should be made unconditional, and should not depend on 
SPARSE_IRQ. That will eliminate most of the #ifdefs, and it makes the 
random.c and random.h impact rather straightforward.
Another cleanliness detail is that these types of checks:
#ifndef CONFIG_SPARSE_IRQ
        if (irq >= nr_irqs)
                return;
#endif
can go away completely. They were needed from the sparseirq data model 
that had a dynamic array size - but that is not so anymore, so we can 
remove these complications.
Agreed?
