ueing /etc/issue is a BAD idea, while that may work for completely 
unmodified systems, many companies require legalese be put in there.

or they need to go through the process of getting their driver included in 
the main kernel and these headaches go away.

it's less likly that the people running the 6.x distros are going to be 
installing the latest and greatest hardware that needs the new 
out-of-kernel driver, but if you think you need to create modules that 
will work with every kernel since 2.0 have fun.
