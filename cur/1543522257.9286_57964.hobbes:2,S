Sorry, Pavel. No system can be secure if it allows you to do something
interesting. If you screw up and misuse its features, it your fault.
I wonder what security risks you see in reusing pids. The idea of
generating temporary files using the pid is braindamaged, even gcc (where
there are no big security problems unless your system is _very_ broken wrt
/tmp) doesn't use it anymore (take a look at the wounderful names it uses
now for temporary files).

So what? Pavel can shoot himself in the foot, big deal. root can do
incredibly stupid things like doing a ps(1), run a few random programs and
then kill(1) what ps(1) told half an hour ago. Right, there is a race
there, and root might end up killing the wrong program. So root has to be
careful, and not go on a killing spree, no change there.

Then run each sandbox with a different UID. That is the standard way of
limiting access in Unix.
