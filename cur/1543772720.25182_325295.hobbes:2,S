Unless correctly handling the side effects requires changes to the
mainstream as well as to the RT implementations, as it might well for
I/O, networking, and IPC.  Again, I believe that it might be some time
before we get to this point, so am not all that worried about it.

Yours and Kristian's benchmarking contribution is quite timely and
substantial, and I know that I am not the only one who very much
appreciates it!
