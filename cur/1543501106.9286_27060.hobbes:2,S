As a joke I always wanted to make a clone of MSD for Linux, just
because you could call it LSD, for humour-value. I haven't done
it because /proc and procinfo pretty much does that already.

I think there is a clause that states the source of that will be
release on 19xx or maybe 20xx as GPL.. he's mentioned it in the past.

To be safe you could make a statically linked version for
major releases (2.0, 2.2, etc) or try to make it fairly kernel
independant.
