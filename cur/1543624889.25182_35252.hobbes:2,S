I think there are something wrong in MM of -ac tree. I can't build & run my
project (~100 source files) from inside JBuilder4 anymore. JBuilder always
reports that "cannot allocate memory".
My system:
CPU: K6-III 500Mhz
Mem: 128Mb
Swap: 64Mb
Linux From Scratch 3.1
Tested with:
2.4.19-pre3: OK
2.4.19-pre2-ac4: cannot allocate memory
2.4.19-pre3-ac1: cannot allocate memory
2.4.19-pre2aa*: OK
2.4.19-pre3aa*: OK

MrChuoi
