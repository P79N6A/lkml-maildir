Thanks.

Yes, this one does fit the criteria for stable (even though the patch
fortuitously turns out not to be necessary in 2.6.16): it fixes a serious
observed user problem.  Not sure what to do with the associated patches
to other drivers though, since those problems have not been knowingly
observed: probably best leave them to maintainer's discretion.
