Hi,
i am using an ASUS P5AD2Premium Board with a P4 3,4 LGA 775 CPU.
This one has got 2 Gigabit PCI Express Ethernet cards on-board.
lspci 
0000:02:00.0 Ethernet controller: Marvell Technology Group Ltd. Gigabit Ethernet Controller (rev 15)
0000:03:00.0 Ethernet controller: Marvell Technology Group Ltd. Gigabit Ethernet Controller (rev 15)
both 2 are working, but when i load the driver modules 
i get 2 unrecoverable PciExpress Hardware failures.
Drivers are not implemented in the Kernel Mainstream but as syskonnect told me, already send to the devs.
Driver version from syskonnect is v 7.09
obtainable @
