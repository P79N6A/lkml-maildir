"Linux" is not a well-defined quantity.
You do not reveal what kernel you use. Or what fdisk version.
With a recent kernel and a recent cfdisk, all should be well.
[More precise discussion: 2.2.14 will invent a translation with
255 heads, so that you would see CHS=4560/255/63 or so.
Things should work without any further user action.
2.3.21+ follows a more puristic line, and does not invent translations
when nobody asks for them. You can get one by specifying boot parameters.
You also get one when the partition table suggests you are using one.
Without translation, C will be larger than 65536 and hence cannot be
reported by the HDIO_GETGEO ioctl, as you remark. Fortunately, recent
cfdisk versions do not use that ioctl, so all is well.
Of course the idea is that we want to get rid of everything that
reminds of disk geometry - it is a concept of the past.
Now that HDIO_GETGEO is broken, instead of repairing it we just
eliminate all places where it was used.]
