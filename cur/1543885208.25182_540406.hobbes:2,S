It's error path and that print is not really needed. We'll see other
complaints in that case. And this is _the only_ place outside scan.c, so
it makes sense to use list_add_tail(). We do not really need to hide
this behind some other call (ubi_scan_add_to_list())

Yes, per-PEB scanning information is allocated in ubi_scan_add_to_list()
and ubi_scan_add_to_used(). I do not see why it shouldn't be doing that.

It actually is rather complex because it does a rather complex thing.
But any patch/idea to make it simpler is welcome.

It is only freed in ubi_scan_destroy_si(). Yes, there is one exception
in create_vtbl, but this is because I did not want to introduce any
special version of ubi_scan_add_used().
It does not hurt at all that we do one extra allocation, because it is
called _only_ 2 times (once for each volume table copy).

Sorry. not sure what you mean. They are allocated in 2 places, and freed
in one, with one exception in vtbl_create() which does not matter much.

May be it is, but I have 2 places and do not see any problem.

I have 1 destroy location. And one exception where I allocate it
temporarily and destroy in the same function. And it is done only 2
times and only if one attaches un-formatted flash.

Thanks for your analysis, it would be helpful if more people did this.
