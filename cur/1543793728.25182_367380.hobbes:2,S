Yes! I worried about same things.
How is this?
static inline int pfn_to_nid(unsigned long pfn)
{
	return page_to_nid(pfn_to_page(pfn));
}
page_to_nid() and pfn_to_page() is well defined.
Probably, this will work on all architecture.
So, just we should check this should be used after that memmap
is initialized.
Bye.
