I misspelled patch on the subject of the first mail, some plp's filters
may miss it (I guess) so here it goes again.
I thinks these were missed during 2.5.2-pre6, Feren I hope you are
the right person to send the for the first patch (your name is listed as
the Maintainer),Gerd yours is listed for the second patch.
