You really think that. Uhmm, ok.

No, I don't think I will. Since 1) it's so trivial it's not even 
challenging 2) you know it can be done (I assume) 3) it solves a non-case 
made up to justify an API/kernel-code bloating.
But you don't need *my* signoff. Cook a working patch, make a case for it, 
and gather support and signoffs. I won't be acking it because, as I said 
many times, I think it's useless bloating.
