Well, the only place that I know of where I (have to) care about
inter_module*() is because of the DRM/AGP dependency.  I can't imagine
DRM being overly happy if an AGP device suddenly disappeared, so I
think static is fine (in fact, probably preferable).
Of course, the trick is how to pull the backwards compatibility off
giving that for the time being we're more or less stuck with Nvidia's
5336 release on ia64... ;-(
