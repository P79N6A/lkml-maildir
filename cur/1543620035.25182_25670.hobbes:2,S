Hello everyone,
While playing around I noticed that if I fork()ed, then did ptrace(PTRACE_TRACEME,...) then exec'd a non-readable binary, the ptrace interface would let me read the binary.
This was tested on 2.4.17ctx-5 (the security context patch), however I have been told it works on vanilla kernels, also I tested it on 2.4.2-pax on an old machine. (pentium 75...)
For those who want some demo code, you can find it at 
http://203.39.161.186/readbin.tgz.
For testing it, I used /usr/bin/ssh which was rws--x--x.
Since I'm not subscribed to this list, could any replies be cc'd to me? Thanks.
Sincerely,
Andrew Griffiths
