It's not clear to me where do you want to put the check. I suppose not in
the end of disable_irq() otherwise the check would be a nono, and
returning without wait and then doing an enable_irq() (with the current
enable_irq() that clear the inprogress bit) would increase the door for
the popular irq-SMP race.

I thought the current semantic of synchronize_irq() is that
synchronize_irq() simply flush the _running_ _irqhandler_ (not the
raw-irq) and so is _far_ from making sure that there won't be a new irq
after the call.
If somebody want to protect itself against a particular irq (thing that
make tons of sense) he should use _disable_irq()_ __alone__ and _nothing_
more. If he can accpet the last irq running but on a different cpu he can
use my new disable_irq_nosync() to get better performances and SMP
scalability (like in our case).
I think it's _only_ disable_irq() that must make sure that no other irqX
will run after the call. synchronize_irq() has not such semantic (at least
according to me) and I don't consider it buggy (so it's not obvious that
we want to make it bloated -> irqinprogress/irqdisabled aware). This also
considering that cli() instead is perfectly safe for the underlined line:
static inline void irq_enter(int cpu, unsigned int irq)
{
	hardirq_enter(cpu);
	while (test_bit(0,&global_irq_lock)) {
	       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
		/* nothing */;
	}
}
But if you then issue a sti() (as synchronize_irq() does) the pending irq
will unblock (and it will be allowed to race in the disable_irq case)
then.

I don't consider it a messing but a _fixage_. And btw inprogress made me
to think that something is running for real, right now it would be better
to call it `irqhappened' ;).
My _main_ point against the current logic (and I hope to convince you ;)  
is that the inprogress bit is the bit that has to make sure that the irq
won't reenter itself. So in turn I think that a clean design imply that
the inprogress bit has to be touched __only__ by irqhandlers and not from
a foregin function (and doing that infact was causing the irq to reenter
in itself). If the inprogress bit is touched only by irq handlers it's
trivial to verify that there are no races. That's why I claim it a more
robust/cleaner design.
Really in this case it's been _far_ better that it harmed since due it I
noticed also the synchronize_irq nono ;) but...

Yes in both my `second' patch and in the latest one I just updated the
probing logic to the new behaviour.
I had to clear the IRQ_DISABLE bit and then to reenable it after the probe
(just before the ->shutdown) in order to get the INPROGRESS bit set while
doing the probe (see the last lines of the irq.c part of my patch).
The reason that irqprobing works with my code is that we probe _only_ irqs
that have no action queued. And if the action is NULL all raw-irq handler
are leaving IRQ_INPROGRESS enabled. Then when you'll register an action
the request_irq call will automagically clear both irqinprogress and
disableirq bits. When you'll free an irq then irqdisabled will be set. My
changes seems fine to me (and they definitely works for my hardware that
uses for sure irq probe because before updating the probing code to the
new behaviour (I described above) I noticed some more not happy printk at
boot ;).
Last but not the least: my irqinprogress changes should make no
performance difference (if something it should improve the unlikely case).

I am very happy to hear that ;)). It would be nice also to get some report
from people that was experiencing lockups though... ;)

According to me it's still strictly needed to know for sure _when_ the
last irq expired. And with the removal of the clear_bit(inprogress) from
enable_irq now I am not forced to wait that the irq will expire before
returning from disable_irq(). Now able to use a disable_irq_nosync(`N')
function. This function will make sure that there won't be irq `N' running
on the CPU that called the disable_irq(), but it may allow to go ahead
even if the last irq `N' is still running in some remote CPU (and that
it's the thing we want in the network card code). This will obviously
improve SMP scalability (maybe only a bit but we got it for free with my
cleaner irqinprogress logic...).
You can't do that instead with the current IRQINPROGRESS exactly because
enable_irq is doing dirty things with the irqinprogress bit.

Maybe I am on the wrong track but quite frankly I still think my last
patch (the merging of the previous ones plus the
s/synchronize_irq/barrier/) is the proper/right fix.

For curiosity I taken a look to the first two usages of synchronize_irq()
that a recursive grep picked up in the device drivers directory.
drivers/net/de4x5.c:
de4x5_interrupt(int irq, void *dev_id, struct pt_regs *regs)
{
    struct device *dev = (struct device *)dev_id;
    struct de4x5_private *lp;
    s32 imr, omr, sts, limit;
    u_long iobase;
    
    if (dev == NULL) {
	printk ("de4x5_interrupt(): irq %d for unknown device.\n", irq);
	return;
    }
    lp = (struct de4x5_private *)dev->priv;
    spin_lock(&lp->lock);
    iobase = dev->base_addr;
	
    DISABLE_IRQs;                        /* Ensure non re-entrancy */
    if (test_and_set_bit(MASK_INTERRUPTS, (void*) &lp->interrupt))
	printk("%s: Re-entering the interrupt handler.\n", dev->name);
    synchronize_irq();
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
a cli() inside an irq handler will be a nono so synchronize_irq would be
a nono too.
Here from plip.c:
	if (error == HS_TIMEOUT) {
		DISABLE(dev->irq);
		synchronize_irq();
	}
here it's harming performances (there are many like this one in plip.c
as there was some in 8390.c).
