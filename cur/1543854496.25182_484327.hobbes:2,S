I think, what Russell means, is this:
#define is_real_interrupt(irq) ((irq) != NO_IRQ)
where the NO_IRQ macro has been introduced a LONG time ago specifically 
for this purpose, and is conveniently defined on some platforms to 
(unsigned int)-1 or similar, including asm-powerpc/irq.h. And yes, this 
has been discussed MANY times.
