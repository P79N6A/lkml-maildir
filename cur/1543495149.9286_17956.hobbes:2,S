Hi guys,
I think we can consider to stop here this topic and follow the Linus line to keep it 
away from the kernel list and possibly from all.
This is the place where we must deal to make a better Linux and leave time to decide 
if Mr Thompson is right about the future of our OS.
Bye all,
		Davide.
