Yes, we had this when you insisted on the deprecation period for 
sys_open which still brings me to explosion each time such topics come 
up and brought you _very_ near at being the first person ever in my 
killfile.
I don't get your point why bigger API changes should still be allowed 
without any advance warning while removing an export should require 
deprecation periods.
If you want to offer a stable API for external modules then please do 
it completely and with all consequences.
