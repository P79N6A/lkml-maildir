It is a bk clone 
http://linux.bkbits.net:8080/linux-2.5
And I  imported the i4l-2.6.3-rc1-bk2 patch

Here are the latest versions, since they are so big only as reference:
Linus tree:
ftp://ftp.isdn4linux.de/pub/isdn4linux/kernel/v2.6/i4l-2.6.3-rc1-bk2.gz
Andrew tree:
ftp://ftp.isdn4linux.de/pub/isdn4linux/kernel/v2.6/i4l-2.6.3-rc1-mm1.gz
The result of both patches are the same source, but in Andrews tree
some smaller fixes were already included, to avoid rejects I
created patches for both trees.
ChangeLog:
- new port of 2.4 I4L core to 2.6
- new port of 2.4 I$L HiSax to 2.6
- fixes for I4L CAPI subsystem to make it stable in 2.6
- fix parameter handling of AVM ISA cards (calle)
- cleanup ISDN config variables
These patches are in sync with I4L cvs (kernel 2.6 branch).
