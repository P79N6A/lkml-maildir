Steven Hein <ssh@sgi.com> sent me a patch that supposedly fix device 
registers misinitialization when it is being frequently reseted.
RTL8150 is quite flaky piece of HW so i first tested the new value and it 
did work for me.  That's why i decided to send it to Greg.
I would say lets wait for some time and see if we'll break someone else's
heart and then reverse the patch.  Another solution is to restore the 
original value and add new module parameter, so whoever thinks
anything != 0x10 work better for him will be free to change it.
