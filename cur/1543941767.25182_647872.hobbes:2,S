Hello,
I am suffering from the following (usb-related?) problem:
I have several different mashines - all x86 architecture - just lets 
call them mashineA, mashineB and mashineC.
Anyway, mashineA has a severe problem with a 
Kingston-USB-pendrive(2gig). I simply cant install anything on it - the 
kernel usually moans with problems like "attempt to access beyond end of 
device" - while it does work fine with several noname usb-pendrives of 
the same size.
Now, I just tested that kingston pendrive on mashineB and mashineC - 
where it runs fine .. I can install debian to it (same installation 
media) without any problem or kernel errors.
I compared the output of dmesg and fdisk from mashineA and mashineB and 
C .. and the difference is simple: mashineA always shows 248 cylinders - 
while all the other mashines show 228 cylinders.
So I guess this is the problem and especially the reason why using it on 
mashineA always fails.
mashineA has the following usb chipset:
vendor     = 'Intel Corporation'
device     = '82801DB/DBL/DBM (ICH4/ICH4-L/ICH4-M) USB 2.0 EHCI Controller'
Hopefully you have any suggestions.
