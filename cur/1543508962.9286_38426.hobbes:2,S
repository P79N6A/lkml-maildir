Are there any remaining issues with file locking over NFS in the 2.2.x
kernels ? I am aware of the server issues but not any client ones.
Here is a simple case using the program 'inc' (which includes new mail -
part of nmh-0.27 as comes with RedHat 6.0). It is compiled for fcntl locking.
NFS Server - Irix 6.4 NFS v2/v3 capable
NFS Client - RedHat 6.0 Linux 
  Kernel        Status
  ------        ------
  2.0.36        works
  2.2.5-22      inc: unable to lock and fopen /nfs/home/test/.mail
                kernel: lockd: failed to monitor xx.xx.xx.xx
  2.2.10                 ditto
  2.2.16                 ditto
  2.3.16        works
  ------        ------
strace says..
open("/nfs/home/test/.mail", O_RDWR|O_NONBLOCK) = 3
fcntl(3, F_SETLK, {type=F_WRLCK, whence=SEEK_SET, start=0, len=0}) = -1 ENOLCK (No locks available)
close(3)                                    = 0
I didn't want to waste any time on this if it was a known problem or my
silliness. It would be great if all the NFS v2 issues could be resolved
for 2.4 ...
