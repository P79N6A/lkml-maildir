Thanks, this looks good in principle, but I think it can be
implemented in a simpler way.
Jens, can I please ask your opinion. Would it make sense to export the
clear_queue_congested() and set_queue_congested() functions in
ll_rw_blk.c so that the pktcdvd driver can use them? Something like
this patch from a few years ago:
