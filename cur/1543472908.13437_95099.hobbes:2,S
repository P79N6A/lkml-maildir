This is already insecure; you can do better by reading 4 bytes from
/dev/{u,}random as appropriate.  Also, I would probably use a
cryptographic hash function instead...if someone manages to recover
one of the random numbers you've generated with this PRNG, they can
recover the entire sequence; it's much more difficult to go back
with an appropriate hash function.  You should also be able to do
other things that would hinder the forward prediction, as well...
