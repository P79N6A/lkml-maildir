I have since found out that SMP kernels should(must?) have Enhanced RTC 
support built-in.
It is stated in kernel config help for Enhanced RTC support, and I found 
a number of references on the net as well.
Now I wonder why selecting SMP does not set Enhanced RTC support to "Y" 
automatically?
I am building a kernel right now, and will monitor for a week or so, 
then come back and report if it removes the problem.
