I put them there mostly as assertions.  What I'd really want there is
a DEBUG_BUG_ON, which is more like assert() in user-land (i.e.,
production code would drop the checks).  WARN_ON() would be fine, too.

I thought I did.  Suppose somebody changed the dma_pool code such that
it would overwrite freed memory with an 0xf00000000000000 pattern.  If
the HC can still hold a reference to a freed ED (it can without my
patch), the HC could see this kind of ED:
 hw=(info=00000000 tailp=f0000000 headp=00000000 nextED=f0000000)
If so, the HC would go ahead and try to interpret the memory at
address 0 as a transfer descriptor.  Depending on the memory contents,
this could cause silent data corruption at an arbitrary address.

You lost me here.  All I'm saying is that the current code has a
dangerous race that can corrupt memory, crash machines, or have all
sorts of other wild side-effects.  I never claimed this bug had
anything todo with the BTC keyboard problem.
