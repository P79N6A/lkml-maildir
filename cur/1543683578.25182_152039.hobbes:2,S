Definitely wrong.  I was going to undo this change since I realised how
it doesn't work for you; but the change you made to the PCI code is wrong.
It ends up copying everything to offset 0 from the buf address.  I wish
Pat had cc'd me when making the change to the interface originally ;-(
I'll whip up a patch in a few minutes.
