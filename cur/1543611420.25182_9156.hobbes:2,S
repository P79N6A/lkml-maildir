Hi,
  I've experienced the same slowdown problem with Alcatel Speedtouch USB modem.
It should run fine again if you use the usb-uhci module instead of uhci.
 I think something is broken in uhci.c since 2.4.10. Many users of the
speedtouch usb modem wrote to our ML to report such a problem. All users
were using uhci. I've done some basic tests and uhci was responsible of the
slowndown. 2.4.11 solved the timeouts problems, but the slowdown has not been
solved yet.
