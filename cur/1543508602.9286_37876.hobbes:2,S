Update just executes sync() at some interval. You can hack out a new
update daemon as:
int main(int unused, char *argv[])
{
    if(fork()) return 0;
    strcpy(argv[0], "bdflush");
    for(;;)
    {
        sync();
        sleep(30);
    }
}
Now, the problem is with the flash file. You can hack the sources
../linux/fs/super.c, to sync your device only after each 'N' times
it's called. Unmounting a device will sync it, but it will take a
longer time than usual if it hasn't been synchronized recently.
Cheers,
