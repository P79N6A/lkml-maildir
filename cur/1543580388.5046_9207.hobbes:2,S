Subject: [PATCH] minor ne2k-pci irq fix
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi,
while testing the SiS routing code, at some point my ne2k-pci didn't work
anymore. Was when BIOS was set for PnP OS and IRQ set to "auto" for the
NIC. Had to rmmod/insmod the ne2k-pci module after reboot to make it
working again.
Reason: we fetched the irq too early, before calling pci_enable_device(),
so it was bogus after initial routing.
Patch below (prepared for 2.4.0 - should be fine for 2.4.1 too).
Regards
Martin
