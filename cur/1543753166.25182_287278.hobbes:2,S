sb->s_time_gran is the granularity used for the time in each fs in
nanoseconds.  So, for example in NTFS it is set to 100 as NTFS stores
time as 100ns intervals.  This means the kernel time can be rounded
appropriately when the fs inode times are being updated.  Without this
you can see inode time jumping backwards in time if the inode is thrown
out of memory and then read in again and in the process it had some of
the time bits truncated...
See the original post of the patch from Andi Kleen for details:
