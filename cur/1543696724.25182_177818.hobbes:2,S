Greetings;
In the process of getting ready to swap to a new boot drive, a 
"grub-install" put everything on /dev/hdd since it was mapped to 
'(hd1)' in the /boot/grub/device.list.
I fixed the device.list on the current boot drive, hda, and reran the 
grub-install script.  But do I need to undo what it did to /dev/hdd 
before I make /dev/hdb into /dev/hda, and make /dev/hda into /dev/hdb 
by swapping jumpers on the drive and rebooting?  I've fixed the 
/etc/fstab copy put on the new drive to reflect the new partition 
numbers for this and that.
With 3 drives stacked up, they are running very hot, and I'd like to 
get /dev/hdd out of there, and space the old /dev/hda up into its 
location giveing an empty space between the drives so they'll run 
cooler as quickly as I can.  I think I'll need to edit the copy of 
grub.conf on the new drive to boot from the correct / partition too.
Have I missed anything?
