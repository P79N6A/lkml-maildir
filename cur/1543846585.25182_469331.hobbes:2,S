Haha. Because Jean thinks it isn't and thus everything is fine. But in
reality it is.

Yes: drivers are expected to mostly handle the ioctls directly without a
layer between them and userspace.

cfg80211 and nl80211 actually do this abstraction, nl80211 gets requests
and rewrites them to cfg80211 structures that are passed to the driver.
I have plans for wext/cfg80211 compat code, essentially replacing the
interface between the drivers and wext by cfg80211 and letting userspace
not even be aware of it.
