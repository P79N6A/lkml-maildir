I have added the lign
append="video=atyfb:1280x1024-16@76 video=aty128fb:1600x1200-16@75"
Is that correct?
on the 2.3.30 kernel entry and the system still hangs on boot, but just after the
atyfb : 3D RAGE PRO (PQFP, PCI) [0x4750 rev 0x7e] 512K RESV, 14.31818 MHz PLL, 100 MHz MCLK
I see NO VIDEO MEMORY or NO VIDEO RAM (I should have noticed it...).
a few time (less than ten).
That's really strange: there's 8Mb on that card.
And is there some hope for aty128fb supporting the boot choice?
Thanks,
