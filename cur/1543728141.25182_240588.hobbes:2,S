Hi,

-O5 fixes the APIC lockup issues. The bug was primarily caused by PCI 
POST delays causing IRQ storms of level-triggered IRQ sources that were 
hardirq-redirected. Also found some bugs in delayed-IRQ masking and 
unmasking. SMP should thus work again too. 
Indeed, -O5 is running fine here with all APIC options enabled. Great
work, thanks!
