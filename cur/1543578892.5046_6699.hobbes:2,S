Correct. That was a copy-paste error from the P6 code.
When writing to a perfctr MSR, Intel P6 sign-extends bit 31.
P5 and Pentium 4 [*], and AMD K7 don't sign-extend, so there one
has to pass -1 in the high word.
[*] P4? PIV? P15? NB? Oh why oh why couldn't they just have named
the core P7 ...

The varying speed of this counter is unfortunate, but at least
it doesn't stop completely. The NMI oopser should still trigger,
although perhaps after a much longer delay.

Great. Thanks.
