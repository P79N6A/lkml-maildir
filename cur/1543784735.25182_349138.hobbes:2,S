This will be very disruptive.

I hope list.h was a poorly-chosen example, and that there are no plans to
actually do anything like the above to list.h.
Surely the only files which need to be altered are those which we can
reasonably expect userspace to actually include.

I'd suggest that you avoid side-effects.  Unrelated cleanups are unrelated
- do it as a separate project.
I'm very dubious about the whole idea, frankly.
