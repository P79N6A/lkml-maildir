What exactly is the O_DIRECT flag? When I add this flag to the open func
it fails.
More specificaly, this function fails
  open("filename", O_RDWR | O_DIRECT | O_LARGEFILE | O_CREAT, S_IRWXU);   
but this one succeeds
  open("filename", O_RDWR | O_LARGEFILE | O_CREAT, S_IRWXU);   
I'm running linux 2.6.0 with libaio 0.3.92.
