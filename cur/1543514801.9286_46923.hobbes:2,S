On the IBM thinkpad 770 for example, the sound is provided by
a Crystal chipset, which is perfectly handled by the cs4232
kernel module. The only thing that cuases trouble is that
sound becomes hashed when coming back from a apm suspend state.
The hack is to modularize the sound module, and to
rmmod() and inmod() this module when this sync loose happens.
You need to kill the sound apps before.
The other probable cause is a slow CPU. You can try
MP3 with slower bitrates to confirm this.
Best regards,
