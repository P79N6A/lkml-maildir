In Your oprofile output I find "acpi_pm_read" particulary interesting. Unlike 
other VIA chipsets, which I know, Your doesn't use VLink to connect northbridge 
to southbridge. Instead PCI bus connects these two. As You probably know 
maximal PCI throughtput is 133MiB/s. In theory. In practice probably less.
ACPI registers are located on southbridge. This probably means that processor 
needs access to PCI bus in order to read ACPI timer register.
Now some math. 20GiB disk probably can send data at 20MiB/s rate. 200GiB 
disk probably about 40MiB/s. So 20+2*40=100MiB/s. I think that this could 
explain why simple inl() call takes so much time and why Your system isn't 
very responsive.

Let me know if You find my theory amazing or amusing.
