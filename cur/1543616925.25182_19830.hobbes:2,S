Not sure what happened there, but I just put a fixed version
in place (actually the same one I uploaded, just the mirrored
copy got broken somehow).
Fixed version should be 1582128 bytes, and has the following md5sum
380ffa46db6c37e22d4780f20e341c57  patch-2.5.1-dj14.diff.gz
Thanks for letting me know.
Dave.
