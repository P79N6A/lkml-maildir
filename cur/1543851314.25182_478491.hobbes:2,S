I suggested change instead of transition because, like most uses of
change, this was a manual relabel rather than automatic. Transition
probably makes more sense, though.

This is all predicated on the notion that there is a need to have the
normal SELinux checks performed. Since this serves only as a sanity
check and doesn't add any real security the best option seems bypass,
but I guess that isn't an option.
Additionally, whether the security context comes from a config file or
the policy there is still a chance that we will end up with a security
context without sufficient access. Debugging this is going to be
mysterious for the policy author as it will require detailed knowledge
of the kernel mechanism.
I guess the target SID could be the kernel initial sid and the class
process - though that is basically arbitrary. This is an abuse of the
interface to avoid a config file. Any other options?

fssid seems like the wrong name, though it does match the DAC concept.
This is really more general impersonation of another domain by the
kernel and might have other uses.
