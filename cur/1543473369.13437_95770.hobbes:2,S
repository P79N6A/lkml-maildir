... which tells you that the AMD engineers did a good job optimizing their
branch prediction code for (such tiny) loops. Reminds me of the old story of
the loop machine insn being much slower on recent intel CPUs than decl ecx;
jnz/jns; (This was a deliberate decision by intel not shared by AMD and
Cyrix.) 
However, don't confuse this with benchmark results, which again should not
be confused with real life performance.
