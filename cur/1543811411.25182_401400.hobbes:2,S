No, that's right.

Sigh.  The floppy driver's just a jpke.  Looks like the failed allocation
fell back to vmalloc then screwed it up.
I rather doubt whether x86_64 needs to be constraining itself to the ISA
DMA region anyway - something for Andi to look at please?
You could try this one instead, although I guess I'll need to fire up the
test box for this bug.
