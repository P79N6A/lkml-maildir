Joerg, read what is written in the emails. You'll find it much easier to
carry a discussion if you have read what you reply to.
I said that you provide zero evidence of the bugs you list. Some of them
are fixable (sense bug we already uncovered, if you would fix it in your
code. SG_SET_RESERVED_SIZE patch has been submitted to linus from me),
some of them will not be fixed as they are not bugs (addressing issues),
and yet some of them are utterly impossible to fix since you provide
nothing to back them up. "Some SCSI driver breaks with bad dma
alignment" - what the hell am I supposed to do with that? Go audit all
SCSI drivers and your whim and see if I can find such a bug in there?
