Yes, I asked Song Jiang about whether this was a normal behavior, and he 
mentioned it would be an easy fix.

Can say that again...

"Complete" would seem to be impossible. Exercise all code paths, sure. But 
exercise all usage patterns, I think you're just going to have to pick a few 
scenarios and hope you didn't miss anything bad.

Is *anything* really representative of "most people"? After all there is 
nobody out there who is actually Joe Average.

No great ideas spring to mind. We very seldom run in machines that are 
memory-constrained, so very few of our tests are oriented toward that.
If you're just testing to see if getting rid of swappiness is feasible, I 
think a fair test would just be a program that alternately touches 
file-backed pages vs anonymous RAM. E.g., allocate 2GB of RAM and mmap 2GB of 
a file on a machine with only 2GB of free RAM. Walk through each memory range 
and make sure the balance of memory shifts as expected. Cycle that, increase 
the stride on each cycle, and toss some other variations in there. You don't 
need to drive real apps, you just need to have a couple of threads exerting 
pressure.
