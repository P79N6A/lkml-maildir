I experienced the same problem with Supermicro and Intel E7500 board. Look
on 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/lse
for the apic routing patch. This patch, when applied, will solve the issue

I can find a patch for the i7500 chipset IRQ problem.
Is it still unsolved ? ... I have a full custom PCI device that does not 
receive an IRQ...
Any suggestion ?? 
tnx in advance
