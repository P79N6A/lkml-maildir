I did some more tests today and found out that 
"0000:00:01.0 PCI bridge: Intel Corp. 82855PM Processor to AGP
Controller (rev 21) (prog-if 00 [Normal decode])"
wasn't correctly resumed either.
I wrote a script to dump the pci data (from lspci -x $device). Importing
the data after a resume freezes the machine *if one is touching data
that hasn't been changed during S3*. If I only change the values which
were modified after resume, the machine does *not* freeze.
Maybe that's the problem with pci_default_resume. It looks like it is
just writing back the data it has stored before resuming. Maybe one
should only write the values which have actually changed?
Anyways, using my little script, i managed to restore the PCI data of
the "Processor to AGP Controller" and the Radeon card after a resume.
If X is running on VT7 and one suspends from VT1 and after resuming
switches back to VT7 ( after restoring the PCI data ), the backlight
goes on but the display is still empty.
Looks like I'm still missing something. To bad boot-radeon always
segsfaults :\ 
An int10 call after restoring the PCI data might just do the trick.
