it is absolutely and emphatically not worth it.
even in a hypothetical scenario [which this patchset is _not_ analogous 
to] where a new, clean subsystem introduces significant overhead, but 
the old subsystem is unclean, we frequently go with the new one - 
because it's so much easier to speed up something that is clean, robust 
and well-designed, than something that has been cobbled together!
