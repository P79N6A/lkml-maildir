It doesn't. Lacking a crystal ball, it relies on heuristics
to achive this. It generally works.

Well yes, for any IO scheduler its important that a process being
woken for IO is run ASAP. It is realy up to the process scheduler
to hash out the policy here, just keep in mind that this is an
important metric.
If the scheduler / CPU can't keep up, then AS's heuristic should
kick in quickly.

No need! Just keep in mind that newly waking processes are important.
Not just for disk but any sort of IO: network, soundcard buffers, etc.
