Ok, I picked up some SATA hard drives now, and the AHCI driver DOES see them.
However, it gets more interesting now.
The board has 4 SATA ports.
In the BIOS, all 4 of them work, and can start the bootloader from any
of them.
In the kernel, ONLY the first two ports work.
The only thing I see on this, is that in my original dmesg, when the DVD
drive was connected to the 4th port, and nothing connected on SATA1-3,
SControl was 300 for 1/2 and 0 for 3/4.
libata version 2.00 loaded.
