The first thing to note is about the specs and the pre-production
hardware: the Linux Foundation has mechanism to get both into the hands
of interested developers; if you can point me to contacts, I can at
least get the NDA documentation programme ball rolling.

The first thing I really noted is that SMP and STP protocol support is
stubbed out ... you really can't do anything other than direct device
connection without them.

That's not such a bad way of doing it ... it pretty much mimics the wire
protocol, which is simply frame in/frame out for SAS.

I also note there's a slight nomenclature issue which will trip up SAS
people.  All through the driver, you seem to use the word "port" to
refer to a physical phy.  the struct bs_port seems to actually be a phy
descriptor ... unless there's some missing phy<->port setup logic that
will be in the final driver?  The trouble is that phys and ports are
distinct (and not equivalent) objects in SAS.

If you have a contact here too, I can get the LF NDA and hardware
programmes rolling.
