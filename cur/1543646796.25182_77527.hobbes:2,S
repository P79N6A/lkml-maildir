Readahead isn't the only problem, but it is a huge problem.  The current 
readahead model is per-inode, which is very little help with lots of small 
files, especially if they are fragmented or out of order.  There are various 
ways to fix this; they are all difficult[1].  Fortunately, we can call this 
"tuning work" so it can be done during the stable series.
[1] We could teach each filesystem how to read ahead across directories, or 
we could teach the vfs how to do physical readahead.  Choose your poison.
