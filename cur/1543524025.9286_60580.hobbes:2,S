Register allocation is only really relevant for any of the modern x86s
in as much as it's used to reduce instruction count, footprint and so
on.
On Crusoe I guess the cost of redundant instructions is not so
significant once they've been through a translation pass, but for those
instruction streams getting interpreted, and for the speed of
translation itself, it still makes sense to keep the number of
instructions (and their size) to a minimum.

I wouldn't be surprised if inlining is less important.  Crusoe is a sort
of JIT and would seem well placed to auto-inline things in the
appropriate, dynamically determined manner.

A lot of nasty arch-specific stuff is there to fit the x86 instruction
set :-)  Still it works out in the end, and as compiler technology
improves we're seeing it's not intrinsically that hard, it's just very
complicated.
