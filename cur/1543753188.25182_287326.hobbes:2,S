Periodically can also mean a buffer start call back from relayfs 
(although that would mean the first entry is not guaranteed) or a 
(per cpu) eventcnt from the subsystem. The amount of needed search would 
be limited. The main point is from the relayfs POV the buffer structure 
has always the same (simple) structure.
You have to be more specific, what's so special about this amount of data. 
You likely want to (incrementally) build an index file, so you don't have 
to repeat the searches, but even with your current format you would 
benefit from such an index file.

Why is it "totally unrealistic"?

Actually that would be already too much for low level kernel debugging.
Why do you want to put this into relayfs?
What are the _specific_ reasons you need these various modes, why can't 
you build any special requirements on top of a very light weight relay 
mechanism?
