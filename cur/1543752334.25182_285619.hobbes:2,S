Hallo,
As some people already noticed 2.6.10rc1 unfortunately has broken
NUMA support on x86-64. The problem is a fallout from the recent
nodemask changes, which didn't really work well.
The following four patches fix the known problems.
Linus, please apply them. 
Anybody who uses a multi CPU Opteron system with 2.6.10rc1 should
apply them too or disable CONFIG_NUMA.
