This patch is broken since it replaces several loops that iterate NR_CPUS
times with for_each_cpu before cpu_possible_map is setup:

The old comment indicates it: called before smp_prepare_cpus gets called
which sets up cpu_possible_map.

Same here.
I didn't check the rest, but it looks like we end up with a bit of
uninitialized stuff.
