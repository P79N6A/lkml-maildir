Hi Michael!
It's a problem with your BIOS. There is no way to set the video modes unless
you use local memory or 8mb stolen since the setmode BIOS calls checks
whether the mode can fit in the stolen memory, whether you populated the GTT
with extra pages or not.
It is therefore a OEM BIOS problem. Dell was notified about this a long time
ago - I thought they fixed it in the mean time. Try moaning about this to
Asus as well...
