If you think the information is of interest to the list, I have no
problem with continueing our dialog there.
Embedded text or URLs, whichever is easier for you is fine by me.

Could you, by chance, have a 440GX based system, perhaps even an Intel
Lancewood MB?  If this is the case, your problem has to do with the PCI
IRQ table on the MB and/or how Linux now interprets it (Alan Cox or Doug
Ledford may have more info on this issue since they have been tracking
it for RedHat).  A possible work around is to enable APIC I/O.
If you don't have such a system, can you provide the full dmesg as
well as lspci output for your system.  That combined with the driver
messages should help me figure this out.
