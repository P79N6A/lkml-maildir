  I would say it is SOLELY because we are quite good at it.
  Some insidious small surprises get thru every now and then,
  and we really can't block them all without endangering the
  freedom of dogfight (in between on-topic things) at the list.
  If you are PERL speaker (or can at least comprehend perl's
  m(atch) expressions), here is URL to info about it, plus
  the actual live running filter-set:
    
http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html
  Go to the end of the page, and you see link for the actual
  filter code used at the VGER's Majordomo.
  I can only hope that when a legitimate posting goes to list-owner
  approval, the list-owner would either approve the thing, or inform
  the message originator that they had used tabooed expressions, and
  should avoid it in the future to get thru.
  (I get a lot of junk,  linux-kernel-owner gets A LOT MORE ...)
