	Yep.

	That looks like a *receive* queue to me. We were talking about selecting
for writes, weren't we.

	Looks like another receive queue to me. There is no send queue and you
wouldn't want there to be one.

	They have device queues, they have no socket send queues.

	It is relevent. Because when you select for write, you're trying to find
out whether there's space to write to the socket. That would require there
to be something for there to be space in or not to be space in. Whatever you
want to call that (I call it a 'socket send queue', but it doesn't matter)
that queue doesn't exist for UDP and you wouldn't want it to exist.
	With UDP, or any connectionless protocol, the application is ultimately
responsible for transmit pacing. You could argue that it would be nice if
the kernel helped out more than it currently does, but it has no obligation
to do so.
