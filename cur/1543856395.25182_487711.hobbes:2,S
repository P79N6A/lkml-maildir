Try it and see.  You have to turn on CONFIG_USB_SUSPEND.
You also have to have autosuspend support in all the USB drivers for the
attached devices.  Right now autosuspend is present only in the host
controller drivers and the hub driver -- it is not available in USBHID
(under development).  But if you have a USB device with no driver bound,
or you unload its driver, then the device will automatically be suspended.
