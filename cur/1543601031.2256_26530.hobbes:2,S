Hi!
This is a bunch of patches to make most of the drivers in Linux kernel
compile on the AMD SledgeHammer (x86-64) platform. Most of them are not
x86-64 specific and are general fixes that are needed anyway.
All the patches are generated against x86-64 2.4.9 tree, but were tested
that they apply with some minor offsets to 2.4.10-pre8 as well.
This first patch is a fix for the AIC-7xxx driver to fix the #include it
uses for endianity stuff.
