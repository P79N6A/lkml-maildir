I think that could *work*, but I still think it is a heuristics change
rather than a bug fix.
Do we want everyone to make some progress, even if that means having
some do some swapping and others not; or have the zone pressure (and
tendancy to swap) depend on how well progress is going, globally?
The latter is what we have now, and I don't think it is terrible (not
saying your idea can't work better, but it would need careful
consideration).
Coming from another angle, I am thinking about doing away with direct
reclaim completely. That means we don't need any GFP_IO or GFP_FS, and
solves the problem of large numbers of processes stuck in reclaim and
skewing aging and depleting the memory reserve.
But that's tricky because we don't have enough kswapds to get maximum
reclaim throughput on many configurations (only single core opterons
and UP systems, really).
