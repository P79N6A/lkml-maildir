Hello
Now i am using kernel-2.6.10 in my fedora core 2 machine, i have 
downloaded the kernel-2.6.11-rc2 then created the default config file 
and i run the make command , it compiled all the kernel modules then i 
run the make modules , it shows some few lines and terminate the process 
so i am not able to make the kernel modules.After i switch over the 
kernel 2.6.5-1.358 that is default kernel in fedora core 2, this time i 
am able to make and install the kernel modules without any problem, 
anybody tell me what is the problem in that place
