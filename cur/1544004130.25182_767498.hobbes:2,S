+5. Hierarchy support
+
+The memory controller supports a deep hierarchy and hierarchical accounting.
+The hierarchy is created by creating the appropriate cgroups in the
+cgroup filesystem. Consider for example, the following cgroup filesystem
+hierarchy
+
+		root
+	     /  |   \
+           /	|    \
+	  a	b	c
+			| \
+			|  \
+			d   e
+
+In the diagram above, with hierarchical accounting enabled, all memory
+usage of e, is accounted to its ancestors up until the root (i.e, c and root),
+that has memory.use_hierarchy enabled.  If one of the ancestors goes over its
+limit, the reclaim algorithm reclaims from the tasks in the ancestor and the
+children of the ancestor.
+
+5.1 Enabling hierarchical accounting and reclaim
+
+The memory controller by default disables the hierarchy feature. Support
+can be enabled by writing 1 to memory.use_hierarchy file of the root cgroup
+
+# echo 1 > memory.use_hierarchy
+
+The feature can be disabled by
+
+# echo 0 > memory.use_hierarchy
+
+NOTE1: Enabling/disabling will fail if the cgroup already has other
+cgroups created below it.
+
+NOTE2: This feature can be enabled/disabled per subtree.
+
 5. TODO
 
 1. Add support for accounting huge pages (as a separate controller)
