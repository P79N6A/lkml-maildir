Sam, Magnus: 
I'm dense.  Why do we want to run modpost if we are building a kernel
that doesn't support modules?
I haven't mucked with modpost at all so I don't have a good feel for
what it does, or why we want to run it.
My quick skimming says modpost is all about generating the module
version symbol scrambling.  Which if that is all it does means it is
senseless to run this without modules.
