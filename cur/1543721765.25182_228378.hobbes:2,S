Yes, it can be cleaner, but it's not something I would say is
completely broken with the DMA API.  It does provide a way to
make your device specific implementation, regardless of whether
it's managed ideally via a struct device pointer.  Migrating to
dev->dma* sounds suspiciously like a 2.7ism.

A struct device argument to page_to_dma seems like a no brainer to be
included.

Ahh, ok.  Deepak and I have discussed this idea F2F on a several
occassions, I recall he needed it for the small floating PCI window
he has to manage on the IXP* ports.  It may help in some embedded
PPC areas as well.

I see that's somewhat like what David Brownell suggested before...a single
pointer to a set of dma ops from struct device.  hppa_dma_ops translated
into a generic dma_ops entity with fields corresponding to existing
DMA API calls would be a good starting point. We can get rid of some
address translation hacks in a lot of custom embedded PPC drivers
with something like this.
