First, you can try s2ram if you haven't done it already (
http://en.opensuse.org/s2ram
).
It may help to get your video back after the resume.
If you have a COM port, it is also possible to use a serial console throughout the
suspend/resume cycle.

This looks like an ACPI-vs-IDE problem.  You can try to use libata drivers instead
of the "old IDE" ones.

I'm not an ACPI expert, it won't tell me a lot, but perhaps you should add
linux-acpi to the Cc list. ;-)

I think it's better to try the -mm with the minimal config.
