I can add this.

I will this as is right now, probably Lauri can explain if there is
some other way possible to pass it using platform hook if it is
specific to particular board design.

This looks like bug. I will change data to u8. Lauri please confirm.

As per this bits_per_word and length we have 4 messages of 24 bits
each, and so it is job of omap2_mcspi_txrx_pio in
drivers/spi/omap2_mcspi.c to handle this messages and proper order.
AFAIR, OMAP2 mcspi block has registers settings for this byte-order
stuf. Lauri could you please add some points here. I don't have access
to OMAP2 TRM anymore. Thanks.
