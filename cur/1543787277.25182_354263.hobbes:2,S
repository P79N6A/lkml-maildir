Bogus patch!  I was just getting lucky and not running PnP BIOS code on 
the AP's -- until now.  Turns out the fix and the bug were much 
simpler.  Please apply this instead.
PnP BIOS for x86 is part of drivers, so I missed it in the initial
GDT page alignment patch.  Kudos to Andrew for fixing that.
Unfortunately, fixing the build introduced a kernel panic when
trying to setup the as of yet unallocated GDTs for the APs.
I totally misdiagnosed this.  The problem happens only
when NR_CPUS > physical CPUs.  Fix is to ignore missing GDT's.
