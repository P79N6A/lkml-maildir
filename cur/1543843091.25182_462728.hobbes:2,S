I can't reproduce your results here with my configuration.  I used 
2.6.18-rc6-mm2 instead of -mm1 but I don't think that should matter.
(It's also a little awkward to try.  My system has the annoying habit of 
waking up from suspend-to-RAM with the screen non-functional.  No doubt a 
BIOS problem.)
Please try this again after setting CONFIG_USB_DEBUG.  It's hard to say 
anything definite without more debugging info.
