Hi,
I've observed a possible problem with create_proc_entry and 
!CONFIG_PROC_FS.
If !CONFIG_PROC_FS include/linux/proc_fs.h includes a dummy 
create_proc_entry that simply returns NULL.
Unfortunately, many callers of this function do things like e.g.
static int __init br2684_init(void)
{
        struct proc_dir_entry *p;
        if ((p = create_proc_entry("br2684", 0, atm_proc_root)) == NULL)
                return -ENOMEM;
        p->proc_fops = &br2684_proc_operations;
        br2684_ioctl_set(br2684_ioctl);
        return 0;
}
IOW, the dummy create_proc_entry fixes the compilation but the init 
function always returns -ENOMEM if !CONFIG_PROC_FS.
Is there any better solution than removing the dummy create_proc_entry 
and #ifdef'ing all places where it's used?
