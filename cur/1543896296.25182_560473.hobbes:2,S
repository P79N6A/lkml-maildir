On what grounds would Oracle have a license to ship that part of
Linux?  Unless you are the sole copyright owner, you have no right to
copy a given piece of software _at all_ without a license.  The GPL is
a remarkably giving license in terms of how little it requires.
(This potentially wide scope is one of the major reasons that the GPL
mentions "mere aggregation" and that the Debian Free Software
Guidelines' include guideline #9.)

When distributions generate checksums (as opposed to signatures) over
images, they do provide all of the inputs.  When most distributions
provide signatures, the signatures do not function as statements or
instructions to computers -- they function as statements to users.
Tivo's digital signatures differ in both of these respects.
