Thanks for the info.
Hmmm... Let this `slotting' be a bit smarter in some later chip and issue
will come again. The change seems to appear in linux-2.2.14 which has been
available in January IIRC. This explains that still most actually used
distributions haven't it yet. 
Btw, how does this trick victimize the BOGOMIPS result? I don't care that
much about this number, but it seems numerous people are very sensitive to
it and it may happen customers they will get or not depending on this
bogus number being comfortably high or not. ;-) 
Gérard.
