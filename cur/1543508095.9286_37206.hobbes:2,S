We do, however, correctly set the archive bit whenever we modify or create 
a file on a FAT filesystem, so it should be usable for its intended purpose.
You just need to make sure your backup program uses the ATTR_ARCH flags to
decide whether to back up each file, and resets the flag after^Wbefore doing
the backup.
This doesn't help you much if you're backing up over NFS, but if you're 
exporting FAT over NFS, you're probably screwed anyway.
