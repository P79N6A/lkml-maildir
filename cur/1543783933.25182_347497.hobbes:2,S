Hi Andrew,
Thanks for the reply, and sorry for the delay in response.
It turns out that I think it's an error on my end.  The kernel didn't
actually crash, it just doesn't print anything to the screen after the
lines I pasted.  It appears to boot normally after that.
My guess is some sort of console handler is missing, I will try to figure
out what that might be.
Sorry for the false alarm.
Moses
