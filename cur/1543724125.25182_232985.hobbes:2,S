include/linux/compiler-gcc3.h says:
<--  snip  -->
#if __GNUC_MINOR__ >= 1  && __GNUC_MINOR__ < 4
# define inline         __inline__ __attribute__((always_inline))
# define __inline__     __inline__ __attribute__((always_inline))
# define __inline       __inline__ __attribute__((always_inline))
#endif
<--  snip  -->
