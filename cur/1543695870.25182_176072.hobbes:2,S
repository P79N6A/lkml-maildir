Yeah... in my experience, the whole ac'97 deal is pretty buggy (for one 
thing, with both ALSA and OSS drivers, output is distorted unless I keep the 
volume below ~70%...).  But as I said, the skipping only happens when the 
memory is full, or getting close to full.  If I select specific albums to 
play instead of using my random function, I can usually play a few albums 
and there aren't any skips, not until the memory gets pretty full.

4G!! (Note to self: s/ffffffff/0000ffff/...)  Thanks a lot, I'll give this a 
try.  It certainly works here on my home system.
