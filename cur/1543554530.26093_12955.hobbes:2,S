I wouldn't swear it was Marc, but I do remember seeing a thread in which
someone did confirm this. Jeff posted an example code segment which would
generate an AGI, and gcc generated a lot of code like this (i.e. it doesn't
avoid generating AGIs). Someone (Marc??) supported this.
He didn't state directly "gcc code produces lots of AGIs", but did say that gcc
generated a lot of code which, according to Jeff, produces AGIs.
