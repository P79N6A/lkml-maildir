Thanks to point this. Is it already included in Linus' git tree?

Well, the test application just use an exaggerated way to replicate the issue.
Actually, In the real work, the application such as mplayer, asterisk,
etc will run into
the above problem when run them at the second time. I think I have no
reason to modify those kind of applications.
My patch let kernel drop VFS cache in the low memory situation when
the application requests more memory allocation, I don't think it's
luck. You know, the application just wants to allocate 8
1Mbyte-blocks(order =9) and releasing VFS cache we can get almost
50Mbyte free memory.
The patch indeedly enabled many failed test cases on our side. But
yes, I don't think it's the final solution. I'll try Mel's patch and
update the results.
Thanks,
