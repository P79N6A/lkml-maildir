This is a bug in pppd or the linux kernel.
Can the linux kernel handle un-numbered Point-to-Point links?
This is a point-to-point link, so we should ignore the remote IP 
address, and add local routes (e.g. default route) pointing to interface 
names, and not IP addresses.
I agree that it would have looked prettier if the remote end used 
something other than 255.255.255.255, but pppd should not care about it, 
so who cares what number it is.
I do not know if this is a bug in the linux kernel, or just pppd.
