I'm unable to duplicate this (the current 0.19 driver doesn't hang at all on 
me now under any of my tests).  Try to find a way to duplicate it (either by 
playing a specific wav file using the play command, or by doing something in 
particular to make artsd do it, or something else).  If you can find a way 
to duplicate it, then I can see about getting a proper fix for it.
