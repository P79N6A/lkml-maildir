As it has been said, this could be  due  to  just  a
poor quality crystal. In addition, non  temperature-
controlled  crystals  are  far  more  efficient   as
thermometers than as oscillators,  as  frequency  is
directly and more than  significantly  depending  on
crystal temperature.
Now if you think there  is  a  real  software  issue
behind your observations, it wont be  that  easy  to
distinguish between crystal and soft  contributions,
unless the specifications of  the  crystal  used  on
those boards are far better than the  drifts  you
observed.
If the specs are of the same order, I think reliable
conclusions can only arise from tests issued on  the
same physical hardware.
