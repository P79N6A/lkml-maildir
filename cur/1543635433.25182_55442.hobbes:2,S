I certainly am flatterred :) 
But basically what Alexander Viro said is all true.  The other problem that he didn't mention was that I don't see how checkers can be built to handle loops.  In writing smatch I just ignore loops altogether.
For now I just take the quick and dirty approach.  Also smatch really isn't finished yet.  I worked on it for a half hour tonight and fixed the bugs with the lock_kernel check.  Tomorrow I'll maybe add support for while, for, switch and break statements.
regards,
dan carpenter
