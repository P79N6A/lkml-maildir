It looks bogus.  Are you sure that listening socket is not garbage at that
point in your testcase?
Your patch is definitely wrong - consider the case when we send fd1 to
ourselves (fd2 would be receiving end), then send fd2 (fd3 would be
receiving end), then close fd3.  We want _both_ packets (carrying fd1
and fd2 resp.) to be taken out of queues in that loop.  So added check
is broken.
We scan the queues of listening sockets, all right, but only if listening
socket itself becomes a garbage.  I.e. only if connection is never going
to be accepted...
