Agree, and I think we're not far.  By "secure" you mean "robust"
right?

The data can be kept in data structures private to the instrumentation
module.  Instead of growing the base structure, you have a lookup
table indexed by a key of the base structure.  In the lookup table,
you store whatever you would need: timestamps, whatnot.

In systemtap, it is routine to store such intermediate data in kernel
space, and process it into aggregate statistics on demand, still in
kernel space.  User space need only see finished results.  This part
is not complicated.
