This is going to have a lot of ripple effect throughout the Linux
community in that game developers will quite possibly have the ability
to do low latency OpenGL, frame accurate video and other things along
those lines. The previous Linux kernels without these mods couldn't
allow this level of temporal precious for application developers. It's
going to push applications like jackd and others in ways that will
flush out bugs and general techniques that aren't typically apart of
a proper RT applications.
We have the possibility of providing a first class gaming platform and
other things, that Longhorn can't beging to touch if the middleware
falls into place. :)
