If it were under general setup, you'd have to enter fs to select tmpfs,
enter general setup to replace ramfs, and re-enter fs to disable ramfs.
I consider making people do that to be an evil deed.
The current position is very convenient, ramfs is below tmpfs, and while you
go from top to the bottom, you can enable tmpfs, tmpfs-replaces-ramfs and
ramfs=n.

Sounds reasonable.

I tested =m, found it not to compile because of a nonexported __symbol
and decided it wasn't worth the effort of adding another export while
other people struggle to reduce their number.

Which is obviously a bad thing for my cause, but good if you'd boot a
normal system. Is there any way out?

No, I had left it there accidentially. Your comment tells me it was ment to
happen.
