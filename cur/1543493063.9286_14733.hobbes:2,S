If the file just holds the capability-validation timestamp, I'd just need
to make that later than the time the system is booted. The kernel won't be
any wiser. And it also means that my executable checked yesterday won't run
today because the system rebooted. Or the system checks _all_ files for
capability timestamps on boot.
If you want to validate, you have to have a _trusted_ source for the data
against which to check. The file itself might forge whatever you check
somehow, so it's out. Only possibility remaining is a fully
kernel-controlled data structure: Either the filesystem or a
kernel-internal structure holding the capabilities and the open files in
the VMS manner.

e3fsck(8), validation in mount(8).

Yep. That capability is called "x" bit in Unix.

No. You need to check it _each_ time the system boots with your scheme. For
_all_ files. Or keep a list of capable files around (i.e., VMS).

Great. "Any Perl script that states `I've got capability A' is now
capable?! You _seriously_ suggest to trust the Perl (and sh, and ...)
interpreters?

An idealistic pessimist: The idea of capabilities was designed to be able
to build _more_ secure systems. To be able to do that in practice, you
_have_ to play by the capability rules, else the whole system is liable to
be the victim of as yet undiscovered attacks. This means capabilities in
filesystem or centrally in the kernel a la VMS. Building a
halfway-capability system just invites disaster when the true and the faked
get mixed later on.
Any capability system means a lot of rework in the userland, no way around
it. Any kludge that promises to "fix" that is broken by its very objectives.

But you have to keep your goal in mind, and be careful not to go down a
road that doesn't allow you to reach it.

Other way around: If you can do something like that _without_ capability
aware tools, the system is irrecoverably broken: This allows faking and
smuggling capabilities.

I'm not so sure... I _like_ Unix, and a pure caps system is _not_ Unix in
any reasonable meaning of the term.

A hybrid scheme that _allows_ us to get there. Or a complete rewrite of the
userland.

Show me _one_ system run by a security concisious sysadmin that runs 1.2.x
and 2.0.x alternatively. Note that there are _no_ huge security risks
involved there!
