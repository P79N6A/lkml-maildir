With the latest backed you need to update include/sane/sanei_usb.h and 
sanei/sanei_usb.c from my SVN repository (will go into SANE CVS in the 
next day).

Don't ever use hpusbscsi. I though I already told all vedors it is that 
broken that they should never ever ship it. It is the first thing that 
will be removed in Linux 2.7.
If it would be me it would be removed from _all kernels right now_ ...

find /lib/modules -name hpusbscsi.*o | xargs rm -fv
(or so - assuming no spaces in filenames ...)
and build the backend with the updated sanei_usb* files. Or 
alternatively use a avision backed that is two weeks old (man svn) which 
does not need the updated sanei functionality.
Yours,
