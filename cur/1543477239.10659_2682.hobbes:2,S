------------
We're using const pointers and inline function in the kernel already
(supposed by GCC).  The question then is the rest of the features worth
the conversion cost to C++; I myself am not convinced.
------------
 here is a point.
One thing is to make kernel c++ compilable. That would be a waste
the other thing is to make kernel headers c++ compatible.
well, at least to reasonable extent.
the point is: it doesn't cost much, why not to do it ?
currently people can not, reasonably, compile their own C++ modules.
