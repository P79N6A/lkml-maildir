As I already said in this thread:
  The currently used file for gcc 4 is compiler-gcc+.h, not
  compiler-gcc3.h .
And the current setup is to have one file for every major number of gcc.
I have no strong opinion whether this approach or the approach of one 
file for all gcc versions is better - but with the current approach, 
everything else than a separate file for gcc 4 wasn't logical.
I can offer the following choices:
- please apply this compiler-gcc4.h patch
- let me send a patch merging all compiler-gcc*.h files into one
  compiler-gcc.h file
- let me send a patch merging all compiler-gcc*.h files back into 
  compiler.h
