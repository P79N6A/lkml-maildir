The current slab wont do that unless you allocate enough entries so 
that a new page is retrieved from the page allocator. Then you may have 
local memory from the slab (if the memory policy is not on round robin).
If you allocate some slab entries on one node then you typically have a 
partially used page from that node. If you then switch to a different 
processor on a different node and then use the slab allocator to get an 
entry for that slab then that partially used page will be used! The
slab allocator will return an entry from the *prior* node.

The slab allocator uses alloc_pages and alloc_pages_node
