It's my fault. At least the the problem about the disk not spinning down. 
The driver core code was changed in 2.5.44 to call ->shutdown() instead of 
->remove() during system power transitions, and none of the drivers got 
converted over before 2.5.44 went out. I'm really sorry about this, and I 
sincerely hope that it hasn't bitten any too bad.. 
Concerning the actual shutdown, I'm simply calling the ide driver's 
->standby() method. At least in the case of ide disks, there is a call in 
the driver's ->cleanup() method to flush the cache. Should this be 
moved to ->standby()? Or, should we call ->flushcache() for all drives 
from ->shutdown()? 
Initial patch appended.
Thanks,
