Actually I probably would see it, just a little later.
Also I'm maintainer for swsusp. I tend to look after s2ram, too, so
cc-ing me will not hurt, but I do not maintain it.
Best place to ask is probably suspend-devel mailing list at
sourceforge's suspend project.

Actually I prefer 'simple' bugs to go via mail to suspend-devel... and
keep bugzilla for 'interesting' issues.
