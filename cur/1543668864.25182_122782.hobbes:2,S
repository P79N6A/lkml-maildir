Speaking of the exploit fix: Since I run a kernel which has it
installed, I can no longer strace processes which do run as root but
have a gid sbit set, e.g.
# ls -la /tmp/bash 
-rwxr-sr-x    1 root     smmsp      541096 Apr  5 10:21 /tmp/bash
# id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root),1(bin),2(daemon),3(sys),4(adm),6(disk),10(wheel)
# /tmp/bash
bash-2.05a# echo $$
2625
(in another shell)
# strace -f -p 2625
trace: ptrace(PTRACE_SYSCALL, ...): Operation not permitted
detach: ptrace(PTRACE_DETACH, ...): Operation not permitted
but the shell with the pid of 2625 is now "dead" until one sends it a 
SIGCONT:
# kill -CONT 2625
(other shell now works again)
% uname -an
Linux henning-pc 2.4.18-27.7.x #1 Fri Mar 14 06:44:53 EST 2003 i686 unknown
I'm running the most current strace (4.4.94) because of the STOP/CONT
problems before (RH bugzilla #64303, #75709) but this is new after
installing the exploit fix.
(I found this BTW trying to trace sendmail that's why I have that test
case with setgid to smmsp).
	Regards
