No, it shouldn't be hard to change. In fact, we've had to think of
changing it for 2.5 anyhow, since most likely we can't afford bio
alloc's happening under the covers down that path.

Yes, I think Kiobufs can go, and we can use something like kvecs
(from aio code base) instead which are better for representing 
readv/writev, for the generic case (i.e. when its not just
for block i/o). Its easy enough to map kvecs into bio s or
zero-copy networking.
