Although it may be a month or three until 2.6.0-final, here is an update
to Documentation/Changes and scripts/ver_linux for nfs-utils.
Your information should be preserved somewhere, and
Documentation/Changes should be one of first places people look when
moving from 2.4 to 2.6.
I moved the nfs-utils table entry up a couple of rows to group it with
other network related items.
If this patch looks OK, please send it upstream.  Otherwise, please fix
and send.

 Kernel compilation

 Due to changes in the length of the phone number field, isdn4k-utils
 needs to be recompiled or (preferably) upgraded.
 
+NFS-utils
+---------
+
+In 2.4 and earlier kernels, the nfs server needed to know about any
+client that expected to be able to access files via NFS.  This
+information would be given to the kernel by "mountd" when the client
+mounted the filesystem, or by "exportfs" at system startup.  exportfs
+would take information about active clients from /var/lib/nfs/rmtab.
+
+This approach is quite fragile as it depends on rmtab being correct
+which is not always easy, particularly when trying to implement
+fail-over.  Even when the system is working well, rmtab suffers from
+getting lots of old entries that never get removed.
+
+With 2.6 we have the option of having the kernel tell mountd when it
+gets a request from an unknown host, and mountd can give appropriate
+export information to the kernel.  This removes the dependency on
+rmtab and means that the kernel only needs to know about currently
+active clients.
+
+To enable this new functionality, you need to:
+
+  mount -t nfsd nfsd /proc/fs/nfs
+
+before running exportfs or mountd.  It is recommended that all NFS
+services be protected from the internet-at-large where that is possible.
