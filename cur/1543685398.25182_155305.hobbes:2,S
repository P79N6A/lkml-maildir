Some (all?) PCI add-in cards leave this up to the OS/driver as well.  
The card I have has no firmware on board, and from a quick look at the 
PCI1031 datasheet, I can't see any easy way of adding one.  The default 
power-on state (at least for the PCI1031) is to disable all interrupts.

I think it should be possible to use the IRQMUX, and other registers to 
work out whether the bridge has been setup or not..  e.g.
"device control register bits2,1:  R/W, Interrupt mode.
Bits 2 1 select the interrupt mode used by the PCI1031. Bits 2 1 are 
encoded as: 00 = No interrupts enabled (default) 01 = ISA 10 = 
Serialized IRQ type interrupt scheme 11 = Reserved"
If these bits are non-zero, I suppose we should probably leave the IRQ 
routing registers alone, as it would seem to be a good indicator that 
the BIOS has programmed these for us.  This is just on the 1031, 
however, I haven't checked any of the other datasheets...
Tim.
