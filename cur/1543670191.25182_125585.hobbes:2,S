We are currently using the EMC approved 6.04-fo qla2300 driver with great
success.  With multiple connections to a CX600 fail over occurs properly, it
also does failover for the tape drives, and the system has been running for
about 40 days without any problems...
YMMV, but for us it has been working quite well.
