Well Henning, question is: did you jump from W95/98 to XP? You should have
followed the product flow according to the vendor:
W95->W98->NT3->NT4->W2K->XP
Have you tried your apps on NT3/NT4? If they didn't work back _then_ you
probably have exchanged them back then - which was the original intention of
the whole story.
As you may remember the licenses were just adjusted to _prevent_ people from
upgrading "multi-hop", why do you think they did that?
Regards,
Stephan
