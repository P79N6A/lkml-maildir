Not true!  It is perfectly legal on a large number of platforms to
explicitly mmap something at the address 0, at which point dereferencing
a null pointer is exactly like dereferencing any other pointer on the
heap.  Doing so is not recommended except in a few special cases for
emulators and such, but it works to some extent.
