	As this thread becomes too large I'm appending some
URLs. I don't know what patches you are using and what settings
you have. If you still have problems feel free to contact me directly.
The usage is simple: mark device "lo" as hidden and put there only
local addresses that must not advertised.
The "hidden" device's home page:
