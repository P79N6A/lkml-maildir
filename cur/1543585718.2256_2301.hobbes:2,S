Aggh!  I feel like I'm in a comedy sketch.  You tell me "do that".  
I do that.  You tell me, "you should try this instead", so I do this.
Then, you tell me, "but you should really do the other."
You're the one who suggested "gtk--" as a test case.  Built out of the
box, it uses "-O2".  If there were magical settings or sekret
incantations, I wish you'd mentioned them when you suggested it.

If something has a cost, even a little cost, and no one can find a
benefit, then implementing it is not "obviously" a good idea.  That's
why Linus asked for a real-world example before he spent time
complicating the algorithms and adding checks that incur a cost for
every process, even those that won't get any benefit.

Yes.  Zach's explanation is the first thing I've seen that makes a
case for some benefit (besides babysitting GCC 2.96) without
conflicting with the data I'm getting.
As I've noted elsewhere, I see no change at all in system time for GCC
3.0 between 2.4.2 and 2.4.3-pre7.  Given Zach's explanation, I'm
prepared to believe there might be a difference with, say, a 500meg
arena (or perhaps something as small as a 100meg arena).

For my test cases under 3.0, it looks like 70 times zero.  However,
I'm now prepared to believe that it could be 70 times something
non-zero for certain very hairy source files.
