Well it would be for a quite specialized limited use case: 
- Memory the kernel doesn't need to map (after all kmap is evil) 
- You need more than 500MB or so.
- 32bit kernel and user cannot run 64bit kernel
- Machine has >3GB of RAM 
Is there clear evidence that is a common issue? If it is just a "would
be nice to have in theory" the cost of doing a GFP_DMA32 for i386 would be
probably not worth doing it. If it's a common issue it might be 
considered, although the "here's a nickle. buy yourself a 64bit CPU"
strategy would also sound attractive. 
Please give a very very strong rationale why you want it. Did you actually
run into such a situation yourself yet?
