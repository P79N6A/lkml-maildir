I am starting to hate the poor factoring of all of this stuff 
in the kernel.
kernel/power/poweroff.c re-implements the wheel it comes to doing
poweroff a system.  Instead of doing a graceful power off it
skips calling the powerdown notifer and calling device_shutdown.
Since I moved the acpi prepare for powerdown in device_shutdown
it makes sense that code path would now fail.
Do you know if there is any deliberate reason Alt-SysRq-O skips
doing a normal device shutdown work?
If not I think I will just extract a common factor from 
kernel/sys.c/sys_reboot(CMD_POWER_OFF);
And have both code paths call it.
