You have a good point I can't deny that. But what I'm looking is logic
splitting of the tar-ball. The server/workstation thing was just a
suggestion. Here's another suggestion :)
The source tree has a logic build up right now couldn't one use
that? So you got the scsi src in one tar-ball the ide in one and network
in another?
