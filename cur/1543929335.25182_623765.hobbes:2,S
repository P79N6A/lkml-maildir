Well the majority of C syntax requires no runtime library.  There are
some system call like things that you often want that need a library
(like malloc and such), but those aren't really part of C itself.  Of
course without malloc and printf and file i/o calls the program would
probably be a bit boring.  I have written some small C programs without
a runtime, where the few things I needed where implemented in assembly
and poked the hardware directly and called from the C program.

As a programming language, C leaves much to be desired.
