So then:  xawtv4 (dvb-app) works with hw:0 but not with 1.0.9's dmix default.
It works with /dev/dsp1 (usb-speakers) but not with /dev/dsp0 (atiixp ac'97).
vdr's softdevice (another dvb-app) works with dmix-default but not with hw:0.
And that's my experience with most audio apps - you have to try all configur-
ations until you find one that works.  Sure, maybe badly written apps but
there must be something wrong if so many developers have problems with
Alsa.  I've even resigned to grok the config files :-(
Ciao, ET.
And btw, with 2.6.15 the usb-speakers only produce noise most of the time.
