What do folks think about the attached patch, then?
Linus was making noises that he wishes to throttle "cleanups",
and this is a cleanup. But still... It's contained in arch code.
I'm pretty sure I can slip it in quietly if there's a sense
it is likely to save us the same problem in the future.
Also, I hate "<=" irrationally for some reason. I always
use "<" and ">=". This has something to do with programming
in pseudo-code and compiling by hand. On some brain-dead CPUs
and with some data types it is a better comparison.
I'll replicate to s390 and see if s390 -S output changes
if the source level looks ok to Martin's & Ulrich's eyes.
