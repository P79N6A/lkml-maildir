Thank you.  However, this disk and cable have been in use in this raid set
without error for at least 6 months.  I just switched the cable on the
hp-366 in question to a brand new (unwrapped it) udma-66 cable and I still
see the same issue.
I was able to reproduce this behavior without using the RAID layer, though
not with nearly as much regularity:
[root@music /root]# cat whoa.sh
#!/bin/sh
for i in 1 2 3 4 5
do
  for z in hdb1 hdg1 hdf1 hdi1 hdm1 hdd1 hdo1 hdk1
  do
    dd if=/dev/$z of=/dev/null count=500000 2> /dev/null &
  done
  dd if=/dev/hdq1 count=500000 2> /dev/null | md5sum
done
[root@music /root]# ./whoa.sh

During my investigations I noticed that the HPT was sharing an IRQ with a
PDC controller.  Apparently, the HPT will always use PCI slot 3's IRQ.  I
had to pull my ethernet and move cards around, but I booted with nothing
sharing IRQ's in my system.  I conducted the same tests, with the same
results.  I still got corruption under heavy load with the HPT.
I noticed that there were some specific debug flags in the hpt-366 driver to
get more information, so I enabled them.  Here is the pruned dmesg output:

The driver is slowing down the drive because of an ASIC bug, according to
the source.  Is this the mode it is supposed to end up in? MW DMA 2?
