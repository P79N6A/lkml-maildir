Oh I certainly agree (and it appears that Roland agrees) that MSI works 
/somewhere/ on NV.  I give kudos to NV to working on forcedeth to make 
sure it works well with MSI.  But unfortunately NV was also in the bug 
report(s) linked.
Though OTOH, the driver wasn't calling pci_intx() nor setting irq flags 
correctly, so who knows.
