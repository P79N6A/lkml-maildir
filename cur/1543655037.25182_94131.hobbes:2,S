Yes and no.
Unix (and Linux) developers are far too concerned with clinging to the
30-year-old outdated POSIX standard, which creates numerous problems when
trying to advance new features.  For example, the POSIX standard is the
reason we have the three-by-three secure permissions on files (three users:
owner, group, everyone; three permissions: read, write, execute) instead of
Access Control Lists (ACL's).
This is not a design flaw per say, but let's face it: Unix would be a lot
more secure (and more flexible in it's security) with ACL's.
Microsoft Windows has had ACL's since 1991 (Windows NT 3.5?); that was 11
years ago.  Linux is just now developing ACL's in some of the beta kernels.
(By "Linux" I mean the official Linux kernel as distributed by
www.kernel.org not these stupid add-on's and patches released by
third-parties)
> I doubt there be any such errors (mistakes) if ANY
I don't know of any mistakes per say, but if I had to do it over again,
there's about a thousands things I'd do differently (preference in design
choices, not mistakes) especially not to cling so religiously to POSIX
compliance.
