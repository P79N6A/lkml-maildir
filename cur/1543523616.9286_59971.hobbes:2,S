No. I'm saying be careful what you allow from userspace :)

I did misread you. Soory about that. I agree with the idea of extra ioctls
to /dev/fb would be better. Their are two reason for the "trusting"
problem. The reason /dev/fb needs root is because of VT switching and
the ablity to mapping MMIO regions . Some cards are brain dead that they
mix mode setting registers with accel registers :( I have patches that
deal with this so /dev/fb will be safe in the future.
