Kernel code which uses FPU should call kernel_fpu_begin() before it
and kernel_fpu_end() after.  kernel_fpu_begin() is safe - it uses
fnsave or fxsave, both of which don't raise pending FPU exceptions.
Also fnsave performs implicit fninit, and fxsave is followed by
fnclex, which clears pending exceptions.
However, raid6_before_mmx() [drivers/md/raid6x86.h] seems to be buggy:
static inline void raid6_before_mmx(raid6_mmx_save_t *s)
{
	s->cr0 = raid6_get_fpu();
	asm volatile("fsave %0 ; fwait" : "=m" (s->fsave[0]));
}
fsave will raise pending exceptions (unlike fnsave).
