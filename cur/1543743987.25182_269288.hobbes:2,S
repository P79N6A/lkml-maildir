This has been fixed in the following releases:
bk-3.2.3
bk-3.2.2c
bk-3.2.2b
Correct usage is "bk diffs -up" which will get you unified + procedural diffs.
-p is currently a hack, it implies -u, but don't depend on that behaviour,
a future release does this correctly and if you teach your fingers that 
diffs -p is the same as diffs -up you'll get burned later.
