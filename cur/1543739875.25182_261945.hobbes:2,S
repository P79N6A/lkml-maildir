Subject: [PATCH] boot parameters: quoting of environment variables revisited
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/10/19/268

When passing boot parameters, they can be quoted as follows:
param="value"
Unfortunately, when passing environment variables this way, the
quoting causes confusion: in 2.6.7 (etc.), only the variable name
was placed in the environment, which caused it to be ignored.
I've sent a patch that adjusted the name, but this patch was
dropped. Instead, apparently a different fix was attempted in
2.6.9, but this now yields param="value in the environment (note
the embeded double quote), which isn't much better.
I've attached a patch for 2.6.9 that fixes this. This time, I'm
shifting the value. Maybe you like it better this way :-)
