Ah.. that explains it all, as I modified net/core/dev.c earlier today to
report the base_addr present in the net_device structure in the
sprintf_stats() which is responsible for the /proc/net/dev output --
and, what I got was:
0xf88fa000
where the ifmap structure returned by the SIOCGIFMAP ioctl contained a
base_addr saying:
0xa000
I did this ugly hack (WRT net/core/dev.c) since I discovered that the
net_device()'s base_addr was an unsigned long, while ifmap's base_addr
was an unsigned short - and indeed, just like you said, it's only the
base-address that's returned in the ifmap. :-)

Ah, I see! Thanks a lot for your help! :-)
