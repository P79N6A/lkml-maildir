This is an old problem. The proper fix is already implemented for
arch/powerpc and consist of having virtual irq numbers (which helps for
many other things anyway).
Support for 4xx platforms in arch/powerpc is starting to get in, pop on
linuxppc-dev@ozlabs.org where the patches are being posted and you are
welcome to give a hand porting more platforms over :-)
