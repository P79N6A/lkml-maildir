Hello,
  Just writing in to report a bug in 2.4.0-test12.
Hardware:
  PCI-Matrox_Mill
  PCI-Adaptec 39160 / 160M scsi card
  PCI-Generic TNT-2 card
  PCI-Sound blaster -128 (es1370)
CPU 21164a - Alpha
Problem:
  There is a race condition in the aic7xxxx driver that causes the 
kernel to lock up.
I don't have a kernel dump yet as the machine reported by it'self..
This problem has been easy to reproduce. ergo about 3 crashes a day.
Solution:
  Sync often and pray.
Misc:
  As soon as I get a real dump I will post a followup to this message.
