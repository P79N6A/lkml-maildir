John, as Andrew pointed out, we are missing some braces in an
inopportune location.  I think we need to refactor this code entirely,
to remove the access_ok() checks and use copy_{to,from}_user(), but we
can take this in the meantime since the patch is dead without it.
I'll take paper, please.  One brown paper bag right over my head.

ARE WE SERIOUS?
