Have you tried turning on the NMI watchdog (nmi_watchdog=1)?  It should 
be able to kick the machine out of the locked state, as these symptoms 
would hint at a spinlock deadlock with interrupts disabled.  Also, try 
to reproduce on the latest 2.4.33pre.  That said, for an io intensive 
workload like you're running, 2.6 is much better, especially for systems 
using highmem.
