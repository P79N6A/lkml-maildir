Do you happen to use the madwifi drivers? If you are you might be
affected by bad interaction from madwifi with laptop mode patches. This
has been reported to ubuntu in
https://bugzilla.ubuntu.com/show_bug.cgi?id=6108
Unfortunatly, the only known fix up to now is to disable either madwifi
oder laptop-mode. :(
I'm also affected by this bug, and find this very annoying. Please CC:
