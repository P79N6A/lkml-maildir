Only in name ? Tell that to the Debian Hurd project. Also people who routinely
boot between OS/2 and Linux or use ext2fs under Acorn RISCOS to share their
filestore would find "." missing a little inconvenient. Oh you can do it. 
Novell doesnt have a real "." and "..". The novell 3 bugs with . and ..
handling speak volumes for why this was a bad idea.

I have. A lot of what is going on now is right. The problem is there is a
Linus tendancy to go "No way ever" not "I can't see how we can do this 
cleanly". Linus Torvalds is not god, and pronouncing blindly from on high
is a bad idea.
You could much more productively have said
"Stephen please call it ext3 because ....."
"I can't see a way to use all 4Gig of memory so for now I'm working on the
 basis its not likely to occur"
Free Software works a darn sight better when the response to something is
not "No, go away" but "I don't believe you can do it, show me.."
Im sure the latter is what you really mean in mosty cases, but it doesn't
come across that way.
Personally I'm pretty sure that in 5 years time Linux will support very
large amounts of RAM, a lot of processors, direct DMA I/O on file systems 
concurrent writes to a file and journalling.
