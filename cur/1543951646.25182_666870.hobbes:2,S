Won't lockdep/irqtrace warn if that happens ? You don't yet have the
lockdep patches for ppc64 (I'm still trying to find out why they break
iSeries) but it should warn of such a spurrious IRQ enable on other
archs too... At least, from a quick look at the code, it -seems- that it
does have such a test.
Cheers,
Ben.
