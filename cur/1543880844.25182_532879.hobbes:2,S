NAK
This is the wrong way to do it. If you don't support recursive entry then
don't use ->low_latency. If you do then ensure you drop the lock before
you call tty_flip_buffer_push().
The other way this could be tackled which has some merit is to require
that line discipline responses coming from a received frame call a new
tty method so drivers can tell callbacks from arriving data apart from
other events.
