Yes, the process would need to have two ancillary ids then (I actually
mentioned that in the original mail) 
When the tids are chosen out of the same space as pids like you proposed
there would be no conflicts (because kill(-X) can be either a proces group
leader or a tid, but not both)

So put it into the signal_struct in this case. signal_struct would have 
the same signal related fields as the processes, a mask and a pending
flag. when it fires you walk the tid ring again.

I think shared sigprocmask is very useful. How otherwise would you lock
against signals in a multithreaded process ? Locking is really
needed when you're e.g. using queued SIGIO for IO.  Doing the locking
in user space is really nasty in this case
[I just stumbled over a case this week were it would be really useful]

Just how would you protect your queued SIGIO datastructures otherwise ? 
But I agree that it is probably 2.5 material.
