Ok, but why is the message there at all? I think in Windows/XP the offending code 
and the registers are shown in such occasions. I'd say either drop the message, or 
improve it. It's also difficult to find the code after the program is gone due to 
mapping of shared libraries. I managed to get a core dump of the application 
however, and I did modify some code. I'll report once I have results.
Maybe it's "mea culpa" for my program, but powersaved and slapd are still to be 
examined.
Regards,
Ulrich
