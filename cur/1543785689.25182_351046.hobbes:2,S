If the additional ipl information is bound to the ipl device then we'd
have to search for the device if we'd want to get the ipl information.
And if we ever want to make /sys/kernel/ipl_device writable to be able
to change the ipl_device for a reboot then what? Have the ipl related
sysfs files for ALL devices you can ipl from to be able to move to
another device? I think we need a central place for this information.
