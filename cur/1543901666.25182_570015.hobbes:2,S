 > @@ -161,8 +161,11 @@ static inline int ehca2ib_return_code(u64 ehca_rc)
applied, but as a further cleanup it seems that ehca2ib_return_code()
should be moved into a .c file and moved out of line -- I think it

can see it is never used in the data path where the function call
overhead would matter at all.
