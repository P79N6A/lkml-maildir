     This is a new card, a Hauppage WinTV Go. I'm using the patch from 
bttv-0.7.37 for 2.4.0-test4, all modules load OK, bttv (card 10), tuner 
(type=7), videodev, with CONFIG_I2C=y, CONFIG_I2C_ALGOBIT=y.
   With the latest bttv, the previous option "vidmem=0xe50" no longer 
exists. When I tune channels in, I can get the audio, but no video, 
presumably because the video is getting to the video card memory.
   I have tried a Diamond Viper V330 4 Meg card and now a 8Meg i740-AGP 
card both to no avail.
   Help appreciated while I trawl through the sources to see how the 
video card is accessed.
Thanks and Regards
