Hi,
What I would like to know is, if there is a way to see whether a skbuff
in tcp_transmit_skb() comes from a
retransmission or not? I´m using kernel 2.2.5.
If I know the
skb->sk->tp_pinfo.af_tcp.retrans_out
value from the very previous tcp_transmit_skb() invocation and the
current one, is it safe to say that if they differ I have a
retransmission?
Is there any easier way to check for retransmissions?
Any thoughts are appreciated.
Thanks,
    Thorsten
P.S.: I´m doing a project about differentiated services (especially the
premium service) on the host side. Would like to exchange some ideas
with anyone involved in the same.
