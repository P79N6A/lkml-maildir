Yes, I'm currently working on this. Furthermore there was another attempt
(working, as far as I know, though not offering full multikey/multihead 
combination) by Paul Mackerras <paulus@cs.anu.edu.au>. If you like, I can
send you his patches. If you can wait a little (few weeks), my drivers
should be ready by that time.
