Hi Arjan,
 one piece of information that Ganglia collects for a node is the
"number of CPUs", originally meaning "physical CPUs". With the
introduction of HT and multi-core things are a bit more complex now. We
have decided that HT sibblings do not qualify as "real" CPUs, while
multi-cores do.
 Currently we are doing "sysconf(_SC_NPROCESSORS_ONLN)". But this
includes both physical and virtual (HT) cores. We are looking for a
method that only shows "real iron" and works on 2.6 and 2.4 kernels.
Whether this has any practial valus is a completely different question.
Cheers
Martin
