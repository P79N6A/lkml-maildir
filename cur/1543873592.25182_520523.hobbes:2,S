Actually thinking about this a little more I don't think we should put
this in.  Instead this loop should be moved up to fs/read_write.c because
these are checks that we want for all filesystems/drivers that use
vectored I/O.  We'll still need tiny loops to calculate the total
I/O length for now in every method, but that will be gone as soon
as we have our iodesc/uio/whatever structure.
