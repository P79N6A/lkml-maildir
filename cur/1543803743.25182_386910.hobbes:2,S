Right "make all && fakeroot make deb-pkg" was failing, because with
CONFIG_LOCALVERSION_AUTO set, I was both getting a "-dirty" string
appended to the version, as well as something awfully close to a full
rebuild due to the version number changing, and on top of all that, the
dpkg-buildpackage would fail, as "-dirty" doesn't have a number in it
(hence why you see dfsg1 or ubuntu0 in version strings.)
I think I might take your suggestion, and fix up the builddeb script to
do the "run as root" part itself, rather than needing to do it outside. 
It would make it possible to just run "make oldconfig deb-pkg" which
would make things a little bit simpler.
