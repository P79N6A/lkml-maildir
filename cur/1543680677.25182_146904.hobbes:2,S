No ppc, ppc64, s390?
Current bad issues for x86-64: 
- IDE Taskfile IO when enabled corrupts file systems on AMD8111
(on others too?).  This is the worst because there is no fix available.
I would propose to completely disable taskfile in Kconfig 
until the issue is resolved.
- Reiserfs zeroes every second 4K block in any write >4K on 64bit systems
(patch is in -mm*). Hopefully the patch can be merged before 2.6-pre.
and 
- doesn't compile (trivial fixes are already sent)
