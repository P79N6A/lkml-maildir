I'm very reluctant to expose my ignorance by joining this thread;
but what I'd naively expect would, I think, suit swsusp also -
you don't really want tasks to be migrated when resuming?
I'd expect tasks bound to the unplugged cpu simply not to be run
until "that" cpu is plugged back in.
With proviso that it should be possible to "kill -9" such a task
i.e. it be allowed to run in kernel on a wrong cpu just to exit.
Presumably this is difficult, because unplugging a cpu will also
remove infrastructure which would, for example, allow "ps" to show
such tasks.  Perhaps such infrastructure should remain so long as
there are tasks there.
Ignore me if I'm talking nonsense.
