  Interesting, so this tells that:
rank(long long int) >  rank(long int) >  rank(int) >  rank(short int) >  rank(char)
  While following was the previous definition:
rank(long long int) >= rank(long int) >= rank(int) >= rank(short int) >= rank(char)
  Systems do exist where *all* of those have same size, but they are
usually programmed in Fortran-9X, require liquid cooling, and recognize
name "Cray" ...
