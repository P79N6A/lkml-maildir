Steve,
Something isn't quite making sense. If we go over every single instance
of checking ->highmem_io, they all look sane (ie checking on non-highmem
setup must yield 0). So that part looks good.
However, I think a typo snuck in there, in exactly the spot you pasted
above. Could you try 2.4.20-rc2 with this patch applied?
