Clear CONFIG_PARAVIRT from your .config and try "make oldconfig", and find
out for yourself :-)
You'll end up having to answer questions for all other config options
below it, that you never cared about, that you didn't know even existed.
You'd obviously (I would, at least) feel annoyed by it all ... this is
almost a regression :-)
And for those who automate the oldconfig process using "yes", well, this
"default y" *will* end up introducing a kernel text size regression --
all those config options they never had earlier, suddenly got enabled.
Besides, like Andi said, selecting or enabling CONFIG_PARAVIRT is quite
pointless in the first place -- it's just a menuconfig symbol, not a
"real" kconfig symbol that _actually_ controls code in the Makefiles.
