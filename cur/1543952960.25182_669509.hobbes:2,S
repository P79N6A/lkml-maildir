Subject: [PATCH/RFC] introduce ARCH_CAN_UNALIGNED_ACCESS Kconfig symbol
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

In many cases, especially in networking, it can be beneficial to
know at compile time whether the architecture can do unaligned
accesses. This patch introduces a new Kconfig symbol
	ARCH_CAN_UNALIGNED_ACCESS
for that purpose and adds it to the powerpc and x86 architectures.
Also add some documentation about alignment and networking, and
especially one intended use of this symbol.

Users will be added later, especially wireless networking can benefit.

 Due to the byte-wise nature of this operation, unaligned accesses are avoided.

+Alignment vs. Networking
+========================
+
+On architectures that require aligned loads, networking requires that the IP
+header is aligned on a four-byte boundary to optimise the IP stack. For
+regular ethernet hardware, the constant NET_IP_ALIGN is used, on most
+architectures this constant has the value 2 because the normal ethernet
+header is 14 bytes long, so in order to get proper alignment one needs to
+DMA to an address that is can be expressed as 4*n + 2. One notable exception
+here is powerpc which defines NET_IP_ALIGN to 0 because DMA to unaligned
+addresses can be very expensive and dwarf the cost of unaligned loads.
+
+For some ethernet hardware that cannot DMA to unaligned addresses like
+4*n+2 or non-ethernet hardware, this can be a problem, and it is then
+required to copy the incoming frame into an aligned buffer. Because this is
+unnecessary on architectures that can do unaligned accesses, the code can be
+made depend on CONFIG_ARCH_CAN_UNALIGNED_ACCESS like so:
+
+#ifdef CONFIG_ARCH_CAN_UNALIGNED_ACCESS
+	skb = copy skb
+#else
+	skb = original skb
+#endif
