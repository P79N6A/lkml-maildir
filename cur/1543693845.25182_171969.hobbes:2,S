Once upon a time, kernel threads could make use of signals for receiving
control from userspace. Now, the NPTL code looks at the recipient
thread's userspace handlers for signals, even in the case of a kernel
thread, and if there's not a handler installed will either discard the
signal or convert it to SIGKILL.
Could we disable this behaviour in the case where the recipient is a
kernel thread please? Or at least make allow_signal() set sa_handler to
some non-zero dummy value so that the signal is delivered as intended.
