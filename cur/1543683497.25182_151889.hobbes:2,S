   As I already answered privately - I do have them right now.
   And those patches were not mine.
   Most of them was collected right on lkml or from digests on lwn.net.
   [ I was playing only with network code - and I was concerned with 
performance more, than with image size. And had no luck achiving 
something. ]

   Okay. I have found it.
   But I cannot find how it is used.
   I have grepped thru 2.6.0-test0 - but I can find only entries in 
defconfigs - but no mentions in .h/.c files.
   What I'm missing?
   And yes - this option doesn't work in 'make menuconfig'.

   Correct me if I'm wrong.
   I was just poking around 'small is beatiful'.
P.S. To my earlier 'far from vanilla' comment (-x '.*' - to skip 
.depend/.config/etc):
$ diff -urN -x '.*' ./linux-2.4.17 \
/opt/hardhat/devkit/lsp/ibm-walnut-ppc_405/linux-2.4.17_mvl21\
| wc -l
     1128089
$
and more than 500 additional CONFIG_* parameters comparing to vanilla.
