I always do
make clean && make dep && make ......
Notes:
  1) I've always done clean and then dep ever since a problem on Alpha
	where it created a file during dep and deleted it in clean.
	2) I always use && instead of ;  - that way if one of the stages fails
	you don't miss it.
	3) The ..... - some architectures like zImage, some like Image, some
	like boot; hell I can never remember which a particular platform
	needs.  I wish we had some commonality (hmm - an 'itso' target).
	4) Generally make {menu|x}config tells you the story for x86 at the
	end.
