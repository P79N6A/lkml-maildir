I'd say that that request is damn near impossible. First of all, as
Randy has already pointet out kernel.org does not maintain email
archives, secondly, the thread will be archived on a number of
different sites outside kernel.org's control - there are *many* lkml
archives on the 'net. In addition to LKML archives you'd also have to
contact news sites that may have written articles on the thread and
copied the message(s) in part or in full, and then there is any number
of search engines that may have cached the thread and sites like The
Wayback Machine that may have cached the lkml archives or the news
sites etc etc etc... And finally you have a huge number of unknown
people who may have kept personal LKML archives on their private
machines going back several years - there's no way to identify those
people and certainly no way to get them to remove a specific thread
from their personal archives.
Once a message is posted to a public mailing list (especially one as
widely archived & commented on as LKML) it is practically impossible
to get rid of - there's always going to be someone somewhere that has
a copy.
