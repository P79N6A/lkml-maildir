As I understand the current code (ie this may be totally wrong ;-) ) I think 
we already pretty much have what you're suggesting. There's one (or more) 
zone per node chained off the pgdata_t, and during memory allocation we 
try to scan through the zones attatched to the local node first. The problem 
seems to me to be that the way we do current swap-out scanning is virtual, 
not physical, and thus cannot be per zone => per node.
Am I totally missing your point here?
Thanks,
Martin.
