	can be dealt with on ext2, ufs, minix, sysvfs and <hysterical
laughter here> FAT-derived filesystems (ATTR_VOL | <something other than
the mark used by VFAT> in attributes). Can be also done on hpfs and ntfs
(AFAICS - empty file with appropriate EAs).

	ext2, ufs. Probably FAT-derived sh*t too. Not sure whether we can
do it on s5fs and its relatives (including minix).

	... which may be rather different from 4.4BSD ones - you don't
have dcache over there, so the set of problems differs. OTOH we might mark
dentry as whiteout.
