Hi,
Is there any way to tell the kernel that I do not want to make partition 
(/dev/sda1, /dev/sda2, ...) devices (but I still want to have /dev/sda and 
/dev/sdb and /dev/sdb1, /dev/sdb2, ...)?
This can be useful for people that want to use evms/dm for partition 
management instead of kernel directly on selected disks.
Thanks in advance,
Grzegorz Kulewski
