Think of it as an extension of the existing Linux SO_PASSCRED for Unix
sockets, which currently allow you to authenticate the uid/gid/pid of a
local peer process with which you are communicating.  But now extended to
other security information such as an SELinux security context, and for
non-local processes, protected and authenticated via IPsec.
