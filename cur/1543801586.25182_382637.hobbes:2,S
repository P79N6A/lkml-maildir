So far nobody succeeded in 'fixing the routing code', few people can even read 
the code from the first line to the last one...
I think this code is not buggy, it only makes general RCU assumptions about 
delayed freeing of dst entries. In some cases, the general assumptions are 
just wrong. We can fix it at RCU level, and future users of call_rcu_bh() wont 
have to think *hard* about 'general assumptions'.
Of course, we can ignore the RCU problem and mark somewhere on a sticker: 
***DONT USE OR RISK CRASHES***
***USE IT ONLY FOR FUN***

In the case of call_rcu_bh(), you can be sure that the caller cannot afford 
'sleeping memory allocations'. Better drop a frame than block the stack, no ?
