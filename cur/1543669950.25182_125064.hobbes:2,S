True - however I should have included some more info ... Andrew worked
out that some of the hottest ones lead to a null ptr dereference
immediately afterwards anyways, so they're actually pointless.
I wasn't seriously suggesting just removing all of them, was just a point
of interest for some things that would be worth looking at ;-)
I'd agree with you that an unreliable system is 100% slower than a working
one ;-)
