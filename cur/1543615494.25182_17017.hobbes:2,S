    It's not always bandwidth (raw IO) that is the problem. We've got
    a couple clusters where a 3ware 64xx w/4 IBM GXPs in raid0 cannot
    keep up with the "load" of Mysql doing lots of ops on lots of files. 
    Yeah, it's not just how much load, but what kind of load. Streaming
    a 3 gig file into memory, then dumping a 3 gig file to disk is a lot
    different than opening 3000 1 meg files, twitching a bit and then
    closing them. 
    I like our 3ware controllers, they've allowed us to migrate a off a
    whole bunch of Sun Hardware, and saved us a whole bunch of money,
    but on our loaded machines, we've lost a lot of sleep (of course
    some of that seems to be due to memory corruption issues as well.)

    If SCSI had the economy of scale that IDE enjoys, it would be a lot
    cheaper than it is now. Not as cheap as IDE currently is, but still
    a lot cheaper. 
    ATA/IDE is trying pick and choose the best parts of SCSI w/out
    picking up the costs--which is an admirable goal. The question is
    how close can they get w/out incurring the costs?
