the other thing that is pretty ugly is the recursive_enter/clear/exit 
code. I'd suggest the lockdep model here: use a single flag in 
task_struct to detect recursion. Also, never use BUG() when hitting a 
bug in a debugging helper - that will crash the box. Use a flag to turn 
off the whole thing if you encounter an internal bug and print a 
warning. That way bugs can actually be reported, instead of users 
wondering why the box locked up under X.
