1 - I'm not sure all versions of gcc support it, as in "it generates
correct code."
2 - I'm not sure how (if) it works on non-Intel systems.
3 - The performance gain is related to cache size and performance. The
obvious case is unrolling loops, you win if they fit in cache. If you have
a Celeron, P-III with 256k, P-4 with HT on, all have different cache
behaviour. And SMP or memory speed changes the penalty for a cache miss to
main memory.
4 - inertia, minimal gain and experience. Maybe no one sees enough gain to
justify the chance that some version of gcc is really broken.
5 - placebo effect. People just think it's faster because it's different.
6 - quantum effects, like Schroedinger's (sp?) cat it's only faster or
slower if you measure it.
Pick one or more of these as pleases you. My mind say 4, my heart says 
5+6.
