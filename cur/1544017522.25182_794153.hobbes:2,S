Hello,
I read lately about the signals mechanism, and I have a couple of question
that I couldn't find the answer to them. it would be great if someone would
answer.
1. when handling a signal before changing to user Mode, the kernel copies
data to the user stack. what is the data that he saves in setup_frame()?
2. what signals are blocked while in the signal handler? could this mask be
changed?
3. when does a system call could be reentrant and when it cannot, when
disturbed by a signal?
thanks.
