That's already pretty smal, and the single inode (and maybe dentry) will 
make it even smaller. Unless you want to create brazillions of signalfds,
timerfds or asyncfds.

Take a look at what timerfd does and what posix timers has to do to 
implement the interface. You'll prolly stop trolling with things like "a 
lot of overhead" or "too heavy weight".
