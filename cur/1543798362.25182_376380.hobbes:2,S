In theory one could use multiple receive queue on intelligent enough
NIC with the NIC distingushing the sockets.
But that would be still a nasty "you need advanced hardware FOO to avoid
subtle problem Y" case. Also it would require lots of  driver hacking.
And most NICs seem to have limits on the size of the socket tables for this, which
means you would end up in a "only N sockets supported safely" situation,
with N likely being quite small on common hardware.
I think the idea of the original poster was that just freeing non critical packets
after a short time again would be good enough, but I'm a bit sceptical
on that.

Their main problem is that they are used too widely and in a lot
of situations that aren't really critical.
