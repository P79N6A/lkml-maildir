Is this true? I was under the impression that it took a certain number of
cycles to fill up the CPU cache. If a process executes 1 instruction, is the
cache going to be full of its data? How about 10, 20, 300? I was thinking
that there was some number of cycles N, and processes which executed for
less than N wouldn't have a signifigant amount of information in the cache.
I'm reasonably certain that (even if it would work) the patch wouldn't be
worth the extra instructions in schedule(), but that's a different story...
