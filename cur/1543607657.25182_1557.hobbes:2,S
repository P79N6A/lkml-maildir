Can you say where I have wrong?
Code on devfsd_ioctl() [base.c]:
        if (fs_info->devfsd_task == NULL)
        {
            if ( !spin_trylock (&lock) ) return -EBUSY;
            fs_info->devfsd_task = current;
            spin_unlock (&lock);
To me that spinlock looks like it is useless.
Either
	1) If it is mean that lock protects two CPUs settting
            fs_info->devfsd_task when another is set it,
	    then test about fs_info->devfsd_task == NULL
	    should be inside of locked code
or     2) this is protected with some other lock as comment
          perhaps indicates:
        /*  Ensure only one reader has access to the queue. This scheme will
            work even if the global kernel lock were to be removed, because it
            doesn't matter who gets in first, as long as only one gets it
        */
        if (fs_info->devfsd_task == NULL)
        {
            if ( !spin_trylock (&lock) ) return -EBUSY;
Should this be:
