	OK, then. We *have* to keep i_ino unique - icache will get royally
confused otherwise, but we can easily guarantee uniqueness. Not a BFD. But
it will mean that stat() on the same name will give different i_ino each
time it is called. It may screw nfsd.
	Anyway, I'm going to add inode_get_unique() to fs/inode.c,
move the location info for FAT into the msdos_inode_info, exterminate
iget() from msdos/vfat/umsdos (it will break after such change and it
seems to me that it was never intended to be used in ways it's used
there). Stuff around readdir() will have to to use dentry lookups - we'll
be unable to locate struct inode by directory entry anymore. BTW, we'll
have to drop inode from icache as soon as i_count goes to zero (doable).

	Linus, I'm afraid that we'll break nfsd that way. OTOH if somebody
exports FAT filesystem via NFS...
