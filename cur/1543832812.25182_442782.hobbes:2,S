Does any available sound driver interface allow switching output devices
with no help from the app and without having to restart playback?  OSS
does not, and every Windows app I've used has a configuration option to
set the sound device, and you must stop and start playback for it to
take effect.

esd and artsd are no longer needed since ALSA began to enable software
mixing by default in release 1.0.9.  As for jackd and other apps that
provide additional functionality - no one ever claimed ALSA would handle
every audio related function imaginable.  It's just a low level HAL.
