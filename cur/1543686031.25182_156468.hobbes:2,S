This is bandwidth vs. latency. Priority isn't directly correlated to
either. There are patches floating around for more explicit cpu
bandwidth control (which IMHO would be ideal for the xmms problem).
Differentiated service with respect to latency is a bit of a different
story, and appears to have more complex semantics (!= complex code!)
than bandwidth.
