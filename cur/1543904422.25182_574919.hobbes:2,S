linux-arm* mailing lists do not allow cross-posting.

No, noone had that hardware either:-) Those who had preferred to forget 
about it, I guess.

Because I myself was in the situation where my local version of the driver 
was filling with #ifdef's supporting all possible variations of our 
hardware, so, I switched it to platform_driver to clean up that mess. And

hoped they wouldn't.
