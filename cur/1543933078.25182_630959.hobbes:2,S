what's up with this regression? There's been absolutely no activity 
about it in the last 8 days: upstream still regresses, -mm still 
regresses and there are no patches posted for testing.
being able to utilize order-0 pages was supposed to be one of the big 
plusses of SLUB, so booting with _2MB_ sized slabs cannot be seriously 
the "fix", right?
