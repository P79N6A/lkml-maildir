Hi all.
Peter: At this stage, would you mind my becoming "Joint e2compfs
Maintainer" with your good self, at least until such time as I'm much
more au fait with the code and its requirements?
Alan: Presumably, as e2compfs isnae in the raw kernel, it wouldn't be
appropriate to list the maintainer thereof in the MAINTAINERS file
therein, right?

If any more come up that aren't on Linux-Kernel, can you bounce them
to me instead please?

I'm certainly willing to have a go at this, and see what happens.
However, I'm not really sure what would constitute "stress testing" in
this context, so guidance would be appreciated...
Best wishes from Riley.
