Actually, poll(2) seems to have the same behaviour with a simpler
test case (i.e. no epoll, & with just one fd being polled) - if I
read(2) from it every few thousand usec (using the blktrace tool)
it sees new data, but if I poll, it never reports the descriptor
as changed (this is a 2.6.13 kernel with the relayfs patches from
-mm patched into it and Jens' blktrace patch generating the data
that I'm attempting to poll).
cheers.
