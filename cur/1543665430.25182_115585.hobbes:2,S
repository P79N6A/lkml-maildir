Only because the implementations suck.  See etherboot.

But this is all before the kernel is loaded.  Having booted a 1000 node
cluster with TFTP and DHCP.  From a single host with even being in the same
town, I think I have some room to talk.

Right.  But I would suggest fixing your NBP (what PXE load) which must
be < 64K anyway if you have noticeable reliability problems.  Not that
I even suggest using PXE for production use anyway.  But sometimes
you are stuck with what you can do.
