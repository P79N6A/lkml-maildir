No, you don't; that's the estoppel principle.  You only currently need
to scrutinise the pieces of open source your developers actually work
on.

This is the difference in how a lawyer thinks and how we think it might
be practically impossible to sue an open source project for infringement
(any open source project) because of the damage it would do to the
standing of the company, in theory, the option still exists from a legal
perspective.

Right ... it's trying to formulate the words to be the same as the
equitable estoppel principle in US law ... I just don't think it's quite
there yet.

And, in the discussion paper, the patents piece was phrased in terms of
the chilling effects on distributors.  Remove the chilling effect (i.e.
come up with a form of words all our distributors are happy with) and
that particular complaint evaporates.

Please understand ... this discussion document was not made on behalf of
any lawyers or corporations.  It's a distillation of the points made in
the debate we had coming to the vote.  Each author represents themselves
only, not their company.  A lawyer was consulted before it was released,
but only to ensure that the discussion document couldn't damage any
legal actions (real or potential) that might be taken over the current
GPLv2.
