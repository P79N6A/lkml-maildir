Al (or other),
Was there anything that described what these 9 patches are doing,
overall?  They look intriguing, but I'm too lazy to read all the code
in order to get the gist of them.  The per-patch comments at the top
mention something of a "new scheme", but don't, that I noticed, explain
what that means.  Perhaps something on lkml I missed ...?
Thanks.
