</me ignorant of current state of cml2>I sometimes configure and compile
kernels for different computers on my athlon due to the extremely fast
compile time on the athlon. The autoprober would interfere here extremely
badly. Is it disabled by default? I.e. if I do make menuconfig or make
oldconfig will the autoprober temper with my choices?
