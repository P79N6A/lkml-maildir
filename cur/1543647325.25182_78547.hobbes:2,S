That I can't answer,  since I've not had that one specifically thrown at
me as a test failure condition.
However,  in a previous email I did indicate the two different ICMPv6
errors that could be generated.  So I guess it's a case of see if this
was a TAHI failure,  and if so then is it that TAHI want's to get a
'no route to destination' when 'address unreachable' should suffice.
