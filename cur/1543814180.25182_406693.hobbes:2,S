hmm, well, the comment around the check_acpi_pci() call
says: "Checks more than just ACPI actually", so I didn't
want to make it depend on ACPI in the 'first' version,
which now would change semantics, but if it is fine to
make it depend on ACPI, the second version might be the
simpler solution (which should have the same semantic as
your version ... I think
maybe the ACPI folks should clarify if this stuff has to
be run if ACPI is off, in which case renaming the thing
might be a good idea ...
best,
Herbert
