Subject: Buglet in kernel messages in syslog?
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Notice that the dmesg has "not 100% native" and syslog has "not
100ative"
This is an snippet from my demsg:
PIIX4: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev 39
PIIX4: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later
    ide0: BM-DMA at 0xf000-0xf007, BIOS settings: hda:pio, hdb:pio
    ide1: BM-DMA at 0xf008-0xf00f, BIOS settings: hdc:pio, hdd:pio     
This is a snippet from my syslog:
kernel: PIIX4: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev 39
kernel: PIIX4: not 100ative mode: will probe irqs later
kernel:     ide0: BM-DMA at 0xf000-0xf007, BIOS settings: hda:pio, hdb:pio
kernel:     ide1: BM-DMA at 0xf008-0xf00f, BIOS settings:
hdc:pio, hdd:pio                            
I have not clue if the error is in the kernel or in syslog, but
I thought I'd point it out.
