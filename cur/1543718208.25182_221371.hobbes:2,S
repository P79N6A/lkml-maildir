Subject: [PATCH] Sparc doesn't build without input support / can't turn off VTs

Hi.
Tried to build 2.6.6 for my Sparc LX today, which runs headless. Turned
off all the input support and it failed to build - VT support couldn't
be disabled and this needs input support it seems.
Patch below allows disabling VT support for Sparc. I think it might also
want a "select INPUT" in the "config VT" section?
J.
