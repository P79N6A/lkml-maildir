Sounds useful.  Onto my todo list.  And since the list is slowly getting
too long to be memorized, I've added it to my wiki:

It would be relatively easy to add this as well.  The biggest obstacle I

What remains to be decided is whether such a flag is a useful addition.
My gut feeling is yes, but I would like to have more than two votes in
favor.
