Eric, really good job!
Patches: 1-13, 15-24, 26-32, 34-44, 46-49, 52-55, 57 (all except below)
Acked-By: Kirill Korotaev <dev@openvz.org>
14/59 - minor (extra space)
25/59 - minor note	
33/59 - not sorted sysctl IDs
45/59 - typo
50/59 - copyright/file note
51/59 - copyright/file name/kconfig option notes
56,58,59/59 - will review tomorrow
another issue I have to think over is removal of de->owner.
Alexey Dobriyan has sent recently patching fixing /proc <-> modules refcounting.
I guess w/o these patches your changes are not safe if proc_handler or strategy
are functions from the module.
Thanks,
Kirill
