Probably the right approach. slab should use per-cpu for it's internal 
head arrays, but I've never converted the slab code due to 
chicken-and-egg problems and due to the additional pointer dereference.

How slow is slow?
I think the block subsystem uses alloc_percpu for some statistics 
counters, i.e. one alloc during creation of a new disk. The slab 
implementation was really slow and that caused problems with LVM (or 
something like that) stress tests.

That means no large pte entries for the per-cpu allocations, right?
I think that's a bad idea for non-numa systems. What about a fallback to 
simple getfreepages() for non-numa systems?

"Must not" - it contains down() and thus can sleep.
