ah, didnt see that. Could you pick up bits of my patch because it seems 
to do a better job, such as proper c99 initializer:
+static struct notifier_block __cpuinitdata slab_notifier = {
+       .notifier_call = slab_cpuup_callback
+};
instead of your:
+static struct notifier_block __cpuinitdata slab_notifier = {
+       &slab_cpuup_callback, NULL, 0
+};
also, my patch fixes all the warnings as well, not just the errors. So 
please give it a second look ;-)
