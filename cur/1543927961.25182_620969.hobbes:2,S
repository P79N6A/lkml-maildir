Since that's not him, he has no control over its policy and thus no ability
to harm it or help it.

Exactly. But *he* doesn't need to check that checksum, given that he already
got the packet, since he has an upper-level checksum. He is not saying that
his reasoning applies to everyone, just that it applies to him. He is not
talking about disabling the send checksum, but the receive checksum. He
knows that he does not need it.
