No. In the x86 case, it is a question of "do we deliberately restrict this
kernel to running only on a Pentium II in order to make it x% faster". My
suggestion does not duplicate any code, or (with a few exceptions) include any
redundant code for any platform (maths emulation, e.g., would be an exception).
Yours duplicates code, rather than just not optimising it as aggressively.
