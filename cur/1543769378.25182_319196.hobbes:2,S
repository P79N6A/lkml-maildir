The driver(s) don't transmit directly. They put data into a buffer,
usually a ring. The hardware will (depends upon the type) try to
transmit up to 16 times, anything at the current buffer location.
This allows hardware, not software, to try to get a packet on the
wire. The wire can become active or inactive at any time. Usually
the driver correctly assumes that the packet will eventually get
out. If it doesn't, upper levels will send it again. Note that
this is Ethernet, a noisy channel, sh* happens. If the protocol
is connection oriented, the data will be retried forever in an
attempt to get it through. Otherwise, the data is just dropped
on the floor. That's how networking works. You don't waste
valuable CPU resources checking to see if data got onto a wire
when it might get trashed later anyway.
