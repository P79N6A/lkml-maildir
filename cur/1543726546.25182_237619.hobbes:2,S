Another trick laptops can do is that after a resume the card is in
uninitialized state _and_ the video ROM is not there, because the system
BIOS didn't copy it to the right location (when it's stored in a shared
flash). Then you definitely need your own copy from the real boot.

I'm starting to think that using emu86 always (independent on the
architecture) would be best. It's not like the execution speed is the
limit with video init, and it'll allow to find more bugs in emu86 when
it's used on i386 as well. It'll be needed for x86-64 (AMD64 and intel
EM64T) anyway.
