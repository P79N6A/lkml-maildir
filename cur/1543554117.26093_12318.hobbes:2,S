I suppose. Look at what you just stated! This means that a reported
value is now worthless.
To restate, somebody decided that we didn't need this reported value
anymore. Therefore, it is okay to make it worthless.
I don't agree. The De-facto standard has been that the module usage
count is equal to the open count. This became the standard because
of a long established history.
This is one of the tools we use to verify that an entire system
is functioning properly. Now, somebody decided that I didn't need
this tool.
