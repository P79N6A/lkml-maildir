I talked to one vendor about this stuff and fingers crossed we will see
open drivers except for the radio module. In the longer term I suspect
vendors will move to signed register sets, so you can load "US 802.11g"
but you can't load "police frequency, full power"

And non US ones too. The fact people are already abusing the technology
suggests that they will be forced to go the crypted settings route for
next generation hardware anyway.
