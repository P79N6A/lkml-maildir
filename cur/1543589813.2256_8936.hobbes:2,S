There is a school of thought which believes that:
struct xdev_regs {
	u32 reg1;
	u32 reg2;
};
	val = readl(&regs->reg2);
is cleaner than:
#define REG1 0x00
#define REG2 0x04
	val = readl(regs + REG2);
I'm personally ambivalent and believe that both cases should be allowed.
BTW, current {read,write}{b,w,l}() allow both pointer and unsigned
long arguments.  If your implementation isn't casting the port address
arg right now, perhaps you haven't tried to compile very many drivers
which use these interfaces or you're just ignoreing the warnings :-)
