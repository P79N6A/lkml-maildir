Subject: Re: [PATCH] fix PTRACE_ATTACH race with real parent's wait calls

I've thought of one additional race associated with this.  If the real
parent bogusly tried a ptrace (rather than a wait) in that same interval,
it could pass the ptrace_check_attach test and then a moment later not
actually be that task's ->parent any more, which might break all sorts of
stuff and hit BUGs or who knows what.
This further patch should rule out that bogus ptrace call.
Thanks,
Roland
