Subject: [PATCH 1/6] readahead: context based method - slow start
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/6/25/64

The context method will lead to noticable overhead on sparse random reads.
Having the readahead window to start slowly makes it much better.
