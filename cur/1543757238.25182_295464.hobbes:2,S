No, pci_map_rom shouldn't test the signature IMHO. While PCI ROMs should
have the signature to be recognized as containing valid firmware images
on x86 BIOSes an OF, it's just a convention on these platforms, and I
would rather let people put whatever they want in those ROMs and still
let them map it...
