You don't know beforehand where the module itself will end up, so you'll
have to do relocation anyway. If so, you can go the whole way just as
easily.

Read up on initrd / ram disk / ROMfs. Voila, you have a single file but you
still can access the things like they're in a file system.
Anyway, you haven't said why anybody would want to have all the modules in
a single file in the first place.

The current system works, and (for me at least) it works rather well.
So what exactly is your problem?
