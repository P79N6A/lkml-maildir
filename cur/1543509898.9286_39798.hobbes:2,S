There are following codes in inculde/asm/spinlock.h
"lock; btsl $0, %0
 jc 2f
 .section .text.lock, "ax"
 ...
 .previous"
Is the ".text.lock" a subsection of section ".text", the manual
of GAS just told me that a subsection is of format ".text 0", not
.text.lock,
Does ".previous" refer the previous code section, I can't
find such directive in GAS manual.
Can any body help me. ( Please CC to me)
