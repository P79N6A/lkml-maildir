Sorry to darken your door again,
I am trying to compile 2.3.x so I can work w/Mr. Tweedie's kiobuf stuff.
I started w/vanilla RH6.1, did a compile of 2.2.12-20 to make sure I
could do it. (OK)  Then scrounged the software packages listed in
Documentation/Changes - as needed.  When I tried to rpm them in,
there were so many tangled dependencies - and a loop - that I did a
--force --nodeps install.
With both 2.3.43 and 2.3.46, when I get to make dep, I am told that
there is "Nothing to do for dep" and exit w/error 139.  Make bzImage
segfaults.
I haven't found anything in README, or the kernel list FAQ that deals
with anything so primitive.  It is certainly a simple rookie mistake.
Thanks to anyone who can point me in the right direction.
Bill
