Richard Gooch has plotted a good "graphical" picture of what probably
goes on in this case:
           CPU0           CPU1
          crunch          idle
          crunch          xosview
          X               xosview
          X               idle
          X               crunch
          idle            crunch
Now, if the "X" process only requires a few milliseconds it might be
better to keep CPU1 idle for that time.
A quick-and-dirty heuristic would be to leave "CPU1" idle in this case
until the next timer tick. If CPU0 is still busy at that time it
becomes time to give the cruncher a chance on CPU1.
But if Mingo says that the current heuristics already are good enough,
there is no point in trying to do it even better.
