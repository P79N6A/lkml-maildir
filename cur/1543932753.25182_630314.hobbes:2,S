I have noticed this problem:
root@192.168.1.253:~# cat /proc/loadavgrt
1.00 1.00 1.00 0/52 1158
root@192.168.1.253:~# cat /proc/loadavg
0.00 0.00 0.02 1/52 1159
root@192.168.1.253:~#
So I am curious, if possible, user can switch softirq-threads or IRQs
RT tasks to non-RT tasks for slow hardware or least important hardware
for NON-RT tasks. So this will improve RT behaviour.
By default, all softirq-threads or IRQs will be RT task but if there
is some option user can switch it to NON-RT task then it will be good.
Thank you,
Jaswinder Singh.
