How do I get a drive added to the DMA blacklists in ide-dma.c?  I sent
E-mail to Andre Hedrick in August about a drive that claims to support
DMA but flakes out as soon as the kernel tries to use it -- the "WDC
AC31000H".  This is not surprising, since all the other WDC drives of
this vintage have the same problem.  I included a patch to add this
drive to the two blacklists in ide-dma.c.  Andre never responded to my
E-mail, and the drive still hasn't been added to the blacklists.
Am I doing something wrong?  What do I need to do to get this drive
added to the blacklists?
Thanks,
  Jonathan Kamens
