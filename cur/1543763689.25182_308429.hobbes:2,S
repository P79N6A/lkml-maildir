Sorry, I thought you were referring to an RFC that defined IPComp/deflate.
RFC 1950 only defines what a zlib compressed data stream should
look like, it does not define what a deflate compressed data
stream is.
RFC 2394 which defines IPComp/deflate only refers to the deflate
document, and not zlib.
Cheers,
