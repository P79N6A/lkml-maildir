Hi,
      Thanks for asking. I had a critical application that depended on 
them until last week and am now happy to say that even they have moved 
on (I protested the small number of available ptys and explained the 
direction that Unix is going with Unix98 style ptys. Now I depend on 
those. I would be very interested in seeing what you do with your pty 
restructuring as I have a large amount of serial devices.
