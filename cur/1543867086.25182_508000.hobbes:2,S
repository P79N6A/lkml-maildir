mce.c + mcelog do that already for all x86-64 cpus because
that's all reported as standard x86 machine checks.

Well at least the CPU features are redundant.

Possibly, but it's still unclear why you want another interface
if an already existing one is there and works.
Anyways if you feel strongly about having redundant interfaces
you could probably do it.  For the CPU caches etc. it shouldn't
make much difference, although it is unlikely to be very useful
either.
But as I wrote earlier EDAC could be made a consumer of mce.c
events and munge them in whatever format you like there.
Basically it could be an additional presentation layer
for Alan's enterprise users with the hardware schematics
at hand.
My main objection to the K8 northbridge control was though
that it was done in a somewhat non practical way in EDAC (no
useful decoding) and it actually steals the events from the subsystem
that does the useful decoding.

Yes, just mce.c has all that logic already. Not sure what adding
another layer would help there.
[In fact it has too much logic already, more powerful than current x86 CPUs
can support]
Or do you want that to be decided by user space code? That would seem
somewhat risky to me.

No, mce.c handles all the machine checks on Intel CPUs just fine too.
The thing it doesn't do is process chipset events. I can see
the value of external drivers here, although that should be hopefully
a temporary state until Intel finally has integrated memory controllers
too.
Ok PCI error reporting will be likely always separate, but I'm not
sure that it fits very well because it should rather feed directly
into the drivers for them to report IO errors up the normal stacks.

All MCE capable processors generate events,
although how many of them are recoverable greatly varies
(often you just get a unrecoverable exception)

The latest (pre released) mcelog 0.8pre has triggers for excessive
memory errors per DIMM. Is that something you want to do for EDAC too?

Sorry you lost me on that one.
