Hum, yes.

Its too dangerous it seems --- the amount of pages which are
allocated/locked/mapped/submitted together must be based on the number of
free pages otherwise you can run into an oom deadlock when you have a
relatively high number of pages allocated/locked.

Hum, also think about a no-buffer-head deadlock when we're under a
critical number of buffer heads while having quite a few buffer heads
locked which are not going to be queued until all needed buffer heads are 
allocated.
