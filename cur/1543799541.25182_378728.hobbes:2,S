If there is ACPI information for the machine I believe it will put them
in the correct nodes; otherwise it behaves as we did in -mm1, in that
they are not correctly located.  It does however prevent a boot panic
introduced by the pci domain patches.  Something similar needs to be
done here, or those patches dropped?
