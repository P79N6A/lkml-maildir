Thanks for pointing this out! I've been running a selfcompiled vanilla
kernel for the last three days without any of the reported problems
reappearing! :-)
As it looks like, the culprit seemed to be the suspend2 patch. I was not
aware of newer suspend2 patches for 2.6.18.2 and kept using the ones for
2.6.18 instead, which have applied perfectly.
Today i fetched the newest suspend2 patches and rebooted the machine with a
2.6.18.2 kernel containing them. Now let's see if the problem i reported
persists. If yes, i'll report them to Nigel Cunningham instead.
Thanks for the help!
