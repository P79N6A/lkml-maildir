Plus, the PS1 has 2 MB RAM - dunno too much about ultra-small embedded 
systems, but that seems like too little memory even for an 
ultra-stripped kernel and a shell.

PC gaming is one of the driving forces for the development of faster 3D 
graphics systems - should we refuse to make ATI and Nvidia graphics 
cards work since those are primarily used for games?
OTOH, Sony has a very evil reputation for sending lawyers after anyone 
who publishes programming information for their consoles - try to 
reverse-engineer the (proprietary) runtime environment that came with 
their Linux kit, and watch the nastygrams come.  Since Sony didn't do 
any silliness with digitally signed executables ala XBox, the only way 
they can keep unauthorized software from being published is to attack 
anyone who tries to release the hardware information needed to make a 
bootable CD/DVD.
