I agree completely, though my feeling is that if someone plugs a device that broken into a SATA 
controller via a bridge then there "aint nuffin we can do about it" anyway and if it breaks it 
breaks. I guess we could offer the option you suggested before where we load the individual drivers 
as modules and provide a "knobble" module parm that will limit max_sectors to 200 and udma_mask to 
udma/100.
Then we get the hassle if someone wants to use it as the root device, but I guess then you move to 
an initrd and load the module from there.
How far do we want to take it?
Regards,
Brad
