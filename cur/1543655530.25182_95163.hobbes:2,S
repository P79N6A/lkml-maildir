But this doesn't have anything to do with the hidden patch! It can be 
multiple things:
o missing TCP segment offload support
o inefficient zerocopy DMA support
o IRQ routing problems
o wrong QoS settings
Could you please be more specific on what exactly you're trying to 
achieve? Do you want to load balance an application whose average 
package size is 80 bytes? How many sustained connections per seconds do 
you have?
Best regards,
Roberto Nibali, ratz
