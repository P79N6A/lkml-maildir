Hello !
As user "root" I'm trying to load the ath_pci module from madwifi using
the "modprobe" command, which is the recommanded way. But I get the
following diag in the log:
modprobe: WARNING: Could not open '/lib/modules/2.6.23.8-34.fc7/net/ath_hal.ko': Permission denied 
modprobe: WARNING: Could not open '/lib/modules/2.6.23.8-34.fc7/net/wlan.ko': Permission denied 
modprobe: FATAL: Could not open '/lib/modules/2.6.23.8-34.fc7/net/ath_rate_sample.ko': Permission denied 
kernel: Error loading module "ath_rate_sample"
Fedora 7 using kernel 2.6.23.8-34.fc7 as you can see above.
All components in /lib/modules/2.6.23.8-34.fc7/net/ have the permission -rwxr-xr-x 
and the directory itself has drwxr-xr-x 
Which permission is wrong here ?
Thanks a lot !
Claude
