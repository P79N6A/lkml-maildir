What if said daemon keep results on floppy (findfast again) ? Not all
filesystems can safely tolerate removal of floppy with files opened for
writing...

1. Not so large. 2. You can limit this amount (of course slocate should be
suspended till floppy is inserted back).

Thus window should have not only "Ok" button but also "Cancel" button.
Or daemon can be tuned to not even ask user. If the ONLY possible user's
action is to remove floppy and go away, then yes, there are no point in
asking user. Unfortunatelly this is NOT the only case. Not for destop
system, not for server system. It's typical situation only for cybercafe
or services like cybercafe IMHO.

Exactly. We have two concurrent operations: write to floppy and floppy
removal. If we need reliable work we need spinlock (sort of). Since there are
no way to do "spinlock" in hardware we need "spinlock" in software. umount
is way to accuire "spinlock" for removal. Since this operation (removal) can be
reverced if done in wrong time we can do "speculative removal" without
accuiring "spinlock" but then we need to perform reverse operation with help of
daemon if in fact spinlock was held by other operation. That's how it looks
from system viewpoint. This is "spinlock" I talked about above, not drive
lock :-) If you have drive locking you can implement "spinlock" in hardware,
of course.

If floppy was ejected without umount then user violated instruction and no
blames can go on Linux. User can blame ITSELF for forgetfullness but not Linux.
ST> Just prompting for it to be reinserted is inadequate, for the reasons above.
Arrrgggh. Lets see:
 1. RedHat 10.0 includes supermount and it's on by default.
 2. User ejected floppy with corrupted document.
 3. He sues RedHat for 10'000'000$ and claims (rightfully) that there are
    NO violated points in instruction.
Is it Ok for you ? Not for me. At least with umount accurate user can guarantee
that data will not be corrupt. With pop-up windows such gurantee is also exist.
With supermount there are NO such guarantee.
