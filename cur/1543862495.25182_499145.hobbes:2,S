I'm not that keen on this since it wastes 32 bytes per LED when the
platform code does declare the names. If you're happy with that, its up
to you as the platform maintainer I guess but is there no nicer way to
handle this? I'm mainly concerned about people copying this code into
other drivers as then they'll all end up doing it...
