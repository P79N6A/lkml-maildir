Certainly a point -
It's not too unreasonable to bring down a
server for maintenance every 16 months.
However this is good, expensive  hardware...
Consider HP-UX 10.20, a 32-bit, 1996 vintage
commercial unix, in many ways somewhat
primitive compared to Linux:
root@zinc:/root# uname -a
HP-UX zinc B.10.20 U 9000/800 2003576880 unlimited-user license
root@zinc:/root# uptime
  3:24pm  up 681 days,  6:43,  12 users,  load average: 1.17, 1.15, 1.15
So clearly, it's not rocket science....
