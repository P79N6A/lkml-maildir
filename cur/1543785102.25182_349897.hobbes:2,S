C'mon, you and I both know that sg has its place,
and is perfect doing what it is doing now.
But for protocol _interjection_, the mecanism
posted is easiest and sanest.

I cannot call it a "passthrough" since the SMP frame isn't
"passing though" (by passing) anything.  When userspace
does a read(2) to get the data they expect, the SMP
frame they wrote(2) is sent to the SDS immediately.
In effect there is no "passing through".
It is a _protocol_ interjection.
That is an SMP frame (submission) _instantiates_
at that layer/level, not lower, not higher.

Doug, SMP is what it is, and this is where it _instantiates_.
You have to agree that interjecting an SMP frame at any other
level would be _more_ messy.
Plus, I always like presenting things "as is" to userspace
or higher layer, to keep the current layer cleaner and concerned
only with things belonging to it.
