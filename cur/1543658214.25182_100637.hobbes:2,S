Hmmm, I may be ignorant, but I don't see how the below could work.
You're asking for the kernel to map your shared memory in the middle
of an already-mapped area (the bss segment).  I'm actually surprised
it works on any Unix.
If you can point out a clear violation of the POSIX spec, someone may
be willing to change it, but it's not clear to me that you're
guaranteed to be able to map a shared memory area inside your existing
data segment.
