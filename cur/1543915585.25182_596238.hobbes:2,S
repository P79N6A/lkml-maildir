Why do you "have to"?  The vendor has given you explicit rights
to distribute it:
 * Firmware is:
 *	Derived from proprietary unpublished source code,
 *	Copyright (C) 2000-2003 Broadcom Corporation.
 *
 *	Permission is hereby granted for the distribution of this firmware
 *	data in hexadecimal or equivalent format, provided this copyright
 *	notice is accompanying it.
This whole firmware stripping thing in debian is beyond rediculious
and only serves to hurt users.
