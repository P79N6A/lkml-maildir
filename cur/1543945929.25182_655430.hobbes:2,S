Here, it does not.  It seems fine without CONFIG_FAIR_GROUP_SCHED.
Oddity:  mainline git with Srivatsa's test patch improves markedly, and
using sched_latency_ns and sched_wakeup_granularity_ns, I can tweak the
regression into submission.  With sched-devel, I cannot tweak it away
with or without the test patch.  Dunno how useful that info is.
