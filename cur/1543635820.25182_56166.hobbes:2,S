Unix geeks like tradition and they like oddball names that can only be
explained by knowing history; this creates a kind of lore to be passed 
down from senior to junior programmers, a kind of bonding.
This gets increasingly silly as time goes by.  However, it's not yet
gotten so silly that 'bzImage' is likely to be replaced by 'linux' any
time soon.  At least, we don't have to make it any worse and if you
read the whole thread you'll see the consensus is strongly in favor
of pushing the desired image format into the config.
Note that Jeff Dike sensibly called his make target 'linux'.
