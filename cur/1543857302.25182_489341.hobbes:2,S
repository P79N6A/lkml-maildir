Steve,
I'm in the middle of something else and don't have upstream kernel 
source handy at this moment. But I read akpm's comment as 
"write_inode_now" would do writepage and that is *not* what you want (?) 
(since vfs has done that before this call is invoked). I vaguely 
recalled I did try write_inode_now() on GFS1 once but had to replace it 
with "sync_inode" on RHEL4 (for the reason that I can't remember at this 
moment). I suggest you keep "sync_inode" (at least for a while until we 
can prove other call can do better). This "sync_inode" has been well 
tested out (with GFS1's fsync call).
There is another issue. It is a gray area. Note that you don't grab any 
glock here ... so if someone *has* written something in other nodes, 
this sync could miss it (?). This depends on how people expects a 
fsync/fdatasync should behave in a cluster filesystem. GFS1 asks for a 
shared lock here so it will force other node to flush the data (I 
personally think this is a more correct behavior). Your call though.
