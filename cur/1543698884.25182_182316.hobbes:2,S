Well said, which was my response to Linus yesterday
but you said it 100x better. Interfacing linux(which
is what a driver essentially does, may be file system
too) shouldn't be by default considered a derived
work. Using kernel header is a bit more iffy, as that
may accidentally 'copy' some linux code. A driver
writer must be careful in these situations. But the
burden of proof should still be on the linux
community, not the other way round.
