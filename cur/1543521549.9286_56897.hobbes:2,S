Linux 2.3.38 (with initial ramdisk support) crashes upon startup at
the point where it usually announces that it's freeing unused ramdisk
memory.
This is a SMP machine so I get two subsequent watchdog timeouts which
overwrite the screen information so I can't copy down the text from the
original crash. FWIW the original crash is a 'can't handle NULL pointer'
crash.
Cheers,
