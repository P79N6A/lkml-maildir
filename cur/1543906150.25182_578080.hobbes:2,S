Hi All,
I am trying to build netDMA support on linux-2.618.2 for arm-11 box.
  Firstly, is it possible build netDMA on non-intel platforms using
the host dma channels present in the hardware?
  Secondly does this improve network performance on non-intel platforms
without IOAT hardware support?
Thanks
Syed
