It's a bit of a disaster if you happen to msync(MS_ASYNC) the same page at
any sort of frequency - we have to wait for the previous I/O to complete
before new I/O can be started.  That was the main problem which caused this
change to be made.  You can see that it'd make 100x or 1000x speed improvements
with some sane access patterns.

pdflush does, but an msync(MS_ASYNC) which starts I/O puts the IO order
into the application's control.

Well that's always been the case.  MS_ASYNC doesn't write metadata.
