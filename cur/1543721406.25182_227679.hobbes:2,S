Hmmm... What exactly are you wanting to do? Each task theoretically subscribes
to five keyrings (the group one isn't yet there) in this model; three of which
are transferred across a fork, and four across CLONE_THREAD.
The five keyrings are:
	- Group (associated with primary GID)
	- User (associated with UID)
	- Session (voluntarily discarded)
	- Process (shared between threads in a process)
	- Thread (one per thread)

What do you mean by "unreadable"?
Currently, userspace can't see the data attached to a key. It can only see the
description, and only then through /proc/keys.

I can see what you're getting at.
I think I need to create some more operations:
  (*) Retire/Revoke key
  (*) Add key to another keyring
  (*) Remove key from keyring
  (*) List keyring
  (*) Describe key
  (*) Read key (if not protected)
  (*) Create keyring
I have pondered representing keyspace with some sort of filesystem interface
(using vfs ops to represent the operations), but that could require hardlinked
directories (keyrings) to pull off - either that or symlinks.
Also, there's the problem of security on the operations themselves. How do you
determine what a process is allowed to do?
Either I should only allow access to keys and keyrings to which a process is
subscribed, or I should attach UID/GID/MASK values to every key and keyring.
