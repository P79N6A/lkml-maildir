I think you're missing the point. The tar archive can have whatever the hell 
permissions it likes; you as the user of tar and risking extraction as root 
should know what tar does and (if you care) take action to negate it.
Even back before the kernel tar files made every file writable by all, there 
were always a few files that were marked executable (!!) by all. Bottom line: 
you can't rely on the permissions in the tar files.
Even if the world writable thing is fixed (obviously I would not be opposed to 
this), I _strongly_ recommend that you add the two flags to tar as a root 
user so that ANY tar you extract will be extracted with 100% guaranteed safe 
permissions..
(You probably aren't aware of the recent bug found in the kernel build system 
where, if compilation was executed as root, it would overwrite the /dev/null 
node with a regular file -- now THAT'S a security problem!)
