Hi.
You dream of things that never were and you start asking yourself 
'WHY?'
You've got the looks, the brain, the body but how come Mr. Right has 
not come into your life?  Is there such thing as Mr. Right or only 
Mr. Good Enough?
Then, you will start comparing yourself with someone who has nothing
that you have but has got Mr. Right.  What is even more envious is that 
she did not go out of her way to look for the man of her dreams.  
Impossible??
