Hello,
The latest (12 Oct 2004) microcode update data file for Intel processors 
(x86 and x86_64) is now available from the usual place:
http://urbanmyth.org/microcode/
Also note that the microcode_ctl utility has been changed in the latest
tar.gz file to NOT do the ioctl ("-i" option) which is no longer supported 
by the driver. So, if your startup scripts still invoke it with "-i" 
please update them accordingly.
Kind regards
Tigran
