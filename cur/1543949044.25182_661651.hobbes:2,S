	I haven't investigated in any detail, but with 2.6.25-rc3 and your
patch I'm seeing a Xen guest hit this BUG:
void __init smp_alloc_memory(void)
{
        trampoline_base = alloc_bootmem_low_pages(PAGE_SIZE);
        /*                                                                      
         * Has to be in very low memory so we can execute                       
         * real-mode AP code.                                                   
         */
        if (__pa(trampoline_base) >= 0x9F000)
                BUG();
}
	Stack looks like:
  [<c137ef97>] smp_alloc_memory+0x25  <--
  [<c137ef97>] smp_alloc_memory+0x25 
  [<c137a500>] setup_arch+0x28e 
  [<c13735f7>] start_kernel+0x7a

Cheers,
