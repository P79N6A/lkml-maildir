Subject: Re: [PATCH 1/1] x86: Make _syscallX() macros compile in PIC mode on i386 (updated patch)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

From: Markus Gutschke <markus@google.com>
Gcc reserves %ebx when compiling position-independent-code on i386. This 
means, the _syscallX() macros in include/asm-i386/unistd.h will not 
compile. This patch is against 2.6.15.6 and changes the existing macros 
to take special care to preserve %ebx.
The bug can be tracked at 
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=6204

Would you like this patch better? It now unconditionally replaces the 
old macros with a fixed version. This will entail a minor performance 
penalty in non-PIC mode. But for the vast majority of applications the 
difference should be entire negligible.
Once this change has made it into the kernel, I will try to get it 
propagated into libc.
