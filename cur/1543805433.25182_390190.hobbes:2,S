Subject: [ 15/23] [Suspend2] Helper for counting uninterruptible threads of a type.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/1/25/385

Add a helper which counts the number of patches of a type (all
or userspace only) which are in TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE state.
These tasks are signalled (just in case they leave that state at
a later point), but we do not consider freezing to have failed
if and when they do not enter the freezer.
Note that when they eventually leave TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE state,
they will enter the refrigerator, but will immediately exit if
we no longer want to freeze at that point.
