The natsemi docs here say otherwise. I trust them not you.

3C503 needs delays for some setups according to the docs. I can't tell
you how the 3COM drivers did it as that was a different bit of 3com to
the bit I worked for. From the rest of 3Com I saw probably utterly
vilely ;)
Later 3Com stuff was either sane (3c509 etc) or used whacko intel chips
(3c507/27) which had their own special breed of insanity to replace
address setup delay bugs.

No. The problem is that certain people, unfortunately those who know
nothing about ISA related bus systems, keep trying to confuse ISA delay
logic with core chip logic and end up trying to solve both a problem and a
non-problem in one, creating a nasty mess in the process.
