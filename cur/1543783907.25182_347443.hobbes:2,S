Correct, although some administrators find it useful too

Non GPL modules are required not to be derivative works (a term of law).
The EXPORT_SYMBOL information is merely advisory to help seperate
symbols. In many cases its purely historical as to whether a symbol is
marked _GPL or not.
If a work is derivative of another GPL work by any means then the GPL
applies to it. If it is not then the GPL has no power over it because
the GPL is a copyright based license. The law itself circumscribes the
power of such licenses and their reach.
And no doubt German law could be totally different.
