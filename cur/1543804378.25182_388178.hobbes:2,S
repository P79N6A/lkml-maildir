It has typical features of a standard network card, while also
supporting direct user access to the hardware.  We eschew the
offload-as-much-as-possible approach that other vendors take.

We certainly can do that.  The hardware doesn't need to do much more, in
fact.

This is all done in software.  The low-level driver and hardware fill
out enough of the IB UD protocol headers to put packets on the wire that
an IB switch will route.  The higher-level layer is responsible for the
full IB protocol suite and the driver-side interfaces to the various
OpenIB userspace APIs.

Yes.  It can do both the low-level wonkery and regular IB at the same
time.
