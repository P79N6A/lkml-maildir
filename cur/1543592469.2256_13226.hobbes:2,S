Shouldn't it be doing the mount 'silently' when mount(8) is guessing the
filesystem type? I'm seeing this too (2.2.19 + ext3 0.0.6b):
lilith:tmp$ cat /etc/filesystems
ext3
vfat
lilith:tmp$ grep floppy /etc/fstab
/dev/fd0 /floppy auto noauto,nodev,nosuid,user 0 0
lilith:tmp$ # with a VFAT filesystem on /dev/fd0:
lilith:tmp$ mount /floppy
VFS: Can't find an ext3 filesystem on dev fd(2,0).
Looking at the kernel source, read_super (and hence ext3_read_super) are only
called with silent=1 when mounting the root filesystem. I believe mount(8)
checks for magic numbers at the start of the filesystem, and so avoids
attempting a mount for ext2 or various others.
As the kernel (2.2 or 2.4) doesn't seem to provide a way for userspace to
request a silent mount, I don't know whose (if anyone's) bug this is.
