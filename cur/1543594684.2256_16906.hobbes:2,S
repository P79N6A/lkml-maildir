I did an 'insmod uhci.o debug=1' but the dmesg output did not alter.
My easy steps to reproduce it is to 'delete selected images' in gphoto such
that there will be no images in the camera left when the operation is done. 
At loast it doesn't lock up the camera like it used to :-/
I think this may be a problem in the dc2xx.o then, since uhci didn't reveal
any new messages.
