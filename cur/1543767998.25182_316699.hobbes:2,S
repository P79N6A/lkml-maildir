Joe's symptoms are not consistent with ub. I use ub with my iPod, it works
just fine, only somewhat slow (my partition size on iPod is a multiply
of 4KB, so it only loses speed because of external fragmentation).
I suspect Jor has cabling problems or something like that.
If anyone observes data integrity issues with ub, I need to know
right away.
