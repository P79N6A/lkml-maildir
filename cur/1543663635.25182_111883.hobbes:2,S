Exactly. Which means that UKVA has all the same problems as the current 
global map.
There are _NO_ differences. Any problems you have with the current global 
map you would have with UKVA in threads. So I don't see what you expect to 
win from UKVA.

Exactly what _is_ "per-process"? The only thing that is per-process is 
stuff that is totally local to the VM, by the linux definition.
And the rmap stuff certainly isn't "local to the VM". Yes, it is torn down 
and built up by the VM, but it needs to be traversed by global code.
