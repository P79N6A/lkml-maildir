If you wait a few seconds before verifying that the checksum of the
rescue kernel is still correct, then you should be able to be reasonably
sure that there won't be any corruption.
Nothing's 100% here, of course. But the chances that a delayed network DMA
causes the rescue kernel to write its dump data to an area it shouldn't
write to are small enough not to matter. IMHO.
