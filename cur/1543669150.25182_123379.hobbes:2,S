Am I right if I guess that this is the execve("/proc/self/fd/?") solution? I'm 
asking since I'm running 2.4.20 right now and I do not have such a syscall.
I'm not sure if I truly like the idea of having to rely on the existence of 
the proc fs, especially not since there is the chroot call. fexecve would 
also be a nice thing just because of that, since it allows you to keep a file 
descriptor over a chroot away from any /proc accessibility and then exec it.
For that reason, a fexec call could increase security in certain areas.
If I've missed the introduction of a fexecve syscall, I'm sorry for wasting 
your time.
