A few comments. I think making swappiness depend on the amount of
swap you have used is not a good idea. I might be wrong though, but
generally you should only make something *more* complex if you have
a good rationale and good numbers (you have the later, Andrew might
consider this enough). I especially don't like this sort of temporal
dependancy either, because it makes things much harder to reproduce
and think through.
Secondly, can you please not mess with the exported sysctl. If you
think your "autoswappiness" calculation is better than the current
swappiness one, just completely replace it. Bonus points if you can
retain the swappiness knob in some capacity.
Numbers look good though. I'll get around to doing some tests soon.
