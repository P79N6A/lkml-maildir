I realize you guys are probably far down this road in the design
process, but FWIW: This is a major motivation for the reason that the
IOQ stuff I posted a while back used strings for device identification
instead of a fixed length, centrally managed namespace like PCI
vendor/dev-id.  Then you can just name your device something reasonably
unique (e.g. "qumranet::veth", or "ibm-pvirt-clock").
(I realize that if you are going to do PCI, you need to make it
PCI-like.  But I think using PCI in the first place is probably the
wrong direction.  IMHO, there's really not a lot of reason to be
constrained by a hardware specification once you decide to go PV.  This
is even more true if you want to support as many platforms as possible
(i.e. platforms that don't have PCI natively).
