yes, agreed, this is a valid special case of simple counter readout - 
we'll add support to couple counters like that.
Note that this issue does not impact use of multiple counters in 
profilers. (i.e. anything that is not a pure readout of the counter, 
along linear time, as your example above suggests).
Once we start sampling the context, grouping of counters becomes 
irrelevant (and a hindrance) and static frequency sampling becomes an 
inferior method of sampling.
( The highest quality statistical approach is the kind of multi-counter
  sampling model you can see implemented in KernelTop for example, where
  the counters are independently sampled. Can go on in great detail about
  this if you are interested - this is the far more interesting usecase
  in practice. )
