	I saw many patches implementing different process schedulers in the
kernel. Wich one you will reccomend for use on a machine with lots of RAM
and CPU power (SMP, of course), running lots of VMWare instances? (over 10
virtual machines simult.)
	The virtual machines are used mainly for compilation - they run WinNT,
Win2000 and different Linux distros, and have access to a lot of free (or
not-so-free) compilers. I'm trying to give those virtual machines as much
performance as possible. However, i don't know wich scheduler would be the
best fit for this environment.
