A few weeks ago, I wrote a message here about my system
(dual P-II 300, asus p2l97ds mobo, scsi only (ide-disabled),
kernel v2.2.13) crashing all the time when scrolling under X.
It would lock-up solid. The serialterminal was also dead, then.
The graphicscard was a Diamond S220 (4MB). What I did was;
upgrade the bios from 1.005 to 1.008 (which also updates the
adaptec scsi bios to 2.x) and upgrade the bios of the diamond-
card. It seemed to solve the problem! This really puzzles me
since, as far as I know, Linux does not use the bios of a
system to /do/ things. Am I right?
Then, another good thing happened yesterday; I used that diamond
card since one day my matrox millenium g200 went blank; no sync
signals(!) on the monitor anymore. I sent Matrox a message, got
back some dos-util which resets some on-prom-settings or whatso-
ever and it works again! Really hilarious.
So; 2.2.13 works fine on the system mentioned above. Even no fs-
corruption! :-)
