RedHat's kernel is, I'm sorry, a car wreck of too many patches.  We tried 
that in the hosting environment, had many many gremlins as a result.  Most 
of which are still unresolved.  I've got httpd's and mysqld's that the 
root/listener process uses up almost all of the CPU.  And they're not doing 
anything.
Even without that I'm all for cleaner kernels, hopefully with pretty well 
documented reasons behind changes or clear reasons.  RH is trying to be 
everything, which is fine for them and their intended audience.  I've never 
really been happy with their kernels, nor with their base os.  Many are 
though.
Why can't a community do this though?  I guess the answer is there's no 
reason a community cant, jsut the mainline developers are not going to, 
because it's too much work.

I think stable should also include bugfixes and updates without having to 
take (potentially, if not certainly) incompatible changes along with that. 
Which yes, is closer to many distro's models.

The only argument I have is one that won't fly at all here on LKML and 
that's about all the corporate sponsors the LK has that are also doing 
custom closed source modules that are only useful for their particular 
hardware.  I'm working with more than one such company now, if they want to 
step forward and name themselves they can, but I can't name them.  Without 
these companies paying various salaries and developing using Linux and 
pushing bugfixes back/etc on the open source portions of their products it 
would be a different landscape.

Most of it can't.  Or simply won't be accepted.  Noone else has use for a 
PPC where the GPIO is driving a custom data acquisition FPGA, or things of 
that nature.  Some of it is the same old problem of proprietary firmware 
and IP.  Some of it isn't.  Most of it is just simply useless to everyone 
but the device's manufacturer, and thus wouldn't be maintained anyway, much 
less accepted.  I guess for those cases that it *might* be accepted and can 
be exported I'll have to decide where the tradeoff occurs between answering 
external questions about hardware that doesn't exist outside of these 
devices and apps.
There again, this is still just one part of the problem as a whole 
discussed in this thread.
