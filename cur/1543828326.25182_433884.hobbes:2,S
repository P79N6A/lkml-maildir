I realized that before I sent the email.  /bin/sh is guaranteed (usually) to
be there.  I myself prefer zsh, but when I'm booting with init=, it's always
/bin/sh (unless I'm testing something else).  Of course, that's just me. 
The one time I did use init=/bin/zsh, it failed to function properly (forgot
the details), but booting with /bin/sh and exec zsh worked fine.
Is there any (non-embedded) linux systems out there that do not have
/bin/sh ?  On the boot cd I built, there is no /bin/sh but there is a
/bin/init (shell script with #! busybox ash  at the top)
Anyway, it's a thought.  Or you could only enable it if the init= is not
init (Any other inits?)
