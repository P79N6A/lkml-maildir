No, upon module load the device tree could be locked and the module
insertion could wait for all matching devices in the tree to be probed.
It definitely can be done and that solution cannot be achieved from
userspace because exporting such locks would be a disaster.
However, it is probably not wise to provide for this special case.
It would probably be best to provide a generic probe method for
devices, which could run synchronously.
