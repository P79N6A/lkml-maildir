  Do I get it right that you just have in each cnode a pointer to the
previous & next cnode? But then if two consecutive cnodes get corrupted,
you have no way to connect the chain, do you? If each cnode contained
some unique identifier of the file and a number identifying position of
cnode,  then there would be at least some way (through expensive) to
link them together correctly...
