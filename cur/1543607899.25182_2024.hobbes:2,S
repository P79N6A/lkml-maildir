Hi david.heremans!
I browsed through linux/drivers/char/pc_keyb.c and linux/drivers/keyboard.c
and it doesn't seem like it's caching sets/gets. I quickly browsed through
your code, but I didn't really look for errors. Instead, I hacked a quick
program for you which does exactly what you want. I don't have an ipac, but
I tested it on my PC (just pressed the keys, etc.) and it should work. If it
doesn't you should check the datasheet and see whether there shouldn't be
any delays between settings the leds.
PS: The program is attached
