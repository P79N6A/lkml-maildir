If you check out the code again, you can see that I _don't_ have signal code
for SIGPIPE, it's SIG_IGN-ed. I only have signal handler for SIGSEGV, which
is executed when the bogus jump occurrs to 0x1.
I agree that this can be either a kernel, pthread or libc problem.
BTW: the SIGSEGV occurs on UP machine with SMP kernel as well.
