I was afraid of that.

Well, this comes up in the case of having kexec take over from a crashed 
kernel; the state of any given PCI card is unclear, and its conceptually
easiest to hit them with a hammer to put them back into a known state.
For hotplug slots, this can be accomplished by toggling power to a slot,
but not all slots out there are hot-pluggable. 
The other situation where this is useful is in recovering from a PCI bus
error (e.g. parity error); but his has additional complications.
I've got someone here  asking about the LSI megaraid controller; 
appearently its under-documented, and it can hang hard on kexec. 
Hitting it with a reset would make life simpler.
