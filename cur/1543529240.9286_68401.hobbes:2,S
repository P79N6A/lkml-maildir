Cc: trimmed to linux-kernel only, this looks like a kernel and/or
modules problem.

You have kernel module loader support compiled in.  This automatically
loads modules as required.  The cron job automatically unloads those
modules that are not in use.

scsi_io_completion is in scsi_lib, part of scsi_mod.  Either scsi_mod
is not being reloaded when required or, more likely, it is still
present but is marked as deleted.  Please reproduce and do "cat
/proc/modules".  If scsi_mod is marked "(deleted)" then the problem is
that scsi_mod cleanup is not working.  There are known bugs in scsi
clean up on 2.3.49, try 2.3.50.
