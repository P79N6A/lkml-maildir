Patch seems to do its job :
$ dmesg | grep -i mouse
[   24.039229] mice: PS/2 mouse device common for all mice
[   24.790995] input: ImExPS/2 Generic Explorer Mouse as /class/input/input1
[  192.060997] psmouse.c: Explorer Mouse at isa0060/serio1/input0 lost
synchronization, throwing 1 bytes away.
[  192.569915] psmouse.c: resync failed, issuing reconnect request
