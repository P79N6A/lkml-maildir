No, the ftp program only needs to transfer the HTML part.

Ok, does this mean that every directory in the filesystem (or in
some part of it) will automatically have a node ..archive?
Presumably, it will not appear in directory listings, but can be
read but not written to?  Does this mean that a legacy application
(pathological as it may be) that expects to be able to create a file
called ..archive will fail?
Or do you mean that the application would explicitly create the node
associated with this plugin?

Anyway, you didn't answer the part I really care about.  What calls
does the application make to store the HTML and the "extended
attribute"?  You can pick whatever conventions you want, just give
me an example.

How do I access the file called ..bar (created in NT) in the
directory /foo?
(Anton, does NTFS define any reserved filename characters, or only
win32?)
