On the contrary, I think it has divided the kernel developers firmly into
two classes: the "ins" and the "outs".

Oh I don't disagree at all.  Bitkeeper is a big improvement over what
existed before.  But it is proprietary.  Which other tool in the tool chain
is proprietary?
Heck, it's not even that proprietary.  As far as I know I can still download
the source.  But... looking at those files sitting in the Documentation
directory, it looks to me like a big old Marlbourough[TM] ad.
