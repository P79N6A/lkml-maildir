Why fork from David's work?  Does he not like these changes for some
reason?

Use an attribute group please.  It's much simpler and will be created at
the proper time so your userspace tools don't have to sit and spin in
order to properly wait for them to show up.
Ok, yes, you want a conditional type of attribute group, like the
new firewire code does.  I have no problem adding that if you like.
thanks,
