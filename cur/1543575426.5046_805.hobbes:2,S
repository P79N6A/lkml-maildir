Hello,
   I sent Linus a patch a few minutes ago regarding a tq_struct issue within drivers/i2o/i2o_lan.c . Alan just sent out a MD5sum for test12-pre8 , so I would double check the MD5sum against your version of test12-pre8 to see if your errors are from 'old' test12-pre8 or 'new' test12-pre8 . Who knows, maybe will release a test12-pre9 soon. :-)
Regards,
-Frank
