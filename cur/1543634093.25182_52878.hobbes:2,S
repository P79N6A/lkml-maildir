For me the advantage of doing this in user space is that we can use simple 
scripting to handle all the exceptions (and actually, allowing easy 
reconfiguration of the exceptions), but I agree, a reference implementation 
would be a useful demonstration.

That depends on whether you really need the unique id at boot or not.  The 
boot code is really only looking for the root filesystem, which can be found 
by fs label, so there may not be a need to put all this in initrd.  However, 
if we have to it would go in as part of the diet{libc, hotplug} stuff.
If you don't put it in initrd, then you have an init script that runs to scan 
all the existing devices and configure them accordingly.

Without /proc, depending on how you do the sg<->sd mapping, possibly.  Without 
sg, no since I'd use that to formulate the SCSI cdb to get the ID.

Since this is a one time configuration, is overallocation such a bad thing 
(particularly as the allocator is moving towards a much more dynamic model in 
2.5)?  You can allow the normal stuff to run and then trigger multi-path 
configuration adds as you see the same unique ID come in for different devices.

device_list is what first got me thinking down this path:  I keep running into 
customer problems that boil down to XXX linux distribution doesn't find all 
the LUNS on my array.  The obvious answer is "that's because it isn't in 
device_list".  Now, I could solve the problem by giving the customer a kernel 
patch adding the device, but this runs into problems with inexpert users, or 
enterprise customers who won't deviate from the "standard" kernel.  Being 
lazy, the solution I ultimately adopted was to send them an init script that 
recognised the array from it's inquiry strings and used scsi-add-single-device 
to probe its LUNs.
