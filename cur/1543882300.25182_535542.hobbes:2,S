I recompiled 2.6.21-rc6-mm1 from fresh sources.
It still hangs initializing USBm but this time your
patch applied.
I rebooted with your patch, and got:
Detailed lists of all the USB devices found
(printer,mouse,...)
Then usbcore registered various drivers, such as
usblp, usb-storage, libusual, usbserial, ipaq
These messages were intermixed with messages from
the md raid system initializing
The three last lines were:
sdhci: Secure digital host controller interface driver
sdhci: copyright Pierre Ossman
usbcore: registered new interface driver hiddev
And then the machine hung completely.  I'll have
a look at bisecting. :-(
