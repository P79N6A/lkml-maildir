The new syscall what certainly be used like this.  In fact, the two
syscalls happen exactly one after the other in my sources.  So I would
be in favor of making a change along these lines.  But instead of
fixing the interface in this way it should be extendable.  Pass a
structure and a flag value.  The latter specifies which elements of
the structure are used.  The structure could even grow over time.

This is not necessary.  Especially because we already reached the
limit of parameters to clone.  A dedicated syscall to set up various
things like the TID pointer and the robust list is fine.

I know you want to save SPARC but this kind of overloading I don't
really like.  If you need special treatment of the futex value make
this explicit and arch-dependent.
