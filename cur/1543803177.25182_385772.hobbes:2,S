You'd have to quantify that somehow, in terms of the max drift rate
(ppm), and the max resolution available (< tsc frequency).  
Either that, or track an offset, and use one TSC as truth, and update
the correction factor for the other TSCs as often as needed, maybe?
This is kind of analogous to the "drift" NTP calculates against a
free-running oscillator. 
So you'd be pushing that functionality deeper into the OS-core.
Dave Mills had that "hardpps" stuff in there for a while, it might be a
starting point.
Just some thoughts for now...
