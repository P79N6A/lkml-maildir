I have been looking into "slub" recently to avoid some of the NUMA alien
cache issues that we were encountering on the regular slab.
I am having some stability issues with slub on an ia64 NUMA platform and
didn't have time to dig further. I am hoping to look into it soon
and share the data/findings with  Christoph.
We also did a quick perf collection on x86_64(atleast didn't hear
any stability issues from our team on regular x86_64 SMP), that we will be
sharing shortly.

I will not suggest for default on at this point.
