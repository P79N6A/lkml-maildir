Hi Andreas, Stephen, 
We have a lot working now: 
1. journal recovery and initialization stuff is working
2. transactions go to the disk
3. infrastructure is there to do transcactions
4. ext3_create is fully operational. 
The problems we have seen mostly have to do with differences in which
buffer heads are being initialized.  Things like b_transaction etc. were
not cleaned up.
There are more buffer head problems around, but we are debugging them
quickly now.
You can play with this, make a loop device, mount it and to things like
touch (NOTE: only file creations have been handled so far).  If you
re-mount a dirty ext3 image, it will recovery.  The first few always
work, but at present things go wrong when bdflush kicks in.
We left a patch at: 
ftp.inter-mezzo.org:/pub/ext3/242-ac26-1um.ext3-ph5_4.patch.gz
In the patch there are markers of the form @@@ with your names, asking for
help!
