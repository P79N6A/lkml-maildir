Right.

Hmmmm.. Okay. But that is mainly a device driver maintenance issue.

That is addressed on the VM level by the mmu_notifier which started this 
whole thread. The RDMA layers need to subscribe to this notifier and then 
do whatever the hardware requires to unpin and pin memory. I can only go 
as far as dealing with the VM layer. If you have any issues there I'd be 
glad to help.
