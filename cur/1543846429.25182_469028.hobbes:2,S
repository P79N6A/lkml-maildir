A while ago I did a SystemTap script to solve a problem similar to 
this.  It's been siting in my system for a while collecting dust and you 
currently don't need the embedded C code since the networking.stp tapset 
has all this script needs(and more), but I should point you in the right 
direction.
This worked a couple of months ago but it is currently untested.  Hope 
it helps.

global ifstats, ifdevs, execname
%{
#include<linux/skbuff.h>
#include<linux/netdevice.h>
%}
probe kernel.function("dev_queue_xmit")
{
        execname[pid()] = execname()
        name=skb_to_name($skb)
        ifdevs[name] = name
        ifstats[pid(),name] <<< 1
}
function skb_to_name:string (skbuff:long)
%{
        struct sk_buff *skbuff = (struct sk_buff *)((long)THIS->skbuff);
        struct net_device *netdev = skbuff->dev;
        sprintf (THIS->__retvalue, "%s" , netdev->name);
%}
probe timer.ms(5000)
{
        exit()
}
probe end {
        foreach( pid in execname) {
                if (pid == 0) continue
                printf("%15s[%5d] ->\t", execname[pid],pid)
                foreach( ifname in ifdevs) {
                        printf("[%s:%7d] \t", ifname, 
@count(ifstats[pid, ifname]))
                }
                print("\n")
        }
        print("\n")
}
