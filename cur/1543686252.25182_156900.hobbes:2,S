My personal goal is to have it configured in time to catch stuff in
the boot process so I can avoid plugging into the serial console,
which means everything on the command line. So I've got code to parse
the following:
netconsole=[src-port]@[src-ip]/[<dev>],[tgt-port]@<tgt-ip>/[tgt-macaddr]

..and are stripped by printk before the console code is called. The
netdump patch logs everything at level 5:
+               send_syslog_skb(dev, syslog_line, syslog_chars, 5);
My patch adds another entry to console struct for writing with levels.
And adds hostname to messages. Still needs timestamp.

Not sure that's the right place for it, simply because that's the one
group of people it's not terribly useful for. Especially when I start
talking about hooking it up to kgdb. And the network bits are pretty
much there already.
