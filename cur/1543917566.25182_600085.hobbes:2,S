Subject: [2.6.23-rc8-mm2] System hangs (loops?) during boot

My Toshiba Satellite A40 (i386, P4 ) hangs during boot after:
Marking TSC unstable due to: possible TSC halt in C2.
Time: acpi_pm clocksource has been installed.
It may not actually hang, but rather end up in a loop as after some time the 
fan goes wild.
System boots fine with 2.6.23-rc8. Have not tried earlier mm releases.
Any suggestions where to look before I do a bisect?
Cheers,
FJP
