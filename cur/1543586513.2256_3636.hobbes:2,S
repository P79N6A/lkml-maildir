I'm working on this. In theory it should be possible with SAK. Alt-SysRq-k
resets the console. Here it set the vc_mode back to KD_TEXT and the
keyboard back to VC_XLATE. It even reset ths palette. What it doesn't do
is reset the hardware state. I hope to change this for 2.5.X. It is
possible using fbdev to do this very easily. I'm working on it so you can
go back and forth between fbdev and vgacon for those who want to if their
hardware supports it use vgacon. This can be applied to this problem very
easily.
