           Summary: wheel doesn't works on a usb mouse
    Kernel Version: 2.5.59-bk2
            Status: NEW
          Severity: low
             Owner: vojtech@suse.cz
         Submitter: tamaguci@katamail.com
Distribution: debian sid  
Hardware Environment: via kt-400, athlon xp 2000 
Problem Description: 
I have a logitech optical usb mouse, 
the problem is that the 2.5.59-bk2 kernel doesn't see the wheel 
(on the same system, the wheel works perfectly under 2.4.21-pre4). 
I noticed that trying to "cat /proc/input/mice" while moving the 
mouse return some strange symbol unless i try to move the wheel. 
Steps to reproduce: 
plug in the mouse :-) 
ps I use devfs support.
