Thanks for your suggestion, it has fixed the inotify problem. But where
to put the fix is turning into a bit of a mess. Some callers like
drivers/md/dm.c:682 call idr_get_new_above as if it will return >=
starting_id. The comment says that it will return > starting_id, and the
function name leads people to believe the same thing. In the patch below
I change inotify do add one to the value was pass into idr. I also
change the comment to more accurately reflect what the function does.
The function name doesn't fit, but it never did.
