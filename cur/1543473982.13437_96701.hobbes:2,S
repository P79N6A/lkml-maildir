Hmm, the only thing I touched in svc.c is a jiffy wrap issue. I don't
think it can help you. But there are some knfs patches that gone in
Linus's 2.2-pre3 tree in the last days. Maybe it will help you (really I
also read an Oops report in this list that is been reported after the
patch gone in though ;).
If the bug is easy to reproduce I can also try to understand what's
going wrong myself...
