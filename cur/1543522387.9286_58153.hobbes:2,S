I was just thinking about that.  Might it be possible to do the check in
the background, after mounting the disk?  Done sequentially for
partitions on the same disk of course.  And perhaps with a bandwidth
throttle.  If the background check finds a problem, it does the same
thing as any other time ext2 detects an error.
Meanwhile the boot process can go on.
