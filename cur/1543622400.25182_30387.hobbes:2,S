Ok, but I think that may be a little bit out of my league. I mean, I'd
like to help, but where am I supposed to find all the individual patches?
Is is possible to break the pre1-pre2 patch file into individual files?
Or, is there a repository for that sort of thing? Or if someone emailed me
all the 7 patches in individual files, I could test them one by one.
