Traditionally in Linux f_bsize in struct statfs is used as FS block size.
(e.g. df calculates fs capacity by multiplying amount of blocks on
fs by f_bsize).
Actually, this is the only field in struct statfs that holds any data regarding
fs blocksize. (well, some arches have f_frsize, but it is marked as unused).
