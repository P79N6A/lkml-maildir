Hello,
I am using an ISA modem on a linux m/c. I have opened a
device eg. /dev/ttyS3 from the user level using open
function. 
However because of some limitation, I want to operate the
modem in a polled mode. I have the following problems :
1) Can I disable the interrupts on the modem (UART - IER
register) from the user level using some call (eg ioctl or
anything like this)
2) If the interrupts are disabled, how do I read the data in
the UART FIFO.
Please help.
Thanks,
Girish
