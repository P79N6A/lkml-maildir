And because making such distinction is pointless, since the GPL'd
wrapper and the core driver would not be distributed 'as separate works'
but rather 'as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program',
where the Program in this case is the GPL'd wrapper part. 
Hence under the terms of the final paragraph of section 2 of the GPL,
the code of the driver would also have to be released under the same
terms.
