True, but abusing EMBEDDED for "only do that if you know what you are
doing and if it breaks, you have to keep the pieces" is not good
either. 
Some other places that seem to fall into the same category are
IPX_INTERN ("...This might break existing applications...") which is
neither EMBEDDED nor EXPERIMENTAL or RMW_INSNS ("...It is very likely
that this will cause serious problems on any Amiga...") that is
dependent on ADVANCED.
Anyway, perhaps I should just select EMBEDDED although I don't have a
small system (though a 6 year old 1Ghz K7 with 1GB mem might be
considered small by some people these days :-), and ignore all the other
options that pop up through this.
Best,
  Norbert
