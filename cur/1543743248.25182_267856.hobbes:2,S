[SNIPPED....]
There is no problem killing a task and freeing its resources.
The problem is that Linux and other Unix variations need to
do this in a specific manner. That manner being that some
parent (or ultimately init) needs to receive the terminating
status. A task that has been otherwise killed, but is awaiting
its status to be obtained is in the 'Z' or zombie state. If
the code for either the child task or its parent was improperly
written, the death of a parent could allow a child to wait
forever (zombie).
The fix is to fix the code. Your temporary fix is to use
Ctrl-Alt-backspace to kill the X11 server (the parent).
If it doesn't restart (it's not a kernel problem, it's
a distribution problem), you can log in as root and
execute:
 	/etc/X11/prefdm &
All these little windows and icons are the 'children' of
the X server. The above is a temporary work-around for
a non-kernel problem.
