There is something definitely now even more broken with test8pre4.
I just upgraded to test8pre4 from test7 and was reading this and some
other emails with mutt.  Upon quiting mutt, mutt reported that there was
some sort of error while attempting to write the folder.  My folder now
looks like this:
<1073152 bytes of the start of original folder>
<67045376 bytes of NULL (0x00)>
<51704 bytes of the end of the original folder>
Obviously, the folder was in need of some pruning to begin with, but this
pruned a bit more than I would have liked.
I'm not exactly sure how this happened, but it definitely didn't happen
before with test7.
