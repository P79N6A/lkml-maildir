Responding to my own post under this heading, I googled my way to Peter
Seiderers recent posts under "What is the difference between 'login: root'
and 'su -' ?".  I find that dd works when I login as root rather than su. 
FWIW I also worked out that, when using su, dd was failing on the 2GB
boundary.  Anyway, whatever the causes, that seems to solve my problem from
a practical point of view.
Regards,
Geoff
