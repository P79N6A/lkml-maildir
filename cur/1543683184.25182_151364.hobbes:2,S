And more importantly, what would you put the data back *INTO*?
There's no guarantee that said patent doesn't also screw over all CVS users,
or SCCS, or what have you.
Also, there's a *very* good chance that any patent that hits BK would *also*
afflict a BK clone, unless they were lucky enough to use a totally different
algorithm to achieve the same on-the-wire result.  And if the patent is against
the *idea* of doing XYZ with a computer, then the algorithm won't matter anyhow.
