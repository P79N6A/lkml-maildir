There have been some "interesting" discussions about HP printers on the
linux-usb-devel mailing list :)
A very simple patch that might work for you is at:
	http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-usb-devel&m=101338636901219
while a more "correct" patch is at:
	http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-usb-devel&m=101366701613394
Please let me know if either of these patches fix your problem.
thanks,
