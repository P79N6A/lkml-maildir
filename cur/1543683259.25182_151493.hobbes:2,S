Exactly, this is why I think that we should make the counters 64-bits right 
now, so that we don't have to worry about them later - when it will be 
required to have them 64-bits long.

Per cpu variables with global overflow seem to be the way to go (at least for 
the network statistics.)

Very interesting, the same thing that "was supposed to be done" in user space, 
but modular and in the kernel itself...I am impressed.

Overall, great idea! 
We basically have a choice:
- - 32-bit counters with overflows every 4GB and instantenious (sp?) stats
- - 64-bit counters with overflows every 16PB and possibility of stats being off 
a bit
