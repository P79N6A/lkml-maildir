Don't know about software sniffing but hardware sniffing of RS-232 is 
relatively simple. Splice in a "Y" cable and configure a serial port 
of another device to listen. Of course, you'll have to configure the 
serial port to the same rate, parity and stop bits but that's usually 
easy. Cut the transmit wire on the sniffer side to ensure nothing 
outbound succeeds in leaving the sniffer machine. Listening to both 
sides of the conversation would require two sniffer devices, or at 
least two serial ports.
