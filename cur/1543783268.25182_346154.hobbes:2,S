Good idea. In fact I always hated the behaviour of the existing
hotplug code that assumes all possible CPUs can be hotplugged.
It would be much nicer to be told be the firmware what CPUs
are hotpluggable. It would be great if all ia32/x86-64 hotplug capable 
BIOS behaved like your.

This should be in some header.

Why this change? It seems unrelated.

This looks wrong. The CPUs should be in the present mask
if it's present. Followup code similar.
BTW shouldn't there be some attribute in sysfs that says
"CPU disabled"?
