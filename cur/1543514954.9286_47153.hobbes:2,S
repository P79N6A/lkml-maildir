Hi,
Interestingly, if one manually forces "mem=64M" at boot, it works. So, I
am satisfied with 2.3.25 (i.e. all known to me problems since 2.3.18 are
gone, except the larg disk stuff but "linear" option in LILO workarounds
it (with a dangerous kernel message but my systems usually live not
much longer than a few days so a complete reinstall will cure it anyway)).
Regards,
Tigran.
