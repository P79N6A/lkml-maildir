  This might be arguable but better 31-bits than 26 :-).

  Yes. But usage ~50% isn't so bad... I'll write hash table and benchmark it
at least :-).

  It won't be much slower that current implementation as it climbs tree. But
this is hidden in ext2 implementation :-). I see the main problem in inserts
and deletes. I agree they are not very often but spending 2 seconds on one
insert seems too much to me :-). I'm searching the net for some interresting
structures :-).
