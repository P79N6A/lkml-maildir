	Don't mark it experimental anymore and avoid changing the ll_rw_block
	queue changes in this patch, return to the mainline values. If needed
	they should go into a separate patch for clarity.
	Use CONFIG_DISCONTIGMEM for some microoptimization.

	Fixed a few bugs in the block_prepare_write while dealing with
