I think the hibernation kernel should mmap() the "old" kernel's (and it's
processes') memory available for saving, so that the image-saving process
can read its contents from the original locations.

There are two approaches.  In the first of them (used in the mainline) we just
create copies of all pages eligible for saving (hence we can't create images
larger than 50% of RAM) atomically and then we save the contents of these
copies (either directly from the kernel or through a user space process).  This
way we don't need to worry that they may be modified before we can save
them.
The other approach is the Nigel's one, in which all LRU pages are first saved
and then used as additional storage for copying the rest of memory contents.
This has a drawback that we are not 100% sure if the LRU won't be modified
after we've used them to store the copies of the other pages.

No, it's just bitmaps, AFAICS, and the complaints are a bit overstated, IMO. ;-)

We have quite an efficient restoration code in the kernel right now.  It's
able to upload big images (something like total RAM minus the size of the
boot kernel, initrd and, optionally, the resume application), which is much
more than we're able to save. :-)
It can work with images uploaded via /dev/snapshot from the user space
(specific image format is required, but that can be changed easily).
