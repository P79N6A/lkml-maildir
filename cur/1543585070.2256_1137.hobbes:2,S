Yes i think so.
First are two RAM expansion in my Thinkpad
Second is the memora on the mainboard
Third is the AGP-Video-Card memory !?
reg00: base=0x00000000 (   0MB), size= 256MB: write-back, count=1
reg01: base=0x10000000 ( 256MB), size=  64MB: write-back, count=1
reg02: base=0xe0000000 (3584MB), size=   4MB: write-combining, count=1
Same for 2.4.2 without ac patches.
