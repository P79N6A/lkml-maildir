Sightly off-topic: As one of those "64-bit Linux" types, I'd be happy with
just "all Linux" portability.  Even though Linux has existed on 64-bit CPU's
for three years, now, programmers feel it's quite OK to assume that a "long"
or a "char *" is 32 bits.
More to the point, divergences POSIX should be noted.  Linux has never
claimed to be SysV, BSD, or (heaven forbid) Win32.  But it claims POSIX
compliance, so it can be quite useful to note differences (even happy
ones) from that standard.
As someone who has seen the hubris of numerous Unix vendors in assuming
that portability isn't their problem--especially when it comes to
documentation--it pains me when Linux folks take a similar tack.  Looked
at from the perspective of someone coming to Linux from elsewhere in
the Unix world, your attitude looks downright hostile.  Such attitudes
belong on Slashdot, not here.
