I don't know if that's an option on the power architecture.
And we need larger atomic types _anyway_ for page->_count.  An unprivileged
app can mmap the same page 4G times and can then munmap it once.  Do it on
purpose and it's a security hole.  Due it by accident and it's a crash.

atomic64_t already appears to be implemented on alpha, ia64, mips, s390 and
sparc64.
As I said - for both these applications we need a new type which is
atomic64_t on 64-bit and atomic_t on 32-bit.
