I have always been under the impression that PS2 devices were not
hotplugable at all.
Many machines stop responding on the ps2 mouse port if you disconnect
and reconnect the mouse.  KVMs of course cause lots of trouble too for
that if they don't somehow fake the mouse still being present.
It works on some systems, but in my experience you don't touch ps/2
mice with the power on.
