We've done some more detective work. I can reproduce the hang too
by quitting the ftp client abruptly (^Z and kill %1 in my case).
Inducing the hang while stracing the daemon shows a recv returning 0
as expected when the socket closes. The daemon then calls "die":
    die(const char* p_text)
    {
      /* Going down hard... */
    #ifdef DIE_DEBUG
      bug(p_text);
    #endif
and DIE_DEBUG is defined. bug() writes an error message and then does
three things:
    shutdown(2) on the sockets
    close(2) on the sockets
    abort()
the last of which libc implements as
    rt_sigprocmask(SIG_UNBLOCK, [SIGABRT])
    kill(getpid(), SIGABRT)
Here's the interesting thing: doing an exit(0) before the shutdowns
and abort gets rid of the hang. The only unusual and potentially
untested thing I could find about the program was that it uses
capset() and prctl(PR_SET_KEEPCAPS). However, replacing the
"retval = capset(...)" call with a dummy "retval = 0" doesn't get
rid of the hang. So it looks as though some combination of
shutdown(2) and SIGABRT is at fault. After the hang the kernel-side
stack trace is always either the one I gave above (and I *did*
write down the address for inet_ioctl correctly; it's definitely
not inet_shutdown) or else
  do_exit <- do_signal <- schedule <- syscall_trace <- signal_return
(with exactly the same addresses as above except for the differing
schedule and syscall_trace ones) which appeared after the hang while
vsftpd was being run under strace.
