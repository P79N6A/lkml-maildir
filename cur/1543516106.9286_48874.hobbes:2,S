Greetings to all!
I was trying to manage processes purely from user space for my research
project and bumped into a policy that seems a little strange to me. Linux
lets users only lower priority of their processes. Now, once the priority
is lowered, you can't raise it back. Why not?! Why can't a user
raise/lower priority within certain limits (say, default max priority for
a given user)? Isn't it time to separate mechanism from policy in this
case?
Sincerely,
Anatoly Akkerman.
