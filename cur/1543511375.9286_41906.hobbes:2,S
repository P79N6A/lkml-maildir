I didn't look at the networking code specifically, I was talking in
general. Yes, the coding style in the kernel is almost uniformly excellent,
though not quite uniform.

Very true. But if it is too hard to figure out what they do and how the
whole hangs together (the names _can_ be very strong clues), there should
be some dictionary at hand. As a russian writing code in English you know
that :-)
Somebody suggested renaming them, and #define'ing the old names to the new
ones for a transition period, say during 2.5, and then wasting the old
names in 2.7 for 2.8. What is your opinion on that? I can understand that
as you work on this, you've very familiar with the current names, but
please do consider the plight of newcomers that try to work their way into
it. If it is gratuitously too hard, you're turning away possible future
valuable developers, and reducing the number of eyes that look it over and
find bugs.
