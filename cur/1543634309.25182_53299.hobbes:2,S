Yep, a me-to I'm afraid.  We had the problem with an eepro100 on-board a 
motherboard.  Worked fine except when we copied large files and then it 
would start randomly timing out on smb/NFS.
Tried new kernels (2.4.16 I think was the last I tried); was mainly 
using the Intel drivers that were in SuSE kernels.
In the end we gave up and put a 3com 3c905 in - it has been fine ever since.

P.S. I'm not in a situation to try anthing more withit since it is a 
production server.
