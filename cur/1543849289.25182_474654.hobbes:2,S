OK, but this is still mountable only from windows....... Is this ISO
filesystem hidden somewhere, or what? And that still does not explain
errors from xine, and the 8 megs that i actually can read using dd.
All after all - even if this disc would contain totally unsupported
tracks, with absolutly weird data, kernel should recognize it and
report something like:
cdrom: there are no tracks on hda i can recognize
(or something like that). If the errors do happen, it means kernel
thinks he can read the data, and he actually can't, yes? Is here
anything I can do to improve support of this disc under linux, or is
this just another hell-knows-what thing, the kernel implementation is
ok, and this is only some m$-dontated extension that prevents us from
accessing this disc? Even if it is, shouldn't it be implemented if it
is possible?
Thanks
