I don't think it is Jeff who needs to fix anything: it seems that it is 
Chuck Ebbert you should talk to. He's the one that dropped the 
attribution. Probably because of some insane system he uses (he has a 
comment in that bugzilla about "patch from comment #14 is in CVS now.".
CVS? What kind if insane setup do you have there at Red Hat?
