Yes, the basic console will only require a few helpers. I get "tons" because 
that's what it would take to provide all the acceleration features to 
userspace. The daemon is *only* there to provide those acceleration features. 
The kernel itself has it's own minimal interface to drmcon that lets it work 
without userspace. The userspace side is for userspace. (Though the kernel 
will only work in a specific set mode without the userspace helpers for 
setting the mode)
Cursor control will be entirely within the driver :)

Hrm... I was thinking that it didn't work for sending to net and serial 
consoles because doing such might generate an interrupt.

Of course. It is one of my goals to keep those silent deaths from occuring. 
AAMOF, that was one of my reasons for this project.
