As Linus and others pointed out, copy_{to_from}_user has its uses and will
stay, but something like:
#define copyin(...) (copy_from_user(...) ? -EFAULT : 0)
#define copyout(...) (copy_to_user(...) ? -EFAULT : 0)
Like several drivers already have (with these names or with other names)
would be something interesting, that way we could clean up the ones that
use this construct and all the others that use the longer
'copy_{to,from}_user(...) ? -EFAULT : 0' construct. If the powers that be
accept this, I'd do the work 8)
Is it *BSD that have copyin/copyout with this semantic? If so it'd even
have an extra bonus to make porting a little bit faster... 8)
