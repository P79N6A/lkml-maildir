Not easily.  We've got a very cool pid-dispenser at this point that
has excellent performance and scalability, but requires a bit map,
one bit per potential pid.  That bitmap can't exceed a small percentage
of main memory on most any configuration, constraining us to perhaps
20 to 30 bits.  The code currently has a 22 bit arbitrary limit.
Something like 30 bits would usually only make sense on the terabyte
NUMA monster boxes.
128-bit UUID technology scales fine, but adds quite a few compute
cycles per allocation, and would blow out a whole lot of user code
expecting to put a pid in a machine word.
