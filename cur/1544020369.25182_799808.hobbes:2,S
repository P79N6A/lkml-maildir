1) process wide itimers are rubbish, 2) per-cpu itimers are rubbish too,
for the very simple reason they waste gobs of memory for sane programs.
I would rather go back to the old model where we iterate all threads,
and find a way to not make programs with too many threads for their own
good lock up the kernel, but instead get poor service.
Now the problems appears to be that I overlooked that we keep the itimer
clock running at all times, not only when we have a pending timer, and I
suppose that the standard mandates that behaviour :/
Anyway, I will try to sort something out, at worst we'll have to revert
to the .28 state and live with the per-cpu crap for another release.
