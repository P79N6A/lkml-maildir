The issue was somewhat confused by people certainly *reporting* it for 
older kernels. Also, as part of the dirty bit cleanups and sanity 
checkingwe did actually seem to fix a long-standing CIFS corruption (and 
apparently reisertfs/XFS problems too).
But the *common* case was actually introduced with 2.6.19, and 2.6.16 
wouldn't be affected.
