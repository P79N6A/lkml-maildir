This is a similar sort of thing to what I've been testing out lately
in the NFSv3 patches (following Frank van Maarseveen's suggestion on
linux-kernel). I include it for comparison purposes. It seems to me
like the right sort of approach for this issue since it gets rid of
the arbitrary limit for revalidation, and fulfills the expectations of
people mounting with 'noac' or acdirmin = 0.
Of course, NFS being a stateless filesystem means that relying on this
--especially for file locking issues etc-- is a bug.
Cheers,
  Trond
