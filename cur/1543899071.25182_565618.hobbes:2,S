Because we will be unable to escape that job. Let's assume that
we remove the freezer from the STR path. The next complaint would
be that we cannot do STD with fuse. "Then don't do that" would not
be taken kindly as answer.
So we would be under pressure to remove the freezer from STD, too,
or find a way to make the freezer work. If we'd have to make the freezer
work anyway, we can do it right now.
