Here we go.

Quanta

There do seem to be other systems, besides mine, that have the same 
problem.  I think it's pretty likely that other machines that have this 
problem are Quanta machines, since Quanta is one of the primary ODM's 
that does HP laptops.   Don't know about the product-name being common 
with the HP dv6000z family, which is another one reported to have this 
problem.  We could try to ask all the reporters of hwclock freezes to 
report their results from dmidecode.
