System:
  Tyan 2466 MPX board, 2 Athlon 1800MP, bios 1.01 from March 2002
  1 gb ram, ibm + maxtor ide disks, ide cdrom + cdrw 
  ati rage 128, sb pci 128, on-board 3c905 nic, ps/2 mouse
  no other cards
  hardware configuration unaltered since June of last year
Enabling or disabling the HIGHME patch is enough to trigger/suppress
hard locking.  When HIGHMEM is enabled, locking occurs very easily when
trying to copy a (cloop-mounted) Knoppix image, or even when compiling
a kernel.
I run fairly stock kernels (from Debian kernel source packages) with the 
win4lin patch as the only external patch.  ACPI is disabled. Disk access is
not tuned in any way, DMA gets enabled by default.
