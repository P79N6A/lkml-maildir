James, just check and you will see, buffered I/O is a lot faster.

Err, to whom return? If you try to read from a mmaped page, which can't 
be populated due to I/O error, you will get SIGBUS or SIGSEGV, I don't 
remember exactly. It's quite tricky to get back to the faulted command 
from the signal handler.
Or do you mean mmap(MAP_POPULATE)/munmap() for each command? Do you 
think that such mapping/unmapping is good for performance?

Hmm, how can one write to an mmaped page and don't touch it?
