  i notice, in kernel/timer.c, the kernel-doc comment for
do_gettimeofday():
  NOTE: Users should be converted to using get_realtime_clock_ts()
does this mean that do_gettimeofday() should be officially deprecated?
that *seems* to be what that note is suggesting.
  in any event, there is no "get_realtime_clock_ts" routine -- it's
actually called "__get_realtime_clock_ts".  so *something* should be
fixed here, no?
