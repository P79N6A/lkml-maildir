I'm pretty sure we're talking about two different things - I don't
understand what you mean about all the exisiting models.  Are you
saying that with Adrian's patch we still can't simply include this
workaround [1] if and only if the user has included Athlon support,
rather than CPU<=Athlon?
[1] Obviously the point isn't just applicable to this work around, but
this is a new one going in.
John.
