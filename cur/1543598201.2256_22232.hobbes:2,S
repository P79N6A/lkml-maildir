Not knowingly, no.  Is that a mount option?  I'm mounting them the

Heh, not much more useful:
# tune2fs -l /dev/hdd1
tune2fs 1.22, 22-Jun-2001 for EXT2 FS 0.5b, 95/08/09
tune2fs: Filesystem has unsupported feature(s) while trying to open /dev/hdd1
Couldn't find valid filesystem superblock.
I'll probably have to take the drive back, and see if it now mounts
in the original system :-/
