Jason, can you please save the boot messages from both 2.4.25 and 2.4.26? 
Maybe you have a serial console around or at least you copy the relevant 
parts (the card detection success with 2.4.25 and the card detection failure 
with 2.4.26), plus the config files for both cases, and send us?
That would be helpful. There are no aic7xxx changes in 2.4.26. Are you using ACPI?
