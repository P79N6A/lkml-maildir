eike@bilbo:/mnt/kernel/linux-2.6.0-test4> find . -name Kconfig | xargs grep -B 2 "depends .*X86_IO_APIC"
./drivers/pci/hotplug/Kconfig-config HOTPLUG_PCI_IBM
./drivers/pci/hotplug/Kconfig-  tristate "IBM PCI Hotplug driver"
./drivers/pci/hotplug/Kconfig:  depends on HOTPLUG_PCI && X86_IO_APIC && X86
Maybe you set HOTPLUG_PCI_IBM to yes?
