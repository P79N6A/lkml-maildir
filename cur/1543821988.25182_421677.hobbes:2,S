The main issue I see with the "enable" sysfs attribute is that it doesn't
mediate who has ownership of the device's state and context, as Jon has
mentioned.  As a result, userspace might, not knowing any better, disable
the device while its kernel driver is trying to access it, or a number of
other fatal senarios.
However, I understand that video is not the only issue at hand, and there is
some interest in userspace PCI drivers.  At the very least, we should prevent
any writing to the "enable" attribute if a kernelspace driver is bound to
the device.  This patch completely ignores such issues.
We might want to take this a step further and create a generic PCI userspace
kernel driver that exports knobs such as "enable" in sysfs and also handles
some baseline suspend/resume behavior and whatever else is needed for
userspace drivers.  This will ensure that the kernel is aware that the
hardware is owned by a userspace driver, and it will make it clear to a user
app that it is allowed to control the device.
Thanks,
Adam
