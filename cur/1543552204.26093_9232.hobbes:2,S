The only correct way to get the IRQ number for a given PCI card is to look
to the pci_dev structure. This holds for both 2.2 and 2.4 kernels. (The main
reason being that on some architectures the interrupt number doesn't fit
in a single byte.)
If you know of any drivers reading interrupt line information from the
configuration space, please tell us and we'll fix them.
				Have a nice fortnight
