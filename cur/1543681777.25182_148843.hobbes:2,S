Hi Zwane, thanks for the reply.
Ok, I just reproduced it. The last lines in /v/l/messages just after 
entering the password in xscreensaver are:
Jul 16 20:27:11 hobbes xscreensaver(pam_unix)[1503]: authentication 
failure; logname= uid=501 euid=501 tty=:0.0 ruser= rhost=  user=root

Jul 16 20:28:58 hobbes modprobe: FATAL: Module /dev/pts0 not found.
in /v/l/syslog:

and the last lines in /v/l/XFree86.log are:

(WW) Open APM failed (/dev/apm_bios) (No such file or directory)
The apm bit is funny. I certainly dont have any apm stuff in the kernel. 
This is a regular desktop machine, an amd xp 3200/asus a7v8x board.
Also, i'm attaching a strace log of the xscreensaver process -- i hung it 
entering the password, switched to the console, strace'd it and killed it 
while being traced. I hope it can be useful. The log is slightly edited 
tho, to remove my password.
Ah, one more thing. After killing the xscreensaver process and returning 
to X, the keyboard wont work with some apps -- I can type just fine on 
aterm, for example, but not on balsa or xchat, as all the keypresses on 
those two programs will appear on aterm.
Let me know if you need more info, .config, etc.
