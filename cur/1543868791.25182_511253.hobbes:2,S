Subject: [ANNOUNCE] Guilt v0.20
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Guilt v0.20 is available for download (once it mirrors out on kernel.org).
Guilt (Git Quilt) is a series of bash scripts which add a Mercurial
queues-like functionality and interface to git.
Tarballs:

Git repo:
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/jsipek/guilt.git
Pretty much all the changes are related to the patchbomb and import-commit
scripts. They now take a range of commits in one of these formats:
      <hash>		- one commit
      <hash>..		- hash until head (excludes hash, includes head)
      ..<hash>		- until hash (includes hash)
      <hash1>..<hash2>	- from hash to hash (inclusive)
Josef "Jeff" Sipek.
