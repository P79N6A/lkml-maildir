| For completeness could you test the OSS emu10k driver (which supports

| driver
| isn't perfect and neither are xine or mplayer so I'd like figure out
| what  exactly  is going on here.  I'll of course do the same.  It's just
| kind of hard to judge for me seeing as my system is now 4 years old.
I dont think it would make a difference sice cpu-time used by system is
really low since switching off mmap. But my overall experience with the
emu10k1 alsa-driver since it hit version 1.0 is quite good (before there
where some issues or should I say "annoyances" with the mixer). But if
you really want this I can rebuild my kernel and swith all that
oss-stuff back on ;)
