Hm, sorry if I sound like I do not want something "so great".  I do.  I
just do not ever want to compromise the existing code... I would much
prefer to say "wow we cannot do this cleanly now, let's wait until we
figure out a clean way".
Anyhow, one of us is confused.  How can this in_atomic() test _ever_
catch a preemption bug?  We cannot enter the scheduler off kernel
preemption unless preempt_count==0.  This is a test to catch bugs in
other parts of the kernel, e.g. where code explicitly calls schedule()
while holding a lock.
