Hello,
the problem with bouncing keys I reported with 2.6.11-rc5 is still
present in 2.6.11. Additionally, I noticed that audio has short outages
every few seconds, which sound like latency problems would do.
And I saw with 'top' that often, when the sound skips, the kacpid process
shows up using a big percentage of CPU time. (Perhaps it's always the kacpid
waking up, but 'top' is just to slow to show it accurately)
Have there been changes between 2.6.10 and 2.6.11-rc5 which could cause
these problems, perhaps together with ACPI bugs on the ASUS M2400N or
anything like that? I'd be happy helping to debug this, if anybody could
give me a hint where to start.
Yours,
Jan
