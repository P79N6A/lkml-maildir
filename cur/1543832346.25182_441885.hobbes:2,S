However it does seem to be good for some things, as you say.
The volatile casting in atomic_* and *_bit seems to be a good idea
(now that I think about it) [1].
Because if you had a barrier there, you'd have to reload everything
used after an atomic_read or set_bit, etc.
But it might be nice to wrap that in something rather than use
volatile directly. force_reload(wordptr); maybe?
[1] Even though I still can't tell the exact semantics of these
     operations eg. why do we need volatile at all? why do we have
     volatile in the double underscore (non-atomic) versions?
