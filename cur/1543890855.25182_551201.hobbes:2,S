Yes, one can try to satisfy the users/callers by adapting to their
needs (wishes), which requires parameters or such; or one can have
no callers and end up with (around 11 currently) different hex dump
functions in the kernel source tree, but no users of lib/hexdump.c.
But it won't take much more "requirements" for me to drop the patch.

The label has another reference already, so it wouldn't be lost.
But the if (ascii) block could be added...
