Great, that's much better.  I'll give it a try.

Fully agreed.

I don't really follow what you mean here.  Do you mean with the tailing
slash normalized, modpost doesn't work anymore?  Or with the
normalization removed?

s/module/component which can be a dynamically loadable module or
built-in to the kernel/ in my original sentence.  I just couldn't find a
good word to use.  So, you're saying subdir-ym's can be dropped from
modorder, right?  It would be great if we can implement a safeguard to
check that subdif-ym's don't actually contain modules.
Thanks.
