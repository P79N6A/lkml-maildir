We are not trying to change the current profiling infrastructure.  We
are trying to enhance the existing event notification scheme to handle
more events.

The current event notifications used by tools like Oprofile, while quite
useful, are not sufficient.  The additional event notifications we
propose can provide a more complete picture for performance tuning on
Linux, particularly for dynamically generated code (such as found in
Java).  
In addition to allowing for the enhancement of current performance
tools, it also enables creation of new tools to gather measurements that
were previously difficult to obtain (e.g., "image loads per second").
