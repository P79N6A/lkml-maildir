Midi's baud rate isn't 38,400, its 31,250.  Check your
references.  It should be in any keyboards manual.

Well, it is pretty slow for a non multiuser os equipt with todays
hardware.

I don't want to bring politics into this group it has no place
here.  None, nada.   But, since you mentioned it, screw Ashcroft

democracy to its knees in 4 years than all others before him in
our 230 years.
