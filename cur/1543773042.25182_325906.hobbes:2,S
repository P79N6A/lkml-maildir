Hi,
I have the following issues with the patch:
- since "persistency" (or rather repeat loading) is controlled from
  userspace, drivers don't have control over it. This way every user
  of request_firmware_nowait has to be ready to process more than one
  firmware load.
- There is no way to "cancel" firmware request from the driver. You
  will not be able to safely unload users of request_firmware_nowait().
  Since loader is rearming you can't use firmware handler function to
  signal when request has been processed.
I think that such re-arming reqests are much better implemented in
individual drivers.
