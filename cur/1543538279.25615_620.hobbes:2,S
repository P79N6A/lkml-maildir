Subject: features and patch fights fixable by menuconfig or something like?

First: I know little about kernel internals.
There have been two big arguments in a row now about spiffy new kernel
features and when/whether they should be integrated.  It seems to me that
the argument could be sidestepped nicely by distributing patches with the
kernel and a little bit of work on menuconfig to allow users to easily use
patches if they want (with big warning or whatever).
Selfish motivation: I am highly interested in the low latency patch, but I
didn't even know it existed until the argument here.  I'm not clueless (in
fact I am just finishing up my own humble audio app which does the
buffered playing recording that has been discussed, this does indeed work
beautifully on stock linux), but I simply havn't had time to poke around
and investigate/play with kernel patches.  I think there are lots of users
like me.
If these things could be menuconfig options, then we could let natural
selection determine which ones have the highest maintainability/user
demand indexes, without any penalty to maintainers of the core kernel.
On the other hand, if the 'band-aid' problem mentioned applies to user
feature addiction as well as just the unlikelyhood of a patch ever being
backed out once its welded in, I guess this won't work.
