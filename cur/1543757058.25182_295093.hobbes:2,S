Then do the shifts in the other order, first 2->1, then 3->2, ...
So now you ask, what if you are doing a rotation?  Use a temporary
node: 2->tmp, 3->2, ..., N->(N-1), tmp->N.
So now you ask, what if you are doing a rotation involving _all_
nodes, and have nothing you can use as a temporary node?
Argh I say ... would anyone really do that?  Or perhaps it makes
sense to have the system call take a virtual address range (and
hence a pid).  In which case, you can do one page at a time, if
need be, and get any foolhardy migration possible.
Or perhaps some integration with Andi's mbind/mempolicy make sense.
I'm not quite following Andi's comments on this, so I can't say
one way or the other if this is good.
