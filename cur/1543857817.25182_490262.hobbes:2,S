Trying to work on it - not making a lot of progress.   I find it hard
to see how anything in md can cause the inode for a block-device file
to disappear...
It is a bit of a long-shot, but this patch might change things.  It
changes the order in which things are de-allocated.
Jiri and Jiri: would either of both of you see if you can reproduce
the bug with this patch on 2.6.19-rc6-mm2 ???
