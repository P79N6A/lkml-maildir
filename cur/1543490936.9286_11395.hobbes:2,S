ONE-ONE is the only thing, which ROUTE_NAT is able. It is supposed to be
used for site renumbering and to facilitate policy routing, rather
then to compress ip address space or to split load.
The setup is very easy: micro-howto may be found
at 
http://www.compendium.com.ar/policy-routing.txt
It is very small, but contains basic hints.

I failed to parse it, but try to continue 8)
- it is stateless to be scalable. -> no dynamic nat, no load splitting.
- it does not touch packet payload to be fast and does not check
  it to be not ambigous. -> no active ftp in one direction and no passive
			    in backward.
- it is not intended to remap only range of ports, though
  it is possible with fwmark.
