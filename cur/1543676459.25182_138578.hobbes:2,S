Not that I'm aware of, and I'd argue that it's probably not
a good idea to try and do it inside the FS.

The closest would probably be how programs such as GNU parted resize
partitions.
There are many optimizations that you could do to the average FAT/VFAT
filesystem. From making files contiguous, grouping files that are in
the same directory, ordering the directory lists etc.
Although one would have to question the usefulness of this kind of software these days. The number of new VFAT filesystems is getting smaller by the month (except on CF cards in cameras and the like - and they'd be re mkfs'd pretty often so wouldn't suffer too much from the performance degredation of continuous use).
I'd argue that testing/bug fixing ntfsresize would be of more use - especially in converting eXtra Poo users. :)

This would not do a 'complete' optimization... but probably would help.
