Well, I'm okay either way.  It's not like one way is undisputably better
than the other but we're leaning toward accepting NULL argument in this
type of functions.  Think about kfree(NULL) and its usefulness.  More
importantly, the ecosystem around sysfs - that is, kobject, driver model
- generally accepts NULL argument for their get/put functions, so unless
there's a compelling reason to convert them all, and I don't see any,
sysfs_put() needs to follow the same rule.
