In the 2.2 code (ext3-0.0.7a), the journal has to be part of the
filesystem.  The current e2fsprogs and 2.4 ext3 code (ext3-0.9.9) does
support journals on other devices, but there's more support to be
added before it's truly complete (in particular we want to support
several filesystems journaling to a single shared journal spool.)
The separate-journal-disk code hasn't been tested as much as the
default journal-on-main-filesystem code, and it's not officially
supported, so the format might change in the future.  But it should
work.
Cheers,
 Stephen
