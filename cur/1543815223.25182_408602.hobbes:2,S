Hello,
I don't understand why you are working so hard on this... If
you want encryption, you should care about all of your data!
And if you encrypt all your data, you automatically get a
suspend image encryption...
Please have a look at
http://wiki.suspend2.net/EncryptedSwapAndRoot
I use loop-aes in order to do the job... I know... I know...
You don't like suspend2... But it should be basically the
same with swsusp1/2/3/N.
Best Regards,
Alon Bar-Lev.
