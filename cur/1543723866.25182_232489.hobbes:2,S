Thanks Maneesh :) Anton brightly explained me readdir : it can be called
more than once (buffering ...) so the reason for that offset.Action
taking place in filldir return.'over' in ext2 readdir could bring
confusion though....It's 'over' for kernel duty but the whole path is
not necessarily explored yet.
I think the trivial comment patch attached (against 2.6.7-mm6) could be
interesting for that issue.
