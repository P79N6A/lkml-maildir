I probably encountered it the other day, but as I couldn't explain what
was happening, I mistakenly concluded to a user error and started again
from a fresh tree. Or maybe it was really a user error after all.
I was about to suggest that we add a test in the quilt test suite, but I
see you did already - good!

I'd say:
* Fix the temporary file leak in the mail command I have been reporting a
few days ago - unless it's there on purpose.
* Update the translations. I'll take care of French this evening
(GMT+01).
* Let people (including me) do a little testing. If nothing else, running
the test suite on a few different systems can't hurt.
* Release.
We can be done by tomorrow if Yashi can handle the Japanese translation
fast. If Yashi is too busy I guess we'll have to release anyway...
Thanks,
