Is 32 bit UID support being built into the 2.3.x kernel? Chris Wing at the
University of Michigan is providing some hacks to the glib libraries and
kernel for 2.2.x to support 32 bit uid ( URLs below ) What are the chances
of getting this into the 2.3.x kernel?

The installation instructions are the same as for the linux 2.0 stuff:
