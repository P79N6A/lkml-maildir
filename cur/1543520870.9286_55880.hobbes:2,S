Subject: devel kernel ppp bug

I recently compiled 2.3.36 to find this error when the pppd was called: 
    (root)[~]#ppp-go 
    (root)[~]#Serial connection established. 
    ioctl(TIOCSETD): Invalid argument(22) 
Considering I was using slackware's ppp-go script, I used minicom, then
tried to call the pppd by hand, and still received the same error. I also, updated from pppd 2.3.10 to pppd 2.3.11 and did a make kernel, then recompiled the kernel and received the same error. I understand that ioctl is a C function, and this is most likely a pppd error. Strange thing is,that it works with all other kernels, including 2.3.34 and 2.3.35. 
    Happy Coding!
