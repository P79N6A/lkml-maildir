Exactly.  I hope you take a close look at  
drivers/video/backlight/backlight.c and drivers/video/backlight/lcd.c and  
how it uses the class device.  Neither does not create anything in /dev.   
The model and design that is used in the backlight.c and lcd.c code is also  
being used in some (currently out of tree) new code I am working on.   
Either continue to support the current class API or provide a design and  
API that works with backlight.c
