I don't know. He said that the network stack  has
absolute priority, so perhaps he can explain why
compiling a kernel causes an exponential increase
in packet loss? 
The FreeBSD "network maintainers" are largely
clueless about just about every problem in 5.x,
so I'm not sure the title qualifies someone as
knowing all there is to know. I haven't heard him
claim that he can do the things I'm doing without
any receive errors or drops. I'd like to hear
about what test he runs to test this sort of
problem.
Before you can solve a problem you have to have a
clear understanding of what the problem is, and
admit that you have a problem.

I didn't refuse. I just chose to take help from
Ben, because Ben took the time to reproduce the
problem and to provide useful settings that made
sense to me. There's nothing wrong with my
machine. 
I don't know who is who; I judge people based on
the intelligence of their analysis. People
responsible for the network stack may not be the
right people, because this is more likely a
scheduler issue. There's probably nothing wrong
with the stack or the drivers; the machine just
doesn't react fast enough to avert ring overruns.
