I think you are trying to validate addresses to be passed into kprobes.
In that context, you need to check if the given address is a kernel
space code address. 
Take a look at kernel_text_address() functions in 
arch/i386/kernel/traps.c which do this. Unfortunately, they are defined
static inline, so, they can't be used outside of traps.c. You may
want to export that function from kernel and use it in your driver.
Cheers,
Vamsi.
