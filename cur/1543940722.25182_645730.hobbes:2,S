Don't forget the network overhead: 
http://sd.wareonearth.com/~phil/net/overhead/
 Max TCP Payload data rates over ethernet:
  (1500-40)/(38+1500) = 94.9285 %  IPv4, minimal headers
  (1500-52)/(38+1500) = 94.1482 %  IPv4, TCP timestamps
I believe what you are seeing is an effect that occurs when using
cubic on links with no other idle traffic. With two flows at high speed,
the first flow consumes most of the router buffer and backs off gradually,
and the second flow is not very aggressive.  It has been discussed
back and forth between TCP researchers with no agreement, one side
says that it is unfairness and the other side says it is not a problem in
the real world because of the presence of background traffic.
