No. The situation is just black. Each day Intel processors are a bigger
pile of crap and less intelligent, but MHz compensate for the average
office user. Think of what could a P4 do if the same effort put on
Hz was put on getting cheap a cache of 4Mb or 8Mb like MIPSes have. Or
closer, 1Mb like G4s.
If syscalls take 300% time but processor is also 300% faster 'nobody
notices'.
