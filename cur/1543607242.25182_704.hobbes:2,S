Subject: 2.4.12 not mounting root initrd with highmem 4G enabled (686)

in the ac line of kernels, i have been unable to get my
kernel to "boot". it says that the initrd image was not found at 0,
and then tries to mount alternate devices (which it can not because the
ext3, and ide drivers are configured to load via initrd).
i have CONFIG_HIGHMEM, CONFIG_HIGHMEM_4G, CONFIG_CRAMFS, and
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_INITRD all set y, with CONFIG_BLK_DEV_RAM_SIZE=4096.
my initrd image is created with
mkinitrd -v -o /boot/initrd-2.4.12-ac5 /lib/modules/2.4.12-ac5 && lilo
no errors are reported at this level.. mkcramfs is v2.4.12, mkinitrd is
v1.19.
I assume this is because of the HIGHMEM option as this is the only thing I
have changed.  I have tried this on various 2.4.11 (ac), and 2.4.12 (ac)
versions.
ideas?
