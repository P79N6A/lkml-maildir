Indeed, TiVO has this legal right.  But then they must not use
software under the GPLv3 in it.  And, arguably, they must not use
software under the GPLv2 either.

It's about time for a change for better, wouldn't you think?
In 95% of the desktop computers, you can't make changes to the OS that
runs on it.  Whom is this good for?

This makes it seem like you think that passing on the source code is
enough to comply with the GPL.  Check your assumptions.  It's not.

Time shifting of any shows, creating copies of shows for personal use,
letting others do so.  Think fair use, and how TiVO software and DRM
in general gets in the way.

For those who are not willing to abide by the spirit of the license,
yes.  Does it look like I'm concerned about them?  If they're willing
to look for and maybe even find holes in the license to disrespect
users' freedoms, why should I worry about the problems that plugging
these holes is going to cause them?  If they'd taken the spirit of the
GPL for what it is, instead of looking for loopholes, this improved
wording wouldn't be causing them any problems whatsoever.

This is a pretty sad accusation.  2/3s of the Free Software packages
use the GPL with its existing spirit, and you still haven't shown that
any changes proposed in GPLv3 fail to abide by the same spirit.  That
some (many?) people misunderstood or disregarded the spirit is an
unfortunate fact, but trying to pose the patching that's going into
GPLv3 as if it was a matter of personal taste, rather than improved
compliance with the spirit, is unfair and uncalled for.

What are you doing lurking and spreading confusion in a list about a
project that chose to use it, then?

Oh, sorry.  I missed when the meaning of the word computer was
narrowed from "machine with a general-purpose microprocessor, memory
and other peripherals" to whatever you decide it is.
And then, the GPL doesn't talk about computers at all.  It's not about
the hardware, it's about the software, remember? ;-)

At which point, you get punished by the law system.

Err..  The hardware licensor who includes software under the GPL be
supposed to be a licensee of the software in order to have legal
permission to distribute it, at which point the following provision
kicks in:
  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
  Program) [...] You may not impose any further restrictions on the
  recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. [...]
And here's one of the rights granted herein that would be restricted
by this hardware license:
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
  of it, thus forming a work based on the Program,
So such a restriction in the hardware license seems to be failure to
comply with the GPL, which means the violator may lose the license.

This sounds like a reasonable point.  Please bring it up at
gplv3.fsf.org.  If it requires specialized hardware to modify the
software in the device, the hardware manufacturer can't modify the
software without cooperation from the user, and then perhaps it would
be fair for the user to need cooperation from the manufacturer.

If you've already made your mind about this, in spite of not having
the facts, I guess it doesn't make sense for me to waste my time
trying to convince you, does it?

Since they got permission to distribute the software under the
condition of passing on the freedoms without imposing further
restrictions on their exercise.
