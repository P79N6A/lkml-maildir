It's three now (two of them deserved to merged) and re-ordered so the
first two are trivial and the complex bits are easily skipped if you
don't want them.  
Just looking for Davide's email address.  Found it :)  I'll follow up
this message with the patches.  I'm not going to CC everyone else again
- but I'll CC LKML so you can follow it there if you want.
