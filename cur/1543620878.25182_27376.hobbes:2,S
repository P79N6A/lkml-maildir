Are you sure this is correct?  include/asm/io.h seems to indicate that i/o 
addresses for PCI may not map correctly.  The sound card I am using is PCI, 
not ISA.
Documentation/DMA-mapping.txt says that virt_to_bus is completly depreciated 
and nothing should be using it.  Well, grepping the kernel source shows that 
quite a bit still uses it.
What it looks like, on first glance, is that virt_to_bus  was changed for pci 
devices to give this error message.  (Since that symbol goes nowhere.)  That 
effects a number of things, not just sound. (A whole bunch of cardbus drivers 
I would guess...)
When was this change made? It appears as if they missed a few bits.
Comment: 2.5.4 has been more than a bit rough.  Rarely do i see more than one 
patch needed just to get it to compile. Not trying to be bitchy about it. 
Just a wee bit frustrated...
