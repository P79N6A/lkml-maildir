Ha!  I made exactly this same suggestion (URL lost in the mists of 
time), except that I proposed changing the syscall entries for every 
system call, not just the driver-related ones.
Nobody seemed to think it would work very well.
It leaves a few loose ends.  For example, suppose a user thread is 
already in the middle of a system call and is about to start doing some 
I/O (maybe it's waiting for a timer to expire).
In the end, this doesn't seem to be very different from freezing all 
user threads.
