You *are* aware WTF lost+found is for, right? If fsck finds lost inodes it
means that fs is corrupted and the last thing you want to do here is to
extend a directory. lost+found is created by mkfs. Not by mkdir(2). Try to
create a directory with mkdir and look at the size. 12K are there not to
store '.' and '..' - they should be able to accomodate the links for lost
inodes. In situation when fs is damaged. Without touching bitmaps or
eating up new blocks.
Present scheme doesn't create lost+found. It is done by mkfs which has
perfectly valid reason to make it larger than 1 block.
