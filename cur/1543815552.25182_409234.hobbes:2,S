Howdy,
This has always been a bit of a fuzzy area to me since the 3M / Microtouch controllers support  calibration within the device.  (i.e.:  send raw output, or the devices internally calculated - calibrated - output.).  After asking this question long ago, I decided to document it and move on...  Is there a userland calibration mechanism for anything in the userspace besides something like QT Embedded?
Regards, 
Todd E. Johnson

well, all nice and good, but...it doesn't belong into the driver.
it would belong into the input subsystem or evdev. there are other
absolute devices not handled by this driver that need the same
calibration...
but i still think it should be in userspace...
still, it might be worth discussing it with the input hackers.
