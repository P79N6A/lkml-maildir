Thanks - I'll set as high as I can.

Yes. I have never had it fail two times in a row. Powering off and restarting has fixed it everytime 
so far.

I have not had this problem (yet?) with 2.6.15-rc7 or 2.6.15; however, it occurs so infrequently 
that I'm not sure I can rule out these later versions. The case I reported involved a dirty reiserfs 
file system. I had been debugging the bcm43xx driver and the system had frozen during shutdown 
because the module could not be unloaded. After I powered off for about 1 second, I restarted. The 
bug dump occurred fairly quickly and I believe it is early in the reboot sequence.
