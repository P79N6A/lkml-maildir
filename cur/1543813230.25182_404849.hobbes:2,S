Actually, that check is never triggered, for slightly subtle reason.

In the context of TRACEME, child == current.
Historically, there's been no default security check for TRACEME, so
a change here has some small chance of breaking things (which would
be fine for plugging a real security hole).  Parent less privileged
than child which did TRACEME is a bit of a contrived case, so security
implications aren't so worrisome.  Modules like SELinux will actually
check this case, and should properly restrict.  We can try a change in
-mm for a while.

This is not valid when !CONFIG_SECURITY.
