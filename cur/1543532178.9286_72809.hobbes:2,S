	Yeah, well...  Too bad devfsd doesn't cover everything listed in
devices.txt.  If you are going to remap the known universe, you shouldn't
be selective about what you are going to support and what you aren't.

	Ok...  Then tell me, how do I tell devfsd to map all devices that
come up ttf/{0-255} to /dev/ttyF{0-255} and cuf/{0-255} to /dev/cuf{0-255}
and ip2/ipl{0-3} to /dev/ip2ipl{0-3} and ip2/stat{0-3} to /dev/ip2stat{0-3}
for the Computone boards?  I haven't figured it out yet.  It's not in
devfsd, in spite of the fact that the ttyF{n}, cuf{n}, ip2ipl{n}, and
ip2stat{n} devices are listed in devices.txt.
	It would have been nice and would have made sense if there had
been some sort of perl-like regex for the config file.  Something
like "s/ttf\/\([0-9]*\)/ttyF\1/" where we could have configured it
on the fly for devices that were never put in there.  I don't see where
I can do something like that.  All I see in devfsd is a whole series of
special cases and string compares which could have been a general purpose
regex engine.
	I also don't see a thing in there for the USB devices.  I don't
see devfs creating anything for my usb printer when I plug it in, or the
usbmouse either, for that matter.  I've got 2.3.99pre3 and I've got
devfsd running.  If these things are supported, why isn't anything
happening?
	Patches for devfs support for the Computone boards were submitted
weeks ago, but they're not in the kernel sources yet and I doubt their
going to make 2.4.0.  How many other drivers have no support?  Somehow,
I suspect that most of the intelligent multiport boards fall into that
category and I don't see anything in the pcmcia stuff either.  I agree
that some things "fall out in the wash" when they register things like
standard tty ports and drives.  But that still leaves a lot out that
haven't been done yet.  Sure, I figured out that you aren't having any
problems with this because you aren't using any of these things.
	I also sent Richard (and the devfs list) a list of the ports
and devices that the Computone boards use that are not in devfsd.  Maybe
one day they'll show up in devfsd and maybe they won't.  I haven't
heard a peep back on that front.  I'm sure the patches will make it
into the kernel eventually, I'm just not sure when.  That's in the
hands of the man in charge.

	Read the docs.  Did the patches to the drivers and submitted same.
Even did the patches to the install scripts to recognize when devfs is
running and create the links instead of devices.  Even downloaded the
latest devfsd, which is why I know it's broken and not supporting
everything in devices.txt.

	Just broke was my experience.  But I guess I use a few toys that
you don't.
