I checnged from the sk98lin to the previous driver Adrian said was the 
"right one," skge IIRC. Then he started pushing sky2, and I tried that. 
Like you I get hangs, but unlike you the system doesn't hang, just the 
NIC. No errors, warnings, and reboot fixes it. Acts as if the cable were 
pulled.
That was with 2.6.22.5 (or so), dropped back to an old kernel with 
sk98lin, previously had uptimes in three digit days. Up for a week or so 
now.
Haven't tried later kernels, don't intend to, while no network is really 
secure, it not really useful.
