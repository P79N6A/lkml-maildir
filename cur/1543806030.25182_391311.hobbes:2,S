Well I think deliberate kernel bugs should at least be accompanied by
a big fat warning in the code, and an explanation of what is happening
and why.

So it is just a matter of time before someone actually hits this.
I went back through and tested and the actual symptoms are weird.
The thread calling exec just hangs forever, waiting for pid == 1 to
exit.  Anyway I found a simple fix so it is probably better to fix
it than to paper over the problem anyway.
Patch follows in a minute.
