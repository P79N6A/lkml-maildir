If that AMD is running a 32-bit kernel, the code already in the kernel
should work just fine (barring hardware issues like busticated HPET/timer
and so on).  If it doesn't work, we should debug that issue.
If you're running a 64-bit kernel, you might want to check here:

The 2.6.22-rc3-hrt2 patch series can be 'quilt'ed onto a -rc3-mmm1 tree
with about 20 minutes of work fixing a few trivial rejects (2 or 3 patches
already in -mm, and another 2 or 3 trivial rejectts...)
