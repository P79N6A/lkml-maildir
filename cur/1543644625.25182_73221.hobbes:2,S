Note: I will sign an NDA to get the specs for this card (family) but I
would much prefer that somebody gets a clue and just releases the spec.
Frankly, this board needs all the help it can get, based on comparative
performance.  Keeping the spec secret is just a brilliant way to ensure
it will die, and thus be worth $0.00 to the purchaser.
(I sincerely hope somebody in the DAC960 food chain notices this
comment, or somebody forwards it to one of the aforementioned: give
the world the spec and we will reciprocate by making the thing go as
fast as theoretically possible.)
