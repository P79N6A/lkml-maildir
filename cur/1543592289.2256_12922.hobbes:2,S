I set up a machine at work a few months ago with two Seagate 73GB
Ultra160 drives (model ST173404LW) using the Adaptec AIC-7899 adapter
on board a ServerWorks LE chipset based motherboard.  Everything has
been working fine using the stock RedHat 7.0 2.2.16-22smp kernel.  I
also played with some 2.4.1-ac kernels to try out ReiserFS, and also
had no problems using the disks.
