It's not just random guessing, the relationship between HZ and MIDI
clock is well known.  But it's not trivial to give hard numbers because
of the range of hardware possibilities.  Here's another linux-audio-dev

I guess there's a good argument that we should have stuck with the RTC
like in 2.4, but sleep() based timing is a much nicer interface, and it
did work in 2.6.0 - 2.6.12 so the MIDI people have grown used to it.
