I don't want to argue Pavel. I want to give users the best suspend to disk 
implementation they can get. If you want to argue, you can do so with 
yourself. Meanwhile, I'll work on getting Suspend2 ready for merging, and let 
Andrew and Linus decide what they think should happen. If they want to step 
in now and tell me not to bother, I'll happily listen and just maintain the 
patches out of kernel until you and Rafael get swsusp up to scratch. I'll 
even cc them now so they can have the opportunity to tell me not to bother. 
But that's not what I've heard so far. In previous correspondence between us, 
Andrew has seemed keen to get a better implementation in, and Linus said 
something to the effect of "I'm sold" when I gave him an impromptu demo last 
week at LCA (Linus, if you read this, feel free to tell me if my memory is 
faulty and I'm putting words in your mouth).
As to backwards compatability, that shouldn't be hard to do.

Nigel
