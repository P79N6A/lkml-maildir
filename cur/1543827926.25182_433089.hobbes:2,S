I was talking about turning off system-wise taskstats data preparation and
delivery when every task exits. Sometimes customers like to do some
benchmarking and need to turn off nonessential features.
Are you saying if there is no listener, data will not be assembled and sent
by the kernel? I thought kernel would always send no matter whether there
is listener? I apologize for the noise if i made a mistake.
