Following is happening.  The system boots, /dev/pts is a directory (I can
see it by logging on the serial console).  devpts is mounted on /dev/pts.
I log in by ssh.  It works.  /dev/pts/0 appears.  I log out.  /dev/pts
directory disappears!
I log in by ssh again.  I get this message on the console:
devfs_remove: no entry for pts!
ssh hangs.  I can recreate /dev/pts by mkdir, umount it and mount it
again.  Then ssh works again, but again only once.  /dev/pts disappears on
logout.
