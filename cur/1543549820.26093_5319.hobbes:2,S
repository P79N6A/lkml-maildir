	I am currently seeing the same behaviour. My machine is up for
	42 days now. Kernel 2.2.16-3 (RH 6.2). I am quite sure I could
	play CDROM a few weeks ago. But now, when I launch cdplay
	or xplaycd, no CD is detected :
/home/danis/DISCOGRAPHIE/JethroTull/Stormwatch/mp3 > cdplay
/dev/cdrom: Mauvais type de medium (wrong medium type)
/home/danis/DISCOGRAPHIE/JethroTull/Stormwatch/mp3 > dmesg
...
VFS: Disk change detected on device ide1(22,0)
cdrom: pid 15218 must open device O_NONBLOCK!
cdrom: open failed.
