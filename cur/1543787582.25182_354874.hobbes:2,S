I talked to one of the authors of these specs.  SDI is an attempt to
create an open standard for the somewhat proprietary CSMI spec developed
by HP.  It is currently languishing in t10 due to the IOCTL problem you
describe below (the "no new IOCTL's" doctrine caught them by surprise).
There is some thought to going to a write()/read() on a character device
model, but this has various problems as well.

That was one of the reasons the MPT Fusion and Adaptec drivers were
rejected.  There were others as well, such as lack of a SAS transport
class.
