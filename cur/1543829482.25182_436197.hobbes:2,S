"deliberately" is a bit exagerated here. Failed stack overflows,
hardware memory corruption and various bugs that happen to most
application developpers at early coding stage are not what can be
called "deliberate".
Also, I don't know if memory leak detectors rely on getting a SEGV,
but this patch would make them useless on apps which map addr 0.

I understand your point, but I think that covering most situations the
same way helps reducing exceptions, and helps troubleshooting.
