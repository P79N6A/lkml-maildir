Jon,
Trailing white space added by part2 and part3 annoys "git" (29
total places between the two parts).
Generic builds (based on arch/ia64/defconfig or arch/ia64/configs/gensparse_defconfig)
throws out 3 warnings, one each from arch/ia64/hp/zx1/hpzx1_machvec.c,
arch/ia64/hp/zx1/hpzx1_swiotlb_machvec.c and arch/ia64/sn/kernel/machvec.c
include/asm/machvec_init.h:32: warning: initialization from incompatible pointer type
The problems is "platform_dma_init" which can be defined as
"machvec_noop()" which returns "void", not "int" at required
by your change to the ia64_mv_dma_init type.
On the plus side it does boot on ia64 Intel Tiger ... but more of
the fancier bits of this code are used by the zx1 and zx1_swiotlb
versions which I didn't get time to test today.
