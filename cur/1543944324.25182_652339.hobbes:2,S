It depends ... if you actually have a use for the customisations, yes.
If you just want the basics of who (what's in the enclousure), what
(activity) and where (locate) then I think it solves your problem almost
entirely.
So, entirely as a straw horse, tell me what else your enclosures provide
that I haven't listed in the four points.  The SES standards too provide
a huge range of things that no-one ever seems to implement (temperature,
power, fan speeds etc).
I think the users of enclosures fall int these categories
85% just want to know where their device actually is (i.e. that sdc is
in enclosure slot 5)
50% like watching the activity lights
30% want to be able to have a visual locate function
20% want a visual failure indication (the other 80% rely on some OS
notification instead)
When you add up the overlapping needs, you get about 90% of people happy
with the basics that the enclosure services provide.  Could there be
more ... sure; should there be more ... I don't think so ... that's what
value add the user libraries can provide.
