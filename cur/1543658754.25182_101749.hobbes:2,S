   Those guys will have to bump mod refcount themselves then.
   sock_init_data() and sock_graft() have access to ->owner field but sk_alloc()
   doesn't. So we either have to change sk_alloc() API or make call to
   sock_init_data()/sock_graft() a must. Any other suggestions ?
This isn't rocket science, just make a new sock_foo() interface
that merely does the module owner setup.
