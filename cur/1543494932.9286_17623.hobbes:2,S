Argh. No. No, no, no, no.
The value of 'a=b' is the value of 'b' (which is also the value of 'a' after
the assignment). What do you mean, the "assignment was tested"?
You'd expect
 int a, b, c = 4;
 a = b = c;
 to work, just as well as a = ( b = c ), wouldn't you? It's *exactly* the
 same thing. There's nothing magical about an if/else construct.

No, it's true only if the value being assigned is true. This is the way K&R
C works, the way ANSI C works, and the way ANSI C++ works. Any other standard
which works any other way is defining a different language, not C.

The result _is_ tested. Show me any standard that thinks you're right. Or
any compiler for that matter.

Sequence points have sod all to do with this.
I do hope you don't write C code for anything critical. You don't seem
to be very familiar with the language.
Maybe you'd better stick to ADA. *sigh*
