Yes, apologies for taking so long with this.
I tried the acpi_skip_timer_override boot option last night,
after Tony pointed it out, and this also works around the
problem.
To summarize the cause is the changes made to early-quirks.c
in the mentioned commit and when this is reverted the problem
goes away.
There doesn't seem to be any sign of a living HPET on this
board or any way of enabling it in the current BIOS revision
but it seems on intermittent boots the check in early-quirks.c
returns, the timer override doesn't happen, and the kernel
fails to boot properly.
Btw, this is the Asus A8N-VM *CSM* main board, the non-CSM
variety actually has a nForce 410 rather than an
nForce 430 chip. I don't know whether they behave any
differently but the two boards actually have different BIOS
releases.
If reverting the commit would disable the HPET on boards
that do actually support it I personally don't mind using
the acpi_skip_timer_override workaround.
