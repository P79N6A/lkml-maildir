Or other subminor releases.  I never said that needed changes at major
release boundaries were unreasonable (in this case, I was informed
that the change was 2.2.0->2.2.1.  It appears the report I got was
erroneous).  Steven, please read the original arguments before getting
so far off track (And note that Alan gave a definitive answer to those
arguments that I was satisfied with, assuming kernel/dist developers
could pull it off in reality).  And despite Derek generally agreeing
with me, he applied my argument far beyond what I intended to address.

Not SCSI specifically, but kernel interfaces in general.
My original argument used SCSI SG as an (immediate) example.  It was
in no way specific only to SCSI and now the argument has nothing to do
with SCSI.  We should stop Cc:ing the SCSI/cdwrite lists.
