Yikes! I do apologise. I have been a little bit busy lately and that my
old PC decided to fail on the 24th December so I've been using that as
an excuse for panic buying, building and installing a 64-bit system but
I do have an updated patch available that is scalable (in that... if
new compression formats are used in the future they can be easily added
by adding text to init/Kconfig and code to Makefile.modinst).
I have noticed the patch from Jan for specifying settings for gzip. I
don't see why something like this can't be added to init/Kconfig...
config MODULE_COMPRESS_OPTIONS
	string "Compression method command line options"
	depends on MODULES
	help
	  This option specifies the command line options to be used for
	  the selected compression method.
	  Please refer to the selected compression method's documentation 
	  on which options should be used.
	  If unsure, leave this option blank.
And perhaps alter for Makefile.modinst (after applying the patch below)...
quiet_cmd_modules_compress_gzip = COMPRESS $@
      cmd_modules_compress_gzip = gzip $(CONFIG_MODULE_COMPRESS_OPTIONS) \
				 -c $(2)/`basename $@` \ 
				 > $(2)/`basename $@`.gz; \
				rm $(2)/`basename $@`
I'll supply the patch for what's been done so far (that and it's gone
3am here...) so the above makes a bit more sense. I should point out
that in the patch there should be an additional blank line after
endchoice for init/Kconfig but adding that blank line with the plus
sign seems to cause the patching process to fail so I had to take it
out and that this patch works with 2.6.27.4 (which is the kernel I am
currently using) with a slight fuzz and I haven't chance to test it
with the latest kernel.
I'll have a go at incorporating what I've said regarding
MODULE_COMPRESS_OPTIONS into another patch using the latest kernel (and
add the standard 'If unsure' message to MODULE_COMPRESS as well).
