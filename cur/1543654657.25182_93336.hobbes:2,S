[PATCH] Patch/resubmit(2.5.50): Eliminate pci_dev.driver_data
	To review, this patch deletes pci_dev.driver_data, using the
existing pci_dev.device.driver_data field instead, thereby shrinking
struct pci_dev by four bytes on 32-bit machines.  The few device
drivers that attempted to directly reference pci_dev.driver_data were
fixed in a patch of mine that Jeff Garzik got into 2.5.45.  Also,
making this change should help with memory allocation improvements in
the future, although that's a separate issue.
