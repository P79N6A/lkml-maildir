In fact this is almost what OpenVZ does for half a year, both containers 
and VPIDs.
But it is very usefull to see process tree from host system. To be able 
to use std tools to manage containers from host (i.e. ps, kill, top, 
etc.). So it is much more convinient to have 2 pids. One globally 
unique, and one for container.
