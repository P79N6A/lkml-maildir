Well, I tried changing the order of driver loading in driver/scsi/hosts.c
after reading something on the web but that didn't work.
Then I tried what you (and another kind soul) suggested, i.e. mount by
label, and the machine fails to mount the / filesystem read-write on boot,
though I can do it manually. This is a Debian potato system. Well, I'm
tired and I've had too much wine and whisky so I am going to bed, but I
will attack this afresh tomorrow night...
Thanks for the advice, perhaps I'll need more tomorrow :)
