Hello,
  I have some good new and some bad news about 2.5.70-mm3.
The good news:
  The reiserfs changes seem to be stable, I have been running this
kernel on an all reiserfs box since this morning and everything seems
completely fine with it.
The bad news:
  Somewhere in the changes brought in from Linus BK (I assume since
there were USB changes there, but none that I noticed in your changes),
all my USB keyboard LEDs stopped working.  Numlock and capslock still
seem to function correctly but the LEDs on the keyboard no longer work,
with 2.5.70-mm2 they worked on VTs and in X, with 2.5.70-mm3 they don't
work on either.
