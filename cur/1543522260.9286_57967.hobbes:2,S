Data point.  2.2.12 with minimal services, a few getty, minilog, kswapd
and friends.  No squid, mail, httpd, named, X etc.

AFAICT, doing stat on any inode will use up inodes.  But only the first
time you stat a node, do it again and there is no effect.  This occurs
on at least ext2 and vfat filesystems but the symptom does not occur
doing stat() on /proc.
