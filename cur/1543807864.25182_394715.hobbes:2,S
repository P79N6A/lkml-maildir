You "cache"   task_struct->container->hotsubsys   under task_struct->hotsubsys.
We don't change containers other then at clone time, so no coherency issue here !!!!
Which subsystems pointers to "cache", should be agreed by the experts,
but first approach should always not to cache and go through the container.

Like that approach .. flexible .. particular when one has well specified namespaces.

Where does that approach end .. what's wrong with doing it at clone() time ?
Mainly the naming issue. Just providing a flag does not give me name.

Agreed.

In containers I simply created an explicite name, which ofcourse colides with the
clone() approach ..
One possibility is to allow associating a name with a namespace.
For instance
int set_namespace_name( long flags, const char *name ) /* the once we are using in clone */
{
	if (!flag)
		set name of container associated with current.
	if (flag())
		set the name if only one container is associated with the namespace(s)
		identified .. or some similar rule
}

Good question... at least with PID and FS two are there ..

Possible to split the lock up now.. one for each pidspace ?

Speaking of pids only here ...
Does it matter, you just hang all those containers hang of init.
What ever hierarchy they form is external ...
