That's usual in the embedded world - it's a way that embedded folk seem
to write their bug reports to provoke a "response"  (the content of the
response doesn't seem to matter, just as long as there is one.)
However, one also has to wonder - "2.6.13 kernel with arm support patches"
"arch/i386/kernel/semaphore.c".  Why have "arm" patches been applied (and
what were they) and why i386 is being built.
