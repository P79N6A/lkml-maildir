So would you like to leave it as Maintained or change it to
"Odd Fixes"?  (Maintained => a maintainer)  From the MAINTAINTERS file:
	Supported:	Someone is actually paid to look after this.
	Maintained:	Someone actually looks after it.
	Odd Fixes:	It has a maintainer but they don't have time to do
			much other than throw the odd patch in. See below..
	Orphan:		No current maintainer [but maybe you could take the
			role as you write your new code].
	Obsolete:	Old code. Something tagged obsolete generally means
			it has been replaced by a better system and you
			should be using that.
