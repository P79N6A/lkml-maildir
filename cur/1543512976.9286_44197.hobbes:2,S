cp -rl linux linux-foo; cd linux-foo; rm -rf include/asm; make distclean
and there you go. Links are there for purpose. Moreover, I normally just
do cp -rl before everything else and build on a mirror tree. Vi knows
how to deal with links, so it doesn't create a separate copy when you edit
file. Even if you are using the abortion from MIT the first variant will
go.
