 	Hello All ,  Does anoyone know howto identify a cause for these(*) ?
 	Or of any tools to help in the identification of the cause ?
 	So far the Machine checks only happen when I am running bonnie++ against
 	my software raid6 array .
 	I have done everything I know to do to attempt to ascertain what is
 	causing the machine checks .
 	ie:
  1)	memtest86+ for days ,  no errors .
  2)	cpuburnP6 ,  The tests run were 'cpuburnP6 E' & 'cpuburnP6 H' for ~
 	60 minutes each .  All CPU's & HT were at 96+<->100% for 60+ Minutes ,
 	no excessive heating or lockups . In single user mode of course .
 	I know cpuburn is old but it can excersize the comms between l1 & cpu
 	& l1 & l2 -> cpu if done right .
(*)
