The problem is that alsa is not stable. At least not like oss.
I switched from alsa to oss because i could compile oss
directly in my kernel
 (that was a long time ago).
and when 2.6.0-test apeared i compiled alsa in the kernel but i
had
problems with it and came back to oss:
1. SOund was jerky compared to oss (almost inaudible)
with oss emulation.
2. doesn't have an btaudio driver and i wasn't been able to
compile alsa and oss btaudio driver in the same kernel 
so i couldn't watch tv with the alsa kernel :-(
3. Many old sound applications require oss (even emulated)
And oss emulation is far from stable. 
These are my opinions. I hope they will change soon :-)
