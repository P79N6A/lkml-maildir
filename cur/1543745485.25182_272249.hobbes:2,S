When I wanted to send them, I didn't find them, and after that I forgot 
them...
if you are still interested for the irport, I could try to ask someone 
to send it to me.

Yes, it was just because it produce some warning message.

PnP is easy to understand ;)
When you probe a device, it will activate a device with the best 
configuration available.
When removing a device it will disable the resource of the device.
A driver could play a little with the resources configuration : try 
another configuration, but it is not really need.
Also PnP can provide several id for a device : for example for my smsc 
device, I have SMCf010 and PNP0510 or PNP0511. So in this case we should 
load the smsc driver first, otherwise for example a pnp version of 
irport could register the device and it is not available for smsc (PnP 
will see that there is a driver attached, and not give it to the smsc 
probe).
