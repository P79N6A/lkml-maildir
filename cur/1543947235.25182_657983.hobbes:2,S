The last patch does change the ptrace API - before it becomes public.
After it becomes public, ds.c can be changed without affecting the
ptrace API.
The last changes are not strictly necessary - I could as well implement
the old interface. If there are objections to or concerns regarding
those API changes, I will do just that. The changes are:
- add PTRACE_BTS_O_ALLOC to explicitly request reallocation of the BTS
buffer.
  This used to be implicit when the size changes.
- remove PTRACE_BTS_O_CUT_SIZE
  This used to reduce the size requested for the BTS buffer to the
maximal available size, if necessary.
  I do not think this is necessary. Users should check their ulimits.
This is what I meant with ironing out the ptrace API.
thanks and regards,
markus.
