Although turning off apm works, this is a fix to the symptom and not a
cure.  Has someone already taken a look at this code? Since
apm_bios_call_simple calls local_save_flags and afterwards
raw_lock_irq_restore is then called.  Shouldn't that have been
raw_local_save_flags?
That apm_bios_call_simple_asm also looks pretty scary!  I haven't yet
figured out how APM_FUNC_VERSION becomes a normal function.
