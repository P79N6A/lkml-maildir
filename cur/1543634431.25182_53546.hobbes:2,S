One question --- just how stable will this be if we boot into a kernel
that doesn't have the coalescing enabled, and start modifying
directories?  We _could_ just teach the current code to clear those
top 8 bits in the parent any time we touch a leaf node, but that's
unnecessarily expensive, so we'd really need to have some way of
either recreating the hint fields from scratch every so often, or of
spotting when they have become badly out-of-date.
Cheers,
 Stephen
