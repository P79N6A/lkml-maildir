So instead of kvetching, why don't you 
(a) Create your own stable series by snapshotting some 2.6.x tree
every six months, and then maintain a set of bug-fix only patches
against that 2.6.x tree?  Then convince the security people to port to
that particular 2.6.x-jrm tree?
(b) Convince the security folks to try to get their patches into the
mm- tree, for eventual inclusion into 2.6.
(c) Some combination of the two.
Either would probably be more likely to fulfill your needs than just
whining about it.
