Hi, Con,

I'm having a look at it now (better late than never...), and a couple of
questions come to mind...
The more general of the two is: would it make sense to somehow merge
your swapped_entry data structure with Rik's page-remembering scheme for
CLOCK-PRO?  Assumed that both are someday destined for inclusion, it
seems it would make sense to add just one "remember info about swapped
pages" data structure, rather than two.
Second question:

It looks like you are adding these fields to every address_space
structure in the system - and there can be a fair number of those.  But
further down, when it comes time to remember a swapped page:

You're only actually remembering pages associated with a single address
space.  
Do you anticipate adding prefetching from other address spaces as well?
If not, it might be worth putting these structures somewhere else to
avoid bloating the address_space structure.
...or am I missing something again...?
Thanks,
jon
