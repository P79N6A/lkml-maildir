Hi!
mc works nicely in 2.2.16 but not with 2.2.4-test5-pre4 (not tested on previous
tesx kernels)
The cursor go to the next line and nothing happens.
With 'ps', I can see that :
248   1 S    0:00 mc
249  ?  S    0:00 cons.saver /dev/tty1
250  p1 S    0:00 bash -rcfile .bashrc
I've nothing in the syslog.
The version of mc is 4.5.40
If I kill the process, the other ones (cons.saver /dev/tty1, 
bash -rcfile .bashrc) still run.
Any idea ?
