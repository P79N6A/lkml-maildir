The current keyboard code is far more powerful than you seem to think.
Keymaps are allocated dynamically, and only few people use more than 16.
You can have 256 keymaps, but they are not necessarily the 2^8 maps
belonging to all 2^8 combinations of simultaneously pressed modifier keys.
You can assign the "modifier" property to any key you like.
You can assign the effect of each modifier key as you like.
There are modifier keys with action while pressed, and modifier keys
that act on the next non-modifier keystroke (say, for handicapped),
and modifier keys that lock a state (say, to switch between Latin
and Cyrillic keyboards).
It seems very unlikely that you cannot handle Czech with all
combinations of 8 keys pressed, and need 9.
Please document carefully what you want to do and why you want
to do it. I think most reasonable things are possible.
(The weakest part is the support for Unicode / UTF8 - don't know
whether improvement would be good - it is clear that one doesnt
want to have full Unicode support in the kernel, but there is
continued pressure to add some support for diacriticals. We might.)
