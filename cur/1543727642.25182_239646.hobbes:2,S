fbdev only has one distribution vector - the kernel, DRM has multiple
distribution vectors, kernel, DRI snapshots, X releases, they all contain
their own DRM modules, also people with older kernels should be able to
use new drivers with little hassle, if we force people to upgrade their
kernel we are restricting what we allow them to do now ...
If we do go for a library split, we should use the kernel config system
like I mentioned and fight any attempts to change it, to re-iterate, if
you build drm into the kernel you have to build the graphics drivers in as
well, (we can use a symbol to enforce it), if you build the drm as a
module all drivers have to be modular, and the DRM makefile installs the
core DRM, we could also create a drm_ver.h file that gets
generateed at compile time automatically and then included into
both drm core and module at build time, if this differs just refuse to
load and stick a FAQ up telling the user they are messing something up ..

Like Keith I don't buy this argument too much either, I think we should be
able to continue as much as possible with what people can do now ..
especially snapshot type systems..
