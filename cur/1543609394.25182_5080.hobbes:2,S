Hello Keith,
It's been a LONG time since I've heard from you.  I hope
all is well.

mv .config ..
make mrproper
mv ../.config .
make oldconfig
make dep clean bzImage modules
install, boot

I did start off with a clean config though I didn't do
a "mrproper".  I re-tested on the MD7.0 box and
"mrproper" solved my issue.  I haven't had to do this
step since the old 2.0.2x days and I feel somewhat
embarrassed by this.
Thanks again for setting me strait though. I am
curious for an explanation from the powers at be to
why this hit me now though I've been compiling kernels
without "mrproper" for years.  Am I just lucky?  ;-)
