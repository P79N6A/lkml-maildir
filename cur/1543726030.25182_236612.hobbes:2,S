Oh, mmm, well, for some unexplainable reason it did apply the patches 
on top of rc2 without any fussing, and it is building, ahh scuse me, 
is built.  This athlon 2800 is awesome, my makeit script runs in a 
bit over 6 minutes.  And unrelated of course, by now, the kde build 
has puked all over itself, it now doesn't like the glibc installed by 
FC2.  Go figure...
Anyway, now I'll go make it again using the 2.6.8-rc1 main patch & 
throw this one away.  Not that big a deal when there a 120Gb drive to 
play in.
