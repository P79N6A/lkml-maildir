That's because it's not an attachment but inserted into the mail and your 
mailer is mangling it on extraction. Save the whole email unmodified (eg with 
a "save as" function) and use that as the patch. Don't fret as it's a 
non-critical fix since it's a corner case only and it will be in the next -ck 
anyway.
