This update brings an urgent fix for #if handling, and a couple of new checks.
Of note:
 - fixes spurious warning on mismatched #if/#else within the context
 - fixes to type/cast warnings on bad spacing
 - seq_operations should be const
The first patch in this series is the fix for the spurious warnings which
were affecting Ingo and probabally should be expedited to mainline.
Complete changelog below.
