Hmm -- does not this open DoS attack? What about users taking poll at
_many_ directories and eating nonswappable ram this way? You seem to
need to remember what last poll did, so something like
poll("/usr")
poll("/usr/src")
poll("/usr/X11")
... here kernel needs to remember what I polled and when, because I c
an do
poll("/usr")
again. This seems to me like pretty trivial attach.
I really wonder what right interface is...
