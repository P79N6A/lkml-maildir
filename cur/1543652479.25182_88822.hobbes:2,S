This patch adds a new permission managing file system. Furthermore, it
adds two modules, which make use of this file system.
One module allows granting capabilities based on user-/groupid. The
second module allows to grant access to lower numbered ports based on
user-/groupid, too.
Changes:
- moved locking from spinlock to semaphore
