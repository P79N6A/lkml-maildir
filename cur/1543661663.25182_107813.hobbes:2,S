Depends what your after. There is a nice kernel poster sold by Think
Geek that uses a script (IIRC) written by Rusty Russel of the 2.4.0
kernel layout. Basically a glorified call tree diagram. I think the
image public so you should be able to download it somewhere.
Are you interested in any particular bit or just a general overview.
There are a number of books available that offer commentry on how it all
goes together which are worth looking at.
