It means "select lower 32 bits, because the other 32 bits are 
elsewhere."  Since its an arg to cpu_to_le32() I suppose there is an 
implicit truncation in there, but I add such masking myself to my own 
code.  Makes it more clear to the reader what's going on, IMO.
Its not quite what DMA_32BIT_MASK intends, either, IMO.
