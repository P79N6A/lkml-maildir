That combination certainly doesn't make sense.  No VisWS or NUMAQ systems
have ACPI.  How did you manage to turn this on given:
menu "ACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface) Support"
        depends on !X86_VISWS
        depends on !IA64_HP_SIM
        depends on IA64 || X86
If you apply the following patch, does it help?

"Next the statesmen will invent cheap lies, putting the blame upon 
the nation that is attacked, and every man will be glad of those
conscience-soothing falsities, and will diligently study them, and refuse
to examine any refutations of them; and thus he will by and by convince 
himself that the war is just, and will thank God for the better sleep 
he enjoys after this process of grotesque self-deception." -- Mark Twain
