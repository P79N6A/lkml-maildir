Perhaps a kernel space daemon but with some ioctls that userspace can 
manipulate?
Or can the whole daemon be offloaded to userspace? Having some driver ioctls 
and a sysfs interface would allow the KDE and GNOME people to read the sysfs 
info and parse accordingly for some nifty tools.
Sounds good?
Shawn.
