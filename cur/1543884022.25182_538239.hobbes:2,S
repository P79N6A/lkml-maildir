It's horrid. I'd much rather see
        if (veryverylengthycondition1 &&
            smallcond2 &&
            (conditionnumber3a || condition3b)) {
                ...
        }
Even if that does take it over 80 columns, the 'failure' mode will be
that it gets wrapped round to the beginning of the screen or truncated
at 80 columns -- and for the _majority_ of the time, it doesn't matter.
Unless you're paying particular attention to the logic and debugging the
statement, a 'high-level' view of what's going on is perfectly
sufficient; you don't actually read every character anyway.
