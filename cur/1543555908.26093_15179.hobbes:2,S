This (or similar) has the added advantage of making it obvious that this  
is documentation, and not a superfluous initialization.
Sure, if you (generic you) look at your own code, you may know what it  
means if it's written a certain way. But if you look at other's code, or  
others look at your code, that is not clear. It is clear with a comment.
