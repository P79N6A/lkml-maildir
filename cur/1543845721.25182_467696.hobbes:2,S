This may be paranoia, but:
If I'm reading the code right (I may well not be), you seem to be 
evaulating _GTF before _SDD. The spec (9.9.1.1) claims that _SDD should 
be evaulated before _GTF - we had a couple of bug reports against an 
earlier version of the patch that may have been due to that, but I never 
had a chance to chase them down properly.
