OK, number seven on the list was going to be thinking about tracking
timeouts at the block layer.
Tag starvation handling is a property of each individual SCSI HBA (and I
know it shouldn't be).  Some do a good job, some don't.  However, it's
implicitly also handled in the SCSI error handler because on timeout we
quiesce the device (which finally causes the starved tag to execute).  I
have thought about doing it properly in the error handler, but it's a
radical divergence---you basically need to begin to throttle the queue,
but wait to see if your starved tag gets serviced and then increase the
feed again (as opposed to our current quiesce then handle model).

Tag starvation isn't really a problem for the majority of modern SCSI
drives (big iron vendors yelled and kicked about this a while ago).  You
can still find some of the older drives that do have these issues (I
keep several for the purposes of exciting the error handling).

Most scsi discs have a non linear geometry anyway, so "head scheduling"
is pretty useless to them.  All SCSI really wants is I/O consolidation. 
i.e. we'd like to use fewer larger sized requests.
