Yes, that seems to have fixed the problem. So far, I see a definite
improvement over the vanilla 2.6.0-test1. 
But Ingo's patch made the vanilla 2.6.0-test1 awesome under really
heavy load. I basically was compiling 2.6.0-test1-mm2-O8 from scratch
and the system was (almost) as responsive as if there was no load, with
no audio skipping. That was the first real improvement I have seen
over the vanilla 2.4.21... Will keep you'll posted at how
2.6.0-test1-mm2-O8int compares..
