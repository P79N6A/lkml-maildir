Please chuck out:
add-new-string-functions-strict_strto-and-convert-kernel-params-to-use-them.patch
(along with Randy's perfectly reasonable -fix.patch).
So predictable that it would just disable loading modules with params:
Feb  4 13:17:02 blonde kernel: thinkpad_acpi: `1' invalid for parameter `experimental'
Maybe it's something as simple as a trailing whitespace issue,
I haven't looked, would prefer the originator to do so.
openSUSE 10.3 if that makes any difference.
