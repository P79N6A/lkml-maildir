    Hi Anders :)

    Well, not exactly. Let's say that wget seems more 'aggresive',
but really the one who gets all the speed is the *first* downloading
program started, although some of them seems to be more friendly than
others. Wget is a corner case. Lukemftp is less aggresive.
    I've already considered the tcp windows issue, but is not the
case (IMHO). I think that's more probable the option regarding ISP
large queues.
    Thanks for your answer and interest :))
