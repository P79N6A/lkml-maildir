Well, for things that seek, the behaviour will be the same as it was
before: it will always mark the page accessed, because "file->f_reada"
will always be zero for the first read after a lseek.
That's why we have the "or if we just did a seek to it". You cannot _just_
test for "did we read the beginning of a page", because that fails for
seekers, whether database or otherwise.
