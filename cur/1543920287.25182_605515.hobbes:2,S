FWIW, forcedeth has this funky disable_irq()-based locking mechanism 
that is currently the subject of some kernel.org bugzillas.  I would 
also check and make sure that isn't perturbing your results (even though 
it seems unrelated, based on what I read here).  That might include 
disabling MSI if it's enabled, and/or turning on spinlock debugging.
