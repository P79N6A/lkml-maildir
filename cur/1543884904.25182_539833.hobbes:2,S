The hardware (PPC405EZ) actually implements an high speed, dma capable, ADC 
controller with 10-bit resolution and up to 4MHz sample rate. The current 
driver doesn't support all these features though (dma is not supported right 
now for example). Could be that this will be added in future releases. It 
would be good though, to have the driver located at the "correct" place in 
the kernel tree right away.
