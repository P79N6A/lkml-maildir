Agree. That's EXACTLY why vfat is broken by design.

Unfortunatelly it's NOT hardlink. If I have file with two names on normal
fs (ext2) i can delete ANY at MY will. It's NOT hardlink.

You suggested three schemes already. All of them are with HUGE holes. If
you can sit down and write some scheme WITHOUT HOLES then we'll have
something to talk about. And no, testing broken 10000 schemes from your is
not an option.

I'm really sorry but you said right thing above: FILE is marked IMMUTABLE.
NOT it's name. If you mark FILE immutable via hardlink you'll see that
it's immutable for other name as well.

Since Anti....  can not be attached to ANTIDI~.LST anymore.

So far you proposed three cures for disaster. Each one is MUCH worser then
distater itself. Next time please cook up something less ugly...
