If you're chasing micro-optimisations, you could write
    /* if irq_status is not 0 or ~0, do <blah> */
    if (((unsigned)irq_status + 1) >= 2)
which should reduce the number of conditional branches
to a single one. (And drop the cast if irq_status is
declared as unsigned.)
But for long-term maintenance just spelling out the exact
condition (irq_status != 0 && irq_status != ~0) is preferable.
