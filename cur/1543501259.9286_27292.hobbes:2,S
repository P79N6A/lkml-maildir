I guess this message was too short to explain my point of view.

I think it pointless looking only at the voices of real users on *this*
forum. They aren't exactly the broad cross section from moron to genius that
use computers. They are mostly people who value flexibility above most other
things. I certainly value the flexibility they refer to, but its not the
whole picture.

Extremely familiar. I'm no theoretician in this. I think theory has no place
in this particular argument. This is one place where a practical balance
between flexibility and discipline is needed. I used a NeXT for a couple of
years and loved it. In fact its the only system that ever made me feel a
clean guiding hand had designed it. It wasn't perfect, though. It had some
messy compromises.
Sure some of the NeXT tools dealt with the special qualities of the bundle
directories, but not all. This is fine when you are working with documents on
your own machine, you are a knowledgeable user, and you can keep some
control. Now look at the co-operative case. I worked on documents; I sent
them to other people to be worked on; I got them back to do further work;
etc. I often found more and more crud building up in these documents, as
people made uncontrolled changes. That was the weakness. The ordinary users
had no idea what these directories were about. Sometimes they saw a document.
Sometimes they saw a directory. When they saw a directory they copied stuff
to it. The tools applied restrictions in a confusing and haphazard manner. In
fact I saw a bundle directory within a bundle directory at one time, and the
GUI got rather confused.
The strength, of course, is the usual Unix one. Don't enforce anything you
don't have to do for basic security and you won't limit anyone's flexibility.
I would only advocate some lightweight control on the special directories, to
try to limit pleb users abilities to make a mess of things and to limit more
knowledgeable people from making accidental changes. From experience I don't
think NeXT got that balance quite right. They chose to avoid making any
changing to Mach, and creating any NFS compatibility problems. For a small
time player just starting up that may have been the right choice.

Strange. When I type "ls -al" I can see all these "r"s and "w"s. I wonder
what they are for? They can't be to stop me doing something stupid. I'm told
that just isn't the Unix way. Get real. Unix has a number of ways in which it
tries to stop you doing something stupid. What it doesn't do is *prevent* you
doing something when you know what you are doing.
I wouldn't advocate inhibiting anything, only restricting against the
uncontrolled use of certain possibilities. I'm one of those people who hates
finding the system won't let me do something that makes sense, so I would
never advocate a solution that bans certain behaviour. I am in favour of a
solution that protects people from their own stupidity (and yes, we all do
dumb things when we are sleepy, even if we don't when wide awake).
Because I'm not advocating a total ban I am not advocating a kernel solution.
I think an additional directory entry flag to differentiate an ordinary
directory from a bundle directory makes a lot of sense, though. This would be
a solid hook on the nature of the directory, while a file extension
convention is a bit vague - you could upset a NeXT by creating an ordinary
directory with a name ending in .rtfd. Such a flag could be turned on and
off, like a write flag, allowing the directory to become an ordinary one at
any time for uncontrolled access to its contents. That seems to me very much
in keeping with the style of Linux/Unix.
Of course there are compatibility issues involved in this, and like NeXT I
expect the final solution will be a fully compatible fudge.
