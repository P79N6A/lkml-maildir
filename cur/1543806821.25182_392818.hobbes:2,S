This is an interesting approach.  Could you elaborate a bit on on why
you need the two different approaches?  What conditions cause the switch
to the sparse approach?
Also, if you could separate those two approaches out into two different
patches, it would be much easier to get a grasp about what's going on.
One of them is just an optimization, right?
Did you happen to catch Linus's mail about his preferred approach?
