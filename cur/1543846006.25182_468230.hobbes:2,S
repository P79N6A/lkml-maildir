My first guess was "lcd" ("d" as display), but there were already
devices with such name. So I chose "display", as they are additional
small displays (LCD or not). However, people thought it was a very
common name. Then I chose "LCD Display". Such name is more expressive
(it is "a Display, LCD type") and doesn't makes trouble with new lcd
screens, or the "lcd" drivers, or...
I don't care really about the name with or without "double d". Can
someone else give his/her opinion about this?
Thank you,
