Yep, it's working.

Maybe I should explain what is my disc layout...
Volume2 is one partition, and Volume6 is mounted as one of its directories, 
something like:
D:\  <- Volume2
D:\download <- Volume6
Volume6 works fine without using software raid though.  Volume2 does not.

I've tried the following:
# mdadm --build /dev/md1 -l linear -n 2 /dev/sda1 /dev/sda3
mdadm: array /dev/md1 built and started.
# mount /dev/md1 /mnt/d
# ls /mnt/d
ls: reading directory /mnt/d: Input/output error
dmesg output:
NTFS volume version 3.1.
NTFS-fs error (device md1): ntfs_readdir(): Actual VCN (0x6e68dc76fa7923) of 
index buffer is different from expected VCN (0x4). Directory inode 0x5 is 
corrupt or driver bug.
