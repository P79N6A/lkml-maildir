Subject: "NETDEV WATCHDOG eth0 transmit timeout" fun with ne2k-pci

In browsing this group's archives, I've found tons of people having
problems with their ethernet seemingly going dead and their
/var/log/messages filled with "kernel: NETDEV WATCHDOG: eth0: transmit
timed out" over and over and over again...
I'm having that problem running a Winbond 89c940 (which I could swear is
on a Linksys card) using the ne2k-pci drivers on the 2.4.7-10 that ships
with RH7.2...
Any hope in an easy resolution to this?
Thanks!
