Yeah, so merging the two patches ends up like this:

And yes...
This is still without a "failsafe" since I don't have an upper limit,
but it occurred to me that maybe it isn't that easy after all...
 - I can't trust the videocard memory probe...,
 - to just calculate the video_size * 3 (for tripple buffering) is bad ;-)
 - videocards with everyhing between 256k and 256 MB of memory,
   makes choosing the limit somewhat impossible...
 - of course there is also endless range of installed system memory...
So, any thoughts...?
Or should one just leave it open due to:
" it's your system, feel free to break it..." ;-)
Oh well,
I'm building my testkernel now with the above patch, 
and will be testing different vram options to "kill" my system...
