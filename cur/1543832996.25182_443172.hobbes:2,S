Hmm...doesn't look very safe does it.
There's no real need for us to skb_clone within the sem. Keeping a count of
listeners and doing the clone outside should let us avoid this problem.
I was trying to avoid doing the above because of the potential for
listeners getting added continuously to the list
(and having to repeat the allocation loop outside the down_write).
But on second thoughts, we're under no obligation to send the data to all the
listeners who add themselves in the short time between our taking a snapshot
of the listener count and when the send is done (within the down_write). So
it should be ok.

Thats true. The GFP_KERNEL allocation potentially called in netlink_trim() as part
of the genlmsg/netlink_unicast() is again a problem.
So perhaps we should switch to using RCU for protecting the listener list.
