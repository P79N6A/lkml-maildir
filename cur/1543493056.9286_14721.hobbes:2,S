From memory, Roxen Spinner was written in uLPC (micro-LPC, that's right, the
same LPC as in MudOS/Amylaar/LP-muds).  (I'm hoping my memory is right here,
we used to use Spinner here as our web server to do things the other web 
servers of the time couldn't do - it was very cool, and I think it was from
Roxen.)
Roxen Challenger is written in Pike, which they say "somewhat resembles C
and Java, but is not quite like either of those languages".  I haven't looked
at it to see what it is, maybe just further developed from uLPC.
Both Pike and the basic Roxen Challenger are under GPL.
I wouldn't be surprised if Challenger has really good benchmarks, given how 
good Spinner was for its time :-)
David.
