Just tried to boot 2.3.33. Unfortunately enough, the gdth driver does not
work for me. I have the root fs on a scsi disk plugged into the GDT6117RP
controller so I can't use that kernel at all.
The beast did actually boot for the first time and oopsed when I did try to
"cat /proc/scsi/gdth/0". Mea culpa, I did not copy the oops from the screen
by hand thinking that I'd better point my syslog to another machine to get
the oops logged. Unfortunatelly, it didn't work - kernel now oopses when
initializing the adapter outta initrd, oops goes off screen and console is
locked so no scrollback available... That's why I can't give an oops
trace...
Kernel is built fully modular (all scsi layer is modular, ide too) with
gcc-2.95.2. The use of kgcc-2.7.2.3 does not cure the problem. The system is
double Xeon/550 with 256 Mbyte RAM. Sure, kernel is built SMP. 64 Gbyte RAM
support is turned on.
I'm ready to make any test required to get the gdth driver fixed. Any ideas?
