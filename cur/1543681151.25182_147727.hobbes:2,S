I consider the send side complete covered already.  We don't
touch any of the data portion, we only put together the
headers.

There are cards, both existing and in development, that have
very simple header parsing engines you can program to do stuff
like this, it isn't hard at all.
But this is only half of the problem, you need a flow cache and
clever RX buffer management as well to make the RX side zero-copy
stuff work.
