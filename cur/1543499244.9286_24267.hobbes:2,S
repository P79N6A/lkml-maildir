Hi !
Sorry for the long delay ... 
again: my problem is the autoload behaviour of ppa.o

Here we go ...
ThS_home:[~]# lsmod 
Module                  Size  Used by
ThS_home:[~]# mount /dev/sda4 /mnt
ThS_home:[~]# df /mnt 
Filesystem         1024-blocks  Used Available Capacity Mounted on
/dev/sda4              98078   89536     8542     91%   /mnt
ThS_home:[~]# lsmod
Module                  Size  Used by
ppa                     8996   1  (autoclean)
ThS_home:[~]# umount /mnt
ThS_home:[~]# rmmod ppa
ThS_home:[~]# lsmod
Module                  Size  Used by
ThS_home:[~]# mount /dev/sda4 /mnt
mount: /dev/sda4 is not a valid block device
ThS_home:[~]# lsmod
Module                  Size  Used by
ThS_home:[~]# modprobe -V
modprobe version 2.2.2-pre6
modprobe: Nothing to load ???
Specify at least a module or a wildcard like \*
ThS_home:[~]# mount -V
mount: mount-2.9o
I tried also with modutils-2.1.121 ...
But (eg):
ThS_home:[~]# lsmod
Module                  Size  Used by
ThS_home:[~]# cat /dev/loop0
ThS_home:[~]# lsmod
Module                  Size  Used by
loop                    7520   0  (autoclean)
ThS_home:[~]# rmmod loop
ThS_home:[~]# lsmod
Module                  Size  Used by
ThS_home:[~]# cat /dev/loop0
ThS_home:[~]# lsmod
Module                  Size  Used by
loop                    7520   0  (autoclean)
ThS_home:[~]# 
Any clues ?
My .config is attached ...
