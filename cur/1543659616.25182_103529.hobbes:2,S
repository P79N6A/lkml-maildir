I didn't know about undefined weak symbols.  I was thinking:
int nosupport_function(void)
{
	return -ENOSYS;
}
extern int support_function(void)
	__attribute__((alias("nosupport_function"), weak));
....
int init(void)
{
	/* Or you could simply call it... */
	if (support_function == nosupport_function)
		...
Of course, you can use symbol_get and symbol_put, too, but they don't
work if !CONFIG_MODULES: I chose to implement that case as simply a
reference, so you'll get a link failure: see linux/module.h.
