I have to wonder why Glibc's <sys/syscall.h> doesn't define these
macros, but instead includes <asm/unistd.h> which is a kernel header.
Here is a fine example of something that should not be using the kernel
header.  Glibc should define the macros, and include PIC-safe varieties.
The fix here is to file a bug report for Glibc.
Or you could just use the syscall() function from Perl ;-)
