Hi,
After a long development time, I'm pleased to announce that version 1.16e
of ide-tape.c is available for testing. This version introduces IDE tape
driver support for the OnStream DI-30 tape drive (www.onstream.com), and
was developed using technical information and assistance from OnStream.
I have tested this version with the 15/30GB OnStream tape drive, and with
my old 2/4GB Conner tape drive.
Attached in the archive are two source files: (1) ide-tape-1.16e-2.2.x.c,
which is a drop-in replacement for drivers/block/ide-tape.c in 2.2.x,
(2) ide-tape-1.16e-2.3.x.c, and (3) ide-tape-release-notes-1.16.
I'd like to send an update for ide-tape.c to Linus soon for inclusion
into the 2.3 series. Please test the driver and send me any comments
which you might have, particulary if the new version of the driver breaks
support for your non-OnStream ATAPI tape drive.
Thanks, and enjoy the driver,
Gadi
