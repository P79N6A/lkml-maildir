Watching this whole event logging thing for a while, I wonder if a
slightly different approach might not be better.  Instead of adding
extra kernel functionality, would it not be possible to define a text
format to messages and some SIMPLE macros, to allow printk's to generate
the desired information.  
I understand about POSIX standards, but POSIX standards are not the
infallible word of of the diety of computing and sometimes are
completely bogos.  While they do provide a thoughtful plan, they are not
IMHO some holy grail.  for silly standards, see the recent stuff about
names for K = 10^6 vs. K= 2^10.
So if one drops strict POSIX compliamce and goes for providing the
information, it maye be possible to provide some formating guidelines
and support to printk and some log analysis tools to provide 99%
solution.
One thing to remember, is that the really hard and important part of
logging is not the part that can be legislated, or automated, it is
making sure that the correct events are reported in a accurate manner,
and this is not a one time job.  This being the case, I would rather see
effort expended in rationalizing the current printk's and improving
their use, than adding some new infrastructure that may well be a
perfromance drain and might even be more prone to loss of log messages,
than the current method.
