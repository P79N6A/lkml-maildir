The following is a hack to illustrate what I'm getting at (this is
tested on x86-64) (it's a hack since it does all the ACPI prepare bits
during set_target() for the pre ACPI 3.0 systems, rather than prepare() -
whether this can be cleaned up to move out just the _PTS() call, I don't
know).
It abuses suspend_ops->set_target(), but was the easiest way to quickly
demonstrate this (since the kerneldoc for set_target() says it will always
be executed before we suspend the devices).
