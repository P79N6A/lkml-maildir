   The guy who sent this is my coworker, and I was watching for the
   email on the list.  He told me when he sent it.  It didn't arrive
   until 10 hours later.  I highly doubt this is optimal.
The machine ran out of disk space right after I went to sleep, once I
woke up I promptly fixed the problem and now the machine has caught up
with it's backlog, relax.
Later,
