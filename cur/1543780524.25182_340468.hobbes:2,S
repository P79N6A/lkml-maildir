Yep.

I understand what you mean, and I agree. Though as far away from the
business end of the drivers I am, I tend to get the feeling that
drivers need the most hand holding.
Anyway, I guess the way to understand the problem is finding the
reason why ioremap checks PageReserved, and whether or not ioremap
should be expected (or allowed) to remap physical RAM in use by
the kernel.
