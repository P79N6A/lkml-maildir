/proc/ide/hdX/settings is the source (directly/indirectly)
for 95% of these special cases.

It is simple.  No settings - you dont hit these places.

Why for hotplug?  We should move all code physically touching
devices to use request queue (REQ_SPECIAL), then you can simply
mark device as unplugged when its gone and check this flag inside
ide_do_request().
When its plugged again its reprobed (you dont need driver for this)
and if its the same device you just clear unplugged flag.
Does it make sense?
With this scheme you also shouldn't need hwif->unplugged_ops hack.
You mark all drives belonging to hwif as unplugged and you are happy.

Ordering is important when converting ide drivers to driverfs.
Then i will need to register ide-default with driverfs and it will
be "stealing" devices.

2. is a proper solution and its not a problem.
Problem is when integrating ide with driverfs.
Then you need to register/unregister ide-default as driverfs driver
and now it can "steal" devices, ie. you have cd drive owned by ide-default,
later you load ide-cdrom driver and your cd drive needs to be unregistered
from ide-default driver first before it can be registered with ide-cdrom
driver - you need to add code to do this or device will be "stealed".
Its not very hard to do but it adds complexity.
