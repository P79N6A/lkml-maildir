You do though... it is right as is (sort of).
It actually can overscan lower zones a little bit, because
whenever any higher zone in the pgdat is low on memory, then
it and all zones below it get scanned too.
So if HIGHMEM is low on memory, NORMAL and DMA get scanned
as well regardless. If NORMAL is low, then DMA gets scanned
as well.
