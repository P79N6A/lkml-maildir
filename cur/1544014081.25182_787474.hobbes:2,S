Well, I recently (Dec 1st or so) had a venerable HDD fail with a couple
of bad sectors; with oldish backups (couple of days) (Samsung SP2004C
plugged to a VIA VT6420 in the south bridge, VT8237).
I couldn't use dd_rescue since the disk drive was detached by the OS
upon the disk's hitting the first error.
If it's a software or hardware fault I cannot say, FreeBSD
7.1-PRERELEASE showed the same behaviour as did the openSUSE 11.0 i686
kernels, but then again it might be either OS losing patience with the
drive doing excessive reads, or the drive actually violating the bus
protocols or hanging. It didn't need power cycling though, detaching and
reattaching the ATA bus was sufficient.
For me, recovery was possible with rsync (or cp -Rp): run rsync -avH
until the drive froze, figure which file was affected, note the name,
remount the drive, rm the affected file, and continue.
Is there a "don't retry reads" setting in the kernel that I miss?
(I still have the drive, so I can try some error handling patches if
desired.)
