If it is created on the fly, it should be "easy" to destroy on the fly
using time-based expiry, i.e. a kernel daemon going over all of those
beasts every X seconds (X = 5 perhaps?) and doing something like:
for (each vfsmount) {
	lock_vfsmount(vfsmount);
	if (MOUNT_IS_BUSY(vfsmount)) {
		unlock_vfsmount(vfsmount);
		continue;
	}
	if (current_time() < (vfsmount->last_used_time +
			vfsmount->expire_after)) {
		unlock_vfsmount(vfsmount);
		continue;
	}
	destroy_locked_vfsmount(vfsmount);
}
Wouldn't that work?

But that defeats the whole point of the hybrid objects!  We might as
well just keep the xattrs interface and throw away the new one if we
will have to keep the old one anyway so that we can do named
streams/attributes on directories.  Windows (and other OS?) certainly do
allow them and do use them on directories as well as files...

Ah, but at least in other OS (Windows is the one I know about)
directories _also_ have the same semantics as files with respect to
named streams/attributes.
