NPTL vs. LinuxThreads is a purely Linux-specific (well, glibc-specific, 
perhaps) issue, it is merely an implementation detail of the POSIX 
pthreads functions which are present on other UNIX variants. A portable 
application should not care which (if either) is being used.
I'm presuming that the fact that setuid calls with LinuxThreads do not 
change the user ID on all threads is a violation of the POSIX pthreads 
specification.
