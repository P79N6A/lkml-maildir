Hi,

It changes the keycode the kernel is sending for three keys. For normal 
keyboards there is usually no argument to which keycode to send. An 'a' 
would send the keycoe for an 'a'. This however is a remote control. The 
keys are labled 'OK', 'TV' and 'DVD'. Therefore the kernel currently 
sends the keycodes KEY_OK, KEY_TV and KEY_DVD. The patch changes this to 
KEY_ENTER, KEY_PROG1 and KEY_PROG2.
I do not know about the motivation of this patch, as the kernel 
currently _does_ send keycodes, maybe just not the ones the some users 
might want. IMHO this is an issue of remapping the keycodes in userspace 
and I would like to leave the kernel-codes alone. However, I might not 
see the whole problem here because it is working fine for me.

How can I tell the consoles of linux which keyboard to use? So far they 
all use all keyboards (which is my usual keyboard mixed with the remote 
control keys). (Yes, I searched google extensivly and no, I do not have 
X on that machine.)
