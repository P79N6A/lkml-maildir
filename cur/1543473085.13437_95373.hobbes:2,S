My box stops after memory is freed (40K).
Previously it said hda didn't have a driver and had a panic.
So I compiled in all the drivers I saw in menuconfig, and now VFS is
mounted, but it stops after freeing memory without saying anything.
It's a cyrix chip (6x68 PR200 - 150 megahertz), a generic pentium board
(PCI bridge), and a Western Digital. 
Any Ideas?
P.S. I'd love to get more info If I knew what to give.. :)
