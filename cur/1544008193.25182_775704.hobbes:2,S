This almost exactly describes problems I've been seeing on my HP 2510p. I 
never tried Alt-SysRq-b and have not seen the spontaneous power-off, but 
the percentage correct boots and relationship with the sound driver are 
spot on.
I worked around the sound driver relationship by using a very low power 
save setting so I can virtually count on it being disabled when I 
suspend.
I'll give your patch a go and report the results. Nice work!
Cheers,
