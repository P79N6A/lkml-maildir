Reading the below, I think I just misinterpreted what you meant by 
"repeate rate". My point was that if you hardly ever run that section
of code, -Os might be better. If we call how often you call that code
section it's "frequency" (nothing to do with how tightly it loops inside
it), then if the frequency of the code is low, the icache footprint 
might be better off smaller, as it'll just blow the icache when we do
run it and those cachelines are fetched. On the other hand, that won't
happen often, so it may well be unobservable for real loads.
