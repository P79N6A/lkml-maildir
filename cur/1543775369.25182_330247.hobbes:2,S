Hi all ;),
I just patched 2.6.12 kernel with the inotify latest patch
(inotify-0.23-rml-2.6.12-14.patch). Inotify is working ok with the test program
provided in inotify-utils but... I can no longer mount my IDE cdrom devices
:(. Each time i try to mount a disc, the mount proccess get stuck in D state. I
don't see what's the relation between inotify and IDE devices, but if i switch
back to the unpatched 2.6.12, mounting works again.
Any ideas? Thanks
