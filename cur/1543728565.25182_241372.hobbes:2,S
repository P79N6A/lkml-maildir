This protects disks in practice but SG_IO is currently supported by other 
devices, at least SCSI tapes. It is reasonable in some organizations to 
give r/w access to ordinary users so that they can read/write tapes. I 
would be worried if this would enable the users, for instance, to mess up 
the mode page contents of the drive or change the firmware.
