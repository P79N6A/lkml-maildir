earlyprintk= is needed for seeting bootconsole, or setting CON_BOOT,
and it is could be loaded earlier with early_param than console_init.
in the console_init (via register_console), the console is handed over
from bootconsole to normal console.
also console_init could be moved to quite late than current, and till
some subsystem is initialized like pci and usb.
