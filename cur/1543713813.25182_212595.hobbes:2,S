Thanks for making these changes!
I recently used the _rcu list primitives for the audit framework and I
found that, even though I read the header file comments and the papers
that were referenced, and even though I then had a good understanding of
RCU, I missed some implementation details about how the primitives
themselves should be used inside the Linux kernel.
These new comments fill in those missing details -- I hope they are
accepted into the kernel.
