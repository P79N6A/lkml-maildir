 In the irq-pio branch, the HSM code has been seperated out from
ata_host_intr() to ata_hsm_move() as static function currently.
Maybe we can export ata_hsm_move() as external?
I didn't look into how sil3611 hotplug interacts with PIO HSM.
Don't know whether this is good enough for the need of sata_sil.
