Well it oopses on writes everytime in Ubuntu 8.04 (Hardy). I'd planned
on digging into
it more before spending a bug report, but will send it tonight after
getting to the affected
machine.
With 1 volume on 1 disk, 2 volumes raid1 on 2 disks, or with 2 volumes
raid0 on 2 disks.
something like:
echo omg > /mnt/btrfs/file
Would segfault, exit the current shell, and leave a nice stack trace
in the kernel's ring buffer.
The file gets created as 0 bytes. Unlinking the file works fine via
rm, but any sort of write fails.
Tried and reproduced the bug with stdout redirection, cp, and dd to a
btrfs v0.14 volume.
Will send the report later today.
