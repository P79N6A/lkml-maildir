I'll be the first to admit there is some ugliness in my driver.
Some originates from accepted methods when the
driver originated. (points 1 and 2 above)
Some comes from doing new things with only the
existing infrastructure, because changing the infrastructure
is deemed too intrusive. (points 3 and 4 above)
Stable infrastructure is good, but sometimes ugliness results.
Some is the result of genuine mistakes (people who
have written nothing but perfect code flame away).
I fix these as they are found through use and review,
and the code improves. (I *really do* want my driver to work!)
As new facilities and guidelines are made available,
I *gladly* and *gratefully* use them, and the code improves.
Calling driver writers stupid and devising punitive measures
to 'cause them pain' seems less useful.
