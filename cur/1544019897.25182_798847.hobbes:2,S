Subject: [patch 1/2] epoll: fix epoll's own poll
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2009/1/29/482

The follwing patch fixes a bug inside the epoll's f_op->poll() code, that
returns POLLIN even though there are no actual ready monitored fds.
The bug shows up if you add an epoll fd inside another fd container (poll,
select, epoll).
The problem is that callback-based wake ups used by epoll, does not carry
(patches will follow, to fix this) any information about the events
that actually happened. So the callback code, since it can't call the file*
->poll() inside the callback, chains the file* into a ready-list.
So, suppose you added an fd with EPOLLOUT only, and some data shows up on
the fd, the file* mapped by the fd will be added into the ready-list
(via wakeup callback).
During normal epoll_wait() use, this condition is sorted out at the time
we're actually able to call the file*'s f_op->poll().
Inside the old epoll's f_op->poll() though, only a quick check
!list_empty(ready-list) was performed, and this could have led to reporting
POLLIN even though no ready fds would show up at a following epoll_wait().
In order to correctly report the ready status for an epoll fd, the ready-list
must be checked to see if any really available fd+event would be ready in
a following epoll_wait().
Operation (calling f_op->poll() from inside f_op->poll()) that, like wake ups,
must be handled with care because of the fact that epoll fds can be added
to other epoll fds.
