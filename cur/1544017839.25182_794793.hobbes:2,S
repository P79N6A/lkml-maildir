So for the CSS ID case, we could solve this by not populating
css_id->css until creation is guaranteed to have succeeded? (We'd
still allocated the css_id along with the subsystem, just not complete
its initialization). cgroup.c already knows about and hides the
details of css_id, so this wouldn't be hard.
The question is whether other users of css_tryget() might run into
this problem, without using CSS IDs. But currently no-one's using
css_tryget() apart from you, so that's a problem we can solve as it
arises.
I think we're safe from css_get() being used in this case, since
css_get() can only be used on css references obtained from a locked
task, or from other pointers that are known to be ref-counted, which
would be impossible if css_tryget() can't succeed on a css in the
partially-completed state.
