Yes, it can be done. It's slow, ineffecient and dangerous (rename
a file, lose the thumbnail... so you'd have to do some garbage
collection on the thumbnail cache).
Thumbnails are actually an *excelent* example of a multistream
file. Renaming/moving a file leaves the image<->thumbnail link
intact. Removing the image removes the thumbnail. Copying the
file to another multistream-file capable machine also copies the
thumbnail, saving you the time to regenerate the thumbnail.
When the target machine doesn't understand a multistream file,
you simply lose the thumbnail, no harm done.
