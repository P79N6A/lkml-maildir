Hi Esben,
I just wondered if you are talking about the scenario where an interrupt
is executing on one processor, and gets preempted. Then some code runs
on the same CPU, which does local_irq_disable (now preempt_disable), to
keep that IRQ from running, but the IRQ thread is already started?
In the community kernel, this could never happen, because IRQs can't be
preempted. But in RT, its possible an IRQ could be preempted, and under
some circumstance, this sequence could occur.
Is that is what you are talking about? If not, it might be over my head,
and I am sorry. If so, I think that scenario is covered under SMP.
