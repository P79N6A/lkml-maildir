Boot failure on x86_64 (64X2), says it can't find init, specifically 
/init. 2.6.23-rc1-git1 boots and runs successfully. I haven't tried 
-git2. I shall reboot on 2.6.23-rc1-git3 tomorrow and record the full 
message.
Strings from vmlinux in both the above:-
Kernel alive
/dev/console
<4>Warning: unable to open an initial console.
<4>Failed to execute %s
<4>Failed to execute %s.  Attempting defaults...
/sbin/init
/etc/init
/bin/init
/bin/sh
No init found.  Try passing init= option to kernel.
Tried option "init=/sbin/init" and got the same failure.
Regards
Sid.
