It is complex :-(.
HOTPLUG_CPU is pretty solid for the case how _suspend_ uses it (ie
drivers quiescent).
It is also known broken for _other_ uses. (There was flamewar about
that recently).
I'm not sure how to express that in Kconfig language without
uglyness... We probably could split HOTPLUG_CPU into
HOTPLUG_CPU_SUSPEND_ONLY (not experimental) and HOTPLUG_CPU (enables
/sysfs interface)... but I do not think that is good idea. (It would
also make suspend debugging a bit harder).
