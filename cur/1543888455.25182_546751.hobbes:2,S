Hi Christoph,
I almost have completed UDF style conversation (the only thing to do
is to check all I've changed). And I've been striked down by the simple
question: the conversion I've done is over 2.6.22-rc1 but meantime in -mm
tree two my patches already exist so should I take them into account while
converting UDF style?
