Yes, I'll do that now.  With the resume feature also calling these functions,
I'm even less comfortable with it.
Shall I resurrect the 2nd cpumask in the task struct from my original patches,
(and one that akpm also suggested more than a year ago)?
Basically, it looks like this:

The primary concern is that there is only one temp, so I had also put in a warning
if it was already in use.  But the scope of where it's used is very short-lived,
so I don't know if a preempt_disable() is required, but it seems the safe thing
to do.
THanks,
