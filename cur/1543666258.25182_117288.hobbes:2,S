kqueue can do all three variants (1st with EV_CLEAR, 3rd with EV_ONESHOT).
So, result of this whole epoll work is trivially predictable - Linux will have
analog of "overbloated" and "poorly designed" kqueue, but more poor
and with incompatible interface, adding its own stone to hell of
different APIs. Congratulations.
Linus was true: Linux is just for fun, not for work.
I say nothing bad for the real work to implement it. But the person who said
"Do poor, do incompatible, but do our own" should be blamed. You know him.
