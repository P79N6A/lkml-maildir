Can you grep inode_cache /proc/slabinfo to see whether you saved any
memory at all?
You need to save 48 bytes per inode to fit one more into a slab with
a 32 byte L1 cache slot; 120 bytes per inode, 64 byte L1 cache slot.
And that's just a generic inode_cache object.  Something that is really
used, like ext3_inode_cache or nfs_inode_cache is going to take more
doing.  Moving a field from the generic inode to the filesystem specific
inode acheives nothing.
