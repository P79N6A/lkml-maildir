How about:
/*

This is really hackish.  If you want to zero a userspace page, just zero
it in the caller's code, or call a different function.  Zeroing a
userspace page has nothing to do with copying a highmem page, and it
really shouldn't be here.  Just changing it from taking a 0 to a -1 from
the last time you posted it doesn't really make it any better.
Also, that function might belong in the same area as copy_highpage(),
not in some driver.  In any case, it certainly needs a big fat comment
explaining why it is special, and different from copy_highpage().
If it shouldn't be moved and really is isolated to the mem.c driver, it
needs to be declared static.
