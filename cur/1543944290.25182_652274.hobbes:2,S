I don't disagree with this, but I think I should point out that making
something "obviously good" may be pretty hard.  It's clearly a common
case that the infrastructure change goes through several rounds of
change -- perhaps prompted by exposure in -mm that shows a subtle
issue.  So then if all other maintainers based their trees on this
tree, we're left with two not-so-great alternatives:
 1) merge the original, broken infrastructure change into your
    (Linus's) tree, leaving a known problem for bisecters to trip
    over.
 2) rebase the world.
I don't know if there's really a perfect answer here.  I hope that
tree-wide infrastructure breakage is uncommon enough that we can just
handle these issues "by hand" as they come up.
