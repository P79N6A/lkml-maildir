Hi Dave,
I am not sure if the problem is with memcpy_toio() itself because
I found that the kernel crash occurred even when I replaced the
memcpy_xxio() calls with readl() and writel(). The panic occured
during the memory transfer. We tried looking at the PCI bus
using an analyzer but found nothing wrong.
Thanks,
Suneeta

memcpy_toio() in 2.4 is still using memcpy() which could use prefetch()
if you compile for certain processors.  Prefetching io space could do
all sorts of nasties.
2.5 changed this define (in include/asm-i386/io.h) to use __memcpy
instead, which doesn't use prefetching.
