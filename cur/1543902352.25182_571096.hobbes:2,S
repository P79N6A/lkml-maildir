 Hmm, TURBOchannel is not PCI, but is still accessible with 
{read,write}{b,w,l}().

 I would have thought this is to be resolved within ioremap() so that 
drivers can be made portable without twisting your arms.  With the more 
recent ioport_map() call that may be extended to port I/O type devices as 
well.  The Alpha with its dense and sparse I/O space proves it can be done 
for arbitrarily complicated arrangements.
