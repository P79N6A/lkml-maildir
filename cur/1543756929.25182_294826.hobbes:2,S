The throughput here is really weird. Reservation code does not touch 
read code path. I could imagine that it maybe change the disk layout and 
make a difference on sequential reads, but I am not sure how it will 
affect the random read. And this is happening on 1 thread and 4 threads, 
but for 2 threads, reservation case is the best. I will see if I could 
repeat the same results here.
