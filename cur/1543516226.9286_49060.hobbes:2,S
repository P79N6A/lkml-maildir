Traditionally, unix man pages (or at least the ones that _used_ to come
with GNU/Linux systems) have had a 'portability' or 'compatibility'
section that gave information about POSIX compliance, whether the
feature was linux-specific, specific to linux and BSD, or whatever.
I've always felt that to be comfortable and useful...I could always look
up a function and know what sort of mess I was going to get myself into
as regards portability.
