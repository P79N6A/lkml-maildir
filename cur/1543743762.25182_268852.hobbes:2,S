One strength is the fact that it boots in a couple of seconds, while
my current 2.6.9 with vendor boot scripts takes minutes.
Another strength is the weight - exactly 2 kg.
I write letters, papers, lecture notes and stuff.
It feels faster than modern machines.
Only need X, TeX, emacs and rsh, rcp.

each user its own virtual machine (and could run itself under itself).
Small is beautiful. Six times? Today for me is

Probably I select more filesystems than you do.
