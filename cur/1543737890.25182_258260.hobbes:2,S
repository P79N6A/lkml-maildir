Yes - but we are using code which *requires* the arch define raw_pci_ops.
See drivers/acpi/osl.c:acpi_os_initialize()
#ifdef CONFIG_ACPI_PCI
	if (!raw_pci_ops) {
		printk(KERN_ERR PREFIX "Access to PCI configuration space unavailable\n");
		return AE_NULL_ENTRY;
	}
#endif

Agreed. I'm not real clear on why drivers/acpi didn't do that.
But apperently ACPI supports many methods to PCI or PCI-Like (can you
guess I'm not clear on this?) config space. raw_pci_ops supports
multiple methods in i386. ia64 only happens to use one so far.
It seems right for SN2 to use this mechanism if it needs a different
method.
Willy tried to explain this to me yesterday and I thought I understood
most of it...apperently that was a transient moment of clarity. :^/

Ok. I'm glad it's not just me 'cuz I'm having a bad day.
