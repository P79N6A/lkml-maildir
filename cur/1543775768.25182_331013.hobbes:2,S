In general, these keys generate events that are handled by the hardware.
The kernel never gets told about them. If you disassemble your DSDT, you
may be able to find methods that correspond to the hotkeys - then you
can use the ACPI generic hotkey driver to bind them to events. However,
this isn't always true and is very hardware dependent.
