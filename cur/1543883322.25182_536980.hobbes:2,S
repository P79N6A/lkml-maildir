Well, we had nasty corruption on XFS, caused by thread that was not
frozen and should be. (While the other case leads "only" to deadlocks,
so it is easier to debug.)
The locking point.. when I added freezing to swsusp, I knew very
little about kernel locking, so I "simply" decided to avoid the
problem altogether... using the freezer.
You may be right that locks are not a big problem for the hibernation
after all; I just do not know.
