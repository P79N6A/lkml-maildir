Well, in some case I care about the minor number.
Normally, device name is meaningless, i.e. you can call the device as
you want, the real information comes from the inode, the major number
for the driver, and the minor number as a parameter for the driver. For
instance, if I have a device node and I want to know if it is a SCSI
disk or an ATA disk I make a fstat() and I look at the major number, if
I want to know if it is the first disk or the second, a partition or
not, I look at the minor number.

I didn't know this one but it is very similar.

For the scsi disk, the minor number contains the disk number and the
partition number, if I remember correctly originally minor number were 8
bits (it is not the case now I believe), and SCSI disk id can be from 0
to 15 (4 bits) so it lets only 4 bits for partition number (15
partitions)
