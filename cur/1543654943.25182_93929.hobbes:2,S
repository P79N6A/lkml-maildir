See

 . FreeBSD is the
*only* OS to pass multiple arguments. SUS says nothing about it, and
pretty much every single implementation varies. It does not work
everywhere else.

The *only* thing you can reliably use in #! lines is an interpreter
followed by a single argument with no trailing space. On NetBSD with
bash as /bin/sh:
mjg59@cysteine:/tmp$ cat foo.pl
#!/bin/sh -- # -*- perl -*- -p
mjg59@cysteine:/tmp$ ./foo.pl
/bin/sh: -- # -*- perl -*- -p: unrecognized option
File a bug against perlrun(1).
