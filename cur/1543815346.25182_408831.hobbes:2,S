Please divide all the reservednames into two groups: those build-in
into io.sys/msdos.sys/command.com and those that are added on the fly.
For example, "mscd001" is runtime-registered trhough any atapi CD-ROM
driver and this name is/was usually a user-configurable option. (Bad
guys name it 'README'.)
