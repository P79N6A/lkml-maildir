Quite possibily. It may also be that the card had simply developed a bad

Linux by default uses the BIOS resource assignments. It doesn't know
where those came from other than "the BIOS". Also as most vendors
checksum the ESCD I'd be suprised if an ESCD error caused the problem,
but I guess you can get unlucky.
Cards can simply lose connection especially if in a dirty, damp or
particularly in a vibration high environment. In the shipping industry,
for example, it is not uncommon to dismantle all the cards from a PC and
refit them then tighten all the screws as a routine maintenance activity.
