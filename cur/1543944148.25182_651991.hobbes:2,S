I didn't see anything else earlier on that guaranteed we got the current 
generation in both cases, but I didn't look exhaustively, and you know 
this code a lot better than I do, so I definitely defer to your better 
judgment, just wanted to make sure it had been considered.

Okay, that's what I thought and what I observed in operation.

Gotcha. So basically, a temporary table of devices recently "removed", 
which will expire to full/actual removal after some relatively short 
interval, but which we'll also check for matches of "newly" connected 
devices to see if we should cancel removing the device and just pretend 
like it never actually went away. Right? I wonder if there's any sort of 
guidance on this sort of thing in the firewire specs... I'll make an 
effort to search for relevant info, unless you've already got it.

Heh, sounds good. I missed out on my entire past weekend (and half a 
week of work) due to family illnesses. Hoping to throw a bunch of time 
at further firewire work this week though.
