A while back I wrote up a patch for autofs3 that serialized waitq access 
and changed the waitq counters to atomic_t.  I never sent it out because 
I had realized that the changes I made weren't needed as all waitq 
code-paths were running under the BKL (the big ones were ->lookup and 
the ioctls). 
Looking briefly at autofs4, this appears to be the case as well, so this 
serializing probably isn't needed as long as care is made not block 
while walking the list.
