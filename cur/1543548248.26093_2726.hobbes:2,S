NP. Yes, why not?
It's worth a try. Thanks for the hint.
or force the BIOS to enable DMA
Nope. Unfortunately, this is impossible. Award 4.51 PG does NOT support DMA
setting in the BIOS:
Only newer BIOSes do.
UDMA is displayed in the box with both my Maxtor and IBM HDs, however, you
cannot set
DMA explicitly _in_ the BIOS setup.
But I'll give this idea with the modified kernel a try.

Thanks.

"TiVo hackbed"? =) Do you mean a terminal you type in when you're lying on
the bed, by chance? =)
