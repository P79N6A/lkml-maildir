Yep, and I've noticed meanwhile that it becomes quite messy if you try 
to do that with asm instructions which have both input and output 
parameters.  One way around that would be to use named parameters in the 
inline assembler.  Problem with that is that only gcc >= 3.1 understands 
those and at the moment the minimun requited compiler for the kernel 
still is gcc 2.95.3 according to Documentation/Changes ...
Is it an option to raise the required gcc version to 3.x, given that 
even Debian/stable ships with gcc 3.3 these days?
cheers,
   Gerd
