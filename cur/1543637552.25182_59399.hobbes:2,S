I agree on the pci_lock item.
And yes CMD640 chips where quite common on Sparcs about 4-6 years ago.
I think some Alpha based systems used them too... but I'm not sure.
Regarding the locking issue. I think the best place to
put it would be just before call down to the corresonding low level
functions in the generic IDE layer. We may "overlock" a bit here -
But who cares?  This is by no way a time critical operation.
