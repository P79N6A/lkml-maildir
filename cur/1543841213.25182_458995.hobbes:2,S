I've already used it (it's what I was using when to maintain the 2.4-hf
tree in parallel to Marcelo's mainline). But it's useful when you have
*a few* patches. I'm really speaking about *thousands* of patches that
get merged into 2.6 every few months and this is what makes the job difficult.
Not to mention that they also get merged in 2.6-mm in advance, or that
sometimes they are obsoleted and/or replaced by something else.
Clearly, I'm not going to track all 2.6 patch by patch to maintain 2.4 !
The most scalable workflow is distributed, and should be oriented towards
push and not pull. We just have to ensure that *someone* takes care of
each patch and tracks it up to its merge.
