Let's start with the read side.  You are using the generic sendfile now
which is the same as the generic read routine as far as the filesystem
is concerned.  What more do you need for read performance than a proper
mpage_readpage(s) that can use the extent-enabled get_blocks callback?
I'll post a patch for that ASAP, it benefits the other filesystems aswell.
I know the write path is more complex, and doing your on ->writepage(s)
is fine because that may need to do a lot of FS-specific things.  I'd
really like to see you use generic_file_write or at least the major
routines it's built from.  What's missing for you to do that?  Note
that you read/write path will need a major rewrite anyway due to the
flaws I pointed out, and I think it would benefit both you (less
maintaince overhead, feature and bug parity) and the other
filesystem/vfs/vm hackers (less duplicate functionality to worry about,
improvement you make shared by every filesystem) if you tried to
converge to use common code.
