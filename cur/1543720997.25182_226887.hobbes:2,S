Hmmm, yes.  Does this not mean that we will violate the object size N will be aligned at size N.  Presumably that's why the error says 'it'll crash'.  If we are two pages offset we will allocate 4 page objects 2 page aligned.  I'll have a closer look and see if we can just 'round down' the zone_mem_map pointer here to give the correct alignment.  As long as we don't try and free them into the allocator originally we should be ok, as they are marked allocated in the bitmaps at the start.
