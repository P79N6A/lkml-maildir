Yes, that's what I mean.  Basically it'd use a dependency of some sort.
 It's not really clear to me right at the moment which is best, too.
Also attached another followon bug fix patch; again, you don't need to
resubmit for this.

Subject: [PATCH] bzip2/lzma: handle failures from bzip2 and lzma correctly
Impact: Bug fix
If bzip2 or lzma fails (for example, if they aren't installed on the
system), we need to propagate the failure out to "make".  However,
they were masked by being followed by a semicolon.
