With such rate of changes, good luck doing that.
Good example is sysctl checks. There was initial influx of reports and
they were fixed and there were no sysctl reports recently.

It's impractical as in it's extremely boring to read every modules init
function and propagate return values in mind.

I love BUG_ON and BUILD_BUG_ON very much but on such scale you can't
just throw them in.
Here goes version 2 with improved changelog. Let's put in -mm and see
what happens, then put it in mainline and see what happens.
[PATCH v2] Whine about suspicious return values from module's ->init() hook
Return value convention of module's init functions is 0/-E. Sometimes, e.g.
during forward-porting mistakes happen and buggy module created, where result
of comparison "workqueue != NULL" is propagated all the way up to
sys_init_module. What happens is that some other module created workqueue in
question, our module created it again and module was successfully loaded.
Or it could be some other bug.
Let's make such mistakes much more visible. In retrospective, such messages
would noticeably shorten some of my head-scratching sessions.
Note, that dump_stack() is just a way to get attention from user.
Sample message:
sys_init_module: 'foo'->init suspiciously returned 1, it should follow 0/-E convention
sys_init_module: loading module anyway...
Pid: 4223, comm: modprobe Not tainted 2.6.24-25f666300625d894ebe04bac2b4b3aadb907c861 #5
