please stop trolling.
I gave you a polite answer that the exact same question was asked
recently, and answered. If you are then too lazy to go look in the
archive even then..... ok here is it:
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0601.0/1840.html
I even pointed out a mailinglist that's best suited for detailed
follow-on questions. 
Your "political" and other crap you're spewing here shows that you're
not actually interested in the answer, but just want to start a
flamewar. THAT is not reasonable on linux-kernel. If you want to start a
flamewar at least do it for a technical topic/reason.
