Hi, I am getting this message when I scroll large windows in X while
playing sound:
kernel: Sound: DMA (output) timed out - IRQ/DRQ config error?
However, the video card and the sound card are on different interrupts:
cat /proc/interrupts

  Bus  0, device  11, function  0:
    VGA compatible controller: Matrox Mystique (rev 2).
      Medium devsel.  Fast back-to-back capable.  IRQ 12.  Master
Capable.  Latency=32.  
      Non-prefetchable 32 bit memory at 0xe1000000 [0xe1000000].
      Prefetchable 32 bit memory at 0xe0000000 [0xe0000008].
      Non-prefetchable 32 bit memory at 0xe0800000 [0xe0800000].
Perhaps this is the fault of the X server somehow? 
I have a UP PPro and a SB16 sound card, a Realtek 8026 ethernet card,
and an IDE hard drive.  My glibc is 2.0.7.19981211-2.
