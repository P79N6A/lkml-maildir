That looks wrong (it produces a pointer of 0d00:0000). It looks like the  
first line has a 0 missing, which would make the linear address 0x000d0000  
and the segmented address d000:0000 where it is quite probable to actually  
find a ROM.

Well, dpaddr looks like it's supposed to be the physical address, so you'd  
say something like
    rom = phys_to_virt(dpaddr); /* map into a virtual address */
BUT see Documentation/IO-mapping.txt if perhaps you need to use readb()  
and friends instead.
HOWEVER, if the first line above actually *is* the correct address, then  
you're in serious trouble, because that's in the first 64kB of RAM, and  
what's there is *completely* different between DOS and Linux.
