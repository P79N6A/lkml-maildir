+config ROMFS_ON_BLOCK
+	bool "Block device-backed ROM file system support"
+	depends on ROMFS_FS && BLOCK
+	help
+	  This permits ROMFS to use block devices buffered through the page
+	  cache as the medium from which to retrieve data.  It does not allow
+	  direct mapping of the medium.
+
+	  If unsure, answer Y.

+config ROMFS_ON_MTD
+	bool "MTD-backed ROM file system support"
+	depends on ROMFS_FS && MTD
+	help
+	  This permits ROMFS to use MTD based devices directly, without the
+	  intercession of the block layer (which may have been disabled).  It
+	  also allows direct mapping of MTD devices through romfs files under
+	  NOMMU conditions if the underlying device is directly addressable by

So we require that one of these be enabled if ROMFS.
There's a way of doing that, but I forget what it is.  iirc Adrian has done
this in the past and can perhaps point us at an example?
