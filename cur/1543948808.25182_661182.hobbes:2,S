Follow-up...   this is already becoming a PITA.
I am going through and rebasing multiple repos in the same repository... 
and it keeps running 'git gc' on each branch!  grrrr.
Step 1:
pull "../linux-2.6" into master branch of local repo.  this repo was 
created with "--reference".  It _might_ be reasonable to expect 'git gc' 
to be run:

Step 2:
In the same repo, rebase a branch (contains a single changeset), 
immediately following step #1:

Step 3:
Ditto, a second rebase in the same repo, immediately following step #2:
> [jgarzik@pretzel libata-dev]$ git-checkout new-eh && git-rebase master
> Switched to branch "new-eh"
> First, rewinding head to replay your work on top of it...

Step 4:
Ditto, a third rebase in the same repo, immediately following step #3:
> [jgarzik@pretzel libata-dev]$ git-checkout mv-ahci-pata && git-rebase master
> Switched to branch "mv-ahci-pata"

Will the 'git gc' never end???
