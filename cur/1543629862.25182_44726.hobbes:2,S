Yep.  I sent Alan a few more scheduler updates - if he puts them in
pre8-ac2, that may break the diff but still nothing incompatible. 
Always assume (with most patches, really) that if it applies, it is
fine.
An exception would be things like lock-break or low-latency that assume
intricate knowledge of the locking and calling semantics of functions. 
If they apply, they should compile and boot, but a deadlock may lurk. 
This is partly why these solutions are horrible to maintain or get right
and the preemptible kernel is a wiser long-term solution to latency and
such.
