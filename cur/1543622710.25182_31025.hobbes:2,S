This is what I meant too, and I was talking about the interrupt 
frequency because if there are too many IT, continuous polling might
be more efficient than interrupt handling with the kernel driver + 
userspace signal sending.

It depends on the driver. If moving _all_ the driver in kernelspace
involves putting policy and other stuff into the kernel, then no.
