An 82 entry patchbomb to the mailing lists is unacceptable and is
going to kill vger.kernel.org, please don't do this.
If you cannot condense your patch set into a smaller set of patches (I
think you really could for this one), then only post say 10 or so at a
time and wait for review and integration.
Kernel janitor-like patches split up their work _FAR_ too much.  They
post one patch per driver, or even per-file, for something as simple
as removing the use of a redundant header file.  That's totally
rediculious, and bloats up the kernel changelog history for no good
reason.  Instead, you should just post one big patch for all of
drivers/, one for all of net/, something like that.
Thanks.
