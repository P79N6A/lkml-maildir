Hi,
how can I be sure what's wrong in my system, is it kernel or
is it after all hardware !?
What tests to do !?
I've already tried changing DIMM RAMs, IDE cables, even
changed IDE disk. There are few things I can't change before I'm
certain that it is flaky or bad and those are SCSI disks, P2 350
procesors and mobo.
System is headless dual P2/350, IDE + SCSI (aic7xxx), 128M RAM.
Few things I've noticed  ->
almost always is either IDE led turned on or SCSI led turned on
when hang occurs. ( I've connected IDE and SCSI to separate box leds)
Two days ago, UP compiled 2.2.13 kernel hanged also, so it isn't SMP+IDE issue.
Interesting though that with mem=64M box hung only once, don't remember
which kernel was it any more.
Lately after reboot serial module does not load properly, if I rmmod it
and modprobe it later it is all fine. Serial is modularized because
box has two external modems on ttyS0 and ttyS1 and internal PnP one.
I get these in logs :
Nov  2 12:46:53 zagreb kernel: Serial driver version 4.27 with no serial options enabled
Nov  2 12:46:53 zagreb kernel: ttyS00 at 0x03f8 (irq = 4) is a 16550A
Nov  2 12:46:53 zagreb kernel: ttyS01 at 0x02f8 (irq = 3) is a 16550A
Nov  2 12:46:53 zagreb kernel: ttyS02 at 0x03e8 (irq = 4) is a 16550A
Nov  2 12:46:53 zagreb modprobe: post-install /lib/modules/2.2.7/misc/serial.o failed
Nov  2 12:46:53 zagreb modprobe: post-install /lib/modules/2.2.7/misc/serial.o failed
Nov  2 12:46:53 zagreb mgetty[1221]: mod: cannot open line /dev/ttyS2: Device or resource busy
Nov  2 12:46:53 zagreb mgetty[1221]: open device /dev/ttyS2 failed: Device or resource busy
Nov  2 12:46:53 zagreb mgetty[1221]: cannot get terminal line dev=ttyS2, exiting: Device or resource busy
relevant line in /etc/modprobe.conf is
post-install serial /bin/setserial /dev/ttyS2 irq 7
Could that be enough of a proof that MoBo is failing !?
I mean, after proper modprobe loading serial ports are doing fine.
