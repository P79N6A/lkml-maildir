kmap() just returns page_address() on ppc64, as there's no highmem.
kunmap() is a no-op.
So technically I could just use page_address() directly, but Christoph wanted
me to keep the kmap()/kunmap() sequence because it's considered a good
practice.

So should I replace it by e.g. KM_IRQ0?
I'm not so familiar with these parts, and I couldn't find what these values
really mean.
