Hi there,
in 2.6.11 the usbnet module is not being loaded for my Zaurus SL-C860 (Vendor 
ID = 044d, Product ID = 9031), which used to work in 2.6.10. (as stated in 
previous post, rc4 and rc5 were also broken).
Moreover, there seems to be a wrong Product ID in usbnet (already in 2.6.9): 
is=9050 should be=9031. Hence my Zarus is being recognized as C-750/760 
(which is fine as 760 and 860 only differ in memsize).
Regards
  Holger Klawitter
