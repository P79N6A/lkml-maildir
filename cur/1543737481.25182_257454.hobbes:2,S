What kind of sata drives?  It's not quite the same end result, but there
have been several posts on linux-raid about defective Maxtor sata drives
causing system freezes.  If your drives are Maxtor, download their
powermax utility and test your drives.  You may find that you have one or
more marginal drives that appear to work most of the time, but powermax
will determine are bad.  Replacing one like that fixed my problems.
