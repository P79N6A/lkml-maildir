if you have your policy figured out and then go and apply it to 
applications then you are correct.
I'm talking about the situation where you start off by defining a policy 
for Samba, and then afterwords decide that you want to have seperate 
"logfile" and "logdaemon" type then you would need to go back and 
re-examine all the files to tell what needs to be labeled as what.
if you can do all the policy design in advance (and get it right) then 
SELinux is a great solution. if you don't have that time and have to do 
the policy incrementaly you will end up revisiting and revising your 
entire policy each time you go to add something.

I _am_ a security professional. I've been doing security sysadmin work on 
Linux for over a decade now. From your description I'm exactly the type of 
person you are saying should be figuring this out. So please back off of 
the 'this is hard, you should leave it to the professionals' line a 
little bit ;-)
if the AA policies can be compiled into SELinux policies that would work 
(currently they can't and many SELinux people oppose the features that 
would need to be added to make it possible) but the compile process leaves 
room for more bugs in an areas that's going to be hard to investigate. 
(This isn't a fault of SELinux, it's a common issue with compilers, the 
compiled 'thing' is designed to be machine friendly, not user friendly. it 
doesn't matte if it's compiling C into machine code or high-level firewall 
rules into iptables commands or AA policies into SELinux labels and 
policies). adding a complex intermediate layer does not nessasarily add 
security, but it definantly adds complication.
once SELinux has a way for a trusted user to edit a security sensitive 
file (via the process of creating a file and renameing it into place) 
without needing SELinux aware tools and have the result accepted as valid 
by the rest of the system then it becomes possible to implement an AA to 
SELinux policy compiler, but saying that AA should not be accepted becouse 
it's possible to modify SELinux and write such a compile with sufficant 
effort is not reasonable. While there are many cases where multiple ways 
of doing something are not allowed into the kernel (suspend/hibernate is 
an example) there are also cases where multiple ways of doing things are 
allowed, and the LSM hooks are in place explicitly to permit different 
types of security modules to use them.
