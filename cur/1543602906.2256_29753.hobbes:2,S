What properties do you mean? I see the only property, they are "hard",
and hence they should be harder to tame. :-) :-)
[ No matter. It is out of topic, but it were you who said about this.
  Did you ever hear about "interrupt mitigation", "hw flowcontrol",
  "polling" eventually? All the schemes work.

I tell you that net_rx_action() already LOOPs so much that it is silly
to loop even more. You multiplied an infinity with 10 and dare to state
that this infinity became larger. I am sorry, it is not.

Big news for me. :-) And how is it related to the issue?

If irq adds new work it is processed immedately without any new hacks.
Look into net_rx_action().

Where did you find priority there? As soon as you see something is enumerated,
it still does not mean that low numbers have some priority.
Argh... I see, what you mean. It is not priority, it is bug introduced
in 2.4.7. (By you? :-)) It was not present before, all the softirq
were processed each round.
Well, just restore old net_rx_action() from 2.4.6.
OK, now I understand your point. You mean that net_rx_action()
is not started immediately, when irq arrives while net_tx_action()
or a timer or something is running. Yes, it is really bad.
But it still does not allow you to restart net_rx_action() 10 times in row.

I am sorry, I do not find anything new in this approach.
Seems, all that you propose is to replace single bit in single word
to some struct. It will take sense when we have more than one real
softirq. :-)

I think that you should change subject to discuss this. :-)
It is not related to the problem.
