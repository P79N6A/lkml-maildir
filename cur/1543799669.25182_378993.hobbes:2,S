I don't think this is a case which is handled by the typical lock
primitives.  Here we essentially have two things being unlocked in
close succession.  The first is the wait queue, the second the futex_q.
There is nothing in the typical unlock path which would require unlocks
to be ordered with respect to each other.  However, in this case, the
futex_q expects to finish processing the wake_up_all before releasing
the lock_ptr.  That is a requirement of wake_futex and not the locking
primitives.  If wake_futex() requires it, then it should be responsible
for enforcing that requirement.
I suppose a step in the right direction would be doing a volatile store
to q->lock_ptr.  I haven't looked, but that should at least prevent the
clearing of lock_ptr until the wait queue is unlocked.
Jack, can you repeat your testing with a cast on the q->lock_ptr line to
a volatile.  After looking at it some more, shouldn't the struct futex_q{}
definition for the spinlock_t *lock_ptr be volatile?
Thanks,
