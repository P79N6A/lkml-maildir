Subject: smbfs 2 GB file size limitation in kernel 2.4.31?

Hello,
according to the changelog of kernel 2.4.25, smbfs should support large
files (>2GB?).
But if I mount a windows XP share on my linux box (kernel 2.4.31),
I still can not copy files larger than 2 GB to the mounted share.
The 'cp' command should work with large files,
because using 'cp' on a local reiserfs does work.
Does anybody know if there is still a 2 GB limitation in smbfs of 2.4.31
and
how to solve it?
Many thanks,
Martin Rauh
