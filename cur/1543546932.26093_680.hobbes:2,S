Screw POSIX, but why do you want to unclone everything? Components are
independent. Really. I can see the point in unclone(CLONE_FILES) _if_
there was close-on-exec. I can see the point in unclone(CLONE_FS) upon
personality change (had to do that during the namei rewrite - alternative
root depends on personality and it's clearly a part of fs_struct). But
what, in the name of Cthulhu, makes us unclone() everything, no matter 
whether we need it or not? E.g. would you really want to get an
independent namespace upon exec()? Goodby mount(8)...
