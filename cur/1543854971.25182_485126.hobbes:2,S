It's a main reason we were against moving arbitrary task.
We need to track the situation when we change beancounter on
task that is currently handles an interrupt and thus set a
temporary BC as exec one. I see no other way that keeps pair
set_exec_bc()/get_exec_bc() lock-less.
The problem is even larger than I've described. set_exec_bc()
is used widely in OpenVZ beancounters to set temporary context
e.g. for skb handling. Thus we need some safe way to "catch"
the task in a "safe" place. In OpenVZ we solve this by moving
only current into beancounter. In this patch set we have to
move arbitrary task and thus - such complication.
I repeat - we can do this w/o stop_machine, but this would
require locking in set_exec_bc()/get_exec_bc() but it's too
bad. Moving tasks happens rarely but setting context is a
very common operation (e.g. in each interrupt).
We can do the following:
  if (tsk == current)
      /* fast way */
      tsk->exec_bc = bc;
  else
      /* slow way */
      stop_machine_run(...);
What do you think?
