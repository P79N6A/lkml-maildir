I have to disagree with you on this. Respect is earned not automatically
given. He might be the father of UNIX but the first incarnations of UNIX
were ugly. and also, I would have thought that he would have at least
TRIED Linux himself, installing it, configurating it, and using it. There
is no substitute, especially with all his background & experience. I think
he has made a big mistake by basing decisions upon some
crippled/broken/badly configured Linux systems that he only used/saw. How
can I give him respect if he did that?
I also take issue about VMS. It's NOT that bad!! It's beautiful! If you
want to see a really broken operating system, I refer you to Windows NT,
but then you knew that didn't you?

I'll concede on that point. But still... 
Cheers,
