Don't be confused when this too eventually breaks when tested.
The counters will wrap, i slightly before j, and that may trigger the
BUG().
For a safe test, change the first loop to:
        i = j = 0;
        for (;;) {      
                i++;   
                j++;   
		if (i == 0x7FFFFFFF) {
			j = 0;
			i = 0;
	         }
