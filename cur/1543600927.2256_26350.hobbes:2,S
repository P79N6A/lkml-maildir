But during the read from the disk you can do different things in
paralell.
Think DMA! And then please remember my posts from a year ago:
We have already 3 different read-ahead layers in Linux!
Read it twice THRE one on top of the other:
1. Physical.
2. Inside the driver.
2a. block device layer.
3. File system layer.
And in addition to this there is:
2a. or maybe even 2b if you take MD and RAID into account as well.
And plase remember that each of them can fight against the other becouse
they all presume different ordering mechanisms.
