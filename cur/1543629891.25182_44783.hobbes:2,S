Dear David,
My scsi is an ADAPTEC AIC-7896 mapped to irq=10, my sound card is an
Ensoniq|ES1371 [AudioPCI-97] mapped to irq=11.

It seems that my scsi is not ISA. When I set in BIOS irq10 to ISA neither the
scsi card or the sound card use irq10.
I am wondering how the scsi could be interfering with the sound card if the two
card are using different IRQs.
Thanks for your help, Joaquin
