Bzzt. The PCMCIA card in question wasn't plugged in at the time so didn't 
get enabled, and autoconfigure didn't realise that the software for it 
actually needed CONFIG_NETLINK_DEV even though it wasn't in use at the time.
The sensible all-modules-under-the-sun vendor kernel had netlink_dev 
available though, just in case. But when she calls the support person who's 
responsible for the pre-installed Linux on her workstation and she
admits that she compiled her own kernel, she gets told to go away.
Pity the people who wrote the driver didn't use the saner approach:
	make -C /lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel SUBDIRS=`pwd` modules
