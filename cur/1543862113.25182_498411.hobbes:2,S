It currently only hooks up OLPC, and I don't have any of
those [hint hint], so I need external testers.  I'll send
the patch to LKML if it does work.  However, the way it
implements the filesystem will need significant changes,
but we'll discuss that later :-)

Yup, the DTC-generated tree is just a single binary blob
from the perspective of passing it around.
