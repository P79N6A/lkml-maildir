That has been done, hasn't it?

If somebody prefers an other OS for license reasons only, let them. You
cannot have open source software without open source license. If a
company chooses Linux, they do it for technical reasons, and because
they're able to modify the sources to suit their needs. Whatever
advantages they see in Linux, they have to know that they have to
accept its license. Just saying "I like your software but
your license is stupid" is childish. Use CE instead.
