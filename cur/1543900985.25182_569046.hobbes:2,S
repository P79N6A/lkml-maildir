Doing this slows down the display rates, but doesn't significantly help 
the smoothness of the gears.

I didn't test this with standard Xorg priority, I should go back and try 
that. But it didn't really make much difference. The gears and scrolling 
xterms ran slower with Xorg at -20 with any sched settings. I'll do that 
as soon as a build finishes and I can reboot.
I should really go back to 2.6.21.6, 2.6.22 has many bizarre behaviors 
with FC6. Automount starts taking 30% of CPU (unused at the moment), the 
sensors applet doesn't work, etc. I hope over the weekend I can get bug 
reports out on all this, but there are lots of non-critical oddities.
