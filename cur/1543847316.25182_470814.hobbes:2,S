Just to add, I've seen right this, too, on Debian's 2.6.17-2-686, with
a 00:07.1 IDE interface: Intel Corporation 82371AB/EB/MB PIIX4 IDE
(rev 01) (8086:7111) PATA controller with a ST3300822A disk. That's
healthy from smartmontool's point of view. The machine has 192MB RAM, an
Intel P3 processor and is idle during daytime, busy with fetching
backups at night. I'm using this filesystem with faubackup, lots of
small files, lots of hard links and a number of large files.  Some of
the posts below mention large files, too.  My impression would be that
it happens when unlink()ing large files.  Oh, and it's a LV, not a
direct partition.
memtest86 didn't reveal anything, too (ran it for nearly 24h.)

	2.6.10, UP, no PREEMPT, 2.4.25 was a lot more stable. Problem
	disappeared by changing the mainboard.
	And a test case:
	~ dd if=/dev/zero of=test0 bs=1M count=300
	~ while :; do cp test0 test1; cp test1 test2; cp test2 test0; od test0; done
	Problem is RAID1 related and doesn't show up on bare disks.

	Author thinks this was 2.6.11.

	Dec 20, 2005, plus Dec 21, 2005 (another guy with the same problem)
	Disk works in one machine (P2), but not in a different box

	The author sees a problem like this when deleting large
	(1GB..2GB) files. ": > $file" before removing them helps. This
	results in an open(x, O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC|O_LARGEFILE)

In one case, there was a test case mentioned. I'll run that on my
affected box in a non-productive LV, like this:
dd bs=1M count=200 if=/dev/zero of=test0
while :; do
	echo "cp 0-1"; cp test0 test1 || break
	echo "cp 1-2"; cp test1 test2 || break
	echo "cp 2-3"; cp test2 test3 || break
	echo "cp 3-4"; cp test3 test4 || break
	echo "od 0" ; od test0 || break
	echo "rm 1"; rm test1 || break
	echo "rm 2"; rm test2 || break
	echo "rm 3"; rm test3 || break
	echo "rm 4"; rm test4 || break
done
After about 30h runtime, I got:
EXT3-fs error (device dm-5): ext3_free_blocks_sb: bit already cleared for block 194810
Aborting journal on device dm-5.
ext3_abort called.
