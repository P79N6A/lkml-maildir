First, the license(s) are stored in the user's home directory (~/.bk/lease)
per hostname.  If you move to a completely different machine, then, yes,
there will need to be a lease for that machine.
What you are describing is no different from the NFS case.  It doesn't
matter that the media has physically moved; it's still visible to multiple,
unique hosts.  Each host(name) will need it's own lease.
