Yes.  I expect that most of the shutdown routines will be made conditional
on something like, like CONFIG_HOTPLUG so you can disable the cleanly.
Or perhaps, device_shutdown will be made a compile time conditional.
But please note a number of 2.4.x drivers are starting to grow reboot
notifiers.  So it appears that some people have needed code to shut
down their driver at reboot time in 2.4.x

In general if a routine takes a long time, that is a bug.

That code was chipset specific, so it may be a good thing for a host bridge
driver to do that but it is by no means generally possible.
