That patch applies "fine" to 2.6.20.1:
linux-2.6.20.1 # patch -p1 --dry-run < /home/maxxer/kerpatch.txt
patching file net/ipv6/ndisc.c
Hunk #2 succeeded at 559 (offset 2 lines).
Hunk #3 succeeded at 638 (offset 4 lines).
Hunk #4 succeeded at 1390 (offset 7 lines).
If this is not the correct fix for that bug I have some other problem,
because this seems to have fixed for me! ;)
Thanks
Maxxer
