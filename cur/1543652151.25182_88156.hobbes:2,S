This includes the first noticeable vmstat change. Now you get
IO-wait time separate from idle time if you run Linux 2.5.41
or later.
There's a Solaris-compatible pmap as well, lacking only the
per-vma resident memory stats that Linux doesn't supply.
(hint, hint... though I don't know where they'd fit)

------------- recent changes -------------
procps-3.0.5 --> procps-3.1.0
vmstat displays IO-wait time instead of bogus "w"
can build w/o shared library (set SHARED=0)
when IO-wait hidden, count as idle, not as sys
pmap command added (like Sun has)
do not crash GNU make 3.79
top slightly faster
procps-3.0.4 --> procps-3.0.5
top tolerates super-wide displays
better (?) RPM generation
XConsole and top.desktop removed
old build system removed
code cleanup
pgrep and pkill get "-o" (oldest matching process)
had vmstat "bi" and "bo" output interchanged on 2.5.xx
fix man page tbl directives
top man page cleaned up
