Now the spellink problem moves to the filenames. Plus rate, limit, average
and eventname can't be read in one swoop anymore, so they will be out of
sync. Also, instead of opening, reading, and closing 1 file, they are now
4. Not relevant for human consumption, but could be a performance
bottleneck for /proc frobbing programs.
