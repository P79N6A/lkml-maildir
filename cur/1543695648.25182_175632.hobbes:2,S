Yes, the blue/cyan/gray colors can be a problem on some displays.
Jan-Benedict Glaw modified menuconfig to support monochrome mode,
so I have merged your patch and his, but instead of replacing the
default menuconfig colors, I added an alternate color theme and
monochrome support to the default color theme.
This patch is available at:
http://developer.osdl.org/rddunlap/menuconfig/menuconfig_alt_mono.patch
Usage is:
make menuconfig MENUCONFIG_COLOR=monochrome|mono|alternate|alt
