Yup, and I still am astonished myself. Reading just the C sources,
there was no way param_sysfs_builtin() could've allowed an empty
string to pass into kernel_param_sysfs_setup() ... which makes me
want to see the fix for this even more, but I can't find it on your ftp
directory any more :-(
Care to resend?
