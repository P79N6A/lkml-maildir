Subject: [PATCH 0/2] Trivial cleanups to virtualization tree
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Not very much of importance here, but the idea for these cleanups
came along during discussion of my last set of patches with Chris
Wright.
One cleans up whitespace, another improves understandability of
the mysterious +/- 1's in the page table init code.
