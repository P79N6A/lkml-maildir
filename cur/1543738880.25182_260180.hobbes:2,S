Poorly.  It's not expected to work with SELinux.  There's no good
stacking yet.

Maybe libselinux should not look around in there unless SELinux is
enabled in kernel.

Yeah, that's workable.  Other options would probably look like putting
stuff in module specific locations, which is more painful.

Userspace won't start in a jail, and once it's up, jailing works (on
rawhide for example).  Admittedly, the label looks a bit funny.
# in jail
$ ps -eM
