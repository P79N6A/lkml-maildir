As suggested by Johannes earlier, it'd be great if you could submit
the various changes (as per Changelog) as _individual patches_ on
the original userspace code. That would be easier for others to review,
and there's lesser chances of bugs / issues leaking in that way.
As for "byte-identical object code", I definitely do *not* think it is
necessarily a requirement / good idea. As long as all the changes
you make are reviewed individually / closely by people here on this
list, there's very low chances of any bugs creeping in. [ F.e. I see
nothing wrong in removing the usage of "register" -- that could clearly
lead to different object code, but with no bugs introduced. ]
