You mean that we're in the state
a) big-dirty-expired inode is on s_dirty
b) small-dirty-not-expired inode is on s_io
sync_sb_inodes() sees the small-dirty-not-expired inode on s_io and gives up?
In which case, yes, perhaps leaving big-dirty-expired inode on s_io is the
right thing to do.  But should we be checking that it has expired before
deciding to do this?  We don't want to get in a situation where continuous
overwriting of a large file causes other files on that fs to never be
written out.
