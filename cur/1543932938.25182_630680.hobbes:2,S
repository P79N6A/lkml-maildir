That doesn't tell for sure your NIC has the specific rev that would
cause the hwbug workaround to be used. But let's assume so, your
combination would still works correctly (maybe a slightly non-optimal
network performance). A non-default mmconf=always option can help
maximize again the performance.
My starting point was that more systems could be supported out-of-the
box (vs not working at all) by using "type 1" more widely,. This would
not break anybody.  And this would not affect performance except on what
I initially called "obscure hardware or systems".
I already acknowledged in the previous email the possibility of a
performance impact, but it is still not clear to me whether it would be
widespread. The example you  mention is a buggy revision of a chip that
was designed to use memory-mapped IO, and has to use config-space
instead because the memory-mapped IO implementation is buggy (in most
cases only when used in combination with certain chipsets). How much
influence should a modest performance impact there influence the
decision-making?
Usually it's better to trade some performance for stability than the
reverse, and you loose the performance anyway when some many people
start using pci=nommconf by default on all their installs.
