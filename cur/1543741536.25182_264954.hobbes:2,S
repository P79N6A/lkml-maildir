Yes, we know.  On the other hand, we're probably pushing 60,000 users or
so who have figured it out by tinkering with the tool.  There is no 
question that there needs to be a BitKeeper book or at least a much more
expanded and updated userguide.

Yup.  We have an open req for a docs person, if you know someone who
wants a fulltime job in the Bay Area or an incredibly exceptional remote
person we're very interested (and I'll shut up about that, I'm not trying
to use the list for free job advertising, just don't want to create the
impression that we don't recognize the issues).

Well if you are paying your support includes that sort of help.  Call
us up and ask for examples or send mail to support and ask for help.
Even if you aren't paying you can always ask, if we can we help people
out promptly.
