I used sginfo from Doug Gilbert's sg utilities (

I believe write cache enabled is the state of the WCE bit and read cache 
enabled is the inverse of the RCD bit, so you have a write through cache.
I think that notwithstanding the spec, most drives are write through (purely 
because of the safety aspect).  I suspect certain manufacturers use write back 
caching to try to improve performance figures (at the expense of safety).
