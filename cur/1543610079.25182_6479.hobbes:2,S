Dear all,
I would like to write a driver for a block device that
is better to be accessed directly without going
through the buffer cache. I read the source code raw.c
and learnt that linux does have raw I/O support.
However, it seems to me that the support only provides
a character device interface to users. Is there a
simple way to maintain the block device interface to
user programs / other parts of the kernel, while
bypassing the buffer cache system?
Since struct block_device_operations does not include
read or write operations, I have considered to
redirect the function pointers in filp->f_op to my own
routines when the device is opened. Is this an
appropriate solution? 
Thank you very much. And please kindly correct me if I
am wrong.
Regards,
Roy Ho
