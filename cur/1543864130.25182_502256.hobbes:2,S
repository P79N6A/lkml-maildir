Thanks, that's reassuring for the hugetlb case, and therefore Adam's
patch should not be delayed.  But it does leave open the question I
was raising in the text you've snipped: if ia64 needs those stringent
REGION checks in its ia64_do_page_fault path, don't we need to add
them some(messy)how in the get_user_pages find_extend_vma path?
