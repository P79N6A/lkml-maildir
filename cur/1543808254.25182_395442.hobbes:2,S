Right. The question was rather like this:
Say we have our non-stable /dev/sr0 mapping to /dev/sg0, and it has got BTL 
1,1,0. Now, if the user starts `cdrecord -dev=1,1,0`,
`ls -l /proc/$(pidof -s cdrecord)/fd/` should show (and in fact did when I 
used ide-scsi back then) /dev/sg0, right?
If so, what's wrong with just opening /dev/sg0 directly (as per user 
request, i.e. cdrecord -dev=/dev/sg0) and sending the scsi commands down 
the fd?
