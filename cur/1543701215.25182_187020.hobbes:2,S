Hi.
This is what i get with a Maxtor 6Y120L0 (2MB cache):
/dev/hda:
 Timing buffer-cache reads:   1320 MB in  2.00 seconds = 659.44 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  140 MB in  3.02 seconds =  46.40 MB/sec
Using:
-d1 -u1 -m16 -c3 -W1 -A1 -k1 -X70 -a 8192
I'm not using raid, its a single disk connected to IDE1 on the motherboard.
Maybe you can try those parameters and see if it helps :)
