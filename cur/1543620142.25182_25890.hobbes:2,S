Thanks.
I will include it _after_ the next release (0.1.3) which will come out within a
couple of days.  Structure of kernelconf has changed a bit, so we will have to
do some sync.  Also, binaries for each type of config are seperate.
BTW, seems as if you have forgotton to `make clean' before making the patch ;)
