It's not so great in the SCSI world either. Here's a bit from the 
Ultrastar 73LZX functional spec (this is the current-technology 
Ultra160 73GB family):

What's worse, though the spec is not explicit on this point, it 
appears that the write cache is lost on a SCSI reset, which is 
typically used by drivers for last-resort error recovery. And of 
course a SCSI bus reset affects all the drives on the bus, not just 
the offending one.
