Hi,
I'm developing some drivers for the AU1000 under
Mountain Vista's 2.4.17 sherman release. The AU1000 is
a MIPS based SOC with a 36 bit internal address bus
and a 32 bit MIPS cpu.  According to the documentation
the MIPS' TLB is able to map 32 bit virtual addresses
to 36 bit physical addresses, however I cannot figure
out how to get Linux to set this up.  I've looked at
ioremap which only takes unsigned long (32bits) as an
argument to assign a virtual address.  Is there
another way?
thanks
Padraig
