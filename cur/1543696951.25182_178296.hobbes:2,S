I could, but a much larger problem is that cups managed to self 
destruct on a reboot, and I now have no printing facility at all, and 
thats more important since I like to print my bank activities for my 
records in case things get out of synch.  However, that shouldn't 
take too much time so here goes.
[root@coyote cups-1.1.20rc6]# dosfsck -v /dev/sda1
dosfsck 2.8 (28 Feb 2001)
dosfsck 2.8, 28 Feb 2001, FAT32, LFN
Boot sector contents:
System ID "        "
Media byte 0xf8 (hard disk)
       512 bytes per logical sector
     16384 bytes per cluster
         1 reserved sector
First FAT starts at byte 512 (sector 1)
         2 FATs, 12 bit entries
      6144 bytes per FAT (= 12 sectors)
Root directory starts at byte 12800 (sector 25)
       256 root directory entries
Data area starts at byte 20992 (sector 41)
      3997 data clusters (65486848 bytes)
32 sectors/track, 8 heads
        55 hidden sectors
    127945 sectors total
Checking for unused clusters.
/dev/sda1: 2 files, 2/3997 clusters
------------------------
The card is now empty, so that looks reasonable to me.  But what do I 
know about a messydos filesystem?  Zilch is what...
