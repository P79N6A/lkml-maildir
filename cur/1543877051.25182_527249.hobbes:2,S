Weird.  I will have to look at that in a little more detail.
Do you know if this problem happens on x86_64?
What does your .config look like?
What does /proc/interrupts look like?
What kind of hardware you running this kernel on?
Can anyone else reproduce this?
The oops clearly shows something using -1 and calling that as an
address I don't know why, but I'm guessing I have triggered a memory
stomp somewhere.  I think this is the first time I have seen a small
negative number causing a NULL pointer dereference.
That patch looks innocuous enough that either:
- I just missed changing something I should have.
- Your configuration has an increase in NR_IRQS and that triggered
  something.
- The patch simply permuted things so a memory stomp now happens
  on the e1000 data structures instead of somewhere else.
- Something doesn't like large irq numbers.
This work is essentially a backport from x86_64 so if your hardware
is 64bit capable testing that should be a fairly easy test, and be
able to rule out large irq numbers as the culprit.
Until I get a good look at -mm I'm going to have a hard time guessing.
But a roving memory stomp is my best guess.
