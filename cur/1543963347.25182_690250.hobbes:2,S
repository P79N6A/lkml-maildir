I think that's one of those "don't do that then" cases ;)

I think x86 (at least) is now using ticket locks, which is fair.  Which 
kernel are you seeing this problem on?

On x86, cpu_relax is just a "pause" instruction ("rep;nop").  We don't 
hook it in paravirt_ops, and while VT/SVM can be used to fault into the 
hypervisor on this instruction, I don't know if kvm actually does so.  
Either way, it wouldn't work for VMI, Xen or lguest.
