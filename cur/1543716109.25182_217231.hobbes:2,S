That's too sensible:  Linux wouldn't be Linux without incomprehensible
messages like:
$ sudo urpmi /home/rzeman/kernel-smp-2.4.25.4mdk-1-1mdk.i586.rpm 
installing /home/rzeman/kernel-smp-2.4.25.4mdk-1-1mdk.i586.rpm

look like there was a problem, the default vmlinuz version is not the same 
of the initrd which mean you have a mdk kernel and not a mdk initrd you may
go in trouble
or doing a menuconfig on a new 2.4.26 kernel and having it nicely tell me
that my choice HAD to be a module, not built in, because it depends upon
something else already selected as a module--without bothering to deign to
say what the dependency was so I had to play grand guessing games.
