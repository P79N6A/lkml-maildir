Both Pavel Machek and I posted test patches to address this... 
basically, because of the design of swsusp, you must copy-n-paste the 
following code into every single kernel thread:
                         if (current->flags & PF_FREEZE)
                                 refrigerator(PF_IOTHREAD);
But I consider suspend untested at best... for reboot and suspend the 
driver should issue flush-cache and other things beyond simply freezing 
the kernel thread.  Further, suspending will suck if the kernel thread 
itself is the one doing I/O on behalf of the driver.  This occurs if the 
transfer mode is PIO rather than DMA.
