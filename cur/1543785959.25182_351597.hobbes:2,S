Subject: [PATCH] Show Mr. SIGKILL some R-E-S-P-E-C-T
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/9/18/154

Here's the scenario (single-threaded, multi-threaded doesn't matter)
# kill -STOP pid
# egrep "^State|^SigPnd|^ShdPnd" /proc/pid/status
State:  T (stopped)
SigPnd: 0000000000000000
ShdPnd: 0000000000000000
The following command sends a signal to the specified thread ID using the
tkill(2) syscall interface
# tkill -ALRM pid (Or any other signal other than SIGCONT or SIGKILL)
# egrep "^State|^SigPnd|^ShdPnd" /proc/pid/status
State:  T (stopped)
SigPnd: 0000000000002000  [ SIGALRM pending ]
ShdPnd: 0000000000000000
# kill -ABRT pid
# egrep "^State|^SigPnd|^ShdPnd" /proc/pid/status
State:  T (stopped)
SigPnd: 0000000000002000  [ SIGALRM pending ]
ShdPnd: 0000000000000020  [ SIGABRT pending ]
# kill -KILL pid
# egrep "^State|^SigPnd|^ShdPnd" /proc/pid/status
State:  T (stopped)
SigPnd: 0000000000002000  [ SIGALRM pending ]
ShdPnd: 0000000000000120  [ SIGABRT and SIGKILL pending ]
EGAD! SIGKILL should have whacked the pid, no matter what.
Here's a patch that fixes this.
Thanks!
