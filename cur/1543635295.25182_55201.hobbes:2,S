That is what it's supposed to do with files. The attached code clearly
shows that it doesn't work with directories. The fsync() instantly
returns, even though there is buffered data still to be written.
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#define NR_WRITES 0x1000
int main()
{
    char foo[0x10000];
    int dirfd, outfd;
    int flags, i;
    outfd = open("/foo", O_WRONLY|O_TRUNC|O_CREAT, 0644);
    dirfd = open("/", O_RDONLY, 0);
    flags = fcntl(dirfd, F_GETFL);
    flags &= ~O_RDONLY;
    flags |= O_RDWR;
    fcntl(dirfd, F_SETFL, flags);
    fprintf(stderr, "Write %d bytes\n", sizeof(foo) * NR_WRITES);
    for(i=0; i< NR_WRITES; i++)
        write(outfd, foo, sizeof(foo));
    fprintf(stderr, "Write complete\n");
    fprintf(stderr, "Sync the directory\n");
    fsync(dirfd);
    fprintf(stderr, "Done, returns immediately!\n");
    close(outfd);
    fprintf(stderr, "Now execute sync and see if your disk is active!\n");
//    unlink("/foo");
}
Again, to assure that file-data is written to storage, one must
execute fsync on files, not directories. The dummy return of 0,
that Linux provides is a database bug waiting to happen.
Cheers,
