do_div() is NOT a 64-bit divide.
It's a 64/32->64+32 div/mod operation, which is a totally different thing
than a full 64/64 divide, and is usually much faster to compute on most 
32-bit architectures.

Because gcc historically _cannot_ generate an efficient 64/32->64 divide. 
It ends up doing a full 64/64 divide thing.
