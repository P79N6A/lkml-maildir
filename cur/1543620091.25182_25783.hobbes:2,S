This is a tough one...  Since there is a typically a single PCI device
for IDE, a PCI or HOST bridge should register an IDE device.  The IDE
device would in turn register two IDE controllers, which would in turn
register up to two disks.

I think one should have a conceptual "system bus" as a virtual parent,
when none is present.  For example my old 486 has PCI, but the only PCI
device is IDE.  There are the standard legacy devices like parallel and
serial, but they do not show up under an ISA bridge device.  This 486
system would be a candidate for this system bus.
