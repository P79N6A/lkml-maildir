well, the most important thing i believe you didnt test: the effect of 
mixing two descriptors on the _same_ selector: one %gs selector value 
loaded and used by glibc, and another %gs selector value loaded and used 
by the kernel, intermixed. It's the mixing that causes the descriptor 
cache reload. (unless i missed some detail about your testcase)
