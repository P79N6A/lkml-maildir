Currently there are just 2 ways to install the freshly build kernel
outside of the source tree: 'make bzlilo' and 'make install'. Both 
call lilo, if the executable can be found. Its good to hear that this
is going to be removed. 
My patch is not for kbuild 2.5, but for the current Makefiles in the
kernel sources. I am eager to check the new features you provide when
kbuild 2.5 or a newer version is included for one of the future kernels, 
but since then I would suggest to consider my patch.
If you have kbuild for 2.4.16 completed, please send me a note. I would
like to try it.

Harri
