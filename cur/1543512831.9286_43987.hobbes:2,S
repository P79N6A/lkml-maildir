Here's the laundry list of requests:
* support for any arbitrary mixer device: name, desc, data types, number
of subchannels
* 3D audio, maybe in userspace
* simultaneous multiple streams, with mixing as needed
* time marking of streams for synchronization
* OSS exposes internals, there should to be a mid-layer lib in userspace
* some control over bass boost and the like
