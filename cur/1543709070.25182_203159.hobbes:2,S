These patches apply with only a few offsets if you apply them like in 
the series file, so there's not much work for either of us in applying 
these patches (unless I need to test without a dependent patch or 
something obvious like that...)

Suffice it to say, 2.6.3 is the begining of week9, and 2.6.3-lofft-mm4vm 
is the end of week9.  The graphs weren't meant to keep secondary 
information like kernel version...

Yeah, I see what you mean.  The code in the lrrd/munin project controls 
what colors come in what order, but I can control what order the info is 
output in...

I'd like for that to be true especially since I rewrote the memory 
plugin for munin to graph as much as was exported to userspace from the 
Linux kernel...
Did I miss anything? ;)
