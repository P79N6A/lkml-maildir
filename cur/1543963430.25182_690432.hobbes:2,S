Cool, I believe this is exactly same thing as we have on DS2760. ACR
counts up and down. For example, if there was a current of 10 uA for
30 minutes, ACR will show 5 uAh. Additional 30 minutes with current
-10 uA will result in 0 uAh in ACR... Right?

Do you have any specs for the ds2765? I'd like to see one, if
it isn't restricted matter. google:ds2765 pdf wasn't helpful...

Just curious.. What does the final value mean and how do you use it?
ACR is the Ah counter. You're subtracting one from another, and that
value will show you.. difference of Ah between T2 and T1..?
You'll get something useful (current) if you divide the value by T2-T1
though... ;-) But I believe OLPC can report current by itself...

This depends. On DS2760 ACR is the only way to determine battery's
"charge" at the given time (thus the capacity in percents, since ds2760
can't report it).
It needs calibration though... ds2760_battery.c doing this: resetting the
ACR to CHARGE_FULL value when battery is in charging state with current
flow < 10 mA.
Works quite good here.

Since you don't seem to use ACR as CHARGE_NOW, I think maybe we indeed
should implement PROP_ACR or better PROP_CHARGE_COUNTER? With units of
uAh... would that work?
