I mean busy inodes after umount doing bogus write_inode_now. Busy inodes 
don't pin the superblock (vfsmnt does but it's gone, otherwise we 
wouldn't be in kill_sb in the first place).
Dave Peterson's fix solves the double free issue, but does potentially 
introduce another busy inode after sb has gone.
