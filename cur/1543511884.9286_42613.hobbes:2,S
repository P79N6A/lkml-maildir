I tried making that symlink soon after I first heard about it, and had
so many problems that I promptly removed it and went back to a static
/etc/mtab instead.
Also, all of the RedHat distributions use a static /etc/mtab out of
the box, and, as far as I'm aware, so do Caldera, Debian and Mandrake.
If so, then your "most systems" is unlikely to be accurate since the
vast majority of systems get installed as designed by the distributor,
and few tweaks of that sort of nature are applied.
Best wishes from Riley.
