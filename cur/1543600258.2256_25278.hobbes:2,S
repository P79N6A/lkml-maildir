Hi,
>o	Are you attempting to access paged RAM?
I am using kmalloc to reserve my memory.
kmalloc as the options GFP_KERNEL and GFP_DMA.
I am not using any command to reserve memory in
the interrupt handler.
>o	Are you accessing anything that sleeps?
Not in the interrupt handler.
>o	Are you enabling interrupts without protecting against
	re-entry first?
I am not sure what do you mean, but I am attaching the interrupt
handler with the function request_irq with the option SA_INTERRUPT &
SA_SHIRQ.
Does the kernel prevent re-entry of the interrupt handler ?
I look in the function schedule :
asmlinkage void schedule(void)
{
	struct schedule_data * sched_data;
	struct task_struct *prev, *next, *p;
	struct list_head *tmp;
	int this_cpu, c;
	if (!current->active_mm) BUG();
need_resched_back:
	prev = current;
	this_cpu = prev->processor;
	if (in_interrupt())
		goto scheduling_in_interrupt;
<...>
scheduling_in_interrupt:
	printk("Scheduling in interrupt\n");
	BUG(); <--------------------------------This is the line 706. -->
This is my problem <--
	return;
}
Do you have any idea how this could happen ?
Thanks,
Jean-François Hammond				.
