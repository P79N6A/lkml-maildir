   Linux doesn't do what Sun (or BSD) does for MS_INVALIDATE.
   The only way to get reasonable benchmark numbers is to have a benchmark
   that has a big enough working set that it doesn't fail over caching.
What we often did before using the MS_INVALIDATE hack was:
	write a file
	unmount the FS
	mount the FS
	read the file.
The unmount frees all the cached pages, but at substantial cost in
benchmark knowledge, privileges, structure, and cooperation with other
processes trying to the the FS at the same time.
