I have a question concerning the amount of memory assigned to a process. We
are using a 2.4 Kernel (SMP). We have a process which is started and tries
to do an MMAP on a 100MByte area. The mmap call fails with MAP_FAILED.
Decreasing the size of the memory requested by mmap to 50 Mbyte works
correctly. It seems as if the mmap call with 100Mbyte exceeds some sort of
memory limit assigned to this process.
The system is physically equipped with 4Gbytes of memory.
Any ideas why this fails?
