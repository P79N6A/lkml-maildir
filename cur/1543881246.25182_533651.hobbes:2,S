No, we ship a udev script.

At one point it looked like it might be possible to drive the tifm_7xx0 
devices in a similar way. I'm not sure if this is actually the case, but 
right now the driver design seems to accurately reflect the reality of 
the hardware design. I don't see any especially strong argument for 
breaking that.
