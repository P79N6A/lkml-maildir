As Ed said, you need the ATA spec to make sense of all that. 
Fortunately, a draft copy is available online at t13.org.  In
particular at 
http://www.t13.org/#Project_drafts
  The docs will
explain the register settings, but not the meanings of the output.
You can avoid the driver is you wish, but it's a really bad idea to do
so since you will change the state of the drive when the driver is not
expecting it.  To safely access the drive from user space, you would
have to make sure the driver is disabled, disable interrupts, and then
poll the controller directly.  The exact method would of course be
controller specific.  You need to look at the ioperm man page and
/dev/port.
Finally, if all you want to do is access the SMART data, you should
look at smartsuite 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/smartsuite/
  or
something similiar.  It already includes much of the vendor specific
information and knows how to get along with the kernel.
