Take a look at the following snippets of earlier patch:  in
hugetlb_reserve_pages(), region_chg() calculates an estimate how many
pages is needed, then calls to hugetlb_acct_memory() to make sure there
are enough pages available, then another call to region_add to confirm
the reservation.  It looks OK to me.
+int hugetlb_acct_memory(long delta)
+{
+	atomic_add(delta, &resv_huge_pages);
+	if (delta > 0 && atomic_read(&resv_huge_pages) >
+			VMACCTPG(hugetlb_total_pages())) {
+		atomic_add(-delta, &resv_huge_pages);
+		return -ENOMEM;
+	}
+	return 0;
+}
+
+static int hugetlb_reserve_pages(struct inode *inode, int from, int to)
+{
+	int ret, chg;
+
+	chg = region_chg(&inode->i_mapping->private_list, from, to);
+	if (chg < 0)
+		return chg;
+	ret = hugetlb_acct_memory(chg);
+	if (ret < 0)
+		return ret;
+	region_add(&inode->i_mapping->private_list, from, to);
+	return 0;
 }
