Hi Guys.
I'm setting up a machine for a friend, and I've got a weird problem.
On a motherboard ( and old M571 I think )  with a Cyrix 686L processor I
can't boot any of the recent series of kernels. When booting, I get the
loading Linux and tye uncpressing stage, but it then locks solid. It
looks like the bzimage problem that was around a good long while ago,
however I CAN boot 2.2.15 which is also a bzImage. I've tried compiling
the kernels as i386, as well as 586, and I've also tried the debian
dstrbution kernels ( it's debian unstable, by the way ).
Anybody got any ideas?
Chers,
Eamonn
