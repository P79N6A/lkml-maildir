User unmount unfortunately still doesn't work if the kernel doesn't have 
the unprivileged mount support but as we discussed this in last July that 
shouldn't be needed for this case.
  % mount -t ntfs-3g /dev/hda10 /tmp/test
  % cat /proc/mounts | grep /tmp/test                                                                         
  /dev/hda10 /tmp/test fuseblk rw,nosuid,nodev,user_id=501,group_id=501,allow_other 0 0
  % mount | grep /tmp/test
  /dev/hda10 on /tmp/test type fuseblk (rw,nosuid,nodev,allow_other,blksize=1024,user=szaka)
  % umount /tmp/test
  umount: /dev/hda10: not mounted
  umount: /tmp/test: must be superuser to umount
  umount: /dev/hda10: not mounted
  umount: /tmp/test: must be superuser to umount
