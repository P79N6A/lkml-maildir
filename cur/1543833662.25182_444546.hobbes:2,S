To recap, the driver code _is_ that symmetric, it's just the implementation
that's asymmetric.  That is, {en,dis}able_irq() are two separate routines,
while {en,dis}able_irq_wake() are just wrap set_irq_wake().
I'll forward this patch to the the ARM kernel list, to help avoid surprises.
There aren't many in-tree drivers using these calls.
