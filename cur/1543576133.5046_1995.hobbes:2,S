It's this patch that changes things for you:
o       E820 memory detect backport from 2.4            (Michael Chen)
The E820 memory detection parses a list from the BIOS, which specifies
the amount of memory, holes, reserved regions, ...
Apparently, your BIOS does not do it completely correctly; otherwise you
should have had crashes before ...
