It has _slight_ change of being dangerous and is just in violation of
the protocol.  No real data corruption case reported yet tho.  Till now
most drives which report such problems had stinky NCQ implementation
anyway - slow, buggy, blacklisted in the other OS, etc...  I'll submit a
patch to blacklist the drive.
