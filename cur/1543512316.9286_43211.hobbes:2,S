Subject: locking question: do_mmap(), do_munmap()

which semaphores/spinlocks protect do_mmap() and do_munmap()?
do_mmap():
	I wrote a test patch, and I found out that some (all?) callers call
lock_kernel(), but that mm->mmap_sem is _NOT ACQUIRED_. Eg
sys_uselib()-> do_load_elf_??() -> do_mmap().
do_munmap():
???? I think here is a race:
sys_munmap() doesn't call lock_kernel(), it only acquires mm->mmap_sem.
do_mmap() internally calls do_munmap(), ie with the kernel lock, but
without mm->mmap_sem.
What about adding debugging runtime checks to these function?
ie #defines which call down_trylock() and spin_trylock() and oops on
missing locks?
We could define them to "(void)0" before 2.4.
