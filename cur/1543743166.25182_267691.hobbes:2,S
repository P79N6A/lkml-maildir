I see what you mean. You could be correct that it would model cache
behaviour better to just have the last N freed "hot" pages in LIFO
order on the list, and allocate cold pages from the other end of it.
You still don't want cold freeing to pollute this list, *but* you do
want to still batch up cold freeing to amortise the buddy's lock
aquisition.
You could do that with just one list, if you gave cold pages a small
extra allowance to batch freeing if the list is full.

I think you want to still take them off the cold end. Taking a
really cache hot page and having it invalidated is worse than
having some cachelines out of your combined pool of hot pages
pushed out when you heat the cold page.
