On x86-64 it can be almost totally different (by restoring a hibernation image
we replace the entire contents of RAM with almost no constraints).
[Well, using a relocatable kernel for restoring an image with nonrelocatable one
or vice versa is rather not the best idea, but everything else should work in
theory.]
On i386 the boot kernel is still required to be the same as the one in the
image.
