 Agreed about this example because the change is mechanical and can almost
be done by an automaton.

 As I wrote, no big concern about it from my side and it looks I will be 
changing more of the file anyway. ;-)

 Oh come on -- that's just common sense.  If something is good, there is
no point in discarding it without thinking, just because it is a part of a
bigger entity that we consider bad.  I consider it good not because it is
a part of the GNU standard, but because I have concluded that it is and it
is pure coincidence ;-) I have taken it from the said standard.  But as I
said, this is a minor nit here and I can resist from adding extraneous
spaces in pieces of code you are interested in as long as I am able to
track which ones they actually are.

 I had no problems with writing code checkpatch.pl would swallow without a
blink even before it existed.  It does not mean I should follow the
surrounding mess if this is what the state of code is.

 Fine with me, no problem.

 Your concern is valid and this is why I proposed the split.  My point
being, unlike the rest of the MIPS arch tree these days the Broadcom bits
are only touched from time to time by two or three people (myself
included), so it is much easier to coordinate changes if they are limited 
to this subarch.  Which means stripping out changes needed elsewhere from 
the i2c patch itself can only improve things.
> BTW, SWARM seems to be only one of the 4 SiByte platforms we support.
 I think nobody really knows for sure how many Broadcom/SiByte platforms 
we support at the moment. ;-)  I am fairly sure there is some interest in 
the BigSur, SWARM and Sentosa only.

 Well, arch/mips/sibyte/swarm/ is included for all the three above as well 
as a couple of other I may not necessarily be sure what they are even.  So 
this should be of no concern.
 BTW, do you mean i2c_add_numbered_adapter() will fail if no devices have
been declared to exist on the given bus with i2c_register_board_info()?  
That sounds strange...  Note in all cases there are EEPROMs (onboard ones
as well as optionally SPD ones) on both buses on Broadcom/SiByte boards
and they are handled by a legacy client driver.  The Broadcom SOC is
actually capable to bootstrap from one of these EEPROMs (rather than form
the usual system parallel Flash ROM).
