To continue this point; on my desktop I have root/var/tmp/vicepa-on- 
LVM-on-RAID5, boot-on-RAID1, and swap-on-RAID1, so I would easily  
overflow the default SMP dmesg buffer size in messages well before  
syslogd/bootlogd got started.  I finally ended up having to increment  
the default by 3 in order to have the boot messages still available  
after booting.  It would be nice if we could quiet down some of the  
more excessively verbose kernel messages, there's a lot of mostly- 
irrelevant spew that chews up log buffer space.
