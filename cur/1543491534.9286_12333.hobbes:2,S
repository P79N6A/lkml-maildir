Subject: bug in NCR5380.c scsi driver - no sti() :)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hello gurus!
After reading the list archive I found that there is folk
using dtc3181e cards (like I want to) but that the driver does not
behave as it should.
Comparing code from 2.0.33 and 2.2.4 I see that sti()
became restore_flags() and hence the interrupts are _never_ enabled inside
NCR5380_main() 8-|
It means that despite all tricks with USLEEP the system is paralized while
accessing scsi. Even the date does not advance :)
I hope somebody who *knows* what he is doing can fix it (I'll make it
work for me but I may miss something and create race windows... - please, 
the real fix for all of us)
Please cc: me, otherwise I'll browse the archive anyway.
Regards,
