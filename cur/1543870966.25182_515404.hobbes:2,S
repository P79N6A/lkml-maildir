OK, what about the patch below?

This patch:
- adds the missing dependency of ROMFS_FS on BLOCK || MTD
- disallows the illegal ROMFS_FS=y, MTD=m, ROMFS_ON_MTD=y
- ensures that at least one of ROMFS_ON_BLOCK and ROMFS_ON_MTD is always 
  enabled:
  - automatically enable ROMFS_ON_MTD if BLOCK=n
  - automatically enable ROMFS_ON_BLOCK if ROMFS_ON_MTD=n
- if EMBEDDED=n, ROMFS_ON_BLOCK is always enabled
  - the "(which may have been disabled)" that could now confuse
    users has therefore been removed from the help text
