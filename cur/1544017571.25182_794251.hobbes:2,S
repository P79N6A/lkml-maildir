It ought not to, but it seems that is the case where you
saw the original corruptions, so hmmm...
Actually, I see, the myri10ge driver does put up to
64 bytes of the initial packet into the linear area.
If the IPV4 + TCP headers are less than this, you will
hit the corruption case even with the myri10ge driver.
So everything checks out.

Upon recent review I think jumbo frames in such drivers should
actually be fine.
