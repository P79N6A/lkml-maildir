OK, I'll check them out. Maybe they did patch them somewhere... But if
such a patch exist I think it should be for quite some time in the
mainstream, because this is quite a critical kernel bug, that it
crashes down.

Unfortunately the SysRQ does not respond. I've tried that to reboot,
shutdown, etc the system after the crash. There is simply no response.
I've tried even compiling into the kernel some really abstract
drivers, just in case I forgot something. I've managed once even a
2.5MB kernel image ;) unfortunately it got stuck just like the rest.
Thanks again, I'll write something more through the weekend, maybe I
will solve this... at least I hope so.
