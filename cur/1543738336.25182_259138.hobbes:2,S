Subject: [BUG]  oom killer not triggering in 2.6.9-rc3
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I have an Xserve running 2.6.9-rc3 and patched to run the ppc kernel rather than 
the ppc64 kernel.  It's configured with 2GB of memory, no swap.
If I run one instance of the following program, it allocates all but about 3MB 
of memory, and the memory hog spins with 100% of the cpu.
If I run two instances of the program, the machine locks up, doesn't respond to 
pings, and is basically dead to the world.
Shouldn't the oom-killer be kicking in?

#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#define PAGES 1000
#define BLOCKSIZE (pgsz * PAGES)
int main()
{
	int pgsz = sysconf(_SC_PAGESIZE);
	while(1) {
		char *p = (char *)malloc(BLOCKSIZE);
		if (p)
			for (int i=0;i<PAGES;i++)
				*(p+(i*pgsz)) = 1;
	}
	return 0;
}
