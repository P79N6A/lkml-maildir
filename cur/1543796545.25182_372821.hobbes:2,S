Subject: [PATCH 0/3] Replace driver_data with dev_[gs]et_drvdata()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/12/5/5

This patch-set replaces (of those found): 
  target = dev->driver_data;
    with
  target = dev_get_drvdata(dev);
  dev->driver_data = target;
    with
  dev_set_drvdata(dev, target);
The net's and rest's patched files are compiled with no error (or warning regarding to the patch).
s390 is not compiled but checked several times and should not have any problems.
Any comment is dearly welcome ;)
