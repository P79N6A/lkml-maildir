Here it is. All sparc32 updates.
Most critical here are the HyperSPARC and sun4d updates as they get
things booting that weren't before, though neither fixes things all
the way. Another pretty nasty failure-to-boot issue that brings down
distro kernels is also resolved with Jurij Smakov's initrd memcpy() fix.
The main purpose of all this is so that sparc32 hackers and users can
see what's in and what isn't so they can complain about the fixes that
didn't get in and then I can include those when they remind me.
