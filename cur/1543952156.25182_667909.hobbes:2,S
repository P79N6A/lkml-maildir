You should carefully check the the SYN-ACK received by the client has a
correct checksum ("cksum OK" in tcpdump output). It would be possible
that for some reason, something on the network randomly corrupts it.
Also, you say you have netfilter with conntrack. Is this on the client ?
If so, you should try disabling it to rule out any possible bug in the
connection tracking.
