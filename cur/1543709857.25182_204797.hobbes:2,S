No, nothing at compile time, at least WRT the threads issue.  There is a 
completely different problem with backtracing through an interrupt or trap.  I 
have sent the patch for that which makes only minimal changes to code (one line 
I think, and that an asm line).  The rest is a dwarft2 set of code to build the 
frame description for the trap/interrupt frame.
