        FYI, within handhelds.org kernel project, we also saw the need
for consistent ADC infrastructure, and developed such, based on
classdev concept, on todo to be submitted for review. Our
API/userspace interface however optimized for individual (or
fixed-batch) readings over stream operations, our target usage
are touchscreen, battery, hwmon drivers.
