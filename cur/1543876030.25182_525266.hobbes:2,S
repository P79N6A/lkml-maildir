Hi Matt!
	Actually, it refers to the next field.  To give complete context:
	/*
	 * The extra 1 is there because the CPU will access an
	 * additional byte beyond the end of the IO permission
	 * bitmap. The extra byte must be all 1 bits, and must
	 * be within the limit.
	 */
	unsigned long	io_bitmap[IO_BITMAP_LONGS + 1];
Cheers,
Rusty.
