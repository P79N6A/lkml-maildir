Hi.  I am not getting good results on a box I have which uses an Intel
Pro gigabit Ethernet driver for its network connection.  What happens
is that I get messages like watchdog xmit timeout and lots of errors
out of ifconfig.  Here is the listpci entry for that card.  It works
under the other OS, so I imagine the hardware is OK.
0000:01:0b.0 Ethernet controller: Intel Corp. 82540EM Gigabit Ethernet Controller (rev 02)
        Subsystem: Intel Corp.: Unknown device 3013

        Memory at e7020000 (64-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=64K]
        I/O ports at b400 [size=64]

        Capabilities: [e4] PCI-X non-bridge device.

Any assistance would be appreciated.
