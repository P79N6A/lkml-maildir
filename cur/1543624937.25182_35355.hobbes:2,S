They are not supported for user space, but used in private mappings
for kernel text and direct memory mappings. Generic code never sees them.
That will hopefully change eventually because 2M pages are a bit help for
a lot of applications that are limited by TLB thrashing, but needs some 
thinking on how to avoid the fragmentation trap (e.g. I'm considering
to add a highmem zone again just for that and use rmap with targetted
physical freeing to allocating them)

There are global pages which are normally not flushed over context switch.
That is used for all kernel mappings. 
There is also some optimization in the CPU that tries to do a selective
flush only when you reload CR3, but as far as I can see doesn't help
for the Linux context switch. It only works around broken TLB flushing
algorithms in some Windows version.
