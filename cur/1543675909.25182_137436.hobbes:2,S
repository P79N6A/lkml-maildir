From what I read when SCO had more on their web site, it's more a
question of contract violation. IBM had a contract for their Unix, and
developed their code for that.  Then IBM ported some of their "own"
kernel mods that was written for AIX and released it into Linux for
free.  That violated some portion of the Unix contract. Thus, if IBM
wins, could have implications against some parts of GPL, and maybe
that is why Microsoft is backing SCO.
I may be way off base, but SCO always stated it was contract issues
and not code or copyright.
