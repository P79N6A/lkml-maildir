Hi,
Thanks for the details.
I wish to know which application access which file, when.. etc etc. I would like to create a log of that. I am unable to write this log to the file from within the kernel. I would not like to go to the user level programs. I am doing this from within the kernel, as I would like to know exactly when things are being done.
Regards,
Sumit
