yes, we do test that too. (we added this recently)

the existing 32-bit and 64-bit defconfigs should be enough for that. For 
better/full coverage, randconfig should be used.

at least on x86 subarchitectures are not at all that important (they are 
a rather inflexible build-time concept), and as you have seen it in this 
thread, we are working on reducing their count. 99% of the real hardware 
is covered under the generic subarchitecture.
they are more important on other (mostly embedded) platforms, with ARM 
having 75 defconfigs.
