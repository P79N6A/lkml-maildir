Hello,
it's been quite a while that I noticed that any ordinary user, not
just root, can type "dmesg" to see the kernel ring buffer.
My question now is: Why? I often saw things in the kernel ring buffer
which I don't want every user to know (e.g. some telephone numbers with
ISDN).
Are there any problems in just letting root get the contents of the
kernel ring buffer?
