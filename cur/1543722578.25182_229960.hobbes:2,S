I guess that S3 sleep might find them usefull, too.
Perhaps calling them disable_nonboot_cpus() and enable_nonboot_cpus()
are better names?

__save_processor_state() is needed from smp.c, save_processor_state()
is needed from swsusp.S. I did not want to break that for now.

I hand-edited the diff and forgot to kill this, sorry. Nothing should
be missing.
