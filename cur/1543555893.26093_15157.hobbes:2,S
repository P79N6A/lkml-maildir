Alan, here's the DMI info you requested.  Sorry about the delay.
The BIOS listed is a new test BIOS that has a *corrected* APM that I
received this morning.  I really want to take a second to thank the
people at Compal (BizCom) for the short turnaround once we figured out
who the right people were to talk to.
Once I get the OK from Compal (and finish testing), I'll post it to the
Tuxtops support site for all to download.
