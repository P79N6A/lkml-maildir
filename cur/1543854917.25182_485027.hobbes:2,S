Yes, that's expected.  The event if for the queue, not directed to a 
specific thread.
If in future we want to think about preferably waking a specific thread 
we can then think about it.  But I doubt that'll be beneficial.  The 
thread specific part in the signal handling is only used to implement 
the SIGEV_THREAD notification.
