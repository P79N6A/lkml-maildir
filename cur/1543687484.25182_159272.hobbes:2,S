I managed to stabilize my Board, but I don't think the trick was obvious: 
Disable alle APIC related kernel Options (Local APIC and IO-APIC), disable 
APIC Mode in the BIOS. Check on reboot if it still talks about the APIC in 
the boot messages (How? IIRC mine did, which was why I did not think that 
disabling the APIC helped... Actually somehow it still was activated. Could 
ACPI be part of this?). If it does try noapic and/or nolapic boot options.
If you completely shut off the APIC it runs stable, but 1 of the 3 USB 
Controllers is not assigned an interrupt. All this with ACPI enabled (ACPI 
patch 20030730 and kernel 2.6.0-test3).
