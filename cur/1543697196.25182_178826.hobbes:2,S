Is this in "plain" test9 as well? can't find any reference to either
bogomips or to cpu_khz in any scheduler-related code in
2.6.0-test9-bk-as-of-yesterday.

cpu_khz is done during init_tsc. The code is basically:
unsigned long eax=0, edx=1000, tsc_quotient;
tsc_quotient = calibrate_tsc();
if (tsc_quotient) {
	__asm__("divl %2" 
	:"=a" (cpu_khz), "=d" (edx)
	:"r" (tsc_quotient),
	"0" (eax), "1" (edx));
}
cpu_khz is only available (so far) if the TSC or HPET time sources are used,
and not when the PIT time source is used. So the scheduler tweak should have 
some sort of fall-back mechanism anyway, IMHO.
As for the bogomips question: I see different bogomips values for 
	tsc (~1.200)
	pit (~600) 
and	pmtmr (~8)
on my 600 MHz PIII Coppermine.
