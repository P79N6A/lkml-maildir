Well, how do you want to win the whole game? Modules are just one part of 
it, what about the rest? If I'd be that much concerned about modules, I 
would disable module loading completely.

Only a minority of people do cross compile kernels, most people compile 
kernel and modules on the same machine, so that there enough points left 
to attack the system. Even if the kernel is compiled on a different 
machine, how can you trust the kernel you're going to boot next time?
I'm missing how this does fit into the big picture, throwing lots of 
code onto modules doesn't make it more safe. In the meantime there are 
simpler measures to get the system more secure.
bye, Roman
