I think I have seen special live-cd distribution for KDE beta testers. 
Kernel is not a KDE but such a very broken distribution with -rc kernel 
could be more easily maintained than "udev forever!". Live-cd (or 
live-usb) wouldn't be too flexible - you can't say there "can you give a 
whirl to this patch, please" but I bet you will have more testers.
