Hi, Ingo
For the option PREEMPT_RT, local communication latency is very very big,
it is about 30 to 50 times as big as the option PREEMPT_NONE as far as
local ping latency is concerned. Obviously, this should be fixed ASAP.
This patch fixes this bug by changing netif_rx to netif_rx_ni in
loopback device driver.
