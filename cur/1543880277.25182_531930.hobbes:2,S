Sounds interesting. Kind of like the completion approach, but with the
dangerous bits outside the module.

I think that wording is a bit too strong. Of course, if the device is
unregistered in the exit routine, the module must make sure it gave up
all references it itself obtained. However, it doesn't have any control
about who obtained a reference during the object's lifetime. If an
outsider holds on to a reference, we'll lock up until this reference
has been given up (but I guess this is what we want).

Couldn't this waiting be made simpler?
- add completion to kobject in kobject_unregister_wait()
- call kobject_put(), then wait_for_completion()
- in kobject_cleanup(), save completion from kobject, call release
function, then complete() on saved completion
I'll toy with this a bit.
