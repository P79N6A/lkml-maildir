Yes, there is this "is_exported" call, but his can be moved completely 
into "module_get_kallsym" and have the "type" returned be already upper 
/ lower case.
That, together with filling the module name "module_get_kallsym()" would 
make the returned "struct module *" unneeded.
Since kallsyms is the only caller of that function, we can change its 
interface to not return a "struct module *" at all, and return just an 
integer that means "symbol found" or "no more symbols".
I'm still volunteering to do that patch, but you seem more active than 
me at the moment...
