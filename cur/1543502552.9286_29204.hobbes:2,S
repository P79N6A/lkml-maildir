Hello folks,
with "make menuconfig" a Tekram SCSI Card 390 is not supported.
The problem is that 
CONFIG_SCSI_NCR53C8XX_NVRAM_DETECT=y
is not configurable by make menuconfig. (it was in 2.0.36)
drivers/scsi/README.ncr53x8 lead me to the solution.
I had to edit .config, added the line above. Thereafter the "can not mount
root fs" message does not appear, the SCSI driver is loaded as suggested
and everything works fine. As I am not a programmer, i am not able to fix
this myself. Hope its small work to one of you. 
Thank you all for supporting one of the bes OS, I've ever worked with.
look at this:
