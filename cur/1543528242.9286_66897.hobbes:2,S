Alan,
One place I looked was in the MAINTAINERS file.  I think the kernel itself
is worth an entry or two in there.  I probably have your email a bit
wrong, since it seems like you use a number of different ones in there.
This seems like the right place to look, and it might help (bozos like me) 
in future.
Dave
