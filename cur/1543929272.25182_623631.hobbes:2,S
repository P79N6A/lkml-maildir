Please pardon me for jumping in; I am not a kernel developer, but I try
to help with debugging whenever I can (and it's not just hand-waving, I
helped to track down a couple of nasty bugs on MMC or ACPI EC,
recently). And I am an engineer and IANAL, so I wouldn't speak about
laws here. But I think it's not just a distribution's problem.
Unfortunately, I need VMware and ndiswrapper to get work done with my
laptop. It's not the perfect world, but the only alternative is to boot
in XP. So I normally stick with vendors kernels and, when I have time to
"play" with new kernel, I go for it. If ndiswrapper and VMware work,
perfect, I can test extensively the new kernel; if I find problems, I
*know* I have to restart without proprietary modules, try to reproduce,
report back. I did it a lot of times.
What I think is that every time VMware or (worst) ndiswrapper breaks,
the kernel loose an awful lot of testers. In the span of time before
Giri and the VMware team post a patch (-rc1 and -rc4, tipically), my
testing activity is just occasional. And I guess a lot of people is in
the same situation. 
These are just my 2cents. I will continue to test new kernels every time
I can, and to use native solutions as often as I can (go, ath5k, go!;
and LabWindows/CVI for Linux, anyone?). But maybe a bit of tolerance can
help everyone...
Back in my hole,
