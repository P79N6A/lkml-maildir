OK. Though I don't know when Marcelo and I will be on the same
timezone again (for some reasons his days don't seem to take
24 hours ;)).

It should be ok to apply that patch anyway. When we _do_ figure
out which of the two options we should take we'll send you an
incremental patch. Until then we can just leave the "xxx/3" thing
