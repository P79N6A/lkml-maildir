I prefer defining "__nodeinit" for __cpuinit and __meminit case to
__devinit.   __devinit is used many devices like I/O, and it is
useful for many desktop users. But, cpu/memory hotpluggable box
is very rare. And it should be in init section for many people.
This kind of issue is caused by initialization of pgdat/zone.
I think __nodeinit is enough and desirable.
Bye.
