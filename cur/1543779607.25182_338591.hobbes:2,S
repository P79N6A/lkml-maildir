I have been trying to modify open-iscsi to use the exisitng
kobject_uevent code similar to how we tried to do this with the old
sfnet driver. Basically there are two problems. As Dimtry described
above, open-iscsi pushes a lot of iSCSI command processing to userspace.
And to accomplish this it must send at least this struct (or a one
similar) to userspace to be processed.
struct iscsi_hdr {
        uint8_t         opcode;
        uint8_t         flags;          /* Final bit */
        uint8_t         rsvd2[2];
        uint8_t         hlength;        /* AHSs total length */
        uint8_t         dlength[3];     /* Data length */
        uint8_t         lun[8];
        __be32          itt;            /* Initiator Task Tag */
        __be32          ttt;            /* Target Task Tag */
        __be32          statsn;
        __be32          exp_statsn;
        uint8_t         other[16];
};
There could also be data as part of the command too thought (like how a
SCSI read or write command has the cdb part and the payload).
For the iscsi_hdr we could encode the values of the fields into strings
and send it back and forth between userspace and the kernel using sysfs
to get the comamnd into the kernel and modifed kobject_uevent functions
(kobject_uevent would need to be modified to be able to take this extra
header info instead of just doing add, remove, etc that are predefined
uevents). This starts to get ulgy though and when you consider that we
still have some payload that also needs to go to userspace it gets uglier.
Also for the sysfs value per file rule, breaking up the iSCSI command
header into a file per field to pass commands into the kernel then using
a binary sysfs file for the data part of the command, and then
reassembling all this in the driver is not so nice. A major advantage
open-iscsi has over sfnet was that it was simple to send all the session
info for session creation and setup and iSCSI command info through a
netlink message.
