Actually, don't they do this -already-?  I thought I saw somewhere on here
recently that there was a class of functions you could use in a module for
'one-off' activities.  I suspect that covers 90% of what could be paged
out (the remainder being mostly the unloading process, for non-hotswap
modules).  But IANAKG. (..not a kernel guru).

I mis-typed - by 'major rewrite' I meant more an analysis and tagging
process, which would have to touch most of the kernel before it was
useful. But again, IANAKG so the existing swap code may already handle
that, at least in a way that it could be a ruleset (with override tags?)
instead of having to put a new set of tags everywhere.
