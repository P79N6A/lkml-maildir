I had lumpy-reclaim in my todo-queue but it seems to have gone away.  I
think I need a lumpy-reclaim resend, please.

"as much as possible" won't suffice, I suspect.  If there's any chance at
all that a non-moveable page can land in a hot-unpluggable region then
there will be failure scenarios.  Easy-to-hit ones, I suspect.

Yup.

yup.

I don't even remember what that looks like.

hm.
I'm not saying that we need to do memory hot-unplug immediately.  But the
overlaps between this and anti-frag and lumpiness are sufficient that I do
think that we need to work out how we'll implement hot-unplug, so we don't
screw ourselves up later on.
