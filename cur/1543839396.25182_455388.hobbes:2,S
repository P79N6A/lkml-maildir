powerpc's section size is 16Mbytes. so table itself is bigger than cacheline.
And powerpc doesn't have DISCONTIG configuration.

In early days of implementing SPARSEMEM,  I tried vmem_map + SPARSEMEM.
But it was very complicated.....so it was dropped.
Before retrying, I think performance/profile test with each memory model should
be done.
Considering ia64, an advantage of SPARSEMEM is (just?) memory hotplug.
If people need extreme performance, they can select DISCONTIGMEM.
But powerpc(NUMA) people has only SPARSEMEM. So test on powerpc will be 
necessary, anyway.(of course, they doesn't have vmem_map)
