I don't know what arch you're using, but I work with ARM7TDMI, which has a 
behavior I believe can be found documented in some obscure .pdf from arm.com:
Unaligned accesses wrap.
If you have this:
[mem.] 00 01 02 03  04 05 06 07
[data] 00 11 22 33  44 55 66 77
in little-endian mode,
*(int*)0x00 == 0x33221100
*(int*)0x01 == 0x00332211
*(int*)0x02 == 0x11003322
*(int*)0x03 == 0x22110033
*(int*)0x04 == 0x77665544
At least, that's how ARM's docs seem to describe it. I work with this cpu 
embedded in a microcontroller (AT91M40800), and these values result:
*(int*)0x00 == 0x33221100
*(int*)0x01 == 0x33221100
*(int*)0x02 == 0x33221100
*(int*)0x03 == 0x33221100
*(int*)0x04 == 0x77665544
An unaligned access to an assembly-declared variable caused me much grief 
once, overwriting the task scheduler's ready-to-run list under certain 
conditions...
The moral of the story:
RISC cpus abhor unaligned accesses.
