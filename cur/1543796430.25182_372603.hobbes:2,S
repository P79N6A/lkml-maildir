The skills barrier has _nothing_ to do with the release cycles.
And if you want to get a driver into the main tree, that isn't being
maintained, just get a piece of the hardware to a kernel developer,
along with the driver and it will be maintained.  I know I've made that
offer many times in the past, and so has others.
