ok. Those also fall into the category of "I personally don't care" :^)

In defense of the HW designers, Dino operates extremely well
in the environment it was designed for. Principally, workstations
with HP graphics cards (which only use MMIO). Optimizations for
graphics make it one of the fastest PCI-1X (and Cujo is PCI-2X)
HBA's - that's according to a 3rd party graphics card vendor who
has ported to the major high-end platforms.

Yup. *sigh*.  Between chip bugs, tradeoffs of performance, time to market,
and simple programming interface, things got pretty ugly (its the
old saying about "Pick any two").
