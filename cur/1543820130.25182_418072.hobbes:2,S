Two things:
   1. You don't get to create such a link unless you have an unconfined
      (trusted) shell or you have a policy that says you get to create
      such a link, and
   2. You don't have permission to execute /tmp/evilstty at all, unless
      you have an unconfined (trusted) shell.
This is a really basic misunderstanding of AppArmor. All unconfined
processes are considered trusted, so attacks that suppose an unconfined
user did something very evil/stupid are not interesting. An AppArmor
policy is supposed to prevent the attacker from ever obtaining control
of an unconfined process, so just assuming that you have one doesn't
demonstrate breaking the model.
