"Bug in sched.c 683!i" or 863 (?)
this was the message on the console.
Im using 2.4-test6 and this is the way how to get the bug:
1. on boot type in the lilo loader
---
    test init=/bin/sh
    this drops you in the shell instead of "init".
2.  Then type "exit".
--- You get on the concole "Aiehh kill init" or something.
3.  Then press
---
     CTRL+ALT+ENT
    and you get
Bug in sched.c 863! (or 683?)
regards,
Martin
