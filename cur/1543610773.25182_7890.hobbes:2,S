You may need to do some custom work to get them to play well together,
this is true of any double or Triple patched kernel.  I frequently patch
with 2 sometimes 3 different patches (one less now that ext3 is in the
kernel!) and find that it sometimes takes a little looking around in the
diffs to make sure that the patches do not conflict.  But it can be done.
I have not looked at these specific patches however.
