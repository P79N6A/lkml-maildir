Hmmm. That shows that whatever is connected is connected okay.

That's what I'd try --for a start.

Well most all the devices are virtual. Some ethernet drivers handle
multiple configurations as multiple devices, others do not. I'm
just guessing since I do not use the SIS900 module here.
What I see from the source is that the HomePNA is set because
the board reported a certain identification, 0x6b90. Now, that
doesn't mean too much because a further reading of the source shows....
"If no one link is on, select PHY whose types is HOME as default." sic
So, I would guess, that MAYBE you booted your machine without the
cable connected to your hub and that's why it defaulted to HomePNA?
Anyway, `rmmod sis900;ifconfig eth0 192.168.0.4 etc...` to remove and
reinstall to see if that fixes it...
Cheers,
