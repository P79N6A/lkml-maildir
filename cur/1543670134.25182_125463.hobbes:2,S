CCed Pat, as this is his territory.
Hm yeah, this will fix the problem.  But is there anyway we can do this
without a lock at all?  I think we wouldn't need the lock, if we didn't
test the refcount for > 0, right?  Pat, that just keeps us from getting
a reference count on a kobject that hasn't been initialized, right?
That is a good idea to do, but is it really necessary?
If only atomic_inc_return() was defined for all platforms we might be
able to do the following, dropping the lock entirely:
struct kobject * kobject_get(struct kobject * kobj)
{
	struct kobject * ret = kobj;
	if (kobj)
		if (atomic_inc_return(kobj->refcount) <= 1) {
			atomic_dec(kobj->refcount);
			ret = NULL;
		}
	else
		ret = NULL;
	return ret;
}
void kobject_put(struct kobject * kobj)
{
	if (!atomic_dec(&kobj->refcount))
		return;
	kobject_cleanup(kobj);
}
Or am I missing something?
Anyone know how to whip up a atomic_inc_return() for the platforms
missing it?
thanks,
greg k-h
