The SN# is garbage in the ID block, I don't know why this is occurring
with our drives.  I am going to forward this note to our program lead
for that product to see if he's aware of the issue.  Unfortunately, if
the utility zone configuration is corrupt, I am not sure anything can
be done in the field to fix it... the drives might require an RMA. =/
