So I have been taught as well.  Merriam-Webster says:
The word you've entered isn't in the dictionary. Click on a spelling
suggestion below or try again using the search bar above.
Suggestions for journalled:
     1. journalese             2. journalized
     3. journalize             4. journals
     5. journalizer            6. journeyed
     7. journal                8. journal box
     9. Journalist            10. julienned
    11. junketed              12. generally
    13. generals              14. journaleses
    15. Journalism            16. General
    17. gillnetted            18. gingered
    19. journalizes           20. gendered
I'd suggest using neither M-W or OED as sole references and accept
spellings from both.  Past experience has shown me that this is one
area where there will *never* be consensus.
