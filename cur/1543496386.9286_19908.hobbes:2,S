A meta-bitmap where each bitmap block is represented by a bit in the
meta-bitmap would solve this.
A 0 in the meta-bitmap means the bitmap block is assumed to be "all
unallocated" whatever the actual disk contents.  A 1 in the meta-bitmap
means to use the bitmap block contents.
Then any operation which clears many whole bitmap blocks can simply
clear meta-bitmap bits.
I don't know how this would impact reliability in the case of a system
crash + e2fsck.
