I'm unconvinced as to why collie needs an ifdef in there and looking at
what I think you're leading to, its ugly. Perhaps you could change the 2
to a variable set by the machine instead or something, depending upon
your intention.
Rather than post these patches straight to the patch system, perhaps you
could also post them for discussion first as discussing them once
they're submitted seems wrong (and we have to remember to remove the
patch system from the cc).
