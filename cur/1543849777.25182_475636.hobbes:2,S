Hi Martin, they indicate that you're getting transmit hangs.  Means
your hardware is having issues with some of the buffers it is being
handed.  Because the TDH and TDT noted below are not equal, it means
the hardware is hung processing buffers that the driver gave to it.
We need the standard bug report particulars, lspci -vv, cat
/proc/interrupts, dmesg, ethtool -e eth0, and maybe output of
dmidecode, etc.  I'm pretty sure you know the drill.

only a little.  There are so many different pieces of e1000 hardware
and so few specifics in this report that I'll be able to tell you lots
more when you get us the info requested.
