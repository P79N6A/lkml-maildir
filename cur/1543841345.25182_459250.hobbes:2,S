The resource we are controlling is CPU bandwidth, what other parameters can we
use to control it?. Nice values indirectly control the time a task gets, but
also affects its priority. Even if a task is not CPU bound, we are only
interested in its CPU bandwidth utilization in the CPU resource controller.

The problem with controlling nice values that I see is that nice values do not
necessarily linearly map CPU time. Changing the nice value also changes the
priority, which impacts the order in which tasks are run.
It's my belief that time and priorities are orthogonal. Nice does a good job
of trying to mix the two,  but in the case of resource management it might not
be such a good idea.
