thanks.
For this case, though, I want to align on cacheline bounaries even on 
UP, right?  That's why I picked ____cacheline_aligned.  It uses 
L1_CACHE_BYTES when !CONFIG_SMP.  Other uses of ____cacheline_aligned in 
the kernel seem to relate to irq matters, just like my groupings in tg3.h.
[obviously benchmarking can answer some of this, but I want to hammer 
out silliness first]
