True, that would work.  It would require the addition of another mount 
option though, so I wonder, is that really needed?  What problem with 
the current patch would this solve?  Is there really a need to save real 
ids to the disk with the current uid option and no force?  Keep in mind 
that udf is meant for removable media where the uids aren't going to 
make any sense in another system.
Maybe I'm just being lazy though... I'll dig back into it and try to 
submit a new patch with the force option by this weekend.
