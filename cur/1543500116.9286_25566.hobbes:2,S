I think by labelling some development branch versions as suitable for use
by adventurous users the 'beta' goal could be achieved.  'Suitable,'
meaning unlikely to cause permanent damage to your system.  This would
also have the added benefit of giving wider testing in the development
branch, without having to maintain three codebases.  Interesting idea
though.  We may see the objective of getting fresher code into the hands
of the adventurous happening anyway with the soon-ish release of 2.4.
imho,
