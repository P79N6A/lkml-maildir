FYI,
This ended up being a non complete fix. Day after these two patches 
(11-12) I submitted two other patches to complete this fix series (got 
bitten by release-early-release-often, fixed day-after-submission 
thoughts in those two later patches). For some reason these two keep 
floating around as separate ones from those two later ones.
To make things even more complicated, eb7bdad82e8 (see stable-2.6.22) 
could have been split more logically to do_lost addition and 
FLAG_SND_UNA_ADVANCED parts (but that didn't occur to me back then).
All of them listed here (from stable-2.6.22 since one of them is
reduced from mainline version):
