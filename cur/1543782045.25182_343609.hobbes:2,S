Right now you only have microsecond timing. Although printk() gets
"nanosecond" resolution from sched_clock() it throws away the low
order bits when it outputs the ".%06lu ... nanosec_rem/1000"

I'm just trying to assess how much work is needed at the moment. Both
you and Andrew have come up with scenarios where higher than jiffies
resolution is needed ... so it seems unlikely that I'll be allowed
to do much damage here.  Andrew's proposed:
 __attribute__((weak)) unsigned long long printk_clock(void)
patch would provide the hooks I need.
