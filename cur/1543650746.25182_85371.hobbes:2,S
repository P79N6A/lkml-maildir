The compiler at function entry cannot know anything about the scope of 
objects above the return address. It could equally be a valid pointer to
data above the stack with a global context created by a thread library.
I'm curious if the optimisation is actually legal

You removed the comma in the patch above its gone from IGNLABEL foo, to
IGNLABEL foo. I don't see where your comma is coming back from.
Otherwise I've no problem (although maybe IGNLABEL("HmacRxAccepted")
would be neater since it conveniently lets people put them back.
