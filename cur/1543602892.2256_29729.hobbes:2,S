I didn't realize that the header was also used in user-space.  I would
still use the le32_to_cpu() style macros in the code, but only define
macros of your own if the kernel ones were not defined, using either
#ifndef __KERNEL__ or #ifndef le32_to_cpu, or both.
This way, you get the benefit of the fast asm-based instructions in
the kernel, and you only use the slow ones in user-space (mkcramfs)
where you don't really care.
Cheers, Andreas
