I'm not sure how seriously anyone ought to take what I'm about to
outline. Please feel free to treat it with as much or as little
reverence as you choose.
How to implement SELinux starting from Smack.
You'll need to break up the current rwxa accesses into a set
that matches the current SELinux set. Assign each a letter and
a "MAY_ACTION" #define.
You'll need a mapping for domain transitions, something like:
     subject-label program-label new-subject-label
This will require bprm hooks that aren't there now.
Additional hooks will need to be filled out as Smack does not
add access control to things that aren't objects or actions that
aren't accesses. Treat these as if they are accesses to objects
and there shouldn't be too much trouble.
Do something about the linear search for subject/object label pairs.
With the larger label set searching will become an issue.
Audit integration, too. The networking code will require some work
for ipsec. The interfaces are pretty clean, Smack isn't using it
because the CIPSO interface is simpler, not because there's any
real problem with it.
I wouldn't expect the whole thing to be more than a couple week's
work for someone who really wanted to do it.
