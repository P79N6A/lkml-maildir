This IS ok. You just need to read the definition of the 'F' tag:
F: Files and directories with wildcard patterns.
   A trailing slash includes all files and subdirectory files.
        F:      drivers/net/    all files in and below drivers/net
        F:      drivers/net/*   all files in drivers/net, but not below
        F:      */net/*         all files in "any top level directory"/net
   One pattern per line.  Multiple F: lines acceptable.
This tag just includes Kconfig and Makefile.
