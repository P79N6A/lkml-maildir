Well, that's a different story.  If the plan changes so that we decide 
to produce a high-end card, then we can do an ASIC, giving us more chip 
area and faster clock speeds.
The problem is that a $300 card isn't a card "for the masses".  My 
example there is only plausible for those cases where lots of money is 
already being spent.
