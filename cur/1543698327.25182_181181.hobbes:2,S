There are several other problem reports which start to smell like md/raid.

There's one (by Alan Buxey) that I attributed to PREEMPT which happens on
UP with ext3 and raid0:
	md: Autodetecting RAID arrays.
	md: autorun ...
	md: considering hdd1 ...
	md:  adding hdd1 ...
	md:  adding hda1 ...
	md: created md0
	md: bind<hda1>
	md: bind<hdd1>
	md: running: <hdd1><hda1>
	raid1: raid set md0 active with 2 out of 2 mirrors
	md: ... autorun DONE.
and that one shows strange memory corruption problems too.
NOTE! The fact that it only happens with PREEMPT for some people is not
necessarily a sign of preempt-only trouble: while PREEMPT should really be
equivalent to SMP-safe, but there are some things that are much more
likely with preemption than with normal SMP.
In particular, preempt will cause every single (final) unlock to check
whether there is something else runnable with a higher priority, so it
opens up races a lot - if you touch something just outside (in particular:
_after_) the locked region, preempt is much more likely to show a race
that on SMP might be just a few instructions long.
