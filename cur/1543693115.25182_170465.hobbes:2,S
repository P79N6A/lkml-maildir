Just earlier today (about 8 hours ago, as it happens) I spotted
duplication at  noos.fr's  qmail system.  I have no real idea of
why it happens, but as it happens with ALL their subscription
addresses, my first order measure I revoked all of their subscriptions.
I did also notify them.

I have seen this same STYLE of qmail-triplets in duplications all
around, and for couple weeks (at least) now.
It definitely has begun to smell like rotten piece of filter code
that has gotten wider use over last couple weeks.
The basic screwup is violation of:
    One shall NEVER use visible "To:" and "Cc:" in message routing.
(and related:  "sendmail -t"  is root of all evil, and should never
have been invented...)
