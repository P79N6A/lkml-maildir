That 1 in 2**32 is the chance of duplicating any specific number in the
sequence.  The chances of *some* member of the sequence being a duplicate
is much higher.  This is called the "birthday paradox" because if you
pick ~30 people at random, it is highly likely that two of them will
have the same birthday.
