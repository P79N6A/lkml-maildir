I have made a patchset to add 'NUMA node handling support' to
your patchset.  If a container that is identical to NUMA node is
hotplugged, this handles NUMA related stuffs.  For instance,
creating/deleting sysfs directories and files of node, data structures,
and etc...
  - numa_hp_base.patch
  - numa_hp_ia64.patch
  - acpi_numa_hp.patch
  - container_for_numa.patch
Status: Tested on 2.6.9-rc2 including your patchset posted earlier.
Thanks,
Keiichiro Tokunaga
