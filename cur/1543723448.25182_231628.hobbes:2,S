Periodically fsync() the logs so there isn't soooo much stuff to
write. In fact, a simple sync() call about once every few seconds
should make everything work, i.e. ...
main()
{
    for(;;)
    {
        sync();
        sleep(3);
    }
}
... in another task should fix it. We no longer have `update` running
like the old unixes. Now there is bdflush that cares only about
kernel buffers getting in short supply. If you want your files to
be sync(ed) quickly, you need to keep the in-kernel buffers short
which means you need to do it yourself.
Before everybody chimes in.... just try it. You'll probably like it.
Cheers,
