Hi, Ingo:
I just disabled the affinity mask and reran the test. There were no 
significant changes for two threads (barrier overhead is around 9 
microseconds). As for 8 threads, the barrier overhead actually drops a 
little, which is good. Let me know whether I can be any help. Thank you 
very much.
