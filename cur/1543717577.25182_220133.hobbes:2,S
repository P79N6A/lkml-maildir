Sorry, I wasn't suggesting that kexec should be done that way _now_.
I don't think it's nearly as simple as just adding an entry point in
the DSO.  For example, how would strace be affected by the new entry
points?  The syscall entry path probably would have to be almost
duplicated to do a syscall-number-free entry.  What about syscall
restarting?  Would VDSO entry points work with statically linked
binaries? etc.
Perhaps Uli has answers to all of these, but no matter how you do it,
it'd be a pretty dramatic shift in how applications interact with the
kernel.
