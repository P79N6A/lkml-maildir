Looks fine to me.

I'd prefer to keep it in nmi.c -- it doesn't really have any relevance
elsewhere. I made a macro of it so that I wouldn't need any #ifdef:s
or long explanations in the code proper.
There is one thing which bothers me. Look at the end of the NMI handler:

This becomes a series of loads and tests. Ideally, a _single_ test should suffice
to inform the NMI handler whether we're in NMI_LOCAL_APIC mode or not. One problem
is that we aren't resetting nmi_watchdog to NMI_NONE if we fail to detect or
initialise the local APIC; if we did, we could kill the cpu_has_apic test.
... however, nmi_perfctr_msr could serve this purpose since it will be
non-zero if and only if (cpu_has_apic && nmi_watchdog == NMI_LOCAL_APIC).
So I would actually suggest something like:
	if (nmi_perfctr_msr)
		wrmsr(nmi_perfctr_msr, -(cpu_khz/HZ*1000), -1);
