None of the 2.4.1-ac patches hit drivers/pci/Makefile.  You have
corrupted your source somewhere.  Building from 2.4.1-pristine +
patch-2.4.1-ac10.bz2 gives this in drivers/pci/Makefile.
names.o: names.c devlist.h classlist.h
devlist.h classlist.h: pci.ids gen-devlist
	./gen-devlist <pci.ids
gen-devlist: gen-devlist.c
	$(HOSTCC) $(HOSTCFLAGS) -o gen-devlist gen-devlist.c
