That is one of the reasons that crash dumps are useful.  Quite a few 
problems that customers hit are not easy to reproduce, but when they 
provide a dump file that can be loaded into gdb with the original 
kernel debugging info and the backtrace command issued and various 
bits of internal structures examined, usually a good hypothesis can 
be made for the cause.  Feed that back into a code audit and you end 
up fixing problems that are decidedly challenging.
