Ah, that depends on whether they provided the source code for download
to paying customers at the time those customers downloaded the binary.
GPL section 3:
   If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
   access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
   access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
   distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
   compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
What this means is that if you make the source code available
alongside the binary, e.g. on a web site under the same conditions of
access, you don't need to provide the written offer to all 3rd
parties; indeed, you don't need to provide the written offer at all.
The above description of what Crossmeta did doesn't clearly say if
Crossmeta provided their customers with the binary and an offer to get
source on request (the written offer), or if those paying customers
were able to download the source at the same time as the binaries.
