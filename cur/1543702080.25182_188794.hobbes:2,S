It was jiffies_64 in the first place (that's why the function is called
get_jiffies_64(), after all). 
I once made it jiffies because jiffies was volatile while jiffies_64 was
not. Now that jiffies_64 becomes volatile as well, I thought we could
re-straighten things.
But we can leave out this chunk, it really shouldn't make any difference.
