Took a look at this and atm compiling a sparc tool-chain to try it out.
What about moving the check added by rmk to kallsyms.c?
This would remove the extra pass on vmlinux which is for no use for
most people anyway. On the other hand an error could go unpassed
because we (for now) do not do the kallsyms stuff if not configured in.
We could make the kallsyms run independent on the configuration, but
only link in the symbols if required to do so.
This would also allow us to have architecture specific final-linking
rules in one place if sparc needs special rules.
Today kallsyms already knows about 'SDA_BASE*_' only valid for ppc.
wli - can you post the output of a failing sparc compile?
