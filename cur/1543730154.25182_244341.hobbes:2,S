In normal conditions, when NAT translates an IP header, it should do correct
checksumming. However; when the source IP address of a packet is
manipulated, Iptables still seems to use the "original" IP address and
calculate the checksum accordingly. This way even if I use 3 three boxes;
Original Packet --> NAT 1 --> NAT 2 --> NAT3 --> Still incorrect checksum
The wrong checksum is carried over and over the line. It is really a strange
issue and I could not find a reason why still I get the incorrect checksum
even after the IP header is translated three times...
As I said, the original packet must be corrected before it is transmitted to
another place and I think it is just two or three lines of code in the
kernel, but the question is "where"...

I'm surprised to find that there doesn't seem to
be an ebtables mangle table. That'd be the place
to match on a u32, then either change that or just
mark the packet for checksuming.
