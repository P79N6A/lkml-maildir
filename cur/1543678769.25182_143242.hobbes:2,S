For me, it didn't even finish negotiating the connection:
Jun 24 22:37:48 turing-police pppd[1144]: Using interface ppp0
Jun 24 22:37:48 turing-police pppd[1144]: Connect: ppp0 <--> /dev/ttyS14
Jun 24 22:37:49 turing-police pppd[1144]: sent [LCP ConfReq id=0x1 <asyncmap 0x0> <magic 0x9ed88e38> <pcomp> <accomp>]
Jun 24 22:37:49 turing-police pppd[1144]: Modem hangup
Jun 24 22:37:49 turing-police pppd[1144]: Connection terminated.
I'm assuming the netdevice was there when it said 'Using interface'.  It was
certainly gone by the time I was able to do ifconfig or 'ip link show' or
anything like that.  ismail reports "several  minutes" - I'm wondering it the
bug is in pskb_may_pull()  being handed an oodd packet-of-death that I receive
during startup but ismail gets later on.  There's comments in the patch about
making sure the decompressor is linear, but in my case the LCP stuff isn't even
negotiating compression.  Uninitialized variable?
