In Ottawa you told me this driver really works on ia32 only, so a dependency on
X86 would probably be OK.
However, when grepping through the various defconfigs, it's enabled on ia64 and
ppc (common, pmac, and default), and not on ia32:
| anakin$ find -name "*defconfig*" -type f | xargs grep SCSI_AIC7XXX_OLD  | grep -v 'not set'
| ./arch/ia64/defconfig:CONFIG_SCSI_AIC7XXX_OLD=y
| ./arch/ppc/configs/common_defconfig:CONFIG_SCSI_AIC7XXX_OLD=m
| ./arch/ppc/configs/pmac_defconfig:CONFIG_SCSI_AIC7XXX_OLD=m
| ./arch/ppc/defconfig:CONFIG_SCSI_AIC7XXX_OLD=m
So should I make it depend on X86 || PPC || IA64 instead?
