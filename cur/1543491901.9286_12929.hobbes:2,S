2.2.5
I've got a similar problem with an ISA/VBA board, AMD486DX4/100.
I built the Kernel to support the RS232 console interface. I wonder
if it needs the serial port signals in the correct position to work.
BTW, I have a VGA card in because I'm not done rebuilding the
system.

I'm going to see if attaching a terminal (PC) to the serial port helps
and I'll check the BIOS for the settings (I may have no video selected).
The console terminal was needed on AT&T 3B2's so maybe they emulated
that.
