Dear Sir,
  I am an undergraduate student, I want to read the code of Linux-kernel.After
struggled for several weeks,although I learn a lot and understood somethings in
the kernel,but I realize my poor knowledge in C programming and system,but I 
have write some assemble program in protected mode and really know a little of 
8x86, So I want to get some free books about C(especially about the mutiprogramming of C and Assembling-Lan) and how system calls and linux kernel
work.How can I get them ,Can somebody help me?
