Sorry about this, but I grabbed the wrong "ps ux" line.  I followed up
with the real zombie:
ml267      290  0.1  0.0  5128    0 ?    DW   Oct10  2:18 [enlightenment]
I was just merrily doing regular tasks: cruising the net with a netscape,
over ssh, and chatting with people on a BBS, and suddenly my window
manager stopped responding.
I tried to close it, but it refused to respond, then I tried all the
different kill signals, and none of them helped.  With no other choice, I
hit Ctrl-Alt-Bksp.  I successfully broke out of X, but after that, I found
that the zombie is now a child of init in the ps tree.
