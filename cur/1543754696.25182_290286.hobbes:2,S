ext3 resize is like file_fsync() --- it's an ioctl, so there's a
guaranteed open file at that point.
But while the resize code originally used lock_super() to protect from
races against allocation/deallocation, the ordering fixes in it means
that that's all safe anyway now.  The lock_super() is currently only
really used to guard against two threads doing resize at the same time,
and if it's a problem, it would be trivial to use a different lock.
