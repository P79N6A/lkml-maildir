OK, I see what you mean.  This would be a problem if:
- the VGA BIOS leaves the protected bit set
- the user enables vertical recalculation
- the size crosses a multiple of 256
It is a bug (ported from the assembly) and fortunately quite easy to
fix.  I don't know why I missed this when I looked before.
