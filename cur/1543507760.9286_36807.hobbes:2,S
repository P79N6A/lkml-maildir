   this patch against 2.3.16 should fix the SMP race:

   I removed also the atomic_dec/inc since they are useless.
Maybe a better idea is to sleep until we can obtain the buffer locked
ourselves, this %100 guarentees that ll_rw_block will not do anything
with the buffer.
On the otherhand, I cannot convince myself that your change is safe
and %100 fixes the race and also does not create new ones.
