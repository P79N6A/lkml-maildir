Hmm I thought it was a feature not a bug or I would have already
reported something ;)
What I need is to set the frequency to around 400mhz when on battery,
but that's not any of the speedstep frequencies, the speedstep
frequencies are too fast (750/1200mhz) or too slow (250mhz). Is it
supposed to work that way?
thanks,
Andrea
