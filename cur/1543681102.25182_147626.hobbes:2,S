As an aside, I really like sendfile's semantics except for
* People occasionally want to add a receivefile(2).  I disagree... 
sendfile(2) interface should be really be considered a universal 
"fdcopy" interface, regardless of what the 'to' and 'from' file 
descriptors are attached to.  File to socket.  Socket to file.  File to 
file.  socket to socket.  All should be supported, even if the fallback 
is a stupid (but small!) in-kernel copy loop.
* Copy-until-EOF semantics are either undefined, or, unclear to me 
personally.
