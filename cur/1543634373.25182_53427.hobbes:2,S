cvs -d :ext:FOO@cvs.gkernel.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/gkernel co ext3
The branches being used are
	cvs up -r ext3-1_0-branch	# HEAD of ext3 development
	cvs up -r features-branch	# For htree, ACLs etc
and there are a couple of other branches I use for tracking merges into
Linus's and the -ac trees.  The htree stuff is all that's new in the
features-branch right now.
Cheers,
 Stephen
