This has absolutely nothing to do with the audio driver.
Linux is having trouble with your PCI IRQ routing table that is
presented by your BIOS to Linux.
Can you provide 'dmesg -s 16384' output, after changing line 7 of
arch/i386/kernel/pci-i386.h thusly:
-#undef DEBUG
+#define DEBUG 1
This will show me your PCI IRQ routing table.
