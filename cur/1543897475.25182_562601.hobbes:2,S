I don't remember when it happened, but I do remember that I suddenly
had to manually disable dmix to stop it messing around with my sound.
I don't need it, and I certainly don't like libraries doing random IPC
behind my back.

Those sound daemons were around long before ALSA was even conceived.

That sounds like a minor glitch that should be easily remedied if you
file a proper bug report.  Have you tried?

Shoddy hardware.  Don't blame the drivers for that.

Yes, API and configuration file syntax aside, the ALSA developers are
always friendly and responsive.

I've still not, after all these years, managed to figure out what KDE
(or Gnome) is supposed to be good for.  I'm not missing anything from
my window manager, xterm and xemacs setup.
