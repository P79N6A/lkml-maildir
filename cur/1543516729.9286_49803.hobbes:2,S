I don't think they disappeared.
Yes, it is still obsolete. See packet (7). SOCK_PACKET is evil because
it requires libpcap to know about every possible link layer, with
(PF_PACKET,SOCK_DGRAM) the kernel handles this abstraction. Alexey
Kuznetsov's libpcap/tcpdump patches (ftp.inr.ac.ru:/ip-routing/lbl-tools) 
fix it. 
They are e.g. used in the newest version of the SuSE tcpdump. 
In the long run applying them (modulo the small nits like reversing the
meaning of -p) will b ea good idea, because it'll save you a 
lot of work as tcpdump maintainer.
