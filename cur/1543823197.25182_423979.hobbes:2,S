I would be for remove, but apparently we have one or two users in
IBM that run their x440s (32bit only) with CONFIG_NUMA. No distributions
do so though and I would expect x440s to usually run distributions
because they are quite expensive machines.
My arguments for remove:
- The code is very hackish - it was written before the proper ACPI
infrastructure is in place - and NUMA on 32bit in general needs a lot
of hacks because of the limited ZONE_NORMAL.
- NUMA on 32bit is kind of broken by design.
- It isn't used much.
- It breaks often
- It tends to not work on Opterons and hits the users who try it there.
Short of remove I would settle on the panic on non Summit.
Also if you only wanted NUMA emulation for testing it could be also
done much much simpler removing near all of i386/*/srat.c. But with
the inherent 32bit NUMA limitations I have my doubts on its great
usefulness.
