So put the modules there as well or put a ramdisk there that does module 
verifying and loading (and disable module loading after that).
Again, why is this patch necessary? I have to repeat my main point from 
the last mail: If someone could show me how I can trust the running 
kernel, it should be rather easy to extend the same measures to modules 
without the need for this patch.
Show me a way that this is not possible and I'll agree with you that this 
patch is needed.
bye, Roman
