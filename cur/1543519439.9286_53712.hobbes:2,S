If the cache controller snoops memory accesses (including DMA) from the 
system BUS and agrees with the memory/bus controller for performing 
cache line write-back when a dirty cache line is hit, ordering is as
expected.

No problem there. A driver should normally expect IO/MMIO accesses to
follow strong ordering, but should insert explicit memory barrier for
STOREs to memory to be observed in order from the BUS each time it is
needed. OTOH, having reads from memory passing writes when possible should
not make problems.

When actual data transfer uses BUS mastering, the number of IOs/MMIOs is
generally small. I would prefer to be safe rather than to spare a couple
of micro-seconds, since ordering problems have very weird effects.

Indeed I am interested.
Thanks for the info,
