Ouch, right.

Ok, this is pretty similar to the way I implemented this for tmpfs. The
problem is that the union mount code is explicitly checking if the filesystem
is supporting whiteout. I used to use a new filesystem flag (FS_WHITEOUT) for
this but thought that disk filesystem like ext2/3/4 will have problem with
that if you mount an old image. So I guess I still need a feature flag.

At the moment I still rely on this for the current readdir implementation.
Viro already said that he doesn't want to see this (the readdir changes) in
the kernel but in userspace.
Thanks,
