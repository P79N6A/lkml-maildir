Ok. My experience isn't all that great so I may well be missing something
here. But what?
1. email -> sendmail
2. sendmail figures out what it has to do with it. turns out it's deliver
it locally for user blah
3. sendmail starts procmail so that it delivers the email.
4. procmail goes through the recepie list for user blah and eventually
delivers the email (one way or another)
Now, in order for step 4 to be done safely, procmail should be running
as the user it's meant to deliver the mail for. for this to happen
sendmail needs to start it as that user in step 3 and to do that it
needs extra privs, above and beyond that of a normal user.
Now as I said, I'm not a UNIX God[tm] and so I may well be missing something
vital. If so, what is it? This sounds like something that would be way
useful to learn. :)
