Subject: [PATCH 2/3] cxacru: Poll for device status more frequently.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/1/30/325

The device is only polled for status every 5 seconds yet status updates occur as often as every second - when the line is down the status changes between "down" and "attempting to activate" every 2 seconds.
