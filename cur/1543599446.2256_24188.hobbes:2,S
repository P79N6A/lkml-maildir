The mount format changed when we added NFSv3. The new format is
backward compatible, but we still print out a message in order to
ensure people get the combination NFS + mount correct.

No. The default should still be the same. I changed the latter last in
the 2.4.0 pre series. You can check what the actual value is using
'/proc/mounts'.

You're probably seeing fragments disappearing. UDP has no mechanism
detect this, so when it happens, the RPC layer first has to time out
and then resend the entire request. In TCP connections, only the
missing fragment needs to be resent.
Now as to the reason why fragments are disappearing, I suggest you
look at your network layout and try to measure (with the aid of a
packet sniffer such as tcpdump) on which segment the loss is occuring.
