I'm not disagreeing with that.  It's just that you are looping all
struct devices that are attached to a struct usb_device and assuming
that they are all of type struct usb_interface.  And that's not true
anymore, and should never have been assumed (which is probably my fault
way long ago when converting USB to the driver model.)
We probably need to keep our own list of interfaces if we want to
properly walk them now...
And we also need to be able to handle devices in the device tree that do
not have a suspend/resume function, or ones that are not attached to any
bus, without failing the suspend, as obviously they do not care or need
to worry about the whole issue.
thanks,
