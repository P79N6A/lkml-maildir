I just noticed the same problem. After about ten minutes, it seems
like all the ACPI events got 'unstuck' -- my screen's backlight went
up and down a couple of times (and battery/AC indicator flipped a
couple of times) responding to previous power loss and gain events, I
think, and the fans dropped down from high speed to low.
I was chalking it up to another charming bug on my HP nx6125, but if
someone else is seeing it too...
I'm on Ubuntu, x86_64, and git as of a couple days ago as well. I
haven't tried reverting the patch.
