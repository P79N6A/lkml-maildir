Thus, choice of 'cpu_hotplug_disable' and 'cpu_hotplug_enable'
was determined on the basis of its purpose, as in *what* it does 
as opposed to *how* it does it. :)
The name is not much of a concern. I just didn't feel all that 
comfortable with lock_cpu_hotplug because locks are usually 
used to safeguard the data,while here we are trying to
maintain the *state* of the system.
