The hard drive is only 80GB and the ReiserFS file system is on
paritition 1 which spans the entire hard drive.
I recently upgraded to kernel 2.6.22.1.  Previously was running 2.4.31
and never encountered this error before.
I'm presently trying to make it fail again to see if I can gather more
information.  I can also revert to a previous kernel release (either
2.4.x or 2.6.x), any suggestion?
