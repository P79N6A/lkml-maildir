There is only one user of shared libaries today, thats Kconfig.
And Kconfig is the only user of C++ as well.
There is quite a lot of added complexity in Makefile.lib + Makefile.build
only to support this. Being the one that introduced it, I would like to
see it go away again.
Rationale behind this is that the current added complexity has an penalty
when compiling a kernel, and I would like to move the complexity to
the only user.
Care to try that approach?
