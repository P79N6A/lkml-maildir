Sometimes, if you get a nice person from Maxtor on the phone, you can 
get it RMA'd anyway.  You just have to talk to the right person.  If you 
don't get someone willing to help out, try calling back until you get 
someone else.  I was able to return a drive that was 3 months out of 
warranty.  Yours is a bit more out of date, but you might as well give 
it a shot ;)
