 config space. You should use the values in the pci_dev structure as they might
 have been remapped by the kernel.
 
+   You still need to use the check_region(), request_region() and
+release_region() routines for PCI I/O space and check_mem_region(),
+request_mem_region() and release_mem_region() for PCI memory space.
+
+   Once you have the regions allocated, you use ioremap() to create
+a cookie, passing in the proper base_address[] from the struct pci_dev.
+This cookie is passed to the readb(), readw(), readl(), writeb(), 
+writew(), and writel() routines when accessing PCI space. You must
+always use these routines when accessing PCI space from the kernel.
+Not all architechures allow memory-mapped access to PCI memory from
+the kernel.
+
+   DMA device drivers should review the IO-mapping.txt file for
+information about converting between the various address spaces.
+
+   PCI interrupt routines are always SA_SHIRQ and should use the
+(struct pci_dev *) dev->irq field for the interrupt number passed
+into request_irq().
