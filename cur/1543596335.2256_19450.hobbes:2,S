I would rather see this code removed from libgcc and put into a
function (optionally inline) such that code like:
__u64 foo(__u64 a, __u64 b)
{
        __u64 t;
        t = a * SOME_CONST + b;
        return t / BLEM;
}
would really look like:
__64 foo(__u64 a, __u64 b)
{
        __u64 t;
        t = 64b_mul(a, SOME_CONST) + b;
        return 64b_udiv(t, BLEM);
}
such that for peopel to use 64-bit operations on the kernel, they have
to explicity code them in, not just accidentialyl change a variable
type and have gcc/libgcc hide this fact from them.
Note, I use __u64 not "long long" as I'm not 100% "long long" will
mean 64-bits on all future architectures (it would be cool, for
example, if it was 128-bit on some!).
What do you think? Would you accept patches for either of these?
