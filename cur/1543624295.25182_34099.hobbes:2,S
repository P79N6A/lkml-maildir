What if the command is perfectly documented, but only for a certain class
of IBM disks?
Are you going to create a table of every disk out there, along with every
command it can do?
Remember: the kernel driver is a driver for the host controller, yet the
command is for the _disk_. It makes no sense to check for disk commands in
a host controller driver - they are two different things.
It's like checking for icmp messages in a network driver. Do you seriously
propose having network drivers check icmp messages for command validity?
