Let me put my though police hat for a short while...
BITFIELDS ARE EVIL !!!
Especially when mapping things like HW registers... I know the p/iSeries
code is full of them, I'd strongly recommend getting rid of them.
The compiler is perfectly free, afaik, to re-order them, you have no
guarantee of your actual layout, and it's not portable (I know nothing
but PPC uses those drivers _right_ now, but still...)
So please, don't add more ;)
Ben.
