Subject: 2.2.19: config help text about "TCO timer"

Hi,
I know I'm late, but Configure.help in 2.2.19 says:
..."The TCO (Total Cost of Ownership) timer is a watchdog"...
I know TCO meaning that, but I can't believe it for a mainboard 
component. Should the user then throw the PC away, or what? Or is it 
more safe to reboot frequently. What has this to do with costs?
Confused,
Ulrich
