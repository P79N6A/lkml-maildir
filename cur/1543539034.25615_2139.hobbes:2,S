(or, "if at first you do succeed, try and try again")
As some people will recall, I posted a message a while ago about excessive
files being remade when in fact not much had changed.  I've finally solved
the mistery!
It is to do with the way my kernels get built by my buildscripts.  They
effectively do (each one of these lines can be selected via options to
the buildscripts):
	(other usual make stuff)
	make linuxsubdirs
	make zImage SUBDIRS=
	make modules
However, when linuxsubdirs is run, linux/include/version.h is not up to date.
When zImage happens, it gets updated, and then the modules get built, at which
point, modules.h then gets a new timestamp.
Next time around, files that depend on either modules.h or version.h get
rebuilt, dispite actually being up to date.
Here is a patch which fixes this, so that we can be sure that version.h is
up to date with any changes before we build any files:
