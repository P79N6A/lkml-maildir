Subject: Re: [PATCH] updated reiser4 - reduced cpu usage for writes by writing more than 4k at a time (has implications for generic write code and eventually for the IO layer)

I should add, you execute a lot more than 4k worth of instructions for
each of these 4k writes, thus performance is non-optimal.  This is why
bios exist in the kernel, because the io layer has a similar problem
when you send it only 4k at a time (of executing a lot more than 4k of
instructions per io submission).The way the io layer handles bios is not
as clean as it could be though, Nate can say more on that.
