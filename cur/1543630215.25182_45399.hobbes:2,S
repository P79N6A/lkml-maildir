Clearing out the pending folder once again.
I cheated a little this time, and took a bunch of pending items from
Linus' bitkeeper tree in a vain hope to cut down merging time later.
This also drops a few 'stagnant' items from my tree as well as those
mentioned further down the changelog.
As usual,..
Patch against 2.5.15 vanilla is available from:
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/davej/patches/2.5/
Merged patch archive: 
http://www.codemonkey.org.uk/patches/merged/
Check 
http://www.codemonkey.org.uk/Linux-2.5.html
 before reporting
known bugs that are also in mainline.
