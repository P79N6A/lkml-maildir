Here is a patch against 2.5.67, can you try it out?
I did not compile let alone run with this patch.
We never hold the host_lock while calling the detect function (unlike the
io_request_lock, see the bizzare 2.4 code), so acquiring it inside
ppa_detect is very wrong. I don't know why your scsi scan did not hang.
