official == same as in the docs and vendor driver :-)

I believe that they are correct - please see explanations below.

It is used for debugging purposes by PDC202XX_DEBUG_DRIVE_INFO
(it prints old/new content of drive configuration registers).
I think that I'll cover it by #if PDC202XX_DEBUG_DRIVE_INFO to make
the aforementioned fact clear and to optimize non-debug case a bit...

Probably chipset snoops WIN_SETFEATURES (w/ SETFEATURES_XFER subcommand)
and sets the appropriate timings internally.  It might be possible to drop
the timing setup completely for UDMA modes but the vendor driver actually
does it so I left it alone for now.

The calculations are done in a different way so we get the correct timings:
 7 cycles (== 210 ns) are used for active time
16 cycles (== 480 ns) are used for cycle time
These timings are the maximum possible ones using MB[2:0] and MC[3:0]
(please refer to the comments in the code to see how MB/MC map to TB/TC).

MB[2:0] and MC[3:0] are for MWDMA/UDMA timings only
(it is impossible to set SWDMA0/1 timings using them).
I suppose that PA[3:0] and PB[4:0] (PIO timings) should be used for SWDMA.

Fixing SWDMA was not a goal of my changes (my patch is already quite
overloaded) but I would happily welcome the incremental patch doing it.
[ I'm also aware that it may difficult without docs so it still on my
  personal TODO if nobody beats my to it earlier. ]
Thanks,
Bart
