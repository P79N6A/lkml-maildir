Nah, I agree with DaveJ -- there are definitely "dev" portions when it 
comes to driver updates.
Judging from recent posting from Bart, it looks like he has an evil plot 
to merge the IDE driver with libata.  libata will also eventually 
[perhaps with Bart's changes?] make the SCSI portion optional, as I have 
long promised.  And it's getting other new and destabilizing features.
There will be other changes in SCSI and block too, which want staging... 
  Some of the stuff I've been putting off until "2.7" will be re-thought 
into something that appears in the on-going 2.6 series.
If you don't have driver stability, you don't have a useful kernel...
