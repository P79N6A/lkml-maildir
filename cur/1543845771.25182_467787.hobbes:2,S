Subject: git sometimes stripping one path component in commit mails

	Hi,
I noticed git sometimes strips one path component from the filenames in the
patches mailed to the git-commits mailing lists. This causes problems when
piping these mails through diffstat.
Here is a part of an actual mail received through
git-commits-head@vger.kernel.org to demonstrate this issue:
Is this a current git bug, or a bug in the version used for those mailing
lists?
