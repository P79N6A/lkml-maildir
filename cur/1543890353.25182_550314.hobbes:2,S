Lag is the deviation of a task's allocated CPU time from the CPU time
it would be granted by the ideal fair scheduling algorithm (generalized
processor sharing; take the limit of RR with per-task timeslices
proportional to load weight as the scale factor approaches zero).
Negative lag reflects receipt of excess CPU time. A close-to-canonical
"fairness metric" is the maximum of the absolute values of the lags of
all the tasks on the system. The "signed minimax pseudonorm" is the
largest lag without taking absolute values; it's a term I devised ad
hoc to describe the proposed algorithm.

This comment does not apply. Generalized processor sharing expresses
preferential treatment via weighting. Various other forms of
preferential treatment require more elaborate idealized models.

Regardless of the underlying accounting, I've presented a coherent
algorithm. It may be that there's no demonstrable problem to solve.
On the other hand, if there really is a question as to how to load
balance in the presence of tasks pinned to cpus, I just answered it.

Yes, the mechanism I described takes that approach.

There was a second issue raised to which I responded. I didn't stray
per se. I addressed a second topic in the post.
