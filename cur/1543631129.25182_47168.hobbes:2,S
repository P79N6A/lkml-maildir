I was of course, completely wrong about this, that #ifdef doesn't cover
the whole of <asm/system.h>. 
Some of the stuff outside that ifdef will never work in a userspace
app anyway (like wbinvd). Looking at it, is there anything there at all
that we should let userspace be seeing, or should that #ifdef cover
the whole file ?
