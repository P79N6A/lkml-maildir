Perhaps, but calls are expensive. Repeated calls down stacked block
devices will add up. In only the most unusually cases will there
be a need to allocate more than one top-level BIO. So the savings
for most cases requiring splitting will just be a single BIO. The
other BIOs will still need to be allocated and populated, but it
would just happen outside the block devices. The savings of doing
repeated calls vs allocating a single BIO is not obvious to me.

Yup.

Yes it would.

In 2.5.7, Jens allows the BIO vectors to hold upto 256
pages, so it would seem that larger than 64k IOs are
planned.

Not really trying to create any limitations, just trying
to balance what I think could be a performance concern.
