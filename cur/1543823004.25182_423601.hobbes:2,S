Subject: [PATCH] mem-leak fix for acpi_thermal_write_trip_points()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

There's a memory leak in
 drivers/acpi/thermal.c::acpi_thermal_write_trip_points()
found by the Coverity checker as bug #1243
The problem is simply that if the allocation of 'active' fails, then we'll
return from the function without freeing the memory previously allocated 
to 'limit_string'.
One fix would have been the insertion of kfree(limit_string); just before
the return_VALUE(-ENOMEM); call, but I chose a different fix.
Except for this one return the function only has a single exit point at 
the end: label, and there it does proper cleanup of everything. So even 
though setting the return value (the 'count' variable) and jumping there 
results in a pointless kfree(NULL) call (since 'active' will be NULL), I 
thought this was a small price to pay for the bennefit of having just a 
single exit path for the function.
