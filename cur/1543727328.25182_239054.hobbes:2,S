I forgot to mention about something.
I totally deadlocked my machine just after setting the
/proc/sys/kernel/compute to 1 with
# echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/computer
The machine is 2x1G p3, and the kernel was SMP and I had experimentally
seti@home running in SCHED_BATCH mode in screen.
It was 2.6.8-rc1 with ck patches from:
http://ck.kolivas.org/patches/2.6/2.6.7/2.6.8-rc1/
I used these patches on 2.6.8-rc1 from it (of course in the proper
order:
__cleanup_transaction-latency-fix.patch
crq-fixes.diff
defaultcfq.diff
filemap_sync-latency-fix.patch
from_2.6.8-rc1_to_staircase7.A
get_user_pages-latency-fix.patch
jbd-recovery-latency-fix.patch
journal_clean_checkpoint_list-latency-fix.patch
kjournald-smp-latency-fix.patch
prune_dcache-latency-fix.patch
schedbatch2.3.diff
schediso2.3.diff
schedrange.diff
slab-latency-fix.patch
truncate_inode_pages-latency-fix
unmap_vmas-smp-latency-fix.patch
I haven't tried doing that again, because it is an important machine.
Just playing around with SCHED_BATCH again and reporting it.
I think I'll try to experiment on some other machine with that soon.
Regards,
Maciej
