     They're providing different things. Enumerating devices (as the kernel
sees them) is sysfs's business. Providing device nodes is not the kernel's
business, and should not be. (The kernel doesn't know the appropriate
permissions). And while it can be used to enumerate devices, that's not
really the function of /dev. It's providing the device nodes with the
appropriate permissions, and hopefully with names that are meaningful
to the users. So you really need both sysfs and /dev. The difficulty is
the mapping between sysfs and /dev. That mapping should not live in sysfs,
/dev is none of the kernel's business and sysfs is the kernel's playground.
     The mapping could be provided via symlinks, like so:
/dev/rdev/block/hdb/hdb1 -> /dev/hdb1
/dev/rdev/block/hdb -> /dev/hdb
/dev/rdev/block/hda/hda2 -> /dev/hda2
/dev/rdev/block/hda/hda1 -> /dev/hda1
/dev/rdev/block/hda -> /dev/hda
...
But I don't know if there is much point in doing so as udev already
provides that information.
