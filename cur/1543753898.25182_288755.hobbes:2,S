I use glibc 2.3.2 from debian testing (or unstable).  
This is not the problem though, because a reboot into 2.6.8.1 makes
X work without crashing.  The crash only happens with 2.6.9-rc2
or later kernels.  
So the only way glibc could be the culprit, is if the newer kernel
exports some new interface that this glibc manages to mess up.  Still,
even a buggy glibc shouldn't hang the kernel anyway.  Such issues
could crash (all) user apps, but shouldn't prevent the machine from
responding to sysrq sequences.
