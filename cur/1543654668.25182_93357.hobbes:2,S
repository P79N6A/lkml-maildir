If it fails to find a merge or insert the current 2.4 elevator
will stick a read at the far end of the request queue.  That's
quite arbitrary, and is the worst possible thing to do with it.
read-latency2 will put the read a tunable distance from the head.
Add a few embellishments to avoid permanent writer starvation,
and that's basically all it does.
So rather than just keeping on calling it a "hack" could you please
describe what is actually wrong with the idea?
