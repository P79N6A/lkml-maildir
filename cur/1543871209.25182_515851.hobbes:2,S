Two comments on this one:

Minor style point - I'd be happier with more parens:
+	return  (strstr(path, "/../") != NULL) ||
+		(strcmp(path, "..") == 0) ||
+		(strncmp(path, "../", strlen("../")) == 0) ||
+		str_ends_with(path, "/..");
C gets operator precedence wrong in one or two cases, so I just put parens
any place it might matter.
Second, there is code in externfs which does the same thing without
parsing paths which you might consider instead.  It sees whether the
requested directory is outside the jail by cd-ing to it and then
repeatedly cd .. until it either reaches / or the jail root.
A copy is below for your reading pleasure.
