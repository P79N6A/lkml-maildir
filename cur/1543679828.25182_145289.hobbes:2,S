Both the source and dest pages are being mapped with a sleeping kmap() at
present.  This way we can stop doing that, which is a significant saving on
highmem and a more significant saving on SMP highmem. (crypto uses kmap_atomic).
Why is the loop driver taking a copy of all the pages btw?  Looks to me
that we can just clone the bio and save an entire copy?
