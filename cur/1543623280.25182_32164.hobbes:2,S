And actually theres also a problem with  normal operations that disrupt flow 
control like QUEUE FULL returns and contingent allegiance conditions.
Basically, neither the SCSI mid-layer nor the low level drivers were designed 
to keep absolute command ordering.  They take the chaotic I/O approach:  you 
give me a bunch of commands and I tell you when they complete.

These are the "big" issues.  There's not much point doing all the work to 
implement ordered tags, if the end result is going to be no gain in 
performance.

Finally, an easy one...the answer's "no".  The cache control bits are the only 
way to alter caching behaviour (nothing stops a WCE=1 operating as write 
through if the drive wants to, but a WCE=0 cannot operate write back).
