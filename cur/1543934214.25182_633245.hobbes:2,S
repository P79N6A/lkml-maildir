I see that with CR0.NE set (*) we indeed don't care about IGNNE#...
However, I'm worried about this comment in arch/x86/kernel/i8259_32.c
===
/*
  * New motherboards sometimes make IRQ 13 be a PCI interrupt,
  * so allow interrupt sharing.
  */
===
Is it really safe to just blindly negate IRQ13 on everything out there, from 
regular PC through funky embedded thingies?
