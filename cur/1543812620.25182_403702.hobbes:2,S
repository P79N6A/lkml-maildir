blk_execute_rq_nowait() and pkt_generic_packet() also do the above two
calls.   It might be worth creating a new library function.

Rather than waiting for all commands to complete then freeing them all up,
it might be possible to free some of them earlier, while the rest are still
in flight.  Pipeline the reaping with the I/O completion.  A minor saving in
cycles and memory, perhaps.   Probably it's not worth the complexity - I was
just asking ;)
