I'm confused. Heikki's report is about a sata_sil controller and he 
didn't include any dmesg output so I don't know how you can conclude 
that quirking an IRQ to something less than 15 was the fix...
Also note that the fix was *not* quirking the device at all (your patch 
ensured that the quirks didn't run because IO-APIC was enabled), this 
hardly seems like an accurate way of arguing that quirks that change the 
IRQ to something less than 15 are *required*...
