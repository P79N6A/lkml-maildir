Have you actually looked at the maintainers file? It's a twisted mess
of outdated information, in no well formated order. The category list
in Bugzilla was an attempt to bring some sanity to the structure,
though I won't claim it's perfect. We really need a 3-level tree, but
that's a fair amount of work to code.
