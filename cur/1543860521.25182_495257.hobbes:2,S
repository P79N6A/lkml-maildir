Hi list(s),
chaostables is a small package containing some nice netfilter magic:
a module xt_portscan which matches the nmap scan types (including -sS) 
and more, and a xt_CHAOS module which slows down network scanners by 
triggering their codepaths for handling slow-working/'broken' operating 
systems.
Documentation is not yet fully complete, but it explains the details 
behind the portscan match and how it can be implemented without using 
the xt_portscan.ko module. By looking at the code and some example 
files, it should be possible to figure out how to use these (obviously, 
-m portscan [types] and -j CHAOS -- but a little self-experimenting is 
always good, too.)

(it is a remake of what was previously known, and now inaccessible, as 
AS_IPFW)
I happily take comments on anything.
Thanks and, FWIW, happy  new Year(),
Jan
