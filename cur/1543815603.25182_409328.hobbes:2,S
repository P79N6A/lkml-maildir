One non-obvious reason to inline it (at least in -mm kernels) is because the
slab leak detector stuff wants to find where it was called from - and if you
don't inline kcalloc(), you end up with the kzalloc() call it makes showing
kcalloc() as the caller.  If you inline it, you end up showing the caller
of kcalloc() instead, which is far more useful.....
