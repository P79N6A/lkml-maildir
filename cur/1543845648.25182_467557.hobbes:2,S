Ok, I have fixed all the mistakes you found. However, I have a
question about locking.
I have used 1 global mutex for all the fops: seek, write and ioctl.
They call down_interruptable() at the very beggining and up() just
before returning. I think that it's right.
However, what about the exported symbols? I have exported functions at
the ks0108 driver like EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(ks0108_writedata); The
cfag12864b drivers exports more symbols also, like:
EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(cfag12864b_write);
Should use the mutex all this functions too?
For example: Another driver can have a fops which isn't perform any
kind of locking. Such function is being executed twice at the same
time. And it calls some of my exported symbols. Then, I will have a
race condition in my driver.
(I couldn't find anything specific about that at LDD3, just for fops).
Thanks,
