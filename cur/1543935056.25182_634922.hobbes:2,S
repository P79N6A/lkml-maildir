Let's try...
menu "Level 1"
config FOO1
        bool "Want to have FOO1?"
        select FOO2
config FOO2
        bool "Want to have FOO2?"
        select FOO3
config FOO3
        bool "Want to have FOO3?"
endmenu
With the above example it is obvious when running mconf
that it does so.
If you choose FOO1 in mconf and then save the configuration
you will see all symbols saved.

This should be semantic equivalent and much easier to understand.
