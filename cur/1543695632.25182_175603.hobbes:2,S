UP machine - x86_64 however, if that makes any difference (sorry, my
initial message didn't contain much information, as I wasn't sure what
was relevant and what was not). The descriptor is passed over the unix
domain socket between the two processes.
I'm willing to try any debug patch that might help track down the
problem.
