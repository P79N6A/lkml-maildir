I see the same results, also using wli-2. I'll try mm1 as soon as it
completes compilation.
I assume that this breakage is unintentional, but it's not clear if it's
a bug in the kernel or cdrecord not coping with something actually fixed
in the kernel.
I may get a chance to look at it tomorrow, I don't think I have a stock
test11 kernel left :-(
