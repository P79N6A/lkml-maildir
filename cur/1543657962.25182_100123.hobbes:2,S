I see this every morning on my laptop.  Anancron starts my overnight
cron jobs (mostly find across the whole disk).  So, it is not SMP
specific.  I assumed there was some sort of timeout in galeon to make
sure it starts within a particular amount of time or just aborts it.
Always works the second time.
This is on 2.4.19-pre8 (usually) (I must build a newer kernel :-)).
