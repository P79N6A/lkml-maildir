It's not the code that crashes. It's the hardware that turns off the machine.
It only happens if I boot the machine and only if it's hot at this
time. Some hardware will turn off the hardware two or three seconds
after the radeon driver was loaded.
It seems to be some overheating protection that's going crazy.
