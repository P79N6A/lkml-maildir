Hi list,
Out of curiosity, has anyone else noticed something odd with Bluetooth
in 2.6.x kernels? On my Thinkpad X31 I can switch it on/off with Fn+F5.
Switching it on is no problem, but switching it off causes solid hang of
the Thinkpad. Only SysRq+b works.
It is not the whole world, but a little irritating. Also, I use
Bluetooth to hot-sync my Tungsten T|3. Same problem occurs on the 4th -
6th sync, solid hang of the Thinkpad. No debug output yet, if any
Bluetooth developers are interested to have this fixed, I am game to
help debug this.
Regards,
