Any modutils >= 2.3.19 automatically treats .modinfo as no load,
irrespective of what the kernel says.  Since modutils 2.3.21 fixes the
local root exploit on modprobe, nobody on kernel 2.4 should be running
modutils < 2.3.21.  I am tempted to put a check in modules_install to
detect insecure modutils and bitch.
Modutils 2.4 is backwards compatible down to 2.0 kernels.  I have no
qualms about removing __asm__(".section .modinfo\n\t.previous"); from
module.h in 2.4 kernels and will be sending in patches to do that,
along with other changes to module.h.  Worst case when omitting that
line and still using old modutils is a slightly larger module in
memory.
