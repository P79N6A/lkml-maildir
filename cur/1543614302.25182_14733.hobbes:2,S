AFAICT dmfe.c is hotplug aware, it has the required probe and remove
pci_driver functions.  But dmfe_remove_one is defined as __exit instead
of __devexit, it should probably be changed to __devexit and change
        remove: dmfe_remove_one
to
        remove:         __devexit_p(dmfe_remove_one)
The dmfe maintainer and/or Jeff Garzik needs to decide.
