The point I made was that SUN do support/use the GNU toolchain
internally, and everyone has used GNU on SUN since they started to
charge for the Solaris C compiler in the 80's. They also have RPM
and it is only recently they integrated Perl and I object to this
attitude whether it comes from SUN or MicroSoft
As to pkg* just look at what is missing/deficient -v- any OpenSource
tool, which was desingned by those that were going to _use_ it not
just tick a check box
It is typical of the period in which AT&T had more Marketeers and Lawers
working on Unix that there were developers. These were the guys who
helped to start the Unix wars.
