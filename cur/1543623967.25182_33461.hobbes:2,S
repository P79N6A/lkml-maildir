YES!!!
I've been working on the Foster patches and keep thinking that this

Make sure that every subarch has a maintainer/someone to blame who needs
to make sure their subarch also keeps up to date with the "generic" one
would help out a lot with this problem.

I think Martin's recent CONFIG_MULTIQUAD patches prove that the plus
side would outweigh any possible downside :)
