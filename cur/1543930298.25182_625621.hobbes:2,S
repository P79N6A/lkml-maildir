Try running powertop ( 
http://www.lesswatts.org/projects/powertop/
 ) and 
see what it reports.
I don't think dynticks will generally save huge amounts of power on a 
typical desktop machine. The big gains come from being able to stay in 
deep sleep C-states (C2/C3) for longer periods of time, but most desktop 
machines only enable sleep states down to C1.
