Well, uswsusp kernel <-> user interface should be stable (and is
already in 2.6.17)... So I'd in fact _like_ distros to use their own
versions of suspend/resume tools -- so they can get nice splash
screens, compression and encryption.
Version bundled with kernel will _not_ have those features... it
should be simple to get working, but will provide bare-bones
functionality.
(But as ABI is stable, there should be no problem).
