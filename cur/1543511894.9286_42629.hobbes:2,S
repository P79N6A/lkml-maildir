thanks for the kind replies. i tried out both your suggestions however
i'm still hearing the noise from the modem. might be worth mentioning
that when i made the bios upgrade, chat refused to dialout.
the exact error was: "chat[357]: Can't get terminal parameters: I/O
error", so i reinstalled the old bios which fixed the problem, but now
i'm getting this horrid noise.. and it's not the usual sound you hear
at the beginning of the handshake. it's more like radio static that
persists throughout the session.
here is my chatscript for your ref.:
REPORT CONNECTION
REPORT CARRIER
TIMEOUT 60
ABORT BUSY
ABORT 'NO CARRIER'
ABORT 'NO DIALTONE'
ABORT 'NO ANSWER'
ABORT 'Invalid Login'
ABORT 'Login incorrect'
'' ATZ
'' ATM1
OK ATDT123456
CONNECT ''
any other ideas?
