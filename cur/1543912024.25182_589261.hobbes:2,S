Yes. The more I think about your idea, the more I like it.

No, if de_thread() changes does release_task(old_leader). Now, if another
sub-thread didn't to release_task(self), it has a valid sighand, could be
found by /proc, etc, but its ->group_leader points to nothing, this memory
could be freed. Note the proc_task_readdir() for example.
In fact, even the release_task(self) becomes unsafe.

I don't think they can work, the first one is too early, the second is too
late...

Yes, I think this can work.

OK, we can drop it, I agree.

Yes, yes, I meant that it would be nice to do it other way, see below...

Yes, thanks, this is what I meant, and implies that handle_stop_signal()
can do nothing for SIGKILL.

Yes, but only if the signal was blocked before doing sigtimedwait().
Otherwise the behaviour is very different, and I don't know what
behaviour is correct. Perhaps, we can ignore the difference between
kill/tkill, at least this difference is always the same.
But TIF_SIGPENDING is "random", imho it is not good it can make the
difference. (In case I was unclear, note that wants_signal() checks
signal_pending(), so __group_complete_signal() may return without
"converting" sig_fatal() signal to SIGKILL).

Great,

Aha, I need to think about this, thanks!
