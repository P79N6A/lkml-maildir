release_region() is already done for the normal case.
It needs to be added for the error cases in advansys_detect()
[wow, what a long function].
For your kernel(s) and known hardware, it may not be much of an
issue.  However, the in-kernel driver needs to be repaired, but
it seems that not many people have the hardware...

Yes, request_region() should keep the region assigned until the driver
is exiting (unloading).  release_region() is already done in
advansys_release().

advansys_detect() should call release_region() if it encounters errors
[after it has called request_region() and returns an error].
request_region() doesn't assign buffers, it allocates IO resources,
as seen in /proc/ioports or /proc/iomem.  I don't know what happens
on repeated calls by the same driver|module, but in general a second
call will fail if the region is already allocated.
