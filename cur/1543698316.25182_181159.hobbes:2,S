There are PATA drives that do TCQ too, but you have to look for that feature
specifically.  IDE TCQ is in 2.6, but is still experemental.  I think Jens
Axboe was the one working on it IIRC.  He would have more details.

It's not SATA specific, and I'm not sure if any ide controller can support
TCQ or if only a specific list are compatible.
