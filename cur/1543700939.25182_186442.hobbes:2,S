"On access" seems to be exactly the wrong moment for a virus check - 
that way you are getting the check delay at the worst moment, when
the user actually want to use the file.  
Consider doing virus checking on write only, viruses spread
only at that time.  
Virus checkers that run during idle time s also a good idea.
