Would you actually do some work on generating them? I'm concerned that I'm 
going to end up putting more work into making patches, only to have you nack 
them for (what seem to me like) arbitrary reasons. I feel like all you're 
doing at the moment is pouring cold water on my work. Seeing you put some 
work into making mileage from the work I've put into Suspend2 would encourage 
me a lot. Forgive me if I sound pretty negative - between a couple of months 
of humid weather, lack of sleep and the event of the last few weeks, I'm not 
in the best frame of mind at the moment. Perhaps it would be better for me 
just to say "I give full permission for you and Rafael to rip out of Suspend2 
anything you find useful.", leave it at that and go find another hobby for a 
while.
