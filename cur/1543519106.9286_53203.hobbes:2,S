A person can be very smart, but collectively, people can be very stupid
sometimes and act strange in a group.  It's like a pack of wolves, and
when one attacks, the less brave ones join in the attack because they
feel "safe" and are responding to the group dynamic (I think this is
left over in our DNA from when we were cooperative pack hunters on the
steppes of Northern Europe). It's no problem.  Folks know I am trying to
help make Linux better, and Linux (and those folks) are helping to make
me better.  Nothing will stop me from performing this work on Linux.  I
don't profess to be an expert with bash or unix "administrator" hackery
-- I am an excellent operating systems developer however.  I've been
developing Windows NT Kernel components for almost 3 years now, but I
still don't know how to use Excel (???), but it doesn't matter for what
I do.  
I was asking some questions to get out our tools for the FS on Linux. 
That's all.  I have a really good handle on the VFS now as well, and at
some point, perhaps it will be I who is helping the newbie folks on the
mailing list figure out VFS 7.7.8 Linux?
