Hi,
I have been told to post the question have so hear goes..
When compiling bzImage on linux 2.2.0 or 2.2.1 i get the errors.
sg.c: In function `sg_ioctl':
sg.c:98: `SG_EMULATED_HOST' undeclared (first use this function)
sg.c:98: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
sg.c:98: for each function it appears in.)
make[3]: *** [sg.o] Error 1
make[3]: Leaving directory `/mnt/iomega/linux-2.2.0-pre6/drivers/scsi'
make[2]: *** [first_rule] Error 2
make[2]: Leaving directory `/mnt/iomega/linux-2.2.0-pre6/drivers/scsi'
make[1]: *** [_subdir_scsi] Error 2
make[1]: Leaving directory `/mnt/iomega/linux-2.2.0-pre6/drivers'
make: *** [_dir_drivers] Error 2
BTW /usr/src/linux is symlinked to /mnt/iomega/linux-2.2.0-pre6
Also I didn't get this error with linux-2.2.0-pre6 which compiled fine.
I have done
make clean
make mrproper
make xconfig   use my old confing from 2.2.0-pre6 and a new one
make dep
make bzImage
make modules && make make modules_install work fine. Any suggetions would be
most welcome and what have i managed to get wrong?
PLEASE could you also CC this mail to me as I'm not sucribed to linux-kernel.
regards paul
