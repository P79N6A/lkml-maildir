I've attached a small script I made to investigate some weird I/O
problems I'm seeing with both AS and deadline. Maybe the script can be
of some help, who knows.
It produces vmstat-like one line per second output.
It takes the data from /proc/diskstats (output should be the same order
as in that file, it's described in Documentation/iostats.txt)
Example output (from one of my tests that showed the problem):
$diskstat.sh hde

It's a sequential write, only one writer, lots of I/O-requests for a
very small number of sectors and the drive isn't very active.
It's a file recieved via network and written to disk.
Corresponding 'vmstat 1' output (not at the same time as the output
above):

Normally I see bursts of >30MB/s with a few seconds interval.
In this example there's some swapping but I havn't seen any indication
that swapping is the cause since it happens when there's no swapping
going on as well.
When this happens (not all the time) the machine freezes for 1-2 seconds
every 3-15 seconds. X freezes and if I ssh into the machine that freezes
as well at these intervals.
I've tried profiling when this happens but it just shows all time in
default_idle.
Maybe my problem is related, or maybe not...
