The above is a good description of the challenge i think.

Your split of netlink_unicast seems fine ; 
I guess the bigger question is whether this interface could be a
speacilized netlink protocol instead? It doesnt seem too nasty as is
right now, just tending towards cleanliness.
It seems that user space must first open a netlink socket for this to
work but somehow the result skb is passed back to userspace using the
mq_notify and not via the socket interface opened? Why should user space
even bother doing this? The kernel could on its behalf, no? Are you sure
there will always be one and only one message outstanding always?
cheers,
