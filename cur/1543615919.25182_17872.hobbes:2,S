   Perhaps the compiler should be optimising this better (can we replace
   the divide?)
As mentioned the PPC backend of gcc thinks that divides are cheaper
than multiplies.  On sparc64 for example we get multiplies by a
constant when emitting constant divides.
If you can make the struct a power of two as well as smaller, that
would eliminate both problems here but not fix the apparent bug in the
PPC backend.
