Setting CONFIG_X86_XMM seems to be the culprit.  With this enabled, the
kernel uses the XMM registers for memset, memcpy, etc., but it appears
that their state isn't being properly saved and restored.  Actually, I
believe it is being saved properly, but not always restored properly.
My program would show corruption of the registers, but they would
eventually be restored by the kernel.
With CONFIG_X86_XMM disabled, user-level XMM registers seem okay.
