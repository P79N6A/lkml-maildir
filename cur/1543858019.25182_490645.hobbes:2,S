Saving space is always good ;-)

However, pdt_1f_for_no_lun is really only one bit, saving another 4 bytes.

enums are a bit of a pain.  Even though scsi_target_state uses only two
values, it's represented as an int.  Unless you're on arm-eabi, when
it'll use less.  And even then, it won't use less than a byte, as it has
to be addressable.  I wonder if we can turn scsi_target_state into a
bit.  That'll save another 8 bytes total.
