Exim does it like this (approximately):
1. There is a list of domains considered "local".
2. There is an option that means the list will automatically contain the  
local hostname
3. There is another option that says the list will automatically include  
the [] notion of local interface addresses, as determined the usual way
4. The admin can add to that list anything (s)he wants.
(Note: 2 and 3 are both optional!)
As for netmasks: just use netmask notation when configuring how to treat  
hosts (such as who to allow relaying for). The probability that looking at  
the local network interfaces gives the right answer is close to zero.
