yes. and also that it inhibits entering deeper C states for longer periods.

I'm not sure if the registers are still there on quad cores, but I
would be surprised if they weren't.  Hitting them directly with
msr tools is probably the best way, or writing a small program
that manipulates /dev/cpu/*/msr directly.
