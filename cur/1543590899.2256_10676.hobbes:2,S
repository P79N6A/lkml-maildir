I used to think about cases of success. 8)
In any case the question follows: do we have some another generic
unique human-readable identifier? Only if device is PCI?
Actually, I am puzzled mostly with Andrew's note about "simplicity".
Andrew's patch was evidently much __simpler__ than yours, at least,
it required one liner for each device and surely was not a "2.5 material".

Nope, guy. Fixing fatal bug is always material of released kernel.
In any case the question remains: what is the sense of dev_probe_lock now?
