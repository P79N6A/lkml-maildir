I did some tries on patching the driver. When I did following changes it works 
here, but I don't know if it isn't broken on other machines?
Following changes I did in the 3rd patch created code:
       if( !default_phy && phy_home )
                default_phy = phy_home;
       else if( !default_phy && phy_lan )
               default_phy = phy_lan;
       else if ( !default_phy )
                default_phy = sis_priv->first_mii;
changed to
       if( phy_lan )
                default_phy = phy_lan;
       else if( phy_home )
               default_phy = phy_home;
       else if ( !default_phy )
                default_phy = sis_priv->first_mii;
dmesg output:
