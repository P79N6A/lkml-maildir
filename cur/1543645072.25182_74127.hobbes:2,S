In 2.5 LSM hooks are part of the Linux access checks, and any reason to
make your patch less intrusive inb 2.4 doesn't apply anymore.  Having
two checks for the same thing is indeed very bad in will cause harm
and maintaince burden in the long term.  Don't do it.

Show me a useful example that needs this argument.

Linus traditionally uses a keep it simple approach and so far that has helped
a lot to keep the system in a maintainable state.  Given that these `hooks
allow plugin in large, unaudited codebases like selinux or even propritary
modules this seems even more important to me.

And WTF is the use a security policy that checks module arguments?  Do
you want to disallow options that are quotes from books on the index
or not political correct enough for a US state agency?
