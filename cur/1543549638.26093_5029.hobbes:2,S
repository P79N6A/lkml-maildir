Hi,
In our Dell 8-way 1gb machine, test9-pre3 and above kernel
doesn't boot (test9-pre2 boots ok). I just get the message
	Loading 2.4test8................
	Uncompressing Linux... ok, booting the kernel.
Verified that the same bzImage boots correctly on another 2-way machine.
Let me know what kind of additional info is needed or if
anybody wants me to try a fix, I can do that.
