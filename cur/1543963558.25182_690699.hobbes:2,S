The SIT bug fix is, unfortunately, remotely exploitable memory leak.
As long as the SIT module is loaded and SIT packets aren't blocked by
the firewall, it's pretty easy to construct a frame that will be
leaked every single time (IPV4 header, with protocol == SIT, and
length just convering the IPV4 header).
I'm queueing that SIT fix up to -stable in parallel as I type this.
The TIPC fix makes sure the is enough header space for all possible
output devices.
Please pull, thanks a lot!
