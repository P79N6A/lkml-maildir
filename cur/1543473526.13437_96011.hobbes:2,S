I agree, it is high time that ALSA was made the standard sound driver
in Linux.  The existing sound module is limited; even worse, it
advertises a proprietary freedom-subtracted software package as the
remedy for its limitations.
When such an important piece of free software as Linux contains ads
for proprietary software, it gives the whole community an unfortunate
message--not the sort of message will inspire people to write
additional free drivers.
