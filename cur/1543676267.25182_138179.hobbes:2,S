Matt Wilson and I have been talking about some changes like this
recently.  This was because some of the ppc64 ports are doing some other
weird things to try to handle the bigger IBM machines (they were abusing
the pci structures pretty badly, not pretty stuff.)
We agreed that we should call this a "domain", too, and he has a patch
that he says works for X.
Hopefully this prod will get him to send out his patch :)
thanks,
