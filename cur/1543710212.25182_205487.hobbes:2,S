Yeah, I've been really wanting to try it out (esp. when you mentioned
that you'd be able to profile interrupt off code :).  I'll try to get
some more time on the machine and take a look.
Also, wli just informed me that I screwed up another aspect of the
profile too, the readprofile command i grabbed from the manpage (as my
time on the machine ran out) didn't output things in a very useful
order.
Thanks,
Jesse
