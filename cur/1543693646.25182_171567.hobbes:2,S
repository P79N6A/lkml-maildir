fixes acpi pci link allocation which could pick a bad irq causing an
interrupt storm.  typical symptom was hang on boot.  
If you see:
ACPI: PCI Interrupt Link [LNKA] (IRQs 3 4 6 7 10 *11 12)
...
ACPI: PCI Interrupt Link [LNKA] enabled at IRQ 6
where the link is not enabled at the current setting (11 in this case,
marked by *), you might experience this kind of hang.

events/0 is a kernel thread (keventd) used for scheduling work into process
context.  acpi uses keventd for handling acpi events, for example, so
runaway apci events will cause events/0 to chew up cpu.

I don't know, it shouldn't.
