I was thinking more of the register pressure in the load.
But in the case of gettimeofday I think it makes to do a kernel
implementation that is argument compatible with libc and then linker
magic could just short circuit the calls to the vsyscall page and libc
would not need to get involved at all, which removes one of the
indirect calls.
We could probably do that today by just renaming the function
gettimeofday.  But that is rude and has name space pollution issues.
