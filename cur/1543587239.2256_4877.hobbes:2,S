Regarding this issue, I have a similar problem if I do a free on my system I 
get :
---   total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:       1157444    1148120       9324          0      22080     459504
-/+ buffers/cache:     666536     490908
Swap:       641016      19072     621944
---
Now what I do a ps there seems no way to accound for the 500mb + of memory 
used. No single or group of processes uses that amount of memory. THis is 
very disconcerting, coupled with extremely high loads when cache is dumped to 
disk locking up the machine makes me want to move back to 2.2.19 from 2.4.3.
I would also be curious to see how the kernel is using memory...
TIA
