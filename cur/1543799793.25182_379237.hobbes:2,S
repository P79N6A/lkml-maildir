Subject: [PATCH 1/1] Fix Fibre Channel boot oops
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

The oops is characteristic of the underlying device being removed from
visibility before the class device, and sure enough we do device_del()
before transport_unregister() in the scsi_target_reap() routines.  I've
no idea why this is suddenly showing up, since the code has been in
there since that function was first invented.  However, I've confirmed
this fixes Andrew Vasquez's boot oops.

P.S. I told you if you waited a while I'd get another bug ...
