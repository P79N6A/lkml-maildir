I have a similar problem, first noted when using the SysRQ.
With the 2.4.x kernels i can press Alt-SysRQ, and then press the keys I want 
successively (e.g. S M O for Sync Umount Off). Now i have to release 
Alt-SysRQ everytime, and 1/2 of the time it doesn't recognize the press i 
gave.
Also, the Alt key tends to get stuck now and again, and sometimes for no 
reason i get multiple chars when I only strike a key once.
Odd behaviour.
