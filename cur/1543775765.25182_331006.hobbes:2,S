I actually tried that before posting.  Maybe I attempted to look for
wrong things but, beyond conversion examples, I found some postings
with a general theme "there is no point to make life easy for
binary-only modules" and not much else.  I am afraid that this
leaves me not much wiser.
Also, at least when dealing with 2.6.13-r1, neither
Documentation/feature-removal-schedule.txt, nor files in
Documentation/driver-model/ directory, mention anything about a
switch to EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL for relevant symbols.  The only thing I
can find about the later in "feature-removal..." is a note about RCU
API.
