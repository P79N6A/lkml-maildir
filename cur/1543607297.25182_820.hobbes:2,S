  Yes.

  Actually I think this is not a bug, it's a feature... If some process
has a CAP_SYS_RESOURCE capability then it can override the limits (that's
how I understand this capability). Hence it's got right to exceed user quota.
I think this is reasonable behaviour (root can do anything - suid binaries are
just making the will of root ;)).
  And BTW I know about no way how to know who opened the file...
