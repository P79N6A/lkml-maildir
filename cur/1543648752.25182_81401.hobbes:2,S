Christoph,
Thanks for your comments!
I'm making all the changes, except the items noted below,
which might need more discussion.

It's not a structure pointer, it's the structure itself.

A host id (hid) is used as the top 32 bits of the job id.
It gets initialized when you load the module, and can be
changed with the JOB_SETHID call.

We agree, but haven't had the time to fix this yet.
On IRIX, where this is ported from, this is how CSA is hooked into Job.
When it was ported over, they kept it the same way.

What we *really* want would be a new syscall, but we can't lock down
the syscall number in an external patch.  If we get integrated by Linus,
then we'd love to cut over to a new syscall.  For now, the ioctl on
/proc behaves almost identically to how a new syscall would,
in that we pass down arguments in binary format, can copyout
results, etc.  This is what the code on both ends is expecting.
I don't like the ascii file interface in this case, as it would require
the code on both sides to munge the arguments to/from ascii, and
would break the interfaces that are not just passing in arguments.
