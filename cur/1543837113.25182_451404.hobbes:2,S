Yes but still you want at FUTEX_WAIT time to tell the kernel the futex is 
private to this process.
Giving the same info at FUTEX_WAKE time could avoid the kernel to make the 
second pass (using only a private futex lookup), avoiding again the mmap_sem 
touch in case no threads are waiting anymore on this futex.
