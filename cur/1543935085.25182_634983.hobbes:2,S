There's a window in lock_all_devices() when dpm_list_mtx isn't held.  
We don't want device_pm_remove() taking an already-locked device off 
the dpm_locked list at that time.  So we do need to acquire dev->sem in 
device_pm_remove().

I don't see anything wrong with it.  All that will happen is that the 
removal will start before the suspend and finish after the resume.
