Do you think that disabling ACPI will be some problems with SMP?
I will try with "acpi=off".

But it is stuck because some resources are blocked by the other virtual
CPU, right? So, maybe this is the problem.

I will come back with more info.

Context switches are very low (~40) and there are ~40-50 processes
running. Only 2-4 processes are cpu-intensive (postgresql).
Thank you!
