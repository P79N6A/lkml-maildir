Hi Bruce,
I tested your fix and it works. Furthermore, since Linus accepted some of
my minor cleanups to rd.c into 2.3.29-pre1 it moved slightly so I made a
new version of your patch that applies cleanly to 2.3.29-pre1 and
re-tested it again (works, of course). A copy is on 
http://www.ocston.org/~tigran/patches/other/bde-ramdisk-2.3.29-p1.patch
regards,
Tigran.

-	 * If we're reading, fill the buffer with 0's.  This is okay since
-         * we're using protected buffers which should never get freed...
+	 * This has become somewhat more complicated with the addition of
+	 * the page cache. The problem is that in some cases the furnished
+	 * buffer is "real", i.e., part of the existing ramdisk, while in
+ 	 * others it is "unreal", e.g., part of a page. In the first case
+	 * not much needs to be done, while in the second, some kind of
+	 * transfer is needed.
+	 * The two cases are distinguished here by checking whether the
+	 * real buffer is already in the buffer cache, and whether it is
+	 * the same as the one supplied.
 	 *
-	 * If we're writing, we protect the buffer.
+	 * There are three cases with read/write to consider:
+	 *
+	 * 1. Supplied buffer matched one in the buffer cache:
+	 * Read - Clear the buffer, as it wasn't already valid.
+	 * Write - Mark the buffer as "Protected".
+	 *
+	 * 2. Supplied buffer mismatched one in the buffer cache:
+	 * Read - Copy the data from the buffer cache entry.
+	 * Write - Copy the data to the buffer cache entry.
+	 *
+	 * 3 No buffer cache entry existed:
+	 * Read - Clear the supplied buffer, but do not create a real
+	 * one.
+	 * Write - Create a real buffer, copy the data to it, and mark
+	 * it as "Protected".
+	 *
+	 * NOTE: There seems to be some schizophrenia here - the logic
+	 * using "len" seems to assume arbitrary request lengths, while
+	 * the "protect" logic assumes a single buffer cache entry.
+	 * This seems to be left over from the ancient contiguous ramdisk
+	 * logic.
