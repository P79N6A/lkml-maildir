I had been working on this in the past, and I've been ignoring it
recently.  But several people have pinged me about it, so I'll bring it
up again.
This is a rework of the NMI handling in Linux on x86 to provide a
list-handler type interface.  So you can request/release a tie-in for
the NMI chain.  Several things tie in to the NMI handling, and this
cleans up the mess that happens when you hack oprofile, IPMI watchdog,
kdb, etc. into the NMI handler.
The patch is at
http://osdn.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/openipmi/linux-nmi-2.5.67-v14.diff.
 
It's a little big to post to the list.
