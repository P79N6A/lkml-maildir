I'm not sure what you're trying to say. A TSS can't possibly be read-only, as the processor will need to write to it
any time it gets used.

It is relevant, for the preprocessor pseudo-assertion in cpu_init() to work. Anyway, I submitted the THREAD_ORDER
introduction as a separate cleanup-like (as you suggest) patch before, without getting any positive or negative
responses back...
