So you agree with my statement that it doesn't make sense because there 
are no out-of-line variants?

In the kernel (with gcc >= 3.1), _every_ inline is forced to             
always_inline resulting in gcc aborting with an error if it can't inline 
the function.
Therefore any such out-of-line version if it existed would be dead 
bloat.

It isn't the same, but "static inline" is the correct variant.
"extern inline __attribute__((always_inline))" (which is what
"extern inline" is expanded to) doesn't make sense.
