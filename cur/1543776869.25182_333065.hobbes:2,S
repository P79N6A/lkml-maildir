Do you mean the patch 
http://www.kernel.org/git/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=c434b7a6aedfe428ad17cd61b21b125a7b7a29ce
alone ?
I'll try to compile a kernel this way tomorrow, it's a bit late tonight...
Furthermore, please tell me if there are risks that I seriously break let's 
say my IDE devices interrupts doing this?
I use EVMS software RAID-5, and I don't want any problem with my RAID-5 set 
(I'm just out of some that took me hours...) especially because the EVMS 
snapshots I use for performing backups don't work anymore (I mean: are 
horribly broke) since I upgraded to a 2.6 series kernel.
This is quite another file, but just to explain that I don't have any recent 
and reliable backup these days, not time for me to take any unnecessary risk 
with my RAID-5 set until this gets fixed...

Well, that's what I'm worried about ;-))
Anyway, here are the differences I already noticed with and without your two 
patches, regarding the way the interrupts are distributed:
1/ Without your patches	(from an old note I took) :
[root@totor etc]# cat /proc/interrupts
           CPU0
  0:     626375    IO-APIC-edge  timer
  1:       1599    IO-APIC-edge  i8042
  2:          0          XT-PIC  cascade
  4:       1708    IO-APIC-edge  serial
  7:          2    IO-APIC-edge  parport0
 14:      19858    IO-APIC-edge  ide2
 15:       5220    IO-APIC-edge  ide3
 16:      30711   IO-APIC-level  nvidia
 18:       1799   IO-APIC-level  eth0, eth1
 19:     103365   IO-APIC-level  ide0, ide1, ehci_hcd:usb4, aic7xxx
 21:      47273   IO-APIC-level  uhci_hcd:usb1, uhci_hcd:usb2, uhci_hcd:usb3
 22:       2782   IO-APIC-level  VIA8233
(I've removed an SCSI controller and added another 2-channel IDE controller 
between the 2 outputs)
2/ With your 2 patches :
