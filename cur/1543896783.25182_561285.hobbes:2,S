There are two distinct problems here:
1) Documentation so developers who know C but not English have an easier time 
working with the kernel.  (Again, if you translate it, send it to me and I'll 
put it on the web.  After OLS, though. :)
2) Some kind of "language X patch maintainer", a bilingual person who can 
accept patches from people who don't speak English, submit them to the 
mailing list, and pass comments back and forth until issues with the patch 
are resolved.  So there could be a chinese patch maintainer, a spanish patch 
maintainer, etc.
