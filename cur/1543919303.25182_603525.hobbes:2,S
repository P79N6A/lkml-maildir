Huh, thought I did a more complete reply to this.  Must have farted on it.

Yep.

Yeah, its not pretty.  I'll have another go.

Given an op id number in .parainstructions, the patching code needs to
be able to index into something to get the corresponding function
pointer.  If each pv_* structure is its own little unrelated structure,
then the id has to be a <structure, id> tuple, which just complicates
things.  If I pack them all into a single structure then it becomes a
simple offset calculation.
That said, there's no need for pv_info to be in that structure, since it
contains no function pointers.  I'll move it out.
