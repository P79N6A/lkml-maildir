Hi, I just compiled and booted up 2.4.0-prerelease, dropped into X-Windows
and now gtk/gnome apps are giving the following warning:
Gdk-WARNING **: shmget failed!
Any ideas on what changed in the shm space to cause this?
This is a PII 333 RH 7.0 system 2.4.0-test10 worked just fine on this
machine.
/dev/shm is mounted:
none                     0     0     0   -  /dev/shm
The /usr/src/linux/Documentation/Changes file only mentions that this need
be mounted.
Tips, clues welcome.
