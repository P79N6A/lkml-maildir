Indeed.  That combination does work.
And that's the same linus.patch as I extracted from:
  ~akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.16-rc2//2.6.16-rc2-mm1/2.6.16-rc2-mm1-broken-out.tar.bz2
So no problem with you linus.patch.
The difference -might- be a different linux-2.6.16-rc2 with the above
than with hg's 
http://www.kernel.org/hg/linux-2.6,
 with the command "hg
co 19933", which is the release tagged v2.6.16-rc2:
    changeset:   19933:6a79f5a2de38
    tag:         v2.6.16-rc2

    summary:     Linux v2.6.16-rc2
My current suspicions ... a combination of:
 1) a congenital mental defect that causes me to find git difficult to use,
    and led to me thinking something had failed when it had not, and
 2) further fallout from some apparent burp in the production of the hg
    (mercurial) linux trees that Matt fixed today.
I can't do much about (1).  I will see if I can nail down (2), and send
Matt details, if I get far enough to be useful.
Thanks, Andrew, for running your <wget, wget> test.
That got me back on the road again.
