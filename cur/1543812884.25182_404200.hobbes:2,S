Subject: [PATCH] Prevent NULL pointer deref in grab_swap_token
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

grab_swap_token() assumes that the current process has an mm struct,
which is not true for kernel threads invoking get_user_pages().  Since
this should be extremely rare, just return from grab_swap_token()
without doing anything.
