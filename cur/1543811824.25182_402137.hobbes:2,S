Which is different from other power-saving modes how? If it means I
can read my email longer on the plane, it's a power-saving mode.

The time scale for heat propagation is enough slower than throttling
that I'd expect this difference to amount to approximately nil. It
takes many seconds for heat to propagate from a core to a thermal
sensor inside a laptop, and the intervening material (silicon,
ceramic, plastic, aluminum, air) acts as a low-pass filter so usage
spikes on sub-second scales are simply not visible. In other words,
the temperature will be the same for the same energy consumption
averaged over the time it takes for the heat to propagate.
And the time for a usage spike to be visible to a server room air
conditioner is probably closer to a ten minute time frame.
