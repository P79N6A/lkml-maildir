OK, well there are some patches in 2.6.12 that should make
things slightly better, and then some more patches in -mm
(not sure if they'll make it for 2.6.12) that should make
things slightly better again.
Basically they work towards reducing the memory allocation
"priority" for block IO requests, in relation to networking
and other atomic allocation requirements.
If you can't test the latest -mm, or 2.6.12-rc4, then wait
for 2.6.12 and 2.6.13 and check back on the problem.
Thanks,
Nick
