It's always really easy to use a personal ban (IE: killfile).  Just  
stick a list of email addresses somewhere and configure a mail client  
rule to autodelete all messages from those addresses.  My list now  
has about a hundred addresses (including Jörg's).  If they later  
decide to be mature/polite/etc and wish to resume discussions,  
they're welcome to create a new email account and start posting from  
there.
Cheers,
