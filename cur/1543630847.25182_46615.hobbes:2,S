No, but it does give much more incentive. With a broken makefile, you
still have to do "make clean dep all" after you've untangled the
headers, so not much is gained, with a working makefile, touching headers
doesn't mean clean build to get it right.
Keith, I would take silence from Linus to mean one of two things:
a) he's already decided he doesn't want it and he's being a dork
b) he's waiting to hear from someone who's taste he trusts before
   accepting it.
So you might try selling some of his lieutenants on your implementation
(even if doesn't make sense for them to adopt it into their trees until
Linus does).
