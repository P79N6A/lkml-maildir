it's been reported; it's even been fixed!  however, the fix is only in
a development version -- not in a "stable" release.  the most recent
release as found on 
ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gcc/gcc-java-2.95.2.tar.gz
dated 25 october most definitately *does* suffer from this bug.
there hasn't been any new release or bug-fix since october 1999.
judging from lurking on the gcc list it doesn't look like any new
release is immanent either (since there hasn't been any calls for code
freezes and such).
gcc 2.96 (not a release) doesn't suffer from it.  debian
offers a patched version of 2.95.2.  where do the rest of us go for
working gcc?  are we expected to pull things off the cvs tree at
cygnus?
