Subject: [PATCH] scsi_error device offline fix
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2002/10/21/35

This patch corrects a problem in scsi error handling.
When a device is offlined indicated by a message like ...Device offlined
- not ready...
the command return status was not being updated with a failure status if
the IO was a timeout.
I tested the patch on system with ips, aic, and qlogic fc adapters, but
was unable to generate a satisfactory device offline test case.
I did test this fix on uml with scsi_debug and generated a device
offline condition with verified this fix was working correctly.
