64-bit ports tend to have stacks around twice the native pagesize, e.g.
sparc64 has 16K stacks and 8K pages, similar to 32-bit ports, except for
ia64. The ia32 port has adopted the order 0 stacksize in the interest
of space savings relatively early among Linux ports. It would be nice
to get the same for all architectures, as higher-order allocations are
not good to have as anything but speculative (and obviously stacks are
not variable-sized) for reasons of fragmentation.
