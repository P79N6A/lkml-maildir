I don't understand this patch.  It places the .seq file as a target
that is rebuilt by invoking the assembler.  The .seq file is not
a generated file.
Can you explain the nature of the failure and why you believe this
fixes the problem (other than - "it seems to work with my testing").
The previous Makefile appears to be perfectly valid.

This also doesn't make a lot of sense to me.  Is gmake so
dumb as to not be able to understand that the invocation of
a single target may satisfy multiple dependencies?
