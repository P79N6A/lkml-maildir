Saturday's IDE patches seem to work for me.
Given the signed vs. unsigned issues there, I rebuilt pre 15 with "gcc_2.7.2.3
-W" and turned up these.

I checked the first group and gcc definitely did not do what was intended. An
expert need to look at these. The second group is surprising but what is wrong
depends on exactly how teh include file is used.
This is not an exhaustive test; it's just the parts I use.
