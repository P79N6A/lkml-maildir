What you propose is a semantic change and it's not related to the fix
IMHO.
Personally I like to continue to ask to expand_fdset this:
	"enlarge the fdset to N bitflags"
And N is the number of bitflags that you want in the fdset array.
It's like when you alloc an array in C:
	unsigned long array[1];
you want 1 element in the array.
Also consder that changing the semantic won't improve performances 
as the expand_fdset is not going to happen often as it won't enlarge
the fdset of only 1 bit at time ;).
While instead it may happen often that you fork with a large fd set
allocated, and for fork() the current semantic is the faster one:
	if (size > __FD_SETSIZE) {
                expand_fdset(newf, oldf->maxfdset);
