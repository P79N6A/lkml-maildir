	Your userspace tools are not using LFS compliant
	open(O_LARGEFILE), and stat64()  methods.
	EXT2 got corrected to do LFS limited open() handling
	at correct limit (2G-1) at around that time.
	There still lurks some mis-compliance issues at
	read() and write() which are still allowed to
	go over 2G-1 marker without the fd having
	O_LARGEFILE flag.
