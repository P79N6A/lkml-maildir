Ahh, looking at an earlier email I see that you have CONFIG_REGPARM=y too.
That could easily be pretty dangerous - there have been both compiler bugs
in this area, and just kernel bugs (missing "asmlinkage" things causing
bad calling conventions and really nasty bugs).
So please try without both PREEMPT and REGPARM. Considering that it's
apparently very repeatable for you, I'd be more inclined to worry about 
REGPARM than PREEMPT, but it's best to try with both disabled.
I also worry about that PDC202XX controller, but that 1352 is a strange
number (divisible by 8, but not by a cacheline or 512-byte sector or
something like that), so it doesn't _sound_ like something like DMA
failure or chipset programming, but who the hell knows..
