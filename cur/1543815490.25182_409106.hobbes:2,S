Hi
Back now :)
I've upgraded to 2.6.16 and applied your verbosity patches.
I've persuaded my array to re-assemble and during the resync I got these
messages
dmesg:
ata1: translated op=0x28 cmd=0x25 ATA stat/err 0x51/04 to SCSI
SK/ASC/ASCQ 0xb/00/00
ata1: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
ata1: error=0x04 { DriveStatusError }
...(18mins later)
ata1: no sense translation for op=0x28 cmd=0x25 status: 0x51
ata1: translated op=0x28 cmd=0x25 ATA stat/err 0x51/00 to SCSI
SK/ASC/ASCQ 0x3/11/04
ata1: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
smartd is not running
This did not cause the raid subsystem to boot the disk (thank goodness!)
