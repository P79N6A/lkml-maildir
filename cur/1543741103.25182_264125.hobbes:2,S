Subject: [PATCH 1/3] statm: __vm_stat_accounting
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/10/24/121

The procfs shared_vm accounting in do_mmap_pgoff didn't balance with
munmap in the case of shared anonymous: because file comes in NULL,
whereas vm_file gets set at the end by shmem_zero_setup.
Update file; and update vm_flags (a driver is likely to add VM_IO or
VM_RESERVED, modifying reserved_vm); and update pgoff (doesn't affect
procfs accounting, but could affect vma_merge - though at present all
drivers which modify vm_pgoff set a VM_SPECIAL which prevents merging).
And do that __vm_stat_account before advancing to make_pages_present.
