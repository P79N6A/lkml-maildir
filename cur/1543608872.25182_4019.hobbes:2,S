Hi all,
I know I will regret to throw my 2 cents to that discussion,
but I think that the discussion started because of the high
number of syscalls processing /proc information.
I would still like to see a binary interface to /proc data
regardless of the existance/redesign of human/shell/perl
parseable data.
feel free to ignore this post, but I really would like
to have a small library to do all that in binary form.
cheers,
Patrick
