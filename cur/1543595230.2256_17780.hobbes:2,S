I would expect the IRQ to shift as the system has a different
motherboard/processor than it did in December.

There are no conflicts, and PCI should be able to share anyways.
That machine, being a server, is only accesible via the network.  And when
all my SSH sessions to it died, and the pings weren't pinging, I went over
to the server corner, attached a monitor to the machaine and tried the magic
sysrq on the keyboard after verifying that I couldn't get a local response. 
As I said, I can easily lock an entire system in a way that corrupts files
even on a synchronuslly mounted partition from userland with no warning, no
error messages.
Waht part of this do you fail to grasp?
