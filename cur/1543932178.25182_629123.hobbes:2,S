How does ipr_pre_get notice this?

Sorry, I don't understand at all what's the problem is here. For the
common (non-poison) case, we initialize all objects *once* whenever a
cache is grown (see cache_grow calling cache_init_objs) which is the
whole point of having constructors. When poisoning is enabled, we
obviously cannot do this which is why we call the constructor for
every allocation.
