I don't know enough about VM/TLB stuff to know the right answer.
I suspect the MAP_* attribute/hint needs to be passed in together
with the mmap call if any arch (ia64?) would return a different
virtual address depending the attribute (e.g cached vs uncached).
And write combining might be done in a "layer" below the CPU in
the HW hierarchy. e.g. PCI Host bus controller might combine writes
for some MMIO regions. I don't know if arch specific mmap support
can figure out which HW is the right one to enable write combining
in for a particular MMIO region or PCI device.
I generally don't work with graphics devices and only recently
started poking at infiniband support (128-512MB BAR depending
on card option) to understand really well how BAR is accessed/used.

Yup.
