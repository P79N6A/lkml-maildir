Both smart and the internal blade diagnostics say "everything is a-ok
with the drive, there hasn't been any error ever except a bunch of
corrected ECC ones, and no more than with a similar drive in another
working blade".  Hence my initial post.  "Hardware error" is kinda
imprecise, so I was wondering whether it was unexpected controller
answer, detected transmission error, block write error, sector not
found...  Is there a way to have more information?
