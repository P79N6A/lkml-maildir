Oddness. Is it all on that same via chipset? (I have seen some reports of
the same chipset working on other mobos.)

Fair enough - I think so as well (although slightly less so since it's
not just the iwill mobo.)
On a (possibly?) unrelated note, memtest-mmx fails immediately (prints the
version, hardlocks).  But I've seen that on a stock PIII as well, so I
don't know what that's worth.  The oops I managed to decode was in
mmx_copy_page.
Is there a way to enable everything-K7-except-MMX? (Or, for that matter,
an easy way to see what K7 does that K6 doesn't.)
