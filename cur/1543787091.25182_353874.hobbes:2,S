Looks like it.

A rose by any other name would smell as sweet -Romeo
A flag by any other name would work as well -Joel
There are problems with any name we would use.  I personally like __GFP_USER 
because it is mostly user memory, and nobody will accidently use it to label 
something that is not user memory.  Those who do use it for non-user memory will 
do so with more caution and ridicule.  This will keep it from expanding in use 
beyond its intent.
If we name it __GFP_EASYRCLM we then start getting into questions about what we 
mean by easy and somebody is going to  decide that their kernel memory is pretty 
easy to reclaim and mess things up.  Maybe we could call it 
__GPF_REALLYREALLYEASYRCLM to avoid confusion.
If there is a consensus from multiple people for me to go rename the flag 
__GFP_xxxxx then I'm not that attached to it and will.  But for now I'm going to 
leave it __GFP_USER.
