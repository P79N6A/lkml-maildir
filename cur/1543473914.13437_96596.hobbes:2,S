It's always nice to be able to pass on the buck isn't it ;-)...
If nobody else volunteers, I'll take on the job, but I should warn
people that:
  a) I'm a physicist, not a crack programmer.
  b) I'm forced to travel a lot due to a number of other
     responsibilites.
In other words: I cannot guarantee that I'm the most competent for the
job, nor can I guarantee any 24 hour response time. As I said, though, 
I'll give it a try if nobody else wants to...
Cheers,
  Trond
