The point of using checksums (or digital signatures on files) is to be 
able to detect when the on disk file has been corrupted - not to look 
for updates.  With normal disks, even writes that are flagged as correct 
will occasionally actually end up corrupt on disk.  The rate that you 
need to validate the checksums is not at a 4 time a day rate.
Buying a nice, high array can make this much less of a concern, but 
those of us who get stuck using commodity disks should always have a way 
of detecting corruption and a backup (either on tape or on another box).
