It was great to see that 2.4.0 reintroduced ipfwadm support! I had no
need for ipchains and ended up using the wrapper around it that
emulated ipfwadm. However, 2.[02].x used to have "special IP
masquerading modules" such as ip_masq_ftp.o, ip_masq_quake.o, etc. I
can't find these in 2.4.0. Where have they gone? Without important
modules such as ip_masq_ftp.o I cannot use non-passive ftp from behind
the masquerading firewall.
Thanks,
Aaron Lehmann
