Subject: How to cause ioremap to map a different fb to the same va?

I have to framebuffer cards and if one fails, I'd like to call
ioremap for the second one so that the same virtual address
results to that clients who've mmap'ed the framebuffer are
undisturbed. The 2nd card wouldn't be used until the first one
has a problem and they are identical. Advice? tia.
