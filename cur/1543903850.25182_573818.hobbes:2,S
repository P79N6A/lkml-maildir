I could say the same thing ".. here we go again .."

before I sent this I must have accidentally delete the "Ok." which
originally proceeded the above.

I do disagree with the way your accepting this .. I wouldn't say "It's a
fact" either, since I don't accept similar comments from other people
the way your accepting it .. English generally is pretty loose. I could
say "That car is bad" which could literally mean the car is good or
nice.. There is a whole cornucopia of things that need to be considered.

I didn't argue with Peter , which means I agree with what he said .. He
was right, I was wrong and I accepted what he said in it's entirety ..
Certainly there is a level of respect there.. Had I argued with him it
would be different .
I'm a minimalist .. I don't say more than I need to, and it's not about
respect or superiority .. For example, I don't like saying "I think" or
"My opinion is" since that's implicit in my comments. If I'm writing
something clearly that's my opinion .. And a question mark alone
represents "Do you have it? If yes, are you willing to express it? If
yes then please do so"
