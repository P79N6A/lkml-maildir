Think about running a big simulation process that fork()s to
exec() /bin/mail in order to email its status or a partial
solution to the person that started the simulation.
A big rendering process that fork()/exec()s lpr.
Without overcommit you'd need to have the 500 MB of swap free
that the big simulation is using, even though it'll only use
1 MB for the little process that's being exec()ed...

It's not a vulnerability as such, it's more of a design
decision. Overcommit makes sense in a *lot* of situations.
Running more programs than what can fit in your memory
never makes sense, the difference between overcommitting
and non-overcommitting systems is how they handle an
overload situations.
Non-overcommitting systems will refuse further allocations
when memory _could_ be filled up by all current processes.
Overcommitting systems will allow the system to go much
further, possibly processing the same load that a non-overcomm.
system would not be able to process. However, when it breaks
down it breaks down in a slightly less predictable way ...
