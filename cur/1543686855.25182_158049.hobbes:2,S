Hi,
 I am using "HP Prolient DL 380 Dual processor(2X2.4Ghz) with 6GB RAM with
Readhat Linux 7.3 OS. But the problem is that the kernel is detecting only
4GB RAM and single CPU(Not two CPU's).The kernel version is
2.4.18-3 on an i686". Can you please suggest how to
configure dual CPU and 6GB RAM on this server.
