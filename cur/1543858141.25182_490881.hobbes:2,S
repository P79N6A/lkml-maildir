Maybe it could be an __always_inline inline function (it has to be 
inlined to get the callsite based lock class key right) - but i'm not 
sure about the include file dependencies. Will probably work out fine as 
seqlock.h is supposed to be a late one in the order of inclusion - but i 
didnt want to make a blind bet.
