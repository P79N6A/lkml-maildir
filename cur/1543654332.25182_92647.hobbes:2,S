No. In this case, the problem appears to be that the cookie issued by
the server for the end of directory case is not unique.
If userland calls an extra 'readdir()' after EOF is reached, then as
far as the client is concerned, this sort of thing cannot be
distinguished from readdir()+seekdir()+readdir()..
