I think the correct solution is really not to resend level type
interrupts. If the interrupt line is still active, then the interrupt
comes up by itself. I'm cooking a patch for that.
The other question is: 
Is the driver confused by the resent irq or is the chip-set unhappy
about the resend ?
We could figure the latter out by activating the software based resend
method.
