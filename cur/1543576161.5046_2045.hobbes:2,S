In the RFC 1750, they write it is not recommended to rely on computer clocks to
generate random. Isn't it this case?

But it reduces the entropy. When I have a 486/66 and sniff packets accurately to
3MHz, only 4 bits remain. These bits need not to show a uniform distribution so
it could be even easier to guess them.
