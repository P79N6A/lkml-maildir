Right. 
I was guessing how Wakko might have written a stat based app, and then I
go on to say this violates the interface by peeking under the kernel's
skirt. I had already checked, and the MAJOR and MINOR macros in kdev_t.h
are wrapped up an inside #ifdef __KERNEL__, and so are not available to
user space. User space simply has no way of knowing what a dev_t might
be.
