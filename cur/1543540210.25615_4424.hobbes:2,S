I've been thinking about this for a while now.  I'd love to be able to
build and distribute from a single point a variety of kernels/modules and
have things installed into various locations.  Ie, I'd like to enhance the
KERNELRELEASE stuff to also include something like LOCALINFO.
I can't use EXTRAVERSION because it's often in use (ie, pre17).
