You are describing, roughly, the waterfall model of software development.
Linux kernel work is closer to something resembling the prototype
and/or spiral model.
See further explanations of these terms, for instance, at:
  
http://model.mercuryinteractive.com/references/models/
But, in any case, Linux kernel work _does_ have a rather extensively
articulated development model which we find is working rather well,
thank-you.  For all I know, this methodology was defined by some
traumatic event at the birth of Linus - whatever - seems to work.
When in Rome, do as the Romans.  And especially don't be surprised
at being pushed aside if you protest that we aren't behaving as the
French.
