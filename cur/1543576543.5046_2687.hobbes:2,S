Basically, I wanted to think of "submit_bh()" as a pure IO thing. When we
call submit_bh(), that is basically the same as "statr IO on this thing".
Which implies to me that submit_bh() doesn't care, or know, about why the
higher layers did this.
Which is why I prefer the higher layers handling the dirty/uptodate/xxx
bits.
