it means it uses old support for PACKET sockets in PF_INET protocol
family, i.e. a call like socket(PF_INET,SOCK_PACKET,0) instead of the
special protocol family for this purpose called PF_PACKET. If you truss
tcpdump you will see something like this:
socket(PF_PACKET, SOCK_DGRAM, 0)        = 3
which answers why you no longer get messages like "tcpdump uses
obsolete..." i.e. new tcpdump (as of a few years ago) does the right thing
(while your tnt, whatever that might be, doesn't).
