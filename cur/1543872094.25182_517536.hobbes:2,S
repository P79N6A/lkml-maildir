went down to 2.6.17 - earlier is lacking due to correctly booting my machine.

i started to bring in a load of printk's into v4l dvb repository to find out what exactly 
is causing the interrupt to appear and why it is not handled.
the bug is reproducible by insmod/rmmod dvb_ttpci over and over.
yesterday late night i tried a bit too much and my machine freezed as a whole.
even kernel sysrq didn't work anymore.
i found some point, that after fireware load the interrupt is fired again.
will check if there is a solution to create a workaround and try to fix it afterwards.
it does NOT appear on a different computer same card. i think it is a problem
in combination chipset - card - bios.... dunno by now, but will find out.
thanks for your information, linus.
