Hello everyone,
      here's a little problem I'm experiencing ... I am trying to set
up Linux ( kernel 2.4.18 ) on SMP machine ( 2 AMD Athlons XP, AMD 762
motherboard ). First of all, it wouldn't even boot up unless I turned
off either MPS 1.4 ( in BIOS ) or APIC ( in kernel ). Without one of
them, it boots, but now I have another problem. I can't make emu10k1
based sound card to work. I receive this:
Creative EMU10K1 PCI Audio Driver, version 0.18, 08:34:52 Apr 16 2002
PCI: Enabling device 00:09.0 (0004 -> 0005)
PCI: No IRQ known for interrupt pin A of device 00:09.0. Please try using pci=biosirq.
emu10k1: IRQ in use
If I try to insmod emu10k1.o with 'pci=whatever' parameter, insmod
complains about not having 'pci' module parameter.
I tried turning on and off MPS 1.4, APIC, even completely disabling
SMP in kernel. Nothing helps. Sometimes error message contains
mentions of 'buggy MP table' ( why would it be buggy - everything
works perfectly in Windows? )
Is there a way to fix it?
