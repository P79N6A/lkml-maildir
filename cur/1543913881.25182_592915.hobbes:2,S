The last BAR on the nForce4 ADMA controllers on this board are at 
0xdfefe000 and 0xdfefd000. But it looks like PnP ACPI is also reserving 
those memory ranges:
Aug 30 14:08:02 alcor kernel: pnp: 00:09: iomem range 
0xdfefd000-0xdfefd3ff has been reserved
Aug 30 14:08:02 alcor kernel: pnp: 00:09: iomem range 
0xdfefe000-0xdfefe3ff has been reserved
Which I very much doubt it should be doing, the BIOS doesn't need to 
reserve PCI BAR ranges in the ACPI tables. This sounds like a BIOS bug. 
You might want to check for an update from Supermicro.
