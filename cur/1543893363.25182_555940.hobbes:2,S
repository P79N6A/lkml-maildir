Ok, in fact when the kernel is moved elsewhere in the address space it
will decode properly.  There was a check in there for not loading at the
right address which was catching me out ... as errors do not show up as
we have no serial support.  Doh.
Once I had gotten this decoding at other addresses I simply tried moving
the base address for the kernel elsewhere.  I am able to successfully
boot the kernel at 16MB and 256MB.  This seems like something outside
the decoder scribbling.
I would not normally recommend moving the base address of the kernel.
However, this problem at least so far has only shown up on the NUMA-Q
platform which is at best described as a very small volume
sub-architecture.  There are areas in which it differers from mainstream
BIOS and we are no longer able to get details of these differences.
We actually have no proof as yet this is or is not a NUMA-Q specific
problem.  For instance these machines tend to run less modules and more
builtin stuff than the average due to an owner dislike of modules.  So
we could have a lurking kernel size issue or similar.
I am therefore proposing change the base address for NUMA-Q only (patch
to follow this email).  And that we remain aware of the issue and on the
lookout for similar breakage on mainstream x86 platforms.  At least with
this patch we can get wider testing on the rest of the kernel.
