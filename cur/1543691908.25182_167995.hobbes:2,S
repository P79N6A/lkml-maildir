In sysfs it is easy to see which devices a driver is supporting.
For example /sys/bus/pci/drivers/e1000 links to 0000:02:0c.0 in my system.
But how do you go the other way; starting from 0000:02:0c.0 to determine the
driver? Is the best solution to loop though the drivers directories searching
for the device? Or would it be better to change sysfs to add an attribute to
each device containing the driver name?
In /proc/bus/pci/devices the driver name is the last field.
