If there really are FAQ reporting this, it might be simpler to make the
kernel accept /dev/XXX than to try to fix all FAQs, and it would be more
intuitive to people who type on lilo command line.

You'd better send an "unified diff" (diff -u) which includes one level of
kernel directory. You diff then starts like this :
--- linux-2.4.22/drivers/char/console
+++ linux-2.4.22-bm1/drivers/char/console
And all close changes are merged in a chunk with lines starting with + and -.
Then it's more convenient to compare small changes.
Please take a look at Documentation/SubmittingPatches for more info.

It's good to Cc Marcelo when you're sure it's an obvious patch that must be
applied, but if you think it may be discussed here, it's better not to flood
his mailbox, considering many people reply to all recipients.
Cheers,
