The reason they're exported is that when relayfs was being considered
for inclusion, GregKH requested that the relay file operations be
exported, which I did but didn't actually try to use them there until
now.  It turns out that the current patch's changes are needed in
order to be able to do that.  The reason behind being able to do this
I assume is so that developers can use relay files do ad hoc tracing
inside debugfs rather than have part of their application in debugfs
and another part in relayfs.  Maybe Greg can chime in as to whether he
thinks it's still useful, or maybe I should just remove the export?
