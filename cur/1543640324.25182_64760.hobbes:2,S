There are exactly two cases:
a) you care about entropy accounting being done right
b) /dev/urandom is good enough
Note that these patches allow you to satisfy folks in a) while mixing
in _more_ data for b).

Let me clarify that 2-5 orders thing. The kernel trusts about 10 times
as many samples as it should, and overestimates each samples' entropy
by about a factor of 10 (on x86 with TSC) or 1.3 (using 1kHz jiffies).
The 5 orders comes in when the pool is exhausted and the pool xfer
function magically manufactures 1024 bits or more the next time an
entropy bit (or .1 or 0 entropy bits, see above) comes in.

My box has been up for about the time it's taken to write this email
and it's already got a full entropy pool. A 4096-bit public key has
significantly less than that many bits of entropy in it (primes thin
out in approximate proportion to log2(n)).

The patches will be a nuisance for anyone who's currently using
/dev/random to generate session keys on busy SSL servers. But again,
with the old code, they were fooling themselves anyway. /dev/urandom
is appropriate for such applications, and this patch allows giving it
more data without sacrificing /dev/random.
