well, not really. unionfs is close because with a "mount -o bind" and 
additive mounting my problem would be solved, but what i'm looking for is a 
very high-level solution. as i said, my idea of solving this is to have an 
inclusion directive in directory-files...
has nobody ever felt the lack of such functionality??
