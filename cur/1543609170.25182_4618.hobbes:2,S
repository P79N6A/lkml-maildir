Subject: [PATCH] Adding KERN_INFO to some printks
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

Hi Linus, all,
I configured my syslog to sort all kernel msgs to
/var/log/syslog.N.debug|info|notice|warn|... (you got the idea)
and made it spew everything on tty12, and warnings only to tty11.
I got tired of seeing purely informative messages on tty11 every
boot. They shouldn't be there.
I'll spend some time looking thru the code and adding KERN_INFO
where apprppriate. First such patch against 2.4.13 is attached.
Feel free to flame me if I'm doing something wrong.
