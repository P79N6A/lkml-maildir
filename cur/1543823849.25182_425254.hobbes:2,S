It's really "-= LATCH". :)

Ok, I'm not that familiar with Intel hardware (it must be crappier than I 
thought). Is there really no way to detect the pending interrupt (e.g. 
what do_timer_overflow() does)? Without that information one can really 
only guess the time.
It's not that important if it's not completely correct for SMP systems, 
they usually have other sources, but for the few systems there this is the 
only time source, we should at least make an effort to avoid the read 
error.
bye, Roman
