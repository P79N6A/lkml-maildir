Does ongoing DMA actually matter?  After all,the memory which is being
dma-ed into is pre-reserved and allocated for that purpose, and the dump
kernel won't be using it.
It would be polite to pause for a number of seconds to allow things to go
quiet, but apart from that I think all we need to ensure is that the
drivers in the dump kernel firmly whack the hardware before reinitialising
it?
