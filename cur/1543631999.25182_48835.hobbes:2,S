Well, again this runs the same way as Victor's other personnal attacks.
Dismissing arguments because of who points them out doesn't really
work.

In light of every person I met in the last 2 years I started working against
this patent and in light of all the testimony seen here, it certainly is.
Read the start of this thread to get the full argument behind this.

These claims have been contridicted a couple of times now by many people

That's not the point is it? The point is that Victor's patent and its
use to make money from GPL software is unique in the open source
software world. Hence, any time you talk about this issue, it has
to be taken outside the standard open source frame of discussion
because there is no other equivalent case.

Did you read all the emails stating that clients simply don't use
Linux because of this patent and because of Victor's lack of clarity
on the actual interpretation of how far reaching his patent is?

I said it before that I am aware of the issues involved.

Actually, it is this thread that is not getting anywhere and that
is getting us back to the exact point I summarized earlier in the
following post:

We should leave it at that.
