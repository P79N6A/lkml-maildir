  Well it maybe the kernel itself, I remember some one saying to send e-
mails about this to another list but can't seem to find it in my
archives.  Any how, I don't want to open a can of worms until said
company blows me off again about the code for said device. Now that I
think about it, I'll send them a copy of the GPL licence if they do and
see what happens.
