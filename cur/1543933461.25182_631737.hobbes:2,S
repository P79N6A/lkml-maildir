Please, don't do that.
The current code is following the ACPI 2.0 specification (and later) quite
closely and while we can add a special case for the 1.0-copmpilant systems,
the failing ones tend to be supposed to follow ACPI 2.0 (or later).

acpi_gbl_FADT.header.revision is equal to 3 for ACPI 2.0-compilant systems
(section 5.2.8 of the specification).

Same here (so the comment is wrong).
