This still all seems really really ugly. Is there anything wrong with
throwing all these extra cases out and replacing the entire lot with
	prctl(PR_SPARSEFD, 1);
to turn on sparse fd allocation for a process ?
Anyone needing to deal with certain special fds will use dup2() anyway so
a task global switch seems to be cleaner and make the behaviour simply to
flip on, with no extra calls (and you need to submit man pages for them
all too), and also more importantly no new glibc stuff should be needed,
and a process can try to set sparsefd, fail and carry on so its more
portable and back portable.
