It is. It is needed for the vsyscall fallback for UML (UML cannot
support fixed address vsyscalls) and when we have to disable user
space vgettimeofday for other reasons (e.g. to use alternative time
sources that cannot be mapped to user space or doing time workarounds
that require real locks)
But any security advantages of not having it are at best illusionary.
If you don't believe me just grep any random executable for 
0xf 0x05 (= syscall) or 0xcd 0x80 (= int $0x80). Even if it wasn't 
in the vsyscall page you just have to find these two bytes somewhere
(doesn't have to be an own instruction, they occur commonly as part
of other instructions or data) and jump to them. Executables are
at fixed addresses.
