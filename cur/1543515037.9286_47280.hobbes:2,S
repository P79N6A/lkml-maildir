Subject: small multi-threaded coredump patch
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hello,
    Here is a short patch to coredump a segfaulting thread in a
linux-threads program.  Rather than dumping to core.pid() or other
more complicated scheme, I added a flag to the mm_struct to mark
whether the corefile has been generated.  The patch assumes that the
process/thread which caused the segfault will be the first to dump.
I've done some testing on single and dual cpu boxes, and this always
seems to work.
As the patch is really short, here it is.  My changes were made (and
tested with) the 2.3.18 kernel, but the patch will also apply against
the most recent kernel(2.3.25).
