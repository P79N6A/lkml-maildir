OK, well Greg KH will be the main target of this work..
Can you do something a bit more friendly than application/octet-stream
encoding, btw?
+#if BITS_PER_LONG == 64
+#define U64FMT "016lx"
+#else
+#define U64FMT "016Lx"
+#endif
We've avoided doing this.  We prefer to do
	printk("%llx", (unsigned long long)foo);
which is tidier, although a little more runtime-costly.
Your approach assumes that all 64-bit architectures implement u64 as
unsigned long (as opposed to unsigned long long, which I guess is legal?) I
don't know if that's a problem or not.
Also, the patches introduce tons of ifdefs such as:
+#if BITS_PER_LONG == 64			
	return (void __iomem *)pci_resource_start(pdev, PCI_ROM_RESOURCE);
+#else
+	return (void __iomem *)(u32)pci_resource_start(pdev, PCI_ROM_RESOURCE);
+#endif
We really should find a way of avoiding this.  Even if it is
#if BITS_PER_LONG == 64
#define resource_to_ptr(r) ((void *)(r))
#else
#define resource_to_ptr(r) ((void *)((u32)r))
#endif
in a header file somewhere.  Open-coding the decision all over the place is
unsightly.
