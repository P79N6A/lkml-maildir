I've done benchmarks of this type on the Origin2000 with IRIX 6.5 and 
the page size can have a big effect on performance. It's very easy to
experiment since individual users can select the page size used by their 
application for code, data, and stack. I don't know how the OS deals 
with that though.  Seems like it could be a tricky thing to do.
