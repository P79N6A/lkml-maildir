hello Jacob,
The real question here is when you do release a driver, will
it allow Linux users to effectively use the SB Live hardware.
Creative's track record on windows NT drivers isn't that good.
If the register definitons and tech info were made public 
(does this really threaten Creative's business?) then you will
find a lot of volunteers willing to get a driver out a lot faster. For
a product like a sound card, people will happily use an alternative
card if drivers are not available, so any delay costs. You should 
also consider that there isn't much interest in adding proprietry 
components to the linux kernel.
cheers
Greg Smart
