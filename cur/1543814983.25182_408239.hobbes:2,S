Instead of breaking all filesystems that need to create large files,
the patch should instead set "i_flags | EXT2_LARGEBLK_FL" only on inodes
that are larger than 2TB and use "blocksize" i_blocks on those files.
This preserves compatibility with existing filesystems and doesn't
impose any breakage opon an existing filesystem for anyone who wants
to use this feature.
Cheers, Andreas
