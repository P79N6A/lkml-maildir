The only reason it exists in its current form is because Alan says
we can't get rid of the serial port initialisation due to the x86
requirement for serial console to be initialised reasonably early.
Unfortunately the early console stuff (afaik) never made it in to
the kernel, so we've had to keep this hanging around.
Maybe once this problem is solved we can consider dwmw2's suggestion.
