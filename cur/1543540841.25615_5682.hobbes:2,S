We have a Linux distribution that is a VPN/Firewall on a floppy, using
the 2.2.x kernels, and ipchains, heading for embedded.
I feel that the netfilter in the upcoming 2.4 series seems to hold a lot
of advantages.
But since our distribution now fits on a 1.44 floppy, overall size is a
great concern.
Has anyone looked at the footprint size of having the 2.2 kernel and
ipchains/ipmasqadm vs 2.4 kernel with netfilter?
(Just starting evaluating the 2.4 series now)
