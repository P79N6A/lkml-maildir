Ok, more data points.
- Zwane Mwaikambo tried enabling yenta + i82365 + pnp on his machine.
  The boot messages for PCMCIA were:
	Linux Kernel Card Services 3.1.22
	  options:  [pci] [cardbus] [pm]
	...
	ti113x: Routing card interrupts to PCI
	Yenta IRQ list 0000, PCI irq9
	Socket status: 30000006
	Intel PCIC probe: not found.
  As you can see, the PCIC probe didn't find any PNP devices.  No
  problems were noticed.
- I've just tried modular PCMCIA, inserting both yenta and i82365 on
  an (arm) machine, obviously without PNP here...
	Linux Kernel Card Services 3.1.22
	  options:  [pci] [cardbus]
	irq 21: nobody cared
	Yenta IRQ list 0000, PCI irq21
	Socket status: 30000007
	irq 22: nobody cared
	Yenta IRQ list 0000, PCI irq22
	Socket status: 30000811
	Intel PCIC probe: <7>PCI: master abort, pc=0xbf020818
	PCI: master abort, pc=0xbf020818
	PCI: master abort, pc=0xbf020818
	not found.
  Again, no PNP activity as expected, and no undesirable side effects
  caused by inserting and removing PCMCIA cards.  (the master aborts
  come from attempting to access 0x3e0/1 and having nothing on the PCI
  bus to claim it... yes, not even an ISA bridge...)
Could the problem be PNP related?  I don't see much material change in
the PNP layer between 2.5.70 and 2.5.71 though.
Can other people try the CONFIG_YENTA=y, CONFIG_I82365=y, CONFIG_PNP=y
and report their results (in particular the dmesg from boot, and whether
the machine locks when they insert a card _after_ boot.)
