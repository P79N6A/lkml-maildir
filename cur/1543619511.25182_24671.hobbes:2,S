Well, what I meant was have some kind of pointer in the collapsed stuff 
that conflicts with the detailed stuff, and requires the user to pick 
which on they want. Ideally, this could default to user picks, but a 
repository policy of 'only take collapsed versions' could be used for 
upstream trees, say like linuxppc_2_4.  (linuxppc_2_4_devel could take 
detailed versions).
