It goes like that:
2.6.7
2.6.7 + 7-bk<n>
2.6.7 + 8-rc1
2.6.7 + 8-rc1 + 8-rc1-bk<n>
2.6.7 + 8-rc2
2.6.7 + 8-rc2 + 8-rc2-bk<n>
...
Since rc1 works and rc2 doesnt, you want 
	linux-2.6.7.tar.bz2 +
	testing/patch-2.6.8-rc1.bz2 +
	snapshots/old/patch-2.6.8-rc1-bk<n>.bz2
(all under /pub/linux/kernel/v2.6 on ftp.kernel.org and mirrors)
