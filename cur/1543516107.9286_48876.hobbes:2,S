No, IMHO you have it backwards: users of devel kernels should carefully
read Documentation/Changes.  For that matter, *anyone* compiling *any*
kernel for himself should carefully read Documentation/Changes.
At least *you* got an obvious error for your efforts.  It was much
worse for those poor sops that compiled 2.0.x kernels with egcs.  The
only warning *they* got that something was amiss was that the X server
wouldn't start.
