In our "extreme prejudice" suspend (this is in the context of masking 
& recovering from a fault in a fault-tolerant machine) we have cases 
in which completion of pending commands isn't possible. Our solution 
is to issue a SCSI bus reset, and terminate all outstanding commands 
with an appropriate (retryable) error. This is especially easy to 
implement in drivers that use SCSI bus reset as a routine (though 
last resort) error recovery mechanism, since the requisite logic is 
already in place. Not pretty, I suppose, but effective.
One model we've considered (but haven't implemented yet) is to make 
parents in the device tree responsible for suspending their children, 
so the suspend propagates down the tree and each node "knows" how to 
suspend its children, assuming any special action is required. So a 
SCSI HBA, for example, would be asked by its bus parent to suspend, 
and in turn would suspend its SCSI device children before suspending 
itself. I'm not quite sure how virtual device layers like md would 
fit into this scheme, since they can cut across device and power 
hierarchies.

Our first implementation was under Solaris 2.x (SPARC) in which the 
parent->child relationship is bus->hba->sd. scsi isn't in the tree; 
it's more of an interface layer between hba & sd. fwiw.
