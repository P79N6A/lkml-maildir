I don't think they'd dare spit in our faces quite that directly.
They think binary modules are permissible because we don't seem to have
consistently stated an intent contradicting that - some individual
developers have, but ultimately Linus hasn't.
I'm not talking about any legal issues to do with derived works,
copyrights or licenses - a clear statement of intent is probably all
it'd take to tip the balance.
