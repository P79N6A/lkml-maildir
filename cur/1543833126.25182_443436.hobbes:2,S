How exactly are /dev/tty0 and /dev/console supposed to work?
I thought that /dev/tty0 was the currently active tty.
And /dev/console is where the printk output is going.
/dev/tty0 appears to be snapshoting the currently active tty when it
is opened. It does not track changes to the foreground console.
It looks like TIOCCONS effects both /dev/tty0 and /dev/console. tty0
uses console_fops with redirected_tty_write().
Am I reading the code right, and are these the correct behaviors?
What is the equivalent to the setconsole command for Fedora?
