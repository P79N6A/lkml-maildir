We do it (simulations that is) on normal 1U and desktop machines. No special
cooling and stuff. And it does not cause any problems. Granted we don't use
cheap/crappy machines but still it's unmodified off-the-shelf HW.
btw That ZPro machine that I mentioned used to run with idle=poll for weeks
and fans would never spin up unless you put real load on it.

Agreed.
