They might one day have separate store buffers for different storage
domains, to support a different cache coherency protocol for example
without the complexity of having to couple the dependencies of uncached
writes with the dependencies of cached writes.
Basically, relaxing the rules /might/ make the implementation easier.
No-one knows until the next chip is implemented.
