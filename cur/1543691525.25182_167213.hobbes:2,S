We have considered the option of using Oprofile's mechanisms for VTune,
but Oprofile and VTune do different things in different ways.  For
example,
both tools capture performance data, but Oprofile was designed with
aggregation in mind whereas VTune was designed to collect all the data
and then post-process it.
We are open to putting the VTune driver into the kernel source tree.
However, is consolidation of the performance tools a requirement for 
getting the four additional event notifications into the kernel?
