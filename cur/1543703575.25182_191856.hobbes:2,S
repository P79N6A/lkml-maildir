Subject: [PATCH][2.4] Remove ide bootup noise

Hi Marcelo,
Recently, while syncing my local tree from 2.4.22 to 2.4.25-pre I found 
this little patchlet (back from the 2.4.20 days, AFAIR) that still 
applies and looks pertinent. I believe the original author is Erik 
Andersen, although I can't say for certain since I don't have the 
original email around anymore. Also, I seem to recall that Jens Axboe 
ok'ed it, but for whatever reason it never found its way into mainline.
This will remove the pointless boot message about wether or not the drive 
supports host protected area. Since we don't report any other drive 
capabilities this should go, as it' is just pointless noise. In 2.6 this 
was killed too. Also, this information can be obtained using 'hdparm'.
Please review and apply.
Regards,
		Nuno
