It's most likely bad SMM code in the BIOS that blocks the CPU too long
and is triggered in idle. You can verify that by using idle=poll
(not recommended for production, just for testing) and see if it goes away.
No way to fix this, but you can work around it with very new kernels
by compiling with a lower HZ than 1000.
