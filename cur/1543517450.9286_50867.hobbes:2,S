The udelay_resched(n) macro does not seem to reference "n",
would the following be an acceptable implementation?
#define udelay_resched(n) (\
        {       int i; \
                for (i = 0; i < ((n+9)/10); i++) { \
                        conditional_schedule(); \
                        udelay(10); \
                } \
        })

I have been using the lowlatency-2.2.10-N6B.patch with good results.
I recently installed the 2.2.13 kernel and applied the lowlatency-2.2.13-A1
patch, however the results were not quite as good. The 2.2.10-N6B patch
on the 2.2.10 kernel gave +/-500usec scheduling latencies whereas
the 2.2.13-A1 patch on the kernel gave +/-3msec latencies.  Any idea
why?  These results were obtained on a Pentium III 500MHz.
How were the high latency areas identified? I would be very happy
to help in testing and contributing to this patch.
