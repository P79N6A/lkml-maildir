Other than wanting to stay current, is there a reason why you need to go 
to a newer kernel to do this process? Would it be an option just to run 
on a kernel which works for the moment?
Assuming that you don't want to use these drives unless you can't read a 
CD any other way, would it be practical to (a) move these drives to 
another machine and run and old kernel, (b) try a newer CD (not DVD) 
reader, or (c) install one or both of these antiques in a USB external 
enclosure which would allow you to reinsert the drive rather than reboot?
It may take a while for this problem to be identified, I doubt there are 
many around for developers to test. If I have one in the "old junk" 
closet anyone is welcome to it, but I have donated a lot of built from 
parts machines to various people and causes, so anything that old is 
unlikely to be found.
