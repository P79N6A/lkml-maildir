I don't know if Mike still has problems with SD, but there are now several
interesting reports of SD giving better feedback than CFS on real work. In
my experience, CFS seems smoother on *technical* tests, which I agree that
they do not really simulate real work.
I really think that if we merged SD in 2.6.22, at least we could focus
more on differences between it (which will become mainline) and CFS in
order to improve CFS for later inclusion when mature enough. Or maybe
only relevant parts of CFS will be merged into mainline later. But at
least, testers will not have to patch anymore to report feedback with
SD during -rc, and above all they would not compare anymore against
old-vanilla, thus reducing the number of tests.
Just my 2 cents,
Willy
