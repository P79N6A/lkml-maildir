Well, this is what got us GPLv2.  And the same reasoning is getting us
GPLv3, and it does get hardware manufacturers to think twice instead
of tivoizing hardware.  They can decide between respecting users'
freedoms and encouraging a community of developers around its product,
or they can decide that not letting users change the software is more
important or necessary, and give up the ability to install
modifications without user approval.  If half of the vendors go each
way, we'll get far more contributions in the end, so we're better off.
This is why I think the argument that anti-tivoization won't get us
more "giving back in kind" is irrational and contradictory.

TiVo doesn't have to install ROMs.  It can use the same technical
measures it uses today, then throw away the keys.
Or give the user half of the signing key, or some such.
How bad would this be for them?
