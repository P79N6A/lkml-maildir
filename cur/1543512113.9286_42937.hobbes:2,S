A little playing around reveals that although 2.3.19 will take a
session=# parameter with mount (and will actually read the TOC and
get the correct specs for reading the specified session), it completely
ignores it when it comes to accessing the correct track.  That is,
it gets the right session information and then mounts session 1 anyway.
What gives?
Incidently, it uses that same inode mapping scheme it does for track 1
for all other tracks.  I suspect that this mapping scheme is correct for
the filesystem as long as the filesystem starts at the beginning of the
media.  Not so if the filesystem starts somewhere else.  An offset is
missing?
