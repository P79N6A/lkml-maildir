What I mean is that the driver doesn't have "know" whatever CPU/bus
combo endianness will require it to use "native" or "swapped" access.
What the driver knows is wether the device it tries to access need BE or
LE accessors.

I don't think drivers will benefit from "native" vs. "swapping". Taht
means that pretty much all drivers that care will end up with #ifdef
crap to pick up the right one based on the CPU endian, and some wil get
it wrong of course. No, I _do_ thing that this should be hidden in the
implementation, and we should provide "le" and "be" accessors (le beeing
the current ones, be new ones). Which one swap or not is in the
implementation of those accessors for the architecture, but the driver
shouldn't have to care.
