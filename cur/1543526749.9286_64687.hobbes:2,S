CD drives can be locked , remember ?
Kernel just locks the drive and it's cool.
I believe this is the current behaviour with mounted CDs.
It could be tweaked to unlock the CD-RW when no dirty buffers are
present.
Besides , you can pull the attention of the user by opening/closeng the
tray 
for 10 times :-)
The floppy buz idea was also a half-joke  , something as a last resort,
I didn't seriously expect it to be the default on all linux systems.
