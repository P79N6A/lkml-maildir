This would have the disadvantage that they would need to be always compiled into the
kernel, even though it may not need it. And we already have code bloat problems,
no need to make it worse.
Making them modular also isn't good. Each module takes a 4k page at least, so you
would waste a lot of memory because they're smaller than 4k.
As long as they are not used by anything else it's probably best to keep it 
where they are.
