Subject: [PATCH 16/18] splice: completely document external interface with kerneldoc
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/6/12/53

Also add fs/splice.c as a kerneldoc target with a smaller blurb that
should be expanded to better explain the overview of splice.
