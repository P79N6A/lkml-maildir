That would be nice.  Filesysteem could set intent.open.file->f_mapping
before call to lookup_instantiate_filp(), which would check it before
resetting to inode->i_mapping.

I need this for FUSE, since non-create opens and non-exclusive open of
positive dentry will be done through ->open().
There is an ugly workaround: filesystem sets
nd->intent.open.file->private_data to some non-NULL value before
calling lookup_instantiate_filp() and in ->open() skip open based on
value of file->private_data.
But I'd prefer if lookup_instantiate_filp() would simply not call
->open().

I suggest that nameidata_to_filp() to check this ((flags & O_ACCMODE)
== 3) if the file is already open and bail out with -EINVAL.
This would make sure, that things that relied on the old behavior at
least fail loudly instead of silently.
