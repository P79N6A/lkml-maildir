I tried, but to no avail.  Thanks anyway.

I have some more info now.
Linux 2.2.1, with the ncrc8xx compiled in, gives an Oops like so:
Unable to handle paging request at virtual address fffffff0
current->tss.cr3 = 00101000, %cr3 = 00101000
*pde = 00208067
*pte = 00000000
Oops: 0000
CPU: 2
EIP: 0010:[<801e2fe0>] (this is in ncr_53c8xx_pci_init)
EFLAGS: 00010286
Yes, I changed the page mask, 'cause I have 1GB RAM on this machine.  I also
tried with the original page mask, but things stay the same.
Linux 2.2.2-ac7 gives roughly the same, with EIP also in ncr_53c8xx_pci_init.
Linux 2.2.3 finds no scsi hosts and panics when it cannot mount the root
filesystem.
I'm re-building 2.2.3 with ncr53c8xx as a module and an initrd at the moment. I
have little hope though.
What do you guys think ?  Should I just go buy an Adaptec board ? ;-)
Cheers,
