Is there any reason not to just make the out-of-line version explicit?
i.e.:
	/* in some .h file: */
	static /*(always!)*/inline int my_func(void)
	{
		return FOO;
	}
	extern int OOL_my_func(void);
	/* in some .c file: */
	int OOL_my_func(void)
	{
		return my_func();
	}
It's a little ugly but there really aren't that many cases of this, right?
Or is this just the principal of the thing? :-)
