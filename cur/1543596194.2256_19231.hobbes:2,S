Here's something interesting...
Twice today while I was playing with usbserial/keyspan I got the
following:
     root@glitch[~]# modprobe keyspan
     usbserial.c: ezusb_set_reset_Re254f24d- 1 failed
     keyspan.c: ezusb_writememory failed for Keyspanfirmware (-110 0000 e0b4518d 3)
     usbserial.c: ezusb_set_reset_Re254f24d- 0 failed
Afterwards, not only did the keyspan driver still work, but it was
*much* faster than before.  I was able to perform a full sync with the
Palm in about 15-20 seconds, while it was taking about two minutes
before.
Weird!
