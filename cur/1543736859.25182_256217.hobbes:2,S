This here relies on interrupts working, since to clear IBF you need to
read from the input port, which is only done in the interrupt routine.
What you should do here is to disable the interrupts on the i8042 by
setting the CTR to an appropriate value and then flush the input port
after a response from the keyboard has arrived.

Also, you shouldn't need the DELAY macro, as i8042.c already has the
primitives to do all the waiting.
Something like
	spin_lock_irqsave(&i8042_lock, flags);
	i8042_flush();
	i8042_ctr &= ~I8042_CTR_KBDINT & ~I8042_CTR_AUXINT;
	i8042_command(&i8042_ctr, I8042_CMD_CTL_WCTR);
	i8042_wait_write();
	i8042_write_data(0xed);
	i8042_wait_read();
	i8042_flush();
	i8042_wait_write();
	i8042_write_data(led);
	i8042_wait_read();
	i8042_flush();
	spin_unlock_irqrestore(&i8042_lock, flags);
would be safer and more correct.
