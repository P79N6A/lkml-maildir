Older x86 architectures (386 and before) allow the kernel to write to any
user location regardless of the write-protect bits.
Hence, with this bug, a user program could write to the write-protected
region of its address space by calling the sys_poll system call and
setting the address and data values appropriately.
An example where this could be exploited is an application running
third-party software. The application may want to write-protect its code
region but with this bug, the third party software will be able to
overwrite write-protected regions by calling sys_poll.
