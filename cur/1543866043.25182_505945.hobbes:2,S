I ACK the patch... conditional on some -mm style testing and user ACKs.
Logic:  if there were no downsides to disabling flow control globally, 
the world's networks would have already done so.  Flow control can be 
quite helpful, so I while I understand the errata argument, I also want 
to understand the full effect of this tiny patch.
