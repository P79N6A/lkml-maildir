Good point.
Forget I said that - smp_call_function_single() is calling a function
on a *different* CPU, so data which is local to the calling CPU is of
course in the wrong place.
So if we're going to use per-cpu data then we'd need to protect it with
a lock.  We could (should?) have a separate lock for each destination
CPU.
We could make smp_call_function_single() block until the IPI handler
has consumed the call_single_data, in which case we might as well put
the call_single_data, onto the caller's stack, as you've done.
Or we could take the per-cpu spinlock in smp_call_function_single(),
and release it in the IPI handler, after the call_single_data has been
consumed, which is a bit more efficient.  But I have a suspicion that
this is AB/BA deadlockable.
<tries to think of any scenarios>
<fails>
So we have
smp_call_function_single(int cpu)
{
	spin_lock(per_cpu(cpu, locks));
	per_cpu(cpu, call_single_data) = <stuff>
	send_ipi(cpu);
	return;
}
ipi_handler(...)
{
	int cpu = smp_processor_id();
	call_single_data csd = per_cpu(cpu, call_single_data);
	spin_unlock(per_cpu(cpu, locks));
	use(csd);
}
does that work?
Dunno if it's any better than what you have now.  It does however
remove the unpleasant "try kmalloc and if that failed, try something
else" mess.
