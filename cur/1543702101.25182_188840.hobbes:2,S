Bull.   Having a single process for each autofs filesystem is state in 
itself.   Eg:
- setup an auto_home map on /home
- mkdir /home2
- mount --bind /home /home2
The state that you manage with your automount processes themselves is 
now inconsistent with what the kernel has.

You've completely discarded the fact that a daemon breaks namespaces in 
your argument.
You somehow mistook the arguments I've presented and assume that we get 
rid of the daemon solely so that we eliminate state in userspace.  The 
point of getting rid of the daemon is that tying a single process to 
each mountpoint:
- breaks on mount --bind operations
- breaks on namespace clones
These _can_ be circumvented by using a single process daemon which 
catches _ALL_ automount requests from the kernel, however:
- There are NO facilities for changes namespaces, and there doesn't 
appear to be any plans to implement them.   This doesn't only affect the 
mount operations themselves, but also reading the /etc/auto_* maps in 
the different namespace.
- This limits a running system to _exactly_ one policy system for 
handling automount points.  Differing namespaces may have different 
automounter maps and even automounters themselves if they want to under 
the scheme I've outlined.
Also, the current implementation uses pathnames to do everything.  This 
breaks:
- mountpount binds in another way
- mountpoint moves
My goal here is to fix all of the mountpoint logic in automounting that 
relies on there being a single namespace. 
Now, going back to your argument of reliability and reconnectivity, yes, 
I agree that the daemon dying is something that _SHOULD NOT HAPPEN_.  
But it does in practice.  Getting rid of the daemon the way I've 
outlined simply eliminates that from ever happening as an added bonus.

"Faulty code"?    I haven't even presented you with code yet.  Nice.
Somehow, you got the impression that the system I've proposed would be 
more complex than what we have today, when in fact I believe it's a lot 
simpler.
