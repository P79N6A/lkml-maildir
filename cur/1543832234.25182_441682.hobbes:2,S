Here's a sketch of a possible approach.  Generalizing it and making it 
look pretty are left as exercises for the reader.  :-)
In srcu_struct, along with
	struct srcu_struct_array *per_cpu_ref;
add
	struct percpu_data *per_cpu_table;
Dynamic initialization does:
	sp->per_cpu_ref = NULL;
	sp->per_cpu_table = alloc_percpu(...);
Static initialization does:
	sp->per_cpu_ref = PER_CPU_ADDRESS(...);		/* My macro
		from before; gives the address of the static variable */
	sp->per_cpu_table = (struct percpu_data *)
		~(unsigned long) __per_cpu_offset;
Then the unified_per_cpu_ptr(ref, table, cpu) macro would expand to
something like this:
({
	struct percpu_data *t = (struct percpu_data *)~(unsigned long)(table);
	RELOC_HIDE(ref, t->ptrs[cpu]);
})
Making this work right would of course require knowledge of the intimate
details of both include/linux/percpu.h and include/asmXXX/percpu.h.  
There's some ambiguity about what t above points to: a structure
containing an array of pointers to void, or an array of unsigned longs.  
Fortunately I think it doesn't matter.
Doing it this way would not incur any extra cache misses, except for the 
need to store an extra member in srcu_struct.

That is certainly a viable approach: just force everyone to use dynamic 
initialization.  Changes to existing code would be relatively few.
I'm not sure where the right place would be to add these initialization 
calls.  After kmalloc is working but before the relevant notifier chains 
get used at all.  Is there such a place?  I guess it depends on which 
notifier chains we convert.
We might want to leave some chains using the existing rw-semaphore API.  
It's more appropriate when there's a high frequency of write-locking
(i.e., things registering or unregistering on the notifier chain).  The 
SRCU approach is more appropriate when the chain is called a lot and 
needs to have low overhead, but (un)registration is uncommon.  Matt's task 
notifiers are a good example.
