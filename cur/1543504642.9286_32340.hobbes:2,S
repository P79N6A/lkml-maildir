Hi,
    I've applied the International kernel patches for 2.2.10 but after
rebuilding losetup, I can't seem to mount a device correctly. Here's the
output:
[root@periscope util-linux-2.9s]# losetup -e rc6 /dev/hdb4 /dev/loop0
Password :
ioctl: LOOP_SET_FD: Input/output error
[root@periscope util-linux-2.9s]#
I haven't previously set a password. Should I have set a password using
something else first? Any Ideas?
Thanks.
