The benchmarks in the fftw.org libraries are useful only as
time-sinks. At least on ix86, our tests show that a generic
fft, perhaps 10 years old, with no special treatment except
using pointers instead of indexes, when using 'double' as
float, is, within the test noise, as fast as their "self-
adapting" fft.
Also, the nature of a fft, reduces the influence of the kernel.
Even with some kind of parallelism, for which there is little
chance because of the serial nature of a fft, you are testing
threads, not the kernel. To the kernel, a fft is just some
CPU bound math.
If you are going to do a lot of math simulation and are not
going to be creating a lot of separate tasks that communicate,
your choice of kernel (or operating system) is irrelevant.
This kind of math-code just sits in user's memory plugging
along until it writes its results to something, somewhere.
The kernel is not involved until the answers are available.
Cheers,
