Still the wrong question, since all we're arguing here is the language,  
not the debug info content.
How about this:
	"Fatal Exception 0E at address 020a34ff"
 Or
	"Something fucked up.  This shouldn't happen."
	"code=0E EIP=020a34ff"

"In recent years" as opposed to "in school"? What other languages did he  
learn before English and after Gaelic?
If the answer turns out to be "none", I'll be extremely skeptical about  
that account.

Well, English certainly isn't my native language (German is), but anyone  
who has serious contact with English speakers will certainly know what  
"fucked up" means. (That's how I know.)
