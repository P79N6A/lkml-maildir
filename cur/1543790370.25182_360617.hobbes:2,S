Ok - that helps.  Thanks.
There is also an hg (mercurial) web based Linux history at:
  
http://www.kernel.org/hg/linux-2.6/
I still don't see something I can download into a local
hg or git repository -- if a lurker knows how that is done,
I'd be glad to know.

Yeah - agreed.  The include/linux/cpumask.h stuff hardcodes
the UP (NR_CPUS==1) code to plain old 0's and 1's.  This
macro should do so as well.
I just sent a patch.
