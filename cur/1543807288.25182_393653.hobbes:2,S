The LGPL deals with only derivative works. The GPL also deals with mere 
*linking*. If glibc were GPL'd, it would be illegal to make an OS based on it 
with a single C program incompatible with the GPL.

The 'code that interfaces the binary blob with the kernel' would then be 
illegal, because the code cannot be both GPL and proprietary. If the code is 
GPL and acceptable for kernel-linking, then under the terms of the GPL, the 
code cannot link to a GPL-incompatible binary blob.
