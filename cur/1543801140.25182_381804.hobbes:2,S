Well, if the generic one generates _buggy_ code on ppc64, that means that 
either the generic version is buggy, or one of the atomics that it uses is 
buggily implemented on ppc64.
And I think it's the generic mutex stuff that is buggy. It seems to assume 
memory barriers that aren't valid to assume.
A mutex is more than just updating the mutex count properly. You also have 
to have the proper memory barriers there to make sure that the things that 
the mutex _protects_ actually stay inside the mutex.
So while a ppc64-optimized mutex is probably a good idea per se, I think 
the generic mutex code had better be fixed first and regardless of any 
optimized version.
On x86/x86-64, the locked instructions automatically imply the proper 
memory barriers, but that was just lucky, I think.
