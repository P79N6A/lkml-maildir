Try a 72x cdrom sometime. Yes they do exist.

I never said the Intel 440bx chipset is flawed. I said the VIA
VP3/MVP3/MVP4 is flawed. 440bx is fine AFAIK.

This is irrelevant if the controller cant run DMA (eg promise u66).

Lots. All VIA VP3/MVP3/MVP4 boards for example. This is a large percentage
of boards now shipping, especially asia
