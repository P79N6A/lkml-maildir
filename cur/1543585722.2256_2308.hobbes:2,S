Hello!
   2.4.x kernel. have not tried 2.2
   I just found somethig, I believe is kernel bug.
   I am working with usbnet.c driver, which stores some of its
   internal state in sk_buff.cb area. But once such skb passed to
   upper layer with netif_rx, net/ipv4/ip_input.c reuses content of cb
   (line #345), and all packets that should go outside of beyond hosts
   we have direct routes to, fails, because we think, they have source routing
   enabled.
   For now I workarounded it with filling skb->cb with zeroes before
   netif_rx(), but I believe it is a kludge and networking layer should be fixed
   instead.
   Thank you.
Bye,
    Oleg
