Surely someone can decode the BIOS of an nforce user that is now ok
after a BIOS update?.

Whenthis thread first(?) started way back when in Nov or Dec last year I
was pretty happy.. no lockups until the 5th day. so what does "My
Shuttle AN35N nforce2 board can run vanilla kernels with the 12-5-2003
dated bios version and not lock up." mean?
Ross's v3 patches for 2.6/2.61 are still running well here on 2.6.1. I'm
waiting for work to settle down before trying his new ones.
