Hi Linus, Andrew,
Would you have any objection to task-group specific stuff being split from the
task_struct and placed into a refcounted structure of its own and shared upon
CLONE_THREAD.
The fields I'm thinking of include:
	struct linux_binfmt *binfmt
	unsigned long personality
	pid_t tgid
	struct task_struct *group_leader
	u32 parent_exec_id;
   	u32 self_exec_id;
Should process credentials be shared?
I could then add the process/session keyring pointers from my patch to it too.
David
