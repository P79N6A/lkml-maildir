Subject: [PATCH 1/6] SELinux: change Kconfig to use select instead of depends
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/10/9/273

From: Eric Paris <eparis@redhat.com>
Changes the security/selinux/Kconfig to use select instead of depends
for most of the SELinux requirements.  This allows the SELinux option to
show up when people do a make config without already knowing they had to
enable audit and other non-obvious choices.  Added a depends on SECURITY
(which previously existed through SECURITY_NETWORK) so that SELinux
would not always show up, but would be easy and intuitive to find.
