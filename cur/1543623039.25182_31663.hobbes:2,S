 A nice spotting.  However what you describe is only a side effect of the
bug, which is the IRQ is kept registered at the wrong pin.  It's only
because the timer is special and it's edge-triggered it remained unnoticed
for so long.
 I propose the following patch.  Instead of adding the new pin to the IRQ
0 registry unconditionally, it replaces the already registered pin if one
exists, otherwise it adds the new one.  The reason is to remove the
reference to the old pin, which may be connected to an unknown device or
simply dangling and weird things may happen if it ever gets unmasked. 
There is also a small performance impact of keeping two pins registered
for a single IRQ.
 I don't know if the changes are relevant to your system as you haven't
sent the relevant fragment of a bootstrap log from your system.  They
affect all systems that have a bogus IRQ 0 entry in the MP table.  For
other systems the patch is equivalent to yours.  Please test it if it
works for you as I don't have a suitable system with IRQ 0 unconnected
(I've been able to verify it builds only).  Everyone with such a system is
invited to test the patch as well.
 If results are positive, the patch will be submitted as is for inclusion
into 2.4 and 2.5.
