This is one of those things which can give any result depending on the
measurement. For kernel compiles I might see a 5-30% reduction in clock
time, for threaded applications like web/mail/news not much, and for
applications which communicate via shared memory up to 50% because some
blocking system calls can be avoided and cache impact is lower.
In general I have to agree with the "too big," but I haven't seen any
indication that the hole can be exploited without being able to run a
custom application on the machine, so for single users machines and
servers the risk level seems low.
