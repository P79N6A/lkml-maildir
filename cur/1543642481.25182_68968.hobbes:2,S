   So, any comments I made which might have implied that Tux/Tux2 made things
   worse have no substantiated data to prove that and it is quite possible
   that there is no such problem.  Also, this was run nearly a year ago and
   the state of Tux/Tux2 might have been a bit different at the time.
Thanks for clearing things up.
