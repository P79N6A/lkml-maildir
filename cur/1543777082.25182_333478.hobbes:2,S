Yes, do look at that.  From the latest 2.6 sources:
	timeo = sock_sndtimeo(sk, flags & O_NONBLOCK);
	if ((1 << sk->sk_state) & (TCPF_SYN_SENT | TCPF_SYN_RECV)) {
		/* Error code is set above */
		if (!timeo || !inet_wait_for_connect(sk, timeo))
			goto out;
		err = sock_intr_errno(timeo);
		if (signal_pending(current))
			goto out;
	}
If the socket is non-blocking, then we don't call
inet_wiat_for_connect(), yes.  But sock_intr_errno() will set the
error code to -EINTR if the socket is set to non-nonblocking (see
include/net/sock.h), and if a signal is pending, return it.
