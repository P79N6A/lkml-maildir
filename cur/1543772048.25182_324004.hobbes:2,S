It is loaded by request_firmware() during initialization of the adapter.
That doesn't work, as at that time no hotplug binary can be executed (we
are talking about ipw2100 built in the kernel, not built as a module).

It sounds very dangerous to me.

No. Driver should request the firmware when it is told to perform a scan.

Firmware can be loaded automatically by the driver when there is some
request from userspace and the firmware has not been loaded yet.
