Which is the cause of the current deadlock.  But if we allow
filesystem A to go into the red just a little, the deadlock is
avoided, because it can continue to make progress with cleaning the
dirtyness produced by B.
The maximum that filesystems can go over the limit will be
  (16 + epsilon) * number-of-queues
This is usually insignificant compared to the limit itself (~2000
pages on a machine with 32MB)
However with thousands of fuse mounts this may become a problem, as
each filesystem gets a separate queue.  In theory, just 2 pages are
enough to always make progress, but current dirty balancing can't
enforce this, as the ratelimit is at least 8 pages.
So there may have to be some more strict page accounting within fuse
itself, but that doesn't change the overall concept I think.
