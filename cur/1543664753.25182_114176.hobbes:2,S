Is it an IDE drive or a SCSI drive? If it's IDE, check out `hdparm`.
In other words, execute:
	man hdparm
There are lots of parameters to be set. Most likely, your drive
defaulted to some DMA setting it really can't handle. Check it out,
first, then contact the Red-Hat people because they got paid for
suppling your distribution. The Linux-kernel list isn't really
the place to inquire so don't be surprised if you are ignored.
