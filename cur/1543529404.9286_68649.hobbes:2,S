Well, three more ideas. Before running 'make *Image' but after running
oldconfig in the above example check for the following:
1) check for NETFILTER_DEBUG in your .config file, it should look like
this:
	[adam@pepsi linux]$ grep NETFILTER_DEBUG .config
	# CONFIG_NETFILTER_DEBUG is not set
2) check the include/linux/autconf.h file 
	[adam@pepsi linux]$ grep NETFILTER_DEBUG include/linux/autoconf.h 
	#undef  CONFIG_NETFILTER_DEBUG
3) as final check you might want see what the actual o file contains. The
first one below is compiled with CONFIG_NETFILTER_DEBUG enabled the second
one is compiled with the said "feature" disabled.
[adam@pepsi linux ]$ nm net/core/netfilter.o  | grep debug
00000338 t debug_print_hooks_ip
000005dc T nf_debug_ip_finish_output2
00000528 T nf_debug_ip_local_deliver
000005a0 T nf_debug_ip_loopback_xmit
[adam@pepsi linux ]$ nm net/core/netfilter.o  | grep debug
[adam@pepsi linux ]$
