Hello,
The following problems have been reported before by myself. Is
anyone working on them? If not, I might be able to set up a terminal
as a virtual console and capture OOPs data, but if someone is already
working on this, it would waste a lot of time for nothing. Although
I am now wasting a lot of time because I tried to run Linux-2.3.39
and trashed my file-systems.
Linux-2.3.39	Can't boot into an initial ram-disk.
		OOPs when accessing initial ram-disk. Can't
		get info because it's overwritten and rapidly scrolls
		off the screen with watchdog-timer Oops-en.
		Boots fine if I don't use initial ramdisk support
		(necessary for my project), but e2fsck finds many
		things "wrong" with all file-systems (aic7xxx SCSI).
		If I don't let e2fsck touch the file-systems, and reboot
		into 2.3.36, e2fsck finds nothing wrong. If I do let
		e2fsck "fix" the file systems, they are destroyed.
		I am restoring everything from last night's tapes at
		this time. This machine is running 2.1.3. I changed
		its name/IP  while I'm rebuilding my usual machine.
Linux-2.3.38	Can't boot into an initial ram-disk.
		Same problem as above except I didn't attempt to
		boot it without initrd support and didn't destroy
		anything.
Linux-2.3.36	Will boot into an initial ram-disk, but can't make one
		because the loop device is broken.
		mount -o loop <file> works only once per boot. The
		memory image of /dev/loop0 is not invalidated once
		the device is closed. This makes subsequent use
		contain the (incorrect) data from a previous use.
		Floppy disk memory image is not invalidated when the
		device is unmounted. This makes a copy of the raw
		device image wrong.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
