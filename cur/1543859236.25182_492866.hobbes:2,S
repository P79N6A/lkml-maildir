Think of "PnP geometry" supported by all nowadays drives.
It's 255 heads, 63 sectors per track, and whatever number of cylinders.
You start cfdisk (sorry don't remember options for other *fdisk) like this,
on an empty disk:
  cfdisk -H 255 -S 63 /dev/sda
And after creating the partition table, kernel switches to this "PnP geometry"
mode automatically.
So regardless of how many actual heads or sectors your HDD has, it will always
work the same way.
