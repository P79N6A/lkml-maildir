Dear All,
I just curious (since I haven't tried this), what happened to linux (the
kernel especially), when a Linux Box has for example 100 access lists,
500 access lists, 1000 access lists, etc ?
Will I see a process consuming 100% of CPU Resources, or people will
feeling much slower when they are accessing my server, or the box starts
dropping some packets ?
(what I meant access lists is the TCP filtering managed thru ipchains,
iptables, etc.)
