Of course, this way looks preferable, but sometimes maybe too costly,
especially with some complex systems. Actually, I don't even think
this have to be fully (production ready) implemented or workable.
Probably there would be even enough to maintain some simplified kind
of test checking how current kernel changes could affect such a system,
and how new versions of this system are better, BTW.
