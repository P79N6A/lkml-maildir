I'd probably apply them to 2.4.7 based trees as they have more history so
you can meaningfully answer the reliability question in statistical terms.
The others are too new to be 100% sure.
Also for remote systems configure watchdog support. That'll get you out of
so many disasters, software, hardware or other that its a godsend
