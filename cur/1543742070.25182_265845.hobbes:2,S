Ok - that's a deadlock.

That's not surprising: the full debug code is only active for 
uniprocessor kernels. On SMP, only a simple check for unitialized 
spinlocks is performed.
Btw, I'd use
    printk("thread %d, struct %p: taking lock", current->pid, info);
Then you are certain that you are not fooled by multiple concurrent 
operations.

I must think about it. Who's printed as the last owner that released the 
lock? Perhaps there is a race with segment destruction: The structures 
are protected by RCU.
Could you enable debug spinlocks and slab debugging? I would have 
expected an error message from spinlock debugging due to bad magic.
