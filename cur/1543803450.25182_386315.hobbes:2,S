We are actually moving NM on top of wpa_supplicant for the actual
connection process.  So essentially, while NM does talk to the card for
information and scanning, wpa_supplicant provides the bulk of the actual
connection process control.  Any card that works with wpa_supplicant
should then work with NetworkManager.
Novel's is working on a KDE applet for NM which should hit CVS soon, I
think.
