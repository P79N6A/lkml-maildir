If interrupts are disabled, where is this distant implicit call from
resched_task() coming from?
That was my point, aside from interrupt handlers all the
need_resched-touching code is in sched.c and both Ingo and I verified
everything is locked.
If interrupts are disabled, there are no interrupts handlers.  And if
you are in an interrupt handler, preemption is already disabled.
