It doesn't have to be closely coupled with the load balancer to does 
this.  It just needs to know where the trigger is.

That's the load balancer's job and even if you use dynamic priority for 
load balancing it still wouldn't need to be closely coupled.  The load 
balancer would just need to know how to find a process's dynamic priority.
In fact, in the current set up, the load balancer decides how much load 
needs to be moved based on the static load on the CPUs but uses dynamic 
priority (to a large degree) to decide which ones to move.  This is due 
more to computational efficiency considerations than any deliberate 
design (I suspect) as the fact that tasks are stored on the runqueue in 
dynamic priority order makes looking at processes in dynamic priority 
order is the most efficient strategy.
