Hi Alan,
OK here is a case I have just come across. Client is an iMac running Open 
Transport 2.5.1.
AppleTalk address of the client as reported in the AppleTalk control panel
is 12.229. MAC address of the client is 00 0A 27 7C C3 DA.
Server yields the following information:
frank:~> cat /proc/net/aarp|grep 229
    12:229  eth0      00:50:E4:E6:1D:58  4170563584      25743511   resolved
I am pretty certain that there is no other machine on the network with MAC
address 00:50:E4:E6:1D:58 since the address does not appear in any
arp/aarp table or in the switch address tables.
As usual TCP-IP works correctly. /proc/net/arp shows the correct info.
The client in question has no problem talking to other AppleTalk devices
on the network.
Let me know if there is anything further I can do.
For reference here is a dump of the whole of /proc/net/aarp:
