Allright, thanks. I was mostly trying to figure out where we standed
with this whole idea that driver additions were not necessarily
constrainted by the merge window (which I think is fair to do) and this
looked like a good example to pick since it affects my new laptop :-)
Out of curiosity, what's the main source of opposition ? Since it's
being shipped by distro or built out of tree by most users -anyway-, I
think it's pretty clear that we'd be better off having it merged asap
rather than trying to figure out what random version was included by
users/distros and try to support it, in addition to wider exposure & all
the yadada of being upstream in the first place.
Ben.
