And if there is something GPT doesn't do then there is Veritas LDM (also 
used in simplified form by Windows LDM) and the kernel understands it 
today. Admittedly none of the Linux partitioning tools support it yet but 
that is subject to change. (-; LDM is journalled, supports large numbers of 
disks, huge disks, all sorts of RAID, etc... I don't think you will find 
anything missing in that one...
So I fully agree that inventing yet another partitioning scheme is silly in 
view of the multitude of existing ones which do the job just fine. Feel 
free to prove me I am wrong by showing me something that GPT/LDM can't do...
Best regards,
