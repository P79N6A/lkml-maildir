   Just press ^C to stop this loop:
   while true; do (cat /dev/tty > /dev/null &); done
   (I tried this at the console).
Umm....  I get "cat: /dev/tty: Input/output error" repeated many times.
No lock up.....
   BTW: There is a security issue related to rebooting
   without syncing disks: unflushed files will contain
   garbage, and this garbage can be some data the owner
   of the file should not see. Eventually, kernel
   bugs etc. can be (potentially) used to gain access
   to unused portions of the disk. (I know, one should
   use chattr +s, but maybe this is not necessary?)
You shouldn't be rebooting without doing a clean shutdown.
Yes, it's possible that a kernel bug which crashes the system might
potentially cause someone to get access to a deleted file; but then
again, bugs which can cause an unprivileged user to force the system to
crash are security issues, and are treated as such.
