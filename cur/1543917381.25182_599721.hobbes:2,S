As a shameless plug, biosdevname is a userspace app I wrote to help
solve this so we don't need to patch the kernel for future systems.
It's not integrated into any distributions properly yet, but is
included in openSUSE 10.3 and Fedora 8 for people who want to download
and install it there.  It acts as a udev helper.
For the time being, patching the kernel is necessary.  I really hope
biosdevname eliminates that need in future distributions.
