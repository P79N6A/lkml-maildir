 setting fs readahead to 512

 readahead    =  8 (on)

Probably for reasons like that.  For some reason, I can't set my ICH4
based controller(ASUS P4B533) and Quantum Fireball AS40.0 to more than
255.  Kernel is 2.4.21
Or I'm missing more of this thread than I thought and I'm completely off
topic here!
(i'm guessing the latter)
