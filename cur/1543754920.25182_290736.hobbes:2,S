Havent debugged that one, yet. Hopefully a different issue. According to
the logs from 2.6.5, the next message would be 
NET: Registered protocol family 2
IP: routing cache hash table of 2048 buckets, 16Kbytes
TCP established hash table entries: 16384 (order: 5, 131072 bytes)
TCP bind hash table entries: 16384 (order: 4, 65536 bytes)
