Subject: 2.2.19pre6 change in /proc behavior
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Let's say a normal user has started a process with pid =
12345. /proc/12345 owner and group is the same as the user but
/proc/12345/* are all owned by root so the normal user can't read most
of the entries there. In 2.2.18 everything is owned by the user.
Is this supposed to be happening?
Thanks.
