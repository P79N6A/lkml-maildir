Seems a bit restrictive to me. After all Unix is not an 
ossified standard! :)
Assuming clone() actually page table shares the vm covered 
by a mmap(MAP_PRIVATE) in the way I want, it isn't much to 
ask to be more *restrictive* on sharing?
So far, it's looking as if my ideal is unattainable with the 
current kernel.
Anyone disagree?
