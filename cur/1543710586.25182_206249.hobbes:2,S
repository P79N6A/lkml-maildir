I doubt if there's any motivation to fix these things in 2.4.  If you change
HZ in 2.4 you own both pieces.  (alpha has HZ=1024 in 2.4, so presumably
bdflush tuning doesn't work right).
In 2.6, the bdflush parameters do not exist.  They were replaced by
/proc/sys/vm/*_centisecs, which are HZ-independent.
There are, I think, still some /proc tunables in 2.6 which do depend upon
HZ and they should be found and fixed.  If the same tunables are present in
2.4 kernels then they should be converted to take centiseconds in 2.6, so
2.4-based tools continue to work correctly.
We have similar problems where /proc tunables are expressed in terms of
"number of pages".  As PAGE_SIZE varies from 4096 to 65536 this is
sometimes wrong.  Fixing this is more subtle.
