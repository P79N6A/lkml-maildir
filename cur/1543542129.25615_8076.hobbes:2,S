Ehrmm...
Let's see (this is from the v2.4-test tree, not v2.2.xx):
ntfs
hpfs
ext2(fs)
qnx4(fs)
ramfs
romfs
umsdos
vfat
sysv(fs)
coda
adfs
affs
cramfs
isofs
jffs
ncpfs
Not to be picky, but I'd say there are more 4-letter abbrevations than
three letter abbr's.
befs (not beos; the fs should be there to stress that it is a filesystem)
is a good name I think. beosfs might be a good name too.

Well, it's nice to hear you're working on it.
