Subject: [PATCH] [28/35] x86: Drop cc-options call for all options supported in gcc 3.2+
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/4/28/241

The kernel only supports gcc 3.2+ now so it doesn't make sense
anymore to explicitely check for options this compiler version
already has.
This actually fixes a bug. The -mprefered-stack-boundary check
never worked because gcc rightly complains
  CC      arch/i386/kernel/asm-offsets.s
cc1: -mpreferred-stack-boundary=2 is not between 4 and 12
We just never saw the error because of cc-options.
I changed it to 4 to actually work.
Tested by compiling i386 and x86-64 defconfig with gcc 3.2.
Should speed up the build time a tiny bit and improve
stack usage on i386 slightly.
