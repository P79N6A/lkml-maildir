If I understand right you shouldn't unpin the page if you are not sure that
all waiters for a specific (page,offset)-combination are woken up and deleted
from the waitqueue. Otherwise a second call to futex_wake may look on the wrong
hash_queue or wake the wrong waiters.
In general, I think fast userspace synchronization primitives and asynchronous 
notification are different enough to keep them logically more separated. 
Your double use of the hashed wait queues and sys_call make the code difficult
to grasp and thus open for subtle error.
