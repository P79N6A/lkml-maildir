I think more than one per card model. Other Kworld Card have different
remote than mine, as you can see on my homepage, my lircd.conf isn't one
of the ones in lirc remotes list.

But I can't take a new tv card, plug it into my machine, start up,
configure the remote, and use xine.
Also, from user apps dev view, I think is more difficult to check for
input events knowing that every remote has different buttons, instead of
configure the .lircrc and use lirc_client for receive directly
software-commands.
We can drop /dev/lirc*, and use input events with received codes, but I
think that lircd is still needed to translate them into userland
commands...
