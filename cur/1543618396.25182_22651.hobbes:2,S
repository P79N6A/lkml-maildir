yes, I use suse 7.2 with updated modutils and kernel to 2.4.17 ( from
unofficial suse rpm produced by suse ) and I'm using suse7.3's hotplug
with ieee1394.agent that I got through the hotplug cvs server
maybe to chemical :)
I think that anyway we should prevent this happens if it's possible.
( I didn't lost any data since I tested with some spare disk ).
I can also put a umount in my ieee1394.agent, I thought about it and
probably will do it.
