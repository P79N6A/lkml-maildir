Herbert,
Please stop seeding, hmm, falseness. OpenVZ patches you mention are 
against 2.6.8 kernel, thus they contain tons of backported mainstream 
bugfixes and driver updates; so, most of this size is not 
virtualization, but general security/stability/drivers stuff. And yes, 
that size also indirectly tells how much work we do to keep our users happy.
Back to the topic. If you (or somebody else) wants to see the real size 
of things, take a look at broken-out patch set, available from
http://download.openvz.org/kernel/broken-out/.
 Here (2.6.15-025stab014.1 
kernel) we see that it all boils down to:
Virtualization stuff:                    diff-vemix-20060120-core   817K
Resource management (User Beancounters): diff-ubc-20060120          377K
Two-level disk quota:                    diff-vzdq-20051219-2       154K
