My opinion is to fork 2.7 pretty soon and to allow into 2.6 only the 
amount of changes that were allowed into 2.4 after 2.5 forked.
Looking at 2.4, this seems to be a promising model.

This is only one source of problems, that increases with the amount of 
changes and decreases with the amount of review.
Another source is the interaction of correct patches with other code. An 
example are (were?) the problems with 4kB stacks on i386 with XFS.
And then there are issues that are not bugs in the code, but user errors 
that have to be avoided. An example is CONFIG_BLK_DEV_UB in 2.6.9, which 
even the Debian kernel maintainers got wrong in the first kernel 
packages they did put into Debian unstable.
