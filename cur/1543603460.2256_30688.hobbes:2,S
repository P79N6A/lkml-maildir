Note that the kernel will refuse to honour MAP_DENYWRITE from user
space, so I'm afraid that changing ld.so won't do a thing.
The reason the kernel refuses to honour it, is that MAP_DENYWRITE is an
excellent DoS-vehicle - you just mmap("/etc/passwd") with MAP_DENYWRITE,
and even root cannot write to it.. Vary nasty.
Which is why the kernel only allows it when the binary loader itself
sets the flag, because security-conscious application writers are
already aware of the "oh, a running binary may not be writable" issues.
So sorry..
