Well, Alan said the same thing, and I went and checked - the macros existed
since 2.1.106, probably the last time there was a "jiffies wrap" effort.  It
is more likely that nobody knows about them, because nobody uses them, 
because nobody knows about them, etc.

If people don't want to see them, that is fine with me - they will stop.
Tim and I were only trying to fix instability that he noticed when
initializing jiffies to some large pre-wrap value.  If people are OK
with 2.4 Linux boxes hanging after 497 days, that is fine with me.
The only box I have that could stay up that long is my router (486/33),
and it does not have a UPS so it is not likely to actually make it
(record is 6 months or so).
Cheers, Andreas
