This is the setup I am using ON host 10.0.0.216 itself:
# AH
add 1.2.3.4 10.0.0.216 ah 25700 -A hmac-md5 "1234567890123456";
add 10.0.0.216 1.2.3.4 ah 34500 -A hmac-md5 "1234567890123456";
# ESP
add 1.2.3.4 10.0.0.216 esp 25701 -E 3des-cbc "123456789012123456789012";
add 10.0.0.216 1.2.3.4 esp 34501 -E 3des-cbc "123456789012123456789012";
spdadd 10.0.0.0/24 1.2.3.0/24 any -P out ipsec
           esp/tunnel/1.2.3.4-10.0.0.216/require;
If I now ping 1.2.3.4, I see the packet go out on the wire unencrypted.
If I ping from 10.0.0.11 with a route to 1.2.3.0/24 to the ipsec host
10.0.0.216, I get an ICMP redirect.
Oh, by the way, my lowly pentiumpro200 manages to crypt *6 megabits/second*
with 3des-cbc! The box does get a bit slowish over the network then though.

bert
