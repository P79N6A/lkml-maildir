This isn't right. TuxOnIce has no problem with image sizes exceeding half the 
amount of memory, and both uswsusp and TuxOnIce could write to a USB disk/key 
or NFS as well. Historically, the issue with writing to USB devices has been 
an issue with USB device drivers, not hibernation implementations. I haven't 
tried writing an image to USB, but with the work on the drivers, I wouldn't 
be surprised if it was usable now. NFS? Again, I haven't tried, but wouldn't 
expect it to be impossible. I did try writing an image to an NBD device a 
couple of years ago. It didn't quite work, but wasn't far away.

Nigel
