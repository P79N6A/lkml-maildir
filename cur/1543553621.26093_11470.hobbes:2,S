Ughh!  That is definitely abusing the inter_module functions.  If we
need persistent module storage then we should add a clean interface to
do it instead of using kmalloc and overloading inter_module_xxx.
What do people think, do we need module persistent storage?  There are
already entries in struct module for persistent data but there is no
way of setting those fields, nor is there any code in modutils to
handle persistent storage.  This will probably be a 2.5 change but I
want to get an idea of the requirements before coding anything.
