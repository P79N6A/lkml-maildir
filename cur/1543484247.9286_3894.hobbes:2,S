I'm wondering. Should not arch/i386/Makefile be changed so that it includes
something like this?
ifdef CONFIG_M686FX
CFLAGS := $(CFLAGS) -malign-loops=2 -malign-jumps=2 -malign-functions=2 -DCPU=686
endif
Or am I just off my nut? It just strikes me as puzzling is all.
And no, that's not a patch or anything. It's prolly totally wrong but
it's something I spotted and am pondering as I have the right type
of CPU for this patch to test on. Also, I'm currently compiling with
that on jsut to see if it'll blow up in my face or whatever.
