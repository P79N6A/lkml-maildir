So you can insmod hello_module.ko successfully now?
Sure, 2.6 supports external modules (if you mean modules that are
built outside of the kernel source tree), but for now you also
need a full kernel source tree for the build system to reference.
I.e., you can't build an external module without having a full
kernel source tree installed and configured.
