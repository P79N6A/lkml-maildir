Are you still suffering from this problem?
I'm seeing exactly the same issue on many boxes (including
kernel-2.6.16). (See my tests and the corresponding test-script at [1].)
Are you using Software-Suspend? I am able to trigger the problem after
suspending to disk and resuming (swsuspend2). However, it does also
happen on some boxes with a stock fedora kernel and without suspending,
though it is hard to reproduce on those boxes. (But once it is
triggered, it doesn't go away anymore.)
On most machines that show the problem, buffers are flushed only based
on the amount of dirty memory (dirty_ratio and dirty_background_ratio)
or when doing a "sync", they are not periodically flushed anymore.
There is one box where even "sync" does only flush a fraction of the
dirty buffers [2].
I am not using vmware, no laptop_mode and no custom /proc/sys/vm/dirty*
settings are involved.
Cheers,
