In it's early beginnings, Linux was IA32 based. A pretty cool idea at 
the time. The patent took ten years to issue due to all the prior
art claims. I remember Novell's lawyers bringing me reams of prior art 
to review during the initial work to verify there was no prior
art in the field. Apparently, this was for first affinity patent on SMP 
architecture systems filed, or it would not have issued. Anyway, I 
provided it as a reference since it is the first patent on SMP affinity 
scheduling and methods for the very interested person who asked. And 
yes, Linux
appears to infringe it, but since Novell is pro-Linux, I don't think it 
matters.
