That is true, but I've got one question about it.  When UCB
dropped clause (3), is it across the board for all existing BSD
licensed software?  In other words, if I take BSD source that
contains the clause, can I now ignore it completely?  I've wanted
to create some specific Linux software under GPL license *ONLY*
for a while now, but didn't want to start from scratch.  The only
pre-existing code I could find was BSD licensed (bsdgames), and
as such I couldn't use GPL so I wasn't interested.  I tried to
track down the authors of the code, but nobody responded so I
gave up.
Can I now use the new BSD license without the clause, or would
the authors of the software need to make a new release with the
modified license?  In particular the package is bsd-games as
stated above.  If I can now use that code in a fully GPL product,
I'd like to do so.
Any help appreciated.
Take care,
TTYL
