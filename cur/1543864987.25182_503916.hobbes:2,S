Yep, i'm sure config and binary is OK.

I think i found the cause of the problem, initramfs can't handle hardlinks 
anymore (which works with 2.6.18), copying same /sbin/busybox binary with 
different names into initramfs (which ends ups with 50 MB image) or using 
symbolic ones instead of hards seems works.
