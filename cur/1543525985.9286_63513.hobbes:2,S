Hi all,
I have noticed that in include/linux/netdevice.h., in the structure
net_device the following variables disappeared after kernel version
2.3.42
        volatile unsigned char  start;          /* start an operation  
*/
        unsigned long           interrupt;      /* bitops.. */
        unsigned long           tbusy;          /* transmitter busy */
my question:
is it a design change, and if so, how should one deal with e piece of
code (e.g. vmware module) which contains something like that:
   dev->tbusy = 0;
   dev->interrupt = 0;
   dev->start = 1;
 
where dev is a net_device structure.
