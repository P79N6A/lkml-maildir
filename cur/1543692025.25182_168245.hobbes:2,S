Subject: 2.6.0-test broke RPM 4.2 on Red Hat 9 in a VERY weird way

I've just discovered a very strange and unusual problem with rpm on my Red Hat 9
laptop running 2.6.0-test. Under 2.4.22-ac2 rpm runs perfectly fine, but when I
run it under 2.6.0-test, it outputs the following errors:
sudo rpm -Uvh alsa-driver-0.9.6-1.fr.i386.rpm
Password:
rpmdb: unable to join the environment
error: db4 error(11) from dbenv->open: Resource temporarily unavailable
error: cannot open Packages index using db3 - Resource temporarily unavailable (11)
error: cannot open Packages database in /var/lib/rpm
warning: alsa-driver-0.9.6-1.fr.i386.rpm: V3 DSA signature: NOKEY, key ID e42d547b
rpmdb: unable to join the environment
error: db4 error(11) from dbenv->open: Resource temporarily unavailable
error: cannot open Packages database in /var/lib/rpm
rpmdb: unable to join the environment
error: db4 error(11) from dbenv->open: Resource temporarily unavailable

I have never seen rpm do this before, and it only occurs under 2.6.0-test. It
happens under these specific kernels:
2.6.0-test5-bk10
2.6.0-test5-bk11
2.6.0-test5-mm4
I have not tried -test5-bk12 yet, but I have a feeling that I will get the same
errors. I have checked syslog and dmesg and there are no errors from the kernel;
under 2.4.22-ac2 rpm works perfectly fine, so I don't believe it's file corruption
or filesystem breakage.
Does anyone have any ideas that I can try?
Thanks!
Brad
