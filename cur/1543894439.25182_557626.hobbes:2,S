Doesn't matter at all. GPLv3 requires that any project incorporating GPLv3 
code be licensed under the GPLv3. Linus is, as he has shown, intelligent 
enough to know this. The *second* he actually accepted GPLv3 code into the 
kernel it would either be "change the license or start getting lawsuits for 
breach of the terms of the GPLv3".

You are making a distinction between "part" and "whole". When separate from 
the kernel the code can have whatever restrictions the creator pleases. If he 
has said "I want this in the "official" Linux Kernel" (ie: I want this in 
Linus' Linux Kernel source tree) then the creator of the code has stated a 
willingness to abide by Linus' decision about the whole work.
It's a moot point, though. The Linux Kernel is licensed under GPLv2, which 
means that *all* code in it has to be under the same license *and* that no 
code in it can have any restrictions *NOT* in the GPLv2.
