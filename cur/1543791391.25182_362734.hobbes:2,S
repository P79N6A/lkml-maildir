We are activly maintaining sparsemem.  But we do seem to have fallen
short on the testing front on some of the architectures.  I'm looking
right now into getting some automated testing sorted out for SPARSEMEM
specifically so that we catch this stuff much earlier in the pipeline,
as its much simpler for us to find the earlier a problem appears.

I had assumed that it was being maintained, but its not obvious from
this thread that we're all on the same page.  But we'll find out and get
that sorted.
