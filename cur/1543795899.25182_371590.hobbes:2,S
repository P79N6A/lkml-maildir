it may depend on what you do with it. I reached 1000 days with a
2.4.19pre5 plus a lot of patches a few years ago. However, it would
have been dangerous to leave this machine exposed because there were
so many local root exploits that the smallest vulnerability in any
installed service would have cause a disaster. But I also have some
machines running 2.4.22+some patches which have not been rebooted
since kernel upgrade, and which are used as front firewalls on a
big fat internet pipe, and they are still up and running normally.
So I can say that 2.4 was stable enough 2 years ago, and is even
more right now. Judging from the many people reporting years of
uptime (and from local experience), it seems that 2.4 reached such
a stability around 2.4.18.
