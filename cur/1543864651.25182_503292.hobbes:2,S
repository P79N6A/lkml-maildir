This is a known limitation of tick based accounting used on most 
architectures. 
It was fixed on s390 and using a cpu timer on every context switch. (IIRC ppc 
is now using this infrastructure as well)
see for a 
http://www.kernel-traffic.org/kernel-traffic/kt20041117_284.html#8
for the first patch in the series.
I dont know if there are plans of using the infrastructure on x86 compatible 
platforms. I also dont know it that is actually easy to implement with x86 
hardware.
