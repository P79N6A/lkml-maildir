Probably not, but it's hard to tell. 
When they sell you the system, they have to tell you how to get sources if 
those things run Linux, but they don't actually have to make the sources 
available otherwise.
(I didn't look the things up, but it's also pretty unlikely that they'd 
have a custom kernel on them. I don't see why they should - at least the 
IC-402 thing seems to be basically just an embedded PC. So I suspect they 
have little incentive to keep anything secret).
