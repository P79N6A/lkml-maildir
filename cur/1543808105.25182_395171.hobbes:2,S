Ah, I thought its the same.

Er, you mean /proc/fs/reiserfs/{partition}/on-disk-super?
bernd@bathl ~>grep attrs_cleared /proc/fs/reiserfs/hda6/on-disk-super
flags:  1[attrs_cleared]

Yes, 2.6.13 now makes the same trouble. No difference with 2.6.15.3. 
I played with mount -o noattrs, this makes no difference with 2.6.13, but has 
some effects to 2.6.15.3. Creating files in /var/run is possible again, 
lsattr gives "lsattr: Inappropriate ioctl for device While reading flags 
on /var/run", but deleting files in /var/run is still impossible (still 
rather bad for the init-scripts).
Thanks,
