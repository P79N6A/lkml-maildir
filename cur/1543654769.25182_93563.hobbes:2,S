Greg-
not that I am trying to be a PITA but where did you get the information that 
initialized variables live in .bss?
Initialized variables live in .data, the .bss (Block Started by Symbol) is 
reserved for non-initialized variables.
Look:
visitor@satelite:~> cat a.c
int first_var;
int second_var = 5;
visitor@satelite:~> gcc -S a.c
visitor@satelite:~> cat a.s
        .file   "a.c"
.globl second_var
        .data
        .align 4
        .type   second_var,@object
        .size   second_var,4
second_var:
        .long   5
        .comm   first_var,4,4
        .ident  "GCC: (GNU) 3.2"
