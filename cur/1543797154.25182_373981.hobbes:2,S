This classic vibrator is a womans best friend... 
The Jack Rabbit Vibrator is a dual control multi-speed vibrating
and rotating 7 1/2" x 1 1/2" Vibrator.
Made of a bright pink, pliant jelly, the tip is realistically sculpted.
The rotating pearls in the center of the shaft provide both internal
and external stimulation to all her sensitive spots.
While the pearled shaft rotates and vibrates, massaging her inside, the
Jack Rabbit's ears are busy tickling her clitoris outside. The shaft and
stimulator are controlled separately, so she can customize her experience every time. 
Jack Rabbit Vibrator Features: 
Dual Control Multi-Speed Vibrator 
Rotating Pearls 
Rabbit Ears for External Clitoral Stimulation 
The Jack Rabbit is 7 1/2 inches long x 1 1/2 inches in diameter
