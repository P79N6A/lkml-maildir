Just installed rmap12a with 2.4.17 vanilla on a
amd 1400mhz box 512 mem and 2 drives setup in
raid0. one a ata66 and the other ata100.
Getting the best tiobench and bonnie++ scores i can ever 
remember seeing. Ive tried all the other patches floating around
-aa, -mjc ,-ac2,etc
2.4.17 vanilla tiobench was around 40-44meg/sec
2.4.17-rmap12a tiobench 57meg/sec
