Jeff / all -
Jeff is (again) 100% correct with comments - the sata_mv.c I used 
from Kumar's 2.6.23 Powerpc tree is very *close*, but not exactly 
the same as the sata_mv.c in the 'official' 2.6.23.1 tree.
I have verified that I now can access my disks behind the 7042 chip
with the 'mainline' 2.6.23.1 (and my bsp)...
Sorry for the false alarm - thank you Jeff for pointing me in the right
direction with this!
Sincerely,
Tom Morrison

First you need to try 2.6.23.1 rather than 2.6.23, because it contains a
critical sata_mv fix.
