If I've parsed this query correctly the answer is: Linux is licensed under the 
GPL and because a number of people that have contributed code to it can no 
longer agree to a change in the license because they have died this cannot be 
changed. That was explained quite clearly in several mails as well.

When Linux was licensed under the GPL there was only *ONE* real choice for 
licensing it. Linus released the code under the GPL and there it has 
remained, with Linus leading development. If Linux had *NOT* been released 
under the GPL it would not be as popular or as powerful as it is - and that 
is not an opinion but a statement of fact.

See the previous statement and several previous mails in this thread. Linux is 
licensed under the GPL, it is the *only* license agreed to by everyone that 
has contributed code. If I remember the statistics, there have been something 
like 10,000 different people that have contributed code. Since each 
contributor holds the copyright on their code they are the *ONLY* people that 
could change the license on it. Anyone attempting to change the license 
without agreement from *everyone* that has contributed code to the kernel 
they are in violation of US and international copyright laws.

Nope. You've just ignored it when it was explained *why* the existing ZFS code 
cannot be simply be ported to Linux. If you really need ZFS on linux, might I 
suggest that you port the code on your own and maintain whatever patches are 
needed to use it? As it stands ZFS *might* show up in Linux as a from-scratch 
implementation, although I stress the "might" because there are patents 
involved.
