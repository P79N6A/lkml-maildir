How does it invalidate such testing? WTF? Alan, I _did_ shift it into the
instances of ->release(). Excuse me, I simply would not submit the patch
otherwise. If you know of the reason why shifting the lock inside 
->release() may be a problem (shifting == it _did_ appear inside) -
please, tell. Module refcounting is _not_ one - I've fixed places that
needed ->owner for ->release().
