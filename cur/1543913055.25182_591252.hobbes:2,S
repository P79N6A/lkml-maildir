Huh?
You're not making any sense. I think what you meant was "It's perfectly fine 
to put BSD-only code in a dual-licensed file. You just need to make the file 
*BSD* only."
And you are correct - but you (and I may be wrongly interpreting your words) 
and a lot of other people have complained that Jiri made modifications to the 
Atheros code and only licensed his code under the GPL. What none of you have 
done is complained that Mr. Floeter did the same thing - made changes to the 
Atheros code and made his changes only available under *ONE* of the licenses.
Apparently the reason why people that are complaining about Jiri doing such 
haven't complained about Floeter doing the same thing is that he used a 
license that you and the other people like.

Wrong - I said "You can't complain about Person A doing X when you let Person 
B do X without complaint". To whit: you can't complain that Jiri has made 
changes to a dual-licensed "work" and only released his changes under one of 
the licenses on the work when somebody else - in this case Msr. Floeter - has 
done the same thing.

Nonsense? Maybe in your little fantasy world. In the real world what I have 
proved by stating the facts is that you are complaining about something - and 
apparently claiming that its illegal - when somebody else has done the 
*EXACT* *SAME* *THING* and you have no problem with it.
(And since you apparently keep forgetting, that "exact same thing" is 'making 
changes to a dual-licensed project and only releasing the changes under one 
of the licenses on the project)

Huh? You are complaining about one person doing something and are not or do 
not see a need to complain about somebody else who has does the same thing.
You either have a problem with the action or you don't - in this case it 
appears that you are complaining because the person in question made a choice 
you don't like.

Nice straw-man, but I'll answer anyway...
I do, all the time. But I also do that in a forum where it does some good, and 
I even use my own money to try and do something about it.

No, no confusion. You could care less about the code being dual-licensed. Your 
choice of subjects 'GPL weasels' speaks volumes. You don't care that Jiri 
made a perfectly legal choice of license for his code. Truthfully, Jiri's 
choice doesn't actually matter that much. AFAICT the original dual-licensing 
of the code stands and only the identifiable portions attributable to Jiri 
are GPLv2 only. (IANAL, but I don't think Jiri's choice of license affects 
Mr. Floeters or Mr. Lefflers licenses at all - as a combined whole the code 
carries it's own license while the individual parts are licensed by their 
respective creators under whichever license they choose. This is something 
that has been discussed numerous times on LKML.)

Because you are being inconsistent. That much is clear from reading your

By contributing to a project - a "combined work" - a developer (or author) 
maintains copyright and full licensing control over his portions of the work. 
But has granted, implicitly, the right to re-license said contributions under 
the license on the "combined work" if said license is different than the 
license on the contributions.
(This is literally and quite legally true. If I contributed code to, say, 
Linux, and placed the BSD license on my code, then, because the license is 
different than that on Linux, I have implicitly granted Linus (or whoever has 
put together that specific kernel series) the right to distribute my code 
under the GPLv2.)

Technically true, but I wouldn't want to test this theory in court.

Agreed.

Agreed. And on this you are correct, however I do not believe that he could do 
such without changing the original licensing - because by removing said text 
he is not leaving a person receiving a further distribution aware of the 
choice that exists. (Except in-so-far as the files that contain the code he 
has modified.)

Fully agreed, and sorry about the argumentative tone. This is the point I wish 
people would understand - and the one I was trying to make. Floeter made 
changes to Sam Lefflers code and those changes are BSD only - nobody 
complained about it - at all. Jiri makes changes and releases his code under 
the GPL(v2) only and people begin complaining that he is removing a choice, 
altering the license on the original, violating the license on the original, 
etc..,
Now I have examined the evidence and Jiri *DID* make some mistakes with his 
original patch-set. The only files he could remove the BSD headers from and 
not wind up treading on somebody elses toes is to only do such on files that 
he himself has (at least partial) copyright claim to. (and even then, with 
the BSD license not being compatible with the GPLv2, he can't even do it with 
files containing Mr. Floeters code, because that is BSD only - the best he 
can do is add a note to the header stating "Portions copyright XXXXX, 
released under the GPLv2")
