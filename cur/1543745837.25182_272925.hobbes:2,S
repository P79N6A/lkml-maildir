I doubt hdparm works on CD/DVD drives.
What is setspeed doing, internally?
My CD drives spin at "normal" (no more than speed 8) when playing CD-DA,
if I am listening to Ogg, I manually spin it down by using "calm-cdrom".

BTW, I can't spindown CD-DA, because upon opening /dev/hdb for the ioctl, the
cd player resets :)
