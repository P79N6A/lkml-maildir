	Do not know whether if this is reported or not but I'm experiencing
some problem with 2.3.50 and 2.3.51 + Postgres.
	In addition, apache + mm 1.0.12 also failed in 2.3.51.
	Errors indicated in the postgres log file show some initialization fail
with the shmget.--> shmget failed (Invalid arguement ) key5432010,
size=120, permission = 700. 
	just to let you guys know...
thanks
