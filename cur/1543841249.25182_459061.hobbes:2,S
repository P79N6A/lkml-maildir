Euh, ...
I wonder why you need to initialize the ipw2200 module so early ? It was my
understanding that the initramfs thingy was run very early in the process, and
i had even thought of moving fbdev modules into it.
Do you really need to bring up ipw2200 so early ? It is some kind of wireless
device, right ? 
As for initramfs, you can just cat it behind the kernel, and it should work
just fine, or at least this is how it was supposed to work.
