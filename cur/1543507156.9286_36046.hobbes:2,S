this is what I was talking about...  I have been using linux for over 3 years
and have never come across this list, why is this kind of information
hidden? this is something that should be linked all over the place, and made
plain as day.. like linuxhardware.net, kernelnotes.org, www.linux.org,
www.linux.org,  metalab.unc.edu/LDP, etc
Joe.. just my 2 cents.. this woudl more than likely take some if the traffice
off this list......
