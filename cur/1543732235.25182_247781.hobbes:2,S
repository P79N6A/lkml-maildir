Is it just me or the bogomips rating listed there completely out of whack?
I'll note however I don't have a kernel 2.6 box lying anywhere nearby,
but I shouldn't have thought the way the bogomips rating is counted
would have changed.
Anyhoo my understanding is that bogomips are used for timing in a few
obscure circumstances -- maybe this could be causing the problems?  (I
would have though about 10x higher would be more correct)
