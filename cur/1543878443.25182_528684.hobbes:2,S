Then no SFF hardware can use ata_irq_ack. Not one card: Because in every
case it is permissible that BAR4 is not allocated and the device is
running non-DMA, or that the SFF hardware does not support DMA.

We should just rename ata_irq_ack(). It is in libata-sff, so it's either
wrong (missing a test), or in the wrong file completely.
