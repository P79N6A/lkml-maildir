I've got similar problem, because I has used 2.1.131 UP (so SMP=1
was marked out with '#') and patch couldn't patch Makefile because
of this change. Restore Makefile to the 'official' state or patch
Makefile by hand (I hope I'm right : you might want to change 131 to
132 and remove SMP=... and remarks before it, see the patch)
