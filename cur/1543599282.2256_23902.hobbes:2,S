No, that's over-doing it. It's not worth it - you are better off just
taking the (rather smallish) risk that the meta-data isn't already cached.
In the long run, if you _really_ want to be clever, then yes. But in the
short run I doubt it's all that noticeable.

Just worry about data, not meta-data. That simplifies the whole issue a
_lot_, and means that you really only need to change readpage().
