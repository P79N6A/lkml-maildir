	Those macroes are just fine, except the  spin_trylock()
	which must be as follows:
		#define spin_trylock(lock)	((int) 0)
	However, with RedHat 6.0 contained egcs 1.1.2 compiled
	2.3.6 kernel my network isn't working at all -- or well...
	... it can receive, but tcpdump tells that incoming frame
	is some insanely large thing, like 340 MB, and crashes.
	Same Tulip driver that works with 2.2.10pre3 doesn't help
	at all.
	2.2.10pre3 (and even 2.2.6ac3) exhibit strangest *leakage*
	(looks like)  of file descriptors...  All the sudden the
	default 4000 open files aren't enough in the system, so I
	upped file file-max to 8000 to have some room:
		# ls -ld  /proc/*/fd/* | wc -l
		    380
		# cat /proc/sys/fs/file-nr 
		6169    1816    8000
	System uses 4353 'file' structures, yet all processes in
	the system contain only 380 fds :-/
	What other things consume those open files ?
