You can enable 'display watchdog logouts' on server - then you'll find
when exactly breakage happened. And then remembering what you did at
that time, eventually looking into logs what happened at that time.
And if you have recent enough kernel
(2.4.0-test5-preX) and recent enough ncpfs (2.2.0.19.pre10), you can
define environment variable NCP_OVER_TCP (or wait until I make option
from this). Then NCPfs will use TCP instead of UDP, and as TCP was
designed to survive almost everything, it can give you better feeling.
For sure it give you better performance for reading/writting files...
Unfortunately, you must have NW5.0 or NW5.1 to have NCP/UDP or NCP/TCP,
if you have 3.12, you'll have to stick with IPX. 
If everything else fails, you can change 'number of watchdog packets',
'delay between watchdog packets' and 'delay before first watchdog packet'
on server... On NW5, you can set this to 100, 10mins and 14days,
giving you almost 15 days connection without watchdog... And if even
one of 100 packets comes through at day 14, connection stay alive for
another 14 days... And if your network is so bad/busy that none of
100 watchdog comes through, I believe that you cannot work with
that network (default is 10 watchdogs every minute, so if your networking
dies for more than 10 minutes, you get logged off)...
                                    Best regards,
                                            Petr Vandrovec
