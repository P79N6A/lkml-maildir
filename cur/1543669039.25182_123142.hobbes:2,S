yes, I have both, a scanner and a printer plugged into the computer
but there is nothing under /proc/bus/usb, it's empty
(there is no /sys/ on my PC?)
the usbview application also complains that there is no usbfs although
it gets registered by the core usb driver
drivers/usb/core/usb.c: registered new driver usbfs
everything works with 2.4.20 - so the hardware is ok
thanks
Jens
