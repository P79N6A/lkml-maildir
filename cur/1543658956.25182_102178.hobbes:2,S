Yeah, I'm lazy: I don't really want to have to deal with two new
module loaders: one for 2.6, soon to be followed by one for 2.7.  But
if someone volunteers to do and _maintain_ an interim kernel loader,
that's fine with me.

But it would be more in keeping with the Linux philosophy: do the
Right Thing, fix up "broken" stuff by doing whatever is necessary.
I'm also a bit worried about changing module loaders so often.  Yeah,
once you switch to a kernel-loader, presumably users won't be
affected, but (kernel-module) developers will be.
