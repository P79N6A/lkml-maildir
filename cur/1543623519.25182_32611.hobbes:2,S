Dbench throughput is not significantly affected, but that is probably a function of my puny little machine more than the effectiveness of the patch.  I'll have some results on a much more beefy 8-way PIII tomorrow.  Earlier versions of the patch reduced BKL contention during dbench by 60% on the 8-way.  CPU utilization spinning on the BKL has been as high as 40%.

Also, there seems to be a plan already in progress to do this on 2.5.  BLK
has been moved around in several filesystems to ease transition to another
lock.
