Do you have a reference to the contract establishing that cession of
rights from the buyer to Tivo?  To the extent that some contract
purports to restrict the user in ways contrary to the GPL, I suspect
Tivo might have a hard time defending it in court.

By the first sale doctrine, someone who buys an item has practically
unlimited rights to deal with it or dispose of it as the buyer wishes.
The only things that would restrict that are statute or a contract
entered as part of the sale -- most likely a EULA or other shrink-wrap
agreement.  Given that most such recognized agreements deal with
software or services rather than hardware, I am not sure a court would
recognize a hardware EULA as being binding.  (I suspect this is the
direction you were heading with the paragraph below.)
