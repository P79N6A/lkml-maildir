I think of it as "bitter pill we will be forced to swallow", and then
hope and pray that we can use your AFS stuff as a transition step to --
after many years -- migrate people away from AFS altogether.  ;-)
Or maybe that's just wishful thinking.

a bit of noise

Surely you want s/int/long/ here?
Two other comments:
* even though you're referencing 'current', I'm a bit surprised you
  don't need any locking at all in sys_getpag.  Is that guaranteed
  through judicious use of xchg()?
* is it reasonable to make credentials support a config option?
  Long term I worry about Linux kernel becoming another Irix, supporting
  thousands of rarely used syscalls unconditionally.

P.S.  Looking forward to the "cachefs" code you have in your cvs repo
hitting mainline.  That will be fun for NFS.  <grin>
