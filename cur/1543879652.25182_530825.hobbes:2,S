Yes it does.
This is where I was going beyond what you were doing.  I needed a flag to say
that this a kthread that is stopping to test in recalc_sigpending.  To be certain
of terminating interruptible sleeps.  I could not get at your struct kthread
in that case.
If it wasn't for the wait_event_interruptible thing I likely would
have just thrown a union in struct task_struct.
I also got lucky in that vfork_done is designed to point a completion
just where I need it (when a task exits).  The name is now a little
abused but otherwise it does just what I want it to.

Yes. But if they are looping, unless signal_pending is set it is quite possible
they will go back to sleep.

We don't break out until either condition is true or signal_pending(current)
is true.
Loops that do that are very common in the kernel.  I counted about 500
calls of signal pending in places that otherwise care nothing about signals.
Several kernel threads call into functions that use loops like
wait_event_interruptible.  So I need a more forceful kthread_stop.  If
I don't want to continue to use signals.

Yep.  My second patch in this last round implements that.
