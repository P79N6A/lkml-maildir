Subject: Multiple warnings when compiling network driver in 2.4.0-test9

Hello,
While trying to compile a network driver for 2.4.0-test9 (+kdb-v1.5,
configured for UP) I'm getting multiple warnings:
	/usr/src/linux/include/linux/sched.h:700: warning: can't inline call
to `__mmdrop'
	/usr/src/linux/include/linux/sched.h:704: warning: called from here
This happens for every kernel header I try to use such  as netdevice.h,
skbuff.h, malloc.h and pci.h
Each of those header files includes slab.h (line 14) that includes mm.h
(line 4) that includes sched.h which contains the following on line 700:
700:	extern inline void FASTCALL(__mmdrop(struct mm_struct *));
701:	static inline void mmdrop(struct mm_struct * mm)
702:	{
703:		if (atomic_dec_and_test(&mm->mm_count))
704:			__mmdrop(mm);
705:	}
My make file uses the following flags:
gcc -fomit-frame-pointer -Wall  -Wstrict-prototypes -Winline -O3
-D__KERNEL__ -DMODULE  -DDEBUG  -DMODVERSIONS -I/usr/src/linux/include
Can anyone tell me what this warning means and if I can safely ignore it (or
expect disaster) ?
	Thanks,
