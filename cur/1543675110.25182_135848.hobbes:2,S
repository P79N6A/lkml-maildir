Hmm, should I say "Thanks, Santa!", or is this a completely different problem 
from the one I reported on Saturday 24th May:
"[BUG] IDE DMA timeout, then crash on reenable (2.4.20-SMP)"?
If this fix *is* related to my bug report then is there any way that I can test 
this, now that we know what might be causing it? My usual way of reproducing it 
is "boot, then wait for 28+ days of uptime", which doesn't sound like a part of 
a plan to get 2.4.21 out the door...
Cheers,
Chris
