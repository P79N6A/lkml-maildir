... because it must call schedule and schedule is a barrier.

Right.

_In Linux,_ sleeping is defined to be a compiler barrier.

You're getting too worried about the compiler implementation. Start
by assuming that it does work ;)

If a function is not completely visible to the compiler (so it can't
determine whether a barrier could be in it or not), then it must always
assume it will contain a barrier so it always does the right thing.
