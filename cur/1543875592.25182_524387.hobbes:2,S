No, at least, as far as I understand this. I have computed _torques_, not
forces vector (this was misleading info in my first post), the question is
"how can I pass torques through plane and direction entries into KS?".

This sounds good for me, if I (or someone) have forces vector, but it
doesn't help me in my situation.
