I have copmpiles 2.4.16 and did some tests with a mirrored system ( 
only the system, without the harddisks with data) using different 
NICs: Davicom FE (dmfe), RT 8139C (8139too) and SMC 9432 EtherPower II 
  83c172 (epic100).
The System did work fine (the Realtek-NIC I had a huge amount of 
collisions, but it did work!, with the SMC-NIC the Tx-speed was not 
hipeak, but it did work werry constant).
I testet nearly every protocol I can handle and created a realy hard 
networktraffic for a nearly a complete day and the system did not crash!!
Hopefully I was setting my configuration up, connected the 
data-harddisks and rebooted - id did not take 30 minutes and the 
system crashed again. My knowledge of systems is not the best, but for 
me this seems to be a hardwareproblem with the board. From a 
retrospektiv point of view: this box did work for nearly 3 years under 
Linux (suse, debian, slackware) and with FreeBSD and it worked fine - 
but only with one harddisk.
I know that this ALI-board is not the best, but I did not know it is 
realy so bad.
