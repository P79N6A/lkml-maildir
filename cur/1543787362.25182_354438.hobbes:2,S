Thats just plain crap.  And your trash talking is plan crap.
My sas drivers have been rejected for
more than a year now. They were only accepted in the  
past week.  During that time, I've had to endure many changes
in the driver to get them where they were accepted.  And that
has been very painful. I hope you know that we have support
CSMI/SDI interface (yes, we are SAS by the way). 
How do you suggest we do that? The IOCTLS were rejected.

Ok, fine, James Let them all in.  
I have never said to alientate any other technology.  
When did I ever say that?
I'm still not convinced that your sas transport will 
work with any other technology but yours.  Or will it?
Christophs sas transport layer is generic?  I see nothing there
that says "this is MPT".   I thought all along since OLS, that you 
were going to develop a layer that would work below it
for cards that don't have firmware assist? 
Are you working with these guys on that?   I thought that is 
what you were doing, or maybe I'm misunderstanding something here.

I agree with you.
