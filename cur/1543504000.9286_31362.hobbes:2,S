Yep.  I believe the Buslogic drivers have been fine in this respect ro
ages, and afaik the Adaptec ones should also work OK.  What is missing
is systematic testing of these configurations, of course.

In principle it's not really different fromt he retry work we already
have to do on a host-originated bus reset.

Yes.  Unless you are using raw IO with some synchronisation protocol
running between the two hosts, you need to make sure that only one host
has the device mounted at once.
