This doesn't work.   For example CONFIG_ALPHA_EV67 depends on
CONFIG_ALPHA_EV6, so we'll never use the -mcpu=ev67 flag.
I'm reverting this part.  I see nothing wrong with an if/else
tree for this.  It's straightforward.  I think anything you come
up with to replace it will be harder to understand at a glance,
and therefore more fragile.

I've just removed these targets.
I'm testing the rest of the patch now.  Will apply if successful.
