I'm sure I could but I'd prefer to have us all come (as close as
possible) to an agreed theoretical interface first :-)
What you've got working there is nice but it still downsides (unless you
can set me straight).  First, we still have the problem of either 100s
of unused files or an index to use in a request.  Also, if you've got
many pcf9557s in a system you'll have a bunch of pcf9557-n; how do you
know which is which?
I think with the above solution we're coming very close to a sexy
system.  We don't need an index file, we have all the information we
need to find which device is which, there's no need to calculate any
full gpio number, there's no files which aren't going to be used, it's
safe, extensible, scriptable, sysfsish..  Am I missing anything?
