Of course common ECC codes detect and correct single bit errors.
When used in memory, bits in a word are never adjacent so a cosmic
ray or other stray particle which could upset bits usually result
in bits being upset in different words so they remain correctable.
The MIT paper is noticeably deficient in its ability to do anything
useful. It proposes checking things at 100 Hz intervals and trapping
each memory access as though these things happen only once in
awhile and, of course, assumes that the code doing the checking will
never be corrupted. Further, it ignores the cache(s).
