Without a freezer, how would you ensure that other processes don't mess
up your memory state while you're saving/reloading the image?

It's really just paranoia, particularly for where swapfiles are in use.
While developing the swapfile support, I had a couple of occasions where
I messed up my superblock because of a bug. I'm very confident now that
the suspend code itself is stable and mature, but since the device
drivers aren't there, I'd rather not remove the safety nets just yet.
