We are working on reducing the delay to about 15ms. It only occurs when
the driver is loaded or the link brought up.

We had thought about doing this, but were a little nervous since we did
not know of any other drivers that worked directly with pages.  If this
is an official direction to work directly with pages, we will. But the
existing approach is well tested through our beta cycle, and we would
prefer to leave it as is and update to a pages based approach in the
future.
Thanks a lot for all the comments.
