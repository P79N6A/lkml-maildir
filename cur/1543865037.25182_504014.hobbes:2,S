TSC is either synchronized by design or not reliable
to be used for anything, let alone timekeeping.

- * New Funky TSC sync algorithm borrowed from IA64.
- * Main advantage is that it doesn't reset the TSCs fully and
- * in general looks more robust and it works better than my earlier
- * attempts. I believe it was written by David Mosberger. Some minor
- * adjustments for x86-64 by me -AK
- *
- * Original comment reproduced below.
- *
- * Synchronize TSC of the current (slave) CPU with the TSC of the
- * MASTER CPU (normally the time-keeper CPU).  We use a closed loop to
- * eliminate the possibility of unaccounted-for errors (such as
- * getting a machine check in the middle of a calibration step).  The
- * basic idea is for the slave to ask the master what itc value it has
- * and to read its own itc before and after the master responds.  Each
- * iteration gives us three timestamps:
- *
- *	slave		master
- *
- *	t0 ---\
- *             ---\
- *		   --->
- *			tm
- *		   /---
- *	       /---
- *	t1 <---
- *
- *
- * The goal is to adjust the slave's TSC such that tm falls exactly
- * half-way between t0 and t1.  If we achieve this, the clocks are
- * synchronized provided the interconnect between the slave and the
- * master is symmetric.  Even if the interconnect were asymmetric, we
- * would still know that the synchronization error is smaller than the
- * roundtrip latency (t0 - t1).
- *
- * When the interconnect is quiet and symmetric, this lets us
- * synchronize the TSC to within one or two cycles.  However, we can
- * only *guarantee* that the synchronization is accurate to within a
- * round-trip time, which is typically in the range of several hundred
- * cycles (e.g., ~500 cycles).  In practice, this means that the TSCs
- * are usually almost perfectly synchronized, but we shouldn't assume
- * that the accuracy is much better than half a micro second or so.
- *
- * [there are other errors like the latency of RDTSC and of the
- * WRMSR. These can also account to hundreds of cycles. So it's
- * probably worse. It claims 153 cycles error on a dual Opteron,
- * but I suspect the numbers are actually somewhat worse -AK]
