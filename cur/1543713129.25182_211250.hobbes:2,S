This is saying "is the buffer is not on any list, then place it on the
mapping's list now.  If the buffer _is_ already on some list then we know
it must already be on mapping->private_list, so we have nothing to do".
Re-dirtying an already-dirty buffer is an extremely common case, and here
we look for an opportunity to avoid dirtying a cacheline or two.
