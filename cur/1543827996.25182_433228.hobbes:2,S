I ran 2.6.17-rc6-rt3 with combined_mode=libata and this worked to make
the hd work at full speed, but something weird is happening:
It lists both hd's as the same device: 
#df -h
/dev/sda1             276G  276G  727M 100% /
/dev/sda1              73G  1,1G   72G   2% /mnt/fs1
#ls /
bck-sys-20051017  boot  etc-2006-02-16  lib    nfs   root   src  tmp   var
bin               dev   etc-2006-02-17  media  opt   sbin   srv  udev
blfs              etc   home            mnt    proc  share  sys  usr
#ls /mnt/fs1

This must clearly be a bug.
