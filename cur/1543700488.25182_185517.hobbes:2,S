hi,
I wanted to read the IDE status registers, as i want to write to disk with
all the interuppts disabled. Please, tell me a way to do this. I was
wondering if i cud make use of the ACPI code, as it too reads the status
registers. But i dont know how exactly it is done.
Also, i wanted to know, how to issue IDE commands directly to the IDE disk.
i cannot find the kernel code where this is done.
thanx,
Kanika
