This is just minor cleanup patch.
is_init() is available on 2.6.20-rc1 (include/linux/sched.h):
/**
 * is_init - check if a task structure is init
 * @tsk: Task structure to be checked.
 *
 * Check if a task structure is the first user space task the kernel created.
 */
static inline int is_init(struct task_struct *tsk)
{
        return tsk->pid == 1;
}
