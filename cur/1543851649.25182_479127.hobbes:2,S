That's a requirement I am specifically avoiding with CacheFiles.  I might, for
instance, want to use it on my laptop, and I don't really have enough space to
set aside a partition just for that.  The whole point of CacheFiles is that
you don't have to set one aside.  If you're going to do that, then CacheFS
should be a better option.

That's still user visible, and SELinux in enforcing mode would still apply.
