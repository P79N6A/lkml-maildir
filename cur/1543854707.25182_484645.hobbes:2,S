Ok.  Could we hold off on this a little bit?
In general I think this is sane, but looking through my pending
patches I have at least one patch that uses find_get_pid from
a modular context.
The general issue is that drivers and thus most modules should
not be aware of pid_t values.  However there do seem to be a few
rare exceptions.
