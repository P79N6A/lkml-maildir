Tested this on my laptop, which is a shoddy testing environment because
it lacks serial devices... no, not all of my boxen are UltraEnterprise,
AlphaServer, and Altix systems (the Altix isn't even mine, it's werk's).
But anyway, I got some kind of backtrace in yenta_interrupt, that said
"stack pointer is garbage, not dumping" or some such, followed by an
interrupts-off deadlock later in some unclear location (looks like ICH
scanning or some such; while legible, I couldn't make heads or tails of
it). ISTR PCMCIA IRQ/etc. stack consumption issues; this may be related.
Russell, I didn't know whom to cc:; if you could redirect this in the
proper direction (e.g. PCMCIA maintainer) I'd be much obliged.
