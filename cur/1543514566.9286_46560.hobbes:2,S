Ah, I don't have the log at hand unfortunately. It's a problem with the
IDE CD-ROM (on a Compaq Proliant 1600). Happens with burnt CDs. Joliet, I
think. Does not seem to be an issue with the filesystem. It produces read
errors, the log says something about restarting the driver. It was kernel
2.2.5-15 (stock RH6.0), I have upgraded since then to 2.2.13, but I don't
use the CD-Rom much, hence I haven't checked if the problem persisted. I
will retry it, if you wish, but not until tuesday.
