I'm ignoring file-as-dir until/unless someone figures out a sane way of
doing it.
Under Reiser4, think of all files/directories as objects.  Meta-data, as
accessed through file-as-dir or through /meta, is just a collection of
methods to that file/directory.  Some methods are just accessor
(setter/getter) methods, like foo.mp3/artist -- they are effectively
attributes, although there may be a little more logic going on there
(foo.mp3/artist probably is connected to foo.mp3's id3 tag).  Some
methods actually do something, like secret.txt/compression.
The reason I'm bringing that up is that some people seem determined to
keep the very concept out of the kernel because it's new, strange, and
doesn't seem to have any real applications.  I want it in because it has
real, fairly immediate applications, and much bigger payoffs down the
road, and I don't think it's that strange -- it's a nice, clean design.
