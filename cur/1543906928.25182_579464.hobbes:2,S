I reverted this patch alone and rebooted, still the same problem.
After reboot:
   0 RPM for case fan,
   correct CPU fan speed, drops to 1/16 after kmsensors' first refresh
After unloading and reloading the driver:
   correct speed of case fan,
   correct CPU fan speed, drops to 1/16 after kmsensors' first refresh
