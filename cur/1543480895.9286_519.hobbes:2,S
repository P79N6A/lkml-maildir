I also get netscape stuck in the loop doing SIGALRM and select. ON
2.0.36!
I suspect this is a problem with netscape, but it might not be.
For me it happens when switching mail folders (on open). Sometimes when
I switch the folder netscape shows a window (non-refreshing) and locks
up. I think that .summary files get corrupt somehow. It locks up again
if I restart netscape and go to the same folder. Deleting .summary files
helps. The problem usually occurs after mail has just been (mail filter)
delivered to the folder (using POP).
Like one of the previous posters I also browse in a lot of windows
(20-40). I also use WWWOFFLE - offline proxy cache.

I have V90, but the problem doesn't seem related to that.
