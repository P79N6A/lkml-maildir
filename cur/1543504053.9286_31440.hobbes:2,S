hello all,
	Sorry for the offline question. We are trying a driver for custom
PCI card. This card has bridge and a four PCI devices on it. This can be
plugged PCI slot. When the PC is first powered up, the devices are not
detected by BIOS, the card is taking quite a while to initialize itself.
After a soft reboot, BIOS is able to detect the devices. Is there any way
we can make BIOS recognize the devices or can we by pass the BIOS and
detect and allocate memory  by our self.
thanks in advance
sarma
