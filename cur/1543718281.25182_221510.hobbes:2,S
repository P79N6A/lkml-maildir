Hi Justin,
I've seen several reports of what seem to be aic7xxx driver bugs. And
some of them you have stated that are fixed by your new driver.
I feel we should merge it in v2.4 mainline.  
Do you have any idea of how widely use your newer driver is?
For what reason the changes you made havent been merged in the past
in mainline?
