  I would certainly like to see that, lost data in case of problems is
more of a problem than performance for many people. 
  Particularly if (a) there is an idle CPU, (b) there are no blocks queued
for write to the device, and (c) there are dirty blocks to go to the
device, it would be good to ignore the age of the block or use a firly low
minimum age. If we dropped a few blocks onto the drive each time the
conditions were met, I suspect that with many systems that would result in
a lot more free write space in memory. The total blocks written to the
drive would go up, but it shouldn't hurt performance. 
  My first thought is that the check would be done after finding no
runable normal processes and before running batch priority processes. If
only a few blocks were written each time oldest first it shouldn't even
hurt the batch processes.
