I'm all for scaling the number of janitors, but not to any random
moron with an easily created free email address. And it's not just
malicious damage, it's too easy for people to close of things as
duplicates because they look similar-ish. People need to have a
certain level of skill and trust - I'm not going to open this up 
into a total free-for-all.
