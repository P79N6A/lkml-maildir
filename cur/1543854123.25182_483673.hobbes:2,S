I don't know.  Maybe Andrew can tell us -- is it true that the kernel runs 
only one thread up through the time the core_initcalls are finished?
If not, can we create another initcall level that is guaranteed to run 
before any threads are spawned?

I haven't looked at your revised patch yet...  But it's important to keep 
things as simple as possible.

Do you really want things to continue in a highly degraded mode when 
percpu allocation fails?  Maybe it would be better just to pass the 
failure back to the caller.
