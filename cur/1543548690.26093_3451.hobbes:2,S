Subject: PATCH: ide-scsi.c to allow claiming of Onstream drives
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Attached is a patch to ide-scsi.c against 2.4.0-test8.  Please consider
applying it.
This patch removes the logic which causes ide-scsi to refuse to attach
itself to an IDE OnStream drive.  While these drives are not supported by
the standard st.c driver, there is userspace support (using the sg
interface) which works with the ATAPI drive with ide-scsi patched with this
patch.
So there really is no reason for ide-scsi to reject this device.
A future patch to make st.c reject OnStream drives it is unable to support
if coming soon.
Matt
