For CSA, we are proposing to use a single (multi-threaded) demon that 
combines both the userland components for job and CSA that used to be in 
the kernel.  In this case, the pid will be the same for two connections 
along with the cpu range.  Does what your saying here mean that we 
should choose distinct values for my_pid1 and my_pid2 to avoid the two 
sockets looking the same?  I'm not too familiar with netlink, yet.
Best regards,
