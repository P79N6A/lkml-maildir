Subject: [PATCH 4/6] freepgt2: arm26 FIRST_USER_ADDRESS PAGE_SIZE
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/4/6/238

ARM26 define FIRST_USER_ADDRESS as PAGE_SIZE (beyond the machine vectors
when they are mapped low), and use that definition in place of locally
defined MIN_MAP_ADDR.  Previously, ARM26 permitted user mappings at 0 if
the machine vectors were mapped high; but that's inconsistent with ARM,
and FIRST_USER_ADDRESS would then have to be determined at runtime.
Let's fix it at PAGE_SIZE throughout the architecture.
