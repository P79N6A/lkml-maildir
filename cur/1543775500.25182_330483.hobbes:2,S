Yes, and rightly.
One of the misunderstandings about userspace filesystems (Linus falls
into this) is to compare it with microkernels.
FUSE (and userspace filesystems in general) are NOT meant to replace
in kernel filesystems or the VFS.  They are an addition with which
different kinds of filesystems can be implemented much better than
they could be in kernel.
