DAMNIT... Sorry, wrong, the dd crapped ou anyway at 48737112 (IO error),
which if you add the starting partition offset of 17318133 gives you
66055245.
ARGH... I can only theorize that either A) The drive is actually causing
the IO error, or B) Linux is checking lba_capacity somewhere, and we
should fix that variable too.
Right now I am half tempted to disable all  drives in the BIOS (so that I
can undo the limits jumper) and make some sort of floppy that can load up
a new BIOS (maybe a slightly hacked version of EZ-BIOS), that will then
be able to boot onto the 40 GB drive.  Can anyone say "open source the
BIOS code please so we can fix stupid shit like this!" ??
