Yehaaaw! That reader can be found on DELL X300 too. It works almost fine
for me, see attached dmesg. These I/O errors didn't prevent me from
mounting a card, though.

Great to see people brave enough to do such tedious work :D

Unfortunately, I don't have other cards either.

Tested with 2.6.19 without source change.

The IO errors make dd stop on my box. I tried to set TIMEOUT to 1000
(this is a slow card) without better results. Tell me if there are
things I can test.
I'm not subscribed to linux-kernel, so please remember to Cc me when
posting updates, etc. so I can test them.
