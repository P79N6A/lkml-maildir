The Rx_TCO_Packets counter should increase at each timeout you get,
so this looks like another problem.
I have got two servers with two different EEPRO100 network cards. 
One works better with the eepro100 driver, the other one seems to favour the 
e100 driver :-)
Both cards are working flawlessly now, however I was close to buying new NICs 
because of the problems like command timeouts, no resources messages and NFS 
timeouts.
