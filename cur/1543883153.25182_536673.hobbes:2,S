xfssyncd , or at least it seems so at a quick look.

I can't remember anything like this, but I believe you have a specific test
case in mind.

Well, they may be bogus, but there's something else.
I have reviewed some kernel threads used by device drivers that currently are
frozen to see if it would be safe not to freeze them, and I'm worried.
What, for example, if such a thread schedules a timeout and waits for
something to happen (eg. the airo driver does something like this), but instead
the hibernation/suspend happens and the device is frozen/suspended under it?
Shouldn't the thread be notified by the driver's freeze/suspend callback?
Moreover, what if after the restore the device is not present (for example, it
may be a pcmcia card that the user has removed) and the thread is scheduled
before the device's unfreeze callback has a chance to run?  Shouldn't the
thread check that the device is present?  In that case it would have to be
notified by someone that the check is necessary, but who can do that?
Greetings,
Rafael
