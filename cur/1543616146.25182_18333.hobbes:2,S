I know that the ARM 922 symbols came in during the last update; I remember 
having to add them to the rulebase.  I think ARCH_SHARK didn't show up before
this because I had it marked as dead (it got revived recently and I didn't
catch that for a while.
Here is the revised list:

ARCH_ADIFCC
ARCH_CAMELOT
ARCH_CLPS7500
ARCH_CO285
ARCH_FOOTBRIDGE
ARCH_IOP310
ARCH_SA1100
ARCH_SHARK
CPU_ARM922_CPU_IDLE
CPU_ARM922_D_CACHE_ON
CPU_ARM922_I_CACHE_ON
CPU_ARM922_WRITETHROUGH
DEBUG_LL_SER3
DEBUG_WAITQ
H3600_SLEEVE
IOP310_AAU
IOP310_DMA
IOP310_MU
IOP310_PMON
