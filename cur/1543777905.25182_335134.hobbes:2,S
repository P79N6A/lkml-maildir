Arjan,
   I'd like to know/understand more about memory management  on  Linux 
Kernel and I belive this concept is applyable to the Red Hat Linux Kernel.
  I have some doubts about the ZONE divison (DMA, NORMAL, HIGHMEM), 
Shared Memory utilization, HugeTLB feature and OOM with large memory and 
the kernel management of memory on SMP machines. I believe these 
features are common to the Linux kernel in general(Red Hat, Debian, 
SuSe, kernel.org), right?
   I read a tons of docs regarding symposiums, The Linux Memory 
Management Book and lots of docs about Oracle memory management but 
memory management still not clear to me.
  If somebody can help me...
Thanks.
