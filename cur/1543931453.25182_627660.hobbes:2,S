Can this be made simpler by the fact that /dev/cachefiles has its own unique
label (cachefiles_dev_t).

There is only one operation that makes sense to have a permission: "set
context and begin caching".
All the other operations on a file descriptor attached to /dev/cachfiles are
necessary for there to be a managed cache at all, and given that you've
managed to open /dev/cachefiles that's sufficient access for those, I think.

Ummm.   I was under the impression that the target SID had to be a member of
target class.
