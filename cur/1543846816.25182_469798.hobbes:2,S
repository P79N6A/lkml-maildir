Subject: [PATCH] md: Fix bug where new drives added to an md array sometimes don't sync properly.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

There is a nasty bug in md in 2.6.18 affecting at least raid1.
This fixes it (and has already been sent to stable@kernel.org).
### Comments for Changeset
This fixes a bug introduced in 2.6.18. 
If a drive is added to a raid1 using older tools (mdadm-1.x or
raidtools) then it will be included in the array without any resync
happening.
It has been submitted for 2.6.18.1.
