It's not really the bytes that worry about.  More the cleanliness of
the abstraction.
I actually realy like the approach of embeding a more general data
structure inside a more specific data structure and using a list_entry
type macro to get from the one to the other...  it has a very OO feel
to it (which is, in this case, good I think) but I suspect it a very
personal-taste sort of thing.

I'm not pushing the blk_plug_device vs blk_plug_queue distinction.
It is just that I think the current blk_plug_device is wrong...  let
me try to show you why..
First, look where it is called, in __make_request (which I always
thought should be spelt "elevator_make_request") - note that this is
the ONLY place that it is called other than the calls that have just
been introduced in md and umem - :
	if (blk_queue_empty(q) || bio_barrier(bio)) {
		blk_plug_device(q);
		goto get_rq;
	}
Which says "if the queue is empty or this is a barrier bio, then
plug the queue and go an make a request, skipping the merging".
One then wonders why you would want to plug the queue for a barrier
bio.  The queue-empty bit makes sense, but not the barrier bit...
Ok, lets see exactly what blk_plug_device(q) does by (mentally)
inlining it:
	if (blk_queue_empty(q) || bio_barrier(bio)) {
		if (!elv_queue_empty(q))
			goto return;
			if (!blk_queue_plugged(q)) {
				spin_lock(&blk_plug_lock);
				list_add_tail(&q->plug_list, &blk_plug_list);
				spin_unlock(&blk_plug_lock);
			}
	return:
		goto get_rq;
	}
So we are actually plugging it if it isn't already plugged (makes
sense) and elv_queue_empty, and blk_queue_empty ... or bio_barrier.
I wander what those two differnt *_queue_empty functions are .....
looks in blkdev.h.. Oh, they are the same.
So we can simplify this a bit:
	If (the_queue_is_empty(q)) {
		plug_if_not_plugged(q);
		goto get_rq;
	}
	if (bio_barrier(bio)) {
	   /* we know the queue is not empty, so avoid that check and 
	      simply don't plug */
	   goto get_rq;
        }
Now that makes sense.  The answer to the question "why would you want
to plug the queue for a barrier bio?" is that you don't.
This is how I came to the change the I suggested.  The current code is
confusing, and testing elv_queue_empty in blk_plug_device is really a
layering violation.
You are correct from a operational sense when you say that "no change
is necessary there" (providing the queue_head is initialised, which it
is by blk_init_queue via elevator_init, but isn't by
blk_queue_make_request) but I don't think you are correct from an
abstractional purity perspective.
