Each bit corresponds to a logical CPU on which the task
is permitted to run.  So 1->CPU0, 2->CPU1, 5->CPU0+CPU2, etc.
But it does seem there are problems with the scheduler
which occur when cpus_allowed it not all-ones.  I didn't
observe any problems in the 1-2 hours testing which I
needed that patch for, so it should be OK for experimentation
purposes..
