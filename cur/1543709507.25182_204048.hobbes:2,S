Can you provide any more details?  I have been using hotplug with USB 
devices daily on each of 2.6.2 through 2.6.4-rc1 without any freezes.  
The only problem I've noticed is my non-hotplug issue with USB on my 
notebook, using my wireless mouse.  After a cycle of plug/unplug/plug 
etc, the kernel starts spewing hundreds of messages a second about uhci 
issues and makes the machine very slow.  Doesn't fix until I remove the 
uhci module.  Has nothing to do with devfs or hotplug however.  Both of 
those work perfectly [for me] on four different machines.
