Hmmm.
I don't think so.

is already equivalent to

>                      ret = SWAP_MLOCK;  /* saw at least one mlocked vma */

because page_mapped_in_vma() can return 0 if vma is anon vma only.
In the other word,
struct adress_space (for file) gurantee that unrelated vma doesn't chained.
but struct anon_vma (for anon) doesn't gurantee that unrelated vma
doesn't chained.
