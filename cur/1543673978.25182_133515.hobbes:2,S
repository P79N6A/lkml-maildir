RedHat's 9 backport of vsyscalls uses 'nosysinfo' name for 
option which does simillar task (it just stops kernel from reporting
relevant AT_SYSINFO completely).
BTW, what's reason for this backport? They just always put int 0x80
into this page, so even on real CPU kernel booted with nosysinfo
is faster than one which uses this vsyscall entry point.
VMware's panic should be fixed in next update, but I'm afraid that
penalty from exectuing code in upper couple of MBs of address space 
will not disappear. Moving SYSINFO page from FFFFE000 to FF7FF000
(PKMAP_BASE - PAGE_SIZE == VMALLOC_END + PAGE_SIZE) would fix both
problems.
