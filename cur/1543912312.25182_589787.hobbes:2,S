And thank you, you answered:
Anything before "ACPI: boot correctly with "nosmp" or "maxcpus=0"" is
fine.
Right, though that surprised me (and had me confused for a while,
I'd forgotten that I'd backported those mods into an earlier tree).

So I was wrong about that.

Precisely the reverse: it only happens when CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU is
not set.  Which accounts for why I didn't see it when testing my
maxcpus=N fix, since I had CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU on at that time.

I've underestimated it, and done little beyond confuse myself today.
It'd be easy enough to fix, but there are probably about 20 different
ways, finding the right way is not so obvious to me.  I need to get
to understand it better tomorrow (unless someone beats me to it:
I know little of the possible, the present and the online myself).
