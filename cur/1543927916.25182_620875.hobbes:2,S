Sorry, I didn't really mean to submit it for inclusion yet, as I
explained in the first mail in the series. I probably should have left
out the signoff to make this clearer.
Thanks for the feedback anyway.

Yes, I intend to do that in the final version.

I haven't really started working on that I'm afraid. I imagine the
parts dealing with data transfer will have to be completely separate
due to the differences in the DMA interface. Probably the interrupt
handler as well, unless we're willing to live with a few #ifdefs in it.

Yeah, the help text is indeed confusing. I'll update it.

We used to have lots of problems with overruns and underruns and those
parameters were useful to limit the transfer rate. Now that the RDPROOF
and WRPROOF bits seem to have taken care of these problems for good, I
guess we can remove this parameter.

Yeah, could be. I'll look into it.

Yes, most of it is redundant, but the hardware register dump might
still make sense, but it should probably be turned into a dev_vdbg().

Yeah, although I want to fix that before submitting the final version.
The hardware has a special "byte mode" which will be slow, but it
should work.

No, it just stops the clock. I suppose we could use clk_disable()
instead of resetting the controller, but I don't think there's any
controller state we really care about at this point anyway.

Indeed. I'll remove it.

Ah. I think this solved some kind of oops-on-card-removal thing at some
point, but I'll try to remove it and see what happens.
Hmm...no, that can't be the case. I have to admit I don't quite
remember why we put that there.
