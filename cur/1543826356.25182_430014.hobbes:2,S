Subject: [PATCH 8/9] PCI PM: clear IO and MEM when disabling a device
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/6/5/52

This patch modifies pci_disable_device() to clear IO and MEM from the
COMMAND PCI config register.  This is required before entering D3,  but
also probably a good general practice for system suspend.
