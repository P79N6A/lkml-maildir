Well unfortunately, even with out the little modification, 
bk-current now locks right after printing out the hdd 
geometry/partition info.  Apparently, something in the slew 
of patches which went in today has broke my setup. 
Unfortunately, I'm using the -mm3 patchset, so I can't say 
for certain that it isn't causing problems with the recently 
checked in code.  Any suggestions on how to go about 
debugging this?  I'm using a usb keyboard, so I don't think 
the Magic Sys-Req button will work at this point [Alas, KDB 
is currently non-functional for 2.5].
Cheers,
Nicholas
