I was assuming that the work being flushed was submitted by the same
context, but I think I see what you are saying now.  Essentially if that
queued work was unrelated to the thread that was doing the flush, it
doesn't care if it gets rescheduled.
Do you agree that if the context was the same there is a bug?  Or did I
miss something else?
