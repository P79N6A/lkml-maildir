Subject: [2.6.20.17 review 30/58] nfsd: fix possible read-ahead cache and export table corruption
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The value of nperbucket calculated here is too small--we should be rounding up
instead of down--with the result that the index j in the following loop can
overflow the raparm_hash array.  At least in my case, the next thing in memory
turns out to be export_table, so the symptoms I see are crashes caused by the
appearance of four zeroed-out export entries in the first bucket of the hash
table of exports (which were actually entries in the readahead cache, a
pointer to which had been written to the export table in this initialization
code).
It looks like the bug was probably introduced with commit
fce1456a19f5c08b688c29f00ef90fdfa074c79b ("knfsd: make the readahead params
cache SMP-friendly").
