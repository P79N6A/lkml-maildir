In fact we we already have that already in the XFS tree (Steve called it
do_generic_file_write although I'd really prefer __generic_file_write).

The O_APPEND special casing is certainly very, very ugly - application
should use it on block devices at all - if they're screwed when doing it
anyway it's their problem.
And I think we can expect reasonable ulimits for root nowdays, although
I'm open for discussions on that one.
