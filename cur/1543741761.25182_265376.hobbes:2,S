Hi,
1. Not all packages use autoconf.
2. Not all packages use autoconf correctly.
3. Autoconf and others are broken in my opinion (yes they provide some 
good features but have very high amount of bad features or stupid concepts 
too). This is not only mine opinion btw.
4. Changing the directory structure just to rename /lib to /Library is not 
very ambituous... I can even call it strange...
5. I am thinking of changing directory structure (and some other things) 
some more... For example placing every package in its own dir - like 
/apps/gcc/3.4.2/<install date>/{bin,lib,...} and placing symlinks in /bin 
(or how to call it) to required files from packages bins (like RELINK), 
adding something like /apps/<package name>/<version>/<install date>/deps 
and keeping symlinks to all external libs/programs/scripts used by 
<package name> there, changing autoconf to ask not test for features and 
much more (= turning Linux standards upside down).
