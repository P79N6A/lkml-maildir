Could we please focus on things that are on the table _now_?.  You are
submitting the patch aganist the current code and I can only review it
in this context.  I can't say if I like your _future_ patches at this moment! :-)

Can we just assume there are no other patches and proceed under this
assumption?
Could you please remove the macro for now?  You can introduce it with the
other patches when you submit them (if it's still needed at that time).
