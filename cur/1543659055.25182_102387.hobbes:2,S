Do remember you need CHAP and SRP authentications.
Do remember you need full ACL's
Do remember you need all corner cases.
Do remember you need Sync-n-Steering.
Do remember you need to support the entire spec.
Do remember all optionals are manditory.
I forgot the rest of the list, but this plus more are the min.
requirements.
