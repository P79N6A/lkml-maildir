Greetings,
I'm encountering a rather annoying error on one of our AMD Opteron
boxes. I recompiled the working 2.6.17 kernel to add some extra SCSI
support and booted to find something similar to:
usbcore: registered new interface driver usb-storage
USB Mass Storage support registered.
usbcore: registered new interface driver hiddev
usbcore: registered new interface driver usbhid
drivers/usb/input/hid-core.c: v2.6:USB HID core driver

request_module: runaway loop modprobe binfmt-0000
request_module: runaway loop modprobe binfmt-0000
request_module: runaway loop modprobe binfmt-0000
request_module: runaway loop modprobe binfmt-0000
request_module: runaway loop modprobe binfmt-0000
... and then a hung kernel.
I figured I'd enabled/disabled something I shouldn't have and went
through the kernel config many times, recompiling with different
options (including ELF and misc emulation support), but to no avail.
As time ticked closer to 5pm on a Friday my interest decreased and so
I tried upgrading to 2.6.18 and then 2.6.19, with a tonne of different
configurations. Still nothing. The best I could achieve was on a fresh
2.6.19.1 I managed to pass the modprobe and load some input drivers,
but then it hung directly after that.
...
request_module: runaway loop modprobe binfmt-0000
request_module: runaway loop modprobe binfmt-0000
request_module: runaway loop modprobe binfmt-0000
input: AT Translated Set 2 keyboard as /class/input/input0
input: PS/2 Generic Mouse as /class/input/input1
Any advice on debugging this would be appreciated. How can I discover
what is trying to load binfmt-0000 and why is it looping?
Regards
