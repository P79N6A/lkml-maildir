I don't know if it will help, but here's my 2 cents (US :-). I'd love
this to be included into 2.5.x Linux, as it is a very nicely written,
modern CIFS client that we can use to start adding UNIX specific extensions
into Samba, and hopefully end up with a filesystem that uses UNIX semantics
when talking to a Samba server, and will fall back to Windows semantics
when talking to lagacy Windows server (I really love saying that :-) :-).
Should be a big help in making Linux the "universal client glue" we know
and love .... :-).
Cheers,
