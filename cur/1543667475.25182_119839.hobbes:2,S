Hello All,
This is a very basic doubt I suppose, but I am not able to figure out.
If I want to send a message to IP addrs 158.168.1.1 using sockets, how to 
assign sock_data.sin_addr.s_addrs with the above IP, if I am assigning this 
in a kernel module, where functions like gethostbyname() is not avaliable to 
me.
Your help will very valuable.
Thanking You
Shesha
