Subject: pre-2.3.29-1 SIGSYS same as SIGUNUSED?

pre-patch-2.3.29-1 defines SIGSYS as number 31, the same as SIGUNUSED.
The only place SIGUNUSED is referenced is in arch/i386/kernel/vm86.c
#define ALLOWED_SIGS ( 1 /* 0 = don't send a signal */ \
        | (1 << SIGUSR1) | (1 << SIGUSR2) | (1 << SIGIO)  | (1 << SIGURG) \
        | (1 << SIGUNUSED) )
vm86 is not patched in 2.3.29-1 so we end up being able to send SIGSYS
via VM86_REQUEST_IRQ.  Is this intentional?
