This code will not be suppoerted by the glibc code.  Using these
primitives would mean significant slowdown of all operations and this
for problems which only a few people have.  I asked to get the useful
parts of the code to be made available using the current futex interface
(robust mutexes are useful) but Inaky and rest rest never acted on this
and instead invented this completely incompatible interface.  IMO this
code should not go into the mainstream kernel.  Let those who want to do
realtime work bear the costs.
