How is that not single user?
I have been doing single-user oriented Linux/GNU/unix longer than anyone
I'm aware of with exactly that focus. The one trivial patch I do to the
kernel disgusts the core Linux developers for reasons unrelated to single
user.  cLIeNUX boots with 12 vt's logging in already as root. No kernel
molestation. (But stay tuned ;o) Rather than me contributing further to
the topic-skew, please have a browse at
