[PATCH] I2C: fix unsafe usage of list_for_each in i2c-core
i2c-core.c contains 2 loops that iterate over the list of the clients attached
to an adapter and detaches them. Detaching the clients will actually remove
them from the list the loop is iterating over. Therefore the
list_for_each_safe() method has to be used.
