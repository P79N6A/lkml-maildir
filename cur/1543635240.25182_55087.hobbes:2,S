David, Dell never produced a Linux device driver for the Dell SCSI Array
card.  I had forgotten about the AHA-154x emulation feature, but since it
doesn't seem to work, it's unlikely that it ever will.  Everyone who worked
on that project 9 years ago has left for other opportunities.  The on-board
NCR SCSI controller should still work, and you can use software RAID quite
easily to accomplish similar functionality.
Thanks,
Matt
