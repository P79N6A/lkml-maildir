This doesn't do much when you want to actually free slab pages though...
I had a similair thought, where you'd mark slab pages where you should 
aggressively try to free the containing slab objects in future scans, 
but didn't send it since someone else had probably already thought of it.

Hmm, so if slab is on the LRU, then in some cases the page can't be 
freed because of locked slab objects and new objects get allocated to 
the new mostly free slab page, and you didn't free very many pages.
Though this might better utilize the slab pages...
