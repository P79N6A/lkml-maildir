I severly doubt this will a problem. If you look at the drivers that
I marked this way on x86-64 I will bet some beer that they never worked
(some not even compiled) on alpha. Worrying about a userbase of drivers
who have never worked does not seem to be very useful. It definitely would
not be a regression at least.
Can you please shortly explain what will not be maintainable with my
proposal?
