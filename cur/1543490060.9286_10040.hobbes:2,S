	OK, just using 2.2.3 did not help. So I upgraded to the latest
	knfsd 1.2, and I got more useful logs. The FreeBSD box attempted
	to mount the Linux partition on an insecure port. I have modified
	the /etc/exports to look like : /u0 <freebsd.machine>(rw,insecure)
	and it is now fine (for that problem).
