(1) fix for fault_in_page_*() not faulting in enough mmupages.
(2) fix for bogus open-coded ptep_to_address()
(3) fix for iounmap() missing its targets
Unfortunately, none of these are the bug we're looking for.
(which is wrong pages landing on the LRU's)
A pgcl-2.5.70-2 patch with these changes incrementally atop
pgcl-2.5.70-1 is also available.
