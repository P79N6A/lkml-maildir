Yes. It is normally NULL as file handles don't usually have a process
to send a signal to.

If having a pid to signal is optional, which it almost always is, 
being able to handle that case easily and return a 0 to user space is helpful.
So far it is my assumption that everything that looks up a pid and converts
a pid to a number will do it with respect to the current processes pidspace.
A very reasonable assumption and only with siginfo have I found a case where
it looks like I might not be able to implement it that way.
