Robert, 
I appreciated your report. Thanks.
The network issue is what I'm concerned with: the kernel core methods are
the _same_ with and without networking.
If you're able to reproduce the problem locally I'll try to track down the
thing. Three factors (involving network, which I know almost nothing
about) are too much for me right now :)
