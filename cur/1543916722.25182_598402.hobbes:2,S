Are you "git-friendly"?  A few quick kernel compiles and reboots would 
help us narrow down the problem, given that it's a reproducible regression.
The first step would be to clone the "upstream" branch of 
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/jgarzik/libata-dev.git
and see if the problem is reproducible there.  If yes, then you have 
narrowed down the problem to something my ATA devel tree has introduced 
into -mm.
Once the blame has been squared fixed upon me :) you can use git-bisect 
to locate the precise change that broke your setup.
