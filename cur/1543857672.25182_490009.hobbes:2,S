Infact, just inserting a CD is enough. No need for a media player to try and access the files. :)
The backend must be polling and trying to mount the disc upon insertion. Kernel 2.6.16 and before did that fine, but kernel 2.6.17 and above don't and give error messages. Which explains why downgrading the kernel solves the problem. (If it were a HAL or KDE/ GNOME problem then shouldn't downgrading the kernel *not* help?) Just thinking aloud ...

Same symptoms occur with mplayer also, dmesg flooded with warnings, what about 
hal or KDE's cdpolling backend?
