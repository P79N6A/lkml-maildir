Yeah, I can see what you mean here...  but on the other hand it makes the 
existing code a bit clearer (no extra args), and really it doesn't push us 
*that* much further from non-pci_dev tied resources.  Any patches in that 
direction will just get a few lines bigger, that's all.
But I agree that eventually we may want to have non-pci_dev resource lists, 
especially if we start adding advanced host bridge drivers or something.
