Hi, I wonder where can I find documentation or
information on how Linux's zerocopy works. 
Specifically on what conditions does data copy get
eliminated?  Also does it speed up all read and write
operations on sockets?  Or it just works for certain
drivers or network interface cards?  
I went through the kernel source code and still see
copy_from_user() calls in the data paths for socket
writes. But I am new to the kernel source.
Thanks for any information.
