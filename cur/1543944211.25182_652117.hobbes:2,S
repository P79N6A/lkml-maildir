IBM's powerpc box can memory hot-add/remove by dynamic partitioning.
And our fujitsu server has memory hot-add feature (Ia-64).
So, they are concrete user of memory hotplug.
In x86, E8500 chipset has the feature of memory-hotplug.
(I searched a data-sheet from intel site.)
http://download.intel.com/design/chipsets/e8500/datashts/30674501.pdf
(6.3.8 IMI Hot-Plug)
So, it depends on how many server uses it, I think.
Thanks.
