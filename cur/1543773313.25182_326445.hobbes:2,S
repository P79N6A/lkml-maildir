This worked fine, but fishing around, I see 'new' cards ID's are added all the 
time:
http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/alsa/alsa-kernel/pci/emu10k1/emu10k1_main.c?rev=1.58&view=log
so eventually the [UKNOWN] bit will disappear and alsamixer settings will 
remain between different version kernels (2.6.1x[.x]) then.
