I need the ability to delete an arp cache entry using `arp -d ...`.
Is this being removed? If so, I can't test embedded systems that
all come alive with a phony IEEE station address. Software normally
re-programs the SEEPROM with a real IEEE station address from a
data-base, over the network. The target is then restarted to
enable the new IEEE station address, and the server has the old
one deleted from its arp cache. Failure to delete the arp cache
entry results in a failure to connect, or a timeout of 5 minutes
for the arp cache entry to expire. Either one can't be acceptible
in automated testing.
