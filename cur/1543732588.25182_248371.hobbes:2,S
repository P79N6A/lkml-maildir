No, the current version(idea) is mainly a sysfs/kobject notification,
not a data channel, or something that requires a more complicated logic.
(but, yes, your example applies to simple event sequence numbers too. We
can't expose these kind of "snapshot data" by a sysfs value).

There will be only very few cases for that, but some drivers will want
to send these kind of information to userspace (even binary blobs). 
Don't know if this kind of data dump should be part of kevent or better
handled by something driver specific. It gets even more complicated, if
the userspace listener must interpret all these different data formats.
Maybe we just need to rename "kevent" to "kobject_notify" to make the
focus more clear :)
Thanks,
