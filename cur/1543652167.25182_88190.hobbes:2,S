The default is 2048. How long does the io_load test take, or rather how
many tests are appropriate to do? To get a good picture of how it looks
you should probably try: 0, 8, 16, 64, 128, 512. Once you get some of
these results, it will be easier to determine which area(s) would be
most interesting to further explore.
There's also the write passover, I don't think it will have much impact
on this test though.
