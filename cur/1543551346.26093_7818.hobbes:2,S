They are implemented as per-cpu things but the Intel manuals say that
all cpus should have the same MTRR settings.  They also give
pseudo-code for how to update them on an SMP system, which mtrr.c
follows.
If the BIOS has set them up differently at boot time, mtrr.c will
complain and copy the MTRR settings of CPU0 to the others.
