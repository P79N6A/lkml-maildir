The same way you demonstrate that the driver you just wrote is stable. 
Run it for a few years and get back to them.  Or do you expect them to
take your word for it?
Stability can only be proven in the field which takes time.  Debian
stable is for a box that you will install and stick in a closet and
forget about for a year or two, and be basically guaranteed that the
hardware will fail long before the software does.
