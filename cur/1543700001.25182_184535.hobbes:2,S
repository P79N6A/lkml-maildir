Ok, so its been around awhile. Do you remember what was the last 2.4
kernel where you did not see this problem?

Hmm. Just skimming that patch, I notice it won't work on clustered apic
systems. They've dropped the following chunk from set_ioapic_affinity
and forgot to re-add it.
-	/* pick a single cpu for clustered xapics */
-	if(clustered_apic_mode == CLUSTERED_APIC_XAPIC){
-		int cpu = ffs(mask)-1;
-		mask = cpu_to_physical_apicid(cpu);
-	}
Further I can't see how it fixes the problem, but it may just be working
around the issue. I'd be interested in what the patch author thinks.

Could be, but I suspect interrupt routing isn't happening properly at
boot time. The irqbalance code just forces it to be readjusted correctly
once your up and running.
