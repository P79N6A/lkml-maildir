Hi,
I am about to build a new server and I am looking at a suitable mainboard. I
was about to choose the ASUS A7M266-D when I was reading on Alan's page that
he had some fun with this board and now I'm not sure if it will be stable
enough in the current state.
Does anybody have some experiences with this board, good or bad ? And will I
get a stable system with it ?
Thanks a lot,
Marco
