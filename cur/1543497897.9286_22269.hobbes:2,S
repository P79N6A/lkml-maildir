Somebody (likely in Sweden) is resending all their incoming email
to some gateway address, but the writers of that gateway are truly
morons, and they send the error reports to WRONG address.
Now I could kill all swedish recipients of linux-kernel  to stop these
bounces from occurring, but that is a bit too harsh...
