You're right, I should have made myself clear.  My goal is not to get
deadline removed, but a discussion with Andrew some months ago showed
he was averse to creating more options than we already have.  So since
I expect elevator can surpass deadline, I wanted to show that I think
deadline is the one that it should replace.  Certainly, CFQ and as can
both beat elevator for a good number of workloads.

My first priority is to get that patch in order.

what are people's thoughts on this?  since schedulers are modular, do
we need a scheduled removal, or can this just sit in -mm for a while?
if people are concerned about scripts which ask for 'deadline', we
could add another exception (like the as->anticipatory one).
