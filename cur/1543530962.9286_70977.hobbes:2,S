One that is not strickly an OS. The whole purpose of a missile (a cruiser,
at least) is not "running", is *crashing* (upon the target, hopefully).
Yes, it sounds like that NT is the choise, here, after all! B-)

Definitely none of them. Don't run a Web server on my life-support system,
please. Nor i want it to be "multiuser". And please, don't make it
multitasking, it has only *one* real important task to perform, thanks...
Besides that, i see no reasons for a missile or a life support system to
have a MMU in the beginning. No paging, no swapping, no overcommitting...
