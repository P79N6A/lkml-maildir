I recently got an ISA Phonejack card and quickly found it wouldn't 
work with a stock 2.6.7 kernel. 
So found this bug in the ISAPNP part of the code, throughout the 
code it use it's own data structure to reference it's base IO address,
in the ISAPNP code this was not being populated with any value hence 
it can't talk to the card and so the driver fails.
