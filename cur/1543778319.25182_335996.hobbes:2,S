I guess this proves my point :-)
But lets look at the signal.c code as well:
        if ((!info || ((unsigned long)info != 1 &&
                        (unsigned long)info != 2 && SI_FROMUSER(info)))
            && ((sig != SIGCONT) ||
                (current->signal->session != t->signal->session))
            && (current->euid ^ t->suid) && (current->euid ^ t->uid)
            && (current->uid ^ t->suid) && (current->uid ^ t->uid)
            && !capable(CAP_KILL))
                return error;
Why did they do the (current->signal->session != t->signal->session) and
not also do (current->signal->session ^ t->signal->session)?
Bit shifting for doubling (or quadrupling) may or may not be confusing,
(I don't mind that), but using xor for non-equal is IMO past that line.
Since, I usually use xor for bit masks. Looking at the above code,
especially since it is not always used, I would think that euid, uid,
and suid are all bitmasks.
