Well that's cute.  This patch causes an i386 `make allmodconfig' to spew
these:

    SDA is GPIO Number (BFIN_SDA) [] (NEW)

    SDA is GPIO Number (BFIN_SDA) [] (NEW) 
    SDA is GPIO Number (BFIN_SDA) [] (NEW) 
    SDA is GPIO Number (BFIN_SDA) [] (NEW)

out at about 1,000,000/sec, infinitely.
I'll put a `depends on BFIN' in there to shut it up, but I think you've
