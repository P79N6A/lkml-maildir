# Just too bad this is a typical single-user-only mechanism: I don't want the
# same icons (or messages, or whatever) to apply to make(1) as the next
# guy. It is a UI problem, and UIs are user setup configuration stuff, not
# file format stuff.
Not really. This is the difference between system-wide configuration and
user-wide configuration. The system-wide is the defaults, but the user can
override it. (Bearing in mind some sort of central system would have to be
used where forks weren't available, the same system could be used where
the fork wasn't writeable...).
There's plenty of other uses for them besides icons, anyway :>
