What I wan't to disable is just the *unconditional* fallback to 16 bit IO
at some places. This and not more. This doens't even affect the physical setup 
between the host chip and the controller on disc.
The global "wheee I'm a poor and can't afford 32 bit IO" option will remain
there of course.
So we have no  issue here. OK?
