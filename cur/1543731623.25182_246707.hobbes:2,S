You are trying to evade the point. And the point is not how performance
in these phases (and their impact on other phases) can be improved, or
what excuses did you have for not `doing' it, but the fact that after it
was found that large keys behave badly, these phases were turned off,
others were switched to lexicographical operation, _and_ resulting
benchmark is used as a basis to call other people names.

Surely, as a `big dog' what other sounds can I produce? :)

That's ok with me, but it would make sense to remove unfair benchmarks
from the site until then.
