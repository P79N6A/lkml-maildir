Yes, I am relying on the hardware.  I was under the impression that it was
pretty much universal that making the pmd read-only would make the hardware
treat all ptes under it as read-only.  This came out of a discussion on
lkml last winter where this assertion was made.
Do you know of a page table-based architecture that doesn't have and honor
read-only protections at the pmd level?
