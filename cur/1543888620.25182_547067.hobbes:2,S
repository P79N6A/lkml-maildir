xfs_buf_associate_memory is a mess.  My original plan was to get rid of
it, but I kept that out to keep that patchset small and easily reviable,
but it seems like that was a mistake.  My plan is the following:
 - xlog_bread and thus the whole buffer I/O path grows an iooffset
   paramater that specifies at which offset into the buffer we start
   the actual I/O.  That gets rid of all the xfs_buf_associate_memory
   memory uses in the log recovery code
 - add a buffer clone operation as suggested by you above, and use
   the offset in xlog_sync aswell.
until then you patch below looks fine.
