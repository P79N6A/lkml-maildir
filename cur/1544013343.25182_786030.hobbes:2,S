Dunno what export actually does -- drivers/acpi/Makefile
has been this way for many years.
I believe that -Os is the right way to build the ACPI code.
I see that src/Makefile now has
ifdef CONFIG_CC_OPTIMIZE_FOR_SIZE
KBUILD_CFLAGS   += -Os
else
KBUILD_CFLAGS   += -O2
endif
so maybe we are now being redundant?

can do.
