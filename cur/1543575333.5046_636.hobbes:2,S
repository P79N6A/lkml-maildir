Kevin,
This sure looks like it -- I was able to get it working using your
technique.  Thank you!  It is a relief to know that this was just an
application layer issue rather than something deeper.
My apologies for soaking up cycles on linux-kernel for what turned out to be
a non-kernel issue -- but a big THANKS to everyone that helped track the
problem down -- let me know the next time you're in Pittsburgh, and I'll buy
you a beer (or the beverage of your choice).
