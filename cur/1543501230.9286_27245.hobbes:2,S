The problem is that when you write to a file that inherits other files,
you have to decide what bytes go into what inherited files.  Easy if the
length of the file has not changed.  Hard if it has changed.  Hard that
is until rms walked with me to dinner, and he suggested using
delimiters.  Doesn't matter what syntax, and actually he said the syntax
should be configurable.  Notice how this means that emacs needs no
changes at all to effectively edit these anti-streams.  Then
loic@ceic.com said that rdf (
http://www.w3.org/RDF/
) was a good syntax.
I trust that loic@ceic.com is right, he's pretty sharp, I haven't
reviewed rdf.  If not, then we can invent a syntax....
So, basically, a filter that reads and writes to directories on one
side, answers reads and writes to a delimitered flat file at the other
end should implement it fairly well for us.  I expect that the first
filter will be rdf syntax, and who knows after that.
No, I don't care whether the filter is in user space or the kernel, user 
space or kernel, it's all part of the file system.
