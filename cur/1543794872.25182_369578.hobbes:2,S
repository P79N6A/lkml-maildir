It's not much of a warning, it seems to stop vbetool from working (which
may explain a few complaints about ACPI suspend being broken in 2.6.15 -
it's not, but vbetool is...)
vbetool (well, strictly it's LRMI, but...) needs to access real-mode
memory. On the other hand, it's probably a bad idea to let it actually
scribble over RAM that the kernel may be using. So
MAP_PRIVATE|PROT_WRITE seems to be the correct thing to do. This
certainly /seemed/ to work in older kernels, but doesn't any more. What
should I be doing instead?
(I'm also not quite sure why the error claims that it's deprecated,
whereas in fact it doesn't actually work at all. Breaking userspace
without warning isn't terribly nice)
