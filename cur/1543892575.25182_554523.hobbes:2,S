Right, what I meant is that USB keyboards are affected by the very same
problem you describe (163 in kernel will be 153 in X), and it can't be
worked around by setting softraw to 0.

By doing that, you'll be following a dead end road - and noone will fix
the issue for non-PS/2 keyboards.

Yes, but once you create the linuxkeyboard description, you don't need
softraw=0.

I'm sure SUSE will update some of the existing tools to work with the
kernel-based keyboard selection well.

That will likely not work, obviously.

Yes, the linux kernel solution is linux specific. But a lot of other
interfaces that X uses are OS specific.
