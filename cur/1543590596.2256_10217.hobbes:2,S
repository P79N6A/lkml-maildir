Hi,
  The zero-copy TCP patch that was integrated in 2.4.4 has allowed us
to move the task of reassembling of the fragments into one buffer
until we're out of the ->data_ready() bottom half context.
  In 2.4.4 therefore, the nfsd thread can end up calling the function
skb_linearize(), in order to allocate a new buffer and copy over the
fragments.
  IMHO allocating the buffer using GFP_ATOMIC is a mistake. As I said
we're in a thread context, so sleeping in GFP_KERNEL is safe. In
addition, the cost of dropping the request if we can't allocate the
buffer is heavy in that the client has to wait for a timeout, and then
retry.
I'd therefore like to propose the following change.
Cheers,
  Trond
