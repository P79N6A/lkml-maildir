Actually the FSF always anticipated that case because its the same as
the GPL app on non-free OS case and the GPL there says
"However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not
include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or
binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of
the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable."

Well if you are going to provide the source then its not really a binary
interface, its a jump table.
