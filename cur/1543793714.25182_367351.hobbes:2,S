You will have to teach us how it is done.
As you likely know by now, Linux doesn't incorporate new technology
en mass.  We sniff and poke at it, break it down into its constituent
elements and reconstitute it in ways that seem to fit Linux better.
It's all part of how we keep the body Linux healthy.
Especially for things like this that touch many of the more interesting
kernel constructs, the end result seldom resembles the initial input.
