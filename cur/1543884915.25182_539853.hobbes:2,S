The BIOS initialises and powers up the downstream PCI express port
when it detects a card is present.
When Linux boots, it enumerates the bus and sees it, but does not do
prior configuration to enable, configure and cause link negotiation on
all PCI express ports I believe; this requires chipset and (sometimes
revision-) specific code, which wouldn't be so robust as the BIOS
doing the footwork.
I have the same problem on my Sony VGN-SZ240. The problem would be
addressed if the BIOS powered up all PCI express ports, but then this
would draw more power. Perhaps if just needs to do the hotplug
configuration correctly, but then older OSs may have problems?
