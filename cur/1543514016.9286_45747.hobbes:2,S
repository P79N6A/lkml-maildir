Thanks to all who responded.
There still seems to be problems driving rev6 and rev7 silicon.
The symptoms are that no sound is playing and no interrupts
are received.
My WAG's are that either the sample rate converter is misprogrammed
or there's a problem with the DMA engine. It's quite impossible to
fix this myself, since I neither have docs nor hardware for/with
the new silicon. Esp. the SRC already employs some black magic.
I'm going to ask my Creative Ensoniq contact...
