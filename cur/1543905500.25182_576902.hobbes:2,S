Okay -- I tried rewording the text here a little to make this clearer.  Can
you review the new version to see that it's okay.

Thanks for the info.

Thanks.

I made the sentence:
    Because allocation is done in block size chunks, fallocate()
    may allocate a larger range than that which was specified.
okay?

Okay -- thanks.  I reworded the text for the ESNODEV error to make this
clearer.  (Please check the wording in the next draft.)
By the way in fs/open.c I see the comment:
        /*
         * Let individual file system decide if it supports preallocation
         * for directories or not.
         */
        if (!S_ISREG(inode->i_mode) && !S_ISDIR(inode->i_mode))
                goto out_fput;
But that comment doesn't seem to accord with the line of code immediately
below it (S_ISDIR() check is doene regardles of file system type).  Do I
misunderstand something -- or is the comment wrong?

I made it:
    The mode is not supported by the file system containing the file
    referred to by fd.
Okay?

New version of the page on its way soon.
