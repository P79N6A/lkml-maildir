I am working on some code that reads packets from the netlink device
(IP_FIREWALL_NETLINK) to do some specialized reporting about certain packets.
I was looking at the sample code in fwinterface.c (libfw-0.2) and it looks
like it reads 65535 bytes at a time (and always returns less).
Questions: 
  Are you guaranteed to only get one packet for one read or
  are there sometimes several? 
  Does a read always return the start of the packet or is there a
  possibility that you may start reading in the middle of a packet?
  If you don't read packets fast enough, are some discarded?
