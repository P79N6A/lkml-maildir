The problem is that the disk ack'ed the command when the block went into the
write cache.  You *DONT* in general get back another ack when the block
actually hits the platters.

It's hard for the kernel to be more reliable unless you just disable the write cache.
The biggest reason we don't see more issues like this is that the average MTBF
really is up in the 100K hours and up range, and most drives probably get
around to actually writing all the blocks out every minute or so - so you're
looking at literally a 1 in a million shot at corruption.  Most of the time,
it's writing back in-order enough that no badness happens - and with the rise
of journaled file systems like ext3 and jfs and resierfs, the chance of
actually getting bit by it drops even more (you'd have to hit a case where the
blocks were re-ordered *and* the corresponding journal blocks didn't get
written either).
Yes, this family of problems has been around ever since write caches were
introduced. It's just taken until now that we've got file system code that's
rock solid enough that the write cache is a major reliability issue - for the
longest time, one kernel bug or another has been more of a concern.
See the IDE corruption in early 2.5 kernels that scared a LOT of people
away - I believe that one was done all by the kernel, without any help
from the disk's write cache. ;)
