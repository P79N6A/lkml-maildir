Evolution has big trouble with the ext3 (and maybe others) journal.
I've _never_ seen evolution having scheduler priority problems, only
journal problems (absolutely every damn time hefty I/O is going on).
What should we do about I/O tasks that decide to use massive cpu?
IMHO, absolutely nothing beyond what ever we decide to do with any other
cpu intensvive task.  There is nothing special about scheduling I/O
heavy tasks.  If it uses massive cpu for sustained periods, it must pay
the price.  In the meantime, an I/O intensive task that decides to use
heavy cpu will round-robin at relatively high frequency with every other
"interactive" task, which may also be doing a burst of cpu heavy work.
The reason for doing that cpu intensive burst just doesn't matter.
Currently, we special case I/O tasks to limit the dynamic priority boost
they can get via I/O.  I think that is wrong.
