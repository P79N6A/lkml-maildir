well, i investigate into my problem, building kernel with debug, and i
noticed some strange...
when the system boot up it load mouse without problem:
drivers/input/serio/i8042.c: d4 -> i8042 (command) [562]
drivers/input/serio/i8042.c: 14 -> i8042 (parameter) [562]
drivers/input/serio/i8042.c: fa <- i8042 (interrupt, aux, 12) [564]
Synaptics Touchpad, model: 1
 Firmware: 5.8
 Sensor: 35
 new absolute packet format
 Touchpad has extended capability bits
 -> multifinger detection
 -> palm detection
input: Synaptics Synaptics TouchPad on isa0060/serio1
then it start to search for the aux port, with success:
drivers/input/serio/i8042.c: d4 -> i8042 (command) [584]
drivers/input/serio/i8042.c: f4 -> i8042 (parameter) [584]
drivers/input/serio/i8042.c: fa <- i8042 (interrupt, aux, 12) [586]
serio: i8042 AUX port at 0x60,0x64 irq 12
and for the last it find the keyboard:
drivers/input/serio/i8042.c: 00 -> i8042 (kbd-data) [629]
drivers/input/serio/i8042.c: fa <- i8042 (interrupt, kbd, 1) [631]
drivers/input/serio/i8042.c: 41 <- i8042 (interrupt, kbd, 1) [640]
input: AT Set 2 keyboard on isa0060/serio0
serio: i8042 KBD port at 0x60,0x64 irq 1
but here the problem is the same: when i press a key it seems that i
press this keys for almost 4 time (eg. i press "a", and it give me
"aaaa")
when i try to stop my system, i pressed alt+sysrq, +s, for sync, +u for
mounting read only, and i mistake and pressed alt+sysrq+i, so i killed
every task.
well, i noticed here, with debug still on, that when i pressed a key, it
received only one pressure:
drivers/input/serio/i8042.c: 0c <- i8042 (interrupt, kbd, 1) [168545]
but it write to standard output for characters.
i think the problem is just here, then, someone wants to help me to fix
this?
thanks
adri
ah, just for knowledge, my keyboard is the standard keyboard with laptop
hp pavilion ze4200...
