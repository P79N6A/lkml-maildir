Subject: NFS client may be broken in 2.2.11pre4

I have three PC's running 2.2.11pre2, 2.2.11pre2, and 2.2.10, respectively.
One (canopus) is an NFS server running 2.2.11pre2 and the other two,
(antares and deneb) are NFS clients (mounting canopus) that run 2.2.11pre2
and 2.2.10, respectively.
I tried upgrading 'deneb' from 2.2.10 to 2.2.11pre4. I applied all three
of Alan's patches, rebuilt, rebooted, you know the drill....
When it came back up, 'deneb' mounted 'canopus' NFS file system's but it
could not access any files. /var/log/messages contains the following messages:

I don't recognize this error but it only occurs with NFS. I was still able
to ping and telnet from 'deneb' to 'canopus'. Also note NFS doesn't appear
totally dead. My 'home' directory is NFS mounted and I was able to log in and
run my .tcshrc, .login, etc... I didn't get into this state until I tried to
start X. (Of course, everything works fine with 2.2.10 so I don't believe it
is a configuration problem).
For tonight, I'm backing off to 2.2.10 on 'deneb'. Tommorrow I'll see if the
same problem occurs with my other NFS client (running 2.2.11pre2) when I
upgrade it to 2.2.11pre4.
Please send mail directly if there is something else I should try.
