Especially given that I can load the kernel on a dual P4 xeon system in
3 seconds from power on.  But traditional BIOS's are slow, and getting
slower for unknown reasons.

I've also written the patch that allows this.
In the general case where you want to boot another version of the kernel
you must rerun the BIOS query code.  In case your new kernel can handle your
hardware better than the previous version.
The are bad cases where the kernel can leave the hardware in a state
that either confuses the BIOS or confuses the drivers when they load.
This is rare and being worked on.  But it is an independent problem.

And despite the name I can kexec plain bzImages, now.
