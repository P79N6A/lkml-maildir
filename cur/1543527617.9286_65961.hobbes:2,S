Okay. By the way in theory fbdev can support hardware text modes. Its just
no one actually does it. From fb.h
Type of video mode.
#define FB_TYPE_TEXT                    3       /* Text/attributes      */
Supported hardware text modes. 
#define FB_AUX_TEXT_MDA         0       /* Monochrome text */
#define FB_AUX_TEXT_CGA         1       /* CGA/EGA/VGA Color text */
#define FB_AUX_TEXT_S3_MMIO     2       /* S3 MMIO fasttext */
#define FB_AUX_TEXT_MGA_STEP16  3       /* MGA Millenium I: text, attr, 14
reserved bytes */
#define FB_AUX_TEXT_MGA_STEP8   4       /* other MGAs:      text, attr,  6
reserved bytes */
