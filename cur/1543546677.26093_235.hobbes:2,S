But in general, remember that it is used for "udelay" and that this is
usually used for when the datasheet says: "You need to wait 12 us
after reset before you can access the device again". If you follow the
datasheet, you'd put a udelay(12); in there. How much margin that
datasheet has is of course unknown. But the device has the option of
stopping to work at 11us, but 13us should be ok.
In practise, people have wondered how linux copes with PCs that switch
speeds. The answer: Linux doesn't cope, people are just lucky that it
keeps working. That's what Alan means with "pretty slack".
(So switching from high to low clocks generally should work, whereas
switching to a higher clock after booting may fail. However, it depends
on wether hte hardware happened to have some slack in the specs.)
