Hi-
     I recently upgraded to kernel v2.2.2. I got the new util package that it
said in the Changes doc, version 2.1.9i. Now when I try to shutdown my
computer, everything goes fine, but umount won't unmount the root directory,
so now fsock runs everytime i boot. Anny solutions, reply to this address
please. Thanks.
