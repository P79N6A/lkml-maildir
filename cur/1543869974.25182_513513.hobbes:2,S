You're right.  But cxgb3 has it now in the driver (tested and working).
Shouldn't it be pulled in?  When the network stack design gets done
(which could take a few releases to finalize), all the drivers can be
updated to use it.  It doesn't seem reasonable to allow some drivers to
support LRO and others to not support it...
