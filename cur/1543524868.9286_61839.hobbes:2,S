Subject: [BUG] write(2) hangs in 2.2.[13-14-15pre5] + OOPS in 2.3.42

	hi, rik, et. al.
	after hand patching the boobytrap, on 2.2.15pre5,
	the problem hasn't gone away.
	but it did run better, usually it goes up to 20megs
	before it dies. with 2.2.15pre5 it went 198megs and
	then froze.
	another thing, your boobytrap didn't show anything.
	then i tried 2.3.42 with uncertainty about initrd,
	i got this oops.
