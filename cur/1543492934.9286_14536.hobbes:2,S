I think this is because when you time ext2 you are actually timing the
speed at which Linux writes to the disk BUFFER, not to the disk. The other
operating systems do not return from a write until the data is really on
the disk, if I remember correctly. ext2 returns nearly immediately. In
other words, just because ext2 says the data was written to disk, it does
not make it so in reality.
