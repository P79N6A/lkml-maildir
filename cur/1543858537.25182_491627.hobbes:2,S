Calling internal symbols _INTERNAL is confusing?

But those symbols aren't, they're about internal interfaces that might
change.

Well, if EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL / EXPORT_SYMBOL_INTERNAL is about
documenting things, why restrict who can use them based on the
license?
Surely the licence is more about tainting the kernel and debugging not
politics?
Do we even need to check the license at all in that case?  Maybe a
better idea would be to embed where the source code is located and use
the non-existence of that for a tainting?
