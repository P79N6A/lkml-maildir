it is... if you disable unit-at-a-time for sure.
But I'm not entirely sure when this got in, if it was 4.0 or 4.1

the only effect I expect is more inlining actually, since we on the one
hand tie gcc's hands via the forced inline, and one the other hand now
give it more room to inline more. But yeah it's worth to look at for
sure, even if it is to see it's getting bigger ;)
