Grumble?  Oh come on, don't export binary structures through sysfs, it's
in the DOCUMENTATION THAT SYSFS IS FOR TEXT FILES ONLY!!!!
If you don't want to export a text file, then use something else other
than sysfs, it's that simple.

sysfs binary files are for PASS-THROUGH things ONLY!  stuff like this is
NOT for sysfs binary files, so even if you switched to using it, it
would not be allowed.
And if I sound grumpy about this whole thing, I am.  I'm tired of people
trying to abuse sysfs and putting crappy userspace APIs in it.  They
don't realize how messy it causes things to be over the long run.  If
you want to make your own filesystem to export stuff in whatever way you
want, feel free to do so (only takes about 200 lines including comments
to do so.)  But DO NOT ABUSE SYSFS just because you don't happen to
agree with the way it was designed, or feel inconvienced by it.
Ok, here's a new rule to help this from happening again in the future:
  If you want to add a new sysfs file to the kernel, it MUST be
  accompanied with full documentation that explains exactly what that
  file contains and what it is for.  No exceptions will be allowed.
Structure for this documentation will be in the format that I layed out
last week, I'll update it again and post it to lkml for review later
tonight.
thanks,
