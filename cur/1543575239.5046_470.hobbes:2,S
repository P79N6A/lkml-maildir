Exactly, and you wouldn't set DPL=3 for interrupt 8 since a double-fault
can only occur from ring 0..

Setting DPL == 3 of any interrupt/trap/fault gate is bad idea because it
allows the user to kill the machine with INT 8 or something like that. DPL
is checked only if interrupt is generated with INT, INT3 or INTO (IA
manual, vol 3, section 5.10.1.1).
