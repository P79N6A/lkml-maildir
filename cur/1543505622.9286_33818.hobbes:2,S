I've posted a patch for init sections in modules several times during early
2.3.x development, but received no answer from Linus so I gave up on it.
It has been widely tested in 2.1.xx series in VGER cvs, current modutils
already support it for more than a year.
For some drivers it is worth IMHO, e.g. some modules have some 512K of
initdata if I remember well.
Allowing swapping out those init sections instead of discarding them should
be fun. One issue though is to write support for it just in a few
instructions, so that not much memory is wasted on handling it.
An open question is whether to allow that swap out/swap on a page by page
basis and catch it in exception handling, or whether to swap the whole
init/cleanup section of a module or of the main kernel at once.
Cheers,
