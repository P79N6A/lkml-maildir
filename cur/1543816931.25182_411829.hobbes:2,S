The sg3_utils package may help with some raw SCSI
and SATA disk I/O measurements.
sg_dd, sgp_dd and sgm_dd are dd variants that
let you tweak a lot of low level details. The sg_read
utility can be used to measure disk cache throughput,
transport speeds and command overhead.
Recently I have been looking at measuring command overhead.
On the disks that I am testing a zero block READ (i.e.
issue a SCSI READ for zero blocks) is the fastest command.
The most recent released sg3_utils can be found at:

   [Utilities section]
The latest beta is in the news section of that page.
