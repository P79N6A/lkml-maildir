This should never be the case: vmalloc() should not be called without
holding the kernel lock. 
Whether that is actually the case right now is not something I have
verified, but I would be surprised if it isn't. As such, 2.1.x is in the
same position as 2.0.x in this regard.
Has there actually been problems that caused you to look at this?
