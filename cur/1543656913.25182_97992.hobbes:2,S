I don't think you need the OEM table to detect this, current patches do:
+static inline void mps_oem_check(struct mp_config_table *mpc, char *oem,
+               char *productid)
+{
+       if (strncmp(oem, "IBM NUMA", 8))
+               printk("Warning!  May not be a NUMA-Q system!\n");
+       if (mpc->mpc_oemptr)
+               smp_read_mpc_oem((struct mp_config_oemtable *) 
mpc->mpc_oemptr,
+                               mpc->mpc_oemsize);
+}

Support for parsing the mps oem tables is already there - I use it for
NUMA-Q ... see if smp_read_mpc_oem will do what you want ... if not,
maybe we can generalise it out.

Yup - it was only set up that way because we had a 1-1 correlation between
NUMA and clustered_apic_mode at the time. Switching the ordering as you
suggest seems sensible now.
In the last patch from Venkatesh there was a > 8CPUs option ... that
seems like a direct correlation to clustered apic support to me ...
maybe we could just switch on CONFIG_X86_CLUSTERED_APIC directly and
bypass CONFIG_X86_MANY_CPU? The menu text could stay the same (less
confusing for users than asking them about apic modes) ...
