oh its me again. sorry but the message bofore was messed up. so lets try 
again.

yes that might be easy for the NIC's transmitting enging when all fragments 
belonging together come one after the other in the transmit-ring. 
but receiving is difficult since different connections can arrive 
simultanously and reslut in interleaved framgents.
something else: you need quite a lot of ram on the NIC to buffer fragments.
if not it will have to transfer the data twice through the PCI (checksumm are 
at the beginig of a packet not the end). nobody did spend a second on 
thinking to implement all in hardware when the interet protokol was desinged.
do you know any NIC that is capable of chaining? currenty i've a dp83820
on my desc and at the moment im not eaven shure if checksumming can
be chained over multiple descriptions (describing one single ethernet frame).
