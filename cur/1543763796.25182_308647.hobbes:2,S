When I boot without ACPI (I used 'acpi=off pci=noacpi') the system fails
to come up all the way; it hangs after loading the SATA driver. (but
before the SATA driver finishes probing the disks)
I'm guessing that the interrupt from the SATA controller is not getting
through? Anyway, I assumed that ACPI was basically required for x86_64
systems to work, is this not really the case?
Thanks,
