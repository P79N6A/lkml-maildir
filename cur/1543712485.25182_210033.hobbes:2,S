Ah! you wanted to know about exec, not fork. A true fork() is pretty rare
these days anyway. Still, the answer is pretty much the same: the fork()
gets you a new data space, retaining the old code space, and the exec()
finds (or creates) the code space that cmd's code is in and switches the
active code space to that space. Heritable data, such as file descriptors,
won't have been in the old data space anyway, so the child references them
through syscalls just as in a conventional.
Perhaps I'm missing your question here, but in general we see no problem
with fork/exec in our model - it's one of the least changed things. You
always get a new address space on a conventional, and you also do with a
Mill; the only difference is that you don't have to shoot down the cache or
TLB, so a fork/exec should be quite a bit faster.
