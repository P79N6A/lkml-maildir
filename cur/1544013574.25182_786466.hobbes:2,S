Nope.

Actually I went and verified the behaviour of the iRiver iHP20.

Yes clearly.

What made up example ?

The distribution question is 'how do you make that decision reliably and
correctly ?'. That is closely followed by 'what state should it end up in
if the relevant scripts don't run for some reason ?' - which is clearly
"not persistent" for safety reasons.

I'm not aware I was. I was simply pointing out that
- the general distribution default cannot be one that harms user data on
music players
- that you can fix it more elegantly by quiescing and validating file
systems across a suspend/resume
neither of which appears to disagree with the point that you want USB (or
increasingly SD card) to be able to autoresume when it holds file
systems. It does however make clear which way around any kernel default
should be.
