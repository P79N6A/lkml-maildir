Hi Dennis,
I think duplicating that #ifdef is bad because now there are two
places where a maintainer would have to change it.
I recommend just putting a comment in front of NS8390_trigger_send
and letting this problem go.
I tried another fix, which is to make EI_SHIFT(x) always
reference its argument (I was inspired by #define spin_lock in
include/linux/spinlock.h).  This fixes the 8390.c warning but breaks
pcnet_cs.c.
This little warning isn't worth the trouble.
Michael
