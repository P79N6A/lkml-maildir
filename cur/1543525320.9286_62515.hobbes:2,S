Agreed, and thanks.

Ah, I wasn't aware that was possible.  I had assumed that your
stat_data was rather fixed in size.
That being the case, I would like:
__u32 flags;		/* ext2 compatible file flags */
__u32 cap_allowed;	/* allowed capabilities */
__u32 cap_forced;	/* forced capabilities */
If you can do that without breaking the disk format, then it
can wait for 2.5, otherwise I think it would make sense for
them to appear in 2.3 (assuming that the format has already
changed for the 2.3 port?).
Matthew, Ted - would I be stepping on anyone's toes if I
implemented the VFS extended flag handling now and tried to
get it pushed in for 2.4?
Matthew.
