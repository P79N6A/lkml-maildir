I used to have this problem too.  Whenever I downloaded something
at high speed, I got that error.
This was with an older 2.4 kernel (2.4.5 I think), and the
previous harddisk which died on me.  Now with 2.4.8 I don't have
the problem anymore.  I assumed it had to do with the other disk
being slow, I think it was still doing PIO.  Maybe it's some
other thing which causes the kernel not being able to react fast
enough?
