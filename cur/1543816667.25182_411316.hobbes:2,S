	Please check again ;-) I agree that it's not obvious...

	Actually, when things are passed over RtNetlink, the pointer
is removed, and the content of IW_HEADER_TYPE_POINT is moved to not
leave a gap.
	The actual code for the commands is a little bit complex,
especially that the buffer is "optimised". But, if you check for the
comments, you will find it. Instead, you may want to check the code
for the event, where I do the same, and which is easier to read.
	The function is iwe_stream_add_point(), and you will find it
in include/net/iw_handler.h. Copy below...
	I was toying with the idea of changing the
IW_HEADER_TYPE_POINT struct itself, but I discarded that because the
amount of fixing in the driver that would require.

	Thanks for the quick review, have fun...
