Hmm, so module loading is not serialized by a lock?  I assumed that
caused the deadlock in $subject which started this thread ...

They can't actually probe themself.  It's _one_ PCI device (driven by
the saa7134 module) which can handle (among other v4l-related things)
the DMA transfer of mpeg streams.  That can be used in different ways
(or not at all) and the different use cases are handled by the
sub-modules.
So the way it is intended to work is that saa7134 has the pci table and
gets autoloaded by hotplug, it will have a look at the hardware and then
load either saa7134-empress or saa7134-dvb or none of them, so you'll
get everything nicely autoloaded.

Yes, thats exactly the problem.  And this is especially true for the
saa7134-dvb module as this one has a bunch of dependencies to other
modules of the dvb subsystem.  Thats why I try to avoid loading them
if they are not needed.

Well, that will actually work.  You can simply load both saa7134-empress
and saa7134-dvb, the saa7134 core module will take care that they can
only attach to devices they can actually handle.  Drawback is the memory
footprint ...
