BTW: if you'd like an example the sort of thing I'm talking about,
please take a quick look at
  
http://www.fys.uio.no/~trondmy/src/bsdcred/linux-2.5.1-pre11_cred.dif
That was a start at doing credentials POSIX threads. It doesn't have
the 'capabilities' stuff merged into the struct task (the patch itself
is incomplete, out of date, and just as monolithic as yours) but it
does illustrate what I mean about the relationship between the struct
cred and the ucred stuff, and also illustrates how one might share the
struct ucred with the struct file.
Cheers,
