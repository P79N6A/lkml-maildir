The stuff in -mm is a best guess at what's going to be in 2.6.15,
but it's far from exact and certain.

That's a question for Andrew (added to CC in case he's not receiving
enough copies of this mail ;-), and it's too soon to tell - changes
which have only just been exposed in 2.6.14-rc4-mm1 are not yet
mature enough for a judgement.
I've still got stuff to come, to make full sense of what's already in:
if I were Andrew, given the faster releases we're going for now, I'd
currently be in some doubt about whether to push that for 2.6.15.
Perhaps he'll be more comfortable with yours, feel it's the right
way to go, and want to put it ahead of what's presently in -mm.
Or perhaps not.
Hugh
