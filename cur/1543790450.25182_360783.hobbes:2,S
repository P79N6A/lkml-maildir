I am not the fastest typer on Earth, far from it.
I use to have this printed all over the place on my Dell Inspiron 8100
laptop, without really doing anything special with my keyboard....
So I don't know if this was an issue or not, but given that my
keyboard never caused me a trouble, I just brain blacklisted the
message.
Thanks a lot for making this simple yet effective patch :)
Cheers,
Jerome
