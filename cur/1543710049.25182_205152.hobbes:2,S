Martin, have you tried adding this printk?
Andrew, could you take the following patch (even though it didn't fix
the problem).
I think the smp_mb isn't needed because the rl waitqueue stuff is
serialised by the queue spinlocks.
The addition of the smp_mb and the other change is to try to close the
window for races a bit. Obviously they can still happen, it's a racy
interface and it doesn't matter much.
