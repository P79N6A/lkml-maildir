Subject: [PATCH 5/5] direct-io: fix double completion on partially valid async requests
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/11/8/421

If a request which is valid in the first half but has the second half
unmapped, the current code issues the first half and returns issue
error.  This causes both the caller and completion callback complete
the aio request thus either causing oops immediately or memory
corruption.
This path makes direct_io_worker() wait completion for such request
and return error without aio_complete()'ing it.
This bug has been spotted by Chul-Woong Yang.
