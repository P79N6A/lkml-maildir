Hi,
I've been trying all sorts of overlapping testing and I've not gotten the
lockdep warnings any more.  (I do occasionally get that debug object warning
that I mentioned to Thomas, though that comes and goes irregardless of any
patches.)  The two fixes that Rusty did (lose the get_online_cpus() and use
a separate work queue) seems to have relieved work_on_cpu of it's primary
problems, and I've not found any new ones to replace them yet.  ;-)
So I'll "un-push" the entire patchset, and then re-push the x86 only ones,
and send the others to their respective maintainers after fixing the problems
you mentioned.  (Posting patches to the list was way more fun, and less
"committable". ;-)
Thanks,
Mike
