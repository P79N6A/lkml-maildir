That is a pisser.  What brand and model of laptop is this, exactly?
Did you ever use the pcmcia-cs modules on this laptop, and if so, did
they behave the same?  Does this happen with a specific card?  Which
one(s) are you using?  Does it happen if you hot insert the card, or
only if the card is inserted at startup?  What CardBus bridge do you
have (use 'lspci -v')?
As Marcello said, the change was introduced specifically to avoid this
sort of problem, on certain other laptops.
