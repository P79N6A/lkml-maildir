Per-client subscription is not possible since it is the push (multicast)
model we
talk about and delayacct needs tgid.

i can see if an exiting process is the only process in the thread group,
the (not is_thread_group) condition would be true. So, that leaves
multi-threaded applications that are not interested in tgid-data still
receive 2x taskstats data.
Is a system-wide switch that bad? A site  that needs tgid stats can live
with the performance consequence while those do not need tgid can
enjoy a pure per-task stats data. (I would argue that a thread group
is some sort of task aggregate.)
How about sending tgid stats when the last process in the group exist?
But do not send it if not the last in the thread?
Thanks,
