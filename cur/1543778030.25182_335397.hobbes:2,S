The CKRM design explicitly considered this problem of some controllers 
being more unacceptable than the rest and part of the indirections 
introduced in CKRM are to allow the kernel community the flexibility of 
cherry-picking acceptable controllers. So if the current CPU controller 
   implementation is considered too intrusive/unacceptable, it can be 
reworked or (and we certainly hope not) even rejected in perpetuity. 
Same for the other controllers as and when they're introduced and 
proposed for inclusion.
