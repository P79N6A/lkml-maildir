sys_personality will fail if there isn't an exec_domain registered for
the personality you want.  The *whole* *point* of Rusty's patch is to
add an execution domain for x86 emulation so we *can* do sys_personality.
Did you actually look at the patch, or was your mail just a knee-jerk?

for ages.  Anyway, it's not your call.
Paul.
