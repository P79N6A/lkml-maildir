I _hope_ to be still allowed to choose what to do in my spare time. As
just said right now I choose to not send you tunelp patches in my limited
spare time simply because I want to do other kernel things that are taking
my mind busy for all my spare time.
While now I am been amazed reading your email, I won't be surprised if in
the near future you'll tell me that I am rude because I won't donate 1
billion of dollars to you.
