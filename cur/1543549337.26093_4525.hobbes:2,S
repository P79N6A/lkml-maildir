Is the extra code worth it?  The ix86 oops dump runs the stack printing
anything that looks like a kernel address.  This means that we "always"
get the function that wants the lock, we just do not get the precise
address of the call to spinlock().  All right, we do not always get the
current function, sometimes we only get the function that called the
function that call spinlock().  But even that seems to be enough for
oops.
kdb has to go to all the bother of decoding the .text.lock sections to
get an accurate backtrace.  Oops decoding has never pretended to be
accurate, it gets lots of false positives.
BTW, you made the same mistake I did with .text_lock.  The kernel is
not the only place where section .text.lock exists, each module has its
own .text.lock section.  That is one of the reasons that the kdb symbol
table processing needs so much data, to extract sections from modules
and find symbols for return addresses from all the strange out of line
code - man kallsyms for the gory details.

Not as it stands, but yet another regular expression is no big deal.
IMHO the existing oops gives enough data, given the known restrictions
of stack backtraces without full unwind support.
