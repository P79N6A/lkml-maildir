ksymoops doesn't know what modules were loaded at the time
of the crash, and it doesn't know where they were loaded.
The `klogd -x' problem has been with us for *years* and
distributors still persist in turning it on.

It assumes too much.  Arjan has a kksymoops thingy which does the symbol
resolution at crash-time.  This seems much more reliable to me.  It also
handles the common case where the running vmlinux/System.map/etc no longer
exist.

Keith, I have spent a *lot* of time working weird kernel bugs
with people via email.  Usually, things peter out simply because
the other party lacks the expertise or time to keep on doing
things.  So the bug doesn't get fixed.
I would prefer that all this become easier, simpler and more reliable.
We need a damn good reason for deprecating statically linked kernels
and certainly none has been presented yet.
