Well as I say, the tree_lock crash is way more important.  We need to work
out what we're going to do then get that fixed, backport the fix to -stable
then rebase the radix-tree patches on top and get
radix-tree-rcu-lockless-readside.patch tested and reviewed.
I guess we can do all that in time for -rc1, but not knowing _how_ we'll be
fixing the tree_lock crash is holding things up.
Paul, if you could take a close look at the RCU aspects of this work it'd
help, thanks.
btw guys, theory has it that code which was submitted post-2.6.n is too
late for 2.6.n+1..
