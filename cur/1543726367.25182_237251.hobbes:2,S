I can confirm a somewhat similar problem on vanilla x86 2.6.7 kernel
running on an Athlon XP 2000+, EEPro 1000/TX.  Basically, ifconfig
shows all but the first inet6 address.  However, the address is still
recognized by the standard 'ip' program, and can be bound to by
applications as normal.
Uptime is 29 days, and I don't have the luxury of rebooting the box to
see if it clears the issue.
If you need more information on the system, please feel free to let me
know what you need exactly, and I'll get it to you.
