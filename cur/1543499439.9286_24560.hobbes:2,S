Woops, one guy said me that "according to me" looks like the pronouncement
from an oracle.... Please do a s/according to me/as I view it/ over all my
past emails.
"according to me" word by word in Italian is a really nice and friendly
way to express thoughts (and it traduces cleanly to English but it seems
in English is used in a very different way..).
Sorry and please excuse me.

PS. I always appreciate very _much_ English corrections (better privately
to not spam the list :).
