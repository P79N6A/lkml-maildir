I need to re-read your mail and Andrew as at this point, I don't quite
see why we need that args and/or that current->flags bit instead of
always returning all the way to userland and let the faulting
instruction happen again (which means you don't block in the kernel, can
take signals etc... thus do you actually need to prevent multiple
retries ?)
