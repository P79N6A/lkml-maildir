OK, I'll add an (unsigned long long) cast.

OK. The long-term plan is to have other kinds of files also handled by
this function, so eventually it would look something like:
if (cft->read_map) {
...
} else if (cft->read_something_else) {
...
}
...
} else {
  BUG();
}
But I guess I can save that for the future.

The existence of cft->read_map causes us to open a seq_file. Otherwise
we do nothing special and carry on down the normal open path.
