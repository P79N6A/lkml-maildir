I agree that currently fdatasync is just an alias for fsync. But the
manpage seems a bit different:
DESCRIPTION
       fdatasync flushes all data  buffers  of  a  file  to  disk
       (before  the system call returns).  It resembles fsync but
       is not required to update  the  metadata  such  as  access
				  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
       time.
       ^^^^
       Applications  that  access  databases  or  log files often
       write a tiny data fragment (e.g., one line in a log  file)
       and  then  call  fsync immediately in order to ensure that
       the written data is physically  stored  on  the  harddisk.
       Unfortunately, fsync will always initiate two write opera­
       tions: one for the newly written data and another  one  in
       order to update the modification time stored in the inode.
       If the modification time is not a part of the  transaction
       concept  fdatasync  can be used to avoid unnecessary inode
       disk write operations.
The manpage says "the metadata such as" so I thought we could skip all the
metadata (the inode timestamp looked as an example to me). I thought it
would be the application that should know if the last operations changed
the metadata or not. Also I looked Linus's generic_buffer_fdatasync, and I
thought we would only had to call it in the real sys_fdatasync to get
fdatasync working properly on pre-2.3.7.
So if what you said is true (that fdatasync can skip _only_ the
timestamp), then yes, also fdatasync still needs I/O from the buffer
cache.
