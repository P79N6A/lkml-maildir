You don't have a prayer mapping 512 MB at once on an x86-32 machine.
The kernel only has 1 GB of address space *total*.  You either need to
map it in chunks or restrict yourself to 64-bit machines.

No chance.

The vmalloc= option conflicts with the booting protocol, so it's
basically a crapshoot if it's going to work or not, at least if you're
using an initrd, which pretty much everyone does hese days.
