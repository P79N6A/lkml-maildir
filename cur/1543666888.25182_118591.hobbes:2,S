Well, the second test just now didn't work right.
/dev/scsi/host0/bus0/target4/lun0/disc did exist this time around but I got
the same error as before trying to get anything going on it and I can no
longer get the jaz drive to work.  
: So far it's looking good.  I waited until the drive had totally spun down 
: then tried going to it's automount directory and it spun up and mounted fine
