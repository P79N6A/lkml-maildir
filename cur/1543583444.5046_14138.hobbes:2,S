 That's not a right fix.  We should make a check in MP_ioapic_info() and
do not register bogus I/O APICs (hmm, I wonder what the next thing to be
broken in MP-tables is...).  We should handle the no I/O APIC case around
setup_IO_APIC() then.  This would be similar to specifying "noapic"  in
the command line.  There is absolutely no need to disable SMP support if
there is no I/O APIC -- we don't insist on having it.  We are able to
route interrupts through 8259A controllers if needed (we'd better avoid it
if at all possible due to various chip errata, though).
 I'll implement the idea together with my pending APIC clean-ups. 
 We don't handle P4-compatible I/O APICs at the moment, anyway...
