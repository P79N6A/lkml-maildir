FWIW, it never occurs here when the net is under load.  Generally, it's
just when it's idle, and smbmount dies for some reason.  I think that's
where we need to focus--when is smbmount dying, and why?  Is it a result
of something NT does?  /var/log/messages and /var/log/samba/* don't have
a clue as to why it dies.
Maybe it's a problem specific to NT? Or to NT Workstation?  That's what
I have, NT 4.0 WS SP5.  I don't have a Windows machine to test on (thank
God!! It's enough to have it at work!).
Anyhow, I took the smbmount from 2.0.5a and recompiled it.  In the top,
I uncommented the SMBFS_DEBUG portion.  Doesn't really help, I don't
think, but... 
At the beginning of the day yesterday, I mounted a share with the
DEBUG-enabled smbmount, and I mounted another one with the normal
smbmount.  WHen I got home from work, the DEBUG-ed share was still
mounted and up (well, aside from pagefile.sys ;) ).  THe normal smbmount
was out like a broken lamp.  df hung for a bit while it tried to probe
that mount point, then I got the infamous input/output error.  Here's
what happened when I do a df:
Sep 21 08:49:30 reliant kernel: smb_trans2_request: result=-32, setting
invalid
Sep 21 08:49:31 reliant kernel: smb_retry: new pid=19481, generation=7
Sep 21 08:49:31 reliant kernel: smb_lookup: find //pagefile.sys failed,
error=-2
6
Sep 21 08:49:34 reliant kernel: smb_retry: signal failed, error=-3
Sep 21 08:51:50 reliant kernel: smb_retry: signal failed, error=-3
The first part, up to and including the pagefile.sys message, is from
the smbmount with "#define SMBFS_DEBUG 1".  The last two are from the
regular smbmount, or from smbfs trying to awaken the dead normal
smbmount, I guess, is more accurate.
I haven't had time to decode what extra stuff gets done with
SMBFS_DEBUG. There's a bunch of "#ifndef SMBFS_DEBUG"s in there,
though...
I'll probably try to attach a gdb to the regular smbmount tomorrow
morning (no time today), and see what happens.
