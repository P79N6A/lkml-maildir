Hey all,
          How does the ski simulator resolves the dependency on shared
libraries?
              For e.g: I tried 'ls' command on xski but i failed to run it :
[root@basemant /]# xski ls vmlinux simscsi=/var/ski-disks/sd
ls - No such file or directory
ls - No such file or directory
xski: Could not open ls for reading
[root@basemant /]# which ls
alias ls='ls --color=tty'
       /bin/ls
[root@basemant /]# xski /bin/ls vmlinux simscsi=/var/ski-disks/sd
/bin/ls - wrong architecture (3)
xski: Could not open /bin/ls for reading
[root@basemant /]#
Please kindly reply !
