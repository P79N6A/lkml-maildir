Correct, it's perfectly fine to do that on all machines (not just Via).
Users should also set "PNP OS: No" for Linux 2.2...
Other BIOS settings to verify:
Assign IRQ to VGA: no (optional, but you probably don't need a VGA IRQ)
Operating System: other (or Unix, depending on the BIOS)
Memory hole: no
Unless you are using ISA cards, make sure all your PCI plug-n-play
IRQ settings are set to "PCI/PnP" not "ISA/ICU".
hmmm, maybe I should write a Linux kernel BIOS guide/FAQ...
