What do you even need windows for?  If you use the framebuffer system (not
so common on x86, very common elsewhere) you can extract more then enough
info to setup X.  Check out 
http://devel.linuxppc.org/~trini
 (Yes, it
mentions 0.3, which isn't up, will be RSN).  You can get all the video
settings you need w/ a few ioctls.  Setting up keyboard/mouse stuff is
currently being done (w/o user intervention, a plus for ease of use) by
reading /etc/sysconfig/{keyboard,mouse} (I'd be very happy to take patches
for debian/anythingelseouthere).
