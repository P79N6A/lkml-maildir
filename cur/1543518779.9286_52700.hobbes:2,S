No, as I said in a later message, the results of subsequent testing with sack
on/off were not as I expected.  I will do more testing when I get a chance.

The problems I've seen are very sensitive to characteristics that are
unclear.  A connection from a single Windows system (running either NT or 98,
doesn't matter) to a Linux system on one network works fine, while one on
another network pretty consistently fails.  Both Linux sustems are running
out-of-the-box RH 6.1 on Pentium-II SMP hardware.  One is 400 Mhz; the other
is 450 MHz.  More later.
