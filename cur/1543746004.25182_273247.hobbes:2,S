Ok, that at least means it's not a regression, although it may be that the 
altered behaviour is enough to make some program work/not-work depending 
on exactly what it is testing. My example is certainly not the only way to 
try to mess up a debugger.
I'm by no means 100% sure that we should encourage the kind of programming 
"skills" I showed with that example program, so in that sense this may not 
be worth worrying about. That said, I do hate the notion of having 
programs that are basically undebuggable, so from a QoI standpoint I'd 
really like to say that you can run my horrid little program under the 
debugger and see it work...
