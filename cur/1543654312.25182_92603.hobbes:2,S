You conveniently cut of the important part of my message:
	Remember that most compatibility syscalls go straight to the
	64-bit syscall handlers.  You're probably hosed anyhow if a
	64-bit syscall returns, say, 0x1ffffffff, but on ia64 I'd
	still rather play it safe and consistently have all
	compatibility syscalls return a 64-bit sign-extended value
	like all other syscall handlers ("least surprise" principle).
I have zero interest debugging subtle bugs of this sort.  If "long"
isn't an option, we should add a platform-specific compat32_retval_t
or whatever.
