I was really talking about something stable. HAL is an application, and 
as such has to be changed avery time some developer has a bad dream and 
changes the interface, moves a comtrol or report from /proc to /sys, or 
otherwise requires a new way of interpreting the data. If you will, HAL 
*in* the kernel where it must work.
