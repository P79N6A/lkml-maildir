Good.

Yeah, I was thinking that too. But maybe there's some way of stopping
PIT interrupts while keeping APIC timer interrupts running on all chips.
It seems to work OK on my P3 boxes, but seems to fail on newer machines.
BTW, stopping PIT interrupts (like the HRT VST patch does) seems to
kill APIC timer interrupts too, the same way as reprogamming PIT does.
Or maybe there's something else that needs to be done to get APIC
interrupts going after PIT interrupts are disabled.
