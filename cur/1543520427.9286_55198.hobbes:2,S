	I just had a look at the latest ratified version of the TWAIN standard, and
the structures are only specified for Windows and Macintosh. So while some
people might call something else TWAIN, it's always possible the TWAIN group
will later ratify a different structure.
	Unless there's been some agreement with the TWAIN group, it's misleading to
call anything that isn't part of the ratified standard 'TWAIN'.
