At the first glance, I have to agree with Nick. All the customer wants is a
mechanism to specify group these cpus together for scheduling...
But looking at how cpusets interact with sched-domains and especially for
large systems, it will probably be useful if we export the topology through /sys

yes.
Robin, Right now everyone is calling arch_init_sched_domain() with
cpu_online_map. We can remove this argument and in the presence of cpusets,
this routine can go through exclusive cpusets and partition the domains
accordinly. Otherwise we can simply build one domain partition with
cpu_online_map.
