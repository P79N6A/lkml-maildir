At this point I suspect SMP (of hyperthreaded variety, perhaps).
I must admit there's little chance I might be able to look at this
in detail. Do this... get dmesg, /proc/interrupts, /proc/bus/usb/devices,
/proc/cpuinfo. The /var/log/messages is a substitute for dmesg,
but we'll need a complete one. Send it to
linux-usb-devel@lists.sourceforge.net and
perhaps cc: to mdharm-usb at one-eyed-alien not net.
nForce is known to be kinky, although I cannot quite put my
finger on it.
