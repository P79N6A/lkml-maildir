1. modprobe agpgart loads OK :
Nov 27 11:34:47 localhost kernel: Linux agpgart interface v0.99 (c) Jeff 
Hartmann
Nov 27 11:34:47 localhost kernel: agpgart: Maximum main memory to use 
for agp memory: 439M
Nov 27 11:34:47 localhost kernel: agpgart: Detected an Intel 830M, but 
could not find the secondary device.

2. compared to Stephan's original patches ("if i830m_dev ..." and 
"break;") :
Nov 27 11:37:07 localhost kernel: Linux agpgart interface v0.99 (c) Jeff 
Hartmann

Is the 8 megs of GART OK ?
Is the memory benchmark comparable to equally equipped machines (1.2G 
P-III(M), i830(MP), ATI Radeon(M)) ? (I'm trying to differentiate my 
performance problem between agpgart and X DRI/DRM).
Kind regards,
Didier
