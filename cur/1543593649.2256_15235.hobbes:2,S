Okay, I've had some problems with the VM on my machine, what is the most 
usefull way to compile reports for you?  I have modified the kernel for a few 
different ports fixing bugs, and device drivers, etc., but the VM is all 
greek to me, I can just see that caching is hyper aggressive and doesn't look 
like it's going back to the pool..., which results in sluggish performance.  
Now I know from the work that I've done that anecdotal information is almost 
never even remotely usefull.  Therefore is there any body of information that 
I can read up on to create a usefull set of data points for you or other VM 
hackers to look at?  (Or maybe some report in the past that you thought was 
especially usefull?)
Thank You,
Shane Nay.
(I have in the past had many problems with the VM on embedded machines as 
well, but I'm not actively working on any right this second..., though my 
Psion is sitting next to me begging for me to run some VM tests on it :)
