When I use KPowersave and click on "Suspend to RAM", my laptop Toshiba 
M45-S355 "sleep" and "wake-up" very well, but LCD Brightness is changed 
to MAX (I hate this "sunshine" on my eyes).
One more detail: Kernel Linux don't have control of lcd brightness, so I 
need use omnibook driver to do this (<
http://omnibook.sourceforge.net
>).

Renato
