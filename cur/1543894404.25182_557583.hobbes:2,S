Come on, GPL is software licence, the hardware isn't part of the
equation. One can argue that keys are or aren't part of the source
(= that digital signature is or isn't part of the executable) but
it's totally independent of any hardware and its purpose.
For example, it doesn't matter if the signature is merely for checking
file integrity (and any signature would do) or if it's for restricting
users from running something.
