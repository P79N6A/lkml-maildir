You could always try it yourself, but ...
Same .config, on a Pentium III (Coppermine) 1090 Bogomips, 2.4.18 SMP
kernel booted with maxcpus=1, mem=32M.
kbuild 2.4:
 	make oldconfig dep bzImage modules     15:11
 	make bzImage modules (no changes)	0:33
kbuild 2.5:
 	make oldconfig installable		13:33
 	make installable (no changes)		 0:33
Even at 32MB, kbuild 2.5 is slightly faster.
