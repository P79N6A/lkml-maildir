[ snip list of reasons that people like to work against the stable kernel ]
So, in essence what you're saying is that you'd like (by proxy - I note
that you're not offering to implement anything) to work against a kernel
which isn't changing much.
For this to happen, you have to assume that nobody else is working on the
stable kernel.  Exactly one patch, then, can be developed against the
stable kernel.  Why the hell should it be yours?
And then, once your checkpointing patch has been folded into 2.even, you
have to get it put into 2.odd as well, or it disappears under the next
stable kernel.

Firstly, get it into an acceptable form.  If the author isn't prepared to
do it, offer him money, do it yourself, or convince somebody else to do
it (offer me money, for example).
You can't get away from this.  Why should Linus/Alan/other kernel patch
hoovers have to merge an old patch without the help of its author?
Secondly, since it does touch on core code and functionality, collect
evidence that it works.  Get the maintainers of the subsystems which it
affects to OK it.
Third, at an appropriate time (ie. not during feature/code freeze) offer
it up to Linus.  Again, for a non-trivial patch which affects core
functionality, show evidence (or at least claim) that it will be
maintained and fixed in a responsible and timely manner.
There's nothing particularly complicated about this.  IMO, only someone
who has never worked on a non-trivial piece of software could think that
this process is opaque.
Matthew.
