Subject: schedule check_region for removal ?
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/9/16/92

its apparently been deprecated for a long time
http://lkml.org/lkml/2003/6/12/100
But its still used, notably in drivers/scsi/BusLogic.c
And jumping the gun a bit, theres a number of "got rid of check_region" 
comments,
which now belong in the changelog. Do these also get deleted ?
