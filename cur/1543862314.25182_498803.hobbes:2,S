Hi,
I just build a 2.6.19.1 vanilla kernel based on the previous config
(make oldconfig) but for some reason it is not starting. Despite
following the usual procedure with lilo like many times before it seems
that lilo tries to boot it and jumps back to the menu screen.
But selecting the old kernel boots just fine.
Any one can advise on what could cause such behaviour beside the obvious
 steps like did i run lilo after kernel compile, check paths ...
Thanks
Mark
