I think the above is easier to read than the below.  Macros can obscure
sometimes, and one of our weaknesses is a tendency to use macros in such
a way that it frustrates meta-. use in emacs.   Nikita did however
mention that there was something that could understand macros when
constructing tags files, but I forgot what that was.
