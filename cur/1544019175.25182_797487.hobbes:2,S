The fact that the boot cpu area is moved isn't new.  It's been that
way for a while.  The reason it is moved is so that extra space can be
allocated at the end for dynamic allocations.  It looks like Xen just
avoided it by not loading the per-cpu GDT until after the copy.  I
guess you could get by without reloading the GDT, but you would still
need to set MSR_GS_BASE for 64-bit.  32-bit happens to work because
%fs is probably initialized to the same segment as %ds.  If 32-bit
were ever to switch to zero-based per-cpu like 64-bit, that assumption
would fail.
You need to add __per_cpu_load to the offset to get the address of the
variable in the original boot per-cpu area.
