You'll need to use the kernel parameter 
(Documentation/kernel-parameters.txt) snd-sb16 .
Looking at the docs in the Documentation/sound/alsa directory:
  Module snd-sb16 and snd-sbawe
  -----------------------------
    Module for 16-bit SoundBlaster cards: SoundBlaster 16 (PnP),
                                          SoundBlaster AWE 32 (PnP),
                                          SoundBlaster AWE 64 PnP
    port        - port # for SB DSP 4.x chip (0x220,0x240,0x260)
    mpu_port    - port # for MPU-401 UART (0x300,0x330), -1 = disable
    awe_port    - base port # for EMU8000 synthesizer (0x620,0x640,0x660)
                   (snd-sbawe module only)
    irq         - IRQ # for SB DSP 4.x chip (5,7,9,10)
    dma8        - 8-bit DMA # for SB DSP 4.x chip (0,1,3)
    dma16       - 16-bit DMA # for SB DSP 4.x chip (5,6,7)
    mic_agc     - Mic Auto-Gain-Control - 0 = disable, 1 = enable (default)
    csp         - ASP/CSP chip support - 0 = disable (default), 1 = enable
    isapnp      - ISA PnP detection - 0 = disable, 1 = enable (default)
   
    Module supports up to 8 cards, autoprobe and ISA PnP.
    Note: To use Vibra16X cards in 16-bit half duplex mode, you must
          disable 16bit DMA with dma16 = -1 module parameter.
          Also, all Sound Blaster 16 type cards can operate in 16-bit
          half duplex mode through 8-bit DMA channel by disabling their
          16-bit DMA channel.
And at the end of the sb16.c file I found:
#ifndef MODULE
/* format is: snd-sb16=enable,index,id,isapnp,
                       port,mpu_port,fm_port,
                       irq,dma8,dma16,
                       mic_agc,csp,
                       [awe_port,seq_ports]
Which is probably what format you'll need to use but I don't know much 
about drivers...;-)
I don't know what "id" stands for either...
Good luck!
