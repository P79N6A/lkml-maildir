I think what worries me is the controllers on the motherboard. An example
might be what one of my motherboards does on boot:
PIIX: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev 38
PIIX: not 100% native mode: will probe IRQ's later
...
PIIX: device not capable of full native PCI mode
...
That is why I think it might vary from one motherboard to the next IF you
are also using the built-in IDE interfaces and that is what the original
poster seemed to want to do.
