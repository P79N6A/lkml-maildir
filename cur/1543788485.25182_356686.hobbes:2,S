Hi,
   After some more toying around, I have seen that it works correctly
on ext2 fs but not
on etx3. :) ...
  My questions inline ..

But even if I'm reading blocks from a device directly, they are
finally blocks from  the same inode. Why then are they stored
separately ?

Is there then a safe way to do it w/o going through the filesystem caching ?
If not, I guess the following steps will be required :
a) Find out the page in the mapping corresponding to the blocks I need
to write.
b) Lock the page. Make changes. Mark it dirty and sync write it ?
Is there something in the kernel which does this already ?
Thanks for the help :) !
