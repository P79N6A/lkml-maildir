I am having the same problems with the siimage driver as those posted in 
the thread "siimage driver status".  Also I read all the posts on the 
siimage driver.
My motherboard is an Abit NF7-S rev2.0, nforce2 chipset and SIL3112A 
controller.  I tried the "hdparm -d1 -X66 /dev/hde" trick but I get the 
dma timer error, siimage reset message, and the system repeats these 
messages.  Finally, after a long delay I get all kinds of io errors 
reported from my ext3 journal and filesystem.  At this point I have to 
reset the system and reboot, back into the PIO mode.  I don't know 
anything else to try.  Help.
I am running the 2.4.21 kernel.
I will send any additional info required if I can, and act as a test 
case for the Abit NF7-S board.  Most posts seem to be on the Asus mobo.
