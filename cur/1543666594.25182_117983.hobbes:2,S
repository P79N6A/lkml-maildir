tell me how to get the data and metadata out of the SCCS files for
changeset 1.786.202.5 like in the below:
	
http://linux.bkbits.net:8080/linux-2.5/user=akpm/patch@1.786.202.5?nav=
!-|index.html|stats|!+|index.html|ChangeSet@-6M|cset@1.786.202.5
then tell me how to find the number "1.786.202.5" watching the SCCS
history of kernel/timer.c.
SCCS provides per-file info, not the global metadata of the tree. That
other information is stored in a proprietary format that the bitbucket
project is trying to parse. CVS exports the whole info in a open format,
this is why it's so much better than trying to parse the proprietary
format that can be changed anyways to compressed and maybe encrypted
format too.
