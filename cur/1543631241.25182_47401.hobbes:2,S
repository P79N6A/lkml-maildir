I already asked this question but did not get any responses. Please
condider answering.
Using the old i8259 interrupts controller, my 1-way Linux2.4.16 box
livelocks when receiving a high rate UDP flow (interrupt rate is so
high that the NET_RX_SOFTIRQ never gets the chance to pull the
packets off the backlog queue). However, the receive livelock
phenomenom completely disappears when making use of the IO-APIC.
Does anyone have an explanation for this?
TIA
