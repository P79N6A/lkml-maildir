It sounds to me more like Pekka is thinking of checkpointing support. If
that's the case, then remounting filesystems isn't going to be an
option. You want to freeze them for just long enough so that you can
determine what needs saving in the checkpoint. You certainly don't want
to make rw file handles ro and so on.
