2.4.4+ supports fragmented packets and packet lists.
You're probably seeing the 8K allocation problem for incoming packets which need to be
allocated by the driver on interrupt time with GFP_ATOMIC. GFP_ATOMIC memory is limited.
The 2.4 VM unfortunately has no way to keep more GFP_ATOMIC free ATM and tune for heavy
interrupt load (2.2 allowed this by increasing the freepages sysctl). Hopefully this VM bug 
will be fixed in the not too far future.
A workaround in the driver would be to use the 2.4.4 fragmented buffers 
(of course you'll still run into GFP_ATOMIC limits without manual tuning)
or allocate RX memory from a thread with GFP_KERNEL.
