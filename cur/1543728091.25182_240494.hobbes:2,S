Okay, these also failed as replacements for printk():
(c) local_irq_enable();
(d) local_irq_enable(); set_current_state(TASK_RUNNING);
	schedule(); mdelay(1000);
(e) local_irq_enable(); set_current_state(TASK_RUNNING);
	for (i = 0; i < 1000; ++i) mdelay(1);
	set_current_state(TASK_RUNNING); schedule();
