In the USSA it is arguable that wireless might need it (if done in
software) for certain properties. (The argument being it must be
tamperproof to random end consumers). Obviously an electronics graduate
can tamper with hardware ones just as well
The USSA also has interesting rules about some other technologies
including GPS on national security grounds.
