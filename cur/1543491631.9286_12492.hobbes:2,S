hey can someone help me?  I compiled the new linux kernel (2.2.4 I
think) but now when I try to use my modem it thinks it is "busy".  This
is definitly a problem with the new kernel because when I go back to my
old kernel everything is fine.
PS
I tried a command like "cu -l /dev/ttyS3" among others.
