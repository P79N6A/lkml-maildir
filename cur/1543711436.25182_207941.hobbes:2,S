What is it you need exactly?

Is this the case for your setup or is this something true in general.
I like to add data fields that could be used by everyone.

Are these the fields you need in general?

I have thought about it. That is why I toke so long to reply. I think the 
best approach is that we create a database of struct fb_monspecs for LCD
panels. In struct fb_monspecs we have the following fields.
manufacturer[4]
monitor[14]
serial_no[14]
ascii[14]	For expansion.
We can have it so that we can pass in a monitor string that can be used to 
select the proper LCD panel in the database. How does that sound?
