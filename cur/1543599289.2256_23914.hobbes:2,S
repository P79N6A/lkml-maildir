Looks like a good one.
Actually, I got two wishes for 2.4.10:
* It hopefully overcomes all the VM trouble
  (this list is full of reports; some of my observation look like creating
   dirty pages in the page cache at a high rate makes your system crawl.
   An efficient way is use mkfs with Andrea's blkdev-pgcache patch, but
   it's not the only way.)
* It'll hopefully be identical to 2.5.0,
  so people have a kernel to put experimental stuff in instead of 2.4.x
  Good things can always be backported, once proven stable.
