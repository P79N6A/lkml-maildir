Why not change the "2.6 prefix" to 2.8, 3.0 (or whatever) if/when you
do go to a new naming scheme --- simply to make a clean break between
the new and the old.  Plus it will give the suckdork crowd[1] bigger
numbers to drivel on about.
That said it would be a large numerical leap without and real feature
changes so perhaps that will further add to confusion?
Sigh.
