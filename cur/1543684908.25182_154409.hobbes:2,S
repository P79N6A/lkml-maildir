Your just kidding, don't you?
Definition of "problem" here is: service got corrupted. It is really of 
_no_ interest if the data that was corrupted is "sensitive" or "nonsensitive",
because the only cure in both versions is rewriting from scratch (and dumping
the server of course).
So your possible downtime is just as big in both ways. And nothing else counts.

I don't, because it is simply impossible. If you are root on a webserver
everything is lost, no matter if your data is local or nfs-mounted you can
delete, relink or whatever you like at will.
The only thing you _can't_ do is access data that is not exported to your
hacked system. And that's exactly what I am trying to do: don't give any more
data away than absolutely necessary.

Stephan
