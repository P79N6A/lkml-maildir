In another thread (about the ucb1x00) we came up with the idea of
drivers/mfd (mfd = multi function devices).
The core and platform specific parts would live here with suitable clear
naming and the subsection specific parts that were separable would live
in the appropriate place within the kernel.
Just another idea to add to the mix and removes the dilemma of a
multifunction device with isn't platform based...
