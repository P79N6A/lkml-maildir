In standard C, declarations must precede statements in a block. When the
#if is true, the declaration is exposed, and it is after an assignment,
a syntax error.
The most general solution is to always open a new block if you need a
declaration, but here the code fragment is small enough to not do so
(but one needs to be alert).
#if ...
{
	int	x;
	x = ...
}
#endif
