My first thought is that perhaps the filesystem has shut down due to 
some error (memory corruption, bad disk, xfs bug...); did you check your 
log messages?
Justin, when you mentioned that you used xfs' fsck, I guess you used 
xfs_repair.  Was the log clean when you ran it, or did you force repair 
to zero out the log?  That could explain the large lost+found/ when you 
were done...
Patrick, can you reproduce on a non-gentoo kernel?  That'd be the first 
step for this audience.
