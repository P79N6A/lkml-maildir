So what is a coder to do.  We need to define the pi_mutex_trylock().  If
I understand this thread, it should return 0 on success.  Is this
correct?

Have looked more into this now... 
tasklet_trylock is also wrong (but there are only four of them) 
Is this 2.4 only, or where there spin locks earlier too? 
My suggestion now is a few steps: 
1) to release a kernel version that has corrected _trylocks; 
    spin2_trylock and tasklet2_trylock. 
    [with corresponding updates in as many places as possible: 
      s/!spin_trylock/spin2_trylock/g 
      s/spin_trylock/!spin2_trylock/g 
      . . .] 
    (ready for spin trylock, not done for tasklet yet..., attached, 
     hope it got included OK - not fully used to kmail) 
2) This will in house only drives or compilations that in some 
    strange way uses this calls... 
3a) (DANGEROUS) global rename spin2_trylock to spin_trylock 
     [no logic change this time - only name] 
3b) (dangerous) add compatibility interface 
     #define spin_trylock(L) (!spin2_trylock(L)) 
     Probably not necessary since it can not be linked against. 
     Binary modules will contain their own compatibility code :-) 
     Probably preferred by those who maintain drivers for several 
     releases; 2.2, 2.4, ... 
3c) do not do anything more... 
Alternative: 
1b) do nothing at all - suffer later
