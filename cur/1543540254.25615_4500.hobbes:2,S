Unfortunately your suggestion does not work - I just tried it - and with a
good reason: if the code worked in the first place we would never go
inside that "if" at all (or, in other words, there should be no reconnect
events on a notebook while using bultin keyboard and mouse)
I haven't thought about keyboard switches, sorry.. Perhaps, for now, the
best alternative is an extra option in the kernel configuration "Support
for keyboard/mouse switches" with explanation that it breaks Synaptics
touchpads..
Is there any other way to determine reconnect event ?
