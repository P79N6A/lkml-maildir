So I understand the point about filesystems and values that always happen
to be a power of two where the compiler can't know that.
However:

In my case, it is simple "long long" arithmetic.  Shifts, ANDs, ORs,
comparisons, etc.  Not even any addition (which should be pretty efficient
with the HW carry bit on X86).  I don't know why:
	if (a == b)
is inlined, but
	switch a {
	   case b:
	}
isn't.  It's been pointed out to me that my compiler is old (egcs-2.91.66),
and that may be the problem.
I don't see an advantage to having equality expressions work, but not
switches.  There is nothing gained in forcing people to change switch
to if . . . else . . . else . . . .  I do see an advantage to not having
division.
I definitely don't see an advantage to forcing synthetic 64 bit types
(the C code for 64 bit file offsets would be painful).
Anyway, I've probably belabored this enough.
