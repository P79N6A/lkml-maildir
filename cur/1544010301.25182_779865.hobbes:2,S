Thank you, John. I don't mind either way.
I tried hard not to introduce any breakage with this patch, but I have
not cross-compiled it for anything except SuperH. So please test your
platform. Let me know if I managed to break something and I'll fix
things up.
I'm not sure exactly how and when this patch should be applied, but I
assume it's fairly late in the in the merge window?
I guess the liklieness of breakage will increase over time from now
on, so when the time is right please ping me and I'll up-port this
patch straight away.
Thank you.
