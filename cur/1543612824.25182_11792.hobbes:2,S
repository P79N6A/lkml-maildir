Both cdroms are accounted, but only into the same slot (11,0). In function
disk_index() at the end of include/linux/genhd.h, you can add a line
	case SCSI_CDROM_MAJOR:
above the line containing SCSI_DISK0_MAJOR, and things will work as expected.
Several more complete patches have been floating around for a while.

Daniel.
