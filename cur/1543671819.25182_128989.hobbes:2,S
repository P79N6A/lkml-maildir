That won't work, because the scheduler will keep re-selecting the yielding 
task if it's interactive.  I tried this yesterday.  (besides, don't you 
need to set_tsk_need_resched(current) there?)  An easy way to see it not 
work as expected, is to change CHILD_PENALTY to 99, and add 
current->sleep_avg=MAX_SLEEP_AVG  to sched_init() before 
wake_up_forked_process().  Your next boot will 100% guaranteed hang while 
starting ksoftirqd until the parent gets expired.  You'll read "POSIX 
conformance testing by UNIFIX" until then :)
