Mostly solved the colour problem at 16bpp (black background but pale
blue text - had previously been white). At 32bpp just as before -
oversized and yellow.
At 24bpp much as before too - all against black but two boot logos in
greenish shade and everything doubled up on screen in greenish shade
(ie around half of pixels in console text message on left, around half
in repeat on right).
But certainly better at 16bpp
Can mess about with it later to see if I can get the colours right I suppose.
