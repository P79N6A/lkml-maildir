The huge number of oopses never hit the logs.
They either hit early in boot before syslog is even running, or
they kill the box.

This is exactly the problem this patch addresses.
The 'scroll keys' do not work in cases where we lock up after an oops.
If the useful parts of the oops scrolled off the top of the screen, we've
lost any chance of debugging whatever just happened.

The real-world disagrees with you. In the few weeks it's been in Fedora,
several previously undiagnosable oopses were caught, and even *users*
agreed it was a useful addition.   If the two minutes is excessive, we can
lower it, or even make it a boot-option.
Another possibility is instantly continuing after a keypress.

See the other patch which halves the number of lines needed for a backtrace.
With that, even if the user is running 25 line high displays, we've
a pretty good chance it'll fit except for really long backtraces,
and if that's the case, we can ask users to try to reproduce after
 booting with vga=1, (or better, vga=791 for eg).

If we've just oopsed, the console may have no awareness of what day it is,
yet alone anything about video modes. I'm not entirely sure what you're
suggesting, but it gives me the creeps. Are you talking about switching
away from X back to a tty when we oops?
