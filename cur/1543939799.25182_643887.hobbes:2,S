Hi Ingo,
Starting X (autostarted with GDM) manages to lock up my system
(requiring a hard reset) after the first few tree merges of the window,
and bisection shows:
-----------------
19ef9309273d26cb005cb23e6a370353dca91099 is first bad commit
commit 19ef9309273d26cb005cb23e6a370353dca91099
Author: Ingo Molnar <mingo@elte.hu>

    printk: use ktime_get()
    printk timestamps: use ktime_get().
    Some platforms have a functioning clocksource function only after
    they are done with early bootup, so delay this until out of
    SYSTEM_BOOTING state.
    it's also inherently safe now, as any bugs in this area will be
    caught by the printk recursion checks.

-----------------
as the first bad commit.  I have no idea why that would cause problems,
so it could also be some timing-related problem that just happened to
bisect to this patch.
I will try advancing to the head of Linus' tree and then reverting this
patch to make sure it fixes the problem, but I figured I'd send this
first to see if it is obvious to anyone.
