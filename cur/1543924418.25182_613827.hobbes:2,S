The sizeof(struct device) is way too big, especially in the network device case.
We want to support 1000's of device's and the change from class_device to
net_device has caused needless bloat.
sizeof(struct device) = 272
sizeof(struct class_device) = 92
  * not the class_id in class_device could also be removed or changed to
     a ptr, since it is redundant for net_devices.
