NET_IP_ALIGN should be fine in sis190_alloc_rx_skb() as it only
applies to the skb where the driver memcopies (i.e. it is not
limited by the alignement requirement of the asic).

They are directly given to the upper layer. The driver tags a hole in the
Rx ring.

Did the sis190 driver report a link change event ?
