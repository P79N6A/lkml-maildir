And the call entry is meant to be handled in whatever mechanism hypervisor
prefers for its entry points (ABI constraints notwithstanding) as in,
arbitrary software interrupt, or call gate, etc?  I guess for transparent
it has to, since those would be local calls.   Quite similar to the
hypercall entry point that Xen places on the hypercall_page, so easily
compatible.

The document is slightly more descriptive.  The above reserved slots
are shown as:
	char		reserved[32];
	char		elfHeader[64];
But that's only 3 (0-2).  I think I'm missing some small bit of magic.

That comment eludes me.  Are 0-3 special somehow (IOW, I thought it was
just 0-2 as per above), and is it suggesting int 0x80?

Probably not the best format for keeping changelog entries.  Although
it's worth keeping the info somehwere in documentation perhaps.
