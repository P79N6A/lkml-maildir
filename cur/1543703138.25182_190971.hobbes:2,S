Hello.
I use pxegrub to boot a kernel + initrd from network. I want to support 
many (very old to very new) hardware. I like the idea of the multiboot 
spec, where grub can load single modules per tftp from server and 
extend the kernel in this way.
Now with kernel version 2.6 initramfs is upcoming, but I didn't found 
useful documentation of initramfs' possibilities and how to use them.
Could a bootloader decide with modules to append to the kernel?
If yes how?
TIA,
	Tobias
