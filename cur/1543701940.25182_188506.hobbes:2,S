Yes, I've read your analysis several years ago already and I'm the first
one lobbying for epoll, but look at the posting stating, that INN sucks
under Linux currently, but doesn't suck that hard under FreeBSD and
Solaris.
There are already enough things you cannot do properly under Linux
(which are mostly not Linux' fault, but still), so I don't want to add
another one. Especially in the server market, where the M$ lobbyists are
growing their market share.
But if there is some minimal funding available (50 EUR?), I would do it
myself and push the patches upstream ;-)
Regards
Ingo Oeser
