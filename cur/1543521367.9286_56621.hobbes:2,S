Industrial use of Linux usually doesn't involve the kernels
which are marked as `development', ie. where the `middle'
version number is odd and where major things are expected
to change.
People venturing out on that terrain can know what they're
heading into (see 
http://kt.linuxcare.com/
) and shouldn't
come whining when some actual development happens in the
development branch of the kernel. The should only whine
when development stops, not when useful changes are taking
place...
cheers,
Rik
