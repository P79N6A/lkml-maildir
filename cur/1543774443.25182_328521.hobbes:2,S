I had always asked for the simpler and minimal /dev to let a system boot
and reach udev start, and I think this is even better !!

I got sad when I read I did not support directories and so on, because
that meant I could not run udev on it, but I have thought
on an alernative for early userspace:
- mount ndevfs on /mnt
- cp -a /mnt /dev
- umount /mnt
- let init run /etc/rc.d/rc till it gets to mount /dev and start udev
Just a question (kinda newbie's question):
Does ndevfs to be mounted when a device is detected ? Or will it show
all the registered devices when mounted ?
TIA
