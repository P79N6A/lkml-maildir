Same problem here. OK unsetting the CONFIG_DEBUG_RT_LOCKING_MODE.
I have another problem :
I can't boot. 
With 47-15 I had the following with dmesg :
...

Now I have this with 48-01 :
Intel machine check reporting enabled on CPU#1.
CPU1: Intel P4/Xeon Extended MCE MSRs (12) available
CPU1: Thermal monitoring enabled

Is it a problem or a CONFIG parameter ?
