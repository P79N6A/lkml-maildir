I've resynced the staircase cpu scheduler v9.1 with linux-2.6.10-rc2.
http://ck.kolivas.org/patches/2.6/2.6.10/2.6.10-rc2/2.6.10-rc2_to_staircase9.1.diff
Note that a minute change from version 9.0 to v9.1 caused a massive 
change in the behaviour of frequently waking tasks that could get stuck 
at lowest priority for a while in all versions of the staircase 
scheduler has been fixed. This causes quite large improvements in 
fairness, latency and behaviour of high performance gaming with more 
stable and slightly higher fps and better audio behaviour. (note this 
change is already present in 2.6.9-ck3).
Cheers,
Con
