Hi,
I originally started using the 2.1 series because of the 2048-byte per
sector support (none of the 2.0.x patches worked for me, for whatever
reason). One thing I noticed though was that all operations on the MO media
were absolutely horribly slow, copying _from_ a medium went at about
400-500k/second where it should be capable of at least three times as much.
(I know that writing is slower, and why - but reading should be a bit faster
shouldn't it?)
I noticed that the drive LED only flashes from time to time, although the
transfer is constant (the file size of a file being copied steadily grows).
This might be a verify when writing, but what is it when reading?
This applies to VFAT and ext2 formatted media - whereas in ext2 formatted
media, whenever there was a medium error, the machine would almost always
hang in endless bus resets (this stopped after a few minutes when using VFAT
formats).
EPOX MVP3E-M with AMD K62-300 (also tested with P100 on an ASUS board), IDE
both disabled in BIOS.
The MO drive is at SCSI ID 2. I had a Tekram DC-390 (AMD chip) and now have
a Tekram DC-390F (NCR chip). SCSI (disk) support in kernel, raw/cdrom/..
support as module.
Tried kernels: 2.1.[105,108,115,119,128,129,131,131ac10]
