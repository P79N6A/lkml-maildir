I was originally thinking the registrations are global (for all memory)
and not per process. Per process or per VMA seems reasonable to me.

openib.org folks can find the IOPROC patch for 2.6.12-rc3 archived here:

This won't be a problem until someone at a large national lab tries
to connect two "legacy" fabrics together.
