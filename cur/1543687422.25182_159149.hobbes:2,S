Hi
So had this compile error :
setup.c: In function `parse_cmdline_early':
setup.c:830: `skip_ioapic_setup' undeclared (first use in this function)
setup.c:830: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
setup.c:830: for each function it appears in.)
Since just in arch/i386/kernel/io_apic.c, skip_ioapic_setup is declared
and in arch/i386/kernel/Makefile we have
obj-$(CONFIG_X86_IO_APIC)       += io_apic.o
I think this is the correct patch.
thanks
