We don't care about the latest version, so the link neither helps nor hurts 
us. What's needed is that the URL and the MD5 sum for a version in the book 
don't change, and that LFS developers have a reasonable time (say, two 
weeks) to react to version updates. We don't want every other SVN commit to 
the book source to be a version update of man-pages :)
E.g., currently, the book at 
http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/view/development/chapter03/packages.html
 
says:
  Man-pages (2.56) - 1,764 KB:
     Download: 
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/docs/manpages/man-pages-2.56.tar.bz2
     MD5 sum: 4144874a924b0a8d1f67e19f70d13f08
The script parses this information out of the XML source of the book, 
downloads the package and installs it according to the instructions found 
elsewhere in the book.
The script (jhalfs) and the book can be downloaded from svn:
svn co svn://svn.linuxfromscratch.org/ALFS/jhalfs/trunk jhalfs
svn co svn://svn.linuxfromscratch.org/LFS/trunk/BOOK lfs
