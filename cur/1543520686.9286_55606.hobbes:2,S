Aha, maybe that's why my i486 laptop gets 1001.2 ms and 3.0 ms
alternatingly over local Ethernet.  I run rc5des and the ping.
Packets:

--- moving.m-l.org ping statistics ---
17 packets transmitted, 17 packets received, 0% packet loss
round-trip min/avg/max = 1.7/408.5/1001.9 ms
What was particularly interesting was I ran ping, and then suspended it.  I
completely lost networking to the box.  The ping time when I resumed the
ping was 28 seconds.  Networking returned to normal and interactive use
never changed.  I can do it repeatedly too.
That's a very odd way to DoS a box...
