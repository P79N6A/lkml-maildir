Yes, that is what I thought too.

Is set to Y.  Changed it to N and recompiled kernel and restarted.   
No change.  Same problems remain.
I now realise that not only SCSI drive device nodes are not appearing  
in /dev, but all disc nodes are not appearing.
In my case all of fd0, hde (IDE disc), hdf (CD/DVD), sda (SCSI disc),  
sdb (SATA disc), sdc (memory card reader), and their accompanying  
partition nodes, do not get made in /dev.
I'm not familiar with sysfs so don't know what what I should be  
looking for in particular, but I did have a quick noisy around /sys  
and noted that the above mentioned devices are all appearing at /sys/ 
block with what appeared to be sensible information in the  
subdirectories thereof.
Sorry, but it is unlikely that I'll be able to look further into this  
problem at the moment as I am running a conference this week and the  
storm is about to hit...
Cheers
Michael.
