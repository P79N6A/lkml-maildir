Quite.  I've already done that with `find -newer' and a timestamp in the
base directory, but on my huge tree that was still the dominant time!
(BTW it's not as reliable as you'd think to just trim directories like
that -- many build processes have subdirectories that depend on their
parents, or sibling directories).

No no.
  -  Initial inode state is Modified.
  -  The serial number is
     updated once on transition from Not-Modified to Modified -- this
     only happens when the file is modified and is in the Not-Modified state.
     I.e. normally this never happens.
  -  The Not-Modified->Modified transition causes the parent directory
     to be checked -- if that's marked Not-Modified do the same thing
     there and so on.  Again this does not usually happen, so no
     overhead in the usual case.
  -  Reading the serial number sets the flag to Not-Modified.
So unless you're actively reading the serial number, the file stays in
the Modified state, the number stays the same, and there's no there's no
disk overhead.
This means if you don't read the number too often, it increments only
slowly.

A date would be nicer in some ways but it'd need a high resolution.
64 bits is more than there is available.  OTOH 32 bits are already
available as a serial number.

I think that's a different issue entirely.

Ugh.  My proposal lets you do this efficiently in user space.
