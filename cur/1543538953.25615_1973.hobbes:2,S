I unfortunately emptied my LKML box before getting a chance to reply to
the questioner so I hope that person is subscribed to the list and will
receive this message.
The issue you are dealing with is old. Look in fs/proc/mem.c to see the
conditions necessary for access.
The process must be stopped, among other things. Sorry to reply to this
issue on the list, as I stated before I lost the original questioner's
email address.
Regards,
Scott
