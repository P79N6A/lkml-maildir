FWIW: As far as I understand the linux kernel code (I am no kernel 
developer so please correct me if I am wrong) the PCI dma mapping code is 
abstracted by struct dma_mapping_ops. I.e. there are currently four 
possible implementations for x86_64 (see linux-2.6/arch/x86_64/kernel/)
1. pci-nommu.c : no IOMMU at all (e.g. because you have < 4 GB memory)
   Kernel boot message: "PCI-DMA: Disabling IOMMU."
2. pci-gart.c : (AMD) Hardware-IOMMU.
   Kernel boot message: "PCI-DMA: using GART IOMMU" (this message
   first appeared in 2.6.16)
3. pci-swiotlb.c : Software-IOMMU (used e.g. if there is no hw iommu)
   Kernel boot message: "PCI-DMA: Using software bounce buffering 
   for IO (SWIOTLB)"
4. pci-calgary.c : Calgary HW-IOMMU from IBM; used in pSeries servers. 
   This HW-IOMMU supports dma address mapping with memory proctection,
   etc.
   Kernel boot message: "PCI-DMA: Using Calgary IOMMU" (since 2.6.18!)
What all this means is that you can use "dmesg|grep ^PCI-DMA:" to see 
which implementation your kernel is currently using.
As far as our problem machines are concerned the "PCI-DMA: using GART 
IOMMU" case is broken (data corruption). But both "PCI-DMA: Disabling 
IOMMU" (trigged with mem=2g) and "PCI-DMA: Using software bounce buffering 
for IO (SWIOTLB)" (triggered with iommu=soft) are stable.
BTW: It would be really great if this area of the kernel would get some 
more and better documentation. The information at 
linux-2.6/Documentation/x86_64/boot_options.txt is very terse. I had to 
read the code to get a *rough* idea what all the "iommu=" options 
actually do and how they interact.

BTW: Did someone already open an official bug at 
http://bugzilla.kernel.org
 ?
