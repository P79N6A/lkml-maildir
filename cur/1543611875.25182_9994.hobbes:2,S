   I dont care too much either way, but if this change is here to stay I'll
   let the non intel maintainers know so they can fix up their pci dma
   code.
Ummm, platforms need to support this format even in 2.4.x
If PAGE is not NULL, "address" applies, else the PAGE+OFFSET
pair applies.  We'll kill "address" very soon in 2.5.x, but it
has to stay around for compatibility in 2.4.x
Look at sparc64 and x86 in 2.4.x, they expect and handle it
correctly already.  IA-64 fixed up their stuff recently too.
