    AFAIK, Linux is the *first* OS that started out as a kernel only. All
    of the userland was added.
What you're calling "userland" is practically the whole operating
system--and it happens to be the GNU operating system.  Linux, the
kernel, came last, not first.  The GNU Project began the development
of this system, years before the first line of Linux was written.
