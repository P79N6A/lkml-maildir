Greetings. 
I am a happy software suspend2 user, but with the recent merge of
pmdisk and swsusp1, I thought I would give it a try and see how far
along it's come. 
Using 2.6.8-rc2-mm1 (that has the merged pmdisk/swsusp) I booted
single user and unloaded all modules, then started a hibernate. 
It gets to: 
PM: Attempting to suspend to disk.
and then hangs. Machine has to be hard power cycled. 
Looking at the code the problem appears to be that my laptop is
reporting that it has "S4_bios" support. It doesn't, but swsup1 sees
the S4_bios in /proc/acpi/sleep and tries to call that instead of
swsusp1. 
Is there any way to disable detection of S4_bios?
Is there any way to get swsusp1 to use it's S4 instead of S4_bios?
I guess I can recompile with the calls to S4_bios removed and see how
things go.
