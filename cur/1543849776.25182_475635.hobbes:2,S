We don't use kernels later than 2.6.15 in our shipping releases since 
they have
some issues with stability.

dmesg produces no output since the errors are reflected from init.
Errors are typical of an unmounted volume.  i.e. 
"cannot touch /var/lock/subsys/<service> (dozens of these)
Starting System logger (hangs for 15 minutes) 
So no logs .....

No, I do not believe so.

This is the right question.  I will collect the various versions this 
occurs on and post them here.

Pretty easy to do.
