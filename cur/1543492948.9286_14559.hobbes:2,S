But you don't need capabilities for named at all. Named could be
secured if there's a port-device-map which describes who (uid)
may use which port. Named would get a port, mail another and so
on.
There was a patch for this around (called sockfs). (But
capabilities are a good thing and should be implemented.
Only named doesn't need it.)
