Ouch. Thanks for catching, your patch looks good. Before I add the ack though,
I would like to get more details of the error in case there are other gremlins
I haven't thought of and the fix for memory-hotadd is more complex.
First, can you confirm this is node hot-add please? I'm haven't looked at
the memory hot-add code in a while so I would like to be sure this problem
path only exists on node hot-add. If it is node hot-add, then everything
should be ok. The memory should get added to the same zone as it did in
older kernels.
Even if this is node hot-add, can you confirm that "ordinary" memory hot-add
is working as expected when ZONE_MOVABLE exists please? To test, add a boot
parameter kernelcore=N where N == 80% of memory and hot-add some memory to
an existing node.
I expect that the memory gets added to the same zone as historically but
when ZONE_MOVABLE is set, you'll see a situation where zones are overlapping
after memory hot-add.  i.e. Before memory hot-add, you'd see
DDDDMM
for ZONE_DMA and ZONE_MOVABLE and after hotadd, you'd see something like
DDDDMMDDDD
so /proc/zoneinfo will look unusual.  I'd like to be sure the memory exists
where you expect it to exist and that there are no problems after hot-add. To
test, a simple memory hot-add followed by a dd of a file the size of all
physical memory followed by a delete should do the trick. Also make sure
files like /proc/zoneinfo and /proc/meminfo are ok and particularly that
sysrq+m produces sensible output.
The only in-kernel user that should notice is one that is trying to walk the
whole of memmap and is using page_zone() changing to detect boundaries. The
existing users I am aware of only walk within a MAX_ORDER_NR_PAGES boundary
usually and a memory section boundary at most. Those users will be ok even
if zones overlap.
Thanks a lot.
If other memory-hotadd users are watching, I'd appreciate a test and a report
with a recent -git kernel to confirm you're ok. Is there a way currently
of simulating memory-hotadd so I can try this out? Ages ago, one could boot
with mem= and "add" the remaining memory at run-time.
