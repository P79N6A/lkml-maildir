One of the greatest mistakes in the past which still affects us now was the 
decision to piggy-back ntp_adjtime and ntp_gettime on top of adjtime() and thus 
creating adjtimex(). Only to save a system-call number or two. WE REALLY SHOULD 
GET RID OF THAT going back to Linux 0.something.

...or even more frequent. In my code I tried to scale the tick interpolation as 
well, thus effectively making adjustments even within timer ticks (so far the 
theory...). I was assuming however that ticks and interpolation clocks are derived 
from one single source and would "float" the same way relative to each other.

What is "otherwise"? Outside the "NTP clock model", or "between ticks"?

First you need a new clock model that's compatible with NTP. Then you can consider 
how to implement the NTP stuff. So the clock even without NTP has to be strictly 
monotonic for any interval it is read, be it nanoseconds, microseconds, 
milliseconds, seconds, minutes, hours, days, ... The clock delta (=increase of 
time) over time should be as constant as possible (i.e. time shouldn't go up like 
stairs).

Adjustments to the clock _model_ are asynchronous by definition, while adjustments 
to the clock itself are, well, periodic. Whatever the period.
Maybe this helps and can be agreed on.
