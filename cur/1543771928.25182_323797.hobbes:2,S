Forgive me if I'm being obtuse (again...), but this hunk doesn't look
like it would work well in the 4K stacks case.  When 4K stacks are being
used, dyn_tick->interrupt() will only get called in the nested interrupt
case, when the interrupt stack is already in use.  This change also
pushes the non-assembly __do_IRQ() call out of the else branch, meaning
that, when the switch is made to the interrupt stack (most of the time),
__do_IRQ() will be called twice for the same interrupt.
It looks to me like you want to put your #ifdef chunk *after* the call
to __do_IRQ(), unless you have some reason for needing it to happen
before the regular interrupt handler is invoked.
What am I missing?
