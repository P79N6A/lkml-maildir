Hello,
I made an unsuccessfull search on the m-l archive about this problem, so 
now I'm going to report it in the developing m-l.
I own a Cyrix III processor (400 Mhz up to 800Mhz) on a via chipset 
motherboard. When I boot with a kernel compiled for Cyrix processor or 
with a 686 pentium the lilo gets the images, put it on memory and 
decompress it, but when it has to boot (after the "Loading 
mlinuz..........") it always reboot the computer.
I've found out that the Cyrix III has no CMOV instruction and that this 
could be the problem.
So I compiled a pentium mmx version (after mrproper and dep) and all 
worked fine.
My question is: ok, it can't work if 686 compiled, but why does not it 
work also for the Cyrix III version?
I tried a "vanilla" kernel and some htb pathced one.
kernel versions: 2.4.19 and 2.4.20.
hope my report will help
keep up the good work
feel free to contact me
bye
