It's interesting to look at this backwards:
	Imagine if copy_to_user returned void and delivered a SIGSEGV
	on fault, and always had.
	Now, to fix this, we'd want to add new code paths to the 5,500
	callers throughout the kernel.
I'm pretty sure everyone would balk.  They'd say "sorry, you're going
to have to wrap your syscalls somehow".
But as we all know, it is harder to remove a feature from Linux, than
to get the camel book through the eye of a needle (or something).
Oh well,
Rusty.
