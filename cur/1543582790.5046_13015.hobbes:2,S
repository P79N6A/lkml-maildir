Well - I'm not sure that this is a good idea. When PIDs increase
monotonically, chances are very small that the race condition implicit in
sending any signal to a process results in killing the wrong process (ie, a
new process, but with the same PID) - you'd need to zoom through 32000 PIDs
in a very short time to make this happen.
With truly random PIDs, there is a much larger chance of a new process
sitting on a recently used PID.
What would work is to have cryptographically randomly generated PIDs which
would then guarantee not to return a previously returned number within 32000
tries, and also not be predictable - there must be algoritms out there which
do this.
