if other device overwrite that, it is OK.
even for all pci_dev, pci_device_add will call set_dev_node(&dev->dev, pcibus_to_node(bus));
to overwrite it.
but for netdev under pci_dev, it will get node from pci_dev directly.

original default is -1, and this patch just try to use parent's node as default.
