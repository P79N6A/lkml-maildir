That said, I would like to again point out that using sparse swapfiles 
should still be discouraged.  It may be supported, but it's much better 
for system performance and stability, IMO, if the sysadmin makes certain 
all swapfiles are 100% allocated before they are mentioned to the swap 
subsystem.
