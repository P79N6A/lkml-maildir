Well ... I can guess how it goes:
Manager:   "2.6.x is out, are our patches in it"
Developer: .oO(crap I forgot about this, better get my skates on)
           "No, but they will be in the next kernel"
            .oO(As long as I get them in the current merge window)

OK ... I'd really like that, but I think in order to do that I think we
have to have a tree that represents only everything that's going
upstream.  That would be a -mm but without the patches that aren't going
to be included in the next release.  I suppose we could do this today
simply by making it the sum of all the git trees and nothing else.  The
closer this tree is to what mainline will be next release, the easier it
will be to encourage people to test it.

We could always try it.  Practically the way to do this is to reduce the
merge window down to a single day, but to do that you obviously have to
give us prior notice of a 2.6.<x> release, which might be the
impractical bit ...
