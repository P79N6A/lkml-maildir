  1    23        4
(note: monospace font needed)

Everything is right. The indent only goes from "1" to "2" [see above], 
"3" to "4" is called

err = very_long_function_name(lots_of_arguments,
                              less,
                              less,
                              less,
                              less,
                              even_more_arguments,
                              more_of_this,
                              more_of_that,
                              more,
                              more,
                              more);
IMO, preferred:
err = very_long_function_name(lots_of_arguments, less, less, less, less,
      even_more_arguments, more_of_this, more_of_that, more, more, more);
YMMV.
