The might be issues already fixed in 2.6.15 (he tested the then-current 
2.6.11.7) or there might be powerpc specific problems, but after a quick 
look at this page it looks like a serious page.
He also posted the complete lmbench results, dmesg's and .config's at 
his page, and from a first view I'd say he has very well documented 
what and how he measured.
