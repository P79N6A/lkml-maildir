I am not asking the top level functionality to change.
I am asking for the correct length be passed to
the protocol specific code. The reason *WHY* I want
to do this is
I am writing some code to use the sockets infrastructure.
My current sockaddr structure is a union of several
sub-protocols that I implement in one common code.
The family is the same in all these cases.
Depending on the length passed to me in getpeername,
I fill in the correct members and return it back.

I know that move_addr_to_user handles it, but after all
the processing has been done. The time and space has
been wasted. The code should have just returned in
the first place. I am sorry if that did not come
through in my last email.

This duplication can be removed if the code is cleaned
up. For example in getpeername the code would look
something like
sys_getpeername(int fd, struct sockaddr *s, int *len)
1. copy length from user, check for invalid values,
   if the values are invalid return
2. Look up the socket
3. Store the value of len passed by user.
4. Pass the socket, address and len to protocol specific
   getpeername
5. copyout the sockaddr upto a maximum value of len passed
   by user (compare using the value stored in step 3)
I think this is a cleaner implementation. Again, I say
I think, there might be reasons why the existing code
is better, which I am not aware of. The protocol specific
code need not even look at len if it does not care,
it can put in its own value in the address we pass to
it. We will compare it to the original value.
This in addition to giving me what I want to see
(passing the value to protocol specific code), saves
time and space when the value of length is invalid.
The existing code handles things fine, but the code can be
improved.
Even if we do not pass the value passed by the user
to the protocol specific code, I would like to cleanup
the code in socket.c to check for invalid values
upfront and save time and space in all the calls.
I hope this is clear.
