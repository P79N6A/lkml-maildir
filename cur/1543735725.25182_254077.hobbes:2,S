There were changes in the function that prints the above message,
however they were indentation only. I really doubt it could be the HID
changes I did.
It looks like there is either a problem with ACPI IRQ routing that when
enabling the EHCI controller IRQ does something bad to the OHCI
controllers, or the EHCI driver itself does something bad to the OHCI
controllers. (Afte all, the controllers share their ports.)
Try disabling EHCI in your config to confirm my theory.
