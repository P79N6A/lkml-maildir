Thanks,
I was very skeptical that it would work.  But simply installing the
  2.2.9.uniform-ide-6.19.kilo.patch
was sufficient to correct the problem.  My system boots now regardless
of whether I enable the PIIX option.  Although, I decided to use the
kernel with it enabled, just to see if I actually get a performance
boost out of it.
The only problem I had with the 2.2.9 kernel once adding the 2.2.9.uni...
patch is that 'make menuconfig' didn't list the option to enable mouse
support or the 'mice' submenu.  However, I found the way around the problem
is to instead run 'make config'.  Once mouse support is enabled, it shows
up with 'make menuconfig'.
So now I'm a happy 2.2 kernel user.  And I'm even happier to know that
this patch is generally available, and I didn't have to do any strange
hacks.
