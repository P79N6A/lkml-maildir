I don't think a saving of a few k of text would justify slob's retention.
A reason for retaining slob would be that it has some O(n) memory saving
due to better packing, etc.  Indeed that was the reason for merging it in
the first place.  If slob no longer retains that advantage (wrt slub) then
we no longer need it.
Guys, look at this the other way.  Suppose we only had slub, and someone
came along and said "here's a whole new allocator which saves 4.5k of
text", would we merge it on that basis?  Hell no, it's not worth it.  What
we might do is to get motivated to see if we can make slub less porky under
appropriate config settings.
Let's not get sentimental about these things: in general, if there's any
reasonable way in which we can rid ourselves of any code at all, we should
do so, no?
