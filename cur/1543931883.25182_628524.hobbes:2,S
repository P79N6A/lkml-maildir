My understanding is that the linux starts in real mode, and uses the 
BIOS for such things as reading the very first image.   
arch/x86/boot/main.c seems to use BIOS calls, and one can do what I 
wrote in C or asm.  Good place to measure the appropriate delay timing, 
and pass it on forward.  That's what I was suggesting, which is why I 
copied the ASM routine from my old code listing as I did.
