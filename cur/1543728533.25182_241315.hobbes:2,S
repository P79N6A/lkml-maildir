a.  Yes, it should be more flexible than just 'overtemp'.
b.  For userspace, there are:
acpid -  
http://sourceforge.net/projects/acpid/
acpi tools, like ospmd (by Andy Grover) - in CVS at
  
http://sourceforge.net/projects/acpi/
What others are there?
And ospmd (at least) needs some care.  Andy wanted to give it up
1 or 2 years ago, so I took it over for awhile.  However, it
still needs more care, so if anyone out there wants to maintain it,
please speak up.
