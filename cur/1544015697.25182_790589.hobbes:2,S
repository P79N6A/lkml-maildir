Subject: [PATCH 1/6] checkpatch: handle missing #if open in context
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2009/1/12/157

If the #if opening statement is not in the context then the context
stack can be empty.  Handle this by ensuring there is always a blank
entry in the stack.
