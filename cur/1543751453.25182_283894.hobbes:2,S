Its the ideal solution. The diff for this is available on your computer
already - its kept in /dev/null 8)
          The PC-Technologies RZ1000 IDE chip is used on many common 486
and
          Pentium motherboards, usually along with the "Neptune"
chipset.
          Unfortunately, it has a rather nasty design flaw that can
cause
          severe data corruption under many conditions. Say Y here to
include
          code which automatically detects and corrects the problem
under
          Linux. This may slow disk throughput by a few percent, but at
least
          things will operate 100% reliably.
          The CMD-Technologies CMD640 IDE chip is used on many common
486 and

or
          "SiS" chipset. Unfortunately, it has a number of rather nasty

common
          conditions. Say Y here to include code which tries to
automatically
          detect and correct the problems under Linux. This option also
          enables access to the secondary IDE ports in some CMD640 based
          systems.
