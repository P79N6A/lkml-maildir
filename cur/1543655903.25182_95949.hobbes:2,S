	Well, I said earlier that it was a generic Pcmcia problem,
because I have the same problem with the orinoco driver. But, we need
to separate the noise from the problem (Andrew says that the timer
is only a harmless warning).
	I personally never liked the release timer, and I personally
avoided it in the wavelan_cs driver for a long time (before David
forced me to it). But, anyway at some point this will need to be
investigated.
	Have fun..
