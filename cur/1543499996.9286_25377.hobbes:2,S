I had a similar problem on a box.  How did you figure out where init was
failing?  In my case, the kernel would lock up on the initial open of
/dev/console in init/main.c, right before init was called.  My latest
2.2.10 works, though.  I think I may have deleted some blank lines from
main.c, which may have affected how the machine code was arranged, but
haven't had the nerve to re-test it yet.  I was thinking that maybe a
half a bit was bad in memory or cache or something.  Never *could* get a
straight answer as to what might have been wrong.  Guess it'll remain a
mystery.
