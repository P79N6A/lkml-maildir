Hi
On a similar topic..
Do we have the infrastucture to log 2.2 bugfixes, so that they don't get
lost if not immediately ported to 2.3?
2.0/2.1 had the unsatisfactory situation of relying on people's memory
and/or code inspection. That is a classic way to lose important bugfixes.
I'll bet there are some 2.0 fixes not in 2.2, as we speak..
Chris
