No.
It's not the same VM.  2.2 had a VM change from Andrea at about 2.2.17-18,
don't know about before...

2.4.0-2.4.10pre10 = Rik's VM.
2.4.10pre11+ = Andrea's VM
2.4.12-ac has Rik's vm, and it looks like Alan will keep Rik's VM for a while.

I think this is still out of date...  There's a patch at Rik's site.  Don't
know if it is accurate for Andrea's VM...

True.  I don't know if Andrea is working on that yet...  It looks like he's
trying to iron out his new VM...
