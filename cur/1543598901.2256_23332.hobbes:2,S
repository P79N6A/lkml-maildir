Well, the flames finally died down and everyone forgot about it again

Where'd you get 1.5x from? :)  But, go ahead and re-write the CML2 engine
in C.  There's been some work done on this.  A few people (Al Viro?) even
said that if this got into 2.5 they'd do a 'C' version.  Many many months
ago, if i recall correctly.

It shouldn't be a consideration at all.  I'd go as far as to say any sort of
speed bonus on a 486 is gravy.  In other words, how fast something will be
on 10 year old hardware shouldn't be important (I'm speaking of 386 with
10 years.)
