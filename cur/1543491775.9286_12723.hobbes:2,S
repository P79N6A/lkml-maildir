In fact, BLKRRPART could be improved: currently you get EBUSY if some
partitions of the disk are used. But if the partitions which are busy have
not changed at all (and kept the same number), then I think there is no
reason not to succeed. It will require some additional code (checking if the
busy partitions have the same start/length in kernel tables and in the new
partition table), but IMHO is worth doing that.
