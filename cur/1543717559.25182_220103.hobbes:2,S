If gcc really optimizes that to just the identity function, then surely
that's a gcc bug?  Multiplication is left-associative, so i * 1000 /
1000 = (i * 1000) / 1000, but (i * 1000) should be zero for any i
divisible by i^(sizeof(int) - 12).
It shouldn't be able to optimize out the 1000 here for exactly the same
reason it shouldn't be able to optimize out the shifts in, e.g.,
	i << 12 >> 12
