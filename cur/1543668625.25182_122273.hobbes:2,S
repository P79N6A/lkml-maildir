Mmm, i have not been into fbdev much lately, but for my X devel work, i
believe thta it is a good thing to separate the framebuffer issues from
the output issues, and thus, for the card i have at least, have one
function where the per chip things are done (memory detection, bypass
unit handling, framebuffer and memory management) and another set of
functions which would be head, that is output, specific. This way, you
would configure the /dev/fbx and when the user which to use this or that
output, the DDC will be connected to the output, not the framebuffer.
This seems a reasonable way of doing this and should solve your problem,
no ?
