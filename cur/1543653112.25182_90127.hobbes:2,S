i suspect the idea would be to always make every process a proper pthread
object as well. (but Ulrich will correct me if this is not the case.) This
means that across fork() we can set up the TID pointer via CLONE_SETTID,
and after exec() we need the new set_tid_address() syscall to initialize
it.

if CLONE_VM is set then the TID is set immediately, before sys_clone()  
returns. Or are you worried about the fork() case?

this would be fine to me, but i wanted to get away with a single pointer.

we do not want to do yet another syscall. Also, this makes the TID value
nonatomic - debugging code would have to know whether the child has
already executed the syscall.
