Try it. It doesn't force it to be built in.

static int __init wait_scan_init(void)
{
    scsi_complete_async_scans();
    return 0;
}
Could that not be built-in to SCSI as a sysfs attribute, rather than using 
a module to tell the kernel to do something? It looks like someone might 
want to call scsi_complete_async_scans() more than once too - if they also 
don't allow modules to be unloaded then they can't.
