Hm Ok. That's explainable. You don't have CONFIG_IA32_EMULATION set
and arch_setup_additional pages is only defined/exported in
syscall32.c which won't be built in your case. (It should go away if
you set CONFIG_IA32_EMULATION).
Andi - Is arch_setup_additional_pages required for x86_64 without
IA32? If so what should it call (like it calls syscall32_setup_pages
in IA32 case)? If it is not needed I guess we can make it a no-op in
case IA32_EMULATION=n?
linux/interp.h -
#ifdef CONFIG_X86_64 && !defined CONFIG_IA32_EMULATION
static inline int arch_setup_additional_pages(struct linux_binprm *bprm,
                                int executable_stack)
{
        return 0;
}
Perhaps we  need an arch-specific override for interp.h?
