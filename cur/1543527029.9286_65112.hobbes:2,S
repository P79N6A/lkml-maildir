Andrea,
(and Stephen Tweedie, I appreciate your help earlier)
I've noticed that 2.3.X does NOT export the internal calls needed to
load NWFS as a driver -- I must now compile it within the kernel.  I am
using Caldera's latest 2.3, so I am wondering if this is the case for
all the distributions, or just theirs.  Here's a list of unresolved
externs.  I can, of course, build an ugly patch to do this if any
variables/functions have been declared "static" -- looks like we may
have to put out our own linux distribution if going the driver route is
not always going to be supported in stock kernels (???).  
Alan Cox was correct, file system performance on 2.2/2.3 IS MUCH BETTER
than 2.0 and earlier.  I am looking at the page cache at present for 2.3
-- a very impressive piece of work -- not at all dissimiliar to the
Cache Manager in Windows 2000 (though the page cache in Linux is a MUCH
easier implementation to work with -- no structured exceptions or unwind
cases to deal with).
If 2.3 is no longer exporting the attached APIs, then you guys may have
just added another company to the penguin hatchery (TRG) because we will
need to provide our own Linux version (with lots of patches) for each
kernel build to support NWFS and M2FS (our clustered file system for
Linux) for 2.3 and above.  
I hope I am missing something here on the public APIs and this is just a
Caldera problem.  I am heading up there this afternoon to find out
what's up with their 2.3/2.4 stuff, and why 2.2 file system drivers are
no longer loadable under 2.3/2.4.  
Jeff
