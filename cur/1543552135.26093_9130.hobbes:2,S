Indeed. Further curiosity is sometimes promptly slaked in a manner
such as this...
:; cLIeNUX0 /dev/tty4  17:43:31   /
:;cc1
main(){
int i;
i = 1 , 2;
printf("%d\n",i);
}
:; cLIeNUX0 /dev/tty4  17:43:31   /
:;
The output of cc1 is not shown in the above. You'll have to
play that little ode to the joy of empiricism yourself.
