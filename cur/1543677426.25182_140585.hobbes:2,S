Yes, with elevator=deadline the many fsx tests failed on 2.5.70-mm5.

Ok, the deadline test was run for 10 hours then I stopped it (for the
elevator=as test).  
But the test on elevator=as (2.5.70-mm9 kernel) still failed, same
problem.  Some fsx tests are sleeping on io_schedule().  
Next I think I will re-run test on elevator=deadline for 24 hours, to
make sure the problem is really gone there.  After that maybe try a
different Qlogic Driver, currently I am using the driver from Qlogic
company(QLA2XXX V8).
Thanks,
