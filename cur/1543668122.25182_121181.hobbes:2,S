Agreed. We have a cluster which is writing on average something like
20 Megs/sec/node. We had to lower the write threshold from 30% to 0%,
because with the constant writing, linux will buffer it for 30 secs,
fill up RAM, try to empty the write-cache, stall, wash, rinse,
repeat. Because it was being filled up at roughly the rate it was
being emptied, once it got 30% behind, there was no catching up, so
the realtime system would lose data. Ouch.

Last time I checked, cron had 1 minute resolution.

Exactly. 
Helge's comment about /tmp files and rewriting files multiple times:
in real life, how often does this happen? How often do you overwrite
one file many times in 30 seconds? The occasional 20 kilobyte /tmp
file perhaps, but I doubt it matters in real life. In real life, when
writing to disk constantly (not just scientific applications - I
believe this happens in the real world too!), waiting for 30 seconds
is a liability!
