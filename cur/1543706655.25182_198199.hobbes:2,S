That algorithm is the /definition/ of UTF-8, not just an example. Sure you can actually 
do it another way, but the result is uniquely defined (or else it's not UTF-8).

Sounds like you think we want to invent a new problem. The problem is
here and it's real (not in the U.S, but the the rest of the world). There are 
Network file systems (samba in particular), partitions belonging to other 
OS's (ntfs, fat or even other Linux installation on the same machine), 
removable devices etc etc.
Microsoft introduced a kludge for managing long file names in a short filename 
context. Since Linux doesn't have the length limit a nicer kludge could be used
to represent unicode as non-unicode in userspace like a Uxxxxx. When there is
a mismatch there has to be kludge, but it's still many times better than a bunch
of character that look like garbage (and cause legacy application so choke).
