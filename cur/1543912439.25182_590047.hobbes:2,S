that's exactly the problem... it replaces my mapping with the new one... i.e. 
it first deletes my mapping and then creates the new one at the same 
location.
i *guess* this all happens in exec.c, lines 1033ff:
munmap_back:
	vma = find_vma_prepare(mm, addr, &prev, &rb_link, &rb_parent);
	if (vma && vma->vm_start < addr + len) {
		if (do_munmap(mm, addr, len))
			return -ENOMEM;
		goto munmap_back;
	}
