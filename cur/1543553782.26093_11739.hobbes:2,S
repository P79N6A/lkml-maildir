Great.  Thanks again.  Trond has this patch now for ongoing
NFS locking stuff.  Hopefully 2.4 will now work OK with "legacy"
Apache configurations.
As long as the "new style" Apache configurations work OK.

I sense a corrupted struct timer_list!
Your kernel was traversing the tvecs[] array and took a fault.
The fault handler called printk() which called the console code
which called mod_timer() which deadlocked on timerlist_lock.
The NMI handler broke the deadlock and called the console code.
The NMI handler also deadlocked on timerlist_lock.
If this theory is correct the below patch should remove the
deadlock and thus allow you to get the usual diagnostics.
But I suspect the diagnostics will just show a trace up
into cascade_timers() or run_timer_list() which doesn't
tell us much.
If that is the case I'm afraid you will have to identify the
_exact_ statement where the error occured,  put some diagnostic
code just prior to it and run the tests a second time.
The interesting piece of information will be the timer's
function pointer.  So you'll need to add something like:
	struct timer_list *some_timer;	/* The timer which causes the fault */
	...
	if (some_timer->list.next == 0 || some_timer->list.prev == 0)
		printk("Corrupted timer! function=0x%p\n", some_timer->function);
	/* The next statement is where the oops occurs */
	<some statement which uses *some_timer>
Then if you can look the function pointer up in System.map or gdb
we will have our culprit.
