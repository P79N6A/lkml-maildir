Of course it will be ``yes'', it's just the next natural step for
an ever maturing (great!) OS. ``Ordering'' is implicitly preserved
in the buffer cache (read/write (2)), but DB/Journalled FS would
want a finer access to the device (imagination use req'd here).
And there's plenty of (old) research there on queuing models
which would provide that kind of flexibility for that future time
when there'd be ``oui'' :-).

Oh, c'mon James. You know we all appreciate you very much, no need for this.
The reason some of us have not started meddling with SCSI core is that
same appreciation of the other ppl working on it, the trust and good rapport.
Linux SCSI is one of the great environments, cf. <you know where'd I refer>.
I'm happy and proud to be part of this environment.
Probably what Justin meant is some past events in the history of Linux,
and the best course of action would be a LaTeX/PS/ASCII presentation/layout/blurb
of what Justin had in mind, and we can start from there.
