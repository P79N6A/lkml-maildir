Playing devils advocate, with this, the process flow is:
- kernel sees a new device
- kernel sends hotplug event for bus with slot, address, vendor id, etc.
- userspace loads a module based on that info
  <some sort of synchronization here waiting for driver to initialize>
- userspace echos to sysfs to bind device
- kernel sends hotplug device event
- userspace creates device node, then continues with device
This looks:
a) inefficient
b) an awful lot like the PCMCIA model. Which... eww.
