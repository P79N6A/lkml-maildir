The design of staircase would make renicing normal interactive things
- -ve values bad for the latency of other nice 0 tasks s is not
recommended for X or games etc. Initial scheduling latency is very
dependent on nice value in staircase. If you set a cpu hog to nice -5 it
will hurt audio at nice 0 and so on. Nicing latency unimportant things
with +ve values is more useful with this design. If you run X and
evolution at the same nice value they will get equal cpu share for
example so moving windows means redrawing evolution and X moving get
equal cpu. Nicing evolution +ve will make X smoother compared to
evolution redrawing and so on...
