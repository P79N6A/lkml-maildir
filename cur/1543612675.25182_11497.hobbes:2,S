As the person who started this thread, I'll say that I'm willing to
test new alternatives, Redhat engineers gave me a newer kernel to see
if it helped (it didn't) and if someone can give me (or point me to) a
glibc with better io I'm glad.
Right now I have to explain to my boss why my $4K pentium computers do
io faster than my $20K itanium computer. And since our major software
code is 3rd party, we can't rewrite the appilcation.
