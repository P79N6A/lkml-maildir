On a serial console, I'm issues a command like 'exec ls'
Autologin
[root@cas8]# exec ls /
bin   dbin  dev

Autologin
[root@cas8]# 
I'm not getting all output before a new getty is spawned by init. Now
I'll execute 'exec strace ls /'
old_mmap(NULL, 4096, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS,
-1, 0) = 0x402b1000
mprotect(0x401b2000, 733184, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE) = 0
mprotect(0x401b2000, 733184, PROT_READ|PROT_EXEC) = 0
mprote

Autologin
[root@cas8]# 
Again I get part of the strace but then it is cut off.  I do not have a
problem when streaming data, just when using exec. I am running my own
init with mgetty and my own login.  So maybe my tty is not setup
correctly.  Is there something I forgot to do?
Thanks,
Chris
