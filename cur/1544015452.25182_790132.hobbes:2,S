It also doesn't make sense to make three changes adding different
interfaces and rearranging the same section of code three different
times. I'm dropping the patch, please send me a merged version of those
patches with a commit message you're happy with. If you want Acked-by
lines, we'll have to wait for them on the new patch as I'm going to do
this exactly by the book regardless of time pressures now. Please
indicate who you want Ack-ed by lines from so I know who to wait for.
Also, you'd better exclude the suspend/resume change and credit me for
the bitfield change, just to be 100% sure this is all legally accurate.

Richard
