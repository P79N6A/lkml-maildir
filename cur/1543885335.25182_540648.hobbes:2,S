Hi all,
	I know writing decent Kconfig help entries is an obscure art, but can
we please try harder to make the help, y'know, helpful?  See below for
my experience with 2.6.21-mm1.
	How come the Kconfig help for EXTERNAL_POWER says "is mandatory for
battery class support" and I still get prompted for "Battery class
support" when I say N?
	How come both these entries are of form "Foo (FOO)? -- Say Y here to
enable foo."?   Shouldn't we assume the reader knows what Y means?
How about:
        Battery class support (BATTERY) [N/m/y/?] (NEW) ?     
        This allows battery monitoring by userspace via sysfs (if
        available) and/or APM kernel interface (if selected below).  Say
        Y or M if building a kernel for a laptop.
I don't even understand the CONFIG_EXTERNAL_POWER enough to comment on
that one 8(
Rusty.

External power kernel interface (EXTERNAL_POWER) [N/m/y/?] (NEW) ?
Say Y here to enable kernel external power detection interface,
like AC or USB. Information also will exported to userspace via
/sys/class/external_power/ directory.
This interface is mandatory for battery class support.
