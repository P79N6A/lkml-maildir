USB_CLASS_COM is surely ok. The descriptors may be a relict from the
time where the CDC equivalents where not in the driver... 
The problem is that, as it is now, it works. The whole RNDIS stuff is
extremely time intensive to debug: when you have one odd value in some
place, Windows just says "Error 10" and you have to guess what you did
wrong. No further information available. So the best way to be
successful may be to check it in as it is, maybe add some FIXMEs, and
let the masses test the code. Then cleanup the remaining issues step by
step and wait until nobody crys any more :-)

Well, there is no other interrupt endpoint on the PXA, and it somehow
works :-)

It was hard enough :-)

Ok. We have tried to make the design as minimal-invasive as possible...
