For what I can understand from the spec, they have came up with
some kind of a bytecode much more powerfull than a simple scatter/gather
list. Hey, you can even store such "procedures" in a ROM on the board,
and execute them no matter which processor or OS you use, something
much similar to IEEE 1275's FCode.
