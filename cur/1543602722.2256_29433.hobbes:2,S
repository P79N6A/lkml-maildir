I have installed Linux (Slackware 8.0) on a Abit Pt5 with last bios.
The kernel with that distribution is 2.4.5 and I'm trying to compile kernel 
2.4.9 downloaded from kernel.org
I already compiled that kernel on my notebook and it works fine, but 
everytime I reboot my p133 (the one with the abit) it freeze.
It load the kernel and uncompress it and then... nothing!
I tried to make a light kernel and a big kernel but... nothing.
What can I do?
