Hi,
I'm sorry to insist, but I really want to understand what occurs in this 
portion of kernel code. And that's why I resend my previous message with the 
hope that someone could enlighten my mind.
Thanks in advance,
	Eric

The task_struct is also updated in sys_arch_prctl (ARCH_SET_FS and 
ARCH_SET_GS), so not just on a context switch.
How the task structure could be out of date wrt thread.gs and thread.fs?
What could be a typical scenario that could induced gs or fs to be modified and 
not thread.gs and thread.fs?
Why we have a difference between ARCH_GET_GS :

and ARCH_GET_FS :

If I follow what you say, why can't we have the same optimization in 
ARCH_GET_FS?
thanks,
