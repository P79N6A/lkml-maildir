Are you sure?  IOW, are you seeing a leak of the count?  The sigqueue
structure has a lifetime the same as the timer, IIRC.  So each time the
signal is sent/received there's no accounting, because it's reused.
But timer create/delete does sigqueue_alloc -> __sigqueue_alloc which
does the inc. and sigqueue_free -> __sigqueue_free which does the dec.
I'm fairly sure I had tested this.
thanks,
