I'm a little confused about the on-disk format
is it SCCS and the problem is that CSSC doesn't recognise everything that
the latest SCCS does so a patch is needed for CSSC or does it differ
slightly from SCCS?
Larry has mentioned that there were things they changed from the base SCCS
format that they started with, but he indicated that they had fed patches
to SCCS to use the new info.
I'm trying to figure out if the problem is CSSC not being as compatible as
it would like to be or is larry not getting the changes he is proposing
into SCCS, or are there other problems.
