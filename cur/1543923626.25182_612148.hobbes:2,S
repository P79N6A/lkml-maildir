Yes, that's the normal mode of operation. The hypervisor will timeslice
multiple vcpus onto a single vcpu.
This patch doesn't relate to that; it's whether a Xen Linux guest's
kernel can be preempted to reschedule processes while running under Xen.
The normal xen-unstable or vendor Xen kernels don't support this, but
the mainline kernel with paravirt_ops/xen support does.
