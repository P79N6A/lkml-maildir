I wish, its that easy to say :)
Historically (2.4 and earlier), buffer_head is the primary structure for
doing IO. We also used it as the interface between VFS, helper functions
and filesystem-specific code to pass physical disk block# information.
We also used them to link buffers/pages/data to JBD transactions to
provide ordering guarantees (for various journal modes).
Now (2.6), we no longer use buffer_head as a primary IO descriptor, 
but we still use it for other reasons. In general, buffer_heads are 
evil - eats up low mem, lots of them floating around, bigger code path,
bigger memory foot print, causes TLB/SLB misses, causes fragmentation
etc..
"nobh" option tries to attaching buffer_head to pages to cache disk
block mapping information. Where ever its needed, it uses temporary
(on stack) buffer_head to pass it to lower-level filesystem-specific
code and uses the disk block# mapping info from it - to create bios.
(BTW, since its also used for transaction ordering - we can't support
"nobh" option for all journaling modes).
Now, "zero impact to user ?" - don't know for sure. Since buffer_head
nicely cache disk block mapping information - we save on calls to
filesystem->get_block() when we need this. With "nobh" option, 
we need to do this every time. Especially on filesystems with 
blocksize < pagesize (1k, 2k) - we may need to multiple calls to 
->get_block() to get all the disk block#s for a single page (4k). 
These calls,  *in theory* could end up doing a disk read. All the
benefits of not having buffer_heads may be worth taking this 
overhead ?  Don't know for sure - thats why this is an "option" 
for now :(
Clear as mud ? :)
Thanks,
Badari
