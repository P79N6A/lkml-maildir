Yeah, I know but ieee1394 with 400Mbps is fast enough for my laptop and 
honestly I doubt that either one, be it USB2.0 or ieee1394, can really 
sustain this high transfer rate for a reasonable amount of time. And for 
most applications it is simply not needed. Maybe if you do TCP/IP over 
those technologies. But YMMV and I accept that. For me it was the 
cheapest alternative (450 bucks) to buying another harddisk for my laptop.

Please read the first 150 lines of [1]. If you want USB2.0 (wrapped) 
devices support you need to check out [2]. It's a 'glue' with the SCSI 
subsystem, but Greg KH can tell you much more about it.
[1] ../linux/drivers/ieee1394/sbp2.c
[2] ../linux/drivers/usb/storage/*, specially transport.c
