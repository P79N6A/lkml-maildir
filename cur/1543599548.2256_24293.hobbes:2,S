It's also a class A misdameanor to buy tobacco is you are under a certain
age, which is a serious penalty.  A copy of penthouse is a felony in this 
state, depending on the circumstances.  You are allowed to have multiple
wives, and the State will support all of them for you with child support
so long as they are older than 16.  If you are a Mormon, you get to tell 
these wives they will not be allowed in heaven unless they do whatever
you tell them.  
I'm not mormon, I am an American Indian.  I also run the Utah Native 
American Church (www.utah-nac.org) in addition to all the other businesses
and projects I am involved in.  I have not eaten peyote for over 20 
years, FYI, but there are Indians in my church who do.  I just do simple 
stuff like prayer pipe with sacred tobacco.   Please don't clump me into
the Mormon polygamist groupies.  I do have several polygamous families 
living on my street, however, and they seem nice.  
Each wife gets her own house, and the husband visits each one.  You have
to be very rich to be able to practice polygamy in this State, BTW.
