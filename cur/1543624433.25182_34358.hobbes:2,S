I believe changes to NCR53c80 were recently reverted back because
these "fixes" lead to massive data corruption.  It is preferable
that the driver remains unbuildable, and therefore doesn't cause
data corruption than to be buildable and case data corruption.
Alan has always advocated taking the 2.4 driver as an important
first step in fixing it for 2.5 - this provides a sound base for the
2.5 fixes to be built upon.  Not doing this just makes whoevers job
to really fix the driver harder.
Hint: kernel programming is not about getting things to build.  It's
about making this work properly.
