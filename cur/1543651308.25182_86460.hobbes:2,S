You would want a dump2disk that could span devices.
Probably a module that would put a header on each part with
a dumpID and sequence#.  Compression would also help here as
well.  The right compression would actually accelerate the
process.
Early userspace would locate and assemble the pieces and put
the dump somewhere.  This might happen between mounting /
and assembling the other mirrors.  That would be up to you.
