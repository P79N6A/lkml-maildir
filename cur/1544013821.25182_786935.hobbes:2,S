would be cool to do it - i think sparc32 is one of the last major physical 
architectures to not be on genirq - if we did this conversion we could do 
a good number of nice cleanups by eliminating all the genirq/non-genirq 
differences.

oops, indeed. I fixed it, added your Tested-by and pushed it into 
tip/irq/urgent. Thanks Sam!
