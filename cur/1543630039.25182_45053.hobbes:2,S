Show me where the 'physical' address is actually treated as a physical address.
You can't, because it isn't.  The 'physical' address is merely a zero-based
logical address, and the code *relies* on it being contiguous.
Your code is going to do __pa there, and you are going to go walking into places
you don't expect.  Even you need my logical address space abstraction, or else you
want to go making global changes to the common kernel code that just add cruft.
I enjoy the feeling of removing cruft, even when it's an uphill battle.
