Right.  It's possible that your BIOS may be letting the kernel write.  While
I don't write the kernel, it's probably best for Linus to answer this one,
but it's possible that the kernel is making a BIOS call, and the BIOS does
not refuse to write data (which it should just say "no IDE drives are on the
system right now") with the IDE setting to <NONE> in your BIOS.  OTOH, the
kernel may be making calls of it's own or as you say, there may be a broken
driver.  I seem to remember there was a "bug workaround" option in the
kernel for the CMD640 chipset.

Then AFAIK, it's definitely a BIOS issue. There might be (if not there
already) a kernel option to check to see what the BIOS setting is for number
of IDE drives (of course set to <NONE> would mean 0 drives), and refuse to
write it.  This workaround (if any) would be required for buggy BIOSes (I'm
sure yours isn't the only one <grin>).
