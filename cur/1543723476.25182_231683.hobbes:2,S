Ah, I see.. I missed the call to vio_register_device_node in
probe_bus_pseries...
Ok, so if we add call to kobject_get in kset_find_obj we can just add
kobject_put right in vio_find_name because there can be only one-to-one
match between a slot and a vio device and we don't need refcounting there,
right?
