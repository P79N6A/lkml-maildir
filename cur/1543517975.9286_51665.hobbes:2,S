To make effective use of inlining you need information that is at the same
level as sourcecode.
so either you go for something even more suboptimal than the (current
only) behaviour of gcc, or you deliver source (in some format).

FAIK they require access to the source in some form to work, e.g. similar
to a c++ template repository.
