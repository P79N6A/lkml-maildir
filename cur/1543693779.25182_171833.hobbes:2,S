I covered this some time ago in the remap_file_pages threads with Wil.
remap_file_pages requires pte modifications and tlb flushes.
O_DIRECT only walk the pagetables, no pte mangling, no tlb flushes, the
TLB is preserved fully.
thinking only 64bit in the above of course, 32bit is different but still
mmap+remap_file_pages can't beat O_DIRECT if you dedicate your machine
for the database task.

no way, it has the disavantages I mentioned above, it would be a bad
idea to use remap_file_pages on any 64bit system out there.
we know remap_file_pages has a chance to improve the /dev/shm mappings
from 32bit systems, but that has nothing to do with the long run 64bit
machines, remap_file_pages is mostly a 32bit hack for ia32 with PAE.
About the in-memory databases, that's really the big iron
non-mass-market, not the other way around. only the big irons have
enough money to buy that much ram, you sure can't compare the price of
the ram with the price of disk, or at least not yet in this market AFIK.
