Hi All,
Testing time again :-)
I have put patches against 2.2.24pre3 and 2.3.25 on the APM web
site (
http://linuxcare.com.au/apm/
).  I have compiled both of
these, but have run neither :-)
Let me know ...
Changes:
	Merge 2.2 and 2.3 drivers.
	Remove APM dependencies in arch/i386/kernel/process.c
	Remove APM dependencies in drivers/char/sysrq.c
	Reset time across standby.
	Allow more inititialisation on SMP.
	Remove CONFIG_APM_POWER_OFF and make it boot time
	configurable (default on).
	Make debug only a boot time parameter (remove APM_DEBUG).
	Try to blank all devices on any error.
Cheers,
Stephen
