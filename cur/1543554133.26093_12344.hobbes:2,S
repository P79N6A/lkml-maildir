Agreed.  Default is /var/lib/modules-persist.  People who have a
separate /var partition that is mounted after modules are loaded can
use / and specify
persist /lib/modules/persist
in /etc/modules.conf.  If you have a separate /var and you do not want
to write to /, change your initialization scripts to load modules after
mounting /var.
