	Hi Dave,
	As promised, here are the IrDA patches that are good to go in
the kernel. The last one is the IrCOMM fix that you say you wanted in
your kernel. The sir-dev fixes are also critical to finish the work on
SIR dongle drivers. I've kept a few more less tested patches for later.
        Patches tested on 2.6.0, please push to Linus...
        Thanks...
        Jean
