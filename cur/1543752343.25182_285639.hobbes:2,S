Dear kernel hackers,
I am to use RT Linux and it used kernel patch that requires kernel.org 
version of the kernel and APM and ACPI to be switched Off. But I am to 
Power Off my ATX machine when program finiseh, so I does not used RT 
Linux, yet. Can you recommend me how to do so, and hoe to do so 
correctly,please?
adding kernel parameters viac lilo as append="apm power-off" just 
switches power form HDD, but not form the ATX board (Via Apollo KT800 
ans Athlon XP 2200 Thoroghbred). It prints just Power down and doest not 
"switch off" power. I was found in source this text but it was followed 
by call never declared funcion machine_power_down and it seems to be 
BIOS function.
Can anyone help me?
Thank  you for any help
Yours faithfully
Peter Fodrek
P.S. Slackware 9.0 is my distribution
