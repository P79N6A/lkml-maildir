And for those reading along at home, _surely_ you understand the
meanings of "ambiguities in an offer of contract must be construed
against the offeror", "'derivative work' and 'license' are terms of
art in copyright law", and "not a valid limitation of scope".  If not,
I highly recommend to you that master of exposition who goes by "Op.
Cit.".
Cheers,
