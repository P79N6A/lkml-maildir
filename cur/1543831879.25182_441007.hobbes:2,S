Hi,
Correct me if I am wrong :
I was wondering if we are hiding the real bug here. All the pages 
allocated should have the zone set properly. Also, we would not be 
playing with invalid pages, since the pages allocated through 
kmem_getpages() should be contiguous. Also, I did a check in 
kmem_getpages() to see if the zone is set for the pages, properly.. 
surprisingly it was not set for the last page in the allocation!
Thanks,
