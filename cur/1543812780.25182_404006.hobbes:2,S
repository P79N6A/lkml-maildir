It depends on where performance growth is stopped.
From the first glance it does not look like find_extend_vma(),
probably follow_page() fault and thus __handle_mm_fault().
I can not say actually, but if it is true and performance growth is
stopped due to increased number of faults and it's processing, 
your approach will hit this problem too, doesn't it?
