Not any more ;-)

I'm using the senddmail milter library that does the socket communication. So any 
bad things should be searched there.
I tend to think that the same program when being compiled as a 32-bit executable 
does not cause these segfaults on a 64 bit kernel.
I also tried to use ksymoops to get a disassembly of the corresponding kernel 
code, but the result did not look good to me.
Is there a deeper reason why the kernel does not provide more info (like a call 
trace) on segfaults?
Will an strace of the program (multi-threaded, unfortunately, just as slapd (most 
likely)) be helpful?
When I tried it for slapd, the (rest of the) strace was:
9931  socket(PF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, IPPROTO_IP) = 3
9931  connect(3, {sa_family=AF_INET, sin_port=htons(427), sin_addr=inet_addr("12
7.0.0.1")}, 16) = 0
9931  setsockopt(3, SOL_SOCKET, SO_RCVLOWAT, [18], 4) = 0
9931  setsockopt(3, SOL_SOCKET, SO_SNDLOWAT, [18], 4) = -1 ENOPROTOOPT (Protocol
 not available)
9931  mmap(NULL, 1434435584, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1
, 0) = 0x2aaaaae32000
9931  --- SIGSEGV (Segmentation fault) @ 0 (0) ---
