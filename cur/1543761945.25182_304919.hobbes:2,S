Ok, I have some patches to lifebook that I would like to included (if
they work):
1. lifebook-dmi-x86-only - do not compile in DMI detection on anything
   but x86.
2. lifebook-cleanup - do not set rate/resolution nor enable the device
   in lifebook initialization routines, let psmouse code do it for us.
3. lifebook-init - rearrange initialization code to be more like other
   protocols to ease dynamic protocol switching.
4. psmouse-proto-attr - expose protocol as a sysfs attribute and allow
   changing it from userspace.
Please give it a try and let me know if it does/does not work.
Thanks!
