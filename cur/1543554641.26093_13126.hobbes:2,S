Hi Petr,
You probably noticed this already but I just wanted to bring it to your
attention that /usr/bin/vmware-config.pl script needs updating since the
flags in /proc/cpuinfo is now called "features" so it otherwise fails
complaining that my 2xP6 has no tsc. Trivial change but still worthy of
propagating into your latest .tar.gz file for 2.4.x
Regards,
Tigran
