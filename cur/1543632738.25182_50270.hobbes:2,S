<patch snipped>
I have tested this patch out.  It fixes the issues that I raised in my 
note on 1 May, with the exception of the non-blocking 
case, which Steven has acknowledged separately to me that he is 
still working on.  Some of the changes fix bad breakages,
and the patch doesn't seem to introduce any new problems,
so I'd certeinly vote for its application.
Cheers
Michael
