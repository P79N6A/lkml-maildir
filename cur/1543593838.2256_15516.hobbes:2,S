I just don't understand what would give anybody the right to stuff any
random junk into the official kernel "because it would be convenient for
us", not respecting the view on the matter of the people who wrote it and
so own the copyright to it in the end. If said "right" isn't granted, you
go ahead and accuse them of being "comunists" wanting to take away your
stuff as theirs when it is *exactly* the other way around...
The licence on the kernel certainly gives you (or anybody else) the right
to fork the kernel and make a "protocols are modules" version. Wish you
luck getting it to be used by somebody else, and getting the help of the
people in the know on fixing it when it breaks.
