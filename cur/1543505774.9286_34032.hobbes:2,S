Hi!
I noticed that the new 'kupdate' is giving my hard drive
a lot of I/O. Do I have to disable 'mobile-update' and can I
configure 'kupdate' to be as laptop friendly as mobile-update is?
Where is documentation about kupdate (or which source file contains
the source)? The disk I/O started after upgrading from 2.2.10 to
2.2.11.
Thanks a lot,
Peter.
