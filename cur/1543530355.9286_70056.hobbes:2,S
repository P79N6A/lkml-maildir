Hi everyone,
    I want to ask about USB in the recent 2.3 kernel.  In the 2.3.24 kernel,
I could use my usb devices without a problem, but now, with the newer
versions, I cannot, I dont know why, hence this email.
    I have read the /usr/src/linux/Documentation/devices.txt file and
determined that the device I want to use is my mouse.  Which is down in that
file as
Node = /dev/usb/mouse0
Type = char
Major = 180
Minor = 16
    So, I rebooted my machine with the new kernel, my new kernel (2.3.51)
detects my usb mouse, says something about mousedev0 and input0 (what does
that mean BTW ?) and then prompts me to login.
    Previously, with eariler kernels, the /dev/usbmouse0 node would have
automatically appeared for me, which I thought was great, but now, I have to
create it myself it seems.  So
mkdir /dev/usb ; mknod /dev/usb/mouse0 c 180 16
that should create the mouse node in the /dev/usb directory.  With the so
called correct information.  But it doesnt work, when I had the
/dev/usbmouse0 node I could "cat /dev/usbmouse0" and get garbage when I
moved the mouse, it's a very basic way of detecting whether the mouse exists
or not.  But with the new kernel, I can create the device no probs, but
then, when I try to cat it, I get "device does not exist" or something
similar.
What has happened ? can anyone tell me where I am going wrong ?
Also.  What has happened to PPP ?? for some reason, my modem is detected,
it's interrupt and ioport are quite nicely detected, but no tty is created
or linked in for this device ? why not ? shouldnt the isapnp detect my modem
and attach it to the appropiate /dev/ttyS(X) device for me ?
Can anyone tell me about these problems ?  I am not that sure about how to
fix them and well, I am lost without you all helping me :) thanks
