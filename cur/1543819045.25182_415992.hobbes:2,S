Ahhh, but you're missing the whole point of the GPL.  The GPL is
not really a normal license, it's a copyright license.  Basically,
copyright law doesn't allow you to do *anything* with someone elses
work without permission.  The GPL grants you such rights.
However, in exchange for this, you agree to follow the license when
redistributing your software that you built against the GPL:ed
software.
So, in essence, *if* you choose to redistribute your work, you must
abide by the GPL.  And the GPL tells you to GPL your work too, if it
falls within the scope that the GPL defines.  It thus have nothing
to do with whether the programs are a mechanical combination of
two original works or not.  The only point where this comes in is
where the GPL defines its scope.
Thus, if the GPL said that all programs distributed on the same CD
as a GPL:ed program needs to be licensed under the GPL, and you
redistribute your software on that CD, you must license your software
under the GPL, unless you want to be in violation with the license.
Again, I'm not a lawyer...
