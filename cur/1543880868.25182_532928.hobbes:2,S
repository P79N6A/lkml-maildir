	I ran the above code on both sides (on ttyMI0 of the server with
the MOXA card, and on ttyS0 of the server with the serial console).
I then logged in to the remote server using "cu -l ttyMI0 -s 38400",
and ran "find / -print" to generate some traffic. It went on without problems
for few minutes. But as soon as I pressed <enter> to the cu(1) (generating
traffic in the opposite direction), I was disconnected from the remote shell,
and the new mgetty has been started. The above program has reported
DCD change to 0 on both sides (in one direction it can be explained
by the fact that mgetty cycles DTR on startup, generating a DCD cycle
on the remote end of the null-modem connection).
