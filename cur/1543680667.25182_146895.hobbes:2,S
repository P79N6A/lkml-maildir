That didn't complain but pings to the ext gw were broken. Noticed the
route contained:
3ffe:8001:c:ffff::36/127 via :: dev sit1  proto kernel  metric 256  mtu 1480 adv
mss 1420
And having remembered /127 being mentioned as bad I changed the
interface config to a netmask of /64. Dropped it and brought it
up and it all works.
There's something fundamental about ipv6 netmasks that I just don't
understand...
