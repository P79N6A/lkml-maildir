OK, I think I know why this one didn't work.
If the bit_mask is 0, find_first_bit() returns 32 or BITS_PER_LONG.
That works fine as long as NR_CPUS is 32, but when it isn't things
are broken.
    (find_first_bit(rcu_ctrlblk.rcu_cpu_mask, NR_CPUS) != BITS_PER_LONG)) {
		return;
should probably work here.
I guess we need to audit all bitmask tests and fix them to check for
the right value. 
Thanks
