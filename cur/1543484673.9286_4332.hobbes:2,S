	Hello, I have an obsession about having the whole dmesg of the
current kernel in a file... ok that worked in 2.0.36 collecting it with
the mouse mark/paste by scrolling back + the continuation ... NOW with
linux 2.2.x with frame buffer console enabled (matrox g200) I can't
capture my whole dmesg :(((
How can I capture it, still?
