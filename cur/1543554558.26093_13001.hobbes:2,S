What safety problems bdflush/kupdated have? (if something they lacks in
performance since they works on a global dirty list while it should be per
queue dirty list to take the I/O pipeline full on all disks)

This is provided in linux for ages by LVM+reiserfs also in 2.2.x.
Any filesystem with inode map and not dependent on disk offsets to find
stuff (exept the superblock of course) can do the grow almost trivially
and online, the shrink is some more complicated instead.
