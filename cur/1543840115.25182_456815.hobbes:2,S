On the local file system, everything is fine. UIDs and GIDs are the same on client and server, so that cannot be the problem. Client and server run Gentoo Linux with kernel 2.6.16 on the server and 2.6.17 on the client.

16, and it is a limitation of the RPC protocol's AUTH_UNIX/AUTH_SYS
authentication scheme, rather than being specific to NFS.
Note that if you use KerberosV based authentication at your workplace,
then you can migrate your NFS setup to the stronger RPCSEC_GSS/krb5
authentication. That also happens to fix the 16 groups limit problem.
