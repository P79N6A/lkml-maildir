In fact, that's the 2.5 plan -- send link up/down notifications via
netlink.  If you provide a patch, more the better.
For 2.4, you'll need to poll ETHTOOL_GLINK, assuming that the driver
supports ethtool.
In any case, your tulip patch looks pretty good on first review.  I'll
likely apply it to 2.4 and 2.5 after testing and further review.
