Yes sure. Note that this is documented:
	/*
	 * Kill off a pending schedule_delayed_work().  Note that the work callback
	 * function may still be running on return from cancel_delayed_work().  Run
	 * flush_workqueue() or cancel_work_sync() to wait on it.
	 */
This comment is not very precise though. If the work doesn't re-arm itself,
we need cancel_work_sync() only if cancel_delayed_work() returns 0.
So there is no difference with the proposed change. Except, return value == 0
means:
	currently (del_timer_sync): callback may still be running or scheduled
	with del_timer: may still be running, or scheduled, or will be scheduled
	right now.
However, this is the same from the caller POV.

Yes, exactly. The patch is trivial, but I need some time to write the
understandable changelog...

Yes, I think this should be OK. schedule_delayed_work() will notice
_PENDING and abort, so the last "x->work()" doesn't happen.
What can happen is
					<timer expires>
	cancel_delayed_work(x) == 0
					-->delayed_work_timer_fn(x)
					__queue_work(x)
					<keventd scheduled>
					x->work()
	schedule_delayed_work(x,0)
	<the work is scheduled again>
, so we can have an "unneeded schedule", but this is very unlikely.
