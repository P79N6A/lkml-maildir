depends, usually either one process has pid==1 (the init)
or no process should use that pid (still handled special)
nevertheless, the latter case requires a 'fake' pid==1
to make some userspace processes happy (e.g. pstree)
> - Should pid == 1 ignore signals, it doesn't have a handler for?
the 'init' process must be protected in a similar fashion
than the real init is, otherwise guests will end up dying
in certain situations, of course, it would be nice to have
some kind of flag to turn this on and off

agan that's a feature which would be nice, especially
for the lightweight contexts, which do not have an init
process running inside the guest

this is mandatory, as it is required to kill any process
from the host (admin) context, without entering the pid
space (which would lead to all kind of security issues)
> - Should the pids in a pid space be visible from the outside?
yes, while not strictly required, folks really like to
view the overall system state. this can be done with the
help of special tools, but again it should be done
without entering each guest pid space ...

definitely, we (Linux-VServer) added this some time ago
and it helps to maintain/restart a guest.
> - Is a completely disjoin pid space acceptable to anyone?
yes, as long as the beforementioned access, management
and control mechanisms are in place ...

doesn't really matter, but I see three options there:
 - the parent space
 - the child space
 - both

that would be a requirement for hierarchical spaces

yes, definitely, but it could happen via some special
interfaces, i.e. no need to make it compatible
> - Should we be able to have processes enter a pid space?
definitely, without that, the entire VPS concept will
not work, folks use the 'admin' backdoors 90% of the
time ...

ptrace: no not really, if there are issues which want
  to be investigated, you can always enter the space and
  attach the strace there. IMHO there is not much info
  in ptracing the space creation/transition
kill: yes, once you identified an evil guest process,
  you want to get rid of it, without entering the space
> - After migration what identifiers should the tasks have?
doesn't matter, as long as they are unique, so
 ppid1/ppid2/ppid3/pid would work ...
