Maybe that's because you redefined "rc" to mean "ridiculous count"?
People would rather test a release candidate than a ridiculous count. ;)

Am I the only person here who doesn't see it as "either/or"? ISTM that
"odd/even" and the "2.4 approach" are orthogonal issues.
What about something like the following? (It probably needs tweaks but
it might be worth considering.)
2.6.odd-alpha1: Equivalent to 2.6.x-rc1.
...
2.6.odd-alphaA: Equivalent to 2.6.x-rcA. (A is a constant. Linus gets to
                set it, perhaps before relesing alpha1. Perhaps A=1 or
                A=2 could be tried for the 2.6.13 cycle. Setting it to
                an arbitrary value should free Linus's brain for other
                matters.)
2.6.odd-beta1:  Equivalent to 2.6.x-rc(A+1).
...
2.6.odd-betaX:  Equivalent to the last 2.6.x-rc in the current scheme.
2.6.odd-rc1:    Equivalent to 2.6.x *RELEASE* now.
...
2.6.odd:        *Identical* to last 2.6.odd-rc. Not a single patch of
                difference, except for the version number! If you
                committed anything since 2.6.odd-rcX, then either (a)
                you need to make a 2.6.odd-rc(X+1), or (b) you committed
                something that should have waited for the next 2.6.odd.
2.6.even-beta1: Skipping -alpha because we're only going for bugfixes
                in even, right? (*Please* listen to davej and don't
                treat drivers differently than core code. If you must
                include major driver updates, then don't skip -alpha.)
...
2.6.even-rc1:   This is when you think you're completely done with
                2.6.even and you think it's time to upload the final
                release.
...
2.6.even:       This is the last 2.6.even-rc, with no changes. (Same -rc
                rules as for 2.6.odd-rc.)
(...cycle repeats...)
For an approximation of the so-called "2.4 approach", let A=0 and
s/beta/pre/g. Perhaps the alpha/beta distinction won't *really* mean
anything, but it might have a subliminal effect on everyone. :) Anyway,
if the alpha/beta distinction is overengineering, it's easily removed
(see the beginning of this paragraph).
Whether with alpha/beta or just plain pre, this seems more robust to me
than the other suggestions so far.
