I've seen similar behavior on the same cards, but it only seems to affect
100Mbps operation, plugging it into a 10Mbps hub instead of our 3Com
100Mbps switch will also get things working as does running ifup/ifdown on
the interface.
The tulip driver recognizes it as a "Lite-On 82c168 PNIC rev 32".
I've noticed this behavior for a few kernel revisions now, up to and
including 2.2.17.  It would be nice to get this bug worked out before
2.2.18.
