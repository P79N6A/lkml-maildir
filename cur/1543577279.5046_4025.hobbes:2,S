So tell us, why do you run your raid5 devices in degraded mode??  I
cannot be good for performance, and certainly isn't good for
redundancy!!!  But I'm not complaining as you found a bug...

Yep.  This, combined with a related bug report from  n0ymv@callsign.net
strongly suggests the following patch.
Writes to the failed drive are never completing, so you eventually
run out of stripes in the stripe cache and you block waiting for a
stripe to become free.  
Please test this and confirm that it works.
