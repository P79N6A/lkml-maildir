Not really. As I mentioned before, It is reproducible in qemu, but
happens a bit earlier:

   sched: improve preempt debugging
   This patch helped me out with a problem I recently had....
   Basically, when the kernel lock is held, then preempt_count
underflow does not
   get detected until it is released which may be a long time (and arbitrarily,
   eg at different points it may be rescheduled). If the bkl is released at
   schedule, the resulting output is actually fairly cryptic...
   With any other lock that elevates preempt_count, it is illegal to schedule
   under it (which would get found pretty quickly). bkl allows scheduling with
   preempt_count elevated, which makes underflows hard to debug.

so at least a dumb bisection won't do here.
.config attached for those who were not on cc last time I sent it.
