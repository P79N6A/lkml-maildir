Yes, but wait till you find yourself stuck on a weird embedded board
with a small flash and a serial console and you are trying to debug the
PCI device you've built.
Sure in most cases you have lspci (and its friends); but why do people
want to deprecate a perfectly good tool that occasionally comes in
useful? (Make it a compile time option sure, remove it - no).
