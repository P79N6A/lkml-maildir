1) quite a lot of Linux users do use Oracle, DB2 or do
    scientific calculations - distributions cannot afford
    to break those applications, the default has to work
    for everybody
2) "weaker" randomization (2MB) is still effective if the
    stack is non-executable, so the "load a bunch of NOPs"
    approach won't work - this is what Fedora and RHEL use
3) it is not as theoretically strong as what you propose,
    but having the "weaker" scheme enabled is definitely
    more secure than having the "stronger" scheme disabled
    because it breaks applications
