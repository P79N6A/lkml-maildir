A number of allegations were clearly wrong. Some posters have even 
admitted or even criticized these factually incorrect accusations. 
Instead of wasting more time/energy arguing or litigating, we hope that 
this debate will now end peacefully and have helped to clarify and 
resolve problems.

It is extremely ironic that the free software community who was so 
strongly opposed to the DMCA and considering it so evil now invokes it 
in such a far fetched manner (Alan Cox was probably cynical about this 
but you don't seem to be). It is also far from clear whether tainting 
and the MODULE_LICENSE() macro are a "technological measure that 
effectively protects" anything.
Again, our workaround is purely cosmetic, its side-effect on tainting 
totally unintentional, we are sorry that it has caused so much concern 
and we will be fixing it in good faith (even if it is a broken 
concept), while hoping that the underlying problems will be correctly 
resolved in future kernels/modutils.

We did not mislead people. Our license terms are clear and openly 
stated in many places.
You could perhaps argue that we "mislead" a string comparison to fix a 
usability problem, but this kind of technique is very common today, 
especially under Linux where numerous interfaces are simulated. Would 
you pretend that things like Wine are wrong and misleading when making 
windows software believe that it runs under the real thing?
