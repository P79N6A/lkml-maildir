My part in the rant (really somebody else's rant...) is that if kernel
threads can be made to out-perform current implementations of M:N
threading, then all that has really been proven is that current M:N
practices are not fully optimal. 1:1 in an N:N system is just one face
of M:N in an N:N system. A fully functional M:N system _may choose_ to
allow M to equal N.
Worst possibly cases that I expect to see from people experimenting
with this stuff and having a 1:1 system that out-performs commonly
available M:N systems: 1) The M:N people innovate, potentially using
the new technology made available from the 1:1 people, making a
_better_ M:N system 2) The 1:1 system is better, and people use it.
As long as they all use a POSIX, or other standard interface, there
isn't a problem.
If the changes to the kernel made by the 1:1 people are bad, they will
be stopped by Linus and many other people, probably including
yourself... :-)
In any case, I see the 1:1 vs. M:N as a distraction from the *actual*
enhancements being designed, which seem to be, support for cheaper
kernel threads, something that benefits both parties.
