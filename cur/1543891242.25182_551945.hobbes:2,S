Socketed CPU?
It *might* be an idea to reseat it, maybe it's simply insufficient seating
of the CPU due to rougher travel handling than with a desktop.
(CPU socket issues can easily be the case on some notebooks AFAIK,
and it was on mine: Inspiron 8000 - bought it as completely dead until I simply
fiddled with CPU socket...).
