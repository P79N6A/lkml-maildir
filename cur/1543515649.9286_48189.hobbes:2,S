This is my problem almost exactly. 
I also am using Linux professionally for industrial use.
We also am doing some MAJOR LINUX introduction work with some 
high officials in Eastern Europe.
We hope see some mass movements to LINUX next year.
They are fed up with Windows and want to look at Linux
This StarOffice mixup  is a bit of a shame at the moment.
A neat solution would be nice ..
