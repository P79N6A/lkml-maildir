yep, in this thread I've been mistakenly using the term UCS-16 when I
should have said UTF-16 (ie. the variable length, 2 byte encoding).
Samba currently treats the bytes on the wire from windows as UCS-2 (a
2 byte fixed width encoding), whereas perhaps it should be treating
them as UTF-16. I should write a smbtorture test to detect the
difference and see what different versions of windows actually use.
luckily the new charset handling stuff in samba3 and samba4 will make
this easy to fix :-)
