Wow, thanks Alexy!  i think this works.  Didn't work one time, 
locked my box one time, and worked one time, but that's all 
probably because i was doing a lot of insmod/rmmod'ing of 
various tulip modules as i fiddled with the 2.3.47pre8 tulip.c 
patch.  
Got as far as removing all the tulip_open(), tulip_up(), 
tulip_down() patches, basically everything except for the
outl_CSR6() and flags stuff, and that worked.  Then got your
mail and added the udelay() into a plain 2.3.47pre8 tulip.c, 
and got the above fail/lock result.
Rebooted the box, it worked.  Patched udelay() into the 2.3.50 
tulip/ tree, and that works as well.  i made the udelay(2) 
a udelay(4) just in case; figured tulip_up() doesn't get 
called often anyway.
