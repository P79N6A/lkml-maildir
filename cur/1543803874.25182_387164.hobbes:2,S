Subject: [patch] bug fix in dio handling write error
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

There is a bug in direct-io on propagating write error up to the
higher I/O layer.  When performing an async ODIRECT write to a
block device, if a device error occurred (like media error or disk
is pulled), the error code is only propagated from device driver
to the DIO layer.  The error code stops at finished_one_bio(). The
aysnc write, however, is supposedly have a corresponding AIO event
with appropriate return code (in this case -EIO).  Application
which waits on the async write event, will hang forever since such
AIO event is lost forever (if such app did not use the timeout
option in io_getevents call. Regardless, an AIO event is lost).
The problem is that calls to aio_complete() is conditioned upon
READ, but it should've handle WRITE error as well.
