 True, but people do make mistakes from time to time. :)  If I had a
choice between a piece of silicon and a piece of documentation to trust, I

 Obviously this specific case has turned out to be an issue with Qemu, so
it is somewhat irrelevant and given how the opcodes were added to the
architecture I would consider the emulator excused.
