Hi,
I was used to debug my kernel code with the remote serial console
facility on the 2.4.x serie, but I really can't figure how does it works
to activate it on the 2.6.0-test9 that I just got.
I took a look at the relevant HOWTO:
http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Remote-Serial-Console-HOWTO/kernelcompile-25.html
But, it seems that all the configure scheme has changed for the 2.6.x...
Can anybody give me some pointers on a documentation or give me some
hints ???
Regards
