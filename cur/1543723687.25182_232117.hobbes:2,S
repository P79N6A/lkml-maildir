I forwarded this and the main patch to Andrew, for some testing -mm. 
Then push it upstream.
The main thing you did not address of Herbert's comments was the macro 
naming, AFAICS.  I don't have a big preference.  If asked, my style 
preference for this driver would be
ICH_R8
ICH_R16
ICH_R32
ICH_W8
ICH_W16
ICH_W32
Short, and bit-size-explicit.
I've always been annoyed that the API function 'readl' represented 32 
bits :)
