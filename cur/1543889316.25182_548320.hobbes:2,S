The 31 bit limit for some of these cards is a problem, we currently only
do __GFP_DMA for bounce buffer sg elements allocated for user supplied
references in ioctls.
I figure we should be using pci_alloc_consistent calls for these
allocations to more accurately acquire memory within the 31 bit limit if
necessary, we could switch to these to remove the need for the __GFP_DMA
flag in the aacraid driver?

I'll defer to Mark on this one.  However, please remember that you can't
just blindly remove GFP_DMA ... there are some cards which require it.
Aacraid is one example ... it has a set of cards that can only DMA to 31
bits.  For them, the GFP_DMA is necessary:  The allocation in question
is a scatterlist, which must be within the device DMA mask.
