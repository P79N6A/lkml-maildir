Whee.  A busticated feature - how annoying.
Do you happen to know the exact PR# for that one?  Looking at the gcc RPM
changelog, there's a *lot* of backported fixes in the Fedora compiler, so it
may in fact be in there already.  I'm mentioning this mostly as a practical
"increase the number of testers" - as far as I can tell, what will ship in
Fedora Core 6 is going to call itself gcc 4.1.1, and I'm pretty sure I'm not
the only person who isn't ambitious enough to build a whole new gcc just to
test this.  So a lot of people won't be able to easily use this until FC7.
Having said that, I have *no* idea how best to code "gcc 4.2 or patched Fedora
4.1.1"...
