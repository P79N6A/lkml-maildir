Unless you loaded the extra ECC modules Linux really has no awareness of the
ECC at all. More likely and the one I would check first is that the mtrr
ranges are right and the BIOS set up the memory correctly. It could be
continuous ecc faults (eg if the kernel puts something critical in an iffy
spot in the DIMM and NT didnt) but that sounds dubious.
