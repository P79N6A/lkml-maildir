Andrew,
	Do you intend to apply Olaf's patchsets to eliminate linux/version.h?
Some of them will not apply, because, at -mm2, KERNEL_VERSION isn't used
anymore.
	Maybe I can generate a patchset for V4L eliminating version.h, if you
want, against latest version.
Mauro.

The following series of patches removes almost all inclusions
of linux/version.h. The 3 #defines are unused in most of the touched files.
A few drivers use the simple KERNEL_VERSION(a,b,c) macro, which is
unfortunatly
in linux/version.h. This define moved to linux/utsname.h
There are also lots of #ifdef for long obsolete kernels, this will go as
well.
quilt vi `find * -type f -name "*.[ch]"|xargs grep -El
'(UTS_RELEASE|LINUX_VERSION_CODE|KERNEL_VERSION|linux/version.h)'|grep
-Ev '(/(boot|coda|drm)/|~$)'`
search pattern:
/UTS_RELEASE|LINUX_VERSION_CODE|KERNEL_VERSION|linux/(utsname|version).h
PS: I hope my script is working ok.
