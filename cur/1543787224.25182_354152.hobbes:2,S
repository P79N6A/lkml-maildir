How about exposing modules' id tables through sysfs and allowing a way 
for entries to be marked valid or invalid?  Then a userspace utility 
program could easily set things up so that normal USB storage devices are 
accepted by usb-storage and not ub, or the other way around.
The part that Pete tackled, arranging the preferences when the modules 
_aren't_ loaded, is actually the harder part.
