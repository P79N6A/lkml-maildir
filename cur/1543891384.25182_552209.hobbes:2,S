It would be nice. I can accept it without his ack, but it would be
better to have it, if possible.

Seems ok to me.

As you wish.

Are those a code, or just another internal driver configuration (for
example, maybe some register initialization inside the sensors)? We
should take care to avoid adding material here that can be later
complained.

Maybe you can do this then just for the bigger tables.

Your driver have about 3600 lines. We target to keep newer files with a
maximum of about 1000 lines on the same file (unfortunately, some
drivers are bigger than that), separating the driver into logical
pieces. I think it would be interesting to split it into two or tree
files.

There are some rvmalloc on cpia, cpia2, em28xx, ... 
What the current drivers are doing is to replace it to vmalloc_32:
#if LINUX_VERSION_CODE < KERNEL_VERSION(2,6,15)
                if ((buff = rvmalloc(dev->num_frames * imagesize))) {
#else
                if ((buff = vmalloc_32(dev->num_frames * imagesize))) {
#endif

You're welcome.
