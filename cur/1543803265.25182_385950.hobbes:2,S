I think so. If needed one can delete and create.

IMHO: unnecessary complicates things.

If the control messages go through the main (WiPHY) driver it can
decide and/or forward the request further, to the library.
Not sure about netlink. OTOH I'm at all not sure netlink should be
used for configuration. sysfs, ioctl seem a better options. Netlink
is better for state monitoring etc. I don't know it very well though.

Are they any global config settings?
sysctl or sysfs maybe?

If you mean "settings for a particular physical card" then WiPHY.

If "local" means "concerning the wlan device" then sure, yes.

I don't think so. The hardware driver should get the request first,
the rest should look like a library.
I've played with both approaches for years and I would avoid
"802.11 using the hw driver" scenario if at all possible.
