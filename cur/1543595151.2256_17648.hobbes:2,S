It would be great to see the "Shared Source" licenses that Microsoft has 
made people sign.  It would be especially interesting to compare the
agreements that were given to the various classes of licensees:
University Research Departments, ISVs, Enterprises and so on.
Then we'd be able to have a somewhat more balanced public discussion
of that includes the problems with Microsoft's licenses.
Perhaps some of you work or study at institutions or companies
that have copies of some iterations of the Microsoft licenses.
If so, perhaps you could post them on the web and send the URLs.
