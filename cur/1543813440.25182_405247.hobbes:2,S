Thank you for your comment.
I'm very glad. :-)

Ok. I'll check and fix it.

      IA64.
      At least, Fujitsu is making this style hot-add feature
      on ia64 box which is named as PrimeQuest.
      (SGI or HP might wait it.)

      I heard from Andi-san that x86-64 will need this.
      And ppc64 might use some of my patch.
      It depends on ....
         - There is Numa box on its architecture.
         - One node of NUMA will be hot-added.

    If my understanding is correct, there is 2 critical point.
      - One is zonelist update, indeed. Stop_machine_run() can
        cover it.
      - Another is node_online_map and NODE_DATA().
        If node_online_map is onlined before that 
        NODE_DATA() is updated, or before that pgdat is initialized,
        kernel might touch uninitialized pgdat.
        So, node_set_online() is called at final point. 
    
    The old kernel had pgdat->next link list, it was also critial point
    for hot-add. But current -mm remove it. So, it is not issue now. :-)
Thanks.
