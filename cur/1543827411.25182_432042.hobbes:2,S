The hptiop firmware works as the latter case. Should it be modified
like this:
  host->can_queue = le32_to_cpu(iop_config.max_requests);
- host->cmd_per_lun = le32_to_cpu(iop_config.max_requests);
+ host->cmd_per_lun = host->can_queue - 2;
While the 3ware driver sets both can_queue and cmd_per_lun to 254:
(3w-9xxx.h)
#define TW_Q_LENGTH           256
#define TW_MAX_CMDS_PER_LUN   254
(3w-9xxx.c)
.can_queue   = TW_Q_LENGTH-2,
.cmd_per_lun = TW_MAX_CMDS_PER_LUN
Should can_queue be set to TW_Q_LENGTH ?
