Hi,
Am porting the Linux kernel to a new architecture (the 370 instruction set).
I noticed that the timer interrupt does very little.  The question is this:
how does scheduling work if/when there are no other interrupts occuring?
e.g. have two numeric processes running, neither is making system calls,
neither is swapping. etc.
The esa/390's are mainframes; there are no serial ports, no video or video interrupts,
no regular i/o or bus interrupts; nothing else is ticking in any sort of
quasi-periodic manner.  What should I do, make the timer interrupt do a schedule
every ten ticks or something?
