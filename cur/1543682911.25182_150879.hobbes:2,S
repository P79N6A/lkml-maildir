hi,
i have been looking for the possibility to display the contents of several 
directories in another one, but have so far not found anything suitable.
the two possibilites i considered so far were:
- soft-linking all files one by one, but then changes in a linked file 
(renaming, moving, deleting, ...) won't be noticed by the soft-links.
- LVM: exactly what i want as functionality but too low-level. i don't need 
any device merging, striping, mirroring, but just want to be able to link 
directory-contents.
i think it shouldn't be so hard to implement something similar to 
softlinks in ext2 that allows directories to have something like an 
include-directive to display contents of other directories as well.
hope this ain't too naive :-))
