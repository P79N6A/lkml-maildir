Linus, yesterday I was sugesting Hanna to use most of the existing code
and to make :
int sys_epoll_create(int maxfds);
to actually return an fd. Basically during this function call the code
allocates a file*, initialize it, allocates a free fd, maps the file* to
the fd, creates the vma* for the shared events area between the kernel and
user space, maps allocated kernel pages to the vma*, install the vma* and
returns the fd. In this way we can avoid the sys_epoll_close() and close()
can be used. Also the task cleanup comes for free being linked to a file*.
In this way also users that are using /dev/epoll in the old way can
continue to use it, being the skeleton code the same.
Do I have to guess that you do not like this idea ?
