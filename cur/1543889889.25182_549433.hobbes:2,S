Why does checking these errors cause ipw2200 to fail?
> Andrew, can you drop this from your tree?
Would prefer that we debug things first.  It could be that ipw2200 is
trying to create symlinks which already exist.  This might indicate a
programming error in ipw2200, which is what the patch is *for*.  If it
is indeed an ipw2200 bug then the lesson is that we should have been checking
for errors on day one - that way, we'd never have shipped a buggy ipw2200 driver.
I have an ipw2200 - I'll see if I can reproduce this and I'll add some
debugging code in there.  Probably that debugging code should become
permanent.

Things might be already broken?
