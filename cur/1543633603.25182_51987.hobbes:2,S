The system runs very stable with only one (Western Digital) hard disk on ide bus 0, but when I add a second (IBM) hard disk configured as slave, the kernel freezes when I'm accessing the second disk (after *some accesses, i.e. when I can copy 10 small files on it, it freezes on the third). I read the mailing list, lost of people seem to have problems with this configuration, but most advices are to change the cable, which I did.

I see these symptoms only when I make the awful mistake to use the
nvidia drivers.
if I ditch them, all goes fine..
