If rename() is going to overwrite an existing directory it should check
that it's empty and (obvious race prevention) nobody else uses it.
Current code does shrink_dcache_parent() on the victim and then checks
d_count. It is not enough, since we are leaving the victim hashed and
anybody can grab it while we are checking emptiness and start to mess
with it.
Proposed fix: instead of
	if (new_dentry->d_count>1)
		shrink_dcache_parent(new_dentry);
	if (new_dentry->d_count>1)
		fail with -EBUSY
	check emptiness
	...
	...
	...
	d_move(old_dentry,new_dentry);
do
	if (d_invalidate(new_dentry)<0)
		fail with -EBUSY
	need_rehash=1;
	check emptiness
	...
	...
	...
	if (need_rehash)
		d_rehash(new_dentry);
	d_move(old_dentry,new_dentry);
	That is, try to unhash the victim, say EBUSY if failed, remember to
rehash it before d_move(), do emptiness check (we are safe now), do the
rest of rename, rehash the victim if needed and do d_move().
	This should be done for affs, ext2, minix, sysvfs, ufs and coda.
vfat already does exactly that. So there... It's about 6-7 changed lines
in each fs. I'm attaching the patch against 2.2.2-pre2. Apply if you think
that it's suitable for 2.2.early. Race is real, so...
