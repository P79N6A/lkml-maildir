First you need to find out whether a drive has indeed failed, or if you were
seeing spurious controller/driver problems.
Try reading from each drive,  eg.  cat  /dev/...  > /dev/null.   If you can
read all drives completely, they're probably fine.   If one has failed, mark
down which one.  If two or more drives did in fact fail, well then RAID-5 can't
save you.
If no drives failed:  run mkraid -f    -  it will claim that it's about to
destroy all data, but don't worry, it will only re-write the superblocks and
rebuidl the parity.   But this requires that your /etc/raidtab is 100%
consistent with your actual array configration.
If one drive failed:  change the raidtab configuration so that the failed drive
is configured as a failed-disk instead of a raid-disk.  Then run mkraid -f  as
before.
Good luck  !     :)
