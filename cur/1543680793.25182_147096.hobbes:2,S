This is the request_queue_t kobj field not being intialized by 
drivers/block/ll_rw_blk.c blk_init_queue() bug. Either blk_init_queue() 
needs to be fixed to initialize the new q->kobj field (my 
recommendation) or the memset() hack to nbd needs to be merged in. 
Please CC me at least on any further correspondence regarding this so I 
have a better chance of catching these emails. Thanks.
