Um, normally this is actually a hideous netscape/proxy interaction with
FTP URLs.
1: Proxies must decide whether to return things fetched with FTP as
   (usually) text/plain or application/octet-stream, because FTP is
   untyped data. If they return text/plain things like READMEs and such
   are happily considered viewable by browsers and people are happy.
   But then if something's downloaded the normal text->local-OS
   conversion takes place, and that eats binaries if you're not using
   UNIX. But if you mark things as application/octet-stream instead of
   text then lots of browsers (like netscape) automatically start a
   download dialogue instead of viewing thing, which is a pain if
   you wanted to look at a README. The proxy can't win.
   I imagine getting the browser to "prefer" application/octet-stream
   when you ask to download and to "prefer" text/* when you just
   follow a link would permit the proxy which does the actual FTP
   fetch to use the content-negotiation stuff to set a type.
2: Netscape, helpful little bastard that it is, uncompresses as it fetches
   and saves the uncompressed data. There are two things wrong with this:
   firstly, I might not have had enough space for the uncompressed version
   and secondly, netscape stupidly forgets to strip the .gz (or whatever)
   extension, leaving the download directory riddled with .gz files
   which are actually tars and so forth. Hideous.

See if the behaviour persists if you use an HTTP URL instead of an FTP URL
(kernel.org supports both, no?)

If anyone disagrees with anything I say, I am quite prepared not only
to retract it, but also to deny under oath that I ever said it.
