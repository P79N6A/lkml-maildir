Not that I'm the Offical Input Developer(tm) but I'm currently doing 
modifications to the PS/2 mouse support which will hopefully restore full 
functionality for most mice. I'm still coding it and I estimate a day or two 
until I get it working tested patch which I will then send here.
Once question though: I'm currently coding against 2.6.5 - should I do the 
patch against something else?

This wasn't directed to me, but right now I'm focusing on normal mice. I need 
to steal the laptop away from wife to test a Synaptic touchpad....
