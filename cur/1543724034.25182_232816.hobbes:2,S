Hello,
I have exactly the same laptop as Antille and exactly the same problem.
I did some stuff to diagnose it. I have the output of oprofile, my startup messages with ACPI debug messages enabled, and the messages when the lid is closed for about 2 seconds.
The debug configuration is: all components, and level VERBOSITY1.
They're all available here:
  
http://www.math.princeton.edu/~aspirido/gpe-bug/
Watch out -- the two debug logs, uncompressed, are  pretty big (~20mb).
Here's the DSDT for the laptop:
http://acpi.sourceforge.net/dsdt/tables/Dell/Inspiron_2650/Dell-Inspiron_2650-A05-original.asl.gz
I know next to nothing about ACPI, but I hope I can help debug it, if it hasn't been fixed.
Otherwise, I'd like to help test the patch.
Best,
Alexey
