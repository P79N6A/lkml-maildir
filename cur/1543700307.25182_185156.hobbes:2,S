Hi,
I've got a longstanding regression in gnomemeeting usage when switching
between 2.4 and 2.6 kernels.
Phenomenon: 
Without load gnomemeeting VOIP connections are fine. As soon as some
load like a kernel compile is put on the laptop the gnomemeeting audio
stream is cut to pieces and gets unintelligible . On 2.4.2x I don't get
even the slightest distortion in the audio stream under load. I played
around with different nice levels with no success. The problem persisted
during the whole 2.6.0-test series no matter whether I used -mm kernels
or pristine Linus kernels. Even when nicing the kernel compile to +19
the distortions start right away. I tried Nick Piggin's scheduler which
fared slightly better after changing the nice level of gnomemeeting to
-10 but it's still a far cry from the 2.4.2x feeling without any
fiddling with nice values.
Any hints where to start looking are greatly appreciated.

What's the railroad to me ?
I never go to see
Where it ends.
It fills a few hollows,
And makes banks for the swallows, 
It sets the sand a-blowing,
And the blackberries a-growing.
