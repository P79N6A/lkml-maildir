David,
Russel King complained that you might be calling pci_consistent_free
from an interrupt, which is unsafe on ARM. Why don't you remove this
part from pci_pool_free():
+       else if (!is_page_busy (pool->blocks_per_page, page->bitmap))
+               pool_free_page (pool, page);
In that case, fully free pages will stick about until the whole
pool is destroyed, which I think is not a big deal.
