Is it possible for me to use the ide-scsi driver on my cdwriter
drive, while using the standard ATAPI cdrom driver on another
CDROM drive?
I'm using the 2.0.36 kernel.  I know that it can be done in
2.2.x, but I'm wondering what trickery if any can be done to
2.0.x to get it to work.
Any help would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks.
