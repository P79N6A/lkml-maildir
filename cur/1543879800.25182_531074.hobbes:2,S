The fsck for none of these filesystems will be able to deal with
a filesystem that big.  Unless, of course, you have a few weeks
to wait for fsck to complete.
Backup and restore are similar problems.  When part of the filesystem
is lost, you don't want to have to wait for a full restore.
Sounds simple?  Well, the hard part is figuring out exactly which
part of the filesystem you need to restore...
I don't see ZFS, ext4 or XFS addressing these issues.
IMHO chunkfs could provide a much more promising approach.
