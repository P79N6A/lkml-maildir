Good.. So, for 2.6, can we agree on doing "enum xxx" thing? That at
least serves as a documentation. We could teach sparse to check for
it... (Anything that does 
enum foo x;
enum bar y = x;
is broken. If gcc does not warn about this, we should fix gcc...)
I believe "enum system_state" passed around, even to PCI drivers, and 
enum pci_state to_pci_state(enum system_state) helper is the right
thing to do for 2.6. Can we agree on that?
