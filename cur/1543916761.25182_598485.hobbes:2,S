If you want to maintain the convention of documenting the interface only in .c files, 
you should write the convention in so many places in .h files that no one could overlook it.
But I think the convention is bad and it would be better to document the interface also in
.h files where it is defined. The convention is bad because it requires people to jump to
other files to understand .h files.
