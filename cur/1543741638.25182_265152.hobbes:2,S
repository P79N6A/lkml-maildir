That's what I mean when I say it can overscan the lower zones.
You don't want to change the stop condition here though because
obviously the highmem zone still has work to do - you just want
to stop scanning the lower zones.
I don't think it is a big problem though.
I do have a patch to make it use the lower zone protection watermarks
explicitly, but it is sitting on top of other stuff which I'm going
to try to get merged first...
