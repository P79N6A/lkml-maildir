You should fix the first paragraph, read
http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html
 if you don't know anymore what
free software is.
"at no charge" is questionable, Larry wants no money in some cases, but he
wants log entries, so please just link to the license ("bk help bkl" is
useless, if one just to know the licence) and advise the user to
carefully read it, before using bk.
bye, Roman
