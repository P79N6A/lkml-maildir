Ok, then some logic could be implemented in userland to take
appropriate actions. It must be ensured that zebra handles the
netlink notification fast enough.

In the manpages for send/sendto/sendmsg it says that there is a -ENOBUFS
return value, if a sockets write queue is full. It also says:
"Normally, this does not occur in Linux. Packets are just silently dropped
when a device queue overflows."
So, if packets are 'silently dropped' anyway, the fact that we drop them in
our driver (and increment the error count in the net_device_stats
accordingly)
should not be a problem.

I think that both behaviours are similar for TCP. TCP waits for ACKs for
each packet. If they do not arrive, a retransmit is done. Sooner or later
the connection will be reset, if no responses from the other side arrive.
So the result for both driver behaviours should be the same.
