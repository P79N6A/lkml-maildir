That line is more than 78 characters long, in violation of another
'RECOMMENDED' in §3.5 of RFC2822. You didn't present any justification
for violating §3.6.4 -- do you have any justification for this one?

It's not an unrelated rant. If you want to participate in a public
forum, you are expected to show a little bit of respect for netiquette.
I don't have anything to contribute to the thread -- it's not my area of
expertise. Hence I want to ignore the thread -- but that's not easy
since your broken MUA keeps creating _new_ threads.

I care not what it is; it's broken. Please stop using it in public fora.
I note that it also includes 8-bit data without Content-Type: or
Content-Transfer-Encoding: headers. According to §§5.2 and 6.1 of
RFC2045, the default values to be assumed in the absence of those
headers are 'text/plain; charset=us-ascii' and '7BIT' respectively. It
is therefore erroneous to use the octet 0xf6 where presumably you
intended the character 'ö', because that is not a valid US-ASCII
character, and because the octet 0xf6 is not permitted in '7bit' data.
