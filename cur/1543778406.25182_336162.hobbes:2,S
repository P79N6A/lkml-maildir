Hi Rogier,
Having just written a DMA UART driver I can say this
is good news :-). Here are some things to think about:
What my driver would like to do is to handle its own
input buffers. It would pass the buffer to the tty
layer when it is full and the tty layer would pass the
buffer back once it has drained the data from it.
The problem is that I don't always receive a block
worth of characters so I also need to pass the tty
layer a buffer (which I'm still DMAing into) with a
count of how many chars there are in the buffer and a
offset of where to start from. If I can't do this then
I have to stop the DMA transfer, pass you a mostly
empty buffer with a char count, and setup DMA transfer
into another buffer. If during this I get a burst of
data I could well lose it :-(.
Best Regards,
Mark
