I'm that much interested at SMP performance right now - most of the SMP
problems are bad interactions with the scheduler. The current scheduler
and the pipe implementation are "optimized" for each other, e.g.
wake_up_sync() is IIRC exclusively used by pipes.

I'll try to check that one ASAP. An uniprocessor performance degration
points to an implementation bug in my code.
