No idea :)
Though this update should solve several classes of longstanding bugs.
* irq-pio is much friendlier to the controller, and should eliminate 
several screaming interrupt problems, particularly on sata_sil.
* The better EH should allow recovery from problems we couldn't recover 
from before.
* The removal of assert()s (or, removal of conditions that caused 
asserts) that triggered in earlier kernels will also eliminate the 
associated forced oopsen.
But in the via+ATAPI case, the only thing I can think of is that VIA 
AHCI support is included in the update.  Other than that... <shrug>
