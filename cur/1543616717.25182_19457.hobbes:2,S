   True.  I was assuming that the context of the post was
   that the NICs were on the same network link.    
I didn't catch that bit.
   Solaris _defaults_ to using the MAC address from the 
   primary (hostname) NIC for the rest of them. 
This has nothing to do with Solaris, it has to do with
open firmware variable settings.  If there is a 'local-mac-address'
property in the device node for the ethernet card, that is what
the drivers use.  Otherwise they use the "host MAC".
If you look, this is what we do under Linux on Sparc too.
