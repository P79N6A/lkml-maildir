  Hi,
  is there a viable way to bind the racoon config to a specific
  interface?
  We need this in order to get transparent ipsec to work. 
  So far, the racoon config is global that is, all interfaces are
  affected. This results from the configurability based on network
  addresses only.
  What we have here is a bridge that needs to do an ipsec job.
  Thanks for ideas and hints!
    Nils
