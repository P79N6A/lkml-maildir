Possibly a good idea...

Possibly, but getting this detection right isn't easy.  There
are many other cases where processes such as the compiler do
so much disk access that it is interactive for some time, but
we definitely don't want it to become a hog at interactive
priority - ever.
There are also those who think that if X ever has so much to do 
(usually not because of graphichs acceleration) then it had
better wait because the X user isn't the only one waiting anyway.
(I.e. the machine is also a web/db/login server
or some such - so other people are waiting as well.)

More oscillation in the start than later will behave as you describe,
wether we want that is another issue.  Processes _can_
change between being hogs and interactive, and we want the
scheduler to pick up that fact quickly.
Example: a word processor is mostly interactive.  Sometimes it
does a heavy job like typesetting an entire book though, this is cpu
intensive and should schedule as such even if the word processor
has been "interactive" for a week.  (I never close it, linux
is so stable...)  It should do its heavy work with low priority
so it don't interfere with the interactive work (or gameplaying)
I do while waiting for the .pdf to appear.
I definitely don't want a 5-minute
typesetting run to monopolize the cpu just because the task
has been sooo nice over the last week.
