So far the requirements are pretty much not high resolution but is
accurate and increasing. so like 10ms is fine, the current X timer is
in the 20ms range.
I think an mmap'ed page with whatever cgt(CLOCK_MONOTONIC) returns
would be very good, but it might be nice to implement some sort of new
generic /dev that X can mmap and each arch can do what they want in
it,
I'm wondering why x86 doesn't have gettimeofday vDSO (does x86 have
proper vDSO support at all apart from sysenter?),
Dave.
