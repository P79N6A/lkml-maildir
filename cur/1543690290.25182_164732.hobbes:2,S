 As I have already written, the system uses a default MP configuration.
smp_read_mpc() isn't called at all.  construct_default_ISA_mptable() is
used instead.

 There is no need to -- the problem is already known.  Mikael, if you need
additional details on how default MP configurations work in our code, feel
free to ask.  Unfortunately, I won't likely be able to do any coding
and/or testing in this area before October.
