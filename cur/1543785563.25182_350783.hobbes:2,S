Firstly some devices do not honour nIEN.
Secondly IRQ delivery is asynchronous to all other busses (especially on
older SMP boxes)
ata_interrupt checks qc->tf.ctl & ATA_NIEN
Other functions set/reset nIEN in the tf they issue then directly call
ata_tf_load/ata_exec_* so I don't believe qc->tf.ctl is the correct
thing to check for non-interrupt status on older type controllers at
least.
Instead you need to look at ap->last_ctl. But that too looks suspect if
any kind of reset sets it back to an undefined state.
Finally I don't see what locks viewing ->tf.ctl/->last_ctl against
whether it has yet been loaded into the hardware.
