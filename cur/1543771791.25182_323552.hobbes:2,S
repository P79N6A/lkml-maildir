Why would it matter?  The driver shouldn't care if the interrupts come
in via the standard interrupt way, or through MSI, right?  And if it
does, it could always use a function like the one I proposed to set up a
different irq handler.

That's fine to disable msi, I don't have an issue with that.  I'm just
getting pushback from some vendors as to why MSI isn't explicitly
enabled by default and I don't have any solid answers.
