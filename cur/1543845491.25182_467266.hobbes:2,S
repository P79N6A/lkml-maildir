Reference the sentence before that.  The return value of the actor 
passed to device_for_each_child() is always either zero (for some 
actors) or one (for another actor).  In all cases, it is never variable.

Quite sloppy.  But that doesn't change the fact that 
device_for_each_child()'s actor _may_ hardcode the return value.  It's a 
valid usage model for that function.
If you are doing a simple collection of data -- adding items to a 
preallocating list or bitmap -- or doing a search, as with 
__remove_child() in drivers/scsi/scsi_sysfs.c, the return value can be 
quite useless.
The usage model should not be _forced_ upon the caller, since it might 
not be needed.
