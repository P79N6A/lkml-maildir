Hi all,
I'm back again, with yet another snapshot of modutils. Look at:
	<
http://www.pi.se/blox/modutils/>
 for "modutils-snap990215.tar.gz"
This version is a first step towards integration of modprobe and insmod,
which means that I have split depmod and modprobe into separate directories.
This also means that modprobe now compiles in straight C.
Just to take care of a possible misunderstanding from yesterday:
It was _not_ my intention that depmod and modprobe have to be written in C++.
I had to take care of a nasty (copyright) problem, quick as h-ll, and
that forced me to start with a version that did not have those problems.
I know this might be seen as a possible loss of tempo, but I'm trying to
compensate for that by doing as high-speed development as possible at the
moment.  So, please bear with me until you see that modutils have stabilized.
For now (i.e. today) modprobe is a separate executable.  I did it like
that so I could have a base for further clean-ups and modifications
before merging with insmod.  The merger is along the line that Jacques
and I discussed already back in -95 and -96, but we didn't have the
time to do it then.
I have already received many good patches for the utilities, and I
will first apply those that are intended for insmod.  When modprobe
looks more solid (say by Wednesday), I will have applied the modprobe
patches as well.  For depmod this process will take a few days more,
since I have another project running in parallel, and also since
depmod is not as critical as insmod/modprobe.
So, you can prepare patches for insmod without any problems, since
I plan no real changes there.  For modprobe and depmod the state
is in a flux, but I hope that you can at least see where I am aiming...
For now,
Björn Ekwall  <bj0rn@blox.se>
