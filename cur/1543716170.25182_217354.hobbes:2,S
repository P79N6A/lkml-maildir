Note that we should run this synchronously with userspace - ie, wait
for the userspace hotplug script to finish executing before moving
on to the next device.  Why?
Think of the case where we're suspending the complete system.  If you
go round and asynchonously try to run userspace scripts, chances are
you'll have the CPU asleep before _any_ of the scripts have run, which
means (eg) your DHCP client couldn't tell the server that its released
its allocation.
Also, should we be telling userspace about suspend before we actually
suspend the device?
