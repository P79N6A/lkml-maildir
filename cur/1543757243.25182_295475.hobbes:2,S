with hdc=scsi haldeamon doesn't recognize cdwriter.
but with hdc=ide-scsi (was the original from kernel 2.4) haldaamon
reconize my cdwriter !
So this message of this subject just make me wast my time and lose my

Still don't understand if I should or not change to ide-cd on my FC3, if
not please remove the message, if yes rewrite it please .
thanks for your precious time.
