Hi guys,
I've been swamped with work for the last few days and haven't been
able to spend the time I intended on the hdaps driver :-(   I have to
dedicate a few more days to other things, but then I hope to be able
to resume work on the driver.  I /will/ be looking at the patches,
comments, suggestions etc that people have send my way, but I won't be
doing so for the next few days.  I'm sorry, but things turned up that
I had not expected - that's real life for you I guess...
