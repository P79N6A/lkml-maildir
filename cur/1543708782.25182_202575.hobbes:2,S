Hi All
At current I try to use 2.6.2 kernel from debian distribution.
After start XFree I see 
==
atkbd.c: Unknown key released (translated set 2, code 0x7a on
isa0060/serio0).
==
Well, i search at list archives and see disable CONFIG_PREEMPT
can be solution at this situations. I disable it recompile kernel and
see XFree started without this messages.
After one-two hour i returned to work with this computer and see
messages again.
I think this problem is CONFIG_PREEMPT related, not a XFree bug.
