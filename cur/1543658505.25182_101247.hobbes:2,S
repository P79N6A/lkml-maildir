I have no problem to stream from there. kernel-source-2.4.19 here. several
tunnels in the middle and different brand of routers...
anyway Im farly sure that the xmms patch is not the problem. We have been
testing it for more than 6 months now (for inclusion in debian, we are
not the upstream) and yes we hit a similar problems with one icecast
server but at that time we didn't care too much since it was basically at
the first tests round. I will see if i can get it up and running again
(it is not under my control) and investigate a bit more into it.
Thanks
Fabio
