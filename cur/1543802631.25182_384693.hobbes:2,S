Much better now, but

Looking at how these are handled in x25_ioctl(),
these should be forwarded to x25_ioctl(), because they are
compatible. With your current code you incorrectly return -EINVAL.

This one actually needs a conversion handler. You could
add a generic compat_sock_get_timestamp() function to net/compat.c
for this.

These all return -EINVAL in x25_ioctl, just do the same here.
For any the cases above, you can also choose not to handle them
in compat_x25_ioctl at all and just return -ENOIOCTLCMD, so they
get forwarded to the conversion code in fs/compat_ioctl.c.

These should call x25_route_ioctl() instead of falling through to
to compat_x25_subscr_ioctl(), right?

I guess these can be combined to a single case list.
