Please, everybody,
don't change that.
I'm currently using that *feature* (yes, I see it as that) in my
fsvs-chrooter-utility (see
http://fsvs.tigris.org/source/browse/
*checkout*/fsvs/trunk/www/doxygen/html/group__howto__chroot.html)
for easier usage of fsvs on older systems.
- User starts a small wrapper,
- that opens "/",
- chroot()s into a directory and starts fsvs.
- fsvs gets its libraries loaded
- and chroot()s back to the original system.
Voila! fsvs can use the newest available libraries for that architecture,
without having to change the installed system.
Please, keep that feature - as already mentioned, UID 0 is required
anyway, and such processes can get out of (nearly) anything.
Regards,
Phil
