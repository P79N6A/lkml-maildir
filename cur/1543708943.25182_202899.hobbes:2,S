I disagree with the paragraph preceding my comment, which you removed to
take what I said out of context. And I still disagree. I "think I read" 
that just fine, although it may not correctly summarize the implementation
of the code.
In any case, as long as the code provides the protection against letting
users change priorities to hog resources I don't disagree with that.
Experience has shown that people WILL abuse any mechanism which gives them
an unfair share of a shared system. For home systems that's less
important, obviously.
