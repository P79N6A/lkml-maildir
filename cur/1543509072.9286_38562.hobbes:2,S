I've also seen this problem, but it happens every few days on a NFS
server with linux 2.2.12 UP + HJL's knfs patches.
I came with this patch to trace the problem:

+			       exp->ex_dentry, exp->ex_dentry->d_name.name);
 			goto out;
 		}
 	}
These are what I find in the log when the problem occurs:
kernel: nfsd Security: /// bad export. 
kernel:    dentry dump = C73F38A0 / 
kernel:    export dentry = C7DD2840 / 
Repeated a few gazillion times.
When the problem occurs, all clients experience a "stale NFS
file handle" on the affected share. After this ESTALE storm, everything
is back to normal (without remounting or anything...).
Still investigating, but help accepted :-)
Phil.
