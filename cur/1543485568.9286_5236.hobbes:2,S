Erm, if the pages aren't contiguous in physical memory (=vmalloc), you can't
DMA to them in one go, can you? (Not knowing much about it). Surely the code
would use vmalloc() by default otherwise. Maybe the floppy driver does
something funky to handle the vmalloc()'d memory, but on a SCSI device I'd
imagine the performance overhead would be such that it'd be better to just
drop the DMA buffer size back.

I'm guessing your SCSI controller just DMA'd over the top of something
critical (kernel code, page table, ...).
