I just noticed these errors in my log as well. Something is weird with my 
swapping I think. If I get Oops that say "Unable to handle kernel paging 
request at virtual address ff7f1014" would that not be swap since it is 
virtual? 
The errors that make me think it may be with my swapper are as follows.
Nov 12 21:12:51 phlegmish kernel: swap_free: Trying to free nonexistent 
swap-page
Nov 12 21:12:51 phlegmish kernel: swap_free: Trying to free nonexistent 
swap-page
Nov 14 02:57:28 phlegmish rc.sysinit: Enabling swap space:  succeeded 
Nov 14 03:01:51 phlegmish kernel: swap_free: offset exceeds max
Nov 14 03:01:51 phlegmish kernel: swap_free: offset exceeds max
Nov 14 03:17:37 phlegmish kernel: swap_free: Trying to free nonexistent 
swap-page
Nov 14 03:17:37 phlegmish kernel: swap_free: Trying to free nonexistent 
swap-page
And so on......
I tried deleting my swap partiton and recreating it but that made no 
difference.  Any ideas or things to try?
Thanks for the help so far
