Which is why I want the driver to initialise the card to "known-good" settings.
Defaulting to 0 is not good enough.
With my approach, the driver is loaded as part of the kernel, but does NOT
initialise the card, it just confirms it is there. Then, during boot, a script
will initialise the sound card with the correct settings explicitly. That way,
the delay between card init and the card getting the correct settings is
minimal, even on broken hardware like this.
