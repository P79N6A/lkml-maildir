The patch is checking for hashed aliases of an inode.  E.g. if /foo is
a directory and has a ID of 28, and mkdir /bar returns the same ID,
then the mkdir should fail.
It's an illegal for the filesystem to create two directories refering
to the same inode.
OTOH d_add_unique() is looking for unhashed aliases to resurrect,
which may or may not make sense in fuse.  I'll think about it a bit
more.
Thanks,
Miklos
