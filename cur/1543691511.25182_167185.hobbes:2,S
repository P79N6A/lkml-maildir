You probably mean S-states, which are for sleep.

Now you've confused me.
Do your comments above apply to "uhci" or "usb-uhci"?
Please allow me to restate the original problem:
  -- I usually use uhci instead of usb-uhci, because it is able to go
     into "suspend mode" when no devices are plugged, which allows the
     CPU to enter C3 states,
  -- usb-uhci eats CPU power by keeping it in C2 constantly because of
     busmastering DMA activity, therefore being much less useful,
  -- uhci generally works for me just fine, but breaks in one particular
     case, when removing the device causes a strange message to be
     printed and the system being unable to use the C3 states again,
     until uhci is unloaded and reloaded back again.
     Just as a reminder, this message is:
       uhci.c: efe0: host controller halted. very bad
I hope if the message says "very bad", then this is something that can
be fixed. I was therefore reporting a problem with "uhci" and kindly
asking for help.
