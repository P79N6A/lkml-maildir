I assume this has been asked and answered by whats the advantage of this
in_exec flag over a single function that set the security domain, oncee
at the beginning of exec to set the new domain (B) and once in the
fail/exit path to reset it back (to A) in case of failure.
the only difference I can see is that you want what is basically a 3rd
security domain of "execing B".
The question would then be, why is "execing B" different than B itself?
otherwise, the same changes you do to set/unset the in_exec flag could
be used to set and reset the security domains.
it just seems weird to say that we are technically in security domain A,
but are going to treat the process as if its in security domain B when
you can just as easily put it in security domain B and put it back in
security domain A if the operation fails.
but again, I could very well be missing something.
