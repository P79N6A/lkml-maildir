People around XFree tell you to _never_ allow people running
startx. xdm is preffered method... (Well, I still use startx ;-).

Just guessing, but it is generally bad idea to hit X with kill
-9. When you shutdown and X are running, that _might_ happen. I do not
know consequences - trashed display is the obvious one.

PS: Really, X is not normal app. It has root privileges and direct
access to hardware. You better be carefull.
PPS: Do you want to crash machine? Nearly any machine running
linux+X... Start few processess, get few MB into swap. Now start
switching to/from X windows. This works on 2.1.70 sparclinuxes in
school, linux 2.0.30 + X with s3 in school, it used to work on my old
486 with tvga8900... You can get it to unusable console (tvga8900,
sparc) or even complete system freeze (s3). 
Linux console has design problems (KDSETMODE is working on _current_
console. but what if someone changes console in between? how do you
get new console? OPENQUERY + ACTIVATE. Aha, but there's race between
those two.)
I'd clean that up... But I'm afraid linus will just kill such
interface change...
