Yes, there is. Locality. Resistance to fs fuckups. Resistance to disk
fuckups. Easier to restore from tape. Different tunefs optimum (higher
inodes/blocks ratio, for one thing). Ability to keep /usr read-only.
Enough?

What desktops? None of that crap on my boxen either. EMACS? What EMACS?
LaTeX is unfortunately needed (I prefer troff and AMSTeX on the TeX side).
Netrape? No chance in hell. bash <spit> is there, but I prefer to use
rc.
I don't see what does it have to keeping root on a separate filesystem,
though - the reasons have nothing to bloat in /usr/bin.
