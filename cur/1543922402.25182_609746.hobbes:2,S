Subject: [PATCH] Remove #warnings for longstanding conditions.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/10/25/74

These two warnings...
drivers/isdn/capi/capidrv.c:2126:3: warning: #warning FIXME: maybe a
race condition the card should be removed here from global list /kkeil
drivers/scsi/advansys.c:71:2: warning: #warning this driver is still
not properly converted to the DMA API
...represent conditions that have existed for years, and are duly noted
in FIXMEs.  There does not seem to be much need to warn on every kernel
build for a driver bug or handicap that has existed for years.
