I just tried 2.6.13-rc6 after my last 2.6.11.12 and got a problem with
the onboard aic7xxx on my old Gigabyte-6BXDS dual i686-600: During boot,
something bad happened within domain validation and I got an oops from
an unhandled NULL pointer. Since I don't have a secondary computer at
home to capture the OOPS, here's the shortened stacktrace written down
by hand:
	show_stack
	show_register
	die
	do_page_fault
	error_code
	ahc_set_syncrate
	ahc_reset_channel
	ahc_linux_bus_reset
	scsi_try_bus_reset
	scsi_eh_bus_reset
	scsi_eh_ready_devs
	scsi_unjam_host
	scsi_error_handler
	kernel_thread_helper
After chaning the Adaptec bios setting for the Pioneer CDROM from
"async" to "10 MB", I was able to boot the same kernel without problems.
If somebody needs more information, I can reproduce the OOPS again and
provide the missing information.
BYtE
Philipp
