Commits e0ad7b073eb7317e5afe0385b02dcb1d52a1eedf and 
c37ef806a3e1c0bca65fd03b7590d56d19625da4 move the following check from 
ext3_xattr_user_set() to xattr_permission(), which is used in vfs_getxattr() 
as well as xfs_setxattr() and vfs_removexattr(), so this added the check to 
the xfs_getxattr() path by accident:
[]	if (!S_ISREG(inode->i_mode) &&
[]	    (!S_ISDIR(inode->i_mode) || inode->i_mode & S_ISVTX))
[]		return -EPERM;
The check itself completely forbids user.* xattrs for sticky directories 
already though, and this conflicts with the xattr(5) manual page as well as 
the xfs code. It looks as if the ckeck was more strict than intended since 
forever. The patch I have sent relaxes the unintended restriction.

I don't think we'll need backports; this doesn't address a security problem.
Thanks,
