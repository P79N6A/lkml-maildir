This may filter out too much - we have symbols starting with a '.' on
ARM, particularly used in some of the assembly code, which are useful
to be decoded back to names, such as ".bug".
However, including "." means that names like "__func__.0" also get
included, which is probably a bad thing.  So, maybe it needs to be
[A-Za-z0-9_\.][A-Za-z0-9_]*
?
