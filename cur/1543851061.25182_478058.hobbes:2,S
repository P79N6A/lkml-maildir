Bingo. We crossed mails!
Kirill/Pavel,
	As I mentioned in the begining of this thread, one of the
objective of this RFC is to seek consensus on what could be a good
compromise for the infrastructure in going forward. Paul Menage's
patches, being rework of existing code, is attactive to maintainers like
Andew. 
From that perspective, how well do you think the container
infrastructure patches meet your needs?
