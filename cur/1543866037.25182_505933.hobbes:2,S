Stacked GIT 0.12 release is available from 
http://www.procode.org/stgit/.
StGIT is a Python application providing similar functionality to Quilt
(i.e. pushing/popping patches to/from a stack) on top of GIT. These
operations are performed using GIT commands and the patches are stored
as GIT commit objects, allowing easy merging of the StGIT patches into
other repositories using standard GIT functionality.
The main features in this release:
    * New 'rebase' command to change the base of an StGIT stack
    * New 'hide' and 'unhide' commands to act on the patches in a
series. Additional options were added to 'series' for displaying the
hidden patches
    * New 'sync' command to synchronise same patches in different branches
    * New 'assimilate' command to transform GIT (accidental) commits
at the top of the stack in StGIT patches
    * Re-worked pulling logic to use the branch information stored in
the .git/config file
    * Abbreviation for StGIT commands
    * Correct encoding of the e-mail headers and body
    * Support for importing multipart e-mails and mbox files
    * Configuration read from the GIT config files rather than stgitrc
    * Patch ranges can be specified for 'export'
    * '--missing' option for 'series' to list the patches on a branch
which are missing in current
    * StGIT bash completion script
    * Bug fixes
