I get a strange build error in aic7xxx. I don't see a compile error, but my
make stops with an error.
Starting from scratch with a 'make oldconfig'.

I'm fairly sure it is not the last CC that causes the make to stop. If I
run gcc by hand it completes with exit 0. However, if I run make again, it
does the CC again. Huh? What can it be?
How can I see the whole gcc command?
