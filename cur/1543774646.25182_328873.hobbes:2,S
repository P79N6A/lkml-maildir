No, you seemed convinced that you'd have a big win based on the fact that
big chunks don't get unpacked - when in fact it's not as much of a win as
you might think.
And at least in the real world, performance *does* matter - if doing it the
traditional way is 3 times faster, nobody's going to be interested.

"Here's a new facility.  Don't bother trying to actually use it".
