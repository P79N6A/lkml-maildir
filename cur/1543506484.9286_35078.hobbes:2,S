Actually, any router can fragment if the DF (Don't Fragment) bit is unset,
only the end point is supposed to reassemle.  The kernel can be configured
to reassemble all packets, though, and this is advisable under the
circumstance that the router is acting as a firewall _and_ is the only
ingress point to the firewalled network.  The thing that makes it possible
is the fact that all packets destined to the network go through that
router.  IIRC, it is also required in order to masqerade (perform NAT).
