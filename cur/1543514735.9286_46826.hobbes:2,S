I hope you don't check *outside* the predefined memory map, or you'll
die horribly on some systems.  This kind of test certainly can be
useful to *remove* some stuff, but never add.
Also, don't expect it to detect anything reliable (think of a video
card in the 15-16M memory hole.)  Rather, think of it as a "last
ditch" sanity check.  It probably should print a major warning if it
ever needs to make any adjustments.
