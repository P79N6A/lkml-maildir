Umm.. Complain more. I upgrade kernels a lot more often than I upgrade 
distros, and things don't break. They're not allowed to break, because I 
refuse to upgrade my user programs just because I do kernel development. 
But I'd only notice a small part of user space, so if people don't 
complain, they break not because we don't care, but because we didn't even 
know.
So if you have a user program that breaks, _complain_. It's really not 
supposed to happen outside of perhaps kernel module loaders etc things 
that get really really chummy with kernel internals (and even that was 
fixed: the modern way of loading modules isn't that chummy any more, so 
hopefully we'll not need to break even module loaders again).
If we change some /proc file thing, breakage is often totally 
unintentional, and complaining is the right thing - people might not even 
have realized it broke.
At least _I_ take breakage reports seriously. If there are maintainers 
that don't, complain to them. I'll back you up. Breaking user space simply 
isn't acceptable without years of preparation and warning.
