It is certainly to much at one time, and the code while semanticly 
interesting is still has significant issues with the implementation.
But a lot of the ugliness is inherent in the current implementation of
/proc and not what I am trying to do with it.

An instance of /proc being connected to a pid space is perfectly
natural.  /proc is after all the filesystem that reports what is in a
pspace.
I freely admit the way I am using the internal mount of proc is
wrong, and is something that needs to be resolved before I submit
this for kernel inclusion.  I was attempting to solve the problem
of having duplicate dcache entries in my recursive structure.
Unfortunately it was one of those clever solutions that only gets
you 99% of the way to where you want to go.

Yes.

proc is the painful for any pid change in how pids are dealt with.
So far I have not seen a single implementation that cleanly and
correctly addresses all of the issues (including mine :)
