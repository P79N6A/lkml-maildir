Hello,
There is a little bug in the kernel file drivers/sound/Config.in for ARM
machines.
When I do make xconfig, an error shows up. The cause is in line 11 of
this file :
if [ "$CONFIG_SA1100_ASSABET" = "y" -o "$CONFIG_SA1100_BITSY" = "y" -o \
     "$CONFIG_SA1100_PANGOLIN" = "y" -o $CONFIG_SA1100_FREEBIRD = "y" -o
\
     "$CONFIG_SA1100_YOPY" = "y" ]; then
    dep_tristate '  Assabet/Bitsy/Pangolin/Yopy audio support (UDA1341)'
CONFIG_SOUND_UDA1341 $CONFIG_SOUND
fi                                 
Note that $CONFIG_SA1100_FREEBIRD must be quoted :
"$CONFIG_SA1100_FREEBIRD".
That's all.
Thank you for your work.
Jordi Colomer.
