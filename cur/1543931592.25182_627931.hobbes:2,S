Simulating 1 microsecond delays (assuming LPC meets that goal for 0x80) 
is "absolutely correct" for devices provided on PCI-X running on 3 GHz 
or greater machines?
Well, you are entitled to your opinion.   Seems likely that reading the 
timing specs of such a chipset might be correct, and delaying for a time 
proportional to CPU speed, rather than assuming running 3000 3GHz clock 
cycles is needed on a very fast emulation of an old device that probably 
runs at the fastest bus speed provided in the chipset.
Every device has different timing constraints.  In the real world that I 
live in.
