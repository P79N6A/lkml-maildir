	If you're doing this to defeat a program's security or licensing scheme, let 
me warn you that there are many ways this could be detected. Inconsistencies 
in different time functions, filesystem times that are way ahead of system 
time, times built into networking protocols (and thus received from remote 
machines), detection of times before other run time, and so on.
