Yeas and no. No, it is NOT normal - shared memory should not be displayed
as 0. And yes it IS normal since it's well-known problem of VERY low
priority: it does not trigger bugs in code, it does not crash system and so
on so we can live with it for 2.4.0. In 2.4.<something-big> it will be fixed,
I hope.
