The above should work now, PROVIDED that the end has been marked
properly. I have added some helpers to init an sglist (or sg entry).
You can still use
        for_each_sg()
and pass in the number of entries, that'll work even with an end marker.
So, it does both.

Heh, got some of it covered! The stack usage is generally just converted
to either use sg_init_one() if we can, or sg_init_table(). Adding some
soft of DECLARE_SCATTERLIST() sounds like a good idea, though. I'll take
patches :-)

Driver that do all their own sg management typically still use a manual
loop over the number of entries they know are there. I didn't change
those, and the original sg chaining didn't convert those either. Some
manual labor is required in utilizing chained sg lists, unless you are
part of a subsystem (like SCSI) that allocates and inits themf or you.
So I still think that baby steps are a good idea - only convert things
that matter. Leave the rest to janitors or others willing to dive in.
