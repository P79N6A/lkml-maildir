on a related node, i've noticed that the linux ide driver uses the drives
"DMA" handshaking setting to enable/disable the BM DMA. is there any
particular reason for this, i.e., can't the ATA controller do DMA to
memory while doing PIO handshaking to the drive ? i'm not familiar with
the PC ata controller.
most cdroms don't advertise any ATA DMA handshaking capability (because
they might not have any) and thus the linux driver uses massive amounts of
CPU time reading from them.
