It's already fixed in the network stack for at least the most important
protocols. The 2.4 stack supports iovecs of pages in skbs and also linked
lists of skbs for a single packet. The biggest killer used to be 
defragmentation; that will just pass around a linked list now. There are
cases where defragmentation-into-a-big-buffer is still needed (e.g. for 
most of netfilter), but fixing that is just small incremental change.
