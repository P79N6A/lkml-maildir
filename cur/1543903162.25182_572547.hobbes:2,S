That's exactly my point.  As far as I know nobody has done a survey,
but I bet you'd find _many_ drivers are buggy either in this way or the
converse (forcing an I/O request to fail immediately instead of waiting
until the suspend is over when it could succeed).  They have this bug 
because they were written -- those which include any suspend/resume 
support at all -- under the assumption that they could rely on the 
freezer.
And that's why Rafael said "We can't do this unless we have frozen
tasks (this way, or another) before carrying out the entire operation."  
Until the drivers are fixed -- which seems like a tremendous job --
none of this will work.

Many drivers don't have request queues.  Even for the ones that do, 
there are I/O pathways that bypass the queue (think of ioctl or sysfs).

Some drivers need the ability to schedule.  Some will need the ability 
to allocate memory (although GFP_ATOMIC is probably sufficient).  Some 
will need timers to run.

Yes we do.
