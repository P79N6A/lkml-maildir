I still have the wacky plan to write a simple crash dumper in
assembler. Goal is to code it up in less than 4k of memory, put a
checksum check in it to ensure clean code and dump to ide, but
anything else is fine as well.
The easy parts are already finished. :) But now it's time to look up
the hardware manuals and I got distracted.
Should be quite similar to the BIOS idea, even nearly as safe. As long
as the code path to jump into the (BIOS) dump code is intact, chances
are good that 4k of memory somewhere are intact as well.
