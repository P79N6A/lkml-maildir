 OK, I've browsed through the code and as of 2.4.0-test8 it seems to be
reasonable.  Messages printed by polarity/trigger functions are a bit
cryptic but it should not be a problem.  The real showstopper is
pin_2_irq() but this one cannot probably be modified in a generic way, so
interrupts from unknown busses will not work even if their polarity and
trigger mode are specified explicitly.  I think we can leave this as is
until someone reports an affected configuration.
