An interesting unsolved problem.
[Your discussion confuses a few things, especially in the context
of removable devices: a uuid lives on the disk, the C,B,T,U tends
to identify the drive rather than the disk.]

Yes. I took your patch, ported it to 2.5, and tried it out.
# cat /proc/scsi/map
# C,B,T,U       Type    onl     sg_nm   sg_dev  nm      dev(hex)

Very good - in combination with /proc/scsi/scsi this gives
good information. I like it.
But just "cat /proc/scsi/map" is not good enough.
>From the above output alone one cannot easily guess which is which.
One would need a small utility that reads /proc/scsi/map and
/proc/scsi/scsi and produces something readable.
Will add sth to util-linux in case this gets accepted.
