I/O APIC is very bad thing with Longhaul, but You don't have 
local APIC, so it shouldn't be used.

Looks like it isn't.

This is pointing to I/O APIC, but I don't see later that 
such high interrupts are used. And if I/O APIC would be in 
use You would have lockup in the moment of transition.
I was suspecting:

because I know that VT8237 has HPET built in. But I don't see any lines 
starting with "hpet: enabled" or something similar. But I don't know 
what to search for. I didn't have contact with HPET earlier.
It is very similar and Your problem with ondemand is starting right 
after

I don't see such message as long as "performance" governor is used. 
Anyway adding "hpet=disable" at boot should confirm for sure that it 
isn't it. And I think that John already ruled this out by 
clocksource=acpi_pm.
Sorry
