If you're looking to mmap dma memory, ARM already supports the API
which was discussed (although not properly imho) on linux-arch.
I previously posted a potential patch for x86, but it has the
problem that remap_pfn_range() will not work on such memory because
it isn't marked reserved.
In addition, if you're mmaping dma memory on x86 as is, you're
providing a potential security hole - the x86 DMA memory allocator
does not extend its zeroing to cover the entire last page of the
allocation.
