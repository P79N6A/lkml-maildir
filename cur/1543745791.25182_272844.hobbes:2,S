Bullshit...
Well... In an ideal world, the video chip would come up all back by
itself and nobody would have to care... unfortunately we aren't in an
ideal world.
With the way video cards are evolving, we'll soon have no choice but
have a kernel driver bring the chip back. Userspace has nothing to do
with that, and userspace & kernel aren't fighting over it.
