No. I unplugged power, removed battery and left it over night. Today morning 
it has shown exactly the same behavior upon resuming (well, upon power-on 
after suspend to disk :))
To recap - this never happens upon simple power off; I do not remember this to 
happen upon suspend to disk until 2.6.19 (I won't claim it never happened, 
just that I do not remember it). This happens consistently in 2.6.19-rc5. I 
am very curious which hardware issue may have such pattern. And in any case 
this does smell like regression (earlier version not triggering this HW issue 
if any)
