I create a directory in /tmp and set $TMP to that directory, because I 
can't just mount a private tmpfs. But that's another topic.

ACK, with respect to lifetime and processes affected, it will be exactly
like creating/using a directory in a tmpfs. But as you noticed, you'd need
the shell builtin command to make this analogy complete. That's not going
to happen, but it's not needed for operation.

Exactly. You can't patch all login daemons, so you'll need pam to do the
initial setup.
After that, the users may decide to ignore having a private namespace (it
will just DTRT), or they can decide to use that feature to lock in some of
their programs. Obviously pam won't allow private sub-namespaces at random
times, while the general system call would support this, and their shell
won't do that, too. In the same way you'll need a wrapper like "#!/bin/sh
cd $dir&&exec $prog" for doing the initial chdir on behalf of
chdir-ignorant programs, you'll need a wrapper for setnamespace-ignorant
programs. The only difference is that chdir-ignorant programs are rare.

For the analogy yes, for usage no.
