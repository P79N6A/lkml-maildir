This could be it. But can you check whether your previous well-behaving
kernel also has CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC on? If so, then it is possible
that VM behaviour has regressed.
Of course, DEBUG_PAGEALLOC is the wrong target to attempt to tune for:
without it, those above two items would take up a combined 40 megs.

Well it doesn't seem to have caused too much trouble as yet... But it
is the obvious candidate if your problems continue. If you are not a
bk user, the attached patch will also revert that change.
