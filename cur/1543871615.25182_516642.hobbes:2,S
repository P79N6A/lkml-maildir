Thanks for you understanding, but now we want to move to use
CONFIG_BLACKFIN options. There is a new task in our development plan to
change things to CONFIG_BLACKFIN.
At this moment, we both provide CONFIG_BFIN and CONFIG_BLACKFIN. When
all the things relied on CONFIG_BFIN/bfin are changed to
CONFIG_BLACKFIN/blackfin, the CONFIG_BFIN will be removed.
So here I will follow Jean's comments.

So it is ok  for both blackfin and bluefin. But I think Black is cooler
than Blue. -:)

Thanks a lot, could you please give me a script just to kill this
whitespace? So I can do it before sending you patches.
Thanks Jean and Andrew.
