That is amazingly specific - I suppose using it for cache affinity on
earlier processors wouldn't count :)
Joking aside, this doesn't seem like it would apply to Linux's scheduler.
We don't use a global queue, and we don't implement hard affinities with
local queues, but with a specific bitmask of cpus.
Of course, I don't really have any idea how to interpret patents...
