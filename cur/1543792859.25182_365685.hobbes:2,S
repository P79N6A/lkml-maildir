I've put a new patch up which fixes the enablebits problems. It's not
really there for people to run off and test but because it now has a
full set of "first guess" hpt3xx driver code.
I've been through various drivers and tried to work out what we actually
should be doing with these chips. I'd appreciate review of that and
opinions from other folks hacking on hpt pata stuff.
