Subject: [PATCH/RFC] b44 and sundance watchdog changes.

Hi, 
I experimented some with the watchdog timers in these drivers because i
had some problems with em.
sundance.c:
I first raised this to 8 (and had no problems with it) but since too
many watchdog 'resets' breaks the hardware to the point where you have
to actually shutdown the machine for a while, i thought, better safe
than sorry.
b44.c:
My first try was to raise the timer to 10, but i actually got a failure,
so i increased it again by a 5s increment.
This was tested while transfering ~20 gigs of data via nfs.
The only problem that i experienced during this time is 2x:
b44: eth0: Link is down.
b44: eth0: Link is up at 100 Mbps, full duplex.
b44: eth0: Flow control is on for TX and on for RX.
There was no messages at all from the sundance driver, it worked
perfectly.
Comments? suggestions?
PS. Sorry, couldn't find anyone listed in maintainers, so module authors
was added to CC =P
CC me since i'm not subscribed.
DS.
