This just indicates that the interface needs to be richer -- i.e.,
such as having a "lazy timer" that means: "wake me up when _at least_
N ns have elapsed, but there's no hurry."  If waking you up at N ns
is expensive, then the wakeup is delayed until something else
interesting happens.
This is effectively what we have now anyway.  Perhaps the
current add_timer() should be mapped to lazy timers.
