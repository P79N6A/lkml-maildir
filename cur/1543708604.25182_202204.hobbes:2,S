Do these 'issues' prevent the cards from being used at all in 64bit mode on 
AMD-64?
We'd really like to use the 4-port SATA 3Ware card on a Tyan Thunder K8W 
(S2885) but it'd be a bit of a waste if we can only use it in 32bit mode. (I 
assume 32bit mode means you compile for i686 instead of AMD-64 ?)
Mark.
