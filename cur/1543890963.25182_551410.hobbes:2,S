Hi Lee,
There are various reports of users getting 40MB/s == 38.1MiB/s with
UDMA mode 6 media readers (which are few and far between):

If a particular reader is able to get 40MB/s through the CF interface,
then this most likely will be achievable with ICH8+Linux also, but
perhaps parameters need to be tuned or the right IDE configuration
needs to be reached etc.
