Before you get your hopes up, this development model is not one that will get
your code merged upstream. You should really try to work with Alex, not side
step him. Drivers are rarely complex enough to warrant, or even have room for, a
rewrite. And judging from your code it looks more like reorganising the code
that's already there.
In short, this "rewrite" won't fly. Report the issues you have with the current
driver and work with the existing maintainer to get them fixed.
