Hi,
while playing with the linux-2.2-pre4 kernel I found the following 
bugs by using `make menuconfig':
1.) Processor type and features -> Processor family -> Help
    The `Help' section say to use "Pentium" for AMD K5/K6/K6-3D but
    the menu point say `PPro/K6/6x86MX' (Pentium Pro)
2.) Networking options -> Netlink device emulation
    This menu entry appears with "< >" which will normally indicate
    an option which is also possible to build as a module. But you
    can't choose to build this as a module.
    Further more, all other option like this you can toggle with the
    spacebar. However, this entry you can only switch off by hitting
    the spacebar and switch on by hitting the return key.
    This looks a little bit broken.
3.) Following menu entries don't have help available (only checked a few):
    SCSI support -> SCSI low-level drivers -> IOMEGA ZIP Plus drive SCSI support
    SCSI support -> SCSI low-level drivers -> Initio 9100U(W) support
    IrDA subsystem support -> IrDA protocol options
    IrDA subsystem support -> Infrared-port device drivers -> Serial dongle support
