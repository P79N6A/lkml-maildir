Is that a large IA64 system?

The basic concept looks good to me, but I would suggest you use
the Linux bitmap functions (DECLARE_BITMAP(), set_bit, test_bit etc.)
instead of open coding all that.
And for the e1000 change - instead of adding a big switch with
magic numbers that will likely bitrot it's better to use 
the driver_data field in pci_device_id for such device specific flags.
