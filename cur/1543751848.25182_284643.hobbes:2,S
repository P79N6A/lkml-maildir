Subject: CONFIG_SCSI_QLA2<tripleX> looks dead - could it be removed ?

Hoping that this time the gmail filter doesn't bounce my subject (doh)
Said entry only appears in defconfigs, but doesn't seem to be actually
used by anyone - at least according to this grep:
[asuardi@incident linux]$ find . -type f | xargs grep
CONFIG_SCSI_QLA2XXX | grep -v defconfig
./drivers/scsi/Makefile:obj-$(CONFIG_SCSI_QLA2XXX)      += qla2xxx/
./include/linux/autoconf.h:#define CONFIG_SCSI_QLA2XXX_MODULE 1
./.config:CONFIG_SCSI_QLA2XXX=m
./.config.old:CONFIG_SCSI_QLA2XXX=m
[asuardi@incident linux]$
Moreover, there doesn't seem to be any entry in kbuild menus to
 turn it off. Even taking it out of my .config and running oldconfig
 brings it back in.
