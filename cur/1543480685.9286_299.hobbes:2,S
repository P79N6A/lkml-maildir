I complained about this a while ago.
I even posted a patch ( or maybe I didn't , can't remember ... )
The author/maintainer/somebody-else  said that it works OK
if compiled with the 2.0.x kernel includes.
Or maybe some includes from modutils should be replaced by the kernel ones.
Try to search the mail list archive.
IIRC it is actually a bug in the modutils , but the responsible person
is probably too lazy to fix it :-)
