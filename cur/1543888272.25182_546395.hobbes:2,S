Aside from using branch constructs or hints that help the predictor
guess the right way... I think gcc will move unlikely paths right past
the end of the "likely" fastpath, so it can increase code size and be
somewhat suboptimal in terms of icache usage.
I don't know particularly why it would hurt a lot more when it goes
wrong than it helps when it goes right, though.
Also, I don't think I agree that it should be used where it is correct
for all users. We make rt_task unlikely in the scheduler, and I measured
that a very long time ago was IIRC good for nearly 5% pipe based context
switching peformance. Systems running a lot of rt tasks aren't going to
like it, but bugger them :)
