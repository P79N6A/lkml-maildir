Right.  It's not a very good solution, just one of many hacks that might 
work :(
What if we kept a value (in per-CPU or per-thread memory) that was a 
pointer to the last r/w lock we'd gained?  When we release ANY r/w lock, 
we could blindly initialize the "lastLock" pointer back to NULL.  Then 
we have a very quick (i.e. not very good) heuristic for detecting 
recursive locks; if the "lastLock" pointer equals the pointer to the 
thing you're about to try to lock, then you know that you already hold 
it and are about to grab it recursively...otherwise, you fall back to 
other routines.
If you really wanted, you could keep multiple pointers per CPU (exact 
number tunable by a kernel #define), and on release only clear the one 
you are actually releasing.  Most builds, I imagine, wouldn't need more 
than just a single pointer, though.
