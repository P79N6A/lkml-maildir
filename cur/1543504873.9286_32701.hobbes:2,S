     Benjamin LaHaise sent me a very small patch, as follows:
 -----
Hello Robert,
If the lockup your system is triggering matches that someone else is
seeing (it looks like it =), then the following fix should work: in
kernel/fork.c around line 613, change the p->processor = NO_PROC_ID; to
p->processor = current->processor;  Apparently this fix will be included
in 2.2.11.

     I applied this and both machines ran for about 27 hours, one is still
running OK, but the other crashed and burned with:

     Then there would be a few blank lines and the whole sequence would repeat.

f0035164 T exit_mm

f00356ec T do_exit
f0035a7c T sys_exit
     Also, another oddity, frequently when it gets in this state, L1-A won't
work and I have to power cycle the machine.  But on those occasions where it
does work (like this time), I get the PROM monitor prompt and it responds and
interacts normally, but the messages keep printing as well.  A reset or reboot
at that point restors things to normality.
