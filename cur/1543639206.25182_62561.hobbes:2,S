Guys,
	Thanks for the answers!  In doing research on those options I too
found that they were not need for Hyperthreading, but I needed something
more to back up opinion.
Thanks Again.

I thikn none is needed for ht. Of course, mtrr raises performance.
The other are not needed, afaik.

No.
In summary, with 2.4.19 you do not have to do nothing to have
hyperthreading.
Other useful options are 'noht' to disable ht, and 'idle=poll', that I think
improves latency.
