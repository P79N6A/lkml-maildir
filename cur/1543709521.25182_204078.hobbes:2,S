Python does a good job at falling over loudly whenever anything
unexpected happens. I hadn't noticed that the snapshot directory got
purged. Hmmm. The right thing is to make it fall back to checking old/
where the most recent -bk is to be found. Like this:
$ kpatchup -s 2.6-pre
2.6.4-rc2
$ kpatchup -s 2.6-bk
2.6.4-rc1-bk4
New version at

I've added a couple other niceties for scripting purposes: a -p option
which will report the "base" version for a given version, -m which
will parse Makefile and print the version therein.

I skimmed latest-kernel-version, is it doing something my -s option
doesn't do yet?
