I don't see what Pavel's issue is with this: it's simply a fact that
with a 64-bit kernel, we've lots of virtual address space to spare
for vmalloc.  What would be surprising is for VmallocUsed to get up
as high as that.

Completely different and much more interesting.

Unlikely.  Offhand I'm not quite sure that's impossible, but it's far
more likely that we've a kernel bug and vm_committed_space has wrapped
negative.
Ancient as your kernel is, I don't notice anything in the ChangeLogs
since then to say we've fixed a bug of that kind since 2.6.19.
Any idea how to reproduce this?  Are you using HugePages at all?
(It's particularly easy for us to get into a muddle over them,
though historically I think mremap has proved most difficult for
Committed_AS accounting).
Thanks,
Hugh
