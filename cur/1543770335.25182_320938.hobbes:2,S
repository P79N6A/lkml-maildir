I also saw a good boost from NCQ on the qstor driver (full version,
not the libata subset) last year.  Very good for busy servers
and RAID arrays.

In this bit (above), is it possible for this code to ever
be invoked from a SCHED_RR or SCHED_FIFO context?
If so, it will lock out all lower-priority processes
for the duration of the polling interval.
