In theory this is not the case. In practice I believe the general Uk policy
is for all companies to feign ignorance in the utterly remote case that a 
telco comes after you. Which works for everyone but the very large folks.
Passive TA's in the UK need approval, either the UK approval or the EU
wide one. The approval is on a card/software combination basis and pretty
expensive. Sufficiently so that there are vendors who ship low end active
TA's to avoid the mess.
