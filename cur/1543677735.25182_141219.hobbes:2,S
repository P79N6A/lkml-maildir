Hello,
I've been using the packet writing patches floating around for some
time, and find them very useful.  I have modified slightly a recent
one to work with 2.4.21-rc8.  It worked with the IDE CD-ROM driver
(that is, /dev/hdc), but with the ide-scsi driver at /dev/scd0, it
would read but threw up a write error every time a modification was
attempted.
Has anyone made a packet writing patch compatible with 2.4.21 that
works with ide-scsi?
My workaround to date has been to unload the ide-scsi module and
insert the IDE cdrom module when I want to use packet writing, and do
the reverse when I want to use cdrecord.  It's quite annoying and I'd
rather just use one device the whole time.
Thanks,
John Goerzen
