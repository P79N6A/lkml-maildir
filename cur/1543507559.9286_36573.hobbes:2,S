Since some mirrors rejected the attached patch as
too large, Metafile patch against 2.3.15 now available at:
 
http://www.ipinc.net/~bhobbs/linux/
Actually this is essentially the same as previous patch with
two changes;
    1. Bug fix for releasing dcache entry on fork, and
    2. Changed the name of forks, streams, etc. to the
         new term 'tine' - hope that helps.
Don't forget the library. It actually contains one critical
(if simple) utility to enable/disable metafile handling.
