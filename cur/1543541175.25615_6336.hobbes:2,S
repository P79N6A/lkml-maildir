Hi folks,
I think i've stumbled on a old-standing bug in series 2.0.xx kernel:
I'm working on ucLinux for ARM7TDMI, which is based on 2.0.38 kernel,
booting off the FTl/MTD based flashdisk.
All works fine except that i see page cache growing and growing and never
shrinking.
After investigation i found a function "invalidate_inode_pages"  in
filemap.c which
frees pages belonging to an inode. The problem is that this function is....
never called in the kernel sources except in the loop device driver...
So the read ahead logic fills the page cache without limit
I'm thinking about adding a call to "invalidate_inode_pages" to the end of
"iput"
function in the inode.c, do you think this is correct approach?
