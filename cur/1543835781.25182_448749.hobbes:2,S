You're at a popf that can not complete.
You single-step.
The kernel sets TF.
The kernel notes the popf.
The kernel assumes that TF will be determined by the popf.
The kernel tries to run the popf.
The popf faults, leaving TF unmodified.
The kernel fails to clear TF.

I saw the comment. I don't consider that documentation.
Why even have single-step support if the debugger has to
mess with eflags manually anyway? I might as well just
exclusively use PTRACE_SYSCALL.
I think the term is "known bug".

Oh, OK, I thought they faulted. (AMD botched this)
There is a problem with instruction length though.
The buffer is 16 bytes long, but should be only 15.
The 0xf0 (lock) prefix is not valid for popf or iret.
