I was more thinking about the higher layers. Here it's simpler to setup a
list of pages which can be send to a lower layer. In the page cache we
already have per address space lists, so it would be very easy to use
that. A lower layer can generate of course anything it wants out of this,
e.g. it can generate sublists or vectors.
bye, Roman
