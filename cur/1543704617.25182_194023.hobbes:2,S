Hi all;
I just rebooted 2 days ago to 2.6.2-rc1-mm2, and I just now noticed 
that gkrellm is reporting my cpu at 680C.  Thats about 10x what its 
running at, still warm at 68C, but functional for 2 years now.  I 
didn't have this error under 2.6.1-rc2-mm4.
Any idea what patch to back out?  And where to get it?
