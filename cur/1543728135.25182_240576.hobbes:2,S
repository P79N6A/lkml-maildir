Yes, my first guess was that sched_balance_exec was changed, and I guess it 
was, but earlier than Con's patch.  The first conditional we had used to 
have:
if (this_rq()->nr_running <= 2)
                goto out;
but the 2 is now a 1 for both -rc2 and -rc2-mm2, so we tend to find the best 
cpu in the system more often now.

Actually if you have sar cpu util data, we might be able to extract this.  For 
example, if we have balance issues on 16 user sdet, we may see that very 
early on the staircase cpu util was near 100%, where the no-staircase may 
have been much lower for the first portion of the test (showing that some 
cpus were idle while others may have had more than one task).  If we can see 
this in sar, IMO that would confirm some sort of indirect load balance 
improvement in staircase.

Interesting.  I wouldn't expect it to account for up to 20% performance, but 
maybe 1-2%.
