But you see that one would need a new name as well,
otherwise the value associated with BLKSSZGET would
depend on the kernel version, and one would need
version checks anyway.
I think all this is too unimportant. Almost nobody uses
this stuff, and 2.4 is correct, and we may fix 2.2 one
of these days, perhaps for 2.2.19, and we may fix *fdisk
to correctly use it.
(By the way, have you checked that replacing get_sectorsize
by an empty routine, and specifying a -b option, works well?)
(Do you know which disks have unusual sector size?
So far I had only seen reports on a Fujitsu 640 MB.
Have you seen other sectorsizes than 512, 1024, 2048
on non-IBM disks?)
