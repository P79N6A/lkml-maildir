Hi,
I have seen that new tpm driver register lpc device with 
pci_register_driver, and does pci_disable_device on it.
This is _very_ broken as other driver share the same pci device.
For example drivers/char/watchdog/i8xx_tco.c. This one is right, as it 
only scan the lpc device via pci_find_device and don't register it. It 
also don't try to enable/disable it...
Finaly, after a quick look, they don't even need to acess the lpc as 
they don't read/write any value on it, they just do some IO on some ports.
Of course they don't care to request these IO ports with request_region...
I really wonder how such messy driver go into mainline kernel.
So for the tpm on the lpc, use pnp layer if possible or don't register 
it, and do like i8xx_tco.c. And before doing any IO use request_region...
regards,
Matthieu
