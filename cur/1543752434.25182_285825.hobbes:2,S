I'm not a big fan of hiding security fixes - having a defined and clear 
list of security issues is important. Moreover, the code itself is verbose
enough for some people. 
If you release the code earlier than the embargo date, even with "non verbose 
changelogs", to best serve the people who depend on us by giving them source 
code that is as bug-free and secure as possible, you make the issue public. 
IMO the best thing is to be very verbose about security problems - giving 
credit to the people who deserve it accordingly (not stealing the thunder
from the discovers, but rather making more visible on the changelog who
they are).
The KSO (Kernel Security Officer, the new buzzword on the block) has to 
control the embargo date and be strict about it.

Exactly, and keeping under wraps means "obscure, unclear list of security issues".
We want the other way around.
