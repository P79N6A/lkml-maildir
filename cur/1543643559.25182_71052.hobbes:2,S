   Your proposal does make sense although compute power would still be
   a player. I think the key would be parallelization;
Oh I forgot to mention that some of these cards also compute a cookie
for you on receive packets, and your meant to point the input
processing for that packet to a cpu whose number is derived from that
cookie it gives you.
Lockless per-cpu packet input queues make this sort of hard for us
to implement currently.
