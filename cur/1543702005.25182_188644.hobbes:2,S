I can't say for certain, but I think it's a tad confused - it can report 
'charging', and 'discharging', but doesn't know what to say if the battery
is at 100% and you're running off AC....It's been that way on mine at
least since 2.5.7mumble or maybe 2.4.18, so it's NOT a regression from the
recent ACPI patch.
