I actually once measured context switching performance in the scheduler,
and removing the  unlikely hint for testing RT tasks IIRC gave about 5%
performance drop.
This was on a P4 which is very different from more modern CPUs both in
terms of branch performance characteristics, and icache characteristics.
However, the P4's branch predictor is pretty good, and it should easily
be able to correctly predict the rt_task check if it has enough entries.
So I think much of the savings came from code transformation and movement.
Anyway, it is definitely worthwhile if used correctly.
Actually one thing I don't like about gcc is that I think it still emits
cmovs for likely/unlikely branches, which is silly (the gcc developers
seem to be in love with that instruction). If that goes away, then
branch hints may be even better.

Yes, gcc should be able to do pretty good heuristics, considering
the quite good numbers that cold CPU predictors can attain. However
for really performance critical code (or really "never" executed
code), then I think it is OK to have the hints and not have to rely
on gcc heuristics.

Interesting, thanks!
