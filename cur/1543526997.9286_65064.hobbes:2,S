Hello,
I have not followed l-k for some time so I don't know
what is the status of this problem - I just read about it
in kernel traffic.
FWIW, it happens also on my machine, but _only_ if
I use APM to shut the machine down. During the next
boot it locks around the time gpm is loaded - in LILO
the keyboard works, gpm says it cannot initialize
the port, in X neither keyboard nor mouse work.
100% reproducible.
Abit BP6, NJ BIOS, SMP configuration, kernel was (I think)
2.3.40, apm=smp-power-off.
Regards
