Suspend-to-ram involves stopping the system and shutting down devices to 
go into low-power mode, then on wakeup restarting devices and resuming 
operation
so the steps would be.
1. stop userspace
2. walk the system device tree and put devices to sleep
3. go into the lowest power mode available and wait for a wakeup signal
later
4. walk the system device tree and wake up devices
5. resume userspace scheduling.
note that what devices get put to sleep could be configurable, potentially 
to the extreme of things like the OLPC (that have hardware designed for 
cheap sleeping) going into a light suspend-to-ram state between keystrokes 
if nothing else has a timer event scheduled before that.
Suspend-do-disk (Hibernate) involves stopping the system, makeing a 
snapshot of ram, writing the snapshot to somewhere and powering off the 
box. on wakeup (power-on) a helper kernel boots, loads the snapshot into 
ram and jumps to the kernel in the snapshot to resume operation.
as I understand the proposal the thought is to do the following
1. system kernel does suspend-to-ram to put the devices into a known safe 
state.
2. system kernel uses kexec to start hibernate kernel
3. hibernate kernel wakes up devices it needs as if it was doing a 
resume-from-ram
4. hibernate kernel copies ram image somewhere
5. hibernate kernel shuts down the box
later
6. hibernate kernel boots
7. hibernate kernel copies ram image from somewhere
8. hibernate kernel does syspend-to-ram to put the devices into a known 
safe state.
9. hibernate kernel uses kexec to start system kernel
10. system kernel wakes up devices it needs as if it was doing a 
resume-from-ram.

this is the thought.

I don't understand the ACPI problem so I can't try to clarify it.

re-useing existing components in new ways, making it so that particular 
problems only have to be solved once and that solution is used repeatedly. 
there's a lot to like about this approach.
very cool.
