Interestingly, emacs gets that case right: when you hit enter it places the
cursor at the properly indented insertion point, but if you leave the line
without typing anything it does not leave the indentation.  I thought I
remembered vim doing the same thing, but I just tested and it appears not.  It
seems to avoid leaving subsequent lines indented, but not the first one.
