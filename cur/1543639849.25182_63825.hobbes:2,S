So add the capability to mark the child for proper exit semantics.
That's what I said: if you wan tto do this, you need to mark it at 
_create_ time. Exactly so that the proper exit semantics can be done 100% 
reliably, instead of just "sometimes". THAT is why _any_ interface that 
depends on exit_xxxx() must die - because it is inherently broken for 
accidental deaths, and does not leave the parent any way to recover 
sanely.
