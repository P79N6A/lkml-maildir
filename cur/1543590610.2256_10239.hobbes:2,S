Folks,
  I really don't know what I should do when legitimate (but malformed)
email gets bounced by some systems because their writers consider that
malformed email is a bad thing, and must not be accepted.
  We see also increasing amount of bounces by systems who think that
some 10 line linux-kernel text message is spam...
  There are two things:
      - Senders must REALLY send valid messages
      - Recipients SHOULD be more lenient on what they accept
        (And spam-detectors be smarter.  Having URLs mentioned
         in message text - maybe that was the reason - should
         not mean it is spam...)
If we ever automate recipient removal (we have means for it, more or
less), there would be no warning whatsoever when a subscriber gets
kicked out.

probably kupdate ... look for noflushd on freshmeat.net and read the
docs.
