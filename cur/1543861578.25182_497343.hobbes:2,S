The fastest and probably most important thing to add is some readahead
smarts to directories --- both to the htree and non-htree cases.  If
you're using some kind of b-tree structure, such as XFS does for
directories, preallocation doesn't help you much.  Delayed allocation
can save you if your delayed allocator knows how to structure disk
blocks so that a btree-traversal is efficient, but I'm guessing the
biggest reason why we are losing is because we don't have sufficient
readahead.  This also has the advantage that it will help without
needing to doing a backup/restore to improve layout.
Allocating some number of empty blocks when we grow the directory
would be a quick hack that I'd probably do as a 2nd priority.  It
won't help pre-existing directories, but combined with readahead
logic, should help us out greatly in the non-btree case.
