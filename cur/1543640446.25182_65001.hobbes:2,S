We're never "discarding" entropy. We're just feeling more and more
confortable in saying we've stored 'poolsize' random bits.
My point being: /dev/urandom is, by definition, for users that are fine
with 0 bits of true entropy. Why give them more?
But what you say is definitely true... on my desktop system I only need
to move the mouse a couple of times to fill the pool completely in a
matter of seconds. Once the first pool is "random enough" according
to our esteem (the entropy_count) it's ok feeding additional random data
to the second pool (used by urandom).

as usual: problems arise when the resouce is low... B-)

I see we're in disagreement, here. On the control part, I agree fully,
but it of course applies to /dev/random, too. 
I see little convenience in having /dev/urandom semantic in the kernel
(besides the fact it's already there, of course). You can easily write
an userland deamon which does the same, keeping its own pool and PRNG
algoritm, pulling bits from /dev/random at times, and only when the pool
is almost full. No inside knowledge required here (we may need a
get_random_bytes_if_count_is_over_threshold IOCTL for /dev/random, to
make things really clean). Or it can be done by a library, with
every application managing a pool of desidered size, and an algorithm
of desided crypto strengh, with the desired ratio of real random bits
in the random output (output "quality"), with optional safeguard 
tests (FIPS?) in place. It's just that I see no need to be in kernelland. 
It only requires a working /dev/random, which is definitely a kernel thing,
and a better defined API.
But I see I'm repeating myself, so we can just drop the discussion,
and peacefully live in disagreement... B-)
