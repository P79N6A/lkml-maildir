           Summary: Hang occurs at reboot
    Kernel Version: 2.5.67 and earlier versions
            Status: NEW
          Severity: low
             Owner: mbligh@aracnet.com
         Submitter: m4341@abc.se
Distribution:
RedHat 8.0+ kernel 2.5.67, RootLinux 1.3
Hardware Environment:
HP Vectra XU 2*200MHz Pentium Pro, Mitac 8575 laptop P4, 2GHz
Software Environment:
Problem Description:
The system hangs instead of shut downs or reboots during a shutdown, but all
buffers are at least flushed since the filesystems are clean at bootup, so this
is a minor annoyance. There are however some differences: On the HP Vectra it is
not always a hang, while it is always a hang on the Mitac. But the 2.4 kernel
seems to reboot (the few times I had to revert) fine on both machines. It
doesn't seem like there is any difference between reboot and shutdown.
This problem was encountered on a Mitac 8575 laptop first, and there I
considered it as a possible odd hardware case, since even Windows XP hangs
occasionally on that machine during shutdown.
Workaround: Issue a hard reset, or a powerdown/powerup.
