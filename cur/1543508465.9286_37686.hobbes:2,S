IMHO, memleak has too many ifdefs and is needed far too infrequently
to be included in the main tree.  (howto remove suggestions welcome)
It also has some interesting and undocumented features that could cause
recurring oops reports from (network) module users.  It's a nice tool,
but you have to use it carefully.  (teaching the kernel to not unload
modules which have active memory allocations would cost even more ugly
ifdefs for no real benefit)
