I'll have to give it a try next time I get a chance to reboot this server.
I only had a few nfs clients doing light load, (kde home directories, and
such) and was able to reproduce stale nfs file handles just by running "find
> /dev/null" on the nfs share.
Have you tried the -mm tree recently?  2.6.1-mm4 even has some new nfsd
patches in there (maybe you should wait until -mm5 though, there are a few
build problems and such), as well as over 20 nfs client patches.  Haven't
checked what they all do, but some of them are RPC_GSS support mixed in with
the bug fixes.
