[Note: I'm no kernel hacker]
Since de/encryption is done in kernel space, these routines eat all of
the CPU time they can get. I also don't think they are at all scheduled,
so the time that scheduler has control of, so to speak, is limted. Too
limited to call xmms thread that writes to /dev/dsp often enough.
