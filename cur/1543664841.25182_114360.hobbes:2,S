    Excuse me, I thought that you was talking about the /proc/mounts
symlink, and not /var/run/mtab. When the symlink was /var/run/mtab I
don't remeber if it was updated, but it should, because all worked
OK, I mean, all filesystems were correctly mounted. But anyway the
info provided by me is not reliable: we used the 'mount' command from
'asmutils' and I don't know how it managed /etc/mtab. All that
happened more than two years ago :(((, sorry. AFAIK, at some point of
the research, the mount command from busybox was used, too.
