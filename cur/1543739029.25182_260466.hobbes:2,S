2.4.20 is quite old; additionally, the pl2303 driver has known problems
(Oops on device removal while the device node is opened for example...).
2.6.x just works (last famous words, I know...) but I suggest you just
upgrade to 2.6.x. I'm using this driver basically each day (for GPS
receiver and a number of serial links for serial console) and never
had a problem with it (except on 2.4.x).
