Good morning,
Using FC3 or FC4 with the 2.6.9 or later kernel, we're looking for a way
to bind a thread (or an entire process) to a designated CPU.  We're
using dual processor systems as well as P4 with HT and Xeons so all of
our boxes either have two CPU's or 'appear' to have two.
I want to be able, in my C++ code to designate a specific thread to a
specific processor.  I've heard rumors that with the 2.6 kernel this is
now possible???
Thanks,
-brian
