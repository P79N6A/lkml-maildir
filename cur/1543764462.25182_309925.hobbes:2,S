What other error would you return?  I don't particularly care what exact
error code to return, but putting in Hannes patch would be a bad idea because
it
  a) poke deep into driver model internals, and we absolutely want to avoid
     that
  b) sets a bad precedence that we'll continue adding features to deprecated
     interface and thus encurage people to contiue using it.  Note that
     /proc/scsi/* has been deprecated since mid-2.5.x.
