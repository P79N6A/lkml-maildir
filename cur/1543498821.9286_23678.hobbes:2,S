i've left it intentionally at FIFO for the time being. Once all the
networking (and other) SMP improvements have stabilized i have planned to
benchmark both variants under RL load and pick the better performing one
(or FIFO if they perform equally). Both FIFO and LIFO has pros and cons. 
(my suspicion too is that LIFO will win, but i'm not taking it for
granted)
