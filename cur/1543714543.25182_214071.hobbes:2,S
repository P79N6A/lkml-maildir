Appearances can be deceptive.  Of course I care about users,
of small or large memory machines, running kde or not.
It appears that you do not understand that we're talking about a
case so rare that we've never seen it in practice, only by testing.
But perhaps we haven't looked out for it enough (no printk), I'd better
put something in to tell us when it does occur, thanks for the reminder.
If -aa consistently feels faster to you, great, go with it:
but I doubt it's because of this issue we're discussing!
