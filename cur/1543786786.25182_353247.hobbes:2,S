Mmm, this is just insane IMO.
Note that I happen to also think the idea (brsems) have merit, and
that cpucontrol may be one of the places where a sane implementation
would actually be useful... but at least when you're introducing
this kind of complexity anywhere, you *really* need to be able to
back it up with numbers.
As far as the VFS race fix goes, I guess Al or someone else will
comment on its correctness. But I think it might be nicer to first
fix it with a regular rwsem and then show some numbers to justify
its conversion to a brsem.
If you need interruptible rwsems, I almost got an implementation
working a while back, and David Howells recently said he was
interested in doing them... so that's not an impossibility.
