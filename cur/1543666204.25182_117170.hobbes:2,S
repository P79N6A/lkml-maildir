This comment seems a bit outdated..

Should be static like everything in this file (and merged into
ali15x3_probe anyway).

You're calling this from pci_driver->probe, so you will never get
here without PCI hardware.

Calling pci_find_device in ->probe looks buggy to me.  What are you
trying to do?

What about proper indentation for the comments?

I think this should be moved to linux/kernel.h as delay() - I've seen
it duplicated in so much code (including XFS)

use pr_debug() here.
