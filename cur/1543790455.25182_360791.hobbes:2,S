We should be able to call notifier_call_chain() from any context.  That
includes oops, panic, NMI and other unmaskable machine check events.
If you can call notifier_call_chain() from an unmaskable context then
it follows that the callbacks cannot take any locks.  Locks are not
safe in NMI context.
