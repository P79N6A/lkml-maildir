Hi,
I am having no luck getting my PCMCIA card to work with regular kernels
other then 2.4.19. Somehow the kernels provided by RH do work but they
don't have (recent) ACPI support so that is not an option.
I have tried various kernels from plain 2.4.20 to 2.4.21pre's and ac's
to ck versions, they all give the same message:
cs: memory probe 0x0c0000-0x0fffff: excluding 0xc0000-0xcbfff
0xe0000-0xfffff
hermes.c: 5 Apr 2002 David Gibson <hermes@gibson.dropbear.id.au>
orinoco.c 0.11b (David Gibson <hermes@gibson.dropbear.id.au> and others)
orinoco_cs.c 0.11b (David Gibson <hermes@gibson.dropbear.id.au> and
others)
orinoco_cs: RequestIRQ: Resource in use
Normally the orinoco driver gets IRQ 3 (I don't have any serial ports on
my laptop) but no luck with home compiled kernels while IRQ 3 is still
available. ACPI doesn't seem to be the problem, turning it off doesn't
help. Any solutions to this? I'd like to be able to use a more recent
kernel with ACPI support...:-(
Cheers,
Jurgen
