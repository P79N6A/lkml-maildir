   No, I think this is a problem with the broken A2 UARTs getting
confused in serial8250_set_sleep().  If I remove either UART_CAP_SLEEP
or UART_CAP_EFR from the capabilities list for this UART, it behaves
normally.  Also, just commenting out the UART_CAP_EFR chunks of
set_sleep make it behave.  I'll ping Exar for more data.  Thanks,
	Alex
