Subject: [RFC][PATCH] Replace the goto-based loop by a do-while statement
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Hi list,
It looks like using the goto statement in constructs like
restart:
	// DO SOMETHING
if (condition)
	goto restart;
should be frowned upon and the loop
do {
	// DO SOMETHING
} while (condition);
is more appropriate in such situation.
However, in the __do_softirq() routine located in `kernel/softirq.c' the goto construct was chosen in favor of the do-while loop.
The patch included below replaces the goto-based loop by the do-while statement.
If the goto is really necessary here, I would be very grateful if someone could explain why.
