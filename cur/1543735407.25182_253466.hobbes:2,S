Here's the problematic code:
        // start off by tracking down which page within this allocation
        // we're looking at. do this by searching for the physical address
        // in our page table.
        for (i = 0; i < at->num_pages; i++)
        {
            if ((address == (unsigned long) at->page_table[i].phys_addr))
            {
                unsigned long retaddr = (unsigned long) at->page_table[i].phys_addr;
                // if we've allocated via vmalloc on a highmem system, the
                // physical address may not be accessible via PAGE_OFFSET,
                // that's ok, we have a simple linear pointer already.
                if (at->flags & NV_ALLOC_TYPE_VMALLOC)
                {
                    return (void *)((unsigned char *) at->key_mapping + (i << PAGE_SHIFT) + offset);
                }
                if (retaddr <= MAXMEM)
                {
                    return __va((retaddr + offset));
                }
                // ?? this may be a contiguous allocation, fall through
                // to below? or should I just check at->flag here?
            }
        }
It gets hung up because MAXMEM is:
#define MAXMEM                        (-__PAGE_OFFSET-__VMALLOC_RESERVE)
and in arch/i386/mm/init.c we have:
unsigned int __VMALLOC_RESERVE = 128 << 20;
but alas without an EXPORT_SYMBOL() so it's not visible to modules. The old
definition was:
#define __VMALLOC_RESERVE (128 << 20)
Change was introduced with the 'tune-vmalloc-size' patch in -rc2-mm1 that added
the boot-time 'vmalloc=' parameter.
I admit not knowing the memory manager or the NVidia well enough to know what
they *should* be doing instead.....
