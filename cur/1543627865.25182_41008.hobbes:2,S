dnotify already exists, although you have to work out what has changed.
XFS implements DMAPI (Data Management API) event callouts which give
much more details.  DMAPI is designed for full blown Hierarchical
Storage Managements systems.

 to purchase the DMAPI
standard, there is also a free (with registration) online standard.
Not speaking for SGI.
