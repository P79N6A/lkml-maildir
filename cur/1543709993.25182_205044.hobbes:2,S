Hi,
There was some discussion 6 months ago about including Herbert
Poetzl's Bind Mount Extensions 
http://www.13thfloor.at/patches/
 in a
2.4.x (x = 23 at the time) kernel. Can someone please give an update?
The Bind Mount Extensions allow bind-mounting part of a rw filesystem
read-only, which is very useful to people running vservers and other
chrooted stuff.
Thanks,
Frank
