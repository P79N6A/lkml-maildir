This is a good set of questions. We have about half dozen files in 
/proc/xen right now. One is an obvious canididate to stick in /dev, as 
it has primarily an ioctl() interface. The remainder are static, are 
read-only or read-write with ascii text, and we don't want hotplug 
events and other baggage.
Maybe making these attributes of a Xen system device makes sense. Are 
there examples in the kernel of other subsystems/modules with a similar 
miscellaneous set of files?
