Subject: [PATCH] leak less memory in failure paths of alloc_rt_sched_group()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/3/2/159

In kernel/sched.c b/kernel/sched.c::alloc_rt_sched_group() we currently do 
some paired memory allocations, and if one fails we bail out without 
freeing the previous one.
If we fail inside the loop we should proably roll the whole thing back. 
This patch does not do that, it simply frees the first member of the 
paired alloc if the second fails. This is not perfect, but it's a simple 
change that will, at least, result in us leaking a little less than we 
currently do when an allocation fails.
So, not perfect, but better than what we currently have.
Please consider applying.
