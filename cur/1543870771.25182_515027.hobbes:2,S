Notice how we unhide the SMBus only on a few named machines as well.

We don't do that, never did, and never planed to do.

This is the view of someone obviously not interested in sensors. Go
tell that to all the lm-sensors users and they'll reply: "Disabling
sensors blindly would be stupid." Please realize that we're not writing
hardware monitoring drivers just for the fun of conflicting with ACPI
on some machines. We're writing them because users are asking for these
features.
