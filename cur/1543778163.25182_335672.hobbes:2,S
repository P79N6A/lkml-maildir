I don't think the name matters, as long as the RM code is simplified/unified.
that is, the only difference at first would be a change in name - 
same behavior.

some interfaces must remain (renice), and if their behavior is implemented
via CKRM, it must, by default, act as before.  other interfaces (say 
overcommit_ratio) probably don't need to remain.

users can only nice up, and that policy needs to remain, obviously.
you appear to be asking what happens when the scope of the old mechanism
conflicts with the scope determined by admin-set CKRM classes.  I'd 
say that nicing a single process should change the nice of the whole 
class that the process is in, if any.  otherwise, it acts to rip that 
process out of the class, which is probably even less 'least surprise'.

I don't see that CKRM should play by rules different from other 
kernel improvements - preserve standard/former behavior when that 
behavior is documented (certainly nice is).  in the absense of admin-set
classes, nice would behave the same. 
all CKRM is doing here is providing a broader framework to hang the tunables
on.  it should be able to express all existing tunables in scope.
