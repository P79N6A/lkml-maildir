On 64-bit platforms, sector_t (which is either u64 or unsigned long, depending
on CONFIG_LBD) is unsigned long, so there's no need for a cast. Hence there's
no compiler warning to be silenced by adding the cast.
On the other hand, adding a cast may hide bugs:
  - cast to unsigned long: When reusing parts of this code for a new 32-bit
    driver, the sector_t will be silently truncated,
  - cast to unsigned long long: When sector_t is changed to an even larger
    type, it will be silently truncated as well.
Without the cast, these would cause compiler warnings.
BTW, the resulting code didn't even compile, because of 3 bugs:
| linux-2.6/drivers/block/ps3disk.c: In function ‘ps3disk_scatter_gather’:
| linux-2.6/drivers/block/ps3disk.c:115: error: ‘bio’ undeclared (first use in this function)
| linux-2.6/drivers/block/ps3disk.c:115: error: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
| linux-2.6/drivers/block/ps3disk.c:115: error: for each function it appears in.)
| linux-2.6/drivers/block/ps3disk.c:115: error: ‘j’ undeclared (first use in this function)
| linux-2.6/drivers/block/ps3disk.c:116: error: implicit declaration of function ‘bio_kunmap_bvec’
