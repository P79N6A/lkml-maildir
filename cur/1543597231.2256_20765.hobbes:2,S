The comment is incorrect.  Take a look at the RFC for NFSv3.  There is
no duplicate request sent from the client for a JUKEBOX-supporting
server.  The first request is satisfied by the return of EJUKEBOX, after
which it is up to the client to re-request the file.  Ignoring it is not
an option because the request is terminated; a retry does not make
sense.  A new request must be initiated by the client later.
Take a look at the nfs sourceforge mailing list.  There's a long thread
about this in the context of a Solaris HSM server.  I wrote a patch to
try to do the right thing on a linux client, but it is not perfect for
many reasons:
