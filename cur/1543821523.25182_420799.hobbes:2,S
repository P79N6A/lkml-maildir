Cool, thanks for the numbers.

Yes, I guess I imagined the common case might have been slightly better,
however with reasonable RAM utilisation, fragmentation means I wouldn't
be surprised if it does easily get close to that worst theoretical case.
My request for numbers was more about the Intel/glibc people than Paolo:
I do realise it is a problem for UML. I just like to see nice numbers :)
I think UML's really neat, so I'd love to see this get in. I don't see
any fundamental sticking point, given a few iterations, and some more
discussion.
