Quoting Stephen Tweedie's earlier post to the list:

It really is broken, and sendmail triggers it (at least their
commercial binaries do).  I've already been talking to willy about the
problem. The trouble is the accounting: if one process opens a fd and then
fork()s, it is possible for the lock to be taken in the parent and
released in the child (or vice versa) --- unless there's an explicit
flock(LOCK_UN), then the lock will be released implicitly when the
last reference to the fd is closed. When this happens, we get the lock 
count incremented in one task and
decremented in another.  That can wrap the lock count backwards to -1
(or rather ~0UL), which causes the locks rlimit check to think we've
exceeded the lock quota and new lock requests will fail.  It's easy to
reproduce this: try the attached prog.  It produces an erroneous
ENOLCK due to the bug.
