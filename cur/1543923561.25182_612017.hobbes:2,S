Why always? tsc is the best possible alternative the _platform_ can
provide. So the paravirt clocksource will be at best, as good as tsc.
And if it is the case: why bother with communication mechanisms of all
kinds, calculations, etc, if we can just read the tsc?
Noting again: If the tsc does not arrive accurate to the guest, it will
fail the tsc clocksource tests. So it will be rated zero anyway
