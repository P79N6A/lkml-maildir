Blame VIA for that one.  Notice how their descriptions of the
fields in that register don't even mention a MAC.  :)
But the relevant bit is the "sleep time" and that's described
in the EHCI specification.  It basically means how long it waits,
after noticing a "no work for me" async schedule ring, before
scanning that schedule again.  It seems your system had that
set to just 1 usec, meaning it would hardly give anything else
a chance to get onto the PCI bus.  That's probably why the EHCI
spec uses a value of 10 usec:  basic fairness.
