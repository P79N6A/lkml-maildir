Not true - the outgoing SYN packet had window scale 7, when it was sent. The
SYN|ACK had window scale 0, when received by the initiating system.
Also - even if the remote were to assume a 47 byte window size, would it not
be able to send small packets? Or does the window size also include
packet haders?
