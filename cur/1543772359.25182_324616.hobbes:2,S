Well, you have to consider that this is still full Linux running. All 
the best we can do is to not make it crash or hung more than the vanilla 
kernel, it's still vulnerable to any bug of any driver :-/ In addition, 
I highly doubt this approach can ever have an implementation were the 
maximum latency is theoritically proven. The best we have is just 
measurements of the system running with high loads during very long time.

Yes, on IA64, from the hardware IRQ fireing to process scheduling (on 
x86 it's from kernel IRQ handling to process scheduling).

Well, ARTiS only modifies the schedule() function but there is probably 
too much possible interaction to really be able to prove anything (the 
fact that it's a SMP system doesn't help!).

We use a different approach: keep (small) statistics of the task doing 
often lock and the one that are more "computational". Then we migrate in 
priority the tasks that don't do locks. Your suggestion could be used 
at the same time but it might not be so efficient anymore. Additionally, 
in the current implementation, it's not so easy to know when a task 
which is running can go back to a RT CPU.

Simulation of an SMP on a UP? This sounds quite heavy but it might be 
interesting to try :-)
