Bear in mind that with the first cut of the headers_install I was trying
to keep it entirely uncontentious and stick to _mechanism_, not policy.
The _first_ set of exported headers still aren't ideal, and we're still
cleaning up some parts of them (like properly getting rid of the
_syscallX() macros, etc.). 
We've only just started to be sensible about what we export to userspace
-- it's not entirely set in stone at this point,
