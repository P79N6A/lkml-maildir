But it isn't generic.  The patch just moved the deadlock from one queue
to another.  Making work_on_cu() truly generic is quite hard!

I think we should switch acpi-cpufreq to smp_call_function(), revert
this stuff and ban the calling of work_on_cpu() under locks.

Well let's see.
- it was badly changelogged
- it was badly commented
- it's slow.  In many ways, including the unnecessary serialisation
  of each cross-cpu call in acpi-cpufreq.
- it consumes a tremendous amount of resources just to fix some
  acpi locking snafu
- it adds yet another zillion kernel threads
- it's still deadlockable
- it got sent to Linus while still under active discussion
- and it got merged
- Oleg is the usual workqueue developer and wasn't even cc'ed.
- I am the usual workqueue reviewer/merger (and would prefer to remain
  thus, please) and I wasn't cc'ed either.
