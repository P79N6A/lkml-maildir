In the past few months, I have experienced the following problem while
writing a web proxy:
Occasionally opening of TCP connection fails, ICMP work fine, not sure about
UDP though.
doing a TCP dump on the interface gives the following:
20:35:13.786654 xxx.dow.cam.ac.uk.2019 > xxx.thor.cam.ac.uk.telnet: S
2856535023:2856535023(0) win 32120 <mss 1460,sackOK,timestamp 3576074[|tcp]>
(DF)
20:35:13.788694 xxxx.thor.cam.ac.uk.telnet > xxx.dow.cam.ac.uk.2019: S
1459309405:1459309405(0) ack 2856535024 win 10136 <nop,nop,timestamp
52872733 3576074,nop,[|tcp]> (DF)
20:35:13.789067 xxx.dow.cam.ac.uk.2019 > xxxx.thor.cam.ac.uk.telnet: R
2856535024:2856535024(0) win 0
(had to split it up onto multiple lines)
The network card driver is tulip. I also have Masquerading running, and
incoming telnet works fine.
telnet's using my other interface (via-rhine) work fine, as do localhost,
just not the tulip.
Does anyone have any ideas? Is it a bug in tulip?
