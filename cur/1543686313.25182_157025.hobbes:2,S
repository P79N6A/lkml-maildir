I often noticed that using '++' and '--' within or just before assignments
and/or comparisons often break the code and make it suboptimal. C provides
enough flexibility to code what you think nearly at the instruction level.
Since 'while' loops often start with a jump to the end, you can sometimes help
the compiler by enclosing them within an 'if' statement such as below. BTW, in
your case, count ends with -1.
I've absolutely not tried this one, but it could produce different code on your
PPC, and can trivially be derived to cleaner constructs. I proceeded the same
way when I wrote my own optimized strlcpy() implementation which is 45 bytes
long and copies 1 char per CPU cycle on i686.
char *strncpy(char *dest, const char *src, size_t count)
{
   if (count) {
      char *tmp = dest;
      while (1) {
         *tmp = *src;
         if (*src) src++;
         tmp++;
         if (!count--) break;
      }
   }
   return dest;
}
Cheers,
Willy
