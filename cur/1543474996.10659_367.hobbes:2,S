Subject: Etherwork3 driver (ewrk3) broken in 2.2.0.pre-x

I have been trying to use a 2.2.0pre-x kernel on my system with a ne2k 
and a ewrk3 network card. But the ewrk3 driver does not seem to work.
The ne2k card works fine but the ewrk3 card does not respond under kernel
2.2.0pre-1 and in 2.2.0pre-2..4 the egcs compiler gives an asm problem, I
have also tried removing the egcs compiler and installing the gcc
compiler, but that did not help.
