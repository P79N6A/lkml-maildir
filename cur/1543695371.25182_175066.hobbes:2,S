I Am Not A Programmer:
Having said that, I do install and run bleeding edge Gentoo. 
gcc-3.3.1 has been rock solid for me. I've not had any of my 
kernel compiles barf on my machines for quite some time. I 
usually have the latest kernel installed and running within 2 
days of it's release. I think I'm addicted. ;-)
I use both the -O3 and -Os options depending on target machine.
