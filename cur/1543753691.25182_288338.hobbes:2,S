It's been a long while since I followed ReiserFS development closely,
*however*, this issue used to be a common problem ReiserFS - when
free space starts to drop below 10%, performace takes a big hit.  So
performance improved when space was cleared up.
I don't remember what causes this or what the status is in modern
ResierFS systems.

Anecdotally, I've found this to not be the case.  I only use ReiserFS
and have a few reasonably sized projects in Ardour that work fine:
maybe 20 tracks, with 10-15 plugins (in the whole project), and I can
do overdubs with no problems.  It may be relevant that I only have a
four track card and so load is too small.
But at least in my practice, it hasn't been a huge hinderance.
