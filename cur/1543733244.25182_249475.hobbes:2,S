I didn't test it.  It was only to show what I was thinking of with  
class_match.

The only benifit from class_match is the "object oriented approach".  I  
assume that the struct list_head children in struct class can be used from  
driver code?  It is the correct policy to use that directly than to call a  
function in class.c?  As well, the struct kobject in class_device (which we  
would use to create a symbolic link)?  And of course our driver code would  
have to acquire class->subsys.rwsem...
If we do it in lcdbase.c we can even solve the locking problem... that is,  
we can always acquire class->subsys.rwsem in the lcd class before the  
class->subsys.rwsem in fb_class.
