Hmm, in lowestpriority mode it would be possible that the APIC changes
the CPU to #1 once; but IRQ 0 is always set to fixed mode. Also even 
if that happens you should have them all on 1.
Maybe the chipset is just ignoring the IO-APIC configuration in this case?
Is it always the same chipset? Is it seen on i386 too?
The problem is really that if this happens it's more than the NMI watchdog
that is broken. If you don't run an additional APIC timer interrupt on CPU #0
it's possible that CPU #0 won't schedule at all.
The only workaround for chipsets ignoring IRQ affinity would be to keep
track on which CPU irq 0 happens and then restart APIC timer interrupts
on the others (or send IPIs) as needed. But that would be fairly ugly.
IRQ 0 is unfortunately an generally under-validated area because Windows doesn't
use it.
