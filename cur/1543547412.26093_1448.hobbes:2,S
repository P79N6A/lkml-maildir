You can't DMA directly from a file cache page unless you have a
network card that does scatter/gather DMA and surprise surprise,
80-90% of the cards on the market don't support this. Besides that you
need to do copy-on-write if you want to be able to do zero copy on
write() from user space, marking data copy on write is *expensive* on
x86 SMP boxes since you have to modify the tlb on all
processors. On top of that you have to look at the packet size, for
small packets a copy is often a lot cheaper than modifying the page
tables, even on UP systems so you need a copy/break scheme here.
As wrt your statement on latency then it's nice to see that you don't
know what you are talking about. Latency is one issue in fast
networking it's far from the only one. Latency is important for
message passing type applications however for bulk data transfers it's
less relevant since you really want deep pipelining here and properly
written applications. If you TCP window is too small even zero latency
will only buy you soo much on a really fast network.
