Actually you were right: there's no sleeping call here after doing the 
mapping. I've updated this call with kmap_atomic.
The other function that uses kmap can't be converted since we continue to map 
several pages in a loop (depending on the length of the DMA region) and hence 
can't use kmap_atomic there.
