So the purpose is different, too. With your words: spatial versus
temporal separation. They are orthogonal. In physics terms: you need
both to describe the universe and you cannot transform the one into
the other. Both make sense, they can be combined to give more benefit
(aehm, control).

Don't know how it's exactly implemented, but the restrictions should
not be at hierarchy creation time (i.e. when creating the class
(cpusets) subdirectory). They should be imposed when setting/changing
the attributes. Writing illegal values to the virtual attribute files
must simply fail. And each resource controller knows best what it
allows for and what not, this shouldn't be a task of the
infrastructure (CKRM).

Having controller specifics less hidden is good because usage becomes
more intuitive and you don't have to RTFM (controller specific manuals
would have to be written, too). One file per attribute is also nicer
than several attributes hidden in a shares files. Adding an attribute
means adding a file, it doesn't break the old interface, so this is
easier to maintain. And, as you mentioned, some files in the current
CKRM interface just don't make sense for some resources. But a sane
ruleset provided by CKRM for external controllers should be
there. For example something like:
   - Class members are added by writing to the vitual file "target".
   - Class members are listed by reading the virtual file "target" and
     the format is ...
   - Each class attribute should be controlled by one file named
     appropriately. Etc...
   - Members of a class can register a callback which will be invoked
     when following events occur:
        - the class is destroyed
	- ... ?
   - etc ...

I'd prefer a single entry point for resource management with
consistent (not necessarilly same) and easy to use user interfaces for
all resources.
