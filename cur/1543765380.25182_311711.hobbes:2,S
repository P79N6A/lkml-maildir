The thing is, most users won't have a clue about this option,
and that is a good thing. They just want stuff to work, not have
to poke random bits and pieces.

You don't need to ask the user anything (they won't know the answers anyway)
You already mentioned that E1000's cause this problem, so you have the
basis for the beginning of a blacklist.  A patch to explicitly enable
this feature in -mm for a while will probably shake out most of the
common problematic hardware pretty quickly.

So its ok for enterprise use to spew error msgs and have hardware lockups ?
See the problem with setting it either on/off ? We need to take
additional factors into consideration, or we're left with something
thats essentially useless.

A lock-up could be caused by any number of problems, and I'll put money
on even the best support guys not knowing about this option 6 months
after it got merged. Obscure toggles for esoteric features like this
get forgotten about quickly. It's more likely the support bod would
chase down other avenues before ever hitting upon this.

As someone who builds distro kernels I disagree.
End users need things to 'just work'. 99% of end-users don't know, or care
about quirks in their hardware.  If we start expecting the bulk of
them to have to go editing their grub/lilo/etc configs, we've lost.

If we have a situation where we screw a subset of users with the
config option =y and a different subset with =n, how is this improving
the situation any over what we have today ?
