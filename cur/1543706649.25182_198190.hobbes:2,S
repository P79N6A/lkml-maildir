The first thing I notice is that "make rpm" didn't work, and failed with the 
error code at the bottom of this message. Too bad, since I've been building 
RPMs on a big fast WBEL-3.0 four way Xeon, but have to run them on a humble 
PII-350. Forgive me, I do NOT want to build kernels on the test machine, it 
takes forever and needs a bit of temp space tweaking as well.
Built clean by itself, I just can't move and install it easily.
