    Several, as a matter of fact.  The one on the Compaq 386 is not
    particularly clean, but MCC lived long enough to make it onto some
    of the Yggdrasil archives.  The most recent one I have is a Winter
    1997 archive that says that it's got 1.0+ on it.
    (It's not a joke about dragging the ancient MCC setups out, either.
    This compaq 386 is being used for backwards compatability testing of
    various of my e820 patches, and I'm going to put a 2.2 (or 2.3 :-()
    kernel on it this evening so I can update the fancy e820 patch for
    testing and possible inclusion in the baseline kernel.)
