Can you try to pinpoint when it started happening more closely?
The differences between 2.6.9 and 2.6.10 are pretty big, and it would be 
much better if you can pinpoint it to a smaller range.
You can find three "release candidates" for 2.6.10 in
	
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/testing
and if you first test 2.6.10-rc2, and then depending on whether that 
already has the bug or not, you'd test 2.6.10-rc1 or 2.6.10-rc2. That 
would help pinpoint the difference to between two particular -rc kernels, 
which would be much better.
After that, I might end up still asking you to test one or two daily 
snapshots, but it may be that pinpointing when your reboot troubles 
started to just the -rc kernel might be good enough.
