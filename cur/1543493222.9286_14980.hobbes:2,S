Yes, it is SMP indeed. A UP kernel+modules works allright, using either
3c509 or eexpress. A SMP kernel fails with both. The eexpress driver is
more interesting, though, it spits out these:
eth0: tx interrupt but no status
while doing "The Double Flood Ping" and afterwards all networking is
wedged, it only says:
eth0: i82586 reset timed out, kicking   (5 times in a row)
eth0: i82586 not responding, giving up.
Then I said
# ifconfig down
# ifconfig up
and the machine locked up again. But as I said, UP kernel works pretty
well -- although it says "tx interrupt but no status" during ping -f, it
doesn't crash the machine.
