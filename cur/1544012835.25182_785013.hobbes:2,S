Sorry, I don't think this is a viable solution for anything.
This is typically the domain of soft-realtime, and as such would need a
realtime scheduling class -- using a proportional class like you did
just doesn't make sense for these tasks.
Eventually we'd hope to provide an sporadic task EDF based scheduler
with hard and soft realtime capabilities, but until that time, FIFO and
RR are the classes to use for anything realtime.
I'm not sure why you think SCHED_FIFO isn't good enough for your
applications, could you elaborate on that?
