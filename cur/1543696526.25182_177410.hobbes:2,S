our rsync isn't going to be coherency guaranteed anyways, no matter how
the updates shows up on kernel.org, rsync can't even hang on per-file
locks, sure it can't be coherent as a whole.
The best way to fix this isn't to add locking to rsync, but to add two
files inside or outside the tree, each one is a sequence number, so you
fetch file1 first, then you rsync and you fetch file2, then you compare
them. If they're the same, your rsync copy is coherent. It's the same
locking we introduced with vgettimeofday.
Ideally rsync could learn to check the sequence numbers by itself but I
don't mind a bit of scripting outside of rsync.
