No one who has read the RFC would argue that the current implementation
is wrong, what people are saying is that in many common case it just
doesn't bloody *work*!
To say that the solution for common cases is to set a bunch of flags and
run source routing is not going to make the endless discussion,
complaints, and really bad patches go away. Why are you opposed to
having a tunable to allow *easy* selection of the functionality which is
needed by many people, particularly when you have stated that such
behaviour also conforms to RFCs?
