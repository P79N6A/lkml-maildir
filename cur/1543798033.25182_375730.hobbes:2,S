Maybe they're only broken for a small subset of platforms, and someone
added a BROKEN without properly considering whether it should be global
or not?
I don't disagree with the overall notion that CONFIG_BROKEN should not
be set _where_ _possible_.  However, if it needs to be set to get the
required options, then that's what needs to happen until such time that
the above is corrected.
However - and now to the main bug bear - how can we tell what is really
broken if you _just_ change the default configuration file settings for
CONFIG_BROKEN?  What happens is that, on review, we see a simple change.
We'd assume that it has little impact, and we accept that change.
Maybe a month or two down the line, someone whines that their platform
doesn't work for some reason, and it's tracked down to this and the
resulting fallout from disabling CONFIG_BROKEN.
That means that the original review was _worthless_.  It wasn't a
review at all.
So, what I am trying to get across is the need to show the _full_ set
of changes to a default configuratoin when you disable CONFIG_BROKEN,
which is trivially producable if you run the script I've already posted.
You can even use that in conjunction with your present patch to produce
a patch which shows _exactly_ _everything_ which changes as a result of
disabling CONFIG_BROKEN.  Surely giving reviewers the _full_ story is
far better than half a story, and should be something that any change
to the kernel strives for.
If not, what's the point of the original change?
