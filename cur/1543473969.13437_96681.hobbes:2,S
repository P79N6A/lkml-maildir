Hi,
I've been using kernel 2.1.132 and it's been pretty good to me.
My project will be going to a distribution with the 2.2.0 kernel
so I'm testing the 2.2.0pre3 kernel for compatibility.
I can't seem to get my parallel port zip drive to work with
the 2.2.0pre3 kernel though.  I've added support for the parallel
port and I've added my usual stuff under SCSI controllers
(disk,tape,cdrom,generic, Adaptec aic7xxx, Iomega Parallel Port Zip and
Zip-Plus).  Did something change with the ppa driver from 2.1.132 to
2.2.0pre3 ?  Also it seems to no longer support ECP, just SPP, EPP & PS/2.
Thanks,
Tuan
