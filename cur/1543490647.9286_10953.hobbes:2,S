Could you provide a reference to support those transfer rates - the
Quantum Atlas III which looks fairly modern is specified as having
internal transfer rates between 110 and 180 Mega bits per second (see
http://www.quantum.com/products/hdd/atlas_III/specs.html
), IBM's
Ultrastar 36XP 3.5 is specified at 143.2 to 231.2 Mbits/sec (see
http://www.storage.ibm.com/hardsoft/diskdrdl/ultra/36xpdata.htm
) and
the best Seagate drives top out around 264Mb/s - these are comfortbly
less than current SCSI transfer rates of 80MB/s(= 640 Mb/s) which are
themselves are easily accomodated by a 32bit, 33MB/s PCI bus (and
Fibre channel is even faster) so I'd say the interfaces are still
faster than the physical media.
