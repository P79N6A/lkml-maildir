Everyone should assume PID's are being reused! If you have buggy apps
which assume pid's not to be reused, then just watch your proc and
reboot when you are coming to 2G-th process ;-). (Ok, there's one bug
in kernel w.r.t. pid wrapparound - in console and it allows console
user to send arbitrary signals to newly created processes.)
What is bad is that clusters pretty much need 32bit pids...

And becuase /proc internals. But please please go and change it.
