Reality check time.  Quoting Marc from the beginning of the thread:

2.4.5pre4 has drop-behind and so does -ac8.  Still, if the readahead window 
is too large then drop-behind isn't going to help a lot.
Let's test the idea that readahead is the problem.  If it is, then disabling 
readahead should make the lowlevel disk throughput match the highlevel 
throughput.  Marc, could you please try it with this patch:
