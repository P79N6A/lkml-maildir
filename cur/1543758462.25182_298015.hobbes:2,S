Sorry, I don't have time for more than the briefest look.
It appears that your old resident_mem_size method is just checking
pte_present, whereas your new smaps_pte_range method is also doing
pte_page (yet no prior check for pfn_valid: wrong) and checking
!PageReserved i.e. accessing the struct page corresponding to each
pte.  So it's not a fair comparison, your new method is accessing
many more cachelines than your old method.
Though it's correct to check pfn_valid and !PageReserved to get the
same total rss as would be reported elsewhere, I'd suggest that it's
really not worth the overhead of those struct page accesses: just
stick with the pte_present test.
Your smaps_pte_range is missing pte_unmap?
