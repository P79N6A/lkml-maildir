for such a 'k' value, we fail anyhow. For example, how does the normal
load balance detect an imbalance in this below situation?
this_load = 3W
this_load_per_task = W
max_load = 2W + 2k
busiest_load_per_task = W + k
if we really want to distribute 'N' higher priority tasks(however small or
big is the priority difference between low and high priority tasks) on to 
'N' different cpus, we will need really different approach for load 
balancing..
