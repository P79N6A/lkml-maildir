I think a good question is:
What kind of idiot wrote a program that thinks it is allowed to go
messing with the contents of /dev?  There simply can't be a good reason
for an application to do that.  Device nodes should match up with
devices, so as long as the device nodes exist for all your devices, then
everything should just work and no one should ever have a reason to go
changing things for any reason.
Perhaps the real solution is a preload library that blocks the idiotic
program from touching anything in /dev with anything other than
open/close/read/write.
Of course it could also help to simply tell people what this stupid
program is actually doing and why it should be allowed to mess in places
it doesn't belong.
