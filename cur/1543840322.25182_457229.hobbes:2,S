By that logic, you should make it necessary to set CONFIG_EMBEDDED
before you can set CONFIG_EXT3 != Y or CONFIG_IDE != Y too.
However you dress it up, it's pandering to someone who either lacks the
wit, or just can't be bothered, to _look_ at what they're doing when
they configure their kernel. And it's a bad thing.
