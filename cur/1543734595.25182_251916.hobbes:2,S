(To be able to exclude any side effect of X, I have booted without X and I 
have also removed all graphics driver related modules)
When the system freezes, the keyboard is completely dead, the LEDs do not 
react any more and also the sysrq keys do not work.

YES!! With the network cable unplugged, the system does not freeze!
Every 10 seconds, I get now the message:
r8169: eth0: PHY reset until link up
but otherwise everything seems fine.

I think the test with the network cable unplugged supports this assumption.
With network cable unplugged, /proc/interrupts shows 0 interrupts for the 
network card, so probably the first interrupt leads to the system freeze.

lspci -vx and objdump -S output (gzipped) are attached, gcc version is 3.4.2 
(Debian 3.4.2-2), but no visible difference with 3.4.1.

Thanks for your help, Francois.
I will put a few printks into the interrupt routine and hope to be able to 
tell you more tomorrow,
