	Ahh, but that's magic, and we don't want magic.  Today, you just
'magically' know that your camera card reader shows up at sda1.  We
don't want that (or at least, I hope we don't).  We want sysfs to
describe exactly what appeared (a block device with one partition), and
we want udev to give it the name our policy has asked it to (/dev/disk1
or /dev/camera1 or /dev/partition1 or whatever that policy is).  In a
udev world, I don't want to have to intrinsicly know that sda1 is where
some card reader devices appear.  Naming should be a priori, not random.
