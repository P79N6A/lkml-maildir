One more thing, I would request you to add default heuristics (number of
reclaimers), based on the number of cpus in the system. Letting people tuning it
is fine, but defaults should be related to number of cpus, nodes and zones on
the system. Zones can be reaped in parallel per node and cpus allow threads to
run in parallel. So please use that to come up with good defaults, instead of a
number like "3".
