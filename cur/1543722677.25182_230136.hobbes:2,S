If a driver needs large contiguous (e.g. a coule of MB) pages and the
memory is fragmented, it may still fail.  But it's anyway very
rare...
However, 16MB isn't enough in some cases indeed.  For example, the
following devices are often problematic:
- SB Live (emu10k1)
  This needs many single pages for WaveTable synthesis per user's
  request (up to 128MB).  It sets 31bit DMA mask (sigh...)
- ES1968
  This requires 28bit DMA mask and a single big buffer for all PCM
  streams.
Also there are other devices with <32bit DMA masks, for example, 24bit
(als4000, es1938, sonicvibes, azt3328), 28bit (ice1712, maestro3),
30bit (trident), 31bit (ali5451)...
