 Assuming you get lucky, and manage to fix up all the compile
 errors in the source you have, chances are that the same
 interface changes will break the binary only part too.
 So it'll compile, link, and likely explode as soon as you
 try to use it.
 It's likely that only nvidia can help you here.
 Same goes for any other binary only module during a devel series.
