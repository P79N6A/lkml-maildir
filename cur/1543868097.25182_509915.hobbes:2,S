Kevent interface was completely changed 4 (!) times for the last year 
after kernel developers request without any damage to its kernel part.

I only want to say that when system is designed correctly there is no
problem to change interface (yes, I again said 'to change' just because
I hope everyone understand that I'm talking about time when system is
not yet committed to the tree).
Btw, dnotify had problems in its design highlighted at inotify statrt -
mainly that watchers were not attached to inode.
It is right now the time to ask users what interface they expect from
AIO - so I asked Linus and proposed three different ones, two of them
were designed in a way that user would not even know that some
allocation/freeing was done - and as a result I got 'you suck' response
exactly the same as was returned on the first syslet release - just
_anly_ fscking _just_ because it had ugly interface.

Well, I designed kevent AIO in the similar way, but it has even more
complex one which is built on top of internal page population functions.
It is complex a bit, but it works fast. And it works with any type (if I
would not be lazy and implement bindings) of AIO.
Interface of syslets is not perfect, but it can be changed (I said it
again? I think we all understand what I mean by that already) trivially
right now (before it is included) - it is not the way to throw thing
just because it has bad interface which can be extended in a moment.

It is exactly the time to say what interface sould be good.
System is almost ready - it is time to make it looks cool for users.
