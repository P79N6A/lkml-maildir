Somehow I suspect it is getting farther and you just are not getting any feedback.

First it is not a problem that it took a long time trying to disable
the a20 line.  That just means it tried, and you have a system with
the a20 line permanently enabled.  Which by some measures is a bug,
and by others a feature.  But it does seem to be a feature of the
systems that are giving the most trouble at the moment.
The fact that kexec_test worked shows that the kexec code basically
worked, and that under the right circumstances most BIOS calls work.
Why it is hanging is currently a mystery to me.  Your system
also does not have APM support which is an interesting data point
and rules out a number of problems.

I think I need to see if kexec loads setup.S at a bad location.
Well it loads setup.S at 0x90000 which is the traditional location,
but it should not be a problem...

Have you tried booting that 2.4.18 kernel with kexec.  
Oh, wait as I recall bootimg simply copies the BIOS results
from the current kernel to the freshly booted kernel, so it skips
the BIOS calls altogether.  Which is both very handy, and trouble
some.
It may also be a device shutdown problem, as well.  memtest86
is the only candidate I can think of for testing that.  But 
My other question is does running mkelfImage-1.17 on your kernel
before you boot it help? 
ftp://ftp.lnxi.com/pub/src/mkelfImage/mkelfImage-1.17.tar.gz
It does the BIOS calls in a different order and that seems to help,
though I am still trying to track down why.
