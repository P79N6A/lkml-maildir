In lib/ext2fs/ext2_fs.h (from e2fsprogs) a default is set:
#define EXT2_ERRORS_CONTINUE		1	/* Continue execution */
#define EXT2_ERRORS_RO			2	/* Remount fs read-only */
#define EXT2_ERRORS_PANIC		3	/* Panic */
#define EXT2_ERRORS_DEFAULT		EXT2_ERRORS_CONTINUE
...which is then referenced in lib/ext2fs/initialize.c - but I agree, I 
find this dangerous myself and the first thing I do after mkfs is always 
to tune2fs to remount-ro.
