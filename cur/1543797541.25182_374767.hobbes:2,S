    Why 'excluding'? You can't deny you are using proprietary software.
    Neither do us.
The FSF chose, for its newest server, a machine that supports a
free BIOS.  You can make such choices too.
We are also trying to help the work to support free BIOS on a laptop
so that my next laptop can run a free BIOS.  There are surely ways you
can help, too, if you want to be constructive.
Non-free device firmware is also a problem, when it has to be
installed from outside the device.  The OpenBSD developers have done a
lot of work to arrange to avoid non-free device firmware.  The FSF
tries to help too; we maintain some lists of hardware which works
without non-free firmware.  We need more of these lists; if you are an
expert on some category of hardware, and you would like to help,
please write to me.
