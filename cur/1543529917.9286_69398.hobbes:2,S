The third arg should be "&st" rather than "st".  This is the address that
you're peeking, and the value in st is likely nonsense as a pointer.  See a
recent ptrace(2) for more info.
Note also that the value peeked will show up in 'err' here.  The fourth
argument is ignored in the PEEKDATA case.  This is because of the way the libc
wrapper works.
