Maybe a pointer?

With a pointer to some kind of descriptor (structure), the arch-dependent
pointer size is handled by the compiler/linker and the arch-dependent
content is handled with the arch-dependent header defining the
structure. You get to keep both pieces and they don't break when
porting to a new box.
