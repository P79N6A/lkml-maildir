Is there a way to tell what options have been applied to a currently
loaded kernel module?
I'm trying to force libata to use 1.5Gbps rather than 3Gbps, so I created
a file /etc/modprobe.d/local containing:
  options libata force=1.5Gbps
However my SATA drive gets loaded at 3Gbps.  I'm trying to figure out how
to debug this so that I can tell whether the option got correctly applied
to the libata module, and if not, how to force the SATA link to 1.5Gbps.
Any suggestions or ideas?
(I can't set libata.force=1.5Gbps as a kernel argument because on my
Fedora kernel, libata is loaded as a module rather than built into the
kernel.  I can't run "modprobe libata force=1.5Gbps" by hand because
I've got SATA drives, so the libata module is automatically loaded before
I get shell access.)
