True.
This could be fixed by adding a check at the top of dsi_file_mmap for
file->f_dentry->d_inode->i_mode & MAY_EXEC.  Of course then shared
libraries which are installed without execute permissions will cause
apps to break.  On my quick test, I couldn't run xterm or vi  :)
Note that blocking writes requires that the file be a valid ELF file,
as this is all that digsig mediates.  So I'm not sure which we worry
about more - the fact that all shared libraries have to be installed
with execute permissions (under the proposed solution), or that write
to an ELF file can be prevented by mmap(PROT_EXEC).  Presumably, if
you are replacing an ELF file, you will always want to do 
"mv foo.so foo.so.del; cp new/foo.so foo.so" anyway.
Thoughts?
