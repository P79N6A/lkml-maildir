Yeah, it won't cause any build breakage. It doesn't cause anything to
even get _built_ actually, because of the way this config option is
used directly in the .h and .c sources in drivers/net/mlx4/ (which is
itself compiled only when MLX4_CORE=y or m), and not in a Makefile.

IMHO default configs must be aimed at production usage scenarios, so
are better off without debugging enabled by default. Except if the
driver is really new / EXPERIMENTAL where the goal is to get it tested
out by all users asap (and no production systems would be using it
anyway).
Just my 2 paise,
