That took me one step further.  Now it loaded the image swap, but them
immediately rebooted.  I didn't have time to see if there were any
error messages.  I don't have a serial port, so I can't put a console
there.  This was with lots of modules loaded, so maybe unloading some
would help.  Are there any known broken drivers in this list:

In case it matters, sisfb is compiled into the kernel.
