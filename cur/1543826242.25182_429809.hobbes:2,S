When I build ACPI processor support as a module, I get this:
  MODPOST
WARNING: drivers/acpi/processor.o - Section mismatch: reference to
.init.data: from .text between 'acpi_processor_power_init' (at offset
0xfb0) and 'acpi_safe_halt'
(This is also true of -mm2, but I didn't get a chance to report it
before -mm3 was released. Before then, I built it into the kernel and
not as a module.)
and I still get this:
WARNING: "scsi_tgt_queue_command" [drivers/scsi/libsrp.ko] undefined!
