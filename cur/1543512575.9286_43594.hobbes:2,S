I had a similar problem with my BT-930 - I have a VA-503+ m/b and a K6-2 350.
The card just refused to work in that m/b when either the cpu was clocked 
over 300Mhz or the m/b was set over 66Mhz - The bios on the card would get 
corrupted (ver 2.01) and then I'd get a message just like yours. I was told
by mylex tech support that the Bt-930 was incompatible with the VIA chipset,
but I could try downgrading the bios to 1.41i. I did this and the card would
work only on a cold power on. The interesting thing is that the problem 
didn't happen with my earlier processor on the same m/b - a K6 233.
I ended up having to replace the card with one of a different type (initio
9100u) for that machine, but the bt-930 is working fine in an intel chipset
machine.
Interestingly enough I have had all sorts of problems since upgrading the
processor (mainly disk corruption, on both ide & scsi), and it's been driving
me nuts.
cheers
