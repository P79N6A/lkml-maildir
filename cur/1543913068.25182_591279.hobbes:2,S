Perhaps that is your local laws, but I'd be surprised anyway.
Do you sign contracts when shopping, or are you (and the shop)
allowed to "revoke" the transaction after it's made (I'm not
talking about shop's return policy)?
Is what you wrote only valid WRT licences?
Which country has such laws BTW?
In Poland, I can't just go and "revoke" a "statement of will"
if I haven't explicite reserved a right to do so.
Obviously I can act contrary to the statement, and be held liable.
