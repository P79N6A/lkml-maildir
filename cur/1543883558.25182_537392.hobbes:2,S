But it's not posix_fallocate; it's something more generic. glibc can
do posix_fallocate using truncate + fallocate.

How many *real* users are there for ext4?  Why does 'what ext4 does'
define 'the semantics'?
Surely semantics should be decided either by precedent (if there is an
existing relevant userbase) or sensible thought and some debate?
