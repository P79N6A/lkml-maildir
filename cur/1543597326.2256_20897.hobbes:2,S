Growing a swap file gets complex and complex where complexity is bad and 
resources are constrained due to memory pressure. 
We do need to sort this out for 2.5, for one the way that swap is 'different'
to the rest of the backing store is ugly in itself and causes a lot of
duplication and overcomplex code.
Really there should be no pages going to some anonymous magic 'swap' object.
Instead each virtual memory area should be backed by a file system object,
including a 'swapfs' - which might be the existing style of swap, might be
something stacked onto an existing fs that allocates and manages free space
or might be completely bizarre (eg a high speed SAN network swap protocol)
