They are relevant.  More parallel machines are getting more and more popular.
So far people haven't complained about Linux's scalability, most probably
since the applications they were using were scaling almost perfectly.  This
is changing.  Also there is a lower limit for optimizing the r/w path given
by the hardware.  As low as it may be - on highly parallel machines it's some
kind of wall we will run into that wall and we need to get around it.
