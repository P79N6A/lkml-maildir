Btw, if you need this short-term there might be an even simpler
solution:
  - all files go on sb->s_list and stay there until the file is freed
  - ttys grow their private list instead of beeing mixed up with the
    per-sb list
This already allows nice splitting of the locks into per-sb and per-tty
(although all tty_files accesses might be protected by tty_mutex anyway).
Especially for the superblock a rcu conversion might be quite easy
if nessecary, but all traversals are in what I'd consider more or less
slowpathes anyway.
