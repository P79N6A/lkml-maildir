Would it count if I said I run 2.4.21-rc6-ac1 and had 768MB RAM, ended
up using about 250MB swap and when I today suspended VMware and closed a
few gnome-terminals, Galeon and Evolution, the mouse cursor would not
move, then jump half way across the screen after a second, then 'stick'
again before doing another jump.
I thought it sounded a little like what you are describing. If more
details are required, let me know and I will try and collect what is
asked for.
