Well, doing it at boot is slightly ugly; I'd like s2ram to just work,
and not need boot-time-hooks. [If there's no other solution... what
can I do, but I do not like it.]

Thanks for pointer! Anyway, AFAICT the list is not really adequate. It
lists working machines, but does not really list all the switches
neccessary to get the video working. (Well, it tries in some cases,
*strange*, perhaps less switches are neccessary than I think?)

I'm afraid I don't have a time for another mailing list, and this
should not be really related to the desktop...
