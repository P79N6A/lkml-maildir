My main gripe was that I had turned *OFF* multicast on the eth 
interface, but pinging 224.0.0.1 still went out over the network and I 
got all the responses.
Currently I really want to do multicast only on the local box, and I 
don't want the packets going out over the network.  This is where the 
multicast unix sockets came from.
