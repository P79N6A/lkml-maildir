You should also have a look at the "MUA specific hints" section of 
Documentation/SubmittingPatches in the Git source distribution which 
contains additional hints.

Alpine is the successor of Pine.  Issues that were found in some earlier 
Pine versions wrt patch sending are now fixed.
Here's the relevant config options. In the "Sending Preferences" 
section:
 - "Do Not Send Flowed Text" must be enabled
 - "Strip Whitespace Before Sending" must be disabled
When composing the message, the cursor should be placed where the patch 
should appear, and then pressing CTRL-R let you specify the patch file 
to insert into the message.
