Actually, I'm confused now.  Maybe I chose a bad name to begin with.
Does it mean "I am allowed to dirty high memory" or "my high memory
will be dirty if this is on"?
Hmm... I'm even having trouble articulating what's odd about it.
I guess my internal model was: "if this flag is set then you are
allowed to make high memory dirty without needing to flush it
immediately", which is why I made it that way around.
No - you're wrong.  My patch _did_ include high memory in the dirty
memory calculations when dirty_highmem was true.

This is the total memory, _including_ high memory.

This removes the high memory from the total count.
I think I got it right.  If dirty_highmem is set to true, then
don't subtract highmem from the total memory count before
calculating the percentages.  That's what I meant, and that's
what the toggle did.  Removed the subtraction.
