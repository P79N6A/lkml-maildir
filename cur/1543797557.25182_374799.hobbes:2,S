Subject: [PATCH 10/10] Cpuset: migrate all tasks in cpuset at once
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/12/10/35

Given the mechanism in the previous patch to handle rebinding
the per-vma mempolicies of all tasks in a cpuset that changes its
memory placement, it is now easier to handle the page migration
requirements of such tasks at the same time.
The previous code didn't actually attempt to migrate the pages
of the tasks in a cpuset whose memory placement changed until
the next time each such task tried to allocate memory.  This was
undesirable, as users invoking memory page migration exected
to happen when the placement changed, not some unspecified time
later when the task needed more memory.
It is now trivial to handle the page migration at the same time
as the per-vma rebinding is done.
The routine cpuset.c:update_nodemask(), which handles changing a
cpusets memory placement ('mems') now checks for the special case
of being asked to write a placement that is the same as before.
It was harmless enough before to just recompute everything again,
even though nothing had changed.  But page migration is a heavy
weight operation - moving pages about.  So now it is worth
avoiding that if asked to move a cpuset to its current location.
