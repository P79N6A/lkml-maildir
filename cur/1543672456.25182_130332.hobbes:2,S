Hey Alan,
thanks for the comment.

I've diff'ed the 'old' driver versus the kernel driver (2.4.16, I
think), removing all formatting changes (someone ran indent over the
kernel driver. ;-)). The only obvious change was that semaphores were
added. The new driver has semaphores built-in, so that's taken care of.
Besides that, I don't think there were any real differences. If I missed
anything, please let me know. I'd like to add them to our CVS too, then.
Again, thanks!
Ronald
