Dear all,
Not sure it is a bug because of my install between potato and woody
But when I recompile kernel 2.4.9 I had to add into
linux/fs/ntfs/unistr.h: #include <linux/kernel.h>
otherwise building the kernel complains because of lack of min function
reference.
Joel
PS: Forget if already mentioned or evident corruption of my install.
