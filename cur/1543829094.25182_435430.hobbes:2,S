Store the kernel virtual pointer in gdt to access pda in (proposed)
vgetcpu in vsyscall.  Using this pointer we can easily reach the cpu and
node numbers and any other information that is there in pda.  For the
cpu and node numbers this will get rid of the need to do a serializing
operation cpuid.
Does it make any sense?

Since we are not using the limits part of the descriptor so lsl will not
be needed.  Though an indirect load from  gdt page will be made.
