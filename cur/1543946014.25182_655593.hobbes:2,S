Okay, but I can't figure out what's the problem with it. I don't have 
wireless card on my linux box also I can't test it but everything else 
works. Swap is mounted.
The concurrency cannot be a problem because the write operation is 
protected by a lock.
My only idea is the notification itself, because the netdev_state_change 
function is used which calls rtmsg_ifinfo too.
void netdev_state_change(struct net_device *dev)
{
         if (dev->flags & IFF_UP) {
                 call_netdevice_notifiers(NETDEV_CHANGE, dev);
                 rtmsg_ifinfo(RTM_NEWLINK, dev, 0);
         }
}
Also last lines of my patch could be instead of
         if (modified)
                 netdev_state_change(dev);
the following:
if (modified && dev->flags & IFF_UP) {
   call_netdevice_notifiers(NETDEV_CHANGE, dev);
}
