I guess you didn't like my reply to your first message about this?

kbuild support for modules used as libraries is really poor.  The only way
to do is use select on the library module, and then have all the
dependencies of the selectee be included in the selector, which must be
done recursively so that any modules selected by the selectee have their
dependencies added to the selector.
