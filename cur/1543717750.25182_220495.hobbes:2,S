Hi,
The following is the output of dcachebench run on the 4 kernels:
Environment - 2-way P4 Xeon 2.4MHz SMP box with 4.5GB RAM.
Tests were run for 10 iterations to calculate the milliseconds/iteration
and then mean and deviation were calculated.
Kernel version              Mean              Standard Deviation
---------------             ----              ------------------
2.6.6-rc3(baseline)         10578             221
2.6.6                       10280             110
2.6.6-bk                    10862             30
2.6.6-mm1                   10626             36
To find out if the huge performance dip between the 2.6.6
and 2.6.6-bk is because of the hash changes, I removed the hash patch
from 2.6.6-bk and applied it to 2.6.6.
2.6.6-bk with old hash      10685             34
2.6.6 with new hash         10496             125
Looks like the new hashing function has brought down the performance.
Also some code outside dcache.c and inode.c seems to have pushed down
the performance in 2.6.6-bk.
