Hello,
I seem to have problems with the ark3116 driver from 2.6.18.8. This is a 
USB-RS232 cable. Just opening the /dev/ttyUSB0 device 
gives (this is the 
debug output enabled by `modprobe ark3116 debug=1`).
The lines that look suspicious are
/serial/ark3116.c: 124 < 1 bytes [0xFFFFFFB0]
and
/serial/ark3116.c: ark3116_ioctl cmd 0x5401 not supported
I have also seen things like "id here < -62 [0x10]", which would 
indicate that usb_control_msg() returned something very negative 
(-ETIME!?).
Issuing a write() on an open fd to ttyUSB does not generate any further 
debug output. Is the driver even complete/functional?
I do not know where to go from here, please advise.
Full output:
