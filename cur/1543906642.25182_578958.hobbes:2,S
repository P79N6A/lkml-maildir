Which is why I didn't suggest doing that, of course.  The only
one making that kind of straw man argument seems to be you.

However, you've strongly implied that you want to see a short term
patch, of the type which will (as Rogan Dawes implied) prevent solving
the problem in the long term ...

Evidently you were reading someone else's message and blaming its
content on me ... since the focus of what I wrote was having a
database *OUTSIDE THE KERNEL* which would obviate the need for
any user interaction in most cases.
If I were to describe any dialog users would see, it would be more
like "I don't recognize this device, help me set it up right...".
As with music CDs, that help might update the database for the next
person.  (Assuming this were done well, of course.)

And has the discussion included the userspace people?  (I don't
know how Ubuntu or Fedora folk structure such platform-scope
tasks.  By inference, there's not enough cross-pollination...)
Speaking of which, what's this /dev/bus/usb/* crap on Ubuntu?
I had to undo all that on my Feisty system before any normal
/proc/bus/usb stuff would work again.

Unfortunately I need to run laptop off AC since its battery life is
painfully short, and since Linux behaves so incredibly rudely when
the battery power goes down to almost-zero:  it lets it go to zero
rather than hibernating.  (And doesn't automatically enter suspend
when it idles, either...)
Note by the way that if you were -- for the sake of argument -- accept
my premise that this should all be handled in userspace ... it's very
easy to make userspace code do what you want.  It doesn't need to be
done inside the kernel.
