I think it is, though.
When I build gcc/glibc toolchains, I have to use kernel headers.
I used to directly use the ones in the kernel.org tree, but
those aren't quite intended for use in userspace; fortunately,
Mariusz Mazur's sanitized kernel headers work great.
I'd like to see these patches go in to the sanitized kernel headers
and/or the kernel.org tree.  I imagine that putting them in the kernel.org
tree is right, and they'd naturally percolate from there to the
various sanitized headers projects.
