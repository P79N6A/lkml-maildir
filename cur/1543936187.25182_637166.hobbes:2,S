Hi Jon,

The old naming mechanism of i2c_client.name,driver_name is left in place and not changed for non-powerpc platforms. This patch is fully capable of dynamically loading the i2c modules. You can modprobe in the i2c-mpc driver and the i2c modules described in the device tree will be automatically loaded. Modules also work if compiled in.

I2C device names are picked up from the device tree. Module aliasing is used to translate from device tree names into to linux kernel names. Several i2c drivers are updated to use the new aliasing. 
Now that I have read all the previous versions of this patch series
and, more importantly, all objections that were raised on the way, I
can start reviewing the latest iteration of your patches. I'll also do
some testing, although I have no powerpc stuff here, but at least I
want to make sure that there are no regressions introduced by your
patches on x86.
