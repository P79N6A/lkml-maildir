After this change, all archs need to provide struct_cpy() to make AFS compile,
while currently only ia32 and amd64 provide it.
Since its implementation is quite generic, perhaps it can be moved/added to

In personal conversations with technical people, I call myself a hacker. But
when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
