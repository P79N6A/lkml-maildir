yes, it will work just the way you'd expect it to work: the counter is 
attached to the fd of the monitoring task, so it does not go away. The 
counter simply stops counting but otherwise can be read even after the 
monitored task has exited.
We are also planning a natural 'the task has died' notification: a -EPIPE 
returned by read(), after the final count has been allowed to be read 
out. With blocking counters this will behave quite smoothly: instead of 
blocking indefinitely, we'd get back -EPIPE. Hm?
