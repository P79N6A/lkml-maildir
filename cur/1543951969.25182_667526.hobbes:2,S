That decision has already been made for us.
BM_STS has been made a no-op on recent processors.
It reports bus activity only for a small sub-set of
south-bridge devices.  Otherwise it tells us there
is none and that we should proceed into C3.

The newer the processor, the less exposed we area to this scenario.
