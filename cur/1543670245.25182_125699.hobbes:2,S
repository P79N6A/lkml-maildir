   Well are we sure that the `flags' and `count' fields will always fall into
   the same 256-byte range?  Wouldn't it subtly break if sizeof(struct page)
   became not a multiple of eight?  Will the compiler pad it out anyway?
As long as there is a long or pointer member, the structure
will be required to be 8 byte or better aligned.
