One raw socket is used to send packets to several interfaces. If only 
one of them is down, socket will be blocked as well.
Related problem is that we have no way to detect if vlan interface 
goes down. Wouldn't be correct behavior to remove IFF_RUNNING from 
all vlan interfaces bound to ethernet interface if this ethernet 
interface goes down? There might be similar problems with other 
network interfaces.
