This didn't work.
Something weird is happening here... It seems that "menuconfig I2C" is not
working properly, or maybe I'm blind ;)
I'm trying to generate the patch for fixing this issue. However, every time I
add a dependency for I2C, I got wrong results:
make oldconfig >/dev/null; grep CONFIG_VIDEO_DEV .config; grep CONFIG_I2C= .config; grep CONFIG_VIDEO_V4L2_COMMON .config
CONFIG_VIDEO_DEV=y
CONFIG_I2C=m
CONFIG_VIDEO_V4L2_COMMON=y
---
Trying to isolate the problem, I'm applying this patch to define
CONFIG_VIDEO_V4L2_COMMON:
diff --git a/drivers/media/Kconfig b/drivers/media/Kconfig
index 8f4a453..20a5d26 100644

Shouldn't VIDEO_V4L2_COMMON be equal to 'm', due to I2C dependency?
Cheers,
