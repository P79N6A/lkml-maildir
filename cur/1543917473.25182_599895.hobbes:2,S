Are you disagreeing with the numbers Ingo posted? 25,000 false
positives for the kernel is beyond silly... Existing conventions
should matter a lot and the default configuration for a static code
checker should really be 100%. So why not hide the potentially useful
warnings under -Wtoo-strict or similar command line option?
