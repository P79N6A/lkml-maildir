Yes, I kindly apologise for this crime.

Thanks for providing this information.
I assume in this case the condvar is PSHARED, while mutex could be/is PRIVATE ?
I wonder how old (assuming all shared) code could work, since the notifier 
would call FUTEX_CMP_REQUEUE giving a target address outside of this process vm ?
My understanding (probably bad, since I know nothing about POSIX as you mentioned)
- Old code could not use FUTEX_CMP_REQUEUE if mutex was private.
-> Old code was using a normal FUTEX_WAKE in this case.
So I repeat my question : Should we really add yer another futex command in 
kernel for a corner case ?
Thanks
