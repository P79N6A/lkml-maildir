And almost certainly wrong.
The *point* of request_region() is that you do it before any I/O to
the region.
So you can't release it before calling AscGetChipVersion().
Converting this driver is quite a bit of work, since you have to trace
down every path which uses the region and make sure it's covered.  The
fact that it's formatted like an angry haiku doesn't help.
Rusty.
