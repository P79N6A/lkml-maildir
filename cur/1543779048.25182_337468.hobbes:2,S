I tried building the 2.6..13-rc4 kernel by applying the 2.6..13-rc4
patch to 2.6.12 kernel source. The build goes fine but booting to the
new kernel fails giving the following errors 
Insmod error inserting /lib/sd_mod.ko' :-1 Unknown symbol in module
Error: /bin/insmod exited abnormally!
I am getting the same errors for mptscsih.ko , ext3.ko and dm-mirror.ko
modules. 
Not sure if this is a known issue...
Thanks
Abhay
