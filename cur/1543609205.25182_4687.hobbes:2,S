2.4.14 + VMWare 1455 froze on my laptop the other day, hard hang, no
 keyboard, had to keep poweroff pressed for several seconds to shut
 the box down. Ext3 though minimized quite nicely startup time :)
I can't now try to go much further - I zapped the original NT install
 I didn't perform properly but my PageUp/PageDown keys aren't working
 anymore (hardware bug, sigh) and I can't scroll past the NT EULA as
 it wants PageDown :( Next week I'm getting the keyboard fixed, so I
 will resume testing.
The full installation though in the various attempts I performed went
 through twice whilst I had only 1 freeze.
This is a Dell Latitude CPx750J, 256MB RAM, 20GB IBM disk, Xircom
 RBEM56G100TX network card.
