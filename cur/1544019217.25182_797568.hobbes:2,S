Subject: [PATCH 1/2] fix shmctl(SHM_INFO) lockup with !CONFIG_SHMEM
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2009/1/27/365

shm_get_stat() assumes that the inode is a "struct
shmem_inode_info", which is incorrect for !CONFIG_SHMEM (see
fs/ramfs/inode.c::ramfs_get_inode() vs. mm/shmem.c::shmem_get_inode()).
This bad assumption can cause shmctl(SHM_INFO) to lockup when
shm_get_stat() tries to spin_lock(&info->lock).  Users of !CONFIG_SHMEM
may encounter this lockup simply by invoking the 'ipcs' command.
