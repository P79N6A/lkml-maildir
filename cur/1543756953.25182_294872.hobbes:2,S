Changes that change no code (u32 -> pm_message_t) are okay with me;
anything changing code (.event) has to wait after 2.6.11.
Andrew, if you get one big patch doing only type-safety (u32 ->
pm_message_t, no code changes), would you still take it this late? I
promise it is not going to break anything... It would help merge after
2.6.11 quite a lot...
