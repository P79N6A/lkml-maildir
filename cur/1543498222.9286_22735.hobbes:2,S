I didn't mean to suggest that devfs was difficult to use -- I've never
tried -- but there's clearly a polarisation of opinion which is going
to stop it from becoming a standard part of the kernel in the very
near future.
I think what's important is that the problem of device numbers can be
worked around (if not solved) in user space. And the solution works
_right now_ on any modern kernel.
Cheers,
Matt
