1. CPU too hot, get a better fan and use heatsink compound between
heatsink and chip.
2. Overclocked CPU. Put it back where it belongs.
3. Overmarked CPU. CPU that has been modified to make it APPEAR to be a
faster model and is running overclocked but you are not aware of it.
4. A bad memory location.
5. Bad power supply.
Does it fail in exactly the same place and in the same manner every time?
