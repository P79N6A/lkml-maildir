Yes, fine.

0x5b is 91 which is x86_keycodes[101].
Yes, so all is clear:
The 2.6 kernel no longer has a raw mode - it has a simulated raw mode
that is not very raw. When you updated the table used for the
scancode->keycode translation, the table used to reconstruct what
might have been the original scancode was not changed accordingly.
Thus, showkeys -s gave a garbage answer.
Thanks for the report. It shows that resurrecting raw mode is even
more desirable than I thought at first.
