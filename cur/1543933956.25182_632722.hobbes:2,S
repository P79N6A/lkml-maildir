I am running kernel 2.6.23.9
last night I had a crash.
This was all that was in the /var/log/messages.
I run centos 5.1 with the above kernel.
This was late at night noone was using the machine.
The machine is an AMD 6400+ X2, NVIDIA (with nvidia drivers). Software 
RAID with 2 seagate 500GIG drives as raid-1.
Any know issues with this?
