Very good to see progress in this field. I'm not familiar with the 
technical details yet, but this seems an important security feature imho.
How does this patch relate to the one at
http://www.olafdietsche.de/linux/capability
 ?
I do think the LD_PRELOAD / LD_LIBRARY_PATH problem (also described by
Olaf) should be mentioned in the kernel config, and fs capabilities should 
remain marked EXPERIMENTAL until that's resolved.
Kind regards,
