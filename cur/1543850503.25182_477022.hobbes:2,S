Yes, but even putting that problem aside, the timing element here is 
tricky to get right in a VM.

No.  You can use a real timer just fine.  But there is no reason ever to 
use udelay to busy wait for "hardware" in a virtual machine.  Drivers 
which are used for real hardware may turn udelay back on selectively; 
but this is another patch.

Really?  I didn't see one that disabled the broken motherboard detection 
/ workaround code, which is what we are trying to avoid here.

That is what this patch is building towards, but the boot option is 
"free", so why not?  In the meantime, it helps non-paravirt kernels 
booted in a VM.
