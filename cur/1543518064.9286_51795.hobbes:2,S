Only BUG() won't help the latency. And it seems not a problem.
Why do you want to forbid people to enable_bh with irq disabled? there's
nothing bad in doing so. You must _not_ run the bh handlers if you can't
reenable irqs, but you _can_ reenable the bhs (for example for other cpus)
even if you have irq disabled.
