The looks like a Core Duo. If that is really the case,
then commit e82f64e5bb0648a13630d752c35be1e7bd8bab96 from Bjorn
should fix your problem. I have it is my 2.6.23-rc3 tree.

Yet the model name looks strange. So we need to run one more test,
as the fam/model is not enough. What we need to check is whether or
not this processor implements architectural perfmon or not.
Could you please compile and run the attached program and send me 
the output?
Thanks.
