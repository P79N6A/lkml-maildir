OK. An updated patch will follow in a few days, as Alan requested not
sending new patches for some days.

Sure. I'm actually using it in production, and other people also
reported that it works well without any problems.

No. The whole point of the patch is that you /don't/ have to change
the MTU on the physical interface for VLAN support.
Though with the registers I figured from the specs it will be only a
matter of a few lines to add a dev->change_mtu to the driver. I can
add it to the patch if someone wants it.
Another question, how do you feel about the #ifdefs in the patch? As
said before, always enabling will not pose any performance penalties
to those not using VLAN tagging, so I could equally well just remove
them if noone objects.
