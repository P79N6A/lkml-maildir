Subject: [PATCH] make c_idle.work have a static address.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Currently, c_idle is declared in the stack, and thus, have no static address.
Peter Zijlstra points out this simple solution, in which c_idle.work
is initializated separatedly. Note that the INIT_WORK macro has a static
declaration of a key inside.
