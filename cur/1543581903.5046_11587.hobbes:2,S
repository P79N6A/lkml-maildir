I think that's worth another "ewww...", don't you?

That was intentional - dhinds suggested that if the hardware
isn't present the driver should float about in memory anyway.
That is the current behaviour of 3c575_cb.c  I forget the
rationale for this.  Perhaps David can remind me?
There are a fair few pending 3c59x updates wrt Linus'
tree - small stuff.  Most are in the zerocopy patch,
and there's a delta on top of that here.

I guess so.  Testing is hard - EISA vorticies are hen's teeth.  I've
heard from only two people who have such hardware in a year.
I've made the below change.  Pending enlightenment from
DavidH and some testing from my sole EISA Vortex person,
I'll flush this stuff out to DavidM.  Thanks.
