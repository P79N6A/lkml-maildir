rpm -i util-linux-xxx.src.rpm
and count the patches yourself. Andries could be the Pope I would
still feel free to tell him what I think about this.
Ahh and just a remainder - poking at ports in kbdrate is bad and not
quite something I would learn from.

I don't use and don't care about devfs - it's a misconception in my opinnion.
What you are potining at is just another symptom of this simple fact.
After several years of beeing "official" it didn't develer up on
promises. There are some reasons why the Linux vendors out there get
well along without it. It is simple not necessary and even worser
introduces more problems that it promised to solve. No matter how
vigorous the propnents of it where before Linus give in. It's just another
try to work around the too narrow major/minor number spaces of Linux
and well see below:

All what you are talking about here are afterthoughts to the a basic simple
flaw in the linux way af looking at devices:
Major numbers are sliced up to account for the fact that some drivers
abused slices of the major number space instead of minor numbers to
discriminate between different instances of the driver. Even worser
some drivers (most prominently ide-cd) hooked up completely
different devices on the same mojor number.
And last but not least: some devices which should be viewd as "same type"
are hooked up to different major numbers instead of sharing them.
Most prominent here are the differences between SCSI disks and ATA disks
for example. From a technical point of view they don't make *any* sense.
