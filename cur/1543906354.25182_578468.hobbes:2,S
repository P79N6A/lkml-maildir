We have to do so frequently. New hardware often exposes bugs in the 
kernel.

The policy has been to attempt to be bug-compatible with Windows 
whenever possible for some time now.

Given that many vendors still only test against Windows, that's exactly 
what we need to do.

No, that's not the only reason for notifications. Alteration in hardware 
state may also force a recalculation of trip point (adding a battery to 
a bay rather than a DVD drive may require the platform to be kept at a 
lower temperature)

Surely people want this functionality so that they can raise trip 
points?
