With a dual-processor A7M266-D MB (two AMD XP-MP 1900+), enabling 
CONFIG_AMD_PM768 causes the machine to hang on boot.
I don't think this is a major concern for the release because the 
description of this parameter includes EXPERIMENTAL (although it is not 
flagged to be selectable on when experimental options are enabled).
A few details:  The kernel is booted with noapic (has always hung 
otherwise).  It hangs right after listing the drives and ide interfaces, 
and right before it prints out the geometry of the first drive.  This is 
the output prior to hanging:

<HANG>
(I'm extracting this output from a working 2.4.20-rc3 compiled without 
AMD_PM768.  The output is the same except that the last line says queue 
c03941e4 instead of the value above.)
The next line should have been:
hda: 241254720 sectors (123522 MB) w/1863KiB Cache, CHS=239340/16/63, 
UDMA(100)
ide0 is a
AMD7441: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev 39
AMD7441: chipset revision 4
AMD7441: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later
AMD7441: disabling single-word DMA support (revision < C4)
    ide0: BM-DMA at 0xb800-0xb807, BIOS settings: hda:DMA, hdb:pio
    ide1: BM-DMA at 0xb808-0xb80f, BIOS settings: hdc:DMA, hdd:pio
I'll be happy to help if someone needs more debugging information.
