I thought it is already here.  That is, if the kernel have something
to send at the moment when incoming packet arrives, it sends one
packet out, containing both the ACK for previously received packet
and the data.
Ie, if the app is sending data in both directions, there will be no
(well, almost: initial handshake and final sequence are still unique)
"bare" ACKs, or packets without data.
Or Am I just dreaming? ;)
