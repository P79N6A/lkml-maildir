Its not specifically IBM, there are two sets of things to watch out for
-	Cache flush as a nop/unimplemented. This is legal in all but the
	most recent ATA specification. The spec has been tightened so that
	problem will go in time
-	Some IBM laptop drives appeared to fail to write back the cache on
	machine shutdown/suspend etc. The exact rights/wrongs/details on
	that one haven't been pinned down because the folks concerned
	swapped a couple of drives for different ones, saw the problem
	vanish and being a large organisation had the supplier replace the
	other fifty odd.
