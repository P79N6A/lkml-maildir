O= builds are broken, with the following error:
fatal error: opening dependency file
scripts/kconfig/lxdialog/.checklist.o.d: No such file or directory
git-lxdialog.patch appears to be the offender.  Backing it out fixes
this problem.  It's a large patch, so I didn't try to pull it apart to
figure out where exactly the problem was.
