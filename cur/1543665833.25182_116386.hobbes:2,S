I did take a look at your stuff in the past ... had a few minor objections
at the time, but have actually grown closer to what you do since then.
I *do* like the numbering of my patches though. I might try to merge them
together at some point soon.
So when I say 1 hour ... bear in mind I don't take Linus bk-drops normally,
on the full releases, so the delta is bigger (and I'm slower than you! ;-))
You still have to fix up the rejects from 'patch -p1' by hand though,
right? That's what normally takes most of the time, especially if it's
code I'm unfamiliar with, or I make a mistake (reboot takes 5-10 mins ;-))
