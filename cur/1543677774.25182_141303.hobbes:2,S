ftape, too.  The LATCH() macro should also be moved to such a header
file, I think.  How about just creating asm/pit.h?  Only platforms
that need to (potentially) support legacy hardware would need to
define it.  E.g., on ia64, we could do:
 #ifndef _ASM_IA64_PIT_H
 #define _ASM_IA64_PIT_H
 #include <linux/config.h>
 #ifdef CONFIG_LEGACY_HW
 # define PIT_FREQ	1193182
 # define LATCH		((CLOCK_TICK_RATE + HZ/2) / HZ)
 #endif
 #endif /* _ASM_IA64_PIT_H */
This way, machines that support legacy hardware can define
CONFIG_LEGACY_HW and on others, the macro can be left undefined, so
that any attempt to compile drivers requiring legacy hw would fail to
compile upfront (much better than accessing random ports!).
