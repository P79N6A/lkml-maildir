Subject: I get the following errors on my machine

   I have a AMD k6-2 333MHz, w/ 64MB SDRAM, a Flasgpoint TX Lite mobo, a
Symbios 53c815 PCI SCSI card. Connected to the IDE connectors on the mobo
are a Quantum FireBall 4.3SE UDMA33 HD (primary master), a WDC1270
(270MB) DMA16 (primary slave), a Goldstar GDC-R540B (4x CD-ROM, secondary
master), a Iomega ZIP100 ATAPI (secondary slave) and a Plextor PX-32TSi
(32x CD-ROM, SCSI, only SCSI device at 0:0:0). I get the following errors
at startup:
sym53x8xx: at PCI bus 0, device 20, function 0
sym53c8xx: not initializing, device not supported
ncr53c8xx: at PCI bus 0, device 20, function 0
ncr53c8xx: 53c815 detected
   After this the SCSI bus is reset and system works normally...
   When I try to access the ATAPI CD-ROM for the first time I get the
following message:
hdc: disabled DSC seek overlap
   but then the system works normally again.
   Another thing. I am getting DMA errors on my Quantum, and running
badblocks indicated that I am getting bad sectors on my HD. Can this be
caused by bugs in the IDE driver or my HS really going bad?
