The main problem with "mediating by file names" in Linux these days is
(as I'm sure you know) the whole fun of binds, namespaces and other
lovely things that people do with filesystems (see the fun that
ClearCase does with bind mounts on the latest 2.6 kernel for an example
of the nightmare that "file names" will cause.)
Yes, users are used to filenames, but fortunatly they don't matter to
the kernel.

LSM doesn't care about filenames, but inodes.  So you both are not
disagreeing :)
