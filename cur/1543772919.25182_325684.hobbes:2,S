I meant that they don't use utf-8 but it is still the unicode. I am not
sure i've made myself clear.

Yes. I also think UTF-8 is a good idea, however it is not an ideal one.
It *preferes* Roman encodings since some Asian characters need even four
bytes.
IMHO for *every* filesystem there need to be an *option* to:
1. store filenames in utf-8 (that is quite possible today) or any other
unicode form.
2. convert them to/from a desired iocharset. I prefere using ISO-8859-2
on my system for not every tool support utf-8 today (hopefuly yet).
Of course if a user whishes to store filenames in some other encoding
she should be *able* to do so (that is why i like linux).
Generally. IMHO VFAT is a good example how character encoding needs to
be handeled.
Best regards.
