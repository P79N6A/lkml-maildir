Thus far, I've managed to lock up my machine 3 times under 2.3.15 SMP. Each
time has seemed to be during network activity, unfortunately, as I've been
in X every time I've triggered it, I haven't been able to catch the oops
to decode it.  When it happens, the kernel is still alive, as sysrq allows
me to reboot, but pinging the machine gets no response.
Behavior not exhibited in 2.3.15-pre1; didn't try any of the later
pre-patches.
Any ideas?
Jeremy
