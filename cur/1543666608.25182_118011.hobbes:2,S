yes, this is very helpful thanks ;). I'd suggest you to also parse the
logic tag and to print a warning if there's an error and not only to
trust the timestamps. In general I don't love to depend on timestamps,
so I appreciate the availability of the logical tag in the cvs log.
Infact it would be nice to also be able to ask for the extraction of a
certain logic tag out of the tree. This logic tag will be the
"changeset" number for us, but one that is also persistent and no only
unique (unlike in bk where the changeset number of a changeset can
change anytime AFIK)
I also wonder if it wouldn't be better if Larry would simply tag the CVS
with the logic tag number since the first place, rather than writing it
in the logs and having to parse the stuff with an external utility. 
Personally I would prefer the logical tag to be applied to the CVS with
a true `cvs tag`, not only written into the logs. dozen thousand of tags
(i.e. changesets) shouldn't be a problem for cvs. Doing this change
should be trivial, it should be easier than embedding the logical tag in
the cvs comments. what do you think?
