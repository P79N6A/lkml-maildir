What the hell is this supposed to be? How am I not to take this:
"i did not want to embarrass you (and distract the discussion) with
answering a pretty stupid, irrelevant question"
as an insult? How does it reflect on someone if he asks "stupid, 
irrelevant questions"? If it had been a misunderstanding, you could have 
ask appropriately instead of assuming I'm an idiot.
BTW Adding smileys to it doesn't make it any funnier, since it I don't 
believe in the "misunderstandings" theory anymore. :-(
bye, Roman
