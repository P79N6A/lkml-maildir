I'd suggest reading a linux-kernel or an archive site, and pulling Al Viro's
2nd patch for 2.4.15 inode.c problems.
2.4.15 has the potential to corrupt your filesystems slightly on reboot.
Al provides a safe method to reboot without this corruption, but it will
still be a good idea to force a fsck on boot, using:
	shutdown -F -r now
