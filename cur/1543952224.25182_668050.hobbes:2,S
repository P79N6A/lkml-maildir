gcc (at least version >= 4.1.2) seems to smarter than that. It
doesn't seem to put data initialized to zero in the initialized data
segment but rather adds it to the uninitialized data. That said,
initializing statically allocated data to zero is superfluous in C
and should be avoided for style/elegance reasons as well.
