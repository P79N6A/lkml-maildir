I just tried a small test program to see the speed/code size difference 
to this code, which is the arithmetic equivalent:
   pb = prop0 / (9 * 5);
   prop0 %= (9 * 5);
   lp = prop0 / 9;
   prop0 %= 9;
This code runs a lot faster than the original. This is not very 
important since it runs only once AFAICT.
As for the code size, it is smaller if compiled with -Os, but larger 
when compiled with -O2 or -O3.
When compiled with -Os, gcc uses the idiv instruction and it even uses 
its reminder so that it only does 2 idiv instructions to do the 4 
operations above.
With -O2 or -O3, it does a hard to follow division "by hand" using 
several instructions, rendering the code about 2.5x larger (but 
amazingly a lot faster).
The tests were done with gcc 3.3.2.
