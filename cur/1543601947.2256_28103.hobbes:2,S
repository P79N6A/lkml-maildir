Subject: Reiserfs does not work from fstab in 2.4.9-ac12

I just got caught by this on a box which had a reiserfs /usr partition...
# mount /disk2
reiserfs: kgetopt: there is not option
<lots of mount failure stuff>
The fstab that generated this (which has worked for every other version,
so I believe it to be correct):
/dev/hdb1      /disk2          reiserfs        defaults        0       0
However
# mount -t reiserfs /dev/hdb1 /disk2
..works correctly.
