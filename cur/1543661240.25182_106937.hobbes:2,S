Hi,
I have a problem getting agpgart/drm to work on my TiBook, I have
tracked the problem down to that suspect looking message.
agpgart: AGP aperture is 16MB @ 0x00
[drm] AGP 0.99 on Unkiwn @ 0x00000000 16MB
which results in the following messages in my XFree86 logs:
[agp] ring handle = 0x0000000
[agp] Could not map ring
Its an ATI Radeon 7500 Mobility M7 on an Apple UniNorth 1.5 chipset.
I think the correct aperture base is one of:
AGP special page: 0xdffff000
aper_base: b8000000 MC_FB_LOC to: bbffb800, MC_AGP_LOC to: ffffc000
