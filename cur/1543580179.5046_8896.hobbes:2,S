It used to be basically meaningful, for systems that had to swap, instead
of page.  In those cases, in order to be assured of getting any use out of
the system, it had to be at least twice the amount of RAM needed.  Of
course, you could have twice as much swap as RAM, four times, eight
times... but twice was the usual amount.
It's pretty well useless now though, even on Solaris :}
