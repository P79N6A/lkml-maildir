Perhaps you meanwhile saw the similar question from Keir regarding this
(and my answer), but in short: plain glibc 2.3.2 (at least) supports AT_SYSINFO
but not AT_SYSINFO_HDR. In this scenario, moving the vDSO around is fine,
but glibc-internal (arguably broken) consistency checks prevent the vDSO from
being accepted when not using COMPAT_VDSO.
