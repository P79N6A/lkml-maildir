I have dumped this set of patches into OSDL's patch system.  The builds
are still pending, but it should be possible in awhile to run tests with
this patch stack in the automated test environment at OSDL.
The patch stack:
1st patch:
http://www.osdl.org/cgi-bin/plm?module=patch_info&patch_id=1706
2nd patch:
http://www.osdl.org/cgi-bin/plm?module=patch_info&patch_id=1707
3rd patch:
http://www.osdl.org/cgi-bin/plm?module=patch_info&patch_id=1708
4th patch to flip the switch:
http://www.osdl.org/cgi-bin/plm?module=patch_info&patch_id=1709
Regards,
Andy
