Linus, please pull the latest scheduler git tree from:
   git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/mingo/linux-2.6-sched.git
It includes six fixes: an s390 task-accounting fix from Christian 
Borntraeger, sysctl directory permission fixes from Eric W. Biederman, 
an SMT/MC balancing fix from Suresh Siddha (we under-balanced) and 
another fix from Suresh for debugging tweak side-effect. Plus there's a 
sched_clock() quality fix for CPUs that stop the TSC in idle (acked by 
Len Brown) and a reniced-tasks fixlet.
the SMT/MC blancing fix has the highest risk - but since it causes 
slightly more balancing (instead of less balancing, which is the more 
risky action) it should be pretty safe. Key workloads still seem fine. 
Tested on 32-bit and 64-bit x86 and it has passed 200+ make randconfig 
build tests.
	Ingo
