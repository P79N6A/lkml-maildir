Martin et al:
Here is a litle bit more information:
2.6.7-mjb1 w/4G split enabled:
44.91user 56.95system 1:46.30elapsed 95%CPU
(0avgtext+0avgdata 0maxresident)k
0inputs+0outputs (0major+6907875minor)pagefaults
0swaps
2.6.7-mjb1 w/4G disabled enabled:
30.71user 34.56system 1:11.29elapsed 91%CPU
(0avgtext+0avgdata 0maxresident)k
0inputs+0outputs (21major+6907525minor)pagefaults

Clearly something is wrong.  This is making headers
which does a lot of spawning of bash shells and ln -s
different files and some minor dependancy makes.
Any help understanding what is happending here would
be greatly appreciated!
Thanks!
