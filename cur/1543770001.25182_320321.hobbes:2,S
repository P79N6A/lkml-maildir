The recent prolifation of might_sleep() points was a direct result of 
the -VP patch. I _did_ measure and lay out the might_sleep()s so that 
key latency paths get cut. If we did what you propose we'd end up
duplicating 95% of the current might_sleep() invocations. So instead of
sprinking the source with cond_resched()s, we implicitly get them via
might_sleep().
there's another argument as well: if a function truly might sleep, it's 
in most cases complex enough to not worry about one extra need_resched() 
check. So might_sleep() and cond_resched() pair better than one would 
think.
(it is also a debugging helper: by actually sleeping at might_sleep() 
points we truly explore whether preemption at that point is safe.)
or if you think we can get away with using just a couple of 
cond_resched()s then you are my guest to prove me wrong: take the -RT 
kernel it has both -VP and the latency measurement tools integrated, and 
remove the cond_resched() from might_sleep() and try to find the points 
that are necessary to cut down latencies so that they fall into the 
1msec range on typical hw.
