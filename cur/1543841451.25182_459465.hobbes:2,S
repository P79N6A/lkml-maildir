I've been casually working on adding SDIO support to the MMC layer. The
driver model needs quite a bit of changes, so it's a bit of work before
we have something working. So far I've only got the basic init up and
running.
The current version of the patch included (ignore the failed chunks for
mmc_block.c). Feel free to test away. :)

This is a SD "feature" and not specific to SDIO, so we have code for
this already.

SD mandates a star topology (just a single card per bus), so we'll just
force a single card into the list. SD memory cards can actually work on
a shared bus, SDIO can not. It's not a big problem in practice though.

I've started implementing some SDIO equivalents of readX/writeX.

The driver model isn't designed for SDIO cards, so it needs to be
changed. The design I'm working on couples "functions" to each card,
where drivers will bind to these functions instead of the card. Search
the archives for "MMC driver model" and you should find my LKML post
about it.

It shouldn't be different from PCI, USB or any other bus.

We need controller help to do interrupts. It's on my todo-list as it
requires a bit more indirection than "normal" interrupts.

The basic model changes should come first as they will dictate on how
the rest of the code must be organised. I'd love to see your code though.

SDIO is actually easier as there is a spec for at least the protocol and
Bluetooth cards.
