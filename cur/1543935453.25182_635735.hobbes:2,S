Linux is too much like Windows, and that's a big part of the problem. 
People are obssessed on providing WIMPshit interfaces to everything, 
and the underlying layers are allowed to become complex and cluttered,
being designed according to the worse-is-better fallacy, and are only
suitable for developers with the time to study them, not power users,
who are completely left out.
