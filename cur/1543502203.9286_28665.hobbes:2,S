->cb is private information of the current layer.  So it should be fine
to pass information from X25/PPP to the driver. Just make sure you don't
hit TCP/IP or possible other layers inbetween. 
Some more link state in the generic part of the device would be nice too
- I sometimes wish TCP knew more about the status of my i4l devices.
