They're using cryptoapi to do the compression and encryption, and bio to do 
the I/O. Moving this to userspace will add extra complexity and of course 
slow down the process. It will also mean that to suspend and resume, the user 
will be unconditionally required to have an initrd or initramfs. This is 
already the case for the more complicated configurations (LVM, encryption 
with keys that need to be entered at a prompt etc), but most people simply 
use an unencrypted, compressed image on a swap partition and in that case do 
not and should not need the added complication of configuring an initrd.
Shouldn't the question be "Why are we making this more complicated by moving 
it to userspace?"
Regards,
Nigel
