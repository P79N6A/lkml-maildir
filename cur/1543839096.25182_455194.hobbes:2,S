kevent_poll uses hash table (actually it is kevent that uses table),
locking is simpler and part of it is hidden in kevent core.
Actually kevent_poll is just a container allocator for poll wait queue.
So epoll does not differ (except hash/tree and locking,
which is based on locks for pathes which are shared in kevent with those
ones which can be called from irq/bh context) from kevent + kevent_poll.
And since kevent_poll can be not selected while epoll is always there
(until embedded config is turned on), I recommend to have them both.
Or always turn kevent on :)
