Hello
I should add 1 giga of RAM to a machine which already has 1 giga. I know
I will have to configure bigmem support in the kernel (2.2.19). I would
like to know if this option is considered really stable and tested or I
can expect some problems, because this is a heavy loaded critical server
and in case of doubt I'll habilitate another server instead of  giving
more RAM to the one I already use.
Thanks in advance
