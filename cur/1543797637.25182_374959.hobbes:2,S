Oh, now looks like I understood what is meant. If a function uses 
stack-allocated messages, it should ensure that it will not exit until 
the message is processed (shouldn't it be documented somewhere?). But 
this solves the problem only partially since this technique fits only 
the synchronous transfers.
Functions targeting async transfers will anyway have to kmalloc the 
memory for message structure which makes your approach not really more 
lightweight then ours. It's mainly async transfers that need high 
throughput; and the drivers based on your core will have to kmalloc 
memory for messages in that case.
