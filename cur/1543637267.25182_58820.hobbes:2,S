On 64-bit architectures unsigned long is 64-bits so there is no problem. In 
fact the core kernel code _requires_ that unsigned long is large enough to 
fully contain the contents of a pointer. (E.g. look at linux/mm/memory.c, 
well really linux/mm/*.c for the tip of the iceberg).
Of course if one wanted to be really pedantic, one could replace the 
unsigned long typecasts with ptrdiff_t. But you would have to go through a 
_lot_ of code where the kernel currently casts between unsigned long and 
(mostly) void * to do this in a one off conversion.
Best regards,
