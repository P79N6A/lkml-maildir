Dear all,
I have one question from using vfs_symlink, is it usual after I called
vfs_symlink that will return a dentry with dentry->d_inode == NULL???
The link was sucessfully created but I receive a null inode pointer. 
When creating a symlink it should also create an inode. But according to
the documentation about VFS from Richard, the symlink call of
inode_operations, should self call d_instantiate() this also means it
should automatically create an inode pointer. This shouldn't be done by
the caller???? Any hints? the vfs_create works fine and return with a
proper inode number, why vfs_symlink doesn't? Thanks.
regards,
David Chow
