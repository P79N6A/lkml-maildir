Useless followup though -- hp.com rejects me as it feels the SPF neutral 
results gmail sends due to me not using the gmail SMTP server and/or web 
interface is something it wants to listen to.
I see you are @gmail as well, which depending on how you use it might mean 
your are also not able to reach @hp. If anyone can get HP to fix their mail 
setup, that'd be useful.
