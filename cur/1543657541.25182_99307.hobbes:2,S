Subject: a few more "make xconfig" inconsistencies

  (if any of these observations are going to the wrong list,
or are based on some fundamental misunderstanding of kernel
configuration, please let me know so i can minimize 
my embarrassment. :-)
  before i post any more observations on what i think are 
inconsistencies, here's another example, so i can be sure
that these are worth pointing out:
  even if, under "Networking options", i deselect IPv6,
i'm still presented with an inactive IPv6 Netfilter Configuration
screen.
  is *that* the sort of thing we're talking about?
