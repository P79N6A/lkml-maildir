I have a Toshiba MK-4006MAV laptop drive.  When 2.2 boots, it reports the drive
as having a 0k buffer.  The specs for the drive list the buffer as 512k.
Is this a known problem drive or is it broken in the kernel or is my drive just
broken.  (The latter may be true, but I have no reliable way to verify this.)
