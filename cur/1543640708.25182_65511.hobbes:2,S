Alan, hch or someone asked if it would be possible to merge the 2.5
behavior into 2.4-ac ... are you interested or do you not want to break
compatibility?
Note for "mode 2" the behavior is identical.  For "mode 3" they would
also need to set vm_memory_ratio to "0".
If you are willing, I'll send you a diff...
