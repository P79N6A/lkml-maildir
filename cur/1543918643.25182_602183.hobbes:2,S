David's change 10a8d6ae4b3182d6588a5809a8366343bc295c20, "i386: add
ptep_test_and_clear_{dirty,young}" has introduced an SMP race which
affects the Xen pv-ops backend.
In Xen, pagetables are normally kept RO so that the hypervisor can
mediate all updates to them.  If Xen sees a write to an active
(currently pointed to by cr3) or pinned (a currently inactive but
registered pagetable), it will trap the write fault and emulate the
instruction making the update; this means that most pagetable-modifying
code doesn't need to know or care that pagetables are RO.
When a pagetable is first created (either in execve or fork), the the
Xen paravirt backend pins the pagetable, and conversely, on exit it is
unpinned; this is done via the arch_dup_mmap() and activate_mm() hooks. 
Pinning is done in two phases: first the pagetable pages are marked RO,
and then the pagetable is registered with Xen; unpinning is the
opposite.  This works assuming that the pagetable is not in use, and not
yet visible to other cpus.
The race on pagetable creation is this: in kernel/fork.c:dup_mmap(), it
copies the old pagetable into the new one, and registers each vma with
the rmap prio tree.  Once everything is copied, it calls
arch_dup_mmap(), which ends up doing the Xen pagetable pin.  However,
because the pagetable is visible to other cpus via the prio tree,
pagetable modifications (specifically, clearing the access bit) can race
with pinning.  If it hits between making the pagetable pages RO but
before they're registered with Xen, modifications to the flags will
fault, and Xen won't know to do the fixup.
The converse is also true in exit_mmap(): arch_exit_mmap is called
before removing the vmas from the prio tree, so it can race with unpinning.
The specific oops I'm seeing is this:

It all worked OK before David's change, because asm-generic/pgtable.h
uses set_pte_at(), which ends up making a hypercall to update the
pagetable, which always works regardless of the state of the pagetable
pages.
It seems to me that there are a few ways to fix this:
   1. Use asm-generic/pgtable.h when CONFIG_PARAVIRT is enabled.  This
      will clearly work, but is pretty blunt.
   2. Make test_and_clear_pte_flags a new paravirt-op, which can be
      implemented in Xen as a hypercall, and as a raw test_and_clear_bit
      for everyone else.  The downside is adding yet another pv-op.
   3. Restructure the pagetable setup code so that the mm is not added
      to the prio tree until after arch_dup_mmap has been called (and
      the converse for exit_mmap).  This is arguably cleaner, but I
      haven't looked to see how much trouble this would be.
Thoughts anyone?  Does making the pagetables visible "early" cause
problems for anyone else?
Thanks,
    J
