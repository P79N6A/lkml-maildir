Well, good guess - you're getting more and more used with UML!
Yes, the fix is in -mm.
Quoting from -rc2-mm1 announce:
+uml-fix-compilation-for-__choose_mode-addition.patch
 UML fix
Andrew, can you merge it now, if you want, after Anton verifies it's the 
correct fix indeed for his problem? I *do* expect his situation to fail 
without the patch, but just to be more sure.
However, I recall with 2.6.11-bk7 a slightly different problem, when compiling 
only SKAS mode in, and I don't think this has been fixed:
[uml-devel] [UML/2.6] -bk7 tree does not run when compiled as SKAS-only
I'm forwarding that mail to LKML and you, Andrew - for your -rc regressions 
mail folder.
