hmmm, now that we need to keep this around, we might consider squeezing
it down to, say 64 bytes.  This stuff will probably never run for IRQs >
64 and probably a byte/level is enough.

I'll apply this Bjorn.
I have to complement you on your paranoia to
1. keep acpi_pci_irq_enable(dev) for all devices in 2.6.8
2. add pci=routeirq to diagnose the breakage when you took it out
