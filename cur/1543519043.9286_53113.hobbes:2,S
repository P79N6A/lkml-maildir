It basically POSTs the graphics card. Since I have all the code
there I've written a small extension to run int10 calls and dump
the pio access or whatever there is. Currently I'm working on a 
user if for that.

OK.

Xserver configuration is going to change in 4.0 to support
multihead. We would like to simplify it drastically however
this might not happen in 4.0. There are still too many things
to be taken care of and too few people helping.

I've just looked at the code again and I think it needs some
restructuring.
