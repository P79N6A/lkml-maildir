Hmm, I seem to be misrepresenting my role with this statement.
Yes, I found the bug in Coda, but the actual iget5_locked implementation
was largely based on the icreate patches from XFS that were sent to me
by Steve Lord.
There was a whole discussion on linux-fsdevel where Alexander Viro,
Anton Altaparmakov, Steve Lord, Christoph Hellwig, Chris Mason, and
probably others which I forgot all gave input and comments which I
merged into the patches before they were submitted to Linus.
Just to give credit where credit is due.
