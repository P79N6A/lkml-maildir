Alan, that's what I reported -- restricted to the system time -- two
days ago in <20001228151441.A3473@emma1.emma.line.org>. That mail is
also in my lk folder and has kernel.org Received: headers, so you should
have got that mail as well; plus you got it as copy. Is there something
wrong with mail routing?
