I am pretty impressed by Martins test case where merely all VM patches fail
with the exception of his own :-) The thing is, this test is not of nature
"very special" but more like "system driven to limit by normal processes". And
this is the real interesting part about it.

What exactly do you mean with "high IRQ rate"? Can you show so numbers from
/proc/interrupts and uptime for clarification?

Hm, I don't think real "big" patches are needed, Rik is according to Martins
test no gain currently as rmap flops in this test, too.
The problem is: you should really use one of your problem machines for at least
very simple testing. If you don't you possibly cannot expect your problem to be
solved soon. We would need input from your side. If I were you, I'd start of
with Martins patch. It is simple (very simple indeed), small and pinned to a
single procedure. Martins test shows - under "normal" high load (not especially
IRQ) - good result and no difference in standard load, I cannot see a risk for
oops or deadlock.
