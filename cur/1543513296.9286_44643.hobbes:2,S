From the current .../linux/Documentation/crypto/ChangeLog (after
applying the Linux-int patch): 
: * International kernel patch 2.2.10.4 released.
:
:	* Added new config option for using relative block numbers instead
: 	of absolute ones when calling the loop block device's transfer
: 	function.  This should fix the #1 issue with using loopback crypto
: 	filesystems.

Ernst
