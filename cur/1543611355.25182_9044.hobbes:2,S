Thats odd!
I don't have three various ide-controllers to reproduce your configuration, 
but for the raid5 of 3 various scsi disks i have that the times of dd readings for 
if= /dev/sda, /dev/md0, /mnt/file_on_reiserfs_on_md0 relates approximately as 
1.5 : 1 : 1   
So the performance doesn't decrease..
What is about your speed for (dd if=/dev/hdx...)??
Can you measure this for ext2 on md0?
Thanks,
Edward.
