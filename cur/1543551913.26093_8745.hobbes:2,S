	I wrote the SmartMedia FlashPath driver, and I can
say that the SmartMedia is fine, but the FlashPath is a 
little silly. (And I sometimes feel very bad for what
I was forced to write due to NDA and time constraints)..
	(See my post on C++ kernel modules....)
	(and evil sys_mount() syscall overloading...)
	(and evil /dev/fd0 driver overloading...)
	(basically this driver is an example of what NOT to
	 allow in a mainline kernel... but had to be written
	 that way to comply with marketing...)
