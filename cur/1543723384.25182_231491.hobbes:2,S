I hope I didn't make some stupid mistake in my program, but here it is, 
and
here are my results.  I'll probably go file a bug with Apple now :-D
zeus:~ kylemoffett$ cat >testp.c
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/mman.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/mman.h>
int main(int argc, char **argv) {
         long x = 100;
         void *mem;
         fprintf(stderr,"Starting...\n");
         mem = mmap(0,4096,PROT_WRITE,MAP_ANON|MAP_SHARED,-1,0);
         fprintf(stderr,"Mapped memory!\n");
         if (mem == 0) return 1;
         fprintf(stderr,"Address is %lx\n",(unsigned long)mem);
         ((long *)mem)[1] = x;
         fprintf(stderr,"Done!!!\n");
         return 0;
}
^D
zeus:~ kylemoffett$ gcc testp.c -o testp
zeus:~ kylemoffett$ ./testp
Starting...
Mapped memory!
Address is 4000
Bus error
zeus:~ kylemoffett$
Cheers,
