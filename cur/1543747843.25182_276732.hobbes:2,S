Interesting ... note also that it goes well with my intend of having
some of these (atomics, locks, ...) be provided by the kernel via the
vDSO library mapped by the kernel in userland on ppc. That library would
abstract that nicely. (That way, the kernel can take care of providing
the best implementation for a given processor, dealing with CPU errata
that often happen around areas of locks & atomics, etc...)
