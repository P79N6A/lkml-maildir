If by UML you mean Uniform Modelling Language, I don't understand where the
protection model has any impact. UML models flow, permissions are somewhat
superimposed, just like file permissions in a UML model on any machine.

Yes, and also those few machine operations that are "priveledged".

No, they run at full regular memory speed, at all levels of the memory
heirarchy.  Because of the flat unified address space, all caches can be in
virtual (this is common in 64-bit address systems) because a pointer means
the same thing no matter who uses it. A consequence is that you don't have
to cache scrub on task switch, which is a big time win.

Anybody can make all or part of themselves visible to anybody else. If you
start up an app in your space, you can grant visibility to a debugger in
another space. But this applies only to you. For example, suppose that your
app calls a paranoid server DLL passing in a function, and the DLL in turn
calls back your function. Then your stack will have a hunk of you (that you
can see and expose to the debugger), then a hunk of DLL function activations
(which are opaque to you AND the debugger unless you can talk the DLL into
exposing itself), and then another hunk of you again (and again visible to
you and the debugger). The DLL and you (and your debugger) are mutually
protected.
To do this on a conventional system requires that the DLL runs as a server
process, and getting it to do something for you requires a roundtrip through
the dispatcher. For us it's a simple subroutine call, just as if the DLL
were un-paranoid and had been linked into your code. Clearer?

Nope. The DMA has the same permissions as the driver that starts it.

We definitely want Linux. The question is whether Linux will want the result
of our port, or (in finer detail) what parts could we do in what way to be
useful to other people.
