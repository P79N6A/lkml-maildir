basically only VFS is mutex-bound really, and few of the 'benchmarks' tend 
to be VFS intense. Maybe things like mail-server benchmarks would do that.
Also, -v9 is like two days old code ;-) Old and crufty. The real 
performance uptick was not even in -v10 but in -v11 (the one we submitted 
in this thread).
