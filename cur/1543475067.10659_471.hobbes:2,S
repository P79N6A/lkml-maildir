I could reproduce this problem with ISDN and ipppd. When the connection seems
to be blocked on the second dial, then there is a duplicate entry in the 
routing table:
{harri@bilbo:harri 1} netstat -nr
Kernel IP routing table
Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags   MSS Window  irtt Iface
146.225.0.0     0.0.0.0         255.255.0.0     U         0 0          0 ippp0
146.225.0.0     0.0.0.0         255.255.0.0     U         0 0          0 ippp0
The default route disappeared somehow. 
I am not sure whether this is a kernel problem or a problem with ipppd.
