A process waiting for NFS data looses cpu time, which is spent on running 
something else.  Therefore, it gains some priority so it won't be
forever behind when it wakes up.  Same as for any other io waiting.
Perhaps expecting a 16-way parallel make to have "no impact" is
a bit optimistic.  How about nicing the make, explicitly telling
linux that it isn't important?  Or how about giving important
tasks extra priority?
