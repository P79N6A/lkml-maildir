No, these are not all fundamental.
1 Joule == 1 newton * 1 meter
The newton isn't fundamental either. It is defined in terms
of meters, seconds, and kilograms.
So if I've not mucked something up, 1 J == 1 m*kg*m/s/s.
Units get ugly when arbitrary powers of 10 get thrown in,
and worse with random odd constants. Amperes have a 2.0e-7
in the definition.
