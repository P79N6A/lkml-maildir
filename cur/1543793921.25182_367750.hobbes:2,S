No, I do not think so. He did not like the user<->kernel interface;
but that can be changed (and Rafael has plans to do that). I think we
can present nicer interface to userland without much code. Or maybe
not; but we can certainly limit /dev/kmem for suspend only -- and that
should make it acceptable security-wise.
