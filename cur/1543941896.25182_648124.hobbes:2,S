Hi,
I have this in dmesg:
DMAR:[DMA Write] Request device [00:02.0] fault addr ee1512000
DMAR:[fault reason 05] PTE Write access is not set
PCI-DMA: Intel(R) Virtualization Technology for Directed I/O
DMAR:[DMA Read] Request device [00:1d.7] fault addr 7d5f0000
DMAR:[fault reason 06] PTE Read access is not set
DMAR:[DMA Read] Request device [00:1a.7] fault addr 7d5f1000
DMAR:[fault reason 06] PTE Read access is not set
PCI-GART: No AMD northbridge found.
DMAR:[DMA Read] Request device [00:1a.2] fault addr 7d5f7000
DMAR:[fault reason 06] PTE Read access is not set
CONFIG_DMAR=y
CONFIG_DMAR_GFX_WA=y
CONFIG_DMAR_FLOPPY_WA=y
Without the gfx workaround, there is much more output regarding 00:02.0. Is 
there problem with broken hw, bios or drivers?
