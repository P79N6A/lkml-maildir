This is the only debug message i can see without keyboard.
serio: i8042 AUX Port at 0x60,0x64 irq 12
input: AT set2 keyboard on isa0060/serio0
serio i8042 KBD port at 0x60,0x64 irq 1
Can you tell me how to force the driver to enable my keyboard anyways?
It would be great, because booting is a pain right now.
