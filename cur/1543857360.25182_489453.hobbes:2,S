Following are 18 patches against 2.6.19-rc6-mm2 which are suitable for 2.6.20.
First 16 are from the NFSv4 team at umich (thanks Bruce).  Mostly
fixing minor bugs and tidying-up code.
Last 2 from me.  We haven't been testing against old versions of
nfs-utils and bit-rot has set in.  Some of that (hopefully all) has
been fixed.
