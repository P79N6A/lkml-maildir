So what do you actually suggest? On the one hand you say even 32bit userspace 
supports 64bit inodes, if it wants. On the other hand you say the truncation 
needs to be done on file system level. 
To my mind this is contradicting, the first statement suggests to do the 
truncation in userspace, the second says it can only be done in the kernel?
