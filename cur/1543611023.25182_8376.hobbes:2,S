Ugh, clearly the code is broken, so we don't want equivalent code, but
correct code.  Use the unambiguous "MODINC(x,y) ((x) = ((x) + 1) % (y))"
form and not "have a bug that has properly defined behaviour under ANSI C".
Just looking at the code, it is fairly clear that the desire is to keep
q_in and q_out >= 0 and < I20_EVT_Q_LEN, which is the size of the event_q
array.  With the buggy version, it is possible that you could have q_in or
q_out == I2O_EVT_Q_LEN, which is overflowing the array.  Bad, bad, bad.
