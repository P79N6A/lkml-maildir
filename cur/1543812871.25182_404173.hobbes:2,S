Linda,
I don't know (based on your email addressing) if you were directing this 
question at me, but since I'm the guy who originally reported this issue, 
here are my 'hdparm' results on my (standard Slackware 10.2) ReiserFS 
filesystem:
   2.6.13 (with 'nolargeio=1' for reiserfs mount): 
      readahead    = 256 (on)
   2.6.13 (without 'nolargeio=1' for reiserfs mount): 
      readahead    = 256 (on)
   2.4.31 ('nolargeio' option irrelevant/unavailable for 2.4.x): 
      readahead    = 8 (on)
