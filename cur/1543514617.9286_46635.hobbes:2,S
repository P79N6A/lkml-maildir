Hi there,
We want to put our own boot_logo in the kernel, when framebuffers is
enabled. But the format seems a little spectacular. All of our graphical
manipulation programs (ee, xv, gimp) can save the real format, but only
B/W (.xbm). Anyone has a script or a link to another program that does the
job? 
Or even better; a link to an URL that tells about boot logo with
framebuffers enabled - the format's etc.?
