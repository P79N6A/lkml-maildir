Don't worry, everyone starts out not knowing what they are doing.
The ext3_free_blocks() part looks OK from a cursory review.

I'm not sure why the "find_next_usable_block()" part is in here?  At this
point we KNOW that ret_block is not a block we should be allocating, yet
it is marked free in the bitmap.  So we should just mark the block(s) in-use
in the bitmap and look for a different block(s).

Note that we need to loop over "num" blocks and set any bits that should
be set, as is done in the ext3_free_blocks() code.  This function has
changed since 2.4 in that it can now potentially allocate multiple blocks.
