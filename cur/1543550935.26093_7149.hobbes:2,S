It is actually used in two places, in the fast path and there. It isn't
as bad as it looks because it is only used in user context and could
be fixed by putting a special flag into the sock for the execute
in user context case (or just supply an argument that is passed around) 
The point was just that there are probably other users of current
in interrupt context and AFAIK it works currently in all ports
so you would need to fix these (mostly buggy) occurrences.
If you ever wanted to do a SMP VAX port you would also need to fix
smp_processor_id().
