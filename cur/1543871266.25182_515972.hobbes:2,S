Hi all,
I realize I have been a bit MIA lately, but I'm going to try to make 
forward progress again on klibc.  I have pushed the current integrated 
tree up to 2.6.21-rc2; so far, no functional enhancements, but I'm 
looking at the following:
- Mount-by-label/mount-by-uuid.
- Ability to fall back on different roots.
- nfsroot on NFSv4.
- nfsroot over IPv6, as soon as the kernel supports NFS over IPv6.
As always, thoughts are appreciated.
