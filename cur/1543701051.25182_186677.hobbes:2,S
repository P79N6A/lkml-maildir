Just a suggestion, but why not use vga=normal, which is text mode, instead of 
graphics.  You don't get the boot logo, but it does give you all the boot 
messages on 80x24.  I have been having the same issues, with an Nvidia card, 
and I decided it wasn't worth spending any time on it, since I really just 
wanted to see the messages, not any pictures.
