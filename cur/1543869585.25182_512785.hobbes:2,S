Which is right, because the IP layer is the place which knows how to
map IP addresses to link layer addresses.
IP must know its link layer. E.g. it needs a way to decide if the link
layer is multicast capable at all.

"Link layer address" is not a generic concept at all, even though too
much code assumes everything is Ethernet.
