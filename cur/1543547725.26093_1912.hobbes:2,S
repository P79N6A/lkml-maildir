A (better?) kernel debugger could help (certain) people to help improve
the long term health, because they can't (or don't want) to use what's
available, or just think they can't easely do it with them. It could help
certain people who are used to debug a problem in certain ways, to debug
it, where they have no idea how to do it with the current tools, because
nobody explained them how to use them for that problem.
That debugger shouldn't be part of the main kernel, specially if it's so
complex. Trying to get the debugger to work might even find problems you
wouldn't easely find otherwise.
