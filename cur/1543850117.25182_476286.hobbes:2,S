If this is the case, then we cannot support it the way the MMC layer is
built right now. A CRC error means the data is bad and might not even be
in the buffer.
To be honest, many controllers will probably not even transfer the data
to the CPU, so we can't just ignore the CRC error. So for now, I guess
this will have to be an unsupported feature.
