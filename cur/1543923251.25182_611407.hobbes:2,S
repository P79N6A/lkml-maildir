Speaking of sg fixups...  What should be done about zfcp_address_to_sg()?
You've added the third argument to all calls, but not to definition...
static inline void
zfcp_address_to_sg(void *address, struct scatterlist *list, size_t size)
{
	sg_set_buf(list, address, size);
}
seems to be a plausible guess at what you meant to do, but that's a guess
without anything to back it - I really have not looked into the area at all.
