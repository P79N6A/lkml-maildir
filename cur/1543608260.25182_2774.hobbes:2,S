Subject: alpha tru64 mmap broken in linus kernels

alan's 2.4.13-ac* kernels work fine, but using 2.4.13, mmap fails for tru64
binaries. i tried applying an old fix for it (similar to the one that's in
alan's tree now), but it still fails. does anyone have a patch to fix
mm/mmap.c in linus's kernels? 2.4.14-pre6 is still broken.
