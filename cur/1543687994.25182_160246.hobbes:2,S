Subject: pci=irqmask=0xffdf has no effect on 2.6.0-test3/2.6.0-test4

I'm trying to mask off IRQ's so the kernel won't assign my PCI devices 
to 3,4,5, or 7.  I believe that mask I have above is for IRQ 5, but it 
doesn't have any effect with 2.6.0-test3/4.  It does work on kernel 2.4.18.
Has this changed on the kernel and just hasn't been documented in the 
docs or am I passing the wrong parameter for preventing the kernel from 
using IRQs?
Thanks,
Wes
