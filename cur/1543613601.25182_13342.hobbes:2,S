Hi Richard, I'm using your new init and happy with it (thanks!).
I am very willing to discuss other side of a coin (i.e. shutdown sequence),
let's do it off the list.

I don't use your shutdown, I found it possible to spawn a shell script
in a new process group and use killall5 to term/kill everything except this 
process group. It works. (But yesterday I saw fsck again... something did not
get umounted?) I can mail my scripts to you for a little discussion. Mail me.
