Why can't this be done by distributors/vendors?
Any vendor is free to branch off at 2.6.<whatever> and then maintain
that indefinately.  Why create yet-another-stable-branch?
In effect you'd be making 2.6.17+ into a 2.7.x tree and 2.6.16.y would
become a 2.6 tree in 2.4.x style, with all the backporting problems
and vendor skew that 2.4.x suffered from.
Personally I don't like this proposal. In my oppinion 2.6 + the
-stable branch as we have it now works well and people who want
userspace & kernel in sync are perfectly free to use vendor kernels
(which is also the recommended thing to do for most users as far as I
know).
Just my 0.02euro.
