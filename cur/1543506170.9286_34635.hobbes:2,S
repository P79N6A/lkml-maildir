Hi,
    Could someone give me a quick explanation on how to bind a program to a
TTY as its controlling TTY after it has opened it?  e.g. after it has just
opened a /dev/ttypx pseudo-TTY device, it wants to make it its controlling
terminal so that when you use ps ax, it will show that tty as being the
processes's controlling TTY.  I believe the kernel list would be most
appropriate for advice on this since I'm sure it's a kernel-based system call
that does it.
Thanks
