I haven't thought about the specifics there. Perhaps the plugin prompts
for one, or perhaps it takes a lilo parameter? Since the resume time
command line gets forgotten with the switch back to the original kernel,
I don't think that would introduce any insecurity. Anyway, not being a
security expert, I'll leave that issue to whoever cares enough to make
an encryption plugin.
