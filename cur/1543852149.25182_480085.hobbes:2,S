Yes.

It would be cleaner, but not absolutely necessary.

The card does pay attention, and other programs such as lspci and the
like also look at the config space.  They should definitely be kept
in sync, and config writes are fairly cheap, anyway.

The HT layer should always do the config updates, since you are trying
to clean up that layer.  Only the "extra" stuff (if any) should be done by
the callback.
