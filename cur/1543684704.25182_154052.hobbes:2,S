Hi,
I'm trying to get decent performance (e.g. DMA, not PIO) extracting audio with 
cdparanoia from an new IDE CD-ROM.  The current problem is very slow ripping 
and very high system CPU time.  hdparm reports DMA is on, and reading data is 
perfectly fast.
What kernel versions and patches should I be trying?
(Please cc: me, emailing in reply to linux.kernel posts munges threading)
Thanks,
