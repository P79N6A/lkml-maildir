It's the concept of 'good enough' that seems to have different meanings for
different people.
Personally I could even think that the behaviour for the UP case is 'almost'
the same but, as you can see by watching at the lk threads in the last years,
it's pretty hard to try people to agree on the concept of 'good enough'.
Config options will leave the current scheduler for UP ( or even for not heavy
MP ) while will introduce an option to users that will suffer scheduler
problems.

Even when I go at the restaurant I've to chose, but I still prefer that instead
of getting the 'menu du jour'.
