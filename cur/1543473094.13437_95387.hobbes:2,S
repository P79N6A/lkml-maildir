And some years ago you gave us (i.e. the Linux community) to understand that 
"the system" was to be based on the Hurd, and that we were at best 
hangers-on.  I wouldn't be at all surprised to find that this is the core of 
discontent:  as if Andrew Tanenbaum were to suddenly start advertizing Minix 
as "the forerunner of Linux".
