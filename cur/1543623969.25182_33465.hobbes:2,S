I'm willing to help you out with this if you like (especially as I caused
some of the current ifdefs ;-)).

The above are what I'm really afraid of. I think the best way to avoid 
most of the downside is to split up some of the current monster functions 
(like setup_arch) into generic and platform-specific parts ... exactly as 
Pat's patch does.
It would be nice to see a "blessing in principle" from Marcelo and
Linus before we / you start spending lots of time on this.
