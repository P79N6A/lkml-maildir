I am looking into this, and it really is looking like there's a low
level driver bug somewhere either EIOing an interrupt twice, or missing
one.  Were you doing Network I/O at the time?  Check 'ifconfig' when you
get the errors and see if there were any RX errors reported by the LAN
card when the ide-scsi problems show up.  I am seeing it here, and it is
looking like a device is missing an interrupt, and/or another device is
getting it.  Could also be a bug in the APIC code as well.
