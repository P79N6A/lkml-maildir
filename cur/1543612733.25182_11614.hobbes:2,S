Hi!
suspend-to-ram was not working on athlons... Now I found the reason...
We wrote some data to memory, and then told hw to powerdown everything
but memory.
But somehow data were not in memory.
So I added mdelay(1000) and printk().
Data were still not in memory.
So I added wbinvd().
Yep, that helped. That means that athlons happily write-back-cache
data for 1 second.... Ouch.
Okay, I just did not expect *that* kind of trick being played at me.
