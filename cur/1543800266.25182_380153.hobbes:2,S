Why would that matter?

Why is this?  What is so messy about the in-kernel i2c interfaces?
(yeah, I know that there are some oddities, just want to know what you

Compatibility with what?  The driver isn't in the kernel tree yet, so
there's no old kernel versions to remain compatibile with :)
I also noticed that you are still using the uint64_t type variable
types, can you please switch to the proper kernel types instead (u64 in
this specific example.)
