Quoting myself (again):
>> A quick'n'dirty ZFS-vs-UFS-vs-Reiser3-vs-Reiser4-vs-Ext3 'benchmark'
Yeah, the test ran on a single SATA-Harddisk (quick'n'dirty).
I'm so sorry but i don't have access to a $$$ Raid-System at home. 
Anyway: The test shows us that Reiser4 performed very good on my
(common 0-8-15) hardware.

How about using /dev/emcpower* for the next benchmark?
I mighty be able to re-run it in a few weeks if people are interested
and if i receive constructive suggestions (= Postmark parameters,
mkfs options, etc..)
Regards,
 Adrian
