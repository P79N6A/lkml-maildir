Known?  Yes.
What people would expect? No.

Speaking for all Intel hardware implemented from pre-history until now,
deep C-states is the best you can do, and there is no special offline
mode to save more power.
If you really want to not use a core and the above bug isn't fixed in linux,
you can use maxcpus=1 to never bring the other core on-line in the first place,
and if the BIOS is implemented properly, the core will be spinning in the
deepest available C-state.  Of course, it would probably be more interesting
to simply leave the core on-line and let it go idle...
