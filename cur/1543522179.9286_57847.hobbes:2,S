Even if this would be changed, glibc still needs to properly handle
some of the structs which have been enlarged.  And changing the size
of kernel_uid_t might enlarge some structs - this would lead to lots
of incompatibility.
glibc 2.2 will have support for older kernels with 16bit and and newer
ones with 32bit UIDS - without a need to recompile your application.
