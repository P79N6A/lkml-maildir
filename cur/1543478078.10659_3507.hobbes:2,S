IMHO it is not only important to have a competent GUI desktop for linux
to make it more popular for home PC users. What I think is missing for the
not-so-experienced PC user is an easy to configure installation tool for
the kernel configuration. The make menuconfig is not sufficient  
as it still requires a lot of knowledge about hardware chips and card
definitions, IRQs and such which isn't common knowledge to a new PC user.
I don't know if that's an issue or of anybody else concern in this
disussion, just would like to know if it's addressed anywhere in general. 
Some distributors try to address the idea but the solution is
proprietary to the distributor. 
Thanks,
Eva
