Hello All,
	First off, this is probably a straight C question, but here goes...
	I was looking at the kernel code, and in protocol.c the protocol structures are
instansiated and filled.  Now, I have seen/used the following syntax:
	struct x y = { x, y, z };
	
I have not seen the following:
	struct x y = {
		member1: x,
		member2: y,
		member3: z
	};
What is the deal with this?  Does the second way have any advantage over the previous?
Thanks in advance,
Chuck
