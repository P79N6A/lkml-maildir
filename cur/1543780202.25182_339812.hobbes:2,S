Curious. First of all, I have a request: do not call this device a "stick".
It is terribly misleading word with which to call a fully-featured MP3
player. DNT uses it in a specific context, as a product name.
I'd like to have a usbmon trace of a session, from plugging, through
copying, through unplugging. Do not send it to the whole cc: list.
Do you need instructions?
