Why ?
What if I want to do things differently. Right now I can re-educate syncppp.
I can for example switch to hardware ppp and use software for X.25

Almost every "mid layer" in the kernel has proved to be a mistake in the

The ppp kernel code grabs frames of known types (IP etc) the rest are vectored
to the daemon to handle in userspace
