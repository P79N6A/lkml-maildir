David's Patches were only a work-in-progress, not really ready for
serious use yet.  The usage of "d_path" in nfsd_netlink_notify is all
wrong for a start.
I have mailed David privately about this and he plans to tidy it up
soonish, but until then, I don't think the mountd changes in 1.5
should be used, so I won't be making a patch against them.
If you want to read more about our thoughts on the direction for this
patch, I have an archive of interesting knfsd related stuff (from
various lists and private) under
