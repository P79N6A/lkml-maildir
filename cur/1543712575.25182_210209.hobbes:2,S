So, I seem to have found the bugger causing higher temps: It is NVidia 
binary driver, or rather its AGP part of the 53.36 driver. Using AGPGART 
and Nvidia driver leaves my system cool. Using NVAGP it seems as though 
C1 state isn't actually used anymore thus making the CPU hotter.
Tested with (and without) ACPI and APIC (and Ross' tack patch). 
Currently running in PIC mode (with ACPI) and idle temp of 44°C (instead 
of about 50°C...). But it was as cool in APIC mode.
Of course I have to test few more days, but at least currently I am 
happy again. :-)
