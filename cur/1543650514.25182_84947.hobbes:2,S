And then ppc32 does some binutils checks, not-in-C and before we let the
kernel get too far.  What I was proposing is we add something outside of
the direct kernel src (something in scripts?  Generic make magic?) to
verify that a compiler / binutils / whatever tool is a good version.
This is rather easy for binutils + obvious instruction problem (missing
/ incorrect operands), and for compiler versions, something to generate
a test-file and then see if it compiles.
