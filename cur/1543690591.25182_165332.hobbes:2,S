# All the keyboard lights.
That probably means that your keyboard did a reset.
# the keycodes are screwed up (like the left alt button)
Most keys are still OK but a few, like left alt, have become bad?
# now with test 5, the keyboard seems to stop responding completely
Do you mean it doesnt work at boot time?
Or do you mean that you work for a while, a reset happens,
and after that the keyboard is dead?
# kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
I asked elsewhere - let me repeat the question:
does this repeat stop (only) when you hit the next key?
