No question about that. We actually already get this from rpm signatures. What 
would module signatures buy us? The kernel could then reliably determine that 
an unsigned module was loaded. But people could still fake their Oopses, or 
overwite the flags which indicate that a module's signature didn't match, so 
we still wouldn't reliably get at that information.
