Nick,
We ran your patch on STP against one of our database workloads (DBT3 on
postgreSQL which uses file system rather than raw).
The test was able to compile, successfully start up the database,
successfully load the database from source file, successfully run the
power test (single stream update/query/delete).   
It failed, however at the next stage, where it starts 8 streams of query
and one stream of updates/deletes where it ran for approximately 40
minutes (usually takes over an hour to complete).  The updates appear to
have completed and only queries were active at the time of failure.  See
the error message below from the database log.
The queries did produce results and the query streams appear to have
failed at the same time.

Jenny searched the postgreSQL site for this error and so far can't find
any more details about it.  We are puzzled by the error on the log when
at the time there should not have been any actual updates.  We will
forward this question to the PostreSQL folks.
