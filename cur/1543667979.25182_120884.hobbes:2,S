   In that case, you'll need to have things like spin_lock_irqrestore()
   call local_bh_enable() in order to run the pending softirqs. Is that
   worth the trouble?
"trouble" is a weird word to use when the current behavior is
just wrong. :-)
My point is that it doesn't matter what the fix is, running
softints while hw IRQs are disabled must be fixed.
