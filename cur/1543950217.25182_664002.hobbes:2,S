I assumed that this exactly what we meant by the boot set all along :).
One thing I wanted to clarify that by all IRQs we literally mean all of them
even those that do not have handlers yet. /proc/irqN/smp_affinity for example
 is not available for the irqs are not active. In other words an IRQ must not
all of the sudden show up in the root set when something does request_irq() on
it.
This applies to other thing too.

I think Paul missed my earlier reply where I pointed out that original patch
conflicted with /proc/irq/N/smp_affinity API. The solution is for
irq_set_affinity() to enforce cpus_allowed just like sched_setaffinity does
for the tasks.
