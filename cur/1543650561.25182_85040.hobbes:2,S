Yup.
My point here is that while Pavel approach is to kill/suspend anything
that may trigger new IO requests (thus topping all userland, stopping
selected kernel threads, etc...), I tend to think we leave all that
alive, and just block requests going to suspended devices until those
get alive again. That used to work well on pmac and leads to very
fast suspend/resume cycles.
Ben.
