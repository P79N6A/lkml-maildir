The only thing about icount that needs to be
tracked is that it changes, which indicates
an interrupt might have changed hw_stopped.
If icount changes at all, invalidate the last
reading of the state and do it again. The way
icount is incremented is not changed.
Like I said, it is really ugly. I was just looking
for a way of allowing get_mctrl to sleep if necessary.
