Depending on how linker places percpu data, the patches could
increase or decrease percpu section size. Data from 2.6.21-rc7-mm2:
On x86 SMP, the section size is increased from 0x7768 to 0x790c.
1.3% increase.
On X86-64 SMP, the size is decreased from 0x72d0 to 0x6540.
11.8% decrease.
On X86-64 VSMP, the size is increased from 0x72d0 to 0x8340.
14.3% increase.
On IA64 SMP, the size is decreased from 0x8370 to 0x7fc0.
2.8% decrease.
