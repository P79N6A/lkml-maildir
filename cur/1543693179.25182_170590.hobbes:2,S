Hello again.
The aironet driver under 2.6.0-test6-bk6 doesn't seem to be able to see
  my access point anymore.  /proc/driver/aironet/eth1/Config is set the same
  between 2.4.21 and 2.6.0-test6-bk6, yet the 2.4 driver can talk to the
  base station and the 2.6 driver cannot.  Indeed, no AP is listed in Status,
  and a MAC of all FFs is listed in iwconfig's AP listing.
Any ideas?  I see no oopses, just no traffic.  The radio is going, and I
  can see the lights blinking.
Thanks again!
-Joseph

"Asked by CollabNet CTO Brian Behlendorf whether Microsoft will enforce its
 patents against open source projects, Mundie replied, 'Yes, absolutely.'
 An audience member pointed out that many open source projects aren't
 funded and so can't afford legal representation to rival Microsoft's. 'Oh
 well,' said Mundie. 'Get your money, and let's go to court.' 
Microsoft's patents only defensive?
