This one is culprit. If you'll comment this message out, it will not
crash.

Ok. It means that hardware is completely uninitialized when this happens.
Probably accelerator clocks are stopped (== message about pixclocks was
right...) Bad.
Does driver work with your change without problems? It looks strange
to me that PLL did not stabilized in 5 seconds. Do you get same message
when you change videomode with fbset, or happens this only once during
boot, and never again?
                                        Thanks,
