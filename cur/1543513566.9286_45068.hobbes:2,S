Runnin rh 6.1 with kernel version 2.12-20.
On booting, get message: fsck.ext2 for device /dev/hdb6 exited with
signal 10.
You drop down into shell and then reboot.
On subsequent boot fsck for /dev/hdb6 WORKS, no message.
On booting a Third time, get message: fsck.ext2 for device /dev/hdb6
exited with signal 10.
 This flip flops every time.
