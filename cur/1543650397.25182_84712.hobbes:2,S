Hi Alex,
Thanks, I think the Elan SC520 is all I need. I don't know if the other
chips in the family have the same bug. 
There is a conflict between the Elan work-around and the 16C654 UART. It
looks like the work-around causes it to drop transmit data. If I can know
for sure the detected type of the Elan's ports, then I can shield all other
UART types from the work-around with a quick type field check without losing
the benefit of the work-around. 
Suggestions are welcome.
Best regards,
Ed
