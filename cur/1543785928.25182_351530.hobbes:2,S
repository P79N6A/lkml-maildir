This is often caused by disks running in PIO instead of DMA.

probably something which will turn your tool into sort of a complex and
unusable one when another session running 'top' could do the trick.
Oh, BTW, the first reason I wrote my tool was to avoid copying into
/dev/null which consumes a small amount of CPU. Thus, I made it a pure
data eater. It might be interesting to run it instead of 'dd' while your
tool is running, to see if system usage decreases a bit.
