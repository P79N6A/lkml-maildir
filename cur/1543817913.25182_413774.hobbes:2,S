    David> You were using an interface in an unintended way.
There were a lot of opportunities to suggest a better way or even just
raise the alarm when IPoIB was first being reviewed.  And I don't
remember anyone giving any guidance or insight into the neighbour
destructor design the three or four times Michael raised the issue of
the IPoIB crash and posted this patch for review....

Of course it's not %100 certain, but it definitely fixes a panic in
IPoIB, and the clip.c change looks "obviously correct."
If this patch is too risky for -stable, that's fine.  But let's be
clear that it _does_ fix a panic people hit in practice, and as far as
I know it doesn't break the ATM build
