Alan and Co,
By chance I was culling through my boot log and noticed the following:
Initializing CPU#0
Detected 8132.282 MHz processor.
Now, I'd *love* to have a processor that could do that for real, but
don't think my Athlon XP quite makes the grade.  :-)
Looking through my boot logs, this problem seems to start somewhere
between 2.4.19-pre2-ac4 and 2.4.19-pre4-ac1 (I didn't run any of the
intervening releases).
It's also sporadic -- out of 5 reboots, the proper speed (1466.559 MHz)
was detected 2 of the 5 times.  Dropping back to 2.4.19-pre2-ac4 gives
me correct detection 5 of 5.  No config changes were made between these
kernels (except =n for any new options).
System:
Athlon XP 1700+
Soyo SY-K7VX MB (VIA KT266A)
1GB ECC PC2100 Memory
Redhat 7.2 (stock+updates with the exception of the kernel and XFree 4.2
(to support my ATI 7500 card)
Everything from the P/S to the cpu fan is AMD spec'd and environment
sensors show normal.
Please let me know if more info is needed...
