Hello!
Is my observed behavior correct? I find that R/W access to a named-pipe
can be detected with select() and poll(), but does not seem to
use a signal (not even SIGPIPE, SIGPOLL, or SIGIO)?
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <signal.h>
#include <poll.h>
#define FIFO "/tmp/foo"
void nothing(int sig)
{
   fprintf(stdout, "Got signal %d\n", sig);
   fflush(stdout);
   (void)signal(sig, nothing);
}
int main()
{
    char buf[0x100];
    int fd;
    int flags;
    int len;
    int i;
    struct pollfd po;
    for(i=1 ;i < 32 ; i++)
        (void)signal(i, nothing);
 
    (void)unlink(FIFO);
    (void)mkfifo (FIFO, 0777);
    fd = open(FIFO, O_RDWR);
    flags = fcntl(fd, F_GETFL);
    flags |= FASYNC;
    if(fcntl(fd, F_SETFL, flags) < 0)
        fprintf(stderr, "You can't do that (F_SETFL)!\n");
 
    if(fcntl(fd, F_SETOWN, getpid()) < 0)
        fprintf(stderr, "You can't do that (F_SETOWN)!\n");
    for(;;)
    {
        po.fd = fd;
        po.events = POLLIN;
        poll(&po, 1, 0x00080000);
        {
            len = read(fd, buf, 0x100);
            if(len > 0)
                write(1, buf, len);
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
Writes from another process are detected and displayed, i.e.,
`ls >/tmp/foo` works. However, no signal is generated.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
