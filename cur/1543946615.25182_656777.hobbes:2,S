This is of course viable alternative. And I was considering this, but
later I abandoned the idea: that way we'll end up doing math in the
native endianness and then converting it to the foreign. This feels
ugly in contrast when we can do the right math in the first place, per
framebuffer.

Yup, another downside of changing the code to fix some narrow
problem. Plus, this means things will break if/when we'll attach
PCI video card into the MPC8360E-RDK.
