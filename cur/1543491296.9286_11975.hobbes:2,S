What is a Von Neumann execution stream? ;)

Why you need CPUID?
If you need to know some features from the CPU you probably want to use
the information we grabbed at boot time in the current_cpu_data struct.
About the volatile thing the reason I thought it's not needed is that we
care that rdtsc is run always at the same offset of code. We care only
about the _delta_ between the two rdtsc. So basically I seen not using
__volatile__ as a feature. Comments?
