See the operation of set_page_dirty().
If you have NULL ->set_page_dirty a_op then set_page_dirty() will fall
through to __set_page_dirty_buffers().
If your fs never sets PG_private then __set_page_dirty_buffers() will just
do what __set_page_dirty_nobuffers() does.
Without having looked at it, I'm sure that hostfs does not use
buffer_heads.  So setting your ->set_page_dirty a_op to point at
__set_page_dirty_nobuffers() is a reasonable thing to do - it'll provide a
slight speedup.
