What about just exporting the 'type' field that we use to index into
swap_info[]?
As far as /proc goes, it may not be _ideal_ for your traces, but it sure
beats not getting the information out at all. ;)  I guess I'm just not
that familiar with the tracing requirements and I can't really assess
whether what you're asking for is reasonable, or horrible
over-engineering.  Dunno.
