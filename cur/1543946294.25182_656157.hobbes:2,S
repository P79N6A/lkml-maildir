Now that notifiers are in, (yay!), people are going to start writing adapters
for visually and motor impaired individuals.
I suggest we place them in drivers/adapters in the source tree,
and I suggest they put their virtual files in the directory /proc/adapters,
which would be created via fs/proc/root.c as part of the /proc file system.
Adapter foo would create /proc/adapters/foo, and put its files in that directory.
Naturaly it would rm -r /proc/adapters/foo upon module exit.
I'm already working on my third adapter, and we need some kind of organization.
What do you think?
If you like, I can write and submit a patch that does this.
