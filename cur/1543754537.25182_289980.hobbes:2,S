Ok, I briefly looked over the patches and that is what I understand
(please correct me where I am wrong):
- you have superio chips which are containers providing set of interfaces;
- you have superio chip driver that detects superio chip and manages
  (enables/disables) individual interfaces.
- you have set of interface drivers (gpio, acb) that bind to individual
  superio interfaces and provide unified userspace interface that allows
  reading, writing and analog of ioctl.
So the question is why you can't have superio bus where superio chips
register their individual interfaces as individual devices. gpio, acb, etc
are drivers that bind to superio devices and create class devices gpio.
You could have:
sys
|-bus
| |-superio
| | |-devices
| | | |-sio0 -> ../../../devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1e.0/0000:02:03.0/sio0
| | | |-sio1 -> ../../../devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1e.0/0000:02:03.0/sio1
| | | |-sio2 -> ../../../devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1e.0/0000:02:04.0/sio2
| | |-drivers
| | | |-gpio
| | | | |-sio1 -> ../../../../devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1e.0/0000:02:03.0/sio1
| | | | |-sio2 -> ../../../../devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1e.0/0000:02:04.0/sio2
| | | |-acb
| | | | |-sio0 -> ../../../../devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1e.0/0000:02:03.0/sio0
|
|-class
| |-gpio
| | |-gpio0
| | |-gpio1
gpioX have control and data attributes that allow reading and writing...
Am I missing something?
