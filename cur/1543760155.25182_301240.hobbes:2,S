It even looks to me like the Geode GX1 (SCx200 family) is a Cyrix MediaGX
design, the Geode GX2 (Geode GX 533@1.1W and company) I suspect is an
AMD k6 based design (given the 400Mhz speed, and the inclusion of 3Dnow
and MMX), and of course the Geode NX is athlon based.
Now if the Geode GX1 in fact runs faster optimized for 486 rather than
586 (I have been running one as 586tsc since it had mmx and tsc in its
feature list), then I think I will be recompiling my kernel to see if I
can't make this 266MHz GX1 run almost as fast as a 400MHz PXA255 (arm).
Right now it has somewhat lower ethernet bandwidth than the arm.
