You can mix and match processor types all you want...  just treat them 
as completely asynchronous and independent entities.
I have long dreamed of being able to add a PCI card to my x86 system, a 
PCI card containing a processor (of any type), RAM, and an ethernet 
interface.  I would use this for routing, or iSCSI, or network offload...
