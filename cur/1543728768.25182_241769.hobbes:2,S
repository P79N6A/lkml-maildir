Agreed, but as Alex Riesen has shown with his test case, the behavior
differs based on the type of socket. This doesn't seem quite right, but
was not my original point.

Only if SO_LINGER is on, and then only for the linger time. I would
expect recvmsg to set errno to EINTR or EINVAL indicating that the recv
message was interrupted or is no longer valid since the socket has
closed. This is not the case. Instead it returns 0, and doesn't set errno.
