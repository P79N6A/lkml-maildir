Indeed. Could you all please hassle SiS for the datasheet for the 7012
integrated audio controller in the SiS 735?
They say you should contact their marketing people about datasheets
using a web based form
        
http://www.sis.com/contact/salescontact.htm
Alternatively, random people at SiS can be spammed about the lack of
datasheet or open linux driver. It'd be nice if someone could give
them a physical telephone call, but I don't have access to a landline
so it'd be really expensive for me :-(
