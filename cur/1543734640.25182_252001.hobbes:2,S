Hi,
I'm very new to kernel development.  I'm implementing a mechanism in the CIFS 
VFS client to ensure that the maximum number of outstanding requests is not 
exceeded.  To do this I'm using a semaphore.  It works for a while, but 
eventually (while doing some torture tests that send/receive many > 10MB 
files simultaneously by multiple threads) my computer freezes.  The logs show 
the message "bad: scheduling while atomic!" followed by a trace.  I'm 
guessing this is where the problem is.  So my question is, if my semaphore is 
causing that error, what possible things could be triggering it?  Could it be 
an interrupt while waiting to acquire the semaphore?  I'm using the 
down_interruptible() to acquire and up() to release.
Thanks,
James
