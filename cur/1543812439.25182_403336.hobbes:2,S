It looks to me that you want to use something more like unionfs with
COW/whiteout mode - there's an implementation based on FUSE available
but I've not really looked at it. Obviously you might just want
something in mainline, in which case you're limited to the FUSE idea
or one of the others already suggested.

This is why I suggest you look at the above.
