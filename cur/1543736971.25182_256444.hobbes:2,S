Having a max_readahead pages completely in cache is pretty good reason
to switch-off readahead. Yes it is aggressive, and the downside of
this is multiple 4k I/o. That is the reason we need the slow-read
patch[patch number 5] to speed up the slow-read path.

Well does not seem to hurt!

yes. But think about it. Why did a page get thrashed?  there
is memory pressure. Hence better stop reading ahead. Again
yes it is agressive. And to compensate the agression we need the 
slowread patch that fixes the slow read path.

yes but with the slowread patch, we attempt to read pages
and then do_generic_mapping_read() anyway attempts to check if the
page frame is there. This is a small optimization. You did mention that you
saw .5% decrease in CPU time. Did'nt you?

We never disagreed. Did we? :) The concern Andrew had was, have you
tried to fix the problem with the current code, and then check
if your patch does better with the fixed-code.
I am trying to help you get a solid case to get Andrew's acceptance.
So with these set of patches, your algorithm and the current algorithm
are on even playing ground to do some fair comparison.

2proc 700Mhz , 2GBmemory. Ultra160 SCSI disk.

256k iosize with 50 prefetchers.

correct observation. My filesize is 1.2GB and memory size is 2GB so it 
will end up being entirely cache based. Good observation. Rerunning
with a larger file.

sure. that will help. And once results are in place, its Andrew's call.
No, these patches are not in competition with yours.
Its just helping you to convince others.

Thought I was helping you out, No?
BTW: the last patch 5_fixedslowread.patch accidently did not contain all 
the changes. Enclosed the remaining changes.
