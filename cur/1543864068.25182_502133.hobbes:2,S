You can't measure work-conservation by summing! Everything is ran 
_concurrently_. A proof of losing computing power is to show 
"MAX(new_algorithm execution_times) > MAX(old_algorithm 
execution_times)". Anyway... it still seems lots of power is lost: 
MAX(766,766) >> MAX(472,257).
Actually, I'd be very interested by a "fairness number" and believe so 
far no one as proposed such thing. Probably needs to take into account 
the loss of CPU power and the variance of execution time in between the 
sets of tasks which are supposed to be fair.

Another worthy benchmark would be :
(make -s -j4 bzImage) vs (nice make -s -j20 bzImage)
