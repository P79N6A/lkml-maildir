Dear all
Can you help maybe?  I've managed to hack the IDE-floppy and IDE drivers so
that
they see my MO disk.  Linux now (kinda) believes that it can drive this
little gadget
as an ide-floppy (type 7) ATAPI device.  That's good.  And it sees all the
specs about
the disk.
BUT, it's a 2048 bytes/sector device, and Linux doesn't like that at all.
Early in the
initialisation of the driver, it tries to send a 1 KByte request to the
device, and there's
a check in the driver that essentially checks that the request size is a
multiple of
the block size.  And it's not - it's a fraction of it.
What can I do?
Yours in anticipation
Alan Watson
