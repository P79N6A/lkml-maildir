Thank you very much. Yes it works. I tried these kernel parameters:
1) video=gx1fb:mode:1280x1024-16@60,crt:1
  -> CRT was active, 160x64 console
2) video=gx1fb:mode:1024x768-16@60,crt:1
  -> CRT was active, 128x48 console
3) video=gx1fb:mode:800x600-16@60,crt:0,panel:800x600
  -> CRT was disabled, 100x37 console
4) video=gx1fb:mode:1024x768-16@60,crt:0,panel:800x600
  -> CRT was disabled, 80x25 console
Sorry, I have no flatpanel, so I cannot test if the "panel" option works 
correctly. But somethings changes when I tried different values (see 3 and 
4).
Regards
Juergen
