I don't think I saw the answer to my original question.  I assume your
original patch, extended in a way similar to what Christoph has done,
can be made to work to cover both the KVM and GRU (Jack's) case.
XPMEM, however, does not look to be solvable due to the three simultaneous
issues above.  To address that, I think I am coming to the conclusion
that we need an accompanying but seperate pair of callouts.  The first
will ensure the remote page tables and TLBs are cleared and all page
information is returned back to the process that is granting access to
its address space.  That will include an implicit block on the address
range so no further faults will be satisfied by the remote accessor
(forgot the KVM name for this, sorry).  Any faults will be held off
and only the processes page tables/TLBs are in play.  Once the normal
processing of the kernel is complete, an unlock callout would be made
for the range and then faulting may occur on behalf of the process again.
Currently, this is the only direct solution that I can see as a
possibility.  My question is two fold.  Does this seem like a reasonable
means to solve the three simultaneous issues above and if so, does it
seem like the most reasonable means?
Thanks,
Robin
