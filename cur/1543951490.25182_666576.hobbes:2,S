I've not happened across that idiom.  Is that common on

Then the tree should be a bit more of a first class citizen,
IMO, like it is in the clock framework.  Both clock and power
distribution have similar hardware infrastructure; the software
interfaces can be more similar than it is.

Those are the outputs.  Are the inputs visible?  Like batteries
or loosely regulated DC voltages ... drivers/power/* stuff.

In the clock framework, clk_get_parent() exposes one part of this
relationship.  But there's also the association of logical clock
names to devices ...

Right.  clk_enable()/clk_disable() uses a refcounting model for
that stuff; similar.

Right.  But what I was getting at was that there can be
domains hooked up like:
    Power --> Regulator -+-> Switch-1 -+-> Switch-2 --> [Dev-A]
                         |             |
                         |             +-> [Dev-B], [Dev-C]
                         |
                         +-> [Dev-D], [Dev-E]
That is:  five power domains, one regulator:
  - Input power, e.g. a battery
  - Regulator output, maybe configurable
  - Devices D and E share a domain coupled to the regulator
  - Devices B and C share a switched domain
  - Device A has its own switched domain
Those switches can be as simple as a MOSFET under GPIO control.
And I'd expect power domains under Linux to be able to represent
all of those ... including software controls wherevever they're
practical, which in this case might include everything except the
battery input.
