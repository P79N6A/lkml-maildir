Most of the complaints I've gotten are about lack of support for mixed
PSE and non-PSE mappings, not preallocation or performance (generally
its usage doesn't involve creation/destruction cycle performance
requirements, and most of the time they intend to use 100% of the memory).
It's basically too stupid and operating on too small a data set to
screw up performance-wise apart from creation/destruction, which is not
intended to be performant (and will never be; it blits oversized areas).
I wouldn't mind hearing of what you believe is missing, so long as it's
within the constraints of what's mergeable. =(
