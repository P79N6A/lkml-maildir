Hi!
I see that linux-omap still has pretty big difference from
linux-arm... are there any plans at merging them? Is there some way I
could help?
I have bunch of siemens sx1 changes from Vladimir here, and some of
them seem ready to merge... should they be merged with Tony? Or
directly with rmk bringing stuff from -omap tree as needed?
