sparc and s390 are not the only arches lacking atomic_sub_and_test.
Go ahead and send the patches changing all the arches that have it to
define __ARCH_HAS_ATOMIC_SUB_AND_TEST, and add asm-generic/atomic.h
for those that don't etc; but to me that seems like a waste of time -
unless Zam convinces us that Reiser4 will need every last ounce of
cpu on this particular line of code.
