I'm not sure why people are trying to make pigs fly, but if you
really need in-depth information regarding a process or a set
of processes, you should be looking at something that's been
designed from the ground up to actually carry this weight, which
is exactly what LTT is about. Using this approach, all the
accounting gets to be done in user-space. It's like using
"top -q" without the actual disadvantage of killing your system.
