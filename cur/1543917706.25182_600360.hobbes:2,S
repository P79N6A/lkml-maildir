From the Winchip3 (which was the final winchip) specs..
"The IDT WinChip 3 processor also omits the software interface
 to the Intel-proprietary symmetric multiprocessing support: APIC.
 This bus function is omitted since the target market for the
 IDT WinChip 3 processor is typical desktop systems (which
 do not support APIC multiprocessing)."
It didn't offer any alternative DIY-SMP either (or at least
none that's documented).
Centaur only became SMP capable with some of the C3 Nehemiah's
a year or two back.
