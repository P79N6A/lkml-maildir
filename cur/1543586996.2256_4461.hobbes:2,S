Yes, e.g. the raw io device does it using kiovecs. See 
drivers/char/raw.c,fs/iobuf.c et.al. 2.4+zerocopy networking also has a 
different implementation.
The raw.c implementation is not very efficient at the moment though,
mostly because of limitations in the block device layer (but that 
should be no problem for a direct tape driver) 
This work is also in the 2.2 kernels of most distributions.
