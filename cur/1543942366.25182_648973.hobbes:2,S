Subject: tool to keep multiple architectures/kernel configs straight?

Supporting a number of kernels/platforms there are:
     1) common options (which should be all the same across all platforms)
     2) platform/processor specific options
     3) some options are common across kernel versions but not across
        all versions
Is there a good way to maintain this (beyond eyeballing the
.config files?)
