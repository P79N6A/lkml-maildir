I think moving it to user space will add more complexity for
the case where the HW unit is shared with an in in-kernel driver.
Instead of just having a simple char interface to read the data, 
it would require providing a facility for the user space code to 
add commands into the command linked list which seems like more
kernel code to me.
That being said, we can revisit that when actually writing the 
MPC85xx code.
Tnx,
