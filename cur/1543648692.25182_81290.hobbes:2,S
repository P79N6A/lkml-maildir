With the current config system you have to code that way if FOO can be
built in or a module.  What do you mean by this?

With
  dep_tristate '    CSA Job Accounting' CONFIG_CSA_JOB_ACCT $CONFIG_PAGG_JOB
there is no single bool which defines if CONFIG_CSA_JOB_ACCT is set or
not in .config.
There is even source code that needs to know if CONFIG_FOO was set to y
or m, that code needs the existing separation between CONFIG_FOO and
CONFIG_FOO_MODULE.
