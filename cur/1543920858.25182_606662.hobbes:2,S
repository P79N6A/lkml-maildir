Indeed. I think there is certainly likely to be some small overlap, but I 
*think* they are largely independent issues - "do we want choice in 
securitu models" (a very emphatic YES as far as I'm concerned) vs "do we 
necessarily want to do them as out-of-tree modules" (I'd like people who 
actually *do* things like that to educate us on why and what they are 
doing).
Hmm?
