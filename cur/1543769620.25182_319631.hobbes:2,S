Will  knowing it help?  You may find out that you don't have much precision,
but then theres nothing to do about it.  And there may not even be a HZ,
as mentioned.  Less cpu is used if there is no periodic interrupts when
there is nothing to do.  People are trying to *not* have a regular timer
interrupt; instead, a one-shot timer can be programmed for the next
necessary timeout which may very well be quite a few "ticks" into
the future. In this case there is no notion of HZ at all.
