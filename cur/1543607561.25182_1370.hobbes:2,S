It is ok if suid binaries do what they are privileged to. But it is not ok
if unprivileged users do what they want using privileges of those suid
binaries.
Controling qouta is not a user-space task. Kernel should perform some
additional checks before allowing suid binary to write to file descriptor
that is inherited from unprivileged user process.
Good solution is to check CAP_SYS_RESOURCE process's capability when the
file descriptor is opened (just like CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE and
others are checked).
