100% overlap, if I understand the question.  You can't reserve a
single contiguous IO region for use by PCMCIA devices: many are very
specific about where they can be configured.  For memory, things are
generally more flexible, but you would still probably want separate
pools in the 640K-1MB hole and in high memory.
