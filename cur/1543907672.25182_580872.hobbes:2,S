Well, there are more ways that can be achieved.
First, the driver could lock down the block size using
sdio_force_block_size(). Then it knows what it gets.
Second, we could try to make it possible for the driver to indicate
"feel free to pad this transfer". Then we could also remove the need
for drivers to mess with buffers and keep such stuff in the core. We
could even magically remove a memcpy() by setting up two sg entries,
one for the data and one for the padding.

Provided block size < 128. Otherwise it'll jump straight to the byte
transfer.
