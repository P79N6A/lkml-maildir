Unfortunately, it doesn't work, as the lock key is not on the stack. We get
hit by the lockdep code checking if our lock key is static:
      if (!static_obj(key)) {
                printk("BUG: key %p not in .data!\n", key);
                DEBUG_LOCKS_WARN_ON(1);
                return;
        }
So, instead, I propose the following, which does work, and adds runtime
overhead only when LOCKDEP is enabled:
