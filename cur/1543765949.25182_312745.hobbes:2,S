Multimedia apps like JACK and mplayer that use the TSC for high res
timing need to know the CPU speed, and /proc/cpuinfo is the fast way to
get it.
Why don't you create sysfs entries instead?  It would be better to have
all the cpuinfo contents as one value per file anyway (faster
application startup).
