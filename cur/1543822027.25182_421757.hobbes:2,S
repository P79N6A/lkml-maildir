This is *exactly* what we don't want to do!  The whole point of this  
thread is to prevent the need to use /dev/mem and /dev/kmem for  
anything except debugging.

Ewww, I certainly wouldn't trust a binary statically-linked binary  
program that mmaps /dev/mem or /dev/kmem, and I certainly bet that  
90% of the people on this list would feel likewise.  We'd much prefer  
a program which does this:
   #! /bin/sh
   cp firmware.bin /lib/firmware/some_firmware_file.bin
   echo -n eeprom_load_driver >/sys/device/$PCI_ID/bind
   echo -n 1 >/sys/device/$PCI_ID/unbind
Simple, obviously correct, and uses a nice reuseable driver too!

No!  That would be even worse!  You're then having userspace poke at  
the driver while a kernel driver is loaded, which is *exactly* what X  
is getting into trouble for doing.  If you want to add firmware  
update capability, add it to the preexisting primary driver.

No, not an "enable" interface.  In this case the kernel should do  
basically all of the poking at PCI resources for you.  If you  
_really_ want to do that kind of update in userspace, write a stub  
driver which just enables the device on bind, disables it on unbind,  
and mmap and write to the sysfs "rom" file.
