Oh hell ... I remember what's wrong with this whole bit. pfn_valid is
used inconsistently in different places, IIRC. Linus / Andrew ... what
do you actually want it to mean? Some things seem to use it to say
"the memory here is valid accessible RAM", some things "there is a 
valid struct page for this pfn". I was aiming for the latter, but a
few other arches seemed to disagree.
Could I get a ruling on this? ;-)
Thanks,
M.
