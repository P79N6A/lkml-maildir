When writing changelogs, please explain _why_ a change was made, as
well as what the change does.
Coz I'm sitting here wondering if we need this in 2.6.28 and I don't
have all the information.
Looking at it, I guess it does change the userspace interface in minor
ways, so we should merge it into 2.6.28.  Ditto
adt7473-check-inputs-from-sysfs-writes.patch.  Agree?
