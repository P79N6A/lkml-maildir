Nothing in initramfs or userspace tries to load "all the stuff needed
to make open("/dev/console") work". It's the kernel itself, that tries
to resolve its own requirements.
The kernel forked binary _writes_ to /dev/console, if we like it or
not, it seems to do that, and it's arguable why it should not, or how
it should detect that it is not allowed to do that. You may just
depend on the logging of binaries to find other bugs.
The helper was called in the first place for something else, in this
case the "cryptomgr". The loop is caused entirely by the kernel
itself, if /dev/console is just accessed. There is no intentional
loading of any console driver from userspace happening here.
