I'm pretty sure RT_MUTEX_TESTER is the problem, then. It should either
end its threads when testing is no longer needed, or maybe add
try_to_freeze() somewhere inside so that those threads can be frozen.
(BTW.. some mail from me to you may be severely delayed because of
graylist. I send some mail from zaurus over bt over gprs, and
300second is quite a long time for that...)
