Yeah, if you're really worried about the cost of iptables  
manipulations, you should probably write your own happy little C  
program to atomically load, update, and store the rules.  Even then,  
the cost of copying the whole ruleset to userspace for modification  
is probably greater than that of memory allocation issues, especially  
if the ruleset is large enough that memory allocation issues cause  
problems :-D
