This is the same fix ported to i386 for people with Sempron processors
or running i386 kernels on x86_64 systems.
The problems with the earlier disable_timer_pin_1 fix don't seem to happen with
this one; I even booted an old i386 SMP machine with the new boot option
'disable_8254_timer' and it worked fine.
