What we try to achieve is to use the same headerfiles for user,
and kernel. Previously this has been done by including selected
files direct from include/linux/*.
A few cases that I recall is DVB, scsi, and ipv6.
For all of these there were no need to create a specific linux namespace.
If there is parts of the kernel that _really_ require a separate
linux namespace then we need to find a solution for that part.
But we should not try to uglify the interface becasue a limited
part of the kernel interface have specific needs.
And since dvb, scsi and ipv6 could accept current namespace before,
they should also be able to accept it today - no?
The concept introduced by inventing abi/ is to make it visible
what part of the kernel interface is actually visible from user level.
And also a good way for us to make sure no kernel specific types sneaks in.
