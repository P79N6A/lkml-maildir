The PCMCIA code makes me want to vomit. It wants printing out and ritually 
burning, while taking care not to inhale the fumes which might affect your 
brain.

That is the plan.

That is also the plan.
Unfortunately the plan is all we have at the moment, other than a few 
hundred lines of untested core device/driver registration code and untested 
CIS-parsing code. I threw that together hoping it would work like stone 
soup -- but it hasn't worked yet, so it's going to have to wait till I have 
more time to play.
