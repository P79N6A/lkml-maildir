I don't think your emphasis on _existing_ interfaces in the OSS case is
legally relevant, because GPL allows kernel development to fork.  If
someone wants to fork off and go in a different direction, with new
exported symbols and new interfaces for modules, that's their right,
as long as they release their kernel sources and GPL their kernel
changes.  That the reason for the fork is to better support some
proprietary kernel module doesn't seem to be legally relevant.
