I've noticed something on these lines too. I'm running gimp 1.1.18 (which
I had to recompile since the SHM changes), and I've noticed an obvious
slowdown. I.e. When I have part of an image off the screen and back on, it
takes a *LONG* time to redraw. Prior to .99, it was instantaneous (this is
on a PII 400/xfree 4.0/g400).
Is this a know issue or should I start searching for the patch the caused
the problem?
