Heip!
I recently moved to 64-bit kernel, but mixed sounds (ie. mpegs played with 
a media player) don't work with optical S/PDIF connection. AC3/DTS 
passthrough still works, and I can hear the mixed sounds on analog 
connector. And yes, I have unmuted the IEC958 mixer setting.
Tested kernels:
ALSA 1.0.14:
2.6.23.1 32bit: works
2.6.23.1 64bit: broken
2.6.23.12 64bit: broken
2.6.23.12 64bit kernel, 32bit userspace: broken
ALSA 1.0.15:
2.6.24-rc6 64bit: broken (and half of the mixer settings are missing)
The soundcard is integrated to the motherboard (Abit IP35 Pro) and I can't 
find any more information on it than it is "7.1 CH HD Audio CODEC".
Relevant part of dmesg (it is the same for 32/64 bit versions, expect that 
the interrput goes to IRQ 18):

There are no differences in /proc/asound directory entries expect the cards 
file (different IRQ).
Any ideas how to fix this?
