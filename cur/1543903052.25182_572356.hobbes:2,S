I have seen similar behaviour. Once the kernel is compiled with VLAN
support the e1000 driver drops the vlan tag completely even when no
vlans are configured on that port. I would consider this beeing a bug
that enableing a kernel option changes behaviour even if the feature is
not in use.
As i was tracing dot1qinq i could actually see that only the outer
vlan tag was beeing dropped.
