i dont think this is a good idea, this pretty much forces the argument 
passing upon every user of the interface - which argument would be put 
into the worqueue-entry struct anyway.
the code behaves just right when only PREPARE_WORK() is used - the
completion code leaves the entry in a restartable state. A full 
INIT_WORK() is only needed at init time. (or if DECLARE_WORK() was used 
then no INIT_WORK() is needed.) And this is all intentional.

these places should use PREPARE_WORK().
