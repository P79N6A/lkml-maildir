Yes, the idea is good. It would solve ipchains scalability problem wrt number
of devices.

Plans are unknown. Actually, this is a stale field, which was forgotten 8)
I'd add the tag to in_device sysctl list and would not not give
it a special semantics: just an integer number set by administrator
via sysctl and checked by firewall module according to its own rules.
