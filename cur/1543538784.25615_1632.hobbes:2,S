Ok, something in recent kernels has broken GRE stuff again.  I can
generate GRE packets but cannot receive them.  The system receiving the
GRE packets generates a proto 47 unreachable and absorbs the packets in
the INPUT chain.
The last kernel I had with working GRE was test1-pre8.  I am regressing
from test4-pre3 to find where the problem is caused.
