Subject: [PATCH] Fix check for thread being a group leader in memcgroup
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

The check t->pid == t->pid is not the blessed way to check
whether a task is a group leader.
This is not about the code beautifulness only, but about 
pid namespaces fixes - both the tgid and the pid fields on 
the task_struct are (slowly :( ) becoming deprecated.
Besides, the thread_group_leader() macro makes only one
dereference :)
