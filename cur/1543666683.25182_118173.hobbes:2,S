Well, does it _work_ as a built-in? If it does, just send me a patch for 
the Kconfig file. 
A lot of the PCMCIA stuff (16-bit) historically _only_ works as modules,
because the old PCMCIA code depended on module unload to do a lot of the 
cleanups that the regular internal eject handling didn't do. But if that 
driver works for you built-in, then the Kconfig file itself is simply just 
wrong.
