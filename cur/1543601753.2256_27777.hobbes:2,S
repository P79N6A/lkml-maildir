I think that's a redundant check, as all model 6 and 7 Athlon's are
supposed to support SSE, and we already check for that... Unless someone
from AMD would like to correct me..?
However, I should use the cpuid feature flag to check and see if it's
enabled rather than testing that register for 0.  I'm very leary about
that, as it probably smashes other things.  I'll do some more testing
tonight.
For example, I noticed that with my patch, suddenly the APIC is enabled
(shows up in feature flags and kernel goes "BIOS disabled APIC,
reenabling" on boot)..  This is very strange...
