The problem I have with asciidoc is that it's a nightmare to get it
to work. It's what GIT uses, and after spending a whole day trying
to *build* that thing, I finally resigned and asked Junio if he could
publish the pre-formatted manpages himself, which he agreed to.
All I remember is that there was a very deep level of dependencies
through XML craps^H^H^H^H^Hpackages and I don't remember what magic
things, but one full day trying to build something to read a doc is
too much, so I imagine that I would not even have tried that long
if I had wanted to complete a doc and check that my changes looked
right.
Maybe the language is fine, but the tool needs to build first.
