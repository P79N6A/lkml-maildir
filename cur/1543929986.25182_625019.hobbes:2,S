Subject: hidden patch conflict in arch/x86/kernel/cpu/perfctr-watchdog.c

There apparently was an unnoticed conflict between your patch (committed
as 23d5ea5d3edcfe899cd91fca87a4af799bcc5794 2.6.23) and mine
(d1e084746b0e5806e6345ab31c5b370f8dee2b23), which I noticed only now.
I suppose a change like the one below (untested) is needed; before officially
submitting I'd like to confirm this with you.
The issue is the writing of the 'checkbit' member at the end of
setup_intel_arch_watchdog(), which my patch made go to intel_arch_wd_ops
rather than wd_ops.
