Just some food for thought - hitting the power switch on my old Indy
actually performs the equivalent of "shutdown -r now"; the system only cuts
the power when it's done cleaning up (sometimes several minutes later). I
suspect most workstation-class systems do similar things.
Of course this creates a confusing distinction between "pulling the plug"
and "hitting the power switch." Uninformed users might even be more
bewildered by the flurry of disk activity after performing the latter; heck,
I wouldn't blame someone who freaks out and pull the plug to make it stop
=).
Also, such a system obviously has little benefit in the event of an AC power
failure.
