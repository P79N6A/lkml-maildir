   Let me give my point of view.
   Linux trys to scale up to the limits of given hardware.
   That is _*horribly*_ wrong.
   If I have 1GB of memory and my applications for use only 16MB - it 
doesn't mean I want to fill 1GB-16MB with garbage like file my momy had 
viewed two weeks ago.
   That's it: OS should scale for *application* *needs*.
   Can you compare in your mind overhead of managing 1GB of cache with 
managing e.g. 16MB of cache?
   So IMHO problem is: OS needless overhead.
   It is possible to minimize overhead in several ways:
   1) Optimize algorithms and data structures.
   2) Minimize amount of resources.
   3) As a compromise of 1&2 - teach OS to not use unneeded resource til 
the time they will be really needed, and free them afterwards.
   1) is already done, 3) is awful heuristics which will never work 
reliably.
   And Takao's patch was trying to approach problem from 2) point.
   So as for me it is justified.
   Comments are welcome.
