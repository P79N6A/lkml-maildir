It is unclear to me whether this patch series replaces, augments or
conflicts with your earlier patch series starting with "taskstats: separate
PID/TGID stats producers to complete the TGID ones".
But it doesn't matter much - I think I'll duck both patch series for now. 
The gap between mainline and -mm is so large that it is becoming
unmanageable so let's concentrate on the review and stabilisation work for
now please, rather than adding more stuff.
Also, I don't think we're seeing enough review and test from people on
these patch series - I don't have time to do it all.  (Well, apparently I
do, but I don't think it's a good situation).
