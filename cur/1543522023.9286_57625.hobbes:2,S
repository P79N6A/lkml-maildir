This is the sort of thing that the e820 report is designed to handle.  Linux
2.2 assumes that all "high" memory is in one continuous chunk from 1 meg -
EOM.  I one of my home systems has 32M, and I was running with 15M for
months before noticing the problem.  Turn the 15-16M hole off, and Linux 2.2
can see past it.
But it still won't see past the int-15/88 limit of 64M if your bios doesn't
support e801 reporting.

I have found that there is a setting in my BIOS, that says something like
< 64 MB RAM
and the options are 1) OS2
                             2) NON OS2
When the setting is changed to NON OS2, my computer only recognises 14 MB of
RAM. But When OS2 is selected, the computer recognises all 192 MB (if I have
the mem=192M parameter appened).
Maybe this has something to do with the 14 mb problem?
Daniel.
