Hi Greg, all,
As the new-style class devices (as opposed to old-style struct
class_device) are becoming more widely used, I noticed that the
dev_printk-based functions are not working properly with these.
New-style class devices have no driver nor bus, almost by definition,
and as a result dev_driver_string(), which is used as the first
parameter of dev_printk, resolves to an empty string. This causes
entries like the following to show in my logs:
 i2c-2: adapter [SMBus stub driver] registered
Notice the unaesthetical leading whitespace. In order to fix this
problem, I suggest that we extend dev_driver_string to deal with
new-style class devices:

In the case above, the message in the logs now looks like:

Which is much better IMHO. Greg, what do you think?
Thanks,
