Well, if it really is just his hobby, then he shouldn't be chanting the "World
Domination" mantra.  Either Linux belongs to Linus, in which case it's
irrelevant outside his personal world, or it is a tool for all computer users.
If Linus really doesn't care who uses his OS, then he should not be encouraging
community participation, and he shouldn't be accepting speaking engagements at
major conventions where business users attend to decide whether Linux is for
them or not.
