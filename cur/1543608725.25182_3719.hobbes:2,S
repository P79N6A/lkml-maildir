I think the core insight is that if the kernel continues to have dozens of 
"human-readable" file formats in /proc, each should to be documented using a 
BNF description that can guarantee that the format is still valid in the 
future, even if there is the need to add additional fields. 
The result of this is, of course, that it may be very hard to write 
shell scripts that won't break sooner or later and that accessing the data in 
C is much more work than a simple scanf.
