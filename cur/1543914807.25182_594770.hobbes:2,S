Nice it works for you too !

Symmetry is not broken, as we have :
#define subsys_initcall(fn)             module_init(fn)
in include/linux/init.h where compiling as a module, and when not compiling
as a module, I doubt the exit function is called unless you are shuting
down your machine...

Good point ! I expect the patches to be already in some queue waiting to be
pulled !
