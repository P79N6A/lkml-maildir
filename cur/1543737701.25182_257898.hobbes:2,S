So there's exactly one copy of that string in use, agreeing with itself.
Also, so strncmp() can be used.  It won't matter if the sysadmin goes
   echo -n enabled > wakeup
   echo enabled > wakeup
I'd personally rather use "on" and "off", but there seems to be
a convention in /proc/acpi/wakeup in favor of polysyllabicism.

Except that's two words, not one, which will make shell script
bugs happen more readily.  I thought about "(none)" which
has the same issue, and "-".  But I figured that if it were very
important, a good solution would appear ... ;)
