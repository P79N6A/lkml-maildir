I need to take a look but I thikn there are two features I can remove
without too much trouble: counter remapping, explicit set switching.
That would remove some code and should they really be needed in the
future we could add them.

The issue is that the code get more difficult to read and format
because of all the (unsigned long *) cast. What about I rename the
macro to cast_ulp() to make this more explicit?

No, monitoring will stop when the queue is full.

What I did (this is how it works on IA-64) is that Oprofile works on top
of perfmon.  Perfmon handles read/write of the PMU registers and low-level
interrupt handling. Higher level interrupt handling, sampling buffers, event
buffers and export of the buffer via /dev/oprofile works like before.
Until the user level oprofile code gets updated to work on perfmon
on x86, we could do what you suggest. Mutual exclusion between the
two subsystem would not be too hard.

The pfm_read_Pmds() call takes a vector argument, the /sys info simply reports
the maximum number of entries in the vector that would not cause a kmalloc() 
but instead would be handled on the kernel stack. On x86, it is set to 4.
so if you have 8 register to read, it may be more interesting to make two
calls of 4 entries each. This is purely for optimization.

Agreed.

The kernel level sampling buffer is allocated via kmalloc() when the 
perfmon context is created. The buffer cannot be paged out, so this is 
as if the memory was locked. I do the accounting with RLIMIT_MEMLOCK,
even if the buffer is never explicitly mmapped by the user.
Don't you need some privilege to issue a mlock()?
So in fact you have two levels: a per-process limit controlled
by RLIMIT_MEMLOCK and a system-wide limit controlled by smpl_buffer_mem_max.
