Actually, I walk from the source inode down to try to find the
target inode. If not found, this is not attempting to create a loop.
Should be obvious that the average case is much less than the
whole tree.

mv /a/b/c/d ../../w/z/b is implemented as this in the filesystem:
ln /a/b/c/d ../../w/z/b && rm /a/b/c/d
So what it's going to do is try to find z under /a/b/c/d.
Oh, and Nakita's right about the NFS server stuff. Actually, I think
the current filesystem I use for this is totally incompatible with
NFS (cannot call d_splice_alias on directory dnodes) so that
doesn't concern me.
