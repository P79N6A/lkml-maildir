note that async request and response rings are implemented already in 
essence: that's how FIO uses syslets. The linked list of syslet atoms is 
the 'request ring' (it's just that 'ring' is not a hard-enforced data 
structure - you can use other request formats too), and the completion 
ring is the 'response ring'.
