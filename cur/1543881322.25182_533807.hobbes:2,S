So you mean make alloc_bootmem make sure there's a mapping for the
returned page?  That would be simple enough, though it might interact
strangely with the actual construction of the memory mappings (what if
the page alloc_bootmem just allocated for the pagetable is the page
pagetable_init is actually trying to map?).
I'm not sure about the issue with holes.  I assume you mean that just
because head.S maps a chunk of memory, it isn't necessarily available
for allocation because its a hole.  But does alloc_bootmem know to avoid
them anyway?  Has it already parsed e820 at that point?
