/etc/fstab is not available until after the kernel mounts the root
filesystem, so what is in /etc/fstab is totally irrelevant here.
If you don't simultaneously crash your system running ext3, and then reboot
into a kernel which does not support ext3 you will be fine.  A clean
shutdown will clear the "needs_recovery" flag (and any ext2-only kernel
can blissfully use that filesystem), any ext3-aware kernel can also
mount it again and do a journal flush, or any modern (last year or two)
e2fsck will clean it up too (from a rescue disk if desparate).
Cheers, Andreas
