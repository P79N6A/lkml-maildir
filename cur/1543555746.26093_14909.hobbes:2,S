Good idea; unfortunately, it's probably too kernel-specific, so gcc may not
want to include this change. Also, the kernel is gcc version-specific; even if
this feature were automated in gcc now, it could take some time before the
kernel could safely be built under that version. Better to optimise the source
code to avoid the problem, rather than change the compiler to kludge around it.
