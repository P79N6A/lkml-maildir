Very real issue. Your IDE and SCSI disks may randomly leave recoverable
data around if they hit a block that is iffy and mark it bad before it
fails. Flash file systems are very very likely to leave old data around
but fortunately are much smaller and therefore easy to encrypt or blank
wholesale (or indeed blowtorch erase 8))
