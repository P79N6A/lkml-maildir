Well, interrupts (irq's) and signals are quite different beasts. 
Interrupts are notifications that hardware components send to the processor
(and thus to the driver software) to draw attention to specific events.
Signals (in a Unix context) are notifications the operation system (or some
other source) sends to a process. They have nothing in common, except
perhaps - they have numbers :-)
see 'man 7 signal' for infos about the latter.
sig 11 informs a process that it attempted to access unavailable/invalid
memory or similar. That can be caused by either: a broken program, or (more
probably when 'supposed to be well tested' programs are affected): 
broken hardware (overclocked system, bad memory/processor/mainboard/pci....)

again: raised signals are no irq-conflicts
