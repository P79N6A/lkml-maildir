Well, you'd have to re-design the networking code to support NUMA
architectures, with a fairly fine granularity. I'm not sure you'd gain
anything except possibly for the forwarding fast path.
A cheaper, and probably more useful possibility is hardware assistance for
specific operations. E.g. hardware-accelerated packet classification looks
interesting. I'd also like to see hardware-assistance for shaping on other
media than ATM.
