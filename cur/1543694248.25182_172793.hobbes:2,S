I expect there are at least a few applications that will misbehave because
the developers did not expect a timer to behave this way (regardless of
whether it's proper according to the spec).
Is it possible to choose a timer resolution that errs on the high side of
1ms instead of the low side? [*]  It seems to me that would result in the
application getting very close to the expected number of alarm signals.  I
am not at all familiar with the kernel design so I don't know if this would
be feasible or not.
[*] If this is the 8254 timer, using 1192 as a divisor should result in a
resolution of ~1,000,686 nanoseconds.

immortality for me.
