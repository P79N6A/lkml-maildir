Well, then, you have a problem: how to handle ties?  Consider a system
with no extra precision, and one-second time resolution.  You see an .o
file and a .c file that are the same age.  Rebuild or not?  If we don't
and are wrong, the .o file is bad.  If we do and are wrong, the target
will be modified while some process is trying to use it.  Somehow we
have to figure out how to do the makefile so that neither problem can
occur.
In your particular case, for example, if the command to rebuild cc1 builds
the new version in a different place, then does an mv, the rebuild *will*
be harmless.
