So we need to find a way to provide putcs() and font operations by a fbdev,
without sucking in the whole fbcon layer.
Basically you need putcs(), which is really just a simple way to do multiple
image blits in one call, and set_font(), right? And if the fbdev doesn't
provide those, we must fallback to accel_putcs().
James (and Petr, of course), what do you think? And I guess this will make
Davem happy as well.
