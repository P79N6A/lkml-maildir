Thanks :-)

Note that the deadline i/o scheduler only considers deadlines on
individual requests so far, so there's no real guarentee that process X,
Y, and Z will receive equal share of the bandwidth. This is something
I'm thinking about, though.
My testing does seem to indicate that the deadline scheduler is fairer
than the linus scheduler, but ymmv.

:/
I'll say that 2.5.29 IDE did work fine for the testing I did with the
deadline scheduler, at least it survived a dbench 64 (that's about the
testing it got).
