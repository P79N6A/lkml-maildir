I did have the same problem with an SMP Intel 440LX which run without any
problem since 1998. When I installed 2.2.18 it could run for more than 5
minutes (Alan suggested me it was .
I am not sure it's a RAM poblem, because it never gave/gives a SEGFAULT
compiling the kernel. I brought it back to 2.2.16 and it's running happy.
Could be some SMP/BIOS related problem? If it's the RAM or chipset, I am
scared how we could use it for three years and suddenly it hangs with a new
version of the kernel... Blame to Intel?
