Dear Heinz Deinhart,
>The old Athlon reads: 
>        A1133AMS3C 
>        AVIA 0115TPAW 
>        95262550081 
>
>The new (non working) one: 
>        A1200AMS3C 
>        AXIA 0121RPDW 
>        95987660990 
The first line can be decoded using AMDs documentation at

In particular
       A 1133 A M S 3 C
       |   |  | | | | |
       |   |  | | | |  \___ FSB (B=200, C=266)
       |   |  | | |  \_____ Size of L2 Cache (3=256K)
       |   |  | |  \_______ Case Temperature (S=95C, T=90C)
       |   |  |  \_________ Operating Voltage (M=1.75V, P=1.7V)
       |   |   \___________ Package Type (A=PGA)
       |    \______________ Speed in MHz
        \__________________ A for Athlon
Anyone know what the second line means?  It is quite mysterious 
that the word VIA appears on the chip that works with VIA KT133A 
and not on the other :-)
Have you tried Robert Redelmeier's new program burnMMX2 which has 
the 3DNow streaming cache bypass load/store instructions that seem 
to be causing all the trouble?
Does it run indefinitely or terminate with the 1133MHz processor 
configuration?  What about for the 1200MHz processor with kernel 
optimization turned off?
