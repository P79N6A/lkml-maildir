How exactly do you define forever? It looks to me, that this condition
never resolves on its own, at least not in a window of several hours
(the system used to get stuck around 3am and was normally rebooted
between 7am and 8am, so at least hours are not enough to have the problem
resolve on its own).

Unfortunately I have no idea. The full stacktrace for all processes was
attached to the original bugreport, maybe that can give a clue to that.

Not sure about that. The system is responsible on a still open SSH
session, allowing several tasks still to be executed. However, that SSH
session gets stuck very fast if the wrong commands are executed. New
logins are not possible (Connection is akzepted but resulting in a
timeout 60 seconds later, so most likely /bin/login is not able to log
into wtmp).
From all that I suspect that there is no more write activity on that
system, but cannot say for sure.

I did not, no.
