Quite so.  Now, ability to _remove_ capabilities on exec() is a Good Thing(tm)
regardless of suid.  It can be combined with suid - that gives you something
that is still evil, but less than it used to be.  But I don't see any point
in new independent mechanism for raising caps - e.g. since it assumes a
bunch of new programs that were written to run with elevated caps and
with assumption that they will be less dangerous than suid-root ones.
Somehow, it doesn't make me happy about running such programs - not for
first 5 years or so.
