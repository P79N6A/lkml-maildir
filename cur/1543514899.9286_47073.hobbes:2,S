Wow. Cool.
I had totally given up on getting a working framebuffer, what with my puny
old VESA 1.3 BIOS.. Yet i managed to get the spiffy boot logo :)
The only annoying thing is it occasionally 'stalls' for a second or two
(monitor drops into powersaving mode) when changing between VC's, before
coming back, leaving the following message in the syslog:
Nov  2 21:05:57 xfiles kernel: TRIO driver: Unsupported clock freq
