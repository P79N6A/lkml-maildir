I think I have to agree with both Steve and Mike here.
While it doesn't make sense to put 'A $50
modem in a $200 computer ...' as Steve put it, (I have a good zoom modem that
cost me $110 about 6 months ago...) , it also doesn't make sense to encourage
companies to make underpowered, crippled parts. 
What needs to be done is convince companies that we want their hardware, high
quality modems - but at  a more reasonable price. 
If we encourage manufacturers to make us subpar hardware for linux, where is
that going to leave us in 5 or 10 years?...
