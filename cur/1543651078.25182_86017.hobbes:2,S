yep lock addl $0, mem  with the appropriate kmaps so it will work on any system
I use.  It isn't rocket science but since it is using kmap_atomic that function
at least should probably get in the kernel.

Polling the memory controller periodically isn't hard, and you can usually
get an interrupt as well.  Though I have not explored the whole interrupt
territory.  Finding out when you have a corrected error is extremely useful
as it gives a warning that your memory is going bad.  Just like with a disk
getting a bunch of errors means it is time to be replaced, but you still
have a little time left.

If it is your kernel text space that is getting the error there will
be no next write.
Beyond that if you are trying to see if the multiple correctable errors
you have are a single error, or an actual problem software scrubbing helps.
Because then you know the second report was because the problem reoccured.
Making it likely you have a bad bit in your DIMM.
