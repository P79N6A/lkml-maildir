Right, that's the plan.  If something changes from one day to the next,
then it will be submitted immediatly.  Right now I'm in that stage of
building a "stable" foundation.  It could probably use some tweaking to
the .config and other things to introduce a higher likelyhood of finding
problems from one day to the next, but I don't want to be constantly
just finding things that everyone is already aware of.  Any suggestions
wrt this are welcome.
