Subject: Amanda VFAT Incremental Backups Broken in linux-2.2.1[12]

I think I have found an issue with recent vfat drivers under Linux.
I have a few FAT16 and FAT32 partitions mounted read-only on my systems.
These seldom get booted into, or read/written.
Everything worked fine in 2.2.10 and before.
I first saw this problem in 2.2.11, and backed out.
I am now on 2.2.12 and the problem is still here.
Sorry for not reporting the problem earlier.
With the newer kernels, all my vfat partitions will not backup
incrementally.  Everything gets dumped even though the dump level is
above zero.  I am using GNUTAR as the backup method.  AFAIK, nothing has
changed on my systems except kernel upgrades.
This is very similar to a problem I saw earlier this year with *non*
vfat partitions where ATIME stamps were being reset on the filesystem
every time amanda pounded through it.
All my ext2 filesystems are unaffected by this issue.  I don't have any
other disk filesystems, so I don't know if any more are affected.
I really don't want to back out to 2.2.10 to fix this this time.
I have remounted all my vfat partitions with "noatime" for tonight's run.
I will follow up with success/failure stories.
Help!
My system configuration:
o debian-2.1 (a.k.a. Hamm)
o amanda-2.4.1p1 (Built and installed since May, worked great!)
o tar-1.12-7 (Standard package for Debian-2.1)
