I had thought of it. But later decided to retain the same code as 2.6.18-rc4,
where there was no lock_cpu_hotplug surrounding for_each_online_cpu.
Furthermore, it did not create any problems with the test run.
So I thought *may-be* we don't need it. 
But looks like I need to investigate further.
Thanks for pointing it out.
