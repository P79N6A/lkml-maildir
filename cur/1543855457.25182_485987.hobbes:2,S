Does anyone know where I can find documentation on the page coloring  
algorithm?  I just need to find out the the basic heuristics used in  
coloring the pages.
Also, does the kernel source include the page coloring code or do I  
need to patch the kernel?
I would appreciate being CC'ed on any response/comments related to  
this post.
Thanks.
