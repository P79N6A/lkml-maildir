Subject: RE: [ACPI] [PATCH][RFC] fix ACPI IRQ routing after S3 suspend

Right, this looks like the problem I encounter. My current test shows that the problem only occurs if ACPI changed LINK devices' IRQ. If ACPI use default LINK device IRQ, the problem went off.
Currently there are two workarounds:
1. comment one line in pci_link.c:acpi_pci_link_allocate, like below
	/*
	 * forget active IRQ that is not in possible list
	 */
	if (i == link->irq.possible_count) {
		if (acpi_strict)
			printk(KERN_WARNING PREFIX "_CRS %d not found"
				" in _PRS\n", link->irq.active);
+//		link->irq.active = 0;
	}
This disables rebalance IRQ, which fixes my problem.
2. change 'device_initcall(i8259A_init_sysfs);' to 'late_initcall(i8259A_init_sysfs);'
It seems that if OS changed BIOS IRQ router setting (like ACPI change Link device setting), IRQ router should resume before PIC. This possibly proves what Venki said.
PS. For the resume order, isn't it strange Local APIC resumes after PIT? I guess it should be the first device to resume.
Thanks,
Shaohua
