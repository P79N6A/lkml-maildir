Subject: 2.4 foreign modules - proc_register() gone ?

I'm in the process of migrating my foreign modules to 2.4,
and it now appears that proc_register() and proc_unregister()
are no longer exported from the kernel.  Bug or feature?
I know that Linus reserves the right to change interfaces,
but I couldn't find any mention in the archives of deleting
this, presumably in favor of create_proc_entry().  Or maybe
we should just go back to using ioctl()? :)
