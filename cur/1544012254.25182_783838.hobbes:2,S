It shouldn't be but I agree with you, it smells bad. Can you report that
again on the linuxppc-dev@ozlabs.org mailing list ? Along with
instructions to d/l, install & run the minimum repro-case ? I'll try to
give it a go on different ppc64 machines as soon as I'm over my upcoming
xmas hangover :-) If it appears to be ps3 specific, we can work with
Geoff Levand (PS3 maintainer for Sony) to try to identify the root cause
and fix it.
Cheers,
