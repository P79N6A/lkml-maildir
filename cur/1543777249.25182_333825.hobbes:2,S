Subject: [PATCH] Use read_timer_tsc only when CPU has TSC
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Only use read_timer_tsc only when CPU has TSC. Thanks to Andrea for 
pointing this out. Should not be issue on any platforms as all
recent systems that has HPET also has CPUs that supports TSC. The patch is
still required for correctness.
