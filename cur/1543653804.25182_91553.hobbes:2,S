You don't need the system calls, you can just call the in-kernel
functions directly. If one of the functions you want isn't exported
you could either use an exported alternative or export it yourself
by patching your kernel.  However, chances are that if it's not
exported it'll be changed or gone 10 kernels down the line, so you
don't want to use it anyway. ;)

Yes. This is absolutely impossible.
Think of the kernel as a shared library, a shared library that
causes the process that calls a function from it to switch into
supervisor mode.
