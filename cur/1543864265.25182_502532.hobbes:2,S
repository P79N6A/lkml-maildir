Okay, I stand corrected.

Do I understand correctly that you:
- save the LRU,
- copy data into them,
- compute MD5 checksums of their contents,
- save the image,
- suspend,
- resume,
- load the image,
- compute MD5 checksums of the loaded data,
and the sums computed before saving the image and after loading it may differ
for up to 20 pages?
