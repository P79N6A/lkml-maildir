And you just shot yourself in the foot, majorly, because you tested
for NULLness and then took the action you anticipated might have been
appropriate, which really it wasn't, and you allowed a kernel with
now-corrupt data structures to continue to run.
This is bad.  This is extrememly bad.  And your "forward thinking"
*caused* it.
A null pointer dereference in the kernel is fatal for a reason.  It
indicates that there are interfaces that aren't consistent, and your
data structures are now completely unreliable.
