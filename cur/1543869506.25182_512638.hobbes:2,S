Well, the rules could be setup so that the storage path will never hit
the queue.

Indeed, this patch will just warn the user that he did something very
wrong and should avoid this situation.
Perhaps skipping is not the proper action, but dropping them will most
certainly freeze the box. Either way seems unlucky. Might as well stick
BUG() in there :-(.
Any ideas on how to resolve this are most welcome, detecting the
situation on either rule insert or swapon and failing the respective
action would be most ideal, but I have no idea if that is feasible.
