I __finally__ got back on "the list". They finally fixed the
company firewall!
During my absence, I had the chance to look at some SMP code
because of a performance problem (a few microseconds out of
spec on a 130 MHz embedded system) and I have a question about
the current spin-locks.
Spin-locks now transfer control to the .text.lock segment.
This is a separate segment that can be at an offset that
is far away from the currently executing code. That may
cause the cache to be reloaded. Further, each spin-lock
invocation generates separate code within that segment.
Question 1: Why?
Question 2: What is the purpose of the code sequence, "repz nop" 
generated by the spin-lock code? Is this a processor BUG work-around?
`as` doesn't "like" this sequence and, Intel doesn't seem to
document it.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
