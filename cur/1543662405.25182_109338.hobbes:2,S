It would be nice if that were true, but back here in reality things are
rarely if ever even stable enough for testing if they merely build and
boot.
If Linus really is building and booting every kernel prior to release,
it would be quick and simple to add a fast subset of LTP to the mix and
do a quick regression run.  It's convenient, fast and could save a lot
of headaches for a lot of people later on.
