           Summary: CONFIG_INPUT should be "y" by default
    Kernel Version: 2.5.66
            Status: NEW
          Severity: normal
             Owner: vojtech@suse.cz
         Submitter: michael.wardle@adacel.com
Problem Description:
When attempting to build a 2.5.66 kernel, CONFIG_INPUT is "m" by default.  This
hides configuration items such as CONFIG_VT, without which the new kernel will
not have a console.  As a working console is a basic feature that I expect most
users will want, I suggest both CONFIG_INPUT and CONFIG_VT be "y" by default.
---------------------------- NOTE -----------------------
Above was the bug as filed.
CONFIG_INPUT and CONFIG_VT *do* default to y.
Unfortunately 2.4 configs have CONFIG_INPUT disabled, which overrides
the default ;-( This is breaking far too many people ... we really 
need to do something like make CONFIG_INPUT_DISABLE and flip the 
logic instead, so people stop tripping over this. Too much upgrade
pain.
