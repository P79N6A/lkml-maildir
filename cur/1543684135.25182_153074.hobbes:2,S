Ok, you got me confused (thankfully I didn't submit anything for inclusion
yet. :)
Initially, Andi said:

To which I replied:

But you pointed out it was the other way around:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=105947532631384&w=2

And Andi agreed:

So I proposed (blindly exchanging the numbers):
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=105950174531125&w=2
> +For x86-64, the needed APIC is always compiled in, and the NMI watchdog is

So... Should it be something like:
+For x86-64, the needed APIC is always compiled in, and the NMI watchdog is
+always enabled with perctr mode. Currently, mode=2 (local APIC) does not
+work on x86-64. IO APIC mode (mode=1) is the default. Using NMI watchdog
+(mode=1) needs the first performance register, so you can't use it for
+other purposes (such as high precision performance profiling.)
(Is the last sentence only valid for x86-64?)
