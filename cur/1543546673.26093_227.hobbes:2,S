It is a part of the kernel.  When you configure your kernel, (make
menuconfig)
go into the "Loadable module support" menu.  Select
"Enable loadable module support" and "Kernel module loader", the latter
one
is kmod.
kmod will be compiled into the kernel, there is no extra module for it.
You'll want to have modutils installed of course.
