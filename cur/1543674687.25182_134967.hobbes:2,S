Stephen,
Justin is right, you should run it through the NMI watchdog, in the hope to
find something useful. If it hangs again in 14 days, you won't know why and
that may be frustrating. With the NMI watchdog, you at least have a chance to
see where it locks up, and you may find it to be within the driver, which would
help Justin stabilize it, or within any other kernel subsystem.
I had to use nmi_watchdog=2 at boot time, but other people use 1.
Regards,
Willy
