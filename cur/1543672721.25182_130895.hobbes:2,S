Sure.  But exactly that information is not contained in the manpage (as
of Debians 3.2.3).  I guess I'll have to dig deeper.

Oh, kernprof was too advanced already.  It basically worked out of the
box for me, porting it to ppc took maybe one hour, not counting a
linker problem that was loosely related to that patch.  Never bothered
to really understand what it does. :(

If I read this correctly, your patch doesn't catch everything, if
there are functions remaining that use stack frames >0x200ul.  Ok,
tell me I'm wrong and should go through the assembler code first.
