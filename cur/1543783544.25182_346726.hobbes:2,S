All are legitimate uses. The partition table tells you which.

You installed it on Red Hat 7 ? I think 7, may have been 6.x or earlier.
This behaviour goes back pretty much to the creation of the ATA spec for
HPA. In fact if it was that long ago IBM shipped it with Windows so it
did have a partition table!

Not really practical. You'd have to list most older PC systems.

"Wrong" is a poor term here.
If the system has a partition table that doesn't cover the post HPA area
and its about the right size we can be fairly sure the right choice is
to honour the HPA, if its a randomly different size its a fair bet the
disk got moved
If the partition table exceeds the no HPA area of disk but not the full
disk then its almost certainly right the HPA should be disabled post
boot. If it exceeds both its a raid 0 volume of some form...
