With the example you would need to place task m in one container called 
A_m and tasks n and o in another container called A_n,o.  Then join A_m to 
D, A_n,o to E, and both to G.
I agree that this doesn't appear to be very easy to setup by the sysadmin 
or any automated means.  But in terms of the kernel, each of these tasks 
would have a pointer back to its container and that container would point 
to its assigned resource controller.  So it's still a double dereference 
to access the controller from any task_struct.
So if we proposed a hierarchy of containers, we could have the following:
			----------A----------
			|         |         |
		   -----B-----	  m    -----C------
		   |         |         |
		   n    -----D-----    o
			|	  |
			p         q
So instead we make the requirement that only one container can be attached 
to any given controller.  So if container A is attached to a disk I/O 
controller, for example, then it includes all processes.  If D is attached 
to it instead, only p and q are affected by its constraints.
This would be possible by adding a field to the struct container that 
would point to its parent cpu, net, mem, etc. container or NULL if it is 
itself.
The difference:
	Single-level container hierarchy
		struct task_struct {
			...
			struct container *my_container;
		}
		struct container {
			...
			struct controller *my_cpu_controller;
			struct controller *my_mem_controller;
		}
	Multi-level container hierarchy
		struct task_struct {
			...
			struct container *my_container;
		}
		struct container {
			...
			/* Root containers, NULL if itself */
			struct container *my_cpu_root_container;
			struct container *my_mem_root_container;
			/* Controllers, NULL if has parent */
			struct controller *my_cpu_controller;
			struct controller *my_mem_controller;
		}
This eliminates the need to put a pointer to each resource controller 
within each task_struct.

Yes, and that was the requirement that the above example was based upon.
