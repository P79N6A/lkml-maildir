Hi all
I have just installed SuSE 6.2 on my computer.  Everything's fine but I
have problems to have a SMC EtherEZ PCI working properly.  As usual, this
is a fully compatible NE2000 and is easily recognized a so....(In fact
this is a clone of Realtek 8029 compatible with NE2000)  Neverthless, I
cannot use internet at all.  It seems to be a problem with dhcp client.
I have learn that dhcp client on SuSE distributions is a poor DHCP tool
(it seems to be!).  So I got dhcpcd 1.3.17, I have installed it correctly,
but I don't know how to run it from the start.
A news group that I saw suggests to change a line in /sbin/ifup to run
dhcpcd.... but I don't have such a file with SuSE 6.2!!  All I have is
ifconfig but that is not the desired file.
Another one suggests to change /etc/rc.d/rc.inet1 to run dhcpcd from the
start, but I don have it in this directory.  I have it on a directory
where I unzipped dhcpcd.tar.gz!!!
I also tried to change parameters in rc.config...I changed dhcpclient of
SuSE into dhcpcd in the network configuration section.....itdoesn't seem
to be that bad because I get some messages while booting the system saying
that there have missing options to the command line, but I can't see what
it is it goes too fast for my eyes...
Does anybody have a little hint for me please???
thanks....
