No - I suspect that we're not actually doing all that much IO at all, and
the real reason for the lock-up is just that the current algorithm is so
bad that when it starts to act exponentially worse it really _is_ taking
minutes of CPU time following pointers and generally not being very nice
on the CPU cache etc..
The bulk of the work is walking the process page tables thousands and
thousands of times. Expensive.

Agreed. I already talked in private with some people about just
re-visiting the issue of the lazy de-allocation. It has nice properties,
but it certainly appears as if the nasty cases just plain outweigh the
advantages.
