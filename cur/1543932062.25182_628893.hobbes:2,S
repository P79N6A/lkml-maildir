If this is a mac80211 related problem, then other systems connecting
to the same ap and using mac80211 would also be affected? Like I said
earlier, there are five machines connecting to this ap, and I just
realized one of them has a ralink card that uses the rt2x00 driver,
which I believe is mac80211. That system doesn't have this problem,
which leads me to believe it may not be mac80211 after all, although I
wouldn't rule it out.
