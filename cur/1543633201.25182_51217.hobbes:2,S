How about we remove these alltogether?  The ncr53c8xx and sym-2 drivers
both support the 53c810, 53c825, and 53c820 devices and there's a 'common'
53c7xx backend which handles the 53c700, 53x700-66 53c710 and 53c720
chipsets that the 53c7,8xx driver handles.  The only minor issue is that
if there's any ISA (PCI?) cards with these chipsets would need a new
front-end to detect the cards.
