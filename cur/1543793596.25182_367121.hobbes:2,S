This makes sense.  Each PRB slot in the card's RAM only contains 
something useful after you have submitted a PRB, and had some results 
returned.

10 seconds is certainly a long time.
grep for msleep(150) in libata code, though.

I suppose no-flag is the right answer, then...

Standard init sequence includes checking SStatus, then if a device is 
present, waiting until Port Ready (bit 31) of PORT_CTRL_STAT is set.  It 
doesn't look like sata_sil24 does that.

The port stops, when any error occurs.  For device errors, set 
PORT_CS_INIT bit in PORT_CTRL_STAT, then wait for Port Ready (bit 31, 
see above).

AFAICS, you _must_ send a soft reset PRB.  This will be needed anyway, 
for port multiplier support.

Assert PORT_CS_INIT, then wait for Port Ready.  __ONLY__ do this for 
errors PORT_CERR_DEV and PORT_CERR_SDB.
