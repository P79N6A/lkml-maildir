MAP_NR_DENSE()-based zone-relative pfn to zone->zone_mem_map index
remapping is designed to handle this (and actually more severe
situations). The only constraint is that pfn's must be monotonically
increasing with ->zone_mem_map index. Some non-i386 architectures
virtually remap physical memory to provide the illusion of contiguity
of kernel virtual memory, but in a mature port (e.g. i386) there's high
risk of breaking numerous preexisting drivers.
