This HELP (taken from linux/drivers/scsi/Kconfig) is quite explicit:
config BLK_DEV_SD
        tristate "SCSI disk support"
        depends on SCSI
        ---help---
          If you want to use SCSI hard disks, Fibre Channel disks,
          USB storage or the SCSI or parallel port version of
          the IOMEGA ZIP drive, say Y and read the SCSI-HOWTO,
          the Disk-HOWTO and the Multi-Disk-HOWTO, available from
          <
http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.
 This is NOT for SCSI
          CD-ROMs.
So if you want to use USB Mass Storage devices (that use SCSI emulation) you 
need also SCSI disk support (I have realized it when I've tried to mount 
one those USB devices, without success).
