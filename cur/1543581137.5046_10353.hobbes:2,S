one issue is allocation overhead. The fragment array is a natural and
constant-size part of an skb, thus we get all the control structures in
place while allocating a structure that we have to allocate anyway.
another issue is that certain cards have (or can have) SG-limits, so we
have to be prepared to have a 'limited' array of fragments anyway, and
have to be prepared to split/refragment packets. Whether there is a global
MAX_SKB_FRAGS limit or not makes no difference.
