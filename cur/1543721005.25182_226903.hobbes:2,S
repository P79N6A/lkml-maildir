I wonder what kind of resolution is needed. I'd love for timers to just be
in "absolute time" using some fixed point arith, and then when the timer
queue gets run you look at the current time and run all the ones that
expired so far. That way you can make the HZ timer irq run this list, but if
it's cheap enough and you then want higher accuracy, also the RTC clock, and
potentially even some oddball thing like the idle loop or network interrupts
for network timers, or video vsync irqs or .. or ..
