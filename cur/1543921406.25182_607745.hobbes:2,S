Try with "-p".
It's possible (nay, likely) that "next" has the bug where "--follow" 
without a patch generating thing (-p or --stat or one of the other flags 
that enable diffs) doesn't work at all.
It should be fixed in "master".
Sadly, Junio has been away for personal reasons for two weeks, so we 
haven't had that known bug fixed in the regular git tree. Shawn Pearce 
maintains a repo with known fixes at "git://repo.or.cz/git/spearce.git" in 
the meantime.
