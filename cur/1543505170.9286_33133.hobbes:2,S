Subject: How to "convert" my a.out binary

When trying to run an a.out binary (doom :) on a filesystem with 4K
blocks, the kernel says:
N_TXTOFF < BLOCK_SIZE. Please convert binary.
and returns ENOEXEC.  Can somebody tell me how to convert the binary, as
it says to do?
Currently I've worked around by moving my (few but important) a.out
binaries to a 1K block loop-mounted filesystem, but IWBN to avoid this.
