I'm now pretty sure that it is a hardware failure of some type.  Windows was 
stable last night for about four hours of compiling, graphics manipulations, 
etc.  But, when I got home after being gone for several hours, Windows 
started exhibiting the same behavior.  I presume it is Linux sensitivity to 
hardware that made it show up 5 days sooner.  I'm presume, at this point, 
that it is either the motherboard or one of the processors.
Thank you everyone for your suggestions.  Of the many messages I received, the 
following were good and relevant to my system and I will try them to see if 
it does make a difference.
1) Try disabling apm/acpi in bios (I had done this in the kernel, not in 
bios).
2) Try a uniprocessor kernel or booting with only one processor
3) mount /var synchronous to see if anything shows up in the logs (I had 
checked the logs and nothing was getting written to it.  I had forgotten that 
you could make the whole file system synchronous; I'll try this.)
4) Increase voltage to the processors and see if it helps.
Per some other questions, I'm not using scsi nor do I have an intel 82801DB 
chip onboard.
Thanks again for the help.
