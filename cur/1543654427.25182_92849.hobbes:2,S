For all other NFS clients that I know of, this is perfectly
acceptable. As far as the Linux kernel goes, it is quite OK, but when
you get to userland, glibc-2.2 and above will insist that this is an
illegal value (they like to sign extend 32-bit values). Causes no end
of trouble, since XFS tends to use '0xffffffff' as the EOF cookie.
I have a patch that hacks the values of such cookies so that glibc
will accept them. That hack will never go in to the official kernel,
so it would be nice if ext2/ext3 could avoid the need for it.

That would be fine.
