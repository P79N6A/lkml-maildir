There is really no point to this discussion, as it looks like a big
misunderstanding.  Maybe you object less if you see the design:
Variant 1 (just a single filesystem):
- Introduce a new variant of links, which I call COW.
- COWs can only link to hidden inodes.
- Hidden inodes cannot be accessed directly.
- COWs look like regular files to userspace.
- Read access to COWs goes to the hidden inode.
- Write access to COWs copies the hidden inode before writing to it.
- Copying file1 to file2 does four things:
  - Create a new hidden inode.
  - Move data from file1 to hidden inode.
  - Turn file1 into COW and link to hidden inode.
  - Create COW for file2 and link to hidden inode.
There are some more special cases, but this is basically it.  So let's
use the stuff a little:
$ cp -cr dir1 dir2
Behaves similar to 'cp -lr', but creates COWs instead of hard links.
Can take a few seconds to create the directories, but not minutes.
$ vi dir2/bunch*of*files
Writing to those files makes a real copy for each.  dir1/* remains
unaffected, no matter how careless you are.  We've made it foolproof,
so the universe has to create greater fools again, right?
$ rm -rf dir2
Scraps one of the copies along with all modifications.  dir1/* remains
unaffected gain.
$ cp -cr /fs1/dir1 /fs2/dir2
Fails, since links between different filesystems don't work.
Variant 2 (across multiple filesystems now):
- COWs contain a filesystem identifier as well.
- Accessing COWs linking to unavaillable filesystems returns -E...
Alternatively:
- Mounting such an fs fails, unless all links work.
Usage is as above.
$ mkfs /dev/fs2
$ mount /dev/fs2 /fs2
$ cp -cr /fs1 /fs2
Creates an identical copy of one filesystem on another one.  fs2 has
to support COWs and fs2 has to be RO or support COWs.  A rw-fs mounted
ro means trouble, as you know.
Maybe I'm just stupid and missed some important detail, but this
design looks like it can solve a bunch of problems.  Do you still
think, it is useless?
