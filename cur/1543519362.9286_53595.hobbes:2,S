Dear Linus,
As an apology for making a bit of "noise" today, here is the bugfix
for the "Memory size detected wrong on Compaq Proliant/1600" bug :)
It was to do with setup_arch() incorrectly initializing max_pfn if there
is a range with zero size.
http://www.ocston.org/~tigran/patches/proliant-2.3.33.patch
Btw, running on a machine with detected 900M (real 64M) had a side effect
of having very large page cache hashtable configured and I liked the
performance thereof - I will tune it up manually for some of my nodes.
Regards,
