Check Rusty's first patch. You basically have to uninstall all the hooks
first, then you have to wait for all running processes to advance enough,
that you can be sure a caller advanced far enough to a synchronization
point within the module (e.g. a try_module_get()). At this point you can
be sure whether you have module users or not.
Note that Rusty's patch doesn't help LSM at all, because he didn't
introduce the separate stop/exit calls.

For the majority of modules unloading can be implemented safely and simple
modules don't have to care about module races, as long as the interfaces
they are using are safe.
