Like I said, I'm no expert...but your comments appear to indicate that

I have to admit that comment surprises me, as I never expected you to

Yes, I read that - and, as it points out, an 8 Meg swapfile created
with the dd command is not a problem, since that's only half the size
of the "block groups" that ext2 uses.
Your claim that I could replace any of my seven 126 Meg swap
partitions with an ext2 partition containing one dirty great swap file
is NOT consistant with that though, or have you overlooked the last
sentence in your quote? It does say "no holes", and that isn't
possible on ext2 for files larger than the block group, AS YOU
ADMITTED ABOVE...

I note that you're using VFAT partitions, not EXT2 ones like you were
referring to in your original post. This is presumably because (unlike
your claims) swap files larger than the block group size don't work on
EXT2 partitions...

On FAT or VFAT, sure - I've never said otherwise. It's your stupid
claim that 126 Meg swapfiles will work happily on EXT2 partitions that
I'm challenging, and so far, you've succeeded in proving me right to
challenge it...

In other words, swap files do indeed have special requirements that
are not applicable to other uses of raw I/O. Thanks for confirming my
claims...
Best wishes from Riley.
