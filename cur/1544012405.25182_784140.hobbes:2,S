Hi, Ingo.
because I also changed the type of valid_signal():
 -static inline int valid_signal(unsigned long sig)
 +static inline int valid_signal(int sig)
I noticed that gcc put this kind of warning into
-Wtraditional-conversion recently, but it is still useful to use
explicit cast, isn't it?
Thanks.
