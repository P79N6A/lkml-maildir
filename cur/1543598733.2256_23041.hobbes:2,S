Hi all,
I get a lot of these messages when the system is busy:
probable hardware bug: clock timer configuration lost - probably a VIA686a.
probable hardware bug: restoring chip configuration.

On: Linux version 2.2.19 (maurice@komodo) (gcc version 2.95.4 20010319
(Debian prerelease)) #3 Wed Aug 22 23:17:20 CEST 2001
Running Debian Potato (stable)
The system is a Intel Pentium 120
The motherboard is a Jetway 542C having the ALI 1542-m1543 aladdin-V chipset
(according to the manual)
This is from /proc/pci:
PCI devices found:
  Bus  0, device   0, function  0:
    Host bridge: Acer Labs Unknown device (rev 4).
      Vendor id=10b9. Device id=1541.
      Slow devsel.  Master Capable.  Latency=32.  
      Non-prefetchable 32 bit memory at 0xd0000000 [0xd0000000].
  Bus  0, device   1, function  0:

  Bus  0, device   7, function  0:
    ISA bridge: Acer Labs M1533 Aladdin IV (rev 195).
      Medium devsel.  Master Capable.  No bursts.

      Non-prefetchable 32 bit memory at 0xd5000000 [0xd5000000].
  Bus  0, device  15, function  0:
    IDE interface: Acer Labs M5229 TXpro (rev 194).
      Medium devsel.  Fast back-to-back capable.  Master Capable. 
Latency=32.  
Min Gnt=2.Max Lat=4.
      I/O at 0x2000 [0x2001].
The system further has 2 ISA etherworks3 network cards and that's about it.
Does anyone know what this means? Can I provide useful information (please
tell me how). The system once crashed under heavy load. Memtest86 sais the
memory is OK, so I'm a bit worried the error has something to do with it.
regards,
	Olivier
