Subject: [PATCH] 2.4.13pre3aa1: expand_fdset() may use invalid pointer
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

In 2.4.13pre3aa1, expand_fdset() in fs/file.c has a couple of
execution paths that call kfree() on a pointer that hasn't yet been
initialized.  A minimal patch is attached.
