Problem: Keyspan USA-49WLC driver broken in 2.6.18,
4.6.19, and  2.6.20 kernels
Description: The Keyspan USB driver module
(CONFIG_USB_SERIAL_KEYSPAN_USA49WLC) that is part of
the 2.4.18,2.4.19, and 2.4.20 kernels does not work on
the Keyspan USA-49WLC (USB->4 serial port device).
Specifically, the driver allows the USA-49WLC to send
serial data, but it is unable to read any serial data
back on the port. I have connected 2 of the ports
together (using a null-modem) and opened 2 minicom
windows (one for each of the ports). Under kernel
2.4.17 (and earlier), I get the expected behavior, and
whatever I type in one window shows up in the other
window. However for the newer kernels, I get nothing.
The green led on the device flashes on the
transmitting port every time I hit a key, however
the receiving one does not flash (like it does when
the device is working properly). When I use an older
kernel (or even windows), both lights flash as would
be expected.
  NOTE:  Actually, the first time a character is sent
to the port, it will blink a single time, but only the
first one, and it will not blink again unless the USB
device is unplugged/replugged. After the replug, it
will once again blink exactly once on the receive
side. 
    The transmitted serial data seems to be OK, since
when I connect the USA-WLC to a standard serial port,
I can see the outgoing data properly. However, the
USA-WLC still cannot receive any data, even when
connected to a standard serial port. 
Keywords: USB to serial, Keyspan USA-49WLC, 2.6.19,
2.6.20, 2.6.18, CONFIG_USB_SERIAL,
CONFIG_USB_SERIAL_KEYSPAN_USA49WLC
Kernel versions: 2.6.18, 2.6.19, 2.6.20
Thanks for any help/advice you can give!
