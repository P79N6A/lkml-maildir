Thinking about it some more, the only way I see to handle all the
problem cases I can think of, is to have two separate resource trees
for each type of resource, one for driver ownership, and one for
hardware routing, rather than one unified tree.  So we'd have two
trees like:
  - driver IO: 0-0xffff
    - keyboard: 0x60-0x6f
    - lp1: 0x378-0x37a
    - hdc: 0x100-0x107
    - hdc: 0x10e-0x10e
    - eth0: 0x2000-0x20ff
    - eth0: 0x2100-0x21ff
  - hardware IO: 0-0xffff
    - ISA dev 00: 0x60-0x6f
    - ISA dev 01: 0x378-0x37b
    - PCMCIA socket 0: 0x100-0x10f
    - Cardbus bridge window 0: 0x2000-0x21ff
      - PCI dev 2.00 base 0: 0x2000-0x20ff
      - PCI dev 2.00 base 1: 0x2100-0x21ff
This avoids the problem of defining a new API for passing resource
information to device drivers: they can just manipulate the driver
resource trees.  The hardware tree will be populated by bus drivers:
the PCI subsystem, PnP, PCMCIA/CardBus, etc.
