  I've also realized this problem when reading quota code. Also we should
be aware of padding of the structure (currently I think there will never
be any padding in the structure but...).
  I like the proposed solution and it would be easy to implement it...
Because I'm currently making some fixes in quota code so I can add this feature
too (It will be really only a few lines of code in the kernel...).
