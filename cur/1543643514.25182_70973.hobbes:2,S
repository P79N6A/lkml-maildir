Jeff and I occasionally kick this around and it always ends with "yeah,
not hard at all, when I have more time on my hands than I know what to
do with maybe I'll do that", or words to that effect.  It's understandable
why Jeff hasn't gotten around to doing it, given the workload he's had
just maintaining UML in both the 2.4 and 2.5 kernel series.  Plus Jeff
does not get paid of any of this.
Now that it's integrated, nice things like that can happen, and maybe
we won't have to impose on Jeff to do 100% of the work on UML in the
future.  (Well, actually I did about 0.00001% of the work on UML, to
wit, a patch to change the bogus virtual contents of ptes to "physical"
addresses, bringing UML in line with the other arches in that regard.
<- part of my new policy of making sure everybody knows about every
little contribution I make.)

It still does.  That's yet another source of irritation.
