Could you please generate a kernel profile?
- Compile with CONFIG_PROFILING
- Start the workload, wait for steady state.
- As root, run:
#!/bin/sh
SM=/boot/System.map
TIMEFILE=/tmp/prof.time
readprofile -r
sleep 10
readprofile -n -v -m $SM | sort -n +2 | tail -40 | tee $TIMEFILE >&2
(make sure that /boot/System.map is from the currently-running kernel)
More in Documentation/basic_profiling.txt
Even better, learn to drive oprofile.  Once it's running properly I usually
use this silly script:
#!/bin/sh
opcontrol --stop
opcontrol --shutdown
rm -rf /var/lib/oprofile
opcontrol --vmlinux=/boot/vmlinux-$(uname -r)
opcontrol --start-daemon
opcontrol --start
sleep 10
opcontrol --stop
opcontrol --shutdown
opreport -l /boot/vmlinux-$(uname -r) | head -50
