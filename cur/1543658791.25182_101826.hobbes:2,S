If the kernel has sched_setaffinity() or some other way of binding a process
to a given CPU (as numbered by the kernel, which may or may not be related
to any physical CPU numbers), then this will do it: execute CPUID on each
CPU and check the initial APIC ID field. If you find one that's non-zero,
then HT is enabled.
My performance monitoring counters driver uses this approach in kernel-space
using smp_call_function(). I don't use the siblings tables because they suck :-)
[I don't think they distinguish between logical CPUs #0 and #1, and they aren't
exported to modules. The CPUID check is simple and portable across kernel versions.]
