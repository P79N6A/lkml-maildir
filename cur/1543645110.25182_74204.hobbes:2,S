Well yes, it's all smoke, mirrors and wishful thinking.  All we can
do is to apply local knowledge of typical behaviour in deciding whether
a page is likely to be usefully reused.

L2 caches are hundreds of K, and a single P4 cacheline is 1/32nd of
a page.  Things are tending in that direction.

I think it was dd-to-six-disks.

Shall try to.

It certainly sounds like it.  Some sort of counter which is accessed
outside locks would be appropriate.  Test that before deciding to
take the lock.
