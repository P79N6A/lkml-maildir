The one time I saw screen corruption with panning was when the console virtual 
rows (p->vrows in fbcon.c) were unconditionally set to var->yres_virtual/
fontheight.  In most cases, this will cause screen corruption (or even a GPU 
crash) when you scroll down to end of virtual memory.  Symptoms are corrupted 
data when you pan to p->vrows, fixed by changing to another console and back 
again.
The correct thing to do is not to scroll to the very end, but scroll only to a 
point where you still have enough fb memory at the end of fbmem to display 1 
screenful of data.  This is done by subtracting several lines to p->vrows as 
illustrated by this code snippet scattered in fbcon.c 
	p->vrows = info->var.yres_virtual / vc->vc_font.height;
	if(info->var.yres > (vc->vc_font.height * (vc->vc_rows + 1))) {
		p->vrows -= (info->var.yres - (vc->vc_font.height * vc->vc_rows)) / 
vc->vc_font.height;
	}
Or this in fbcon_resize()
	p->vrows = var.yres_virtual/fh;
	if (var.yres > (fh * (height + 1)))
		p->vrows -= (var.yres - (fh * height)) / fh;
The above code is scattered because we cannot seem to find a central location 
to strategically place it because of the very confusing console code :-(  
Is it possible that the changes in your development tree might have failed to 
appropriately update p->vrows?
Tony  
P.S.  I believe this corruption was spotted with fix contributed by Thomas 
last year.
