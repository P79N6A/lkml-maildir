Please don't.
POSIX semantics are weak enough not to be interesting. Exactly because a 
number of old hardware platforms simply _cannot_ give you good coherency. 
And a number of old UNIXes couldn't either, for that matter.
What really matters is that mmap() under Linux is 100% coherent, as far as 
the hardware just allows. We haven't taken the easy way out. We shouldn't 
start now.
