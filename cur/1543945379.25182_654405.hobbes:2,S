I'm wondering how the generic, builtin PC-Speaker (config option
"INPUT_PCSPKR") can be used as an input device.
If it can not be used for input, why is it under the input config section:
"Device Drivers"
+ -> "Input Device Support"
     + -> "Miscellaneous devices"
         + -> "PC Speaker Support"
When booting, it is "enumerated" as an input device: (from dmesg)
  input: PC Speaker as /devices/platform/pcspkr/input/input2
Just trying to figure out the rationale behind the choice...
