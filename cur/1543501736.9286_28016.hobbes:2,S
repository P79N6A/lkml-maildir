	Great !:) Now it works. I'm trying to burn a CD in order to see if

your help, you did a great job (a problem fixed in a day !! :)

	Yes, I have also seen a 'Free SRB' but I have noticed it after I
have sent the mail (in which I reported the log... and the Free SRB
message wasn't logged.. I don't know why).
Many thanks for your help
