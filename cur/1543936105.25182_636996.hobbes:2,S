That e820 also has a reserved here at 0x9d000.
 BIOS-e820: 0000000000000000 - 000000000009cc00 (usable)
 BIOS-e820: 000000000009cc00 - 00000000000a0000 (reserved)
 BIOS-e820: 00000000000cc000 - 00000000000d0000 (reserved)
If we keep mapping for such pages, it will be problematic as if a driver
later does a ioremap, then we have to go through split-pages and cpa.
With not mapping any reserved regions at all, we can avoid cpa for all
maps of reserved regions. Reducing the complications at setup will make
code more complicated at ioremap, etc.
Most of the holes/reserved areas will be 2M aligned, other than initial
2M and possible 2M around ACPI region. So, we may end up mapping some of
those pages with small pages. Even though it was not enforced until now,
I feel that is required for correctness.

May be I am missing something. But, I don't think I saw /dev/mem
checking whether some region is reserved and mapping those pages as
uncacheable. As I though, its mostly done as MTRR has such setting. If I
do dd of devmem which ends up reading all reserved regions today, I see
one of my systems dying horribly with NMI dazed and confused and the
other gets SCSI errors etc. I am not sure how can some apps depend on
reading mmio regions through /dev/mem. Any particular app you are
thinking about?

OK. I was thinking that we will have smaller subset of systems to worry
about with x86_64. With above, yes. We need to worry about i386 as well.
Other than the complicated code, do you see any issues of identity
mapping only "usable" and "ACPI" regions as per e820? We can possible
try to simplify the code, if that is the only concern.
