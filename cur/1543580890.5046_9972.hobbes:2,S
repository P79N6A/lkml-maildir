Hi,
I have a server with RAID1 partitions with linux 2.4.1 (stock,
self-compiled) installed.
It was easy to create the RAID partitions but when booting, no
auto-detection is successful.
The kernel says that autodetect is running, then done, but nothing is
auto-detected.
My devices are IDE devices (hda + hdc) and all drivers are bult-ins (no
initrd nor modules).
After the boot, making a raidstart works like a charm...
Any advice?
Help welcomed.
Thanks
