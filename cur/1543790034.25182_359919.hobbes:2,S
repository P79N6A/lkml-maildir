It is important that we don't corrupt .virtual.  But beyond that, why
should they use those fields?  Some were used in the pte_chains days,
and ppc held on to that usage for a while longer (to get from page
table to mm), but that is all gone now.  Unless I've missed something.

Perhaps.  But revisiting this is not something I'm prepared to rush
into overnight - right answers come slower.  I'd rather we start with
what I had, tested on few architectures as it is, and consider how to
robustify it more sedately.
Or, if you prefer, disable the split (raise Kconfig default to "4096"), or
back out the 7/9 for the moment; though I had been hoping for exposure.
