I heard Draft 19 should be out next week, so that should consolidate
the MIPv6 effort even further.

I'm sure we can improve the v6-in-v6 tunnel.  We had some discussion
with USAGI people about doing anything-in-v6 general tunnel, but since
that is somewhat beyond our project scope, v6-in-v6 is all we can
offer at this time.  I don't know about the USAGI folks' status on
this.

Right.  We've had our own IPSec AH support in all the previous
releases, but as everyone probably knows the USAGI guys have
implemented IPv6 IPSec.  This is why we dropped the IPSec stuff in our
code.  There is no point doing the same work again.  If (or when)
USAGI IPSec gets accepted to the kernel, we will be sure to modify our
code to support it.

This is something we're hoping for too.
