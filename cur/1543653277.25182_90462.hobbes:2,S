So the driver is functional. I assume also a cat /dev/urandom > /dev/fb 
works as well.

If the driver has been ported to the new api then yes it works. I did port 
the SGIVW driver some time ago bit didn't have the hardware to test it. 
I will be posting a new fbdev patch today against 2.5.48 today. Giev it a 
try.
