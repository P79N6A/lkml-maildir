I would like to know what others think regarding this area. I think it
would be a good
idea to converge the mmconfig.c implementations for both x86-64 and i386. Is
this not feasable for some reasons I am unaware of?  It should lead to more
code reuse and allow for a more unified stance in how both architectures handle
the PCI memory-mapped config space.
What is everyone's thoughts and ideas on such a suggestion?
I think the resource allocation can be addressed in the future after we have
tackled a unified approach.
