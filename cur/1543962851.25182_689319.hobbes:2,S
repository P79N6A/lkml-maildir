It would be good to have this as asm-generic/posix_types_32.h.
Unfortunately, __kernel_size_t and friends need to match the
compiler and are sometimes defined as 'unsigned int' and
sometimes as 'unsigned long', otherwise we could even use
the same header for 32 and 64 bit.

Some architectures define these as 'unsigned int', which
seems reasonable, though there is no real requirement behind it,
afaict.

I suppose this should become 'typedef long long __kernel_off_t;'
It won't work on pre-C99 compilers, but I don't think we need
to care about those for a new architecture.

this should certainly be unsigned int.

try not defining these at all and see if something breaks.
If it does, that's probably a bug.
