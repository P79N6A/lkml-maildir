This isnt true.

X is actually quite tiny, ~3MB of exe+lib. The data size is due,
vastly, to the X /clients/ using the server (in the above case RH9
GNOME + windowmaker + xchat2 + galeon + few xterms).
Here's Xipaq (tinyX handheld X server):
~ $  cat /proc/`pidof Xipaq`/status | grep ^Vm

VmLck:         0 kB

That's Xipaq, exe is smaller, but libs are bigger, balances out to 
~3MB again. However, the data segment is much smaller, < 2MB compared 
to > 25MB for the desktop case. The handheld runs the GPE 
(

) environment.
So perhaps you could come to the conclusion that 'X' (in the X server
sense) is not bloat, but that the /clients/ on modern desktops are?

You are misinformed. See above.

Why do you think so? For large amounts of data, X clients can use 
shared memory. Further, even if they must transfer data (ie 
pixmaps/pics) across the socket connection, the X server can cache 
it, and the client can use it by reference. (ie a once off cost).
Also, local X clients use unix sockets - blazingly fast.

Have you tried 2.6.0-test6? The interactivity problems were the 
kernel's fault more than that of 'X'.

You wont impress /anyone/ with "just X" (ie just the X server) -
cause all you'll get is a tiled background of tiny X logos and an X
mouse pointer.

"X" isnt the obstacle.
To be able to constructively criticise something you first need to 
/understand/ it. You dont.
Most of you what you complain about, bloat and heavyness, is due to
the desktop environment - not X itself. Try running GPE
(
http://gpe.handhelds.org
) or (easier/actually practical too for a
desktop) Xfce (
http://www.xfce.org
)
Finally, this isnt a kernel problem.
