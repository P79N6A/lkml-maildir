Hello Linuxers,
i known this is a little bit offtopic, but i also known, that some Linux
folks from Brasil are reading the LKML, too.
We are on the way to opening a bureau in Rio de Janeiro, which will have
some PC's and a Linux Firewall with internet connection (to doVPN to
Germany). As the people there have absolutly no PC knowledge, we are looking
for a support partner in Rio. Does anyone have some hints about:
1. A good internet provider in Brasil/Rio? We need a ISDN (or even better
DSL) connection.
2. A firm/person with good Linux knowledge, which can give local support for
this little net?
Any help would be really welcome, so thanks in advance.
Bye
    Frank Heldt
