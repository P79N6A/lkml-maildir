Well, the code that detects collisions and "unsets" a resource is arch
in the first place, and so is pcibios_enable_device().
So I'm going to do a powerpc implementation & test it a bit with what I
have around, and then do an x86 since with my latest (pending for .25)
patches. powerpc PCI code is -very- similar to x86.
Cheers,
Ben.
