Good point; so there's the work of fixing power management with drivers 
known to load and unload correctly (dependent on hardware specs, 
undocumented registers, etcc), or adding refcounting to fix the 
remaining cases of drivers that do not unload safely (solvable in 
kernel). Pick your poison. :)
By the way, what about a reload option that re-inits the module? Is that 
possible/present, or subject to the same difficulties as unloading?

Fair enough. I think we all agree that module unloading is a hard problem.
Thanks,
