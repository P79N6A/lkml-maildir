Hello,
My name is Mariella Di Giacomo and I need to deal with a dual processor
machine (Intel Pentium II) with Linux as O.S. (RED HAT 5.2 and kernel version
is 2.2.9), 1 Giga of RAM and an ULTRA SCSI RAID CONTROLLER that manages
sevel disks for a total capacity of 3 tera-bytes.
This machine is stressed when an indexing process (I don't have
any source code of this program) is run and most of the times the kernel
sends these messages:
kernel: EXT2-fs error (device sd(8,1)): ext2_free_blocks: Freeing blocks
not in datazone
 - block = 3796238336, count = 1
kernel: EXT2-fs error (device sd(8,1)): ext2_free_blocks: Freeing blocks
not in datazone
 - block = 3796304567, count = 1
kernel: EXT2-fs warning (device sd(8,1)): ext2_free_blocks: bit already
cleared for block 65536
kernel: EXT2-fs warning (device sd(8,17)): ext2_free_blocks: bit already 
cleared for y cleared for block 8820961
kernel: EXT2-fs error (device sd(8,17)): ext2_free_blocks: FreXT2-fs warning
(device sd(8,17)): ext2_free_blocks: bit already cleared for block 26981
kernel: EXT2-fs warning (device sd(8,17)): exy cleared for block 8819668
The devices with those major and minor numbers have been cleaned yesterday
evening and I mean an e2fsck has been run and it fixed all the problems
with inodes and blocks.
Because actually I don't have a clue, I started to read the kernel
source code where these messages are printed and I read your email
addresses.
I would appreciate is if you could help me.
I look forward to hearing from you.
Thanks,
                         Mariella
