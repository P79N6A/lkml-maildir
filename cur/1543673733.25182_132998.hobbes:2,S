I was looking over the PIIX3 datasheet and noticed
that the USBSTS_RD bit is only valid when the
device is in the suspended state.
This bit is being acted on regardless of the
suspend state of the controller in the ISR.
Could this be why the driver is detecting
false 'resume' signals and calling wakeup_hc()
when it shouldn't?
Maybe the code should be something like:
if (uhci->is_suspended && (status & USBSTS_RD))
	wakeup_hc(uhci);
in the ISR to qualify acting on that status bit.
Alternatively, USBCMD_EGSM (BIT3) of the USBCMD
register could be tested to qualify action on
the state of USBSTS_RD
I'm going to test this now, but I wanted to
know what you think.
Thanks,
Paul
