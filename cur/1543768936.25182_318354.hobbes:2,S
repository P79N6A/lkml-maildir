From a story I read elsewhere just a few days ago, this problem is 
virtually universal even in the umpty-bucks 15,000 rpm scsi server 
drives.  It appears that this is just another way to crank up the 
numbers and make each drive seem faster than its competition.
My gut feeling is that if this gets enough ink to get under the drive 
makers skins, we will see the issuance of a utility from the makers 
that will re-program the drives therefore enabling the proper 
handling of the FLUSH CACHE command.  This would be an excellent 
chance IMO, to make a bit of noise if the utility comes out, but only 
runs on windows.  In that event, we hold their feet to the fire (the 
prefereable method), or a wrapper is written that allows it to run on 
any os with a bash-like shell manager.
