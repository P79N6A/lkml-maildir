 <<linuxwacom.patch>> 
Attached is a wacom driver patch for kernel 2.6. I have sent my patch to
Vojtech last year. But, he didn't commit it. I bet he's busy. So, hope
someone in this list can help me check the code in.
Please reply to me directly since I am not in linux-kernel mailing list. 
Thanks!

So this is for the 2.6 kernel?
Your patch is line-wrapped, and can't be applied by using 'patch -p1'
from the main kernel directory.
Vojtech would be the one to ACK this patch or not, but you also might
want to CC: the linux-usb-devel mailing list.
thanks,
