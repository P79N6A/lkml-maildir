The patches I've seen require setting the CRAMFS_LINEAR option, to turn on
linear addressing for cramfs, and CRAMFS_LINEAR_XIP.  The result of these
is to dispense with compression.

Really?  I thought that when you XIPed from flash, the page was mapped
directly back to the flash memory address.  There shouldn't be a RAM
copy of the page at all.

In the CE Linux Forum, we've been investigating Application XIP for
two purposes: reduction in RAM footprint, and faster startup time.
However, those both come at the sacrifice of runtime performance
(as David says below).  Running XIP from a RAM-based filesystem,
as originally proposed, might solve the performance problem,
but it wouldn't improve space utilization, and since you have to
populate the RAM from somewhere on startup anyway, I don't think
it will improve your bootup time.  It _might_ improve per-application
startup time, once the system is running, but I think a regular
RAM disk suffices for that.

FYI - Here are some rough numbers:
Time to run shell script which starts TinyX X server and "xsetroot -solid red",
then shuts down:
First invocation: Non-XIP 3.195 seconds, XIP 2.035 seconds
Second invocation: Non-XIP 1.744 seconds, XIP 1.765 seconds
I think this was on a 133 MHz PPC, but I'm not positive.  In both cases
the filesystem was in flash.  Note that once the application pages are
in RAM in the page cache, the Non-XIP case beats the XIP case (probably
due to the penalty to access flash memory).
So the only performance win is on the first invocation of the application.
I'm just now starting to put together a wiki page of information about
Application XIP, for those interested. (It has nothing now, so don't get
excited.)  But contributions are welcome at:
http://tree.celinuxforum.org/pubwiki/moin.cgi/ApplicationXIP
(Maybe when someone googles this message a year from now, there will be
something interesting there... ;-)
