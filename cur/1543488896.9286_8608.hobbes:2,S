I agree with this analysis.  But, if we compare networking latencies to
disk latencies they look quite similar.  We find it quite usefull to 
implement virtual memory and mmap'd files and leave the details of 
access to the kernel.  Programmers have the option to manage memory
or file access "better" on their own, and sometimes they do, but we 
still find that doing it as a service in the kernel very useful and
productive.
SMB kernel programming and threaded or SMP ready applications will 
improve significantly over the next five years because CPU designers
will implement SMP on a chip...because it simpler and more effective
than pushing the multiscalar/superscalar envelope any more.
