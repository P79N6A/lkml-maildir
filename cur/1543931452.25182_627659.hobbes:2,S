This is the normal Unix model.

This is an SELinux problem. In fact this kind of compartmentalisation is
exactly what SELinux is designed to provide.

If it were just ptrace it would be trivial, but its naiive to think that
is the case. Constraining things while not entirely compartmentalising is
a good thing, and policykit is the right path, but the security
components that are needed seem to already exist in SELinux and little ELF
binary header hacks don't do the job properly.
