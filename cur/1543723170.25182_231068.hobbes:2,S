Run
tcpdump -i any -s 0 -w workingkernel host 198.63.211.232 
and
tcpdump -i any -s 0 -w brokenkernel host 198.63.211.232 
While trying to connect with both a workingkernel and a brokenkernel.
Then attach both these files in a message, either to me or to the list.
This will allow us to see what is going on.
