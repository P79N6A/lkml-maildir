Hi Tom,
I'm glad to see that other people are tackling the tracing task.
I must say that there is a lot here that was already out there in LTTng.
I will be happy to review the code you present. Please see comments
below.

Right.. LTTng does not use text-based tracing at all, nor global
buffers, because of the performance hit. I see that it can be usseful in
some cases, but the fact that we have a post-processing binary-to-text
converter that uses the timestamp to merge the per-cpu buffers makes the
global channel useless.

Controlling by loglevel is an interesting idea. However, we are
currently, with the markers, implementing a per-marker fine-grained
event selection mechanism, which enables or disables the markers at the
caller site to filter events, which seems to be more performant and
finer-grained than the loglevel-based mechanism.

That was implemented in the original LTT, but has never been redone in
LTTng, due to lack of time. I'm glad to see you implemented it.

At some point, I would like discussing with you a push of the lockless
buffer management mechanism I have in LTTng to relay. I use per-cpu
buffers and per-cpu local atomic operations to get the best performances
and still be reentrant from most kernel code paths, including NMI
handlers.

Ouch ? What tells you that you are running in a context where it is safe
to allocate a channel buffer when you hit the first event of that
loglevel ? I see it is done in complete_channel(), which fails silently
if the code is called from an atomic context. tsk tsk.. who would like
to miss important events just because their buffer was not allocated and
they were unable to allocate it.

What tells you that your timestamps will not be jumping randomly ?
Same thing for the if (handle->initbuf test in dti_reserve_early_fn:
it should keep a counter of events missed, not discard them silently.

How can the copy be done without mixing TSCs from early and non-early
events ? Why should it be done at all ?
