It seems like I wasn't clear in my explanation...
In wake_up_process():
+       if (time_after(jiffies, p->defer)) {
+               p->defer = jiffies;
+               p->counter = p->priority;
+       }
If a process _does_ use up it's time slice, defer
will be set so far away that this code will only
be triggered if the task uses less than 33% of the
CPU with a system load of 2...
There might be some brain farts left, but I don't
think I fell for that trap :)
