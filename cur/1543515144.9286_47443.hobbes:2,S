So all of the 'attempt to access beyond end of device' errors reported
over the last 6 months, both RAID and standard kernel are all chalked up
to hardware failure?  I mean, that's what this is.  It just hits the RAID0
request layer BEFORE the standard check that generates the 'attempt...'
error.  I believe there is a bug lurking, because people keep reporting
the 'attempt...' error, and this is that exact problem, it just hits a
different place.  
My $.02 (and very little kernel hacking exp :-( ) make me believe there is
still one bug in the buffer-cache code (generic kernel) that causes this,
but thanks for the feedback.  I'll shut-up now.
David
