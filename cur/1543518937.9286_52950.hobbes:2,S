I know: I listed this as one of the disadvantages.

Yeah, the standard syscall interface, as I mentioned. This isn't so
bad, as we need to support the standard interface for a long time
anyway. Otherwise we break binary compatibility for *everything*.

I wouldn't go quite that far.

Yeah, I agree it's not as clean as the kernel doing it. I don't really
