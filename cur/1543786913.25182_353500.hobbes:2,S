Yes, that is true but as you say it does work with gcc.

Good question.  "confused"?  (-;

Yes, that is probably better given it is not possible to have them both be 
the same type (by definition).

Yes, I would expect it to fix it.
In fact I just did it and yes, it fixes it, too.  The repository I asked 
you to pull from is now updated with the below patch added which reverts 
the wrong layout.h parts and changes the enum to two defines as per your 
suggestion.

Thanks for the comments.  (-:

NTFS: Re-fix sparse warnings in a more correct way, i.e. don't use an enum with
      different types in it but #define the two constants instead.
