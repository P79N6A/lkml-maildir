Agreed.
What was that subject? "Coding style (a non-issue)"? If it's such a 
non-issue, why were there so many messages dedicated to it?
I am thankful that the two things I've posted to this list were responded 
to in a friendly manner (one about APIC options locking up an Inspiron 
8100, and another asking for an explanation on what 'cache coloring' means).
