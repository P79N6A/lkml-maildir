Assuming that we want to go down that road, I think you can do better with
more evil macro magic, by using something along the lines of
#define KERN_NOTICE "<5>",
#define PRINTK_CONTINUED "",
 #define printk(level, str, ...) \
   do { \
     if (sizeof(level) == 1) /* continued printk */\
	actual_printk(str, __VA_ARGS__); \
     else if ((level[1] - '0') < CONFIG_PRINTK_DOICARE) \
       actual_printk(level str, __VA_ARGS__); \
   } while(0);
Then you don't have to change every single printk in the kernel, but
only those that don't currently come with a log level. More importantly,
you can do the conversion without a flag day, by spreading (an empty)
PRINTK_CONTINUED in places that do need a printk without a log level.
