it still has the rounding artifacts: using timer_list there is no way to 
do a precise long sleep based on many small sleeps.
even if this means more work for you (i'm sorry about that!) i'm quite 
sure we should take Sebastien's hrtimers based implementation of 
futex_wait(), and use the nanosleep method to restart it. There's no 
point in further tweaking the imprecise approach: whenever some timeout 
needs to be restarted, it's a candidate for hrtimers.
until then, glibc already handles timeouts and restarts it manually.
