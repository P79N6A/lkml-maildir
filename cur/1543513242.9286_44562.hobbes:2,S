NU> Systems affected: my motherboard is labeled as a "P6I440FX/Pentium II
NU> Commander III" from QDI. The PCI IDs are in the patch.
NU> Solution: the motherboard is placed in the list of systems that have a
NU> buggy ISA DMA bridge in pci/quirks.c. Works 100%.
NU> Side effects: none known.
The side effect seems to be that _all_ Intel 440FX chipsets are
considered buggy. Maybe that's just the QDI implementation of the
motherboard that is buggy? Anyone other with 440FX other that QDI C3?
If that's only QDI then that's hard to work around correctly :(
