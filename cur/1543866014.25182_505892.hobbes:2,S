I think yuou can certainly enable an "expert mode", which just reads 
"select" as "depends on".
You'll probably have to do *more* changes to the tools than my suggestion 
to just make them let you know why they can't turn something off, though. 
Why? Some things don't even have questions at all right now, and their 
only life is as implied options that are turned on by others.
And yes, some silly people who hate "select" have tried to turn them into
	bool SUBSYSTEM
		default y
		depends on X || Y || Z || XY || XZ || YZ
or similar, which is a hell of a lot less maintainable than just letting 
X, Y, Z etc do 'select SUBSYSTEM'.
But "select SUBSYSTEM" still does exist, notably in places like SND_PCM 
(where it would just be INSANE to list all the different sound drivers 
that want it as a shitload of "depends on") but also for things like 
NET_CLS and CRYPTO etc.
