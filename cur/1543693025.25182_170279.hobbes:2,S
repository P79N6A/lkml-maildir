Andrew and Suparna,
Here is the patch for AIO retry to hold an extra ref count.
The patch is small, but I wanted to make sure it was safe.
I spent time looking over the retry code and this patch looks
ok to me.  It is potentially calling put_ioctx() while holding
ctx->ctx_lock, I do not think that will cause any problems.
This should never be the last reference on the ioctx anyway,
since the loop is checking list_empty(&ctx->run_list).  The
first ref is taken in sys_io_setup() and last removed in
io_destroy(). It also looks like holding ctx->ctx_lock prevents
any races between any retries and an io_destroy() which would
try to cancel all iocbs.
I've tested this on my 2-proc by coping a raw partitions and
copying ext3 files using using AIO and O_DIRECT, O_SYNC, and both.
Thoughts?
Daniel
