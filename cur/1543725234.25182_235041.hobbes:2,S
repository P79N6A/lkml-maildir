I've had similar problems several times when I started with the .bz2 
archives, and often a nukeing and re-unpacking fixed it.  I've not 
had any such problems since I began dl'ing only the .gz files.  
Methinks bzip2 still has the potential to get the hiccups from time 
to time on certain data sequences.
