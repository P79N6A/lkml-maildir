Hi everybody,
	I want to develop a process monitor (like TOP) in a kernel module.
	I think I must get the '/proc' superblock and replace the
inode_operations->mkdir,rmdir,create and open.
	Is this correct?
	Can I get the /proc superbloc with 'struct super_block * get_super(kdev_t
dev' function?
	I am going to develop this module in C.
Thanks in advance.
-Abel.
