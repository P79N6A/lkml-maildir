Well, I imagine if this problem gets released with 2.4.18 there will
probably be someone
that has such a rig already to troubleshoot it :-)
If nobody else runs into it, I will likely hook it up with a serial
console and record the output on a different machine. There were
plenty of SCSI changes in pre7. I backed out the rather harmless
looking change in the aic7xxx driver with no luck so I am guessing it
was something in the generic scsi stuff that broke the ability to find
the disk.
