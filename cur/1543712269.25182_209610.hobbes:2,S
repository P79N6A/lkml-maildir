I noticed in the dmesg you sent me that you're using the ACPI PM time
source. There has just recently been a bug opened for a very similar
issue (see 
http://bugme.osdl.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2375
 ). 
First of all, scratch trying "clock=pit" and test booting w/
"clock=tsc". If that resolves the issue, disable ACPI PM timesource
support (under the ACPI menu) in your kerel and that should fix you for
the short term. 
As for the long term, I'm curious if this is a BIOS/Hardware quirk on
some systems or if there is just something we missed. 
Dominik/Len: Any clue on this?
thanks
