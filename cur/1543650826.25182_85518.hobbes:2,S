Hmm... Never thought about it.  You mean an API like:
	struct futex_set *futex_set_init();
	struct futex_set *futex_set_add(struct futex_set *, struct futex *);
	/* Returns futex obtained. */
	struct futex *futex_set_wait(struct futex_set *);
I think a naive implementation of futex_set_wait would look like:
	set = futex_set
 try:
	for each futex in set {
		if (grab in userspace) {
			close fds;
			return with futex;
		}
		close old fd for futex if any
		call FUTEX_FD to get fd notification of futex;
	}
	select on fds
	set = fds which are ready
	goto try
You could, of course, loop through the fast path once before making any
syscalls.  Another optimization is to have FUTEX_FD reuse an existing fd
rather than requiring the close.
Not sure I get the point about livelock though: deadlock is possible if
apps seek multiple locks at once without care, of course.
Rusty.
