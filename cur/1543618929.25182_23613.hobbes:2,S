Wow!!  How in the hell did the version number 0.17 get on that file! 
There's over 2500+ lines of diff between it and a real 0.17 file.  There's 
over 1600 lines of diff between it and a 0.05 i810 driver file and that's 
the closest one I could find!  (I don't have any of the versions prior to 
0.05 in my immediate possesion, so it might come closer to a 0.04).  Merging 
is pretty much a waste of time.  I think it would be faster to port the 
current driver over.  I don't currently have that much free time though, so 
I'll have to leave this to someone else.  If it doesn't get done pretty soon 
then I might be able to make the time, but no guarantees :-/
