Hi guys,
as requested by mingo I post the switching speed results of 
my new schedule() implementation.
More tests has been done and these are the benchmarks on my 
PII 400MHz ( using the program posted with my first annouce ):
Test time = 60s
N.Threads      2.3.5       MyPatch      Diff
   2          700000       600000       -15 %
  10          280000       365000       +25 %
 450            6100         8900       +45 %
The 450 threads test has given, some times, values of about 10800 
with improvement near to 80 %.
The results of these tests is clear.
When You have 2 threads You have no switching overload on Your system 
and my implementation must pay the cost of the slot insertion.
But with only 10 threads You have a switching speed increased of about 25 % 
that linear grow up to 60-80 %.
Since some guys has asked my the patch because they lose the first post, 
I include it with this mail as long as the test program ( THX to Willy Terreau).
Cheers,
	Davide.

  You can do whatever you want with this program, but I'm not
  responsible for any misuse. Be aware that it can heavily load
  a host. As it is multithreaded, it might take advantages of SMP.
  It basically creates a growing amount of threads and measures
  their cumulative work (i.e. loop iterations/second). The output
  is easily useable by gnuplot.
  To compile, you need libpthread :
     gcc -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer -o threads threads.c -lpthread
  Output on stdout is :
     <nb_threads> <average_work> <zero_work_threads> <std_deviation>
