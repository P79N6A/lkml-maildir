Interesting observation, I didn't make it when I tried the lazy
homenode (quite a while ago). But I was focusing on MPI jobs. So what
if we add a condition to CAN_MIGRATE which disables the cache affinity
before the first load balance?

Hmmm, I wouldn't allow this to any task/child, only to special
ones. Under 2.4 I currently use a sched_balance_fork() function
similar to  sched_balance_exec(). Tasks have a default initial load
balancing policy of being migrated (and selecting the homenode) at
exec(). This can be changed (with prctl) to fork(). The ilb policy is
inheritable. Works fine for OpenMP jobs.
