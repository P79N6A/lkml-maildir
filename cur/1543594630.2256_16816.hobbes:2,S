Hello,
I am setting up my notebook (Sony Vaio Picturebook
C1VE) so that I can watch DVD under Linux, and one
stumbling block is that (this is tested under Windows)
the DVD drive has to be self-powered to get an
acceptable performance - audio/video output is very
slow when the drive is powered through PCMCIA, and
this is under Windows with full acceleration.
I have not managed to get the DVD drive (PCG-51A)
detected by pcmcia-cs, using either the kernel pcmcia
drivers or the standalone drivers. Wondering if I am
missing something here..
Thanks in advance,
Michel
