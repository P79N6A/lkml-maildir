James hi
This patch is now obsolete. After Jeff's patch to convert it to 
hot plug API. Jeffs patch looks very good to me. I will try
to push it through the testers.
I still don't have a card for testing myself. Again anyone
wants to send me a card. Intel people anybody home?
I will add the missing Kconfig hunk to jeff's patch and will
push it after it is tested.
Thanks
Boaz
