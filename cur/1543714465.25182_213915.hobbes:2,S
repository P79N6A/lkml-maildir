$ uname -a
Linux hostname 2.2.20 #2 Wed Mar 20 19:57:28 EST 2002 alpha GNU/Linux
$ cat /proc/self/maps | grep cat
0000000120000000-0000000120006000 r-xp 0000000000000000 08:01 309740     /bin/cat

As you can see, the data-segment is mapped with EXEC bit turned on.
Ditto for the stack segment, which I think is this one:
000000011fffe000-0000000120000000 rwxp 0000000000000000 00:00 0
