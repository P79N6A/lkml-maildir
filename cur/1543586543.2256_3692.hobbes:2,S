Here is the output of lspci -vx -s 0:f.0
00:0f.0 IDE interface: Acer Laboratories Inc. [ALi] M5229 IDE (rev c1)
(prog-if 8a [Master SecP PriP])
	Flags: bus master, medium devsel, latency 32
	I/O ports at b000 [size=16]

I'm not sure what to make of it.  At this time I am unable to
append="pci=biosirq" as I don't use lilo.  Is there a way to put this
arguement directly into the kernel image?
