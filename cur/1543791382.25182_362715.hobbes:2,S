I hope you guys (Ingo and Thomas) are done changing the API to
ktime_to_timespec.  I have over 200 debug statements doing this
conversion. Unfortunately, I didn't make it into a separate macro, so I
had to go by hand converting all of these.  
They are temporary (but still needed) debugging, that I did cut & paste
mostly with, and modified them to what was needed.  But its still to
complex to make a script make the changes.  Well it will be easier to do
it by hand.
Hmm, maybe it is time to make a macro out of this too :-/
