This isn't quite true, at least for the version shipped with Debian.
The non-existant /proc/*/tty link is examined first. This is
because several people have agreed that such a link would be
good, even though it is difficult to implement with the current
code. I think viro, hpa, and tytso have all looked into this.
The ps code also looks at /proc/*/fd/* when possible. This often
gives a real filename. Otherwise, ps has to guess a name based
on the device number and either a hard-coded table or information
from /proc/tty/drivers.
