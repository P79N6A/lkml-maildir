Why? If one device is faster, you'd want to prefer that one for swapping
/and/ tmpfs. If not, I don't see the point. Except for limiting maximal
sizes of tmpfs or swap, but limiting the later doesn't make much sense (why
go OOM even though swap /is/ available?), and the former can be set on mount.

How?

What is your beef then?

That is exactly how tmpfs works, and has worked that way from the
beginning. If it doesn't for you, it is a bug to report.

There are priorities: See swapon(8). It has worked this way from day one
(or for as long as I can remember, in any case). The "who gets to use swap
and who doesn't" you can control partially via pinning processes to RAM or
limiting their memory use.

Done already, as far as it makes sense.

Case closed.

On some level you /have/ to trust the system to do things right. It has
much more detailed information (and better response time) than you could
ever hope to get. Besides, adding even more knobs to fiddle just makes the
system more complex (and thus bloated/slow) and harder to manage, for a
limited gain in niche situations.
