using stock 2.4 kernel and alteon acenic cards with stock firmware we're
seeing 993 MBps userspace->userspace (running netperf UDP_STREAM tests,
which run as userspace client and server) with 88% CPU utilization.
Using a modified version of the firmware that we wrote we're getting
993Mbps with 55% CPU utilization.

i appreciate that.  i'm just trying to figure out why the numbers are so
low compared to the network speed you mentioned.
