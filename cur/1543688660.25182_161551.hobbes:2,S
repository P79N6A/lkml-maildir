Subject: [PATCH] Use after free in drivers/media/video/videodev.c

Hi,
I think that there's a bug in videdev.c. Look at
video_unregister_device:
void video_unregister_device(struct video_device *vfd) {
        [...]
        class_device_unregister(&vfd->class_dev);
        devfs_remove(vfd->devfs_name);
        video_device[vfd->minor]=NULL;
}
The class_device_unregister will  call video_release. This function will
call  a  ->release callback. As  far  as  I  can  see drivers  do  their
own cleanup  outside video_unregister_device so there is no problem.
However,  if  a  driver  switch to  dynamically  allocated  video_device
this  ->release  callback  will   free  the  struct  video_device  (look
at   video_device_release)   and   possibly  its   container. So   after
class_device_unregister vfd may be a pointer to deallocated memory.
I think that class_device_unregister should be moved down:

The trouble with computers is that they do what you tell them,
not what you want.
