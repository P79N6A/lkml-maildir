Don't configure CONFIG_FB_FIRMWARE_EDID, if it doesn't work
on your hardware. 
Just disable "Enable firmware EDID" in 
"Device Drivers"->"Graphics support"->"Support for frame buffer devices"
of your menuconfig dialog. The help mentions, that this will not always work.
That will make your hardware work flawlessly again.
