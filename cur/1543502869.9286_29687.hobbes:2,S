You're right.  Point conceeded, but it then raises another point.  This is
a different, you can argue whether it is useful or not, semantic for
signals, along with a different set of interfaces for manipulating them.
Why?  I can construct the same behavior in LinuxThreads using interfaces
that have been here for 20 years or more.  The only thing that is not
true about that statementis that I have to be deterministic about which
thread gets the signal, and the POSIX standard lets the system pick one
at random.  Personally, I'd prefer to be deterministic.  It makes debugging
a hell of a lot easier.

All of this misses my point completely, or at least it sure sounds like it 
does.
My point is that there should be exactly one kind of process primitive.
I could care less if you call it a thread, a process, a task, or
a foobar.  There shouldn't be two or three or four different ones any
more than there should be two or three or four file system interfaces.
N different instances of the process/thread/whatever class just like
there are N different instances of the file class (i.e., ext2, iso, NFS,
etc), is fine.  My complaint about threads for the last 11 years (ever
since I implemented a user level threads package in 1988) has been that
threads are just a variation on the process theme - there is nothing 
unique about threads as compared to processes.  
Imagine what you, Chris, would say if I came along with a new file system
type and I wanted to create a whole new object class in the system to
support this file system type.  I suppose you might support it if it
had significant value _and_ it was impossible to implement within the
constraints of the current file system class.  But what if you could
implement it within the existing file system class?  But I wanted to do
a new class, for whatever reason.  What would you say?  I kind of think
you'd think that I was crazy or that I didn't understand that file system
class.
I'm not saying you or the POSIX guys are crazy, but I am trying to say that
you can quite happily implement all the semantics you want within the process
class - you don't need a different class.   You may want to add a method or
two to the process class, but in all the cases - like signal handling, for
example - where the two classes are doing basically the same thing, it's
just plain bad design to add a new way to do the same thing.  Reuse the 
old way.  By all means, add what you need in terms of new interfaces, 
but do not reinvent the old ones with new names.

Can't agree.  I really like that I can do a ps axu | grep http and
see
nobody   23937  0.0  3.5  3152  2268  ?  S    08:24   0:00 httpd 
nobody   23939  0.0  3.5  3152  2264  ?  S    08:24   0:00 httpd

That tells me something.  In this case, it sort of suggests that I don't
need more than 6 of 'em, 2 of them aren't getting used very much.  
In general, each time some bright mind comes up with some new idea,
I want that idea to be wedged into some existing interface - be it a
device, a file, a process, a socket, whatever.   The object orientedness
of operating systems has supported this and shown it to be a great model
for 40 years.  In fact, the idea of a device as an object with a fairly
fixed set of interfaces is often held up as one of the great contributions
of operating systems - it certainly is the first example of an "object"
and predates C++ by about 20 years.
If we didn't "get stuck in the past" we would have different entry points
for tapes, keyboards, mice, disks, etc., instead of the good old 
open/close/read/write basics.

Hmm.  So is letting one thread muck about in another thread's address space
a bad idea also?  Clearly not.  So you want to decide for me whether or not
I can view threads individually or not.  With all due respect, no thanks.
If you want to not see 8 http processes, I'll happily write you a version of
ps which finds all of them, adds up their resource usage, and reports them
as one entity.  I can do that and satisfy your needs.  However, you can 
not satisy mine with your model - if I want to see what each thread is doing,
I can't use top/ps/strace/ltrace or any of the other process oriented tools.
ALL of those have to be rewritten.  And without OS support, some of them
can not be rewritten.   Once again showing you that the process model can
emulate the threaded model but not the other way around.

kill(2) is used all the time to modify the internal workings of some
other process.  You have to know that kill -HUP 1 will cause init to
reread it's config file.  That is a useful thing that your statements
sure sound like you want to have go away.
