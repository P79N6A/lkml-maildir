Why? What if I really want to update the firmware is say my CD-RW, and
it doesn't use any of the ATA-spec commands for that? Should it fail?
I think filtering bad requests is OK - validating stuff like
permissions, concurrent access, pointers, whatever, but the kernel
shouldn't have hardcoded tables of commands that are allowed.
The "right solution", if we really need command filtering is an ioctl
and an utility that can fill a 'filter table', which says which commands
are ok for whom and which are not. Like 'INQUIRY can be used by anyone',
'no, I won't send anything related to CPRM to the drive'. Easy to
implement, no huge case statements needed.
