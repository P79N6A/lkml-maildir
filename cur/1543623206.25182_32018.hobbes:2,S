This just means their ID's are missing from some text file. This
should not impede drivers from recognizing them. If you are bothered,
send code :-)

Well I think the giveaway here might be:

Either your IBM's wireless LAN is dead (does it work under
Windows?) or perhaps you forgot to associate
the card:

looks like it - try:
  /sbin/wlanctl-ng wlan0 lnxreq_autojoin ssid='' authtype=opensystem
with the wlan-ng drivers and see if that fixes it.
I haven't got the kernel drivers working yet (laziness) but
I'm sure they will work just fine if wlan-ng works.
