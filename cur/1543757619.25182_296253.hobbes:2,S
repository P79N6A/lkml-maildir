It is intentional, but could be supressed. But I'm wondering if the
accounting change introduced a bug - what hardware are you using cfq on
(ie does it actually do tagged command queueing, is it SCSI?)?
It's a one-time message. CFQ starts out assuming the drive doesn't do
TCQ, if the driver depth goes beyond a defined limit (4), it will assume
that the hardware can do tagged queueing and change its internal
accounting accordingly. The setting stays that way, it's not a
transitional state.
