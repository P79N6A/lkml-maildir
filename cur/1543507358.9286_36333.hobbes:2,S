I think we're talking at cross purposes. By default, patch sets the mtime on
patched files to the current time. There're options -T and -Z which will set
the time on the patched files to the mtime stored in the (context) diff, but
this is generally Wrong. The default behaviour should work just fine -- all
the changed source and header files will appear newer than the object files
that depend on them, so there should be no problem.
