Oops, please note that we now have some reports that this patch breaks
some versions of HAL.  So if you're relying on HAL, you might not want
to use this fix just yet (please evaluate the risks of doing this on
your own.)
Note that HAL usually does not run on servers, so this should be safe
there.  We'll try to provide a better fix soon...
Sorry about this.
