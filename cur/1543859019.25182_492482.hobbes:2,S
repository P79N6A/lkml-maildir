no, we just went through that and russell king is correct -- see the
brief series of posts from earlier this morning during which i made a
fool of myself.  :-P
although, it *is* curious that there appear to be only four places in
the entire source tree that incorporate that type of logical check.
i'm still trying to wrap my head around the rationale for that
particular combination, since it does seem to be rather infrequent and
(at least for me) a little non-intuitive.
