Subject: why is sk->skb->sk_socket->file  NULL on incoming packets?

hi, simple question - if a userspace ip_queue program (fireflier)
can determine the pid of an incoming packet, why can't ipt_owner.c
do the same?
how do i force, even by using a userspace thing which asks the
packet to be "re-examined", the skb->sk->sk_socket->file to be
set?
i _need_ this to work!
_yes_ i have a modified version of ipt_owner.c which can track down
the full path name of the program.
_yes_ i'm happy with creating more than one per-executable-program-name
rule for instances where sockets are shared between executables
(e.g. they're passed over unix-domain-sockets).
help, help!
l.
