Are you attempting file access in the kernel from a kernel-thread,
or have you just decided to perform file access from some random
kernel code?
File I/O requires a process context. Your file descriptor means
nothing unless associated with the process that opened the file.
The kernel, itself, is not a process. It functions in the process
context of the caller. Also file I/O sleeps and pages. You need to
understand this before you attempt to access files from within the
kernel.
Normally, you don't access files from within the kernel. If you
need file data for a driver for instance, you write an appropriate
ioctl() function in your driver so a user-mode task can send the
data to the driver. Your startup script inserts the module, then
executes a program which initializes the module with the appropriate
file data and initialization commands, all sent from user mode.
Once the driver is initialized, the user-mode "starter" exits,
freeing resources which would otherwise be trapped forever in your
driver.

    was handled in the BIOS, I found that there aren't any.
