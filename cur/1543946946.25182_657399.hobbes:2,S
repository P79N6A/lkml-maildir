I miss CC's. so I resend.
First of all, I tried test it in embedded board.

===============================
It was a very interesting result.
In embedded system, your patch improve performance a little in case
without noswap(normal case in embedded system).
But, more important thing is OOM occured when I made 240 process
without swap device and vanilla kernel.
Then, I applied your patch, it worked very well without OOM.
I think that's why zone's page_scanned was six times greater than
number of lru pages.
At result, OOM happened.
So, I think your patch also improves performance in embedded system.
In case OOM didn't occur, reclaiming performance without swap device
was better than one with swap device.
Now, I think we need to improve reclaiming procedure in embedded
system(UP and NO swap).
