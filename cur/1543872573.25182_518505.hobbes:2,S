Yep.

Uuurg. That's ugly. clockevents expect a per CPU timer especially for
dynamic ticks. If you cannot provide a per cpu timer, then you probably
need to use the broadcast trick.
Register a primary clocksource (as PIT/HPET) and register per CPU dummy
clocksources with CLOCK_EVT_FEAT_DUMMY set - we use the same trick, when
the lapic timer is broken. The clockevents code then uses PIT/HPET as
the primary tick source and broadcasts the periodic tick to the other
CPUs. In that case the dyntick / highres features are disabled.
We did some experiments to support multiple CPUs with one timer for
hres/dyntick but it does not scale and it is so ugly that it is not
worth the trouble. It works for the lapic stops in C3 case, as we have a
well defined point (right before going into the deep power state) where
we can rearm the global clock event device. As we are idle at that point
anyway there is not much penalty, but I really dont want to do that in
an active system.

I wanted to do that in the first place, but never bothered. In an UP
environment it does not matter. On a sane SMP box (where we do not have
the local APIC stops in C3 problem) the HPET (analogous PIT) is switched
off for ever. In the case of LAPIC stops in C3 the HPET(PIT) is used as
a broadcast fallback. That means before we go into C3 we arm the
HPET/PIT for the earliest to expire lapic event of all CPUs. In that
case it does not matter, whether HPET/PIT is pinned to CPU#0 or anything
else.
