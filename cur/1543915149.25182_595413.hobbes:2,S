Rob, another thing i just noticed in your .configs: you have 
CONFIG_PREEMPT=y enabled. Would it be possible to get a testrun with 
that disabled? That gives the best throughput and context-switch latency 
numbers. (CONFIG_PREEMPT might also have preemption artifacts - there's 
one report of it having _worse_ desktop latencies on certain hardware 
than !CONFIG_PREEMPT.)
