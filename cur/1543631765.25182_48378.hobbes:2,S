Nobody has ever disputed that they have the same origin. And some of the
very obvious things are even so old that they have been there long before
RTL and RTAI came into existence, and some are like my "for" loop example.

Here are the license headers of the schedulers:

Where is your problem? I don't see anything else than pure GPL. 
It's the same with the patches, which don't have a license file, but as
patches for an original GPLed kernel they are surely GPL as well.

Wrong. Some files in the distribution are derived from GPLed work, and they
are GPLed. Others are not, and they are LGPLed.
