I believe that kernel programmers are horrible psychologists.
Doing a quick search yields:
find .  -name "*.c" ! -type d  | xargs grep  "panic(" |wc -l
1143
So we have 1143 uses of panic. I'll grant you that the most common
occurrence is the unable to mount root. But I don't think users are less
likely to blame the kernel when they see a dump or just see a panic. A
panic usually implies (to me anyway) something went wrong and the kernel
can't cope.
But by not having a dump, we lose out on real bugs that are stopped by the
panics. The most common one that I come across is a fault in the interrupt
handler of some device. This produces a panic screaming killing an
interrupt. But without a trace, we have no idea where that bug occurred.
So do we really want to play shrink and say it's better to leave out the
back trace because we might scare users, or should we keep it for the few
times it really does help?
IMHO I believe we should do the dump_stack now, and come up with another
solution to the mount root panic.
