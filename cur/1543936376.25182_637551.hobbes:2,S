I applied this patch to 2.6.24-rc7. Now at boot time my DVD-RW is
normaly detected as:
sr0: scsi3-mmc drive: 48x/48x writer dvd-ram cd/rw xa/form2 cdda tray
But I cannot mount it. All my attempts failed with
ISOFS: Unable to identify CD-ROM format.
With mem<=4098M or sata_nv.adma=0 it still mounts and works ok.
