Looking at my tree (which is from linux-mips.org), it appears
arm, sparc, sparc64, and sh have tlb_start_vma() defined to call
cache flushing.
What exactly does tlb_start_vma()/tlb_end_vma() mean?  There is
only one invocation instance, which is significant enough to infer
the meaning.  :)
BTW, either my original hack or putting a cache flush in tlb_start_vma()
solves my problem.  They are really doing the same thing, just at
different places.
