Hmm, I should have looked "in" this patch before:
+Use multi-mode by default
+CONFIG_IDEDISK_MULTI_MODE
+  If you get this error, try to enable this option.
+
+  hda: set_multmode: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
+  hda: set_multmode: error=0x04 { DriveStatusError }
+
+  If in doubt, say N.
+
Not sure if that will help though as the error messages I;'ve been
seeing are different:
Aug 28 08:55:00 hoppa kernel: hda: dma_intr: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
Aug 28 08:55:00 hoppa kernel: hda: dma_intr: error=0x84 { DriveStatusError BadCRC }
No mention of set_multmode.  Looks more like a DMA interrupt (dma_intr) error.

It has an ATA100 cable on the HDD in question, of course that is a cable
that came with the motherboard.

Yep they are all set.

I'll look at getting some new cables I guess.  I hate these sorts of
bugs, as the only way to test fixes is to risk further corruption.

I doubt heat would be the problem as the system is in a new case (6
months) with an extra case fan and a 300W PSU.  Last time I looked in
the bios it said the Duron 700 was running at 30C, I'm not sure I
believe that though.   Its certainly not like some of the old P5
troopers I've seen around.  One friend had the PSU and CPU fan fail on
him, almost burnt the house down before he found out,  the system keep
happly going almost to the end. 8)
Do you think that putting something like a 3wave IDE controller in the
machine will fix this?  ie. Ignoring a possible cable fault is VIA 686
southbridge really that crap.
Thanks for the help.
