Hi all,
This is kind of late, but I can tell you that the delack-timer-5 patch 
mentioned below (which has been included in 2.2.15pre1 and above, I 
believe) has solved my long-standing problem of the crashing webserver 
(both Apache and Mathopd) locking up the whole machine on 2.2.x.
The webserver in question has been up for 7 days non-stop (used to reach 
maximum 2 days), and the only problem I had with a stock 2.2.14 and the 
delack-timer-5 patch was that every now and then a process (not always the 
same) got stuck and became unkillable, causing a load of 1 for each stuck 
process. I rebooted the machine with 2 stuck processes after 7 days, and 
now it has been up for another 5 days, no stuck processes yet.
Hope this helps,
Ward.
