So let him log in as root, do everything as root and be cracked

[snip the patch that makes all user ids equivalent to root, but
doesn't remove networking support]
What for? If they want root - give them root and be done with that.
No need to change the kernel.
You know, if you really do not understand the implications of
running everything with permissions equivalent to root - get
the hell out of any UNIX-related programming until you learn.
If you want CP/M or MacOS - you know where to find them.
