Subject: ARP out the wrong interface
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

this appears to occur with both 2.2.16 and 2.4.1.
server:
eth0 is 192.168.250.11 netmask 255.255.255.0
eth1 is 192.168.251.11 netmask 255.255.255.0
they're both connected to the same switch.
client:
eth0 is 192.168.251.11 netmask 255.255.255.0
connected to the same switch as both of server's eth.
on client i try "ping 192.168.251.11".
responses come back from both eth0 and eth1, listing each of their
respective MAC addresses...  it's essentially a race condition at this
point as to whether i'll get the right MAC address.  ("right" means the
MAC for server:eth1).
client# tcpdump -n arp
Kernel filter, protocol ALL, datagram packet socket
tcpdump: listening on all devices

is this expected?  it seems broken.
