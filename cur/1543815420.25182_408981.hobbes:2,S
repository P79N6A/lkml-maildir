Heh, nice manipulation attempt. Note you are also introduced timing
error of about 114 years total.

Eh, very nice, so I should get radio time source for my notebook?

What about polling RTC from timer interrupt or something like that, so
that you get error in range of 5 msec instead of 500 msec? You can do
the calibration in parallel, then...
