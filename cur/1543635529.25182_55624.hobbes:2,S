First blush is HELL YES!  The issue is accounting.  When you
ask how long a program ran, you are looking at the
accounting that happens on a tick.  This is where one of two
counters gets bumped (one for system, the other for user,
depending on what was interrupted).  This information could,
of course, be gathered every system call/ exit and every
context switch, BUT, there are FAR more system calls and
context switches than 1/HZ ticks.  Thus collecting
accounting info this way adds overhead as the system load
increases, a VERY BAD thing IMHO.
A second point is that tasks only run for a quantum IF they
never block or get preempted.  Most tasks will have some
fraction of a quantum remaining when they are scheduled.
