I submitted the "Auto Localversion" change (and a fix for the fact that
it doesn't auto-disappear on a tagged version like it is supposed to,
submitted 5 minutes ago).
Yes, the goal of this was to avoid overwriting similar, but different
versions, for those of us who are, too lazy to download patches,
but are willing to type "git pull origin && make oldconfig && make" on a
regular basis.
My suggestion would be to classify these wherever they would fall if the
-gXXXXXXXX wasn't present, as they fall into the same category.
They won't get as much testing, but if you see 5 or 10 of these in the
same category and -rc range, that's a good indication that a few people
are testing those kernels.
