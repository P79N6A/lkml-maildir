We don't use deep c states currently; just HLT.
Right now it doesn't make much difference because no multi socket
servers do deep C states and secondary cores can normally not go
deep on their own; but if any of this changes this code would
need to be fixed.
But cpu off line is really a special case -- maybe it is even 
possible to do something better on current hardware.

I don't see any BIOS call in play_dead()
