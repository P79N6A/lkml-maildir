And I think you're completely wrong.
The fact is, they are two completely different and orthogonal things, and
they have _nothing_ in common except for a very weak linkage of actual
"physical device" (which does not always exist).
The set of people that cares about one view is almost 100% different from
the set of people that care about the other view.
