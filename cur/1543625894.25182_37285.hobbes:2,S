Subject: is iproute2-2.4.7-now-ss020116-try safe to use?

We're moving a linux-based project from the 2.2 kernel to 2.4, and one of the
components is based on iproute2 (yes, the source is distributed as required).
Anyways, after trying some recent versions of iproute2, the only one that
compiles cleanly out of the box is iproute2-2.4.7-now-ss020116-try.  The "try"
makes me a bit nervous, so I was wondering if there are any known issues with
this version.
Anyone know?  Alexey?
Chris
