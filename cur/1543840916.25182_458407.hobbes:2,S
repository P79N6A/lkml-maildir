The patch is applied correctly.
This is what I'm having a problem with in your stack trace...
I was unclear in explain that __put_task_struct() should never
appear with free_task() in a stack trace as you can clearly see
from the implementation. All it's suppose to do is wake a thread,
so "how?" you're getting those things simultaneously in the stack
trace is completely baffling to me. Could you double check to see
if it's booting the right kernel ? maybe make sure that's calling
that version of the function with printks or something ?
