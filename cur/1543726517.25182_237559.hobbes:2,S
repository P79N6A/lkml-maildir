I'd disagree: as soon as the IOMMU is reconfigured/reused Network Rx 
could become a problem: it could point to new io areas of the kexec'ed 
kernel.
Btw, what's the preferred approach to clear the pci master bit: 
forcedeth writes to freed buffers after ifdown right now. I'll add a 
reset into the _close function, but disabling the master bit is probably 
better.
