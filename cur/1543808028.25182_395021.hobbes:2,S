My point was to mainly identify the performance culprits and provide
an direct access to those "namespaces" for performance reasons.
So we all agreed on that we need to do that..
Question now (see other's note as well), should we provide
a pointer to each and every namespace in struct task.
Seem rather wasteful to me as certain path/namespaces are not
exercise heavily.
Having one object "struct container" that still embodies all
namespace still seems a reasonable idea.
Otherwise identifying the respective namespace of subsystems will
have to go through container->init->subsys_namespace or similar.
Not necessarily bad either..
