I should have said: If one driver of a multi-function card enables DMA before 
another driver has stabilized its harware, then everything breaks.

But that assumes that a hardware #RST will always be done. The API
was designed to get away from this requirement.

It would be very difficult to add it later. And it would be especially
silly, given that someone would find this discussion in the mailing list 
archives.

The hardware was designed that way because the hardware engineers
thought that this is what the device driver writers would need. 
Thay are there to map to actual recovery steps that actual device
drivers might want to do.

The previous email explained why this would be a bad idea.

Maybe. Depends on what yur BIOS does. On pSeries, I also need to
set up the adress BARs

Hmm. There is a patch to prevent this from happening. I thought
it was applied a long time ago. e1000_update_stats() should include the
lines:
   if (pdev->error_state && pdev->error_state != pci_channel_io_normal)
      return;
which is enough to prevent crazy stats on my machine.
