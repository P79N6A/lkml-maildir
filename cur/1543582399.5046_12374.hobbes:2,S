Just make it plain that patches and contributions to that driver must be
dual licensed. We have several shared drivers with BSD and most people seem
happy that small fixes to a dual or BSD licensed drivers should go back under
the original license. In fact I'd say I'm not the only one who would find it
impolite otherwise.
