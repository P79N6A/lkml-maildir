I have noticed on SLES kernels that when the dirty_*ratios turned down it
still uses alot more memory than it should work writeback buffers, it makes
me think that with the default setting of 40% that it for some reason
may be using all of memory and deadlocking.   It does not seem like an
NFS only issue, as I believe I have duplicated it with a fast lock
setup.
Checking writeback in /proc/meminfo does indicate that alot more memory
is being used for write cache that should be.
