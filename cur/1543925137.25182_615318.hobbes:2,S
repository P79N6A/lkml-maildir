Subject: [PATCH 0/3] virtio PCI driver

This patch series implements a PCI driver for virtio.  This allows virtio
devices (like block and network) to be used in QEMU/KVM.  I'll post a very
early KVM userspace backend in kvm-devel for those that are interested.
This series depends on the two virtio fixes I've posted and Rusty's config_ops
refactoring.  I've tested with these patches on Rusty's experimental virtio
tree.
