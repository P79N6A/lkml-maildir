There's a fourth one (ipipe/x86.c) added by the arch-dependent patch, 
but yes, I agree that this could sound rather overkill to have this 
support in its own dir, especially a top-level one. The files under 
ipipe/ can be built as a loadable module, hence the current layout.
Would you see this belonging to, e.g., the driver tree instead?
