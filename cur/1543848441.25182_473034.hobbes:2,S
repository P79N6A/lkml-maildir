Ick, good catch.
I hate those sysdev devices...
Hm, in sysdev_driver_register() we don't want to return any error there,
as it doesn't make sense to.
Shaohua, sysdev devices should not stop the notificiation if a single
add() function returns an error, right?  All of the individual drivers
want to be notified of the device.
Bleah...did I mention I don't like these things...
thanks,
