Just to remind you of the dozen Direct-Threaded
Forth implementations, anyway. Try gforth f.e.
Question: if you make data/stack segments
unexecutable by default and provide a call
to make it executable again for the few
hundred programs that need it, wouldn't
there be s.o. who could exploit the
availability of such a call?
Question: if you provide a call to make
your segments unreadable, without an
option to turn it back, wouldn't that
make more sense down here? put that in
your crt0...
Question: isn't it really only important
for setuid things? 
After all, you need *both*, and settable
on a file by file basis. If you can't
attach the nonexec-marker to the 
executables on cased basis, just leave
the default.
