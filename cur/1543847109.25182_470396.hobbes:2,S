They are in initcall section order and within those sections they
are in link order.  From include/linux/init.h:
/* initcalls are now grouped by functionality into separate 
 * subsections. Ordering inside the subsections is determined
 * by link order. 
 * For backwards compatibility, initcall() puts the call in 
 * the device init subsection.
 */
#define __define_initcall(level,fn) \
	static initcall_t __initcall_##fn __attribute_used__ \
	__attribute__((__section__(".initcall" level ".init"))) = fn
#define core_initcall(fn)		__define_initcall("1",fn)
#define postcore_initcall(fn)		__define_initcall("2",fn)
#define arch_initcall(fn)		__define_initcall("3",fn)
#define subsys_initcall(fn)		__define_initcall("4",fn)
#define fs_initcall(fn)			__define_initcall("5",fn)
#define device_initcall(fn)		__define_initcall("6",fn)
#define late_initcall(fn)		__define_initcall("7",fn)

You can also add "debug" to the boot options.  That will make the
kernel more verbose, but beware, some distro's init scripts
change the loglevel during bootup, so it may not have effect for
very long.
And if you have a second machine, you can use netconsole or serial
console (depending on hardware) to capture boot messages.
The "earlyprintk" option could help here.  Even without a second
machine, using "earlyprintk=vga" might help.
