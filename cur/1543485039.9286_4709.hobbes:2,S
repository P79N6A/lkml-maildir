I've seen this when I stuff up my kernel / modutils build, when I have UNIX
domain networking compiled as a module. I generally have to do Alt+SysRq+E
to see it though (things just hang on boot up, doing that causes the above
message). I also had MODVERSIONS turned on.
The problems I think I had was that I tried to build the kernel using my
old modutils/modules version of genksyms (from 2.0.x days); genksyms would
fail during make dep, but the make would continue okay. This left 0 length
files in /usr/src/linux/include/linux/modules; even after upgrading genksyms
I had to manually rm * in that directory before things would work..
I had a patch kicking around somewhere to detect if you were trying to build
with an old genksyms, but it seems it didn't make it into the kernel.
