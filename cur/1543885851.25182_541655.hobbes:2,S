That would fix warnings on non-ia64 systems (which is
a step in the right direction).  But on ia64 I have
the
#define is_affinity_mask_valid is_affinity_mask_valid
in play at that point, so I have a real function call
which doesn't have an in-scope declaration, so I get:
kernel/irq/proc.c:49: warning: implicit declaration of function `is_affinity_mask_valid'
