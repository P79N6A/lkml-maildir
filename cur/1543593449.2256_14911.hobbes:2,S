This is completely bogus. I am not saying that I can't afford the swap.
What I am saying is that it is completely broken to require this amount
of swap given the boundaries of efficient use. 
This is only one of several things which make the 2.4 VM suck for large,
small or medium machines at the moment. Until we have a working VM 2.4
can't possibly go into production on my site on these machines.
A working VM would have several differences from what we have in my
opinion, among which are:
        - It wouldn't require 8GB of swap on my large boxes
        - It wouldn't suffer from the "bounce buffer" bug on my
          large boxes
        - It wouldn't cause the disk drive on my laptop to be
          _constantly_ in use even when all I have done is spawned a
          shell session and have no large apps or daemons running.
        - It wouldn't kill things saying it was OOM unless it was OOM.
Furthermore, I am not demanding anything, much less "priority fixing"
for this bug. Its my personal opinion that this is the most critical bug
in the 2.4 series, and if I had the time and skill, this is what I would
be working on. Because I don't have the time and skill, I am perfectly
happy to wait until those that do fix the problem. To say it isn't a
problem because I can buy more disk is nonsense, and its that sort of
thinking that leads to constant need to upgrade hardware in the
proprietary OS world.
