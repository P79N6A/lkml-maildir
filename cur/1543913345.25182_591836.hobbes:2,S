I'll just remove that CLFLUSH statement. It was just supposed
to be an optimization, but is not strictly needed.
The only thing that worries me is that CLFLUSH might be broken
in more ways on those VIA CPUs and we also use it in other places.
Of course it would be possible to remove it from the kernel capabilities
but we can't really stop user space using it.  We don't know how many 
VIA CPU models are affected by this problem. Dave, didn't you have Centaur 
contacts that could be asked? It seems like CLFLUSH causes kernel 
hangs
