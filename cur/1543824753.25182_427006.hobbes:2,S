You don't.  That's the user's task!

Indeed, there isn't.  Think about selfmade installations. Just ask the
user to provide you with the correct path. There may even be several
kernel version's source trees installed, with different configuration.

Distros *will* ship kernel's configuration, but that'll never ever be
installed by default.
If you work on drivers (as it seems), please just clean up the code
and post it to the kernel mailing list (or subsystem specific lists.)
Once it meets the standards, it'll just become a part of the tree,
releasing you from the burden to think about its local installation.
