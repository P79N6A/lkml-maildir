Solaris != linux
The openwall/Solar Designer patch works with bind.
No sense in comparing Solaris with a patch that works in quite a different
way on linux.
Try it out on a non production box and see if you can break it, then start
comparing those results with an unmodified linux kernel.
If you succeed in that, please let us and Solar Designer know, until
then, please keep the fact that it doesn't work on solaris out of it, we
are not interestend in solaris.

So don't tag the "unexecutable stack" option while you compile your kernel
and live happy without it.
Have someone try a lame scriptkiddy attack on you and see your logfiles
unchanged.
It's a choice, not a default.
