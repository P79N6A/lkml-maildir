A zombie is just bad coding style. The parent process has to wait() or
waitpid(). Fix it if you have the source, blame your vendor otherwise.
IPC stuff can be cleaned up. I use the following script to cleanup the
shared memory segments that my multi-agent application creates:
  #! /bin/sh
  Whoami=`whoami`
  ipcId=`ipcs shm | grep $Whoami | awk '{ print "-m " $2 ; }'`
  for i in $ipcIds ; do
    ipcrm shm $i
  done
Actually, it should only look for segments with 0 attachments, but that's
just an extra grep in the ipcId line. Can be put in the crontab.

Linux with Sun style automount maps can be a bit difficult. However, if
you can live with a fifteen minutes delay, you can use the following
auto.master file:
  /net /etc/auto.net
Together with this simple cron command to update the automount tables:
  # Get automount map every 15 minutes
  0,15,30,45 * * * * /usr/bin/ypcat -k auto.net > /etc/auto.net
Works flawless on our Linux boxes.

Okay, here's my extensive uptime story: In my group we had (and still
have) a Linux box used as a public web browsing terminal (and it's also
our loghost) with an uptime of 439 days. We had to switch it off because
we moved to another floor.
