Bless you for putting this into each file - I hate going into a great
forensic flurry trying to work out who broke^Wmaintains a particular piece
of code, particularly as I have to do this at ~5Hz.
That being said, it would be better to use just "Kumar Gala" and to put the
actual email address into the MAINTAINERS file.
For future reference.  I assume you'll still be @crashing.org if you change
employers again anyway.
