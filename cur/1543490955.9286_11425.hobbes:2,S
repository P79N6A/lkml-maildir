	That is correct and smbfs is NOT a part of Samba per se...  That
being said, the smbmount program needed by the smbfs modules since 2.1.70
is build from the Samba package.  Most specifically, the Samba 2.x package
(the smbmount program with the Samba 1.x package had several bugs and
would not compile on glibc systems anyways).
