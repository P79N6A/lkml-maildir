Please don't try to add uncommented code to the kernel.
How does this work?
Why is autofs unsuitable?
Apart from documenting the major functions and data structures, comments
are also needed which describe the interpretation of ->mnt_count.  This:
+		if (atomic_read(&mnt->mnt_count) == 2) {
is otherwise incomprehensible.
Apart from making the code maintainable, tasteful commentary and covering
documentation makes the patch review process much more fruitful.  Please
have a think about that, and resend?
Thanks.
