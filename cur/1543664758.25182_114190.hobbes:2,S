I like this abstraction of dma_addr. As you suggest, it's probably
significant enough to be only considered for 2.7.  I was shooting
for the minimal API change for 2.5/2.6 to make non-coherent 
processors functional.  I seriously don't want to submit a
documentation patch clarifying that this API is only valid for
certain addresses. :)
