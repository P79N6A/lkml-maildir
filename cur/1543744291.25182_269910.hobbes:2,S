Let's slightly modify the parameters...
What if someone would offer you binaries (under the GPL) if you sign a contract
that you will have to pay 100000 EUR (or 100000000 EUR, or ...) if you exercise
your rights under the GPL?
According to your reasoning, this is allowed, since you can still exercise your
rights under the GPL. But in practice this would mean that someone found out
how to take GPL software, and not give back...
