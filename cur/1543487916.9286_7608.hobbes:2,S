1. When an IP packet is received from IP, do we get a chain of data ( as in 
ifnet ) or is it a continuous buffer. 
2. What is the use of the following fields in the sk_buff structure
	1. data_skb pointer.
	2. count.
	3. users.
3. If we have to send a particular IP packet ( which is in sk_buff format )
to two diffrent destinations, do we have to duplicate the sk_buff. 
Doesn't this reduce the performance. 
Is there any other way to handle this case.
