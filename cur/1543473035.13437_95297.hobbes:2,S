The inconsistency problems discussed here apply to the data on the disk.
As long as you don't crash while the disk data is half-written in this odd
order, the buffer cache will give your application a sane view of the
filesystem contents.
What the text is talking about is how an application would recover
half-written datafiles after a crash (and after e2fsck had done its best)
..
But best to just make sure the kernel never crashes and the power never
fils.
