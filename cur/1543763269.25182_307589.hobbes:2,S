If you contact Arcom technical support on either euro-support@arcom.com
or us-support@arcom.com then they will be able to help you with any
problems you are having with the VIPER platform.
The answer to your question is that the ISA I/O address space is mapped
at address 0xf7000000 on the VIPER so the address you need to use with
inb() and outb() is actually 0xf7000300 rather than just 0x300. This is
described in the Quickstart manual that ships with the development kit.
There is also a document describing this (because it is an FAQ) in the
support site 
http://www.arcom.com/support/faq/Embed_Sys.htm#Linux
Cheers,
Ian.
