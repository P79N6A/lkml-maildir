I've submitted patches for exactly some of the issues discussed in this 
email, multiple times.  They've been universally dropped on the floor.  
The last time was around the time of the massive spell-check patch binge.  
I agree that having a documentation maintainer would be a good idea.  Hans 
could volunteer or I could if no one else wants it.  Whoever does it 
though, needs some assurance that patches won't be dropped on the floor.
