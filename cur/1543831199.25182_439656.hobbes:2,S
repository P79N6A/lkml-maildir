Sorry, but the OSS interface is not an issue for the emu10k1 driver. It 
already supports multi-open, because emu10k1/emu10k2 chip supports more 
voices in hardware. Lee was speaking about cheap versions of Sound Blaster 
cards and they are not supported with the OSS emu10k1 linux driver, too.

The questions is which feature is missing from the ALSA emu10k1 driver. 
Personally, I don't know about any, except some extra features like 
rear/center/lfe channel binding, but the old OSS app binaries does not 
know about them, so it's no worth to care.
In my opinion, the OSS emu10k1 driver is ready to be removed unless 
someone notify us about any missing feature.
