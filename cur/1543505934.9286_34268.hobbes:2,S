I had a problem with raidtool 0.90 so had to switched form kernel 2.0.37
to 2.2.12-pre4
As an unexpected result I notice that 'vnc' (the marvelous remote control
program) behaves sadely with 2.2 kernel: the screen refresh often locks
for a few seconds so the overall behaviour is much worse.
The data path is:
 2.2.12-pre4 : the box I sit in front
     |
ethernet 10 Mb (hub)
     |
  2.0.37 SMP
     |
    ISDN (Hisax based cards at both ends)
     |
  2.0.37
     |
ethernet 100 Mb (switch)
     |
2.0.37 or 2.2.12-pre4 : the remote box
