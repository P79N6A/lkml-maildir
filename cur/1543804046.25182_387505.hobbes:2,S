dmesg says a few strange things (this were in 15-mm4 too):
Driver 'w83627hf' needs updating - please use bus_type methods
grant@sempro:~$ dmesg| grep SET
**** SET: Misaligned resource pointer: efe72c22 Type 07 Len 0
**** SET: Misaligned resource pointer: efe72c22 Type 07 Len 0
**** SET: Misaligned resource pointer: efe24582 Type 07 Len 0
plus I had to turn the alsa sound driver off to get the thing to
compile, new for
16-rc1-mm1.
