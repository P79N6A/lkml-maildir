You need to change your /etc/fstab to reflect the new devfs device names,
ex: "/dev/discs/disc0/part1" instead of "/dev/hda1". You can also use devfsd (or some alternative) to make synlinks to the older devices and retain permissions etc... Also, without devfsd you cannot expect module autoloading as modules can't be automatically loaded when theres no device requesting them (in this case the device simply doesn't exist until module is loaded)
