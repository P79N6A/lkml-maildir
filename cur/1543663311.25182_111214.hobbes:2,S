Hello Dave,
it was the same with 2.5.59,2.5.60 (not sure now, I will check that
later) and with 2.5.61 (and yesterdays most current bk snapshot as
well).
Can it be related to DRI ? (that might be my guess). Event though I
can't use DRI on debian unstable because libGL.so mistakenly recognizes
Pentium 4 as 3Dnow! capable and crashes immediately.
For some reasons always, once I log off - system reboots most of the
times when agpgart & agp-intel loaded (if these are not loaded) - DRI
can not be initialized and system is always stable during log off from 
KDE session.
