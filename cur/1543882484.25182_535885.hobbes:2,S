I think I isolated the problem: in ide-cs.c, ide_config() is calling
pcmcia_request_irq(), and this function happens to set irq=35. This irq
was not rejected later in ide_probe.c, hwif_init():
  ide0: Disabled unable to get IRQ 35
I noticed that the old kernel 2.4.26 used irq=40 here. So I tried to
force pcmcia_request_irq() to set irq=40, like follows:
--- linux-2.6.20.7-orig/drivers/pcmcia/pcmcia_resource.c
2007-04-15 21:08:02.000000000 +0200
+++ linux-2.6.20.7/drivers/pcmcia/pcmcia_resource.c	2007-04-27
09:20:41.000000000 +0200
@@ -867,6 +867,7 @@
 		printk(KERN_WARNING "pcmcia: request for exclusive IRQ
could not be fulfilled.\n");
 		printk(KERN_WARNING "pcmcia: the driver needs updating
to supported shared IRQ lines.\n");
 	}
+	irq = 40;
 	c->irq.Attributes = req->Attributes;
 	s->irq.AssignedIRQ = req->AssignedIRQ = irq;
 	s->irq.Config++;
and this happens to work: ide_config() succeeds, and finally I can mount
the CF and use it.
Other values for irq (i tried 39, 41) won't work either.
Which would be the correct way to make pcmcia_request_irq() use the
correct value of 40?
