After the positive feedback I got from my merged patches for 2.4.19 I have
updated them.
-ck5 includes:
Scheduler O(1)
preemptible
low latency
AA's vm changes
with some changes and new diffs 
Major Changes:
Swapoff doesn't pause
SMP now compiles and seems to run ok
I have two other trees as requested
RVR's -rmap vm changes instead of AA
and a pure low latency branch without O(1) 
get them here:

Cheers, and enjoy
