Hi all,
I have recently loaded a Linux on my computer.
My motherboard is an Intel DK440LX (dual cpu), I have two Intel Pentium
II 300Mhz
processors (SL2W8), 256MB RAM, a WD 6.4GB UDMA HD and a WD 13.4GB
UDMA HD (both IDE).  The 6.4GB has my Windows install, and the 13.4GB
has
the partition split between a vfat and the Linux install.  I am using
PS/2 keyboard and
mouse.  I got the new RedHat 5.9 Starbuck installation CD, and have
installed Linux to
dual boot with my previous Windows98 partition.
When I select smp from the LILO boot: prompt, everything appears to work
correctly
up until it gets to the login prompt.  At the prompt whenever I try to
login, it drops
characters (keys I press) randomly.  If anyone has any idea why it is
doing this I would
really appreciate to hear it.  Thanks!
Jack
