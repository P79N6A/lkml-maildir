More or less.  But part of it also is that a lot of the patches I've
written are on top of other patches that people don't want (aka, the
iorl patch).  I've got a mlqueue patch that actually *really* should go
into mainline because it solves a slew of various problems in one go,
but the current version of the patch depends on some semantic changes
made by the iorl patch.  So, sorting things out can sometimes be
difficult.  But, I've been told to go ahead and do what I can as far as
getting the stuff out, so I'm taking some time to try and get a bk tree
out there so people can see what I'm talking about.  Once I've got the
full tree out there, then it might be possible to start picking and
choosing which things to port against mainline so that they don't depend
on patches like the iorl patch.
