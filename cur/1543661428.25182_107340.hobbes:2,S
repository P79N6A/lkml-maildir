I can only agree and I hope more people realize the importance of this.
My main problem with the module fiasco are the complete new user space 
tools. I urge anyone who only cares a little bit about modules to compare 
modules.conf(5) with modprobe.conf(5) and to tell me whether _all_ the
removed options are really unnecessary? What happened to deprecating 
features _first_?
bye, Roman
