"primary ata interface" is a bit tough to define.  Serial ATA will 
become _the_ ATA interface on motherboards of the future.  From a 
software perspective, it really only matters what hardware driver you

I'm putting together a "Serial ATA status report", to be posted to lkml 
and linux-scsi, which should hopefully cover all that.  Your email kicks 
me into action again, for that report, for which I should thank you :)
