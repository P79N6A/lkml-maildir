.7 took a bit longer than expected, due to some security bugs that
needed to be added to the queue, combined with the fact that both Chris
and I were busy with OLS stuff.  Normally we both aren't travelling at
the same time, but right then, we were, so we couldn't respond as
quickly as it seems some people felt we should have.
Sorry about this, we'll try to do better next time.
