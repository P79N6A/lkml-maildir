Most of the time there is no proper way to deal with OOM. Being really out
of memory probably means that you can't format your error message for
example.
Out of memory *really* means out of memory.
Without reverting to things like exceptions, it's very hard to check for OOM
errors every time you invoke malloc or strdup. Writing a wrapper gives you a
nice message and a cleaner bailout, but does not give you an action that is
proper for your problem.
The code bloat involved in checking each and every function call will also
cause lots of OOMs which otherwise would not have happened :-)

Being OOM mostly does mean that something is broken.
