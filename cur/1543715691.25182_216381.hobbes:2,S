I know its easy to say ;-).

Not obviously, and try to use less "!"s.
If you disconnect your /dev/hda, you'll not be able to suspend. Bug?
I'd call it design decision that allows me to keep it reasonably
simply. And I'd say that disconnected nfs is similar issue.
Anyway, feel free to submit a patch, and if it is simple enough, I'll
probably take it.

If you do something stupid, its okay that kernel is not able to
suspend. F3 on /dev/kmem counts as "something stupid". If you find out
something normal user (not root) can do... we are more likely to fix
that.
I'd say that /dev/kmem issue is not worth fixing. NFS issue may be
worth fixing, but I do not use NFS that much. Any other problems?
