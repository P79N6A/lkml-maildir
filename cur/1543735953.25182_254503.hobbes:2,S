Subject: [PATCH] UML - Don't trash return value

I have been fighting a buffering error when sending large amounts of 
data out pty devices from UML.  I have tried a couple of patches that 
did not really fix the problem (and were rightly rejected by the group), 
but have finally found the real bug.
In /arch/um/drivers/line.c there is a function "buffer_data" that is 
responsible for storing data into the lines ring buffer.  The function 
is "supposed" to return the number of characters actually buffered. 
Unfortunately, in the case where the buffer wraps, the "len" variable is 
decremented by "end" before it is used as the return parameter.
