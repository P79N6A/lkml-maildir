 Optimizing for the waiting case doesn't sound like the right
approach, IMO. And all things being equal, doing it outside the kernel
rules.
 Plus it's possible that someone could come up with a case where you
don't want to do it.

 I'd put money on that being drastically reduced if the allocation
didn't happen every call though.

 No, we know that there are conditions where whatever you do to poll()
the latency kills you. And to fix that we need new APIs. Personally
I'd prefer to have poll() be as good a level triggered event mechanism
as it could be and have epoll just as good for edge triggered events
as it could be ... but I'm not the one you need to convince.
