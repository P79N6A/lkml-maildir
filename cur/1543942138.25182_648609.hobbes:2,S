What kind of LISTEN ports? And does it matter if they're DoS'ed?
The only one I can think of right now would be ident and frankly nobody
will really care if that one works or not.
If it's just the management interface etc. (which should really be firewalled) 
then likely not.

My guess would be that it is.
If it's not it would be probably better to look at improving the standard queue 
management again; e.g.readd RED.
