Re: Windows support of checksum offloading (not kidding).
Following from Windows DDK
===============================================
To achieve a significant performance boost, the Microsoft TCP/IP transport
can offload one or more of the following tasks to a NIC that has the
appropriate task-offload capabilities:
  a.. Checksum tasks
  The TCP/IP transport can offload the calculation and/or validation of IP
and/or TCP checksums. The initial release of Windows® 2000 does not support
UDP checksum offloads; however, future service packs and update releases of
Windows 2000 and later versions may support UDP checksum offloads.
===============================================
Win2K SP3 and WinXP both indicate to my driver that TCP and IP checksums are
being offloaded
on packets to be sent provided the driver advertises that the associated HW
is capable of computing
the checksums. I haven't established that the SW transport stack actually
skips computing the checksums.
