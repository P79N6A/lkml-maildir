Jeff,
What are you? Every second post from you is gem. You want to develop
striping and do not know what raid is. Then you want to sue (forgot
who) because he said something (and post Cc: of flames to l-k). Then
you start attacking Alan, Alexander and everyone else. In the next
mail you write that linux will be always inferior to WNT (and attack
RedHat, just btw).
Are you a elisa-like software trying to create biggest flames possible
on l-k? Sentences like this would certainly work:
> This is why Linux will ***ALWAYS*** be inferior to Windows NT/2000.
