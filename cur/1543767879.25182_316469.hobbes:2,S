Subject: [PATCH 1/2] video/tuner: fix tuner->freq updating
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

In VIDIOC_S_FREQUENCY command in tuner-core.c, t->freq is set to a new
value before calling set_freq(). This is not necessary, as set_freq()
sets t->freq itself. Moreover, it causes problems with Philips tuners,
as they need to take into consideration difference between previous and
new frequency.
