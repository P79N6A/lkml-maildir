So why don't we expand #! interpretation to support this right?
How about the "API":
	#!0:/bin/sh -
This opens the script on fd 0. (I'm not sure what a shell will do with
"- /bin/somescript" as the arguments).
That should eliminate the race between starting the shell (setuid) and
it opening the script. 
Besides that sh still needs protection from IFS attacks, are there more
issues?
I agree that blindly adding API features is a bad idea. However here
we have a chance of fixing something right that has been broken for
years.
