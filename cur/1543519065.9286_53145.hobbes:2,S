We are still talking ia32 only, right?  Because the SPARC people would
*really* have fun with this sort of proposal....

Two extra options, the way I see it:
  tristate "  Set up new system call interfaces dynamically" CONFIG_NEW_SYSCALLS
  if [ "$CONFIG_NEW_SYSCALLS" != "n" ]; then
     bool "    Optimize only for lowest-common-denomenator CPU type" CONFIG_NEW_SYSCALLS_LCD
  fi
The second would mean if you compile for 586TSC, the setup code only
knows about a 586TSC-compatible jump table -- nothing newer or older.
Red Hat would ship CONFIG_386 and CONFIG_NEW_SYSCALLS_LCD=n.

I vote for this, but it is monolithic-capable (__init) as well.
