Now I am curious; how are they getting the pc speaker to make any sound 
with the kernel module disabled?
Also there is a very simple solution to your problem.  When a student 
abuses the computer, take a yardstick ( there should be one in any 
classroom ), approach said student from behind, and break said yardstick 
over their ass.  Or you could just ban them from using the computers 
again.
