Ditto on my laptop. I've tracked it down to a change in the file
arch/i386/kernel/bluesmoke.c between pre2 and pre3. My guess is that
- Fix off-by-one error in bluesmoke                     (Dave Jones)
is wrong for some reason. Backing out that change using the appended
patch causes pre3 to boot normally.
Cheers,
