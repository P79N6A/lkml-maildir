Flakey hardware... It is amazing, but I just had an IDE disk fail (continuous
running for the last year and a half - disk, not system) with the same
symptoms. We decided that it was a head crash. Sometimes the disk was
identified, sometimes not. After the initial failure it ran for about 12 hours,
then did it again. Off and on it would work, sometimes recognized, sometimes
unable to read the partition table. I got it working just long enough to copy
most of the current configuration files.
A windows diagnostic disk couldn't even recover the disk via low level
formatting (we didn't expect it to, but wanted to try the software out).
In addition to the errors you show, it is possbile to also get "short read"
errors too.
BTW - the kernel was an old 2.0.33 system that has given very good service...
