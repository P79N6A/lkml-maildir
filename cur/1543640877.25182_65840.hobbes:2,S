I thought his patch concerns only reading audio. 
Anyway, what I forgot to mention that this slowdown doesn't occur if I
plug the writer to a Promise pdc20265 or CMD649, but both of those have
the random buffer underrun problem which I understand you know about.
That's with earlier kernels, up to 2.4.19-ac4, I haven't tried them
with newer ones, but it seems it's only the VIA 686b southbridge that
has this problem. I've tried the writer on an old Pentium system too,
which has an Intel PIIX3 and no problems with that.
