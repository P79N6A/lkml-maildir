I still have to look into Rik's patch, but I just checked that we don't
have a bitflag in the task struct to account if the task is running in a
privilegied level (we only raise the two bits in eflags in sys_iopl).

I agree that we should not send a SIGKILL to iopl() tasks. But we may send
them a recoverable sigbus instead of a SIGKILL, no DoS troubles since a
iopl task is just able to crash the machine without having to allocing
memory :).
