Divergence and damage to a configure help file ?
As someone who professes to be well-versed in social systems and their
associated mechanics, I am sure you understand the notions of social
contracts and the like.  Thus, if we, as the developers who actually
look at the Config.help, drop the changes then that is our problem.  And
if we don't care, then there must be nothing to care about.
If Marcelo and Linus are not begging for Configure.help updates (like I
beg for SCSI layer rewrites) then there is a reason.
