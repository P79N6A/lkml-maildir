Subject: [PATCH] Remove spinlock workaround for pre 2.95 gccs
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Remove the empty initializer workaround that was added for egcs 1.1.
Only 2.95+ is supported now, so all compilers should support empty
structures.
The if just checked for __GNUC__, which means that 2.95 got
the workaround (and the incompatibility) too even though it didn't need it.
Advantage is that gcc 2.95 and 3.x compiled kernels are now binary
compatible. Unfortunately module loading still checks the compiler
version, but I guess that could be taken out now. As far as I know
there should be no compiler related incompatibilities now.
