No. That's how the callback could look alike.

Hmmh. We won't need mtd->pre_write(), because the file system's 
get_xip_page aop will have to ask mtd for the address anyway similar 
to the way ext2_get_xip_page does call bdev_ops->direct_access.
If that call would pass the information whether the future access is 
read-only or read+write, the device driver could do its housekeeping.
I think we should also cover put_page() plus mtd->post_write() inside 
a put_xip_page() address space operation provided by the fs. This way 
calls are balanced, and we have stuff in a single place rather then 
duplicating code. The fs could rely on a generic implementation in 
filemap_xip in case it does'nt need to do its own magic here.

That point was indeed confusing. Let my try again:
The only way, how an initial reference to a page can be retrieved, is 
from the driver by using a bdev_ops->direct_access alike call. The 
driver has to be able to check, if all references have been returned. 
That would be done in three steps:
1. stop handing out new references
2. use the unmap_page_range callback to get references for page table 
entries back
3. check if other (temporary) references are still handed out, wait 
until they get returned.
Using a helper function to look into page->count is a possible 
implementation for #3. And because the page->count cannot get changed 
while noone has a reference, I don't see a race condition in looping 
over all pages and checking page->count. This implementation has an 
advantage, if the device driver wants to make sure that a small page 
range is not accessed.
If the device driver needs to ensure that there are no references to 
any page on the enitre flash media, it might use a global counter to 
count the sum of references and save looping over all pages.
so long,
Carsten
