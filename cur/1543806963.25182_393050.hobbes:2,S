Not coming back the second time usually means it staggers through the first 
dazed and confused, but not badly enough so that you notice. The second 
attempt kills it. In this case, I'd go looking for something that plays up 
after the first resume. You might also try some of the hints on the suspend2 
web site, such as trying from init S with minimal modules loaded. (If that 
works, you know it's something loaded later in the boot process that messes 
things up).

If you can't get it to go, try the suspend2 mailing list. I try to be as 
helpful as I can, and there are tons of users on there with good suggestions 
and experience you can make use of as well.

Yes. You'll have much better success without DRI in the picture.
