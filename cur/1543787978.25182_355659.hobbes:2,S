Ingo,
I'll take this late opportunity to report something that have been 
looking suspicious since 2.6.13-rt13, inclusive, about this symbol of 
tsc_c3_compensate being undefined and causing some noise on all kernel 
builds since then.
To put things in brief, here follows a small exchange that took place on 
the linux-audio-user list, regarding this thingie. Apparently for Mark, 
it was a kernel build showstopper.

I'm spotting a very similar message when building 2.6.13.x-rt14, but as 
a module linkage warning, not a fatal build error.
Maybe that's because I try to configure _everything_ I can as a module, 
not as built-in. As this has been just a warning on the module install 
phase I got along and all seems to boot and run fine -- except for some 
acpi stuff e.g. I've lost thermal zone sensor on my laptop, but that 
didn't look like a big deal.
Yep, that's it... I found the exact messages in my attic, although from 
an erlier build:
WARNING: 
/lib/modules/2.6.13.1-rt13.0mdk/kernel/drivers/char/hangcheck-timer.ko 
needs unknown symbol do_monotonic_clock
WARNING: 
/lib/modules/2.6.13.1-rt13.0mdk/kernel/drivers/acpi/processor.ko needs 
unknown symbol tsc_c3_compensate
How about reporting to Ingo and/or the lkml? As you can see its not an 
AMD64 issue, because I don't have such a beast here.
Bye.
