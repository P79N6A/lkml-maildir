Elaborate, please. What is the parent dentry of file that happens to have
the same name as a directory? What happens upon rename() over (or from)
it? I'm not asking about the implementation - just about the semantics you
want for those objects. What do you want to see if it is NFS-exported?
What do you want to have upon d_path() of such animal?
