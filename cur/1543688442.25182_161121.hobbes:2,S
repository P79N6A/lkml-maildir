Of course it dowesn't.
The probability gets rather smaller as numbers go down, and bigger as
they go up.
With 2^128 bits, the chance of a a collision between 2^64 randomly chosen 
pictures is 50%.
At 2^54 pictures, it's about one in a million, and at 2^34 (enough for
several pictures of everyone alive) one in a billion billion.
At more common numbers of pictures (say 2^14) it becomes vanishingly
unlikely for anyone to have two matching pictures (even with several billion
archives)
