So on the syscall path you're now going to something like (pseudocode):
if (unlikely(current->audit_context)) {audit_syscall_entry()} 
else if (audit_enabled) {audit_alloc(); audit_syscall_entry()}
I agree, if this is what you want to do, then clearing the thread flag would
be a bad idea.  I'd assumed the current behaviour was by design as allocating
contexts at syscall time doesn't seem a great idea but if you need the 
functionality, you need the functionality.
