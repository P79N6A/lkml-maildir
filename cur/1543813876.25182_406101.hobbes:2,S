In one of those analysis (2.6 sandpoint kernel) they didn't disable
CONFIG_KALLSYMS (they disabled it on the tqm860l though), that makes the
kernel way too big and should be disabled by embedded systems, I don't
understand. That one at least should be fixed, 2.4 didn't even feature
kallsyms.
Also, they claim that context switches are "on average 55% slower (range:
10...94%)", which may be very well a ppc-only bug (in x86 at least
system calls got much faster). And syscalls being much slower is why most
of the other microbenchmarks look so bad.
