simple matter to handle but do note that i have to stay on 2.3.5 for my usb
stuff to work, above that (2.3.11 not tested yet), the usb stuff fails.
i have multiple external usb mice and a glidepoint by the keyboard.
from xf86 config,
Section "Pointer"
    Protocol    "ps/2"
    Device      "/dev/psaux"
    Buttons     5
EndSection
Section "Xinput"
    SubSection "Mouse"
        Port "/dev/USB mouse"
        DeviceName "Logitech wheel"
        Protocol    "imps/2"
        Device      "/dev/USB mouse"
        Buttons         5
        ZAxisMapping    5 4
    EndSubSection
    SubSection "Mouse"
        Port "/dev/USB mouse"
        DeviceName "Logitech wheel Core"
        Protocol    "imps/2"
        Device      "/dev/USB mouse"
        Buttons         5
        ZAxisMapping    5 4
        AlwaysCore
    EndSubSection
 EndSection
there you have it, enjoy.
-d
p.s. those two above are distictly different in a subtle way and they're both
necessary.  the second contains "AlwaysCore" which allows it's events to be
mapped to the core pointer which happens to be my glidepoint.
