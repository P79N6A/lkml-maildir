Thyose values dont show any problems. In fact your machine seems to think it
had a ton of free memory to waste and has let it fill up with stuff that has
been accessed - just on the chance that it may be reused.
It hasn't even felt enough memory pressure to start swapping. When you 
say it "becomes slow", what precisely becomes slow ?
Also what disks do you have and how are they set up ?
