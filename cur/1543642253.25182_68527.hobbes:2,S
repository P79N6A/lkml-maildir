There is nothing about nlink == 1 means assume -noleaf, so it should not work
with old way too, right? Have anybody verified? ;)
Actually patch might be easily modified to represent i_nlink == 1 for
large directories, but still maintain correct on-disk nlink count.
(and show maximal possible nlink count for regular files. Hm,
I wonder if tar and stuff would break if met with file that have
67000 hardlinks ;) ).

All of these programs are broken if there is no way to turn this feature off
then. ;)
