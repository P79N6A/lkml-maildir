Is there a sample somewhere?

It's a very simple allocator. I don't whink we have enough SRAM
without it. For now it would work but it's probably too small
for all potential users at a time.
There may be up to 6 Ethernet ports (not sure about hardware
status, not yet supported even by Intel) - 7 queues * 128 entries
each = ~ 3.5 KB. Add 2 long queues (RX) for HSS and something
for TX, and then crypto, and maybe other things.
Current allocator have its potential problems, but they can be
solved internally (fragmentation, be we tend to use only
128-entry queues (RX and TX-ready Ethernet pool) and short,
16-entry ones (TX) - easy to deal with).
