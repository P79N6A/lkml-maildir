This didn't used to be a bug, but it is now (all these changes and 
merges have let some thigns slip in I'm afraid, and I'm not just 
referring to the work in the last few days, I'm also referring to 
changes that were lost in the time of the S/PDIF and PM merges).
Anyway, in i810_write, the lines that read:
if (cnt > (dmabuf->dmasize - dmabuf->count))
	cnt = dmabuf->dmasize - dmabuf->count;
should read:
if (cnt > (dmabuf->dmasize - swptr))
	cnt = dmabuf->dmasize - swptr;

Can you add a debug check to update_lvi()?  Something like:
#ifdef DEBUG_MMAP
         if (dmabuf->count > dmabuf->fragsize && inb(port+OFF_CIV) == x)
                 printk(KERN_DEBUG,"i810_audio: update_lvi - CIV == LVI\n");
#endif
and see if that triggers with the original mmap code?
