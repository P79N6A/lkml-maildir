I haven't look closely at the block tagging, but for the FCP protocol,
there are no tags, just the type of queueing to use (task attributes)
- like ordered, head of queue, untagged, and some others. The tagging
is normally done on the adapter itself (FCP2 protocol AFAIK). Does this
mean block level queued tagging can't help FCP?
Maybe the same for iSCSI, other protocols, and pseudo adapters -
usb, ide, and raid adapters.
