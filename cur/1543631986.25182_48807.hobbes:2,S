Since portability to other compilers is really not an option with linux,
it's a lot more important that the kernel code use a _consistent_
convention than it use a `standard' one.
So before recommending that people use a different syntax than the one
historically used, are you going to run over the whole kernel and
replace all the existing uses of `field:' with `.field = ' (and brave
the flamewar that it would probably require)?
