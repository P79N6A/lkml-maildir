Subject: [PATCH -mm 0/2] Hibernation: Arbitrary boot kernel support on x86_64

Hi,
The following two patches make it possible to restore the memory state from a
hibernation image with the help of a kernel different from the image one.
The first patch adds the generic, platform independent code needed for that.
The second patch implements the idea on x86_64.
Greetings,
Rafael
