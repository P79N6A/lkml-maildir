BK revision numbers aren't stable, so "1.1757" doesn't say much.
Instead, quote keys, either :KEY: or :MD5KEY:, like so:
% bk prs -hnd:KEY: -r1.1657 ChangeSet
akpm@osdl.org[torvalds]|ChangeSet|20040323152307|55600
% bk prs -hnd:MD5KEY: -r1.1657 ChangeSet
4060565bRhJji9RfHpiUg8dYxnHR1A
Those identifiers are eternal and unchanging, and can be used almost
anywhere a revision number can be used.  (Note that I used a different
rev, as I don't have 1.1757 in my tree at the moment.)

bk clone has a -r option, but it just does an undo internally.  You
should definitely have a local mirror of the kernel source and make
temporary clones to work in, then the only things that you're wasting
are compute cycles and disk IO (rather than network bandwidth).
% (cd mirror/linux-2.5; bk pull)
% bk clone -ql -r4060565bRhJji9RfHpiUg8dYxnHR1A mirror/linux-2.5 tmptree
This works better if you have enough RAM to cache the entire BK tree
comfortably (at least 768MB, preferably a gig).
