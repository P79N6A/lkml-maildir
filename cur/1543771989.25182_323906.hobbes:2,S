This patch is incorrect, it adds PCI ID of SiS IDE controller (this ID 
is common for almost all SiS IDE controllers and is already present in 
sis5513_pci_tbl[]) to the table of SiS Host PCI IDs.  As a result driver 
will try to use ATA_133 on all _unknown_ IDE controllers.  You need
to add PCI ID of the Host chipset (lspci should reveal it) instead.
Thanks,
