Ok, this has fixed it. At least the other way round: compiling in the
basic usb stuff and psmouse did the trick in -mm6, too.

Attached is:
	- config-2.6.7-mm6
		the config file for both runs
The following oops files were created with FULL mm6:
	- dmesg.mm6.oops
		the dmesg output together with the oops
	- ksymoops.mm6.txt
		the output of ksymoops on the above file
There is another Oops with bk-usb and usb-locking-fix reverted:
	- ksymoops.mm6.2nd.txt

I leave this out for now as it works when compiling in input,usb,psmouse
etc.
Best wishes
