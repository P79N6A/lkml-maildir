Subject: [2.6.22 PATCH 25/26] dm raid1: switch rh_in_sync to blocking in do_reads
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/5/8/411

From: Jonathan Brassow <jbrassow@redhat.com>
The call to rh_in_sync() in do_reads() should be allowed to block.  It
is in the mirror worker thread which already permits blocking
operations.  This will be needed to support clustered mirroring which
will perform network operations.
