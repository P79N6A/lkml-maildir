I think you're wrong here.  It's a little hard to say because the 
terminology is confusing and not yet standardized.
For the sake of argument, let's call the stages of STD and STR by these 
names (also noted are the current PSMG values):
	Suspend to disk:
	"prepare to create snapshot" (= FREEZE)
	"continue after snapshot" (= RESUME)
	Resume from disk:
	"prepare to restore snapshot" (= PRETHAW)
	"continue after restore" (= RESUME)
	Suspend to RAM:
	"suspend" (= SUSPEND)
	"resume" (= RESUME)
The real reason for adding PRETHAW was that drivers couldn't distinguish
between "continue after restore" and "resume", other than by examining the
device's state -- since the PM core doesn't pass any information to the
resume() method.
I suppose we could have modified the "prepare to create snapshot" code 
instead, but doing so would mean that "continue after snapshot" and 
"continue after restore" would always do the same thing, which is not 
necessarily a good idea.
Anyway, based on this analysis it seems reasonable to have Six (6) method 
pointers.  Suggested names (in the same order as above):
	pre_snaphot()
	post_snapshot()
	pre_restore()
	post_restore()
	suspend()
	resume()
People apparently assume that pre_snapshot() and pre_restore() would 
always do the same thing and hence be redundant.  I'm not so sure; time 
will tell.  Doing it this way certainly is more clear.
Then there's the question of having early_ and late_ versions of some of 
these things (i.e., one called with interrupts enabled, the other with 
interrupts disabled).  I don't know to what extent that would be 
necessary; perhaps the each method call should occur in two phases with 
the interrupt-enable status changed in between.  Then the interrupt-enable 
setting could be passed as an argument.
