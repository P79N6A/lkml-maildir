Fair enough, although to be fair the savings are still there even with
-Os enabled.  With CONFIG_CC_OPTIMIZE_FOR_SIZE=y:
   text	   data	    bss	    dec	    hex	filename
 682564	 197172	 116384	 996120	  f3318	vmlinux-before
 681824	 197244	 116384	 995452	  f307c	vmlinux-after
And with a realistic config rather than allnoconfig, you could easily
save as much as 3 or even 4 KB of text!
BTW, allnoconfig has CONFIG_NET=n, so we have to find someone else to
blame here.

No pun intended I'm sure...
Anyway, it would be great to find ways to make big improvements.  But
I think the most realistic way to shrink the kernel is the same way it
grows in the first place -- one small piece at a time.
