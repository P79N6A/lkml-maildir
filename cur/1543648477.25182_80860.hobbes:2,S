Some of the functions in the trace was scsi stuff.
I have a tekram scsi controller, driven by
"SYM53C8XX Version 2 SCSI support"
The crash happens immediately after initializing
the controller and discovering the two
disks.  This is where autodetection
of RAID usually happens.
So it seems to me that it is either some
scsi problem, or a RAID problem.
The problem affects both 2.5.43 and 2.5.43-mm2.
