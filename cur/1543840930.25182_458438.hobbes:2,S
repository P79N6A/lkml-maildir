After discussing this with John and Jesse we found that we want to do an update 
for all our drivers and fix the issue. I will send a patch later out that 
removes the LICENSE file and changes the header of the involved files. I will 
most likely have to do this for e100 and ixgb as well, so it will come a bit 
later than right away.
Thanks Pavel.
Cheers,
Auke
