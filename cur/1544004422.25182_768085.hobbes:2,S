Note: all parsers except for the ar7part return kmalloced memory.
The ar7part parser returns a pointer of static array.  While currently
there is no in-kernel user of this parser, there should not be cause
regression.
Anyway, I suppose ar7part parser also should return kmalloced memory,
as like as all other parsers.
