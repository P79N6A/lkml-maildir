Note that despite the name, cpusets handles both CPU and
Memory affinity.
Which is probably why Hubertus is calling them cpumem sets.
And, indeed, why I have called them cpumemsets on alternate
years myself.
However the rest of your points, except where clearly specific
to the scheduler, apply equally well, so this point is not
critical at this point in the discussion.
