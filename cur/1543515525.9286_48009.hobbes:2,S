If you mean nesting to the same spin lock, as I recall that isn't allowed on
Solaris. I can double check that, it has been a couple of months since I
last looked at it.
I think the Solaris DDI/DKI manuals are online.
If you mean two separate locks, A & B, where sometimes you have to get both:
When the spin lock is created, you have to say what the highest interrupt
level it will ever be accessed from is.
