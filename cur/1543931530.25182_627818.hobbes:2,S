So, I have to rewrite ub to split the paths after all, right?
Let's do this then: I'll wait until your patch gets to Linus and
then update it with the split. The reason is, I need the whole
enchilada applied and I don't want to bother tracking iterations
and all the little segments (of which you already have 30).
Until then, ub will have a race by using your original small patch.
Best wishes,
