I guess it was Rusty.  The idea message is a funny way of telling you
that you are sending incomplete ip headers.  Something that is not
likely to occur unless you are trying to send corrupt packets via raw ip
sockets...

There are people who do actually have fun developing linux code.  And
Rusty has a peculiar sense of humor... for further reference see the
comments like 'furniture shopping' throughout the netfilter/iptables
source code.  I sometimes wish I had the same humor like he has.
Yes, I know.  Stuff like this is not exactly useful in error messages.
I'd say it's one of the few remainders of the 2.3.x early development
time.  Like the "Rusty's brain broke" messages that have recently been
removed/replaced.
btw: *nix has a long history of funny error messages, like 'printer on
fire' or others.

It is even in 2.4.x, where it could have been fixed throughout the last
couple of years.  Nobody else has yet complained.
