Haven't heard anything from Dell support, so I'm
following up here with some more info.
After thinking it was a problem that stemmed from
a BIOS upgrade, I downgraded to the version I had before.
Surprisingly this didn't work and suddenly I remembered
that I had also done a firmware upgrade. :)
This is probably not that easy to downgrade.

Why does it report itself as ide2: ? Wouldn't ide1 be more
logical since this is a laptop with just a HD and a CDROM?
