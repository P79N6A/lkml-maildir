sorry for the delay on this, it ended up in a mail folder that i don't
check very often.
jackd wakes clients by writing a single byte to a FIFO. the first
client is sleeping on the other side of the FIFO. when that client is
done, it writes a single byte to another FIFO. either another client
is sleeping on the other side of that FIFO, or if there are no other
clients, jackd is waiting for the client there.
the "chain" of wakeup FIFOs is rearranged every time the graph
execution order is modified (e.g. by new connections being established
between clients that requires a different execution order).
the chain is executed every time jackd is woken by its "backend"
client, typically the ALSA client that waits on the fd's corresponding
to an audio interface to be readable and/or writable. in other words,
every interrupt from the audio interface.
we know that writes to FIFOs are not really RT-safe, but they are the
closest thing linux has at this time. i have outlined an idea to ingo
that florian and i cooked up one evening on IRC that would provide
true RT-safe IPC mechanisms, but as i recall, he didn't seem to think
that much of it :)
