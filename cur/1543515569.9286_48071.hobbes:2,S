A few comments:
- the glibc patch mentioned is certainly not the one which would be
  included.  It would a create a libc which only works on new kernels.
- different fields in the stat structures should be used.  Leave the ones
  following the time fields available for nanosecond resolution time stamps.
  This is why these unused fields are there in the first place.
