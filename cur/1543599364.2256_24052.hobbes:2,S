No, it seems stuck at a non-zero value.

The non-zero value is probably because I was using another device.

Yes, I have a SanDisk ImageMage (SDDR-12) that sorta-works with the
usb-storage driver.
The device times out though after transferring a few files.  I don't
know if the problem is with the usb-storage driver, usb-uhci, or the
device itself.  But this problem has existed for a long time, and OHCI
users don't report this problem.  (using usb-storage with this device
and my little program to transfer files to it:
http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/mj-tools/
)  I haven't been able to
track this bug down yet...
The behaviour of the usb-storage stuff is unchanged from 2.4.7, but the
visor definitely did work with 2.4.7, where it doesn't now.
