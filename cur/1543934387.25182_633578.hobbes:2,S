Bugreport regarding forcedeth driver.
When returning from suspend-to-RAM the MAC-address byteorder is 
reversed. After another suspend-resume cycle the MAC-address is again 
correct. This brings a great deal of pain since the NIC is assigned a 
random MAC-address when it is detected as invalid.
I cannot say if this issue appeared recently or if it's been in the 
kernel for a while, as I've been using wireless until recently.
I read somewhere on lkml that the mac is read from the device, then 
reversed and finally written back to the device. Can it be that it is 
read again on resume and reversed, and then again written to the device? 
This would explain why it's ok every other resume cycle.
MAC is always correct when cold booting.
