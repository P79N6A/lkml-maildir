No operations can be done once it's closed, only while it's opened.
At fault time we need to be able to fault pages that belong to another
thread group. To call get_user_pages() we need to have the task_struct
and the mm_struct for the other thread group.
At one time we did look up the task_struct by pid, but that brought the
system to its knees due to heavy lock contention.
Do you know of a better way of doing this?
