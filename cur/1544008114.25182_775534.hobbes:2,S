Yes, no errors.

No. The Problem occured sometimes shortly after boot (Once even before X was 
up) sometimes only after days of full usage.
Boot starts postgres, thats the only thing that propably always ran. But I 
have seen it while postgres was idle - i.e. just some polls and stats.

Its not a single file, but the whole filesystem, having problems.

Sure, no problem.
At least if the patch is not expensive during run time. The system produces 
test-data for testing our development software and I cant take it down for too 
long.
Thats the reason why I can use something like ext4 on such a system at all ;-)
It sometimes takes quite a while to reproduce the problem though. The system 
ran stable for 4 days so far.
Same kernel as the last time the error occured though.
Any specific debug options I should enable?
