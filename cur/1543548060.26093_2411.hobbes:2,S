I'd like to advocate the inclusion of the majority of these patches of
Andrea's.  I've been patching most of them in for a while now simply
because I've found my SMP system much more stable and useable.
Distinctly lacking from the 2.2.17 release was Marcelo Tosatti's age-old
1-character fix to sync_page_buffers() without which my system is unusable.
(namely, doing WRITEA in the call to ll_rw_block()).  Andrea provides a
similar and cleaner implementation of the entire sync_page_buffers()
function which also works fine.
Debate the more ambitious patches he proposes all you like, all I care
about is the SMP fixes / improvements and the fact that I don't have to
put up with both cpu's going flat out even when the system is, from a
user's perspective, idle.  I don't use initrd, have an AXP (worse luck),
use >2Gb files or LVM.  Although having a 2.3 compatible LVM would not
go astray for a 2.2.x-lmp :)
