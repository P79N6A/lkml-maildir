And if VFS could get access to dentry which was used for statfs,
I (and ncpfs) will be very happy, as then I can report space available
for user after applying directory restrictions just through normal
statfs call, instead of using own special call.
I understand that then it becomes more inode than superblock operation,
and that it is too late for 2.6...
