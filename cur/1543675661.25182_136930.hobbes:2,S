Dave Miller asked me to try this patch. On sparc64, we've had a never
ending battle with ALi 5229 on Sun Blade 100's. After some time, files
would start to get corrupted (in memory, not on disk, unless the
corruption was saved somehow inadvertently). It exposed itself as two
null bytes at the start of a file.
I just tried this patch, and for the first time in a long time, I've
been able to boot with UDMA(66) enabled and not get the corruption.
Usually I can expose the corruption with kernel compiles within 10-60
minutes. I've been running your patch for almost 2 days now, and so far
have not been able get corruption. I even left a looping 2.5.69 compile
going (make clean; make) for over 10 hours.
