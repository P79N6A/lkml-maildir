Here are the few new problems that
I've got:
1. Local APIC stopped working. I know
I have to add "lapic" to the command-line,
but now this doesn't help (in -mm4 either
I think). dmesg says:
---
Kernel command line: ro root=/dev/hdc2 apm=power-off lapic nmi_watchdog=1
...
Local APIC not detected. Using dummy APIC emulation.
---
Is this known? Any other command-line option
to enable it again?
2. Radeon DRM driver stopped working.
dmesg says:
---
Linux agpgart interface v0.100 (c) Dave Jones
agpgart: Detected AMD Irongate chipset
agpgart: Maximum main memory to use for agp memory: 439M
agpgart: AGP aperture is 64M @ 0xe8000000

There are also the older problems to mention,
like an Oops in kprobes:
http://www.uwsg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0411.1/0895.html
(there is also a test-case)
and the memory corruption in smbfs:
http://marc.free.net.ph/message/20041027.000343.74f4a932.html
If either of these problems can be resolved,
I'd be very happy:)
My /proc/config.gz is attached, just in case.
