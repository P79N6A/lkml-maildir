I just reverted the whole commit.
We've had this exact thing before, and it's easy enough to handle, but you 
have to do it right.
The way to handle it is to do
	static inline int maybe_ignored(int arg, ...)
	{
		return arg;
	}
	#define smp_call_function(func,info,retry,wait) \
		maybe_ignored(0, info, retry, wait)
which is a very useful way to say: we don't care about "func", but we want 
to avoid unused warnings for "info", "retry" and "wait", and we want to 
return 0 regardless and compile it all away.
If somebody tests this, puts the "maybe_ignored()" function in some nice 
generic header file, I'll apply it.
I _refuse_ to apply the patch from Andrew that adds "(void)" to shut up 
the compiler. That's a piece of crap, and we should never do things like 
that. Bad C style.
