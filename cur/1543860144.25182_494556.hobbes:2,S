From asking peterz on #mm, I think page_mkclean will do the right
thing and call something like flush_cache_page. I think that resolves
the issue which I think you identified where the end symptom on archs
with virtually tagged caches could be a line of pixels written by
userspace through one PTE remain in-cache and therefore "undisplayed"
when the kernel reads through another PTE that may fall on a different
cacheline.
