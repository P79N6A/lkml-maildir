	   I can reproduce it in a matter of a few seconds with 2.2.7-ac4 and
	   2.2.9-ac1. It seems to loop in truncate_inode_pages() (near the
	   end of the function, according to the System.map file).
Can you give us some sort of hint about how you reproduce it so
quickly?  What kind of activity, and is this on SMP or not?
Later,
