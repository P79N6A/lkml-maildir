But it doesn't make sense - you include a generic configuration option
which people will see, yet it makes no effect on ARM - seems to be rather
silly putting it there in the first place.
Also, do users particularly care what -Os and -O2 mean?
Maybe you need to change init/Kconfig to be something like the following,
and reinstate the change to the ARM makefile:
config OPTIMIZE_FOR_SIZE
	bool "Optimize for size" if EXPERIMENTAL
	default n if !ARM
	default y if ARM
	help
	  Enabling this option will cause the compiler to reduce the code
	  size of the kernel by disabling certain optimisations.  However,
	  the resulting kernel may run faster due to more efficient
	  cache utilisation.
	  If unsure, say N.
