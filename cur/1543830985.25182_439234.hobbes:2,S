What sort of overhead do you have in mind here?
I'm suspecting you mean the mental overhead to the programmer coding
for this, who might complain at having to learn a whole new subsystem
(cpusets) just to say how to group CPUs for collecting these stats.

My natural inclination is to disagree with this.  Increasingly
popular large systems running heterogenous loads benefit from
finer granularity policies.
Though I will be honest in acknowledging that I have not studied
these taskstats in detail, so my inclinations may be off the mark.
