Assigning a parent device will only work with the upcoming conversion of
the raw kobjects in the block subsystem to "struct device".

Why is that here? I don't think we need this when we use the existing:
  kvasprintf(GFP_KERNEL, fmt, args)

Default attributes will need the NULL termination back (see below).

This function should accept a: "struct device *parent" and all callers
just pass NULL until the block layer conversion gets merged.

The parent should be passed here.

All this open-coded attribute stuff should go away and be replaced by:
  bdi_class->dev_attrs = bdi_dev_attrs;
Otherwise at event time the attributes are not created and stuff hooking
into the events will not be able to set values. Also, the core will do
proper add/remove and error handling then.
