Actually its supposed to depend on CONFIG_SA1111, not that random
collection of other symbols.  The following just happened to be a nice
way to specify it under CML1:
if [ "$CONFIG_ASSABET_NEPONSET" = "y" -o \
     "$CONFIG_SA1100_ACCELENT" = "y" -o \
     "$CONFIG_SA1100_ADSBITSY" = "y" -o \
     "$CONFIG_SA1100_BADGE4" = "y" -o \
     "$CONFIG_SA1100_CONSUS" = "y" -o \
     "$CONFIG_SA1100_GRAPHICSMASTER" = "y" -o \
     "$CONFIG_SA1100_JORNADA720" = "y" -o \
     "$CONFIG_SA1100_PFS168" = "y" -o \
     "$CONFIG_SA1100_PT_SYSTEM3" = "y" -o \
     "$CONFIG_SA1100_XP860" = "y" ]; then
   define_bool CONFIG_SA1111 y
   define_int CONFIG_FORCE_MAX_ZONEORDER 9
fi
The conversion should've been:
config FORCE_MAX_ZONEORDER
        int
        depends on SA1111
        default "9"
Even so, my original point remains about the dependency between config
symbols concentrating in one "tweaks" header file leading to the situation
where you change one symbol and everything rebuilds.
