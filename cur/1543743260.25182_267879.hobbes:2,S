The ability to create a nonworkable UML binary is _not_ a kbuild problem, 
especially in the UML case I would expect it should be possible to avoid 
this.

I'm only talking about cross compiling here. From people who do this, I 
sort of expect, that they know what they do. You can misconfigure a kernel 
in native compiles as well, this patch solves the wrong problem. 
E.g. if someone wrote a patch which stores the arch in .config and warns/ 
refuses to load it for a different configuration, I would accept it 
happily.
bye, Roman
