Hi, Ingo:
In my pthread_sync code, I first call refer () subroutine which actually 
establishes the elapsed time (reference time) for non-synchronized 
delay() using the gettimeofday. Then each synchronization overhead value 
is obtained by subtracting the reference time from the elapsed time with 
introduced synchronization. The effect of gettimeofday() should be 
minimal if the time difference (overhead value) is the interest here. 
Unless the gettimeofday behaves differently in the case of running 8 
threads .vs. running 2 threads.
I will try to replace gettimeofday with a lightweight timer call in my 
test code. Thank you very much.
