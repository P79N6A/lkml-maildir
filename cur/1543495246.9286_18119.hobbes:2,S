The thing I'm wondering about is support for the specific RAID-5
features from within the Linux environment. E.g., how is failure of a
drive reported (if at all)?  I'd like a message in the syslog, at the
least... A utility for checking the status / configuring the RAID
subsystem would also be a must; I'd hate having to reboot into DOS or
even --horrors-- NT to do that. Even using the onboard BIOS firmware
isn't something I'd want.
All the RAID controllers I've seen have pretty NT programs for
configuring and monitoring the RAID subsystem, but not for anything
else (except perhaps SCO Unix...)
