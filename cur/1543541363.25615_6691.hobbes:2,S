Subject: [PATCH] Splitting a posix lock causes an infinite loop

Hi Willy,
Chris Yeoh has been doing more Posix compliance testing and managed to find
a test that locked the kernel tight.  Basically, splitting a fcntl lock
(by unlocking the middle of an existing one) would cause a lock to
point to itself in a couple of lists!  The next time you try to take
a lock on the same file, you end up spinning inside the kernel.
(cat'ting /proc/locks was very bad as well! :-))
Please apply this patch:
