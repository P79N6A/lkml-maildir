FWIW, waay back when (sometime last year if memory serves)
Linus suggested changing the default to 0x1000000 for all x86.
The reasoning was some performance microoptimisation regarding
4MB aligned TLBs iirc.
The details have long since evaded my memory, but as an experiment,
I made the change to the Fedora kernel.  FC5,FC6 and F7 have been
this way for a while now, with no obvious problems. Ditto RHEL5.
We did get some performance numbers at the time of the change,
but they weren't amazing (basically in the noise).
Given it never seemed to actually get worse, I never got around
to reverting it..
