Generally on PowerPC you need to use at least the eieio instruction to
prevent reordering of the loads and stores to the device.  It's
possible that 8xx is sufficiently in-order that you get away without
putting in barrier instructions (eieio or sync), but it's not good
practice to omit them.
You can use accessors such as in_be32 and in_le32 in this situation,
when you have a kernel virtual address that is already mapped to the
device.
Regards,
Paul.
