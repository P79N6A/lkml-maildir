For staying up to date I use the following:
# Add Linus's tree as a remote
git remote --add linus
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git
# Add Ingo's tree as a remote
git remote --add x86
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/x86/linux-2.6-x86.git
# With that setup, just run the following to get any changes you
# don't have.  It will also notice any new branches Ingo/Linus
# add to their repo.  Look in .git/config afterwards, the format
# to add new remotes is easy to figure out.
git remote update
Cheers,
Harvey
