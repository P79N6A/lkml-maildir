Well the kernel build process is not supposed to put them there.

You probably also broke it by hand :)
The kernel doesn't have anything to do with /usr/include. The distribution
you use is responsible for that. For example Debian doesn't even HAVE
the asm and linux symlinks in /usr/include - the libc6-dev package
just includes a complete copy of include files from a known-good kernel.
