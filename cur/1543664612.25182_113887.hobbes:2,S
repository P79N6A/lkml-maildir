In general there's also a side effect if acm is uninitialized.
I didn't look at the code in question here.
As for the rest, it's true that we should be able to do this,
but we don't currently have a pass that globally propagates
"trapiness" of memory references.  It would be a useful thing
to have though, particularly for Java, which is required to
arrange for these traps to be able to be caught with exceptions,
and other horrible reordering issues.
