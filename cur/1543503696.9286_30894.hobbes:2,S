This is not quite correct. RT tasks under rtlinux can access all Linux services 
indirectly by passing their requests to Linux processes. For example it is quite
easy to have a linux process log data collected by a rt task and, in fact, this
is probably the most common use of RTLinux right now.

I think that this is confused. Many RT _applications_ include both RT and non RT
components. But hard RT means that the OS guarrantees irq and scheduling latencies to
tasks. This is binary.
