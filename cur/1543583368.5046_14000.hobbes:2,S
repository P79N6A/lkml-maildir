It seems to me that we're stuffing a 32 bit bitmask into an
8 bit register ... which seems very odd. Either I don't understand
this properly (probable ;-)) or something's wrong ... can anyone
shed some light on this for me?
It looks like we do this in arch/i386/kernel/io_apic.c (2.4.x):
-----------------------------------------
#define TARGET_CPUS cpu_online_map
void __init setup_IO_APIC_irqs(void)
{
        struct IO_APIC_route_entry entry;
....
entry.dest.logical.logical_dest = TARGET_CPUS;
....
                io_apic_write(apic, 0x11+2*pin, *(((int *)&entry)+1));
                io_apic_write(apic, 0x10+2*pin, *(((int *)&entry)+0));
---------------------------------------------
But ....
struct IO_APIC_route_entry {
...
    union {
....
            struct { __u32
                    __reserved_1    : 24,
                    logical_dest    :  8;
            } logical;
    } dest;
---------------------------------------------
But cpu_online map seems to be a 32 bit bitmask of which
CPUs are online .... are we stuffing this directly into an 8-bit
logical desitination register?
Ironically, if I'm understanding this right, it kind of works anyway
for most systems - the low nibble of the logical ID is a bitmask
anyway, so it works normally for up to 4 way. For 8 way or more,
the high nibble will be set to 1111, which is the broadcast cluster ID,
so it'll direct interrupts anywhere .... but I can't believe that was
intentional ;-) For a start, a 7 way system would send to some
non-existant cluster ID ....
Any insights would be much appreciated,
Thanks,
Martin.
