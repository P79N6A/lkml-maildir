Subject: help! forcedeth network errors and packet drops - Was: ACPI Standby and nvidia ethernet driver causes network errors and drops

Corrections:
1) It is not the 'nvidia' driver, it is the 'forcedeth' ethernet driver
2) It does _not_ only happen after standby, I have finally experienced
errors and drops without going into standby.
Now, with this said is there anything I can enable in the kernel to
help diagnose the issue. I am currently using 2.6.12-rc5-mm1 on this
computer. I have read that this could be caused by being at the wrong
duplex, which as far as I could tell should be full (that's what all
the other computers on the network seem to be at) but I cannot find
that information nowhere in the /proc at least. I have also changed
the network cable 3 times, which I have also read could have been the
problem.
Also here's some netstat information:
netstat -i:

I have included everything I can think of between these two emails,
feel free to ask for more, or please help.
thanks,
