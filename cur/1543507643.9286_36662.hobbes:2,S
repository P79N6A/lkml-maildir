This is just crap.
You should NOT use bus/slot/fn in the name. For identification purposes,
you can just use the numbers in the "struct pci_dev" thing directly - no
need to try to continually get them into the name, because they are
already available as pure numbers.
Numbers are numbers, and should be of type "int" or similar.
Text is text, and should be of type "char []".
Why do you have this need to mix the two?
