This is'nt 2.3.34.

tea6300 and msp34xx use the same i2c bus address.
With 2.3.33 simply not loading the msp3400 module should fix this.
2.3.34 has a few bits in the tvcards array where you can tell the driver
which audio chips it should look for (and autoload the audio driver module
if found).  This is especially useful for msp3400 vs. tea6300 because of
the address problem.
