I tested it a while back - it worked OK.  If you could retest that'd be
neat.
The journal shouldn't be affected - it's just a regular file.
mke2fs and tune2fs choose an initial journal size based
on the size of the fs, so if you were increasing the
fs size by a large ratio then there may be a case for
increasing the journal size.  But as you've pointed out,
an 8, 16 or 32 megabyte journal covers an awful lot of metadata.
