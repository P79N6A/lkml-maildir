No. FYI, there are hundreds-of-thousands of such "events" per second
of operation! Basically, any time some task is waiting for I/O its
CPU is taken away and given to somebody else. This is what "sleeping"
usually means. Once the I/O completes, the task gets the CPU
again and that's what "running" means. If you were to instrument
these two state-changes for all tasks, it would certainly leave
only a new percent of CPU available for the tasks. This would
royally screw up the meaning of anything you were trying to
instrument.

If you mean the dynamic priority that keeps changing until
the task is executed, no. If you mean priority like
'nice', you can instrument the sys-call.

There is a kernel logging daemon that writes 'printk' messages. This
works by having a user-mode daemon open and read /proc/kmsg. You can
make a similar communications interface, using the existing daemon
as a template, that will instrument anything you want.
