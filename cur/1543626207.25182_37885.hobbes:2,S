I was running ~50Mbps of UDP traffic, bi-directional on an over-night
run.  Machine is Celeron 500 in a FV24 motherboard.
Sometime in the night, this happened:
(Coppied by hand...hope I don't mess up)
EIP:     0010:[<c01ee5c0>]   Not tained
EFLAGS: 00010202
EIP is at udp_rcv [krenel] 0x30
.....
Call Trace [<c01d41b5>] ip_local_deliver [kernel] 0x129
ip_rcv 0x31f
tulip_interrupt 0x549
net_rx_action 0x190
handle_IRQ_event 0x35
do_softirq 0x47
do_IRQ 0x90
call_do_IRQ 0x5
I'll be going back to a newer kernel, but thought this might
interest some folks.
