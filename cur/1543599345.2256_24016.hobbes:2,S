I don't know why you would want to divide by 2048.
Multiply by 512 and find 512*8439184 = 4320862208 bytes.
Since that is more than you thought you had, be happy.

No. There are rounding differences. The disk capacity is not an integral
number of cylinders and you lose if you insist on alignment.
Find a lot of details in the Large Disk Howto.

Well, 1 M = 1000 k by definition of the SI system of units.
This has nothing to do with Linux.
But if you are confused about units, just compute in bytes.
