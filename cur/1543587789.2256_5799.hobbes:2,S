Roman,
 That seems to have done it. I'm now able to mount,read,and write to
affs
file systems. With an scsi zip drive with 3 affs partitions on it and an
affs hardfile(loop) that I use with UAE occasionally. Looks good to me.
I'll be using this functionality quite a bit so I'll notify you of any
anomalies if it's ok. Thank you for your efforts.
Regards
