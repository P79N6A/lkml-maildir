Hmmm, the only problem I can see in the aio code wrt timer usage is 
the following.  Does this patch make a difference?  If not, I'm guessing 
that the problem is something in SMPtimers-A0 that aio happens to 
trigger.  The only timer aio uses is for the timeout when waiting for an 
event, and the structure for that is put on the stack.
