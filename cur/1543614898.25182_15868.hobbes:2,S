OK, so this glorious patchbot is going to make sure that a patch patches
cleanly against a known version and compiles.  And that buys me exactly
what?  Not a heck of a lot.  Especially since, as is obvious, if you send
in stuff that doesn't compile consistently, your patches are likely to go
to the back of the line or just get dropped.

I'd suggest you go try this idea out.  It's funny how often people suggest
that they are going to make the problems go away, it's always this same
proposal, typically nobody does any work, when they do it doesn't get used,
could it be there is a reason for that?
I'm prepared to be wrong, but I don't hear the maintainers asking for this
patchbot.  Why not?
