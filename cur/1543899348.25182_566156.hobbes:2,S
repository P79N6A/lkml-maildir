There's not a lot of those around. Looks like it's probably one of
	init/do_mounts_rd.c:static void __init *malloc(size_t size)
	init/initramfs.c:static void __init *malloc(size_t size)
both of which exist just because those things include "lib/inflate.c".
It's probably do_mounts_rd.c, because initramfs.c defines malloc/free 
before the #include, and I would have expected gcc to just inline them in 
that case.
That's probably the right thign to do in do_mounts_rd.c too, rather than 
adding any kmalloc_track_caller() stuff.
