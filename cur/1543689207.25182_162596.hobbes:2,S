The old serial.c did that as well - its mainly there so we don't go
overboard and inline stuff when it isn't necessary.  From what I
remember when this was discussed some time ago, 386 and 486 performs
better when they have the interrupt handling as one function, but
other CPUs perform better when the code is out of line.
Since people tend to care about getting good performance from their
serial ports, I preserved this trick.
