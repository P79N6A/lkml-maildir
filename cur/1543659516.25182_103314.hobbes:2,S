Does this work, or would you like more detail?
config IPMI_HANDLER
       tristate 'IPMI top-level message handler'
       help
         This enables the central IPMI message handler, required for IPMI
         to work.  Note that you must have this enabled to enable any
         other IPMI things.  IPMI is a standard for managing sensors
         (temperature, voltage, etc.) in a system.  If you don't know
         what it is, your system probably doesn't have it and you can
         ignore this option.  See Documentation/IPMI.txt for more
         details on the driver.
