A very similar thing happens on my laptop. Before the shutdown,
the previous driver puts the chip into D3 power state, and after
reboot the pci_enable_device cannot take it out from there,
because eepro refuses to wake from D3 to D0.
It will go from D3 to D2 and from D2 to D0 though.
Try the attached patch, please. I do not promise it will work,
but it may be worth trying.
