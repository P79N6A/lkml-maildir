How hard would it be to allow the kernel to take two initrd parameters.
I.e. load two initrd images. 
This would allow initrd to be broken into an image for tools and multiple
images for the drivers required for booting (only one of which would be
used). The end result is that only the required drivers need to be loaded
into the RAM disk.
