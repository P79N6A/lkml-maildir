Ben had suggested a sysctl tunable, well it turns out that that
isn't even implementable.
It's actually impossible to change the size of the TCP established
hash table at run time.
It has to do with per-hashchain locking.  Every possible scheme fails
in one way or another.
So at best we could provide a boot time option, but thats about the
extent of it.  I have no problem with this though, anyone is free to
send me privately patches to do that. :-)
Franks a lot,
