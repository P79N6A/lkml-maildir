Ok, understood. While waiting for a 'proper' infrastructure', maybe
a simple cron entry will do the job ? (since the bk pull from your
private tree on bkbits to the public tree on bkbits is not supposed
to ever fail or have merge errors...)
Anyway, just did a 'bk pull' once again and noticed than linux.bkbits.net
has again the latest version. Thanks! (or thanks Larry, whatever is 
more appropriate :-)).
Stelian.
