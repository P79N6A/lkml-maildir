well, so far, reading back I have seen a few different things. some people
copy files and see bits flipped; others see complete FS go to no-no land.
what if the hypothetical issue is problems with scsi _and_ quotas ?
anyways. what I can and will do is ask all the reported people I know of,
the type of scsi controller and if they used quoptas or not. maybe this
could give more insight.
people are welcome to mail me privately to :
ext2fail@grobbebol.xs4all.nl
and this address also will be used to gather statistics for people that
don't react by themselves :-) (e.g. the ones that have written about the 
corruption will receive a mail as well)
