On my version of 2.3.43 sg.c lines 1091 and 1092 read:
    size = sizeof(Sg_device) *
           (sg_template.dev_noticed + SG_EXTRA_DEVS);
and compiles. Notice SG_EXTRA_DEVS not CONFIG_SD_EXTRA_DEVS. I recently
downloaded the whole 14 MBytes of 2.3.42 and then used a patch 
from a mirror site to go to 2.3.43 . There is a lot of changes in 
sg in that patch but that doesn't explain way you have a corrupted 
version. Also patch-2.3.43 mentions SG_EXTRA_DEVS and not 
CONFIG_SD_EXTRA_DEVS for the line in question.
Did you get the complete linux-2.3.43 source? If so this may 
indicate a difference between 2.3.42+patch2.3.43 and the
linux-2.3.43 source.
