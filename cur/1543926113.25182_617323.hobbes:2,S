Hello Alan,
in the meantime I tried the kernels 2.6.23.1 as well as 2.6.24-rc2. Both
show the same behaviour when using libata with AMD/NVIDIA PATA support:
GPCMD_SET_STREAMING via SG_IO doesn't have any effect. With these two
kernels I didn't try the "old" ATA driver - but I assume it would've
worked out (changing your system from ATA to libata and vice versa
turned out to be quite time consuming ;)).
Regards
Sebastian
