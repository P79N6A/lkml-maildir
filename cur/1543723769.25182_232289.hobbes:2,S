It's quite some effort to update those specific machines, but we planned
to update to 2.6.7 until we heared that there are some problems with
this version (especially, a co-worker of mine trying 2.6.7-mm1 on a
similar hardware and using both crypto-loop and highmem has had random
crashes, and some apps (including sun jdk 1.4) segfaulting on startup.).
Now we plan to update to some 2.6.6 version. Is dm-crypt considered
stable enough to give it a test shot? This way, we could get rid of
crypto-loop and thus avoid having to try the mm patches.
Thanks,
Markus
