Are you sure that this is not some hardware contingency? I.e. cachelines 
are prioritized according to cpu number or some such thing? Switch the 
timer interrupt to a different cpu and see how this affects the 
situation.

Properly synchronized means completely in step.

In practice we have seen the time jump forward to A.D. 2587 which then 
results in tcp retransmits periods of a few centuries. I'd strongly advise 
against nojitter unless you know that the ITCs are in step. Isnt the 
hardware capable of making them run in step? It seems that some i386 
BIOSes have accomplished just that.
Note that the time subsystem for ia64 is not based on microseconds like 
i386 but on nanoseconds. clock_gettime will return nanosecond resolution 
which WILL become negative with devastating consequence if the clock 
jumps back a microsecond. A single ia64 processor can do multiple calls 
to retrieve time from user space within a microsecond.
The jitter compensation avoids the problems arising with time for ITC.
