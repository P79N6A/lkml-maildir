Holy Shit!
I just tried the libata driver and it ROCKSSSS! So far, at least.
I already wrote about the crappy SiI3112 ide driver, now with libata I 
get >60mb/sec!!!! More then I get with windows.
Also tests with dd. This rocks. Lets see whether it likes swsup, as well...
So folks, try libata, as well.
I dunno what all is actuall needed. I enabled scsi, scie disk, scsi 
generic, sata and its driver. In grub I appended "doataraid noraid".
YES!
