This one is good.

Quick grep shows 'H' namespace is kinda-sorta divided between some bluetooth
headers, hiddev.h (as was correctly noted) and sound SNDRV_*. Of course,
it's worse because ALSA and hiddev.h ioctls conflict pretty often.
Was second column "Seq#" meant to be central registration point of new
ioctls? If it's, boundaries are not obeyed and comments like
	/*
	 * IOCTLS (0x00 - 0x7f)
	 */
should be removed probably from everywhere to not give false sense of
ownership TOGETHER with rejecting every new conflicting ioctl.
