Of the pair of machines, I upgraded one of them to GCC 3.0.4, while
leaving the other at 2.95.3.
The identical source and config file compiles fine on the one, but not on
the other. It gives that exec_domain slew.c of errors.
So is this a GCC bug that I have located, or something more with the
kernel?, as Documentation/Changes lists GCC 2.95.3 at the minimal version
required.
I would like to avoid the GCC3 tree as it stands presently, as I have some
C++ code that can not be ported at this time to work with GCC3, and only
works with GCC2.95.3.
Any ideas?
Thanks in advance.
