gcc correctly tells that at least a part of this patch incorrect (not 
that gcc says "is used", not "might be used"):
<--  snip  -->
...
  CC      fs/jffs/inode-v23.o
fs/jffs/inode-v23.c: In function 'jffs_create':
fs/jffs/inode-v23.c:1282: warning: 'inode' is used uninitialized in this function
...
<--  snip  -->
Looking at the code, it's trivial to verify that gcc is right.
