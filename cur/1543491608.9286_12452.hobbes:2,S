OK, so you can reproduce these on demand?  Could you try again, with the
kernel patch below in place?  It should at least give us a hint as to
whether we're looking at a memory scribble or a genuine VM-related fault
somewhere.  Could you also forward me your .config?
Finally, is there any other odd behaviour visible on your machine?  It
is hard to see where this message has started coming from if nothing
else is breaking.
Cheers,
 Stephen
