No, no, no.
If you optimize something, say a file-system by having the indirect blocks
next to the data blocks, you want to make sure, that 
(a) this happens as often as possible
(b) this fast path is executed as fast as possible
And you want to add
(c) don't optimize the slow path in order to provide motivation for people
    to fix the FS further to avoid it completely
You are right, if the slow path could be avoided completely by proper design.
In the FS, like in the spinlock case, it can't!
There are 8-way (and more) machines out there and you will have a hard time
to avoid spinlock contention completely, if you are I/O bound. So why not
decrease the bad effects of spinlock contention?
