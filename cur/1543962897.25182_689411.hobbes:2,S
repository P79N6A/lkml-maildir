I have no problem with that name, I can rename the files.

I currently mentioned memory, since we have the infrastructure to group using
mm->owner infrastructure. For other purposes, we'll need to enhance the
controller quite a bit. That is why I put memory related in brackets.

limit_in_bytes and usage_in_bytes to add an as_ prefix, so that the UI clearly

I used RLIMIT since I want to extend it later to control memory locked pages :)
I open to other names as well.
