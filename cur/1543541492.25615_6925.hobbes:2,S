And people who write programs on Linux that utilise the streams would have
to be well aware of this, otherwise their programs would be inherently
broken.

It's essential under MacOS, because it's the only means to identify a file
(or at least, the only means the OS uses). Under Unix, it'd be an
overriding method ("if it's there, and we understand it, then use it"),
but not a required method. Programs that depended on the streams being
there wouldn't be particularly widely-used, because they wouldn't work all
that well.
