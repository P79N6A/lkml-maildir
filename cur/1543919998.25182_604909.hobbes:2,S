In unionfs_writepage() I tried to emulate as best possible what the lower
f/s will have returned to the VFS.  Since tmpfs's ->writepage can return
AOP_WRITEPAGE_ACTIVATE and re-mark its page as dirty, I did the same in
unionfs: mark again my page as dirty, and return AOP_WRITEPAGE_ACTIVATE.
Should I be doing something different when unionfs stacks on top of tmpfs?
(BTW, this is probably also relevant to ecryptfs.)
Thanks,
Erez.
