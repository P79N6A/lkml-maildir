As I can see, this patch adds 2 user visible changes. I am
not arguing, but probably it makes sense to document this.
Before this patch, fcntl(F_GETOWN) returns the same pid that
was given to fcntl(F_SETOWN). Now it returns 0 if there were
no process/group with such a pid when F_SETOWN was called.
The second change is good (I'd say this is bugfix). It is
not possible anymore to send the signal to not yet created
processes via fcntl(F_SETOWN, last_pid + a_little), or hit
a problem with pid re-use.
Oleg.
