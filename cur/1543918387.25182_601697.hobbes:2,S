Well.  If people actually use it I suspect it will work ok.  The
circuitry is quite simple so as long as people get their requirements
straight we should be fine.  Which is why I tried to get everything
working as well as we could sooner rather then later.  Of course
drivers are free not to call anything that would cause the irq
to be masked.
That said the current disable_irq and enable_irq path is using the
IRQF_PENDING infrastructure on x86.  So the only time this comes up
is for irq migration.
