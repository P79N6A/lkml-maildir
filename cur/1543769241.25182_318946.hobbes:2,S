Then the problem is probably with your ALSA configuration, or (less
likely) an ALSA bug.  I suspect your MP3s are 44100 KHz and they are
being played at 48000 KHz.  Please try ALSA CVS, there have been many
improvements since the version in the kernel.  If the problem persists,
report it on the alsa-user list.
