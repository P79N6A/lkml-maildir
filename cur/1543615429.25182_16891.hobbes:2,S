Well my hardware is an Elitegroup, AMI-BIOS, with a SiS735. The AC'97 
codec chip, which doesn't
get recognized properly by linux, is a avance logic (AL107) chip. The 
whole thing  is running
at a fixed 48000 Hz clock, which is derived from the USB host bridge.
XMMS is working fine, since it does understand the issue of fixed 
frequency PCM
decoders. mplayer is usable with -ao sdl:esd, aka. piping the output 
through esd, since the
esd doesn't have problems with fixed chip codecs. However the sound 
frequency
transponder in ESD is really navie. It doesn't do any true filtering 
apparently, so
one can hear the overleap frequency from 44.1 kHZ to 48kHz for
example. The artsd from KDE as usuall is failing blatantly and locks the 
system hard...
And I don't have neither the time, nor inclination for debuggin it...
(Unless I could compile the whole KDE proerply with some recent gcc-3.x 
for RedHat ;-).
Recodring did lockup the system hard as well immediately, no matter what.
However I will certainly try the whole again, since it would be really 
nice to have the whole
stuff running properly under KDE. I'm not going to use GNOME in no time ;-).
