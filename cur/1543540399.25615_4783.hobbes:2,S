As a relative newbie to unix platforms I need help on a pretty trivial subject.
 I need a lilo.conf script where I can have the option of loading the original
kernel 2.2.14 or the new kernel 2.4.0 test5.  I have compiled the new kernel
and had to use bzImage as my zImage was too big.  In other words how do I
configure /etc/lilo.conf so I can choose which kernel to boot?  (just in case)
Thanks 
Don
