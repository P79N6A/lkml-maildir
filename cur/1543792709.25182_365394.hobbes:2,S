I thought the intention was to have file descriptors referring to files, 
not directories, to represent the directories they are in.  In those 
cases simply using /proc/PID/fd/N/some/more/dirs wouldn't work and 
neither does /proc/PID/fd/N/../some/more/dirs.
Looking at the Sol man page again it seems they don't allow this case 
but this has to be guessed from the error codes, not the description. 
In this case the /rpco approach should be OK.
But there are always people questioning the use of /proc.  We already 
have quite a few such cases and adding more is no issue for me, but not 
relying on /proc would appease some people.
