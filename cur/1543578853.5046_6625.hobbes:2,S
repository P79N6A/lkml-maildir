::nods:: Yes, I realize that there are other low-end SMP boards
categorized trash, but when someone asks me what low-end SMP motherboard
to get, the first thing I tell them is to /not/ get the BP6.

If you think that a stream of APIC retries is 'working very well,' then
I'm sorry to say, you've got another thing coming. :p Besides, a 40 day
uptime is *not* all that spectacular; I've had uptimes in excess of 200
days before, running on garbage hardware (worse than even the BP6).
anyways, the fact remains that it was your motherboard that is causing
these errors. The retries are still there in 2.2, they just aren't
reported.
