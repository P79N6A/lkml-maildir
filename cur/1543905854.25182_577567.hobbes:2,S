Scratch that.  When I wrote the first note, I was at home, and the TPM chip
did its PNP thing and became 00:0e.  I failed to notice that in my reply,
I was at work, and the printer port on the docking station became 00:0e and
the TPM became 00:0f.
% cat /sys/devices/pnp0/00:0f/id
BCM0102
PNP0c31
% cat /sys/devices/pnp0/00:0f/resources 
state = active
io 0xcb0-0xcbb
mem 0xfed40000-0xfed44fff
So there *isn't* an IRQ assigned.  When I tried the patch you sent,
I added a few debugging printk's, thusly:
        if (interrupts)
                chip->vendor.irq = irq;
printk(KERN_DEBUG "in tis_init, interrupts=%d irq=%d\n",interrupts,irq);
        if (interrupts && !chip->vendor.irq) {
                chip->vendor.irq =
                    ioread8(chip->vendor.iobase +
                            TPM_INT_VECTOR(chip->vendor.locality));
printk(KERN_DEBUG "after ioread8, interrupts=%d irq=%d\n",interrupts,chip->vendor.irq);
                for (i = 3; i < 16 && chip->vendor.irq == 0; i++) {
[ 1971.644193] in pnp_init, start=fed40000 len=5000 irq=-1
[ 1971.650907] tpm_tis 00:0f: 1.2 TPM (device-id 0x1001, rev-id 2)
[ 1971.650923] in tis_init, interrupts=1 irq=-1
[ 1971.650929] tpm_tis 00:0f: Unable to request irq: -1 for use
and it loads immediately.
I thought that !chip->vendor.irq looked like a wrong test, because if the
chip says '-1' meaning "no default assigned", and conversely, if the chip
had a positive number, we should be *using* that IRQ if we can, rather than
looping from 3 to 15 looking for one. So I tried it with (chip->vendor.irc < 0),
and this happened:
[ 2254.834377] in pnp_init, start=fed40000 len=5000 irq=-1
[ 2254.840422] tpm_tis 00:0f: 1.2 TPM (device-id 0x1001, rev-id 2)
[ 2254.840438] in tis_init, interrupts=1 irq=-1
[ 2254.840443] after ioread8, interrupts=1 irq=15
[ 2254.840457] tpm0 (IRQ 15) handled a spurious interrupt
[ 2256.839077] tpm_tis 00:0f: tpm_transmit: tpm_send: error -62
[ 2376.771347] tpm_tis 00:0f: tpm_transmit: tpm_send: error -62
Or am I wrong in thinking chip->vendor.irq == -1 means "Pick me an IRQ",
but instead means "I don't do that IRQ thing"? If so, maybe what we need
to be doing is something like:
	if (chip->vendor.irq == -1)
		interrupts = 0;
and force the use of interrupts off and do polling only?
