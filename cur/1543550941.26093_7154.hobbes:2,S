Well, there's already firewire support in general...  It would
definitely be a block device, since Firewire is basically the next SCSI
(large nubers of devices peer-to-peer (i.e. chained and hubless)
architecture, fast communications) witht he major improvements of speed,
connector size and hot-swappability.  Is the firewire driver not
backported to 2.2?  It's definitely in 2.3/2.4 series.
