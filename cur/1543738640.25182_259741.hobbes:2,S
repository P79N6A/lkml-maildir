make clean and oldconfig cleaned up little, but I still get
following linking error (without my patch).
# grep HPET .config
# CONFIG_HPET is not set
# grep HPET autoconf.h
#undef CONFIG_HPET
  LD      .tmp_vmlinux1
arch/x86_64/kernel/built-in.o(.init.text+0x2071): In function
`late_hpet_init':
arch/x86_64/kernel/entry.S:259: undefined reference to `hpet_alloc'
Andi, one thing I am not sure is - do you want entire routine
late_hpet_init() under CONFIG_HPET or only parts of it ?
Thanks,
Badari
