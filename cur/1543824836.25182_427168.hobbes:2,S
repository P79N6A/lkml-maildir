Ah, not yet, but i can provide such.
Right now, i see the drive (with Zang's patch), but any attempt to access it
get me : 
ata1: status=0x50 {DriveReady SeekComplete }
ata1: error=0x01 {AddrMarkNotFound }
sata_mv: PCI ERROR; PCI IRQ cause=0x00000400
sda: Current: sensekey: No Sense
   Additional sense: No Additional sense information
The disk is a hitachi 80GB sata one.
I will compile a kernel with debug output and provide more info in a bit.
Friendly,
Sven Luther
