The thing is that asking for a module is the only thing we can do here.
We can dress it up and give it some special coding to not cause
problems, but the code will always be "ask userspace to load
mmc_block", even if we replace "mmc_block" with "mmc:foobargazonk".
Given that, do you have any preferences for a solution? If we cannot
simply have "mmc_block", then I'm leaning to "mmc:block" for now. The
contents of the aliases is just an opaque string as far as userspace is
concerned, right?
