With a directory, you lose the information of in which order the patches
have been applied - unless of course you resort to file dates or some such.
I agree that one file is very problematic wrt. patch(1), but I was hoping
there would be a way to persuade patch into doing the right thing.
Anyway, I think these kind of issues are solveable if only anybody agrees
this is a good idea...

Yep.
To get back to the original subject: I often compile test kernels and use a
ext2 fs on a cdr as the root fs. I put the tested kernel on a floppy (1)
with cp bzImage /dev/fd0. And then when I finally come up with something
interested I usually find my self pondering is this this or that kernel on
this floppy... In that case the /proc/config thing (and /proc/patches or
whatever) is very useful.
(I admit I should be using lilo on the floppy, and the next problem I hit is
finding the right System.map, which /proc/* won't solve, but...)

(1) Is there a way to make ext2 fs cd bootable? I know I can do that with
iso fs cd (with the el torido boot image), but I've found no way to do that
with other filesystems.
