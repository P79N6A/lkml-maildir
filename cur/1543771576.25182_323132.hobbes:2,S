Yes that's what I'm asking, mainly the pulling of multiple trees into
one tree for giving to Linus, for Andrew I'm quite happy to have him
pull multiple HEADs from the one tree assuming I don't have many
interdependencies between trees...
Say I want something like this one tree with
drm-2.6 - HEAD <- linus tree
            - drm-via < a via driver
            - drm-initmap 
                      - drm-savage <- a savage driver that depends on
the drm-initmap tree
How would I construct such a beast, how does it work out from where to
branch, can I branch a branch for something like drm-savage so I can
say send Linus the initmap branch and then have -mm pulling the savage
one...
if that makes any sense :-)
Dave.
