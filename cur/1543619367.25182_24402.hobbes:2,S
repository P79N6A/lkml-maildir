Haven't seen this posted yet, so I'm surprised to report that
several 2.5.3 source files
    arch/arm/mach-clps711x/dma.c
    drivers/base/core.c
    drivers/base/fs.c
    drivers/video/neofb.c
try to include linux/malloc.h
but there is no file in the include directory by that name.
I worked around the problem by copying an older linux/malloc.h:
#ifndef _LINUX_MALLOC_H
#define _LINUX_MALLOC_H
#include <linux/slab.h>
#endif /* _LINUX_MALLOC_H */
and I've noticed that many source files have
  #include <linux/slab.h>     /* kmalloc(), kfree() */
instead of trying to include linux/malloc.h
What's the story/direction the code is taking?
