Subject: [PATCH] 2.4.0-test6-pre8 - dark vga textmode console problem in RIVA TNT 2
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2000/8/8/145

Fixes the problem of getting a dark text mode console after switching
from X, under systems which have the RIVA TNT 2 chipset (could be other
systems as well, didn't check). More details about the problem was
posted by me in lkml a few days ago.
This patch was tested and it works. The problem could have been sorted
out in another way, but I'm not much of a skilled kernel hacker to find
out how, although I guess it is somewhere in the code that handles the 
RIVA TNT 2 chipset.
