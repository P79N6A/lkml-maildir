Normally it should not, actually.  pcmcia_init() doesn't check or
allocate any resources until the cardmgr daemon is started.  I also
try not to rely on other drivers correctly allocating device resources
anyway, since the Linux resource maps are generally incomplete.

bulkmem is not a driver, it is a middle-layer for accessing memory
cards.
The wrong thing about one_driver_at_a_time is that it will be quite
confusing for people who want to use PCMCIA, if one (or a few) drivers
are found in the kernel tree, and the rest are elsewhere.
And there are still decisions to be made.  Like, drivers/net/pcmcia
seems sensible, but do we also want to mirror that in the module tree
with /lib/modules/.../net/pcmcia?  Or do they go in modules/.../net,
or modules/.../pcmcia?  This impacts the user-mode PCMCIA stuff, so
I'd want to be involved in that decision, rather than having people
dropping PCMCIA drivers into the kernel tree as they see fit.
