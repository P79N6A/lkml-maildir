Tried a late model ac kernel and 2.4.4pre3. The ac kernel seems to
have a somewhat re-organised atyfb driver. Both fail dismally - I
see 'flashes' on the screen when typing stuff but the screen is
essentially blank. vesafb worked for the minute or two during which
I tested it but I couldn't get x running on top of the framebuffer
so I've gone back to normal vga console stuff and using a ati X
driver. Interestingly, the atyfb driver reported my card as 'PCI'
instead of AGP. Device ID is 4c4d. Machine is a Dell latitude CPt S600Gt.
I'd be keen to hear if anyone gets it working ...
