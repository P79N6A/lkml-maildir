Let me add some more notes:
The linux NFS server interface is unnecessarily complex and will make it 
a lot harder than a "single line change" to make the filesystem correct in case
Linux likes to benefit from the inode numbers in RRip 1.12 to support correct 
hardlinks. 
If you believe that you understand the NFS server issues, you should fix the 
code so that NFS exports will work correctly after the change. If you don't know
what's going on there, you may need to spend a few days with testing and 
debugging.
Note that you need to be able to "re-open" any file from a NFS file handle only...
There are many constraints that need to be redeemed and the new algorithm needs 
to work correctly with old and with new media.
And finally a note to Alan Cox:
Instead of being unwilling to follow the Nettiquette by removing people from the
To: list with your replies and instead of sending useless replies that don't help
people, you should better stay quiet.
