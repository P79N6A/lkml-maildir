This item (and more generally the precedent it sets) will soon have a
disastrous effect on the Linux community, even though it is not
_directly_ a Linux problem.
Most of you have seen my LKML posting: (most of the tech details)

"IBM T40 _refusing_ to boot with "unauthorized" mini-PCI wifi card"
As I gather more info, it becomes clear that the IBM T40 has a TCPA chip
in it with a "white list" of _allowed_ cards.  Apparently IBM has made a
_policy_ decision to disallow any wifi card not on the list. (more
below).  In doing this they have (perhaps unknowingly) severely limited
the usefulness of the entire T40 (and X31 by extension) laptop lines for
the many users of the Linux OS on those IBM systems.  Surely this was
not intentional....
The solution is a very simple removal of the white list from the BIOS.
_telling_ your customers what they may or may not put in a standard PC
expansion slot at the BIOS level (regardless of OS) is going to be a
disaster...

I've tried several variations on this theme, to no avail.  The TCPA chip
was initially not activated, and the 1802 error occurs.  Activating the
chip, and then clearing its settings (all via the BIOS) does nothing.
If the "IBM High Rate Wireless" (22P7701) is in the system, you get the
1802 error before you can even access the BIOS.
So, there indeed must be a "white list" (of what can be put in a
standard expansion slot!)

PCMCIA cards are not affected, because we all _know_ these are for
peripheral expansion.  But we also all know that mini-PCI is also a
technology to allow expansion of laptops.

I don't want the card to be "supported" by IBM, I just want the card
"authorized".  Linux already has support for prism2 cards, but will not
have 802.11a or 802.11g support in the foreseeable future (and only "a"
and "g" cards are on the white list).

Again, the Linux community doesn't need support, just authorization.

The key thing to keep in mind is that while the affects Linux users
rather adversely, it is really a BIOS and _policy_ issue.  This would
happen if one got a T40 with winXP and put in any 802.11b card.

well Alex, perhaps you can paste this whole letter in...
