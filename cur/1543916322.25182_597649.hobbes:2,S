This is the previous __KERNEL__ block.

And this  one shouldn't extent iver the declarations of sys_iopl
and sys_rt_sigactions I think.  If it should be there at all.
So please make this file at least semi-clean while you're at it instead

The __KERNEL__ block should also be extended over the various __ARCH_WANT_
definitions because they're not for userspace at all.
