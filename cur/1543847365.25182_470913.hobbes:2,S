No, that was not the reason. It does not hurt anything, when the
clocksource changes during bootup. You simply replace one read out
device by another one.
The reason was that we wanted to select clocksources as late as
possible, as we wanted to have late init clocksources ready and TSC
problems outruled.

Early bootup Instrumentation is really not a good argument to make that
fragile time related stuff even more complex. There is no problem to
register reliable clocksources in early bootup, but do not make this
mandatory. Not every system is an ARM SoC, where you can and must rely
on the one source which is available usually right when the CPU comes
up.
Early bootup instrumentation can very well go with none or coarse
grained time information, if there is a need to have early boot
intstrumentation at all.
