No.

Same idea here.

Argh! That seems really stupid thing to do, as it makes it difficult to 
interpret what the highest_vcn/lowest_vcn field of attribute extents is 
supposed to mean!?!
This does however explain some of the code uglyness I have seen (and chosen 
to ignore) in the ntfs.sys disassembly run list handling...

No solution. I wasn't aware this could happen. I knew a compression block 
could be split in it halves but I didn't realize this braindamaged 
complication.
I guess we will have to decode the whole run list in one go then. Anything 
else would be slower over all. - What we could do of course is to walk the 
mapping pairs array real quick not reading the numbers only to get the 
correct starting offset into the next extent and then only decode that one 
but that would mean walking the mapping pairs array repeatedly (once to get 
each extent) which would be overall slower than just getting the lot at 
once. - I maintain that we should do this on demand and not on inode open, 
though. - I will have another think about this, but if it is true that NT 
splits the records anywhere, then it would be impossible to start at any 
extent other than the first one.
