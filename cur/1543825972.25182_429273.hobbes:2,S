Subject: non-scalar ktime addition and subtraction broken

The use of 64-bit additions and subtractions on something which is
nominally a struct containing 32-bit second and nanosecond field is
broken when a negative time is involved.  When the structure is
treated as a 64-bit integer, the increment of the upper 32 bits that's
part of two's-complement subtraction is lost.  This leaves the end
result off by one second.
This manifested itself with sleeps inside UML lasting about 1 second
shorter than expected.
The patch below is more a problem statement than a real fix.  People
thought about performance, and I don't know what this does to that
work.
I'm not sure why the hrtimer.c part is needed - I had done that before
tracking down the ktime_add problem.  I see short sleeps without it,
so it is needed somehow.
The ktime_sub piece was done for completeness - UML compiles and boots
with no apparent ill effects, but it's otherwise untested.
As an aside, I fail to see how it can be correct for ktime_sub to add
NSEC_PER_SEC to something without compensating somewhere else for it.
Andrew - please don't drop this into -mm without an OK from Thomas or
someone else who's familiar with this code :-)
