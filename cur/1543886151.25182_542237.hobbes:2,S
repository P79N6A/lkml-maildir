Just remembered this mail from a few days ago, and how puzzled I'd been
by your last sentence or two: I seem to be reading it in the wrong way,
and don't understand why users of SMP kernels will be moving to UP?
UP in the sense of one processor but many cores?  But that still needs
an SMP kernel to use all those cores.  Or you're thinking of growing
virtualization?  Would you please explain further?
Thanks,
Hugh
