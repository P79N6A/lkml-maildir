Let's do the conservative thing and add a new primitive.
[PATCH] Added BARF_ON/BARF_ON_ONCE
The description of CONFIG_BUG clearly states that both BUG and
WARN_ON may be skipped.  However, our actual implementation still
checks the condition on WARN_ON if it's used as part of an if
statement or such.
I tried to compile it away but Matt Mackall pointed out that
people may already be using it in ways that were not intended.
In particular, it may have been used for conditions that are
thought to be possible.
So this patch adds a new pair of macros BARF_ON and BARF_ON_ONCE
that are clearly marked as such to prevent abuse.  The intended
usage model is identical to WARN_ON except that they should only
be used for conditions that are thought to be impossible.  In
other words, only use them to replace BUG_ON's that may be called
by an IRQ handler or within locks.
