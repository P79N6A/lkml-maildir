Hi,
here is a Linux Kernel USB definition of the LaCie USB CDRW burner. This 
was missing from linux/drivers/usb/storage/unusual_devs.h, so the drive was 
recognized by USB, but not properly installed by the USB SCSI emulation.
I tested only reading yet, but I think writing works, too. Will be tested 
soon. I have an old model of 1999 with USB 1, 2x/2x/4x, and no FireWire 
Combo. The USB one is mainly used by Apple folks for CD burning, and will 
make those people happy. Current model can be found at

This should be a fix to the LaCie USB burner trouble that has been reported 
in September 2002 to linuxppc-user.
