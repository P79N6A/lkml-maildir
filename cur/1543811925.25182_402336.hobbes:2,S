That I don't know so I can't comment at the moment. I haven't seen 
anything on linux-security-modules recently?

I know all that, but it is a complicated matter to discuss. That's why I 
was planning to make a comprehensive announcement which would discuss most 
of the hot topics. Ideally yes, I would like to merge, but it won't happen 
now. The first thing I would like to do is establish common ground with 
other security vendors so that we could approach the problem together. 
Personaly, I am not sure whether insisting that everything should be a 
part of kernel is a right thing to do even though I think I understand all 
the up- and down-sides of both policies.
Having said all this above, I am afraid that there will be no other choice 
but to start working on the announcement asap. :)

Of course. Kernel component might be known to some as Talpa and it is 
released under GPL.
