If I do cat /dev/tty1 on /dev/tty2, I see what I write to /dev/tty1 on /dev/tty2, but I don't see what I write to /dev/tty1 while working in /dev/tty1 (all the input is being printed on /dev/tty2) . And besides, I only see the input I type, not the output of f.ex a command (on /dev/tty2). I want to monitor users and log everything that is done on a specific tty when they log in.
