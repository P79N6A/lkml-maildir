Check out panic. All it does (and all it's supposed to do) is
write a message and halt the machine. Panic doesn't 'save' anything. It
doesn't have any information to, as you say, save.
NORET_TYPE void panic(const char * fmt, ...)
{
        static char buf[1024];
        va_list args;
        va_start(args, fmt);
        vsprintf(buf, fmt, args);
        va_end(args);
        printk(KERN_EMERG "Kernel panic: %s\n",buf);
        if (current == task[0])
                printk(KERN_EMERG "In swapper task - not syncing\n");
        else if (in_interrupt())
                printk(KERN_EMERG "In interrupt handler - not syncing\n");
        else
                sys_sync();
        unblank_console();
        Then do auto-restart if enabled.
If you want a stack-trace and register dump, you have to get those
from the page-fault handler (for nonexistant pages). This is where
all the required information is available. This is why, to get this
information, a deliberate trap is set in the code. When reviewing
the resulting information, you ignore the page-fault of a nonexitant
page. You are, instead, interested in the code leading up to the
decision to deliberately crash.
Cheers,
