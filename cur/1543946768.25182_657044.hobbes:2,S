Indeed.

The initial intent of this was to make it harder for malicious code to
attack via the vsysall area.
But you are right, the code is indeed fundamentally unsafe in various
aspects:
1) the patching code runs without synchronizing other CPUs
2) it inserts NOPs even if there is no clock source which provides
vread
3) when the clock source changes to one without vread we run in
exactly the same problem as in #2
The correct solution is randomizing that area, but that's definitely
not an ad hoc fix.
Thanks for pointing this out. I'm looking into fixing this ASAP.
