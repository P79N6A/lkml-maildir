The overall current state of EXPERIMENTAL in the tree is, quite frankly,
somewhere between a complete crock and a wheelbarrow full of bovine fertilizer.
There's a lot of things labeled EXPERIMENTAL that shouldn't be, and a lot of
bleeding edge things that may eat your disks and cause your dog to turn green
that aren't labelled EXPERIMENTAL.
Having said that, I have *no* idea what state the snapshot code is in, but I
have approximately zero confidence that the EXPERIMENTAL tag tells me anything
actually useful about the snapshot code.
