Hi,
 I found this this morning on an AMD X2 based system that was unresponsive:
<....this part of the oops was lost off of the top of the screen, then>

I copied this from a picture I took of the screen. I'm not sure there is enough there to be of any use.
It looks like the system was recording a tv show from a BT878 card at the time, using mencoder. Everything
is compiled into the kernel, no modules. I haven't seen Oops prior to this on this system. If this
is of any use, let me know and I can provide more details on the system - or anything else that might help.
  Thanks,
    Art Smith
