I've managed to mount the initramfs with MS_BIND into my root fs and
found why /sbin/hotplug cannot be run currently. There is some 
off-by-one bug during file extraction that causes the first byte 
of the file to get left out. I.e. the file starts with "ELF\001"
instead of "\577ELF".
This may or may not be related to another off-by-one bug that I'm
seeing sometime when unpacking initramfs on s390x ("panic: length 
error").
The patch below is how I hacked prepare_namespace() to keep 
initramfs visible after boot.
