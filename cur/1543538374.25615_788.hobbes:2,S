If the kernel does not kill some processes (or one process) when the
system is under OOM, probably all the system will lockup because there is
no memory and no more swap space left.  Your chance to start a shell and
kill the memory hog is gone.
Now _which_ process(es) the kernel should choose to kill is a different
issue. 
If you do not like the current OOM killer (I think you dont :)), you can
try alternative algorithms, such as Rik van Riel's one. (go to
http://www.surriel.com/patches/
 and search for "oom")
