AFAICT Alan Cox  et al are saying that low-latency
gives better latency than -preempt, but that if lock-break
is added to -preempt, the results are basically the same.
IOW lock-break + preempt =~ low-latency as far as the
latency question is concerned.

Admittedly my observations have been more from
an "end-user" point of view, because at the end
of the day, what I experience while using Linux as
a multimedia/gaming platform is worth more than a
barrel of benchmarks - and while kernel compilation
time is of interest, it is just _one_  benchmark in the
greater scheme of things. (not to mention that that
benchmark result could probably be matched in a
non -preempt kernel via /proc tuning)
