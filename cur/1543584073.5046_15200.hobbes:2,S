The problem with these things it that sometimes such a task may
hold a lock, which can prevent higher-priority tasks from running.
A solution would be to make sure that these tasks get at least one
time slice every 3 seconds or so, so they can release any locks
they might be holding and the system as a whole won't livelock.
