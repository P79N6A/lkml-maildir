not every driver provides that file (btw, I guess you mean
/sys/module, don't you?) there anyway so it's still inconsistent.
what if you can see up until loading of the driver and it halts there
without /sys being mounted yet. I don't think you can rely on sysfs
being mounted or modules being loaded.
if I may vote as a CCISS user I say print the version number even if
no device is present.
