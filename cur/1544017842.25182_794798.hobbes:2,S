In my understanding, "sending signal" requires some protocol/order in userland.
Assume that users has to send signal in following order
  Application A -> Application B -> Application C.....
and may have problems sending signals in following order
  Application B -> Application A ->.....
So, signal and noop(just classify apps) is not equivalent in this semantics.

multilply-mounted means its own hierachy can be created per mount point ?
If so, signal subsystem can be used instead of noop.
