I think the latest drm tree (which might be part of -rc1, I haven't checked 
the changelogs) includes support for several PCIe radeons. Your best bet 
would probably be to compile in DRM (kernel side), check dmesg that it's 
detected your card, then download the latest snapshot of X11R6 6.9/7.0 and 
build it.
The alternative is ATI's proprietary driver which probably already supports 
your card.
