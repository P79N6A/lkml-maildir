Dear community member:
I am a student in Sociology of Organizations at the Paris 5 University in 
France, studying the new model of organization created by the Internet, for 
which the OpenSource is a prototype.
If you are a Linux/OpenSource developer, I will be grateful if you can 
spare a few minutes to fill in my questionnaire at the following address:
http://isa.lin.free.fr/questionnaire
Some additional information is available there.
Many thanks in advance for your help.
