While working on a race-free rewrite of cp/mv/rm (suggested by Al), I 
did overall-time benchmarks on read+write versus sendfile/stat versus 
mmap/stat, and found that pretty much the fastest way under Linux 2.2, 
2.4, and solaris was read+write of PAGE_SIZE, or PAGE_SIZE*2 chunks. 
[obviously, 2.2 and solaris didn't do sendfile test]
The overhead of the extra stat and mmap/munmap syscalls seemed to be the 
thing that slowed things down.  sendfile was pretty fast, but still an 
extra syscall, with an annoyingly large error handling case [only 
certain files can be sendfile'd]
I sure would like an O_STREAMING flag, though...  let a user app hint to 
the system that the pages it is reading or writing are perhaps less 
likely to be reused, or access randomly....  A copy-file syscall would 
be nice, too, but that's just laziness talking....
