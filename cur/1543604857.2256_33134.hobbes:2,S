If you have any of CONFIG_SMP, CONFIG_X86_UP_APIC, or CONFIG_X86_UP_IOAPIC
enabled, then it's a known problem: broken Dell BIOS. Just make sure
all three of these config options are off/disabled.
I'm (slowly) working on a solution. It involves moving dmi_scan to a
much earlier point in the init sequence (to setup_arch), but there
are some issues regarding its use of ioremap/iounmap to resolve first.
