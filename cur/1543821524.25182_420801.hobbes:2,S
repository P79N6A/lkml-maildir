In case someone is interested, the freebsd people is trying to design
something that tries to achieve such things for the particular case
of the kernel without falling in the dangers of c++ 
"...a dialect of the C language that simplifies the task of writing kernel
code. It should include language extensions that make it possible to write
kernel code more cleanly and with less bugs. An example of this would have
language support for linked lists, to obviate the need for messy MACROs"
