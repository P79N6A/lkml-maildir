Put_user uses `current`, i.e., the current processs to access the
current processes data. An interrupt will occur at any time, not
just during your task's time-slice, therefore `current` will not
mean anything usefull. When your user buffer is allocated, you
need to convert its address to a physical page, make sure the
page can't be paged out, and access that physical page from your
ISR.
