A better approach would be to remove the need for compile.h from
configs.c. See attached patch for the makefile change.
It just took the relevant part from mk_compile and
used it in the Makefile.
Example only - I expect Randy to integrate it properly.
But what you see is also a more fundamental problem.
Should we allow the kernel to be build by two distinct users - 
in this case a normal user and root.
We could check for this early, and stop. But it would require
too many changes in the top-level Makefile for my taste.
