Yeah, that recommendation always bugged me too.  I would never do that; if
you really want to enforce something like that, the proper place is in a
pre-checkin transform in your source management system so that everything
that actually hits the source management database has no tabs in it.  Not
in individual editors.
But the rest of the message is a good summary of the issues, as far as I'm
concerned.
I'll add one additional issue, and the one that bugs me the most in
practice about tabs.  Tabs make patches a pain in the neck to read,
because they change the indentation of the lines in a diff so that it no
longer matches the original indentation.  In particularly pathological
cases, they can even make an indented line even with an unintended line.
