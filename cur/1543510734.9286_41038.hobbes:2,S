Cygnus requires all sorts of other things before accepting patches
anyway, including that you sign the copyright handover to the FSF.
The number of people hacking compilers is significantly smaller than
the number of people hacking the Linux kernel as far as I can
tell. And to be frank, if I was to submit a doc update for every
single patch I submitted I would reconsider whether it was worth the
effort to submit in the first place.
So the comment still stands.
