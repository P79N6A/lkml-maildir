  I remember that there is a  Gimp-plugin in the plugin registry that save an
image in the bootlogo.h format. I can't remember its name though.
Here are some specs of the logo:
  It should be 80x80 pix, with less than 224 colors...
  The logo itself it composed of four array of unsigned char
  The first three are color lookup tables for the red, green, and blue.
 - linux_logo_red[] contains the quantity of red for each color index of the
                    logo.
 - same for green and blue.
 - linux_logo[] contains 3*80*80 bytes. Each triplet of bytes represent a
                pixel. These bytes are indexes in the red, green and blue
                tables to use with the previous tables.
  You'll find attached a package with some logos and a tools to show them
  on the screen (you'll need gtk to compile it). By looking in it, you should
  be able to write your own loading/saving routines.
        Regards,

The day-to-day travails of the IBM programmer are so amusing to most of

Charlie Chaplin trying to cook a shoe.
