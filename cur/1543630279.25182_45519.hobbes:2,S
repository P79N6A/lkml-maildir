Firstly, I haven't subscribed to this list since 2.3 so please also copy 
me on repsonses.
Secondly, I am e-mailing from my Mother's place as it IS Mother's Day 
AND my home PC will no longer boot Linux (my primary OS), so please send 
responses to johnnyo@mindspring.com
TIA :-)
Now the problem.
I use reiserfs on all my filesystems.  I have noticed some minor 
corruption of files in the past when I didnt shut down Linux properly 
(lockups, etc).  I experiment alot with my computer.
Anyway lately I was havin a problem that required frequent reboots.  Now 
I believe my root filesystem is corrupted?!?  Linux 2.4.18 boots till it 
gets to
reiserfs: checking transaction log (device 08:12)
attempt to access beyond end of device
08:12: rw=0 want=268574776 limit=8747392
vs-13070: reiserfs_read_inode2: i/o failure occurred trying to find stat 
data of [1 2 0x0 SD]
Using r5 hash to sort names
Reiserfs version 3.6.25
VFS: Mounted root (reiserfs filesystem) readonly.
Warning: unable to mount devfs, err: -5
Freeing unused kernel memory: 224k freed
Warning: unable to open an initial console.
Kernel panic: No init found.
If someone can get me to the point where I can just get to read my 
filesystem read-only, so I get get all my data off of it, I would be 
EXTREMELY GRATEFUL!  I have some very important data on that FS.  I went 
to the reiserfs web site to discover I'd get charged $25 for asking for 
help, so unless someone convinces me otherwise, I will be converting to 
EXT3 when this disaster is over...
Slackware Linux 8.1b2
Linux 2.4.18
ReiserFS 3.6.25
GLIBC 2.2.5
GCC 2.95.3
Any help please?!?
