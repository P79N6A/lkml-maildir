Not necessarily. I think that as long as the small filesystem is not
being used, then we _should_ be reclaiming slowly from it,
regardless of how big the other filesystems are.  That's the way the
global list ends up working now as the dentries for the small
filesystem get purged according to LRU.

Or alternatively small filesystems with no activity and dentries
that will never get used again never get trimmed while the large
fielsytem with lots of activity gets trimmed. This can lead to
thousands of pages being pinned in slabs that we don't try to
free up until we've already free >90% of the overall caches.
That's not very appealing, IMO.
So I suggest the question is this - how do you define "not being
used"? I guess dentry age or "last dentry was added to list at time
X" (recorded in dput()) would be one way of determining this.
Say something like:
dput():
	list_add(&dentry->d_lru, &dentry->d_sb->s_unused);
	dentry->s_sb->s_unused_age = jiffies +
				(&dentry->d_sb->s_dentry_stat.age_limit * HZ);
prune_dcache():
	tmp = sb->s_dentry_stat.nr_unused/((unused/count)+1);
	if ((tmp == 0) && time_after(jiffies, sb->s_unused_age))
		tmp = 1;
That would turn over small unused dentry lists that have not been
modified for age_limit seconds. That means that small caches that
are being used are not reclaimed prematurely, and those small
caches would also be reclaimed after some time if they are not
being used. That seems to address both our concerns.....
Thoughts?
Cheers,
Dave.
