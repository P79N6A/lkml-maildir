Indeed, and I'm sorry if we seem to be confusing two separate issues.
There are two different ways forward here.
The quick and easy hack to get raw IO working is to do precisely what
the swap code does.  That works fully synchronously, so it's easy to do.

Yes: the raw IO quick fix is just like swap.  The harder problem is to
hide it inside ll_rw_block(), which we _do_ want to do if we move the
page cache to high memory.  Only with ll_rw_block doing the hard work
can we do asynchronous kmap fixup, which we need for things like
readahead.  Swap and raw IO are synchronous for now.
