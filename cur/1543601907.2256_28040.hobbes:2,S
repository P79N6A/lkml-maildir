Strange - mine works. Either with APM and 'apm=power-off' on the command 
line, or with ACPI and a hack to work around the incompetence of Abit's 
BIOS engineers.
Me: "There's a one-char typo in your ACPI bytecode which prevents it from 
	working. This is the fix...."
Abit: "You can work around that by turning off ACPI support in the BIOS 
	setup"
Me: "But that just disables it, and makes it continue to not work. To make
	it work, it needs to be enabled - but there's a simple typo which
	prevents it from working."
Abit: <silence>
Sometimes it amazes me just how stupid some people can be and still 
actually keep their job.
