Subject: Seagate ST340824A and (un)clipping max LBA: 2.2.19+ide04092001 patch

Disk capacity unclipping routines in ide.2.2.19.04092001.patch do not unclip
Seagate ST340824A.
I have to use the jumper on the drive to make system boot.
I tried "setmax" program and it is able to unclip the capacity,
kernel however does not.
I digged a little and I think the problem is that ST340824A does not follow
the ATA standard - it does support both READ NATIVE MAX ADDRESS
and SET MAX ADDRESS, but does not advertise support for
Host Protected Area feature set.
drive->id->command_set_1 = 0x306b for the this drive.
The unclipping routines compare
drive->id->command_set_1 and 0x0400 (Host Protected Feature set)
The earlier version of the patch compared
drive->id->command_set_1 and 0x000a (Security Mode & Power Managment ???)
When I changed it back to 0x000a, it unclipped the capacity just fine.
But 0x000a doesn't make any sense to me.
What is the correct solution?
Also the idedisk_supports_host_protected_area is there, but not used and
the printk's notifying of unclipping are commented out???
I attach the diff to show what I'm talking about.
Also a related question: when I use "setmax", the drive reports full
capacity through "hdparm -I /dev/hd*", but kernel still uses the old info.
How does one update the kernel info after using "setmax"?
