Luckily the filesystem had no important data on it yet, so I have been 
testing various changes.
First I changed the mount from ext3 to plain ext2, and that eventually 
produced a series of errors like this:
May 24 03:15:18 localhost kernel: init_special_inode: bogus i_mode (2640)
May 24 03:15:29 localhost kernel: init_special_inode: bogus i_mode (175015)

Then I tried changing from dm-crypt to dm-linear and have not been able to 
reproduce the problem using dm-linear.  Unfortunately, the test conditions 
are not exactly the same because using the dm-crypt module completely pegs 
the cpu, while using the linear module is disk-bound not io-bound and the 
cpu utilization is MUCH lower.
However, this leads me to suspect that the problem is either in dm-crypt, or 
a data corruption problem resulting from a decrypt error from the aes_x86_64 
module that dm-crypt is using.
One thing I forgot to mention before is this is on a dual-core box.  Just in 
case the problem may be related to SMP, I'm planning to try recompiling for 
a non-SMP kernel and go back to using dm-crypt and see if I can still 
produce the error that way.
If anyone has variations that would be more useful, I can try to test those 
first.
