Hi,
I've ran into the lockdep problem: I'm hitting the condition at the
lockdep.c:2437:
       if (DEBUG_LOCKS_WARN_ON(id >= MAX_LOCKDEP_KEYS))
                return 0;
What does it mean and how to overcome it? Dumbly increasing constants
at kernel/lockdep_internals.h didn't help.
The warning is pretty fatal for me because it happens when I'm locking
clocks lock, so when serial console output calls
clk_enable/clk_disable the kernel deadlocks.
