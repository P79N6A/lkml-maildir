If you took a look at patch, you'd realize that this is already
done. 2 lines of c ;-).

PS: Patch actually does not change semantics of almost anything:
Setuid root can do _anything_...
...which for example means it can volunteerily give up its
rights. What capelf does is that instead of dropping it at beggining
of main (which is doable _right now_), it drops them even sooner _AND_
external program like lscap can verify that it is really going to drop
privileges.
