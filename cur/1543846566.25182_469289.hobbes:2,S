Hi Andrew,
Right now I don't have access to my test machine.  Tomorrow morning,
very first thing I am going to try it out with your config file.
This patch just adds and ELF header to bzImage which is not even used
by grub.
So without this patch you are able to boot the kernel on your laptop?
Thanks
Vivek
