Trond, wake up!  __emul_lookup_dentry() does nothing of the sort.
Neither does anything else.  In theory it could, but that's not a
reason to do a confusing thing like that.

Based on flags.  It's just a FMODE_* -> MAY_* transformation

I think the _only_ caller of open_namei() is filp_open(), so this is
not much of an issue, but yeah, you could do it that way too.
Or you could initialize nameidata from filp_open().
