Subject: [PATCH revised] firewire: sbp2: add workarounds for 2nd and 3rd generation iPods
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2009/1/28/455

According to 
https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/294391
  - 3rd generation iPods need the "fix capacity" workaround after all
    (apparently they crash after the last sector was accessed),
  - 2nd generation iPods need the "128 kB maximum request size"
    workaround.
Alas both iPod generations feature the same model ID in the config ROM,
hence we can only define a shared quirks list entry for them.  Luckily
the fix capacity workaround did not show a negative effect in Jarod's
tests with 2nd gen. iPod.
A side note:  Apple computers in target mode (or at least an x86 Mac
mini) don't have firmware_version and model_id, hence none of the iPod
quirks list entries is active for them.
