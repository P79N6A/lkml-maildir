Sure, thanks for reminding.
Islam, if you'd like to write an userspace 'driver' (really trivial 
few-liner) for the missing keys, you can use a new functionality in recent 
kernels, which allows you to use EVIOCSKEYCODE ioctl() on evdev to create 
a proper mapping between the usage codes that are not handled by 
hid-input, and keycodes.
