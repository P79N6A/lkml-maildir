Additional information:
I found another setup which has the same problem reproducable. Since this is no
production unit I can test patches. It may be important to the problem that
there are _three_ network cards, as the test-setup shows no degression in
simple 1-1 through routing but using a third network card ot the same box makes
it woe.
Hope this helps.
