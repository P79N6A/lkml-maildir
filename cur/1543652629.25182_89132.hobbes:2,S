The Client is the guy that just retries, as you say from a time-out.
This shouldn't affect any internal TCP/IP code. The time-out is
at the application (client) level. It sent a request, the data
was sent or promised to be sent because the write() or send() didn't
block, now it expects to get the data it asked for. It waits, nothing
happens. It times-out and sends the exact same request again.
Cheers,
