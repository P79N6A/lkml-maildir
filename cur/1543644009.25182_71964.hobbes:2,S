Hmm, looking at the tty stuff, I'd say its a distinct possibility.  Even
more so since the flip buffer handler is put on tq_timer, which is subject
to ksoftirqd.
However, at the point when we hand data to the tty layer, we should have
2048 bytes left in the flip buffer before we really start soft overrunning
(vs hardware overrunning.)  I notice that we don't make any attempt to
report such an event to user space, even when user space wants to know
about overruns.
Christian - what baud rate are you running these uarts at?
