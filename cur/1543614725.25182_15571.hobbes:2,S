Hi, I was one that reported the problem that zImage doesn't work. I don't
personally care whether it works or not because bzImages are fine for my
machines. Anyway, 2.2.20pre3 was ok but 2.2.20pre5 was not. I just rechecked
with 2.2.20 final. I compiled 2.2.20 'make zImage; make bzImage' for one old
486 and for one pentium. Both print Out of memory and System halted for the
zImages and work fine with bzImages.
486:

I compiled them with gcc version egcs-2.91.66 19990314/Linux (egcs-1.1.2
release) and binutils 2.11.90.0.19 (tehy are the versions that come with
Slackware 8.0). The pentium uses LILO version 19 and the 486 uses version
21.7-5.
If you think those are too large kernels for zImage, e.g. this 2.2.19 works
ok on the 486:
