i'm wondering how much difference it makes on ARM - could you show us 
the before and after disassembly of the fastpath, to see the 
improvement?
your patches look OK to me, only one small detail sticks out: i'd 
suggest to rename the atomic_*_contended macros to be arch_mutex_*_..., 
i dont think any other code can make use of it. Also, it would be nice 
to see the actual ARM patches as well, which make use of the new 
infrastructure.
could you resend them against my latest queue that i just posted? I'll 
look at integrating them tomorrow.
