(if not already answered)
short answer:  see include/asm-generic/div64.h
longer answer:
Not supported:
long long numerator, divisor, dividend;
/* init. numerator & divisor */
dividend = numerator / divisor;
Is supported:
uin64_t numerator, dividend;
uint32_t divisor, remainder;
/* init. numerator & divisor */
remainder = do_div(&numerator, divisor);
