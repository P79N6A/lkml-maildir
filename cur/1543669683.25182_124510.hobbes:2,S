I'm looking at making device probing a zillion different threads from
within the kernel, allowing us to probe devices much faster than we do
today (and fixes a lot of nasty problems with broken hardware that we
currently have today).  That would ensure that those events would never
be in a reliable and repeatable order :)

Exactly, let's not do that.  The current scheme does not do that.  Out
of order is solvable, while missing events is not simple.
