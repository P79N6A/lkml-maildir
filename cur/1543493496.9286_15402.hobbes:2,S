Trying to build and install Kernel 2.2.5 or 2.2.6.
When I build it, i use bzImage, and the LILO says the kernel is too large.
There is no size difference with zImage, or bzImage. I modularized enough code
to make zImage accept it, but LILO still complains.
I am using RedHat 5.2 w/ kernel 2.0.36. I have installed the utilities RPM s
for 2.2 kernel.
BTW, I'm not on the list.
