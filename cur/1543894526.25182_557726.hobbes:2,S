I have the same problem with this drive (shipped with a Thinkpad Z61m):
        Model Number:       HITACHI HTS541612J9SA00
        Firmware Revision:  SBDIC7JP
It reported several dozen spurious completions over a few days, but I can't 
find any corruption. Is it really dangerous? I understand this clearly is a 
firmware bug, but I'm not sure how to interpret the drive behavior.
I can perform any test you like, if you find it useful.
