My setup looks like this, I boot from hde
I configured my BIOS to boot from SCSI (I have no scsi-adapter but the
promise card reports itself as one at boottime)
boot = /dev/hde3
delay = 50
message = /boot/message
vga = extended
read-only
lba32
disk=/dev/hde
  bios=0x80
image=/boot/kernel/vmlinuz-2.4.1-pre2
  label = Linux
  root = /dev/hde5
image=/boot/kernel/vmlinuz-2.4.0-test10
  label = test10
  root = /dev/hde5
This works perfectly fine here
