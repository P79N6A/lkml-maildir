Hey Jesper,
                Rather,  it can be done as below. Nothing to say that 
your code wouldn't work. Just that catch it early, so that potential 
function call overhead to call xfs_free_buftarg can be avoided.
void
xfs_unmountfs_close(xfs_mount_t *mp, struct cred *cr)
{
       if (mp->m_logdev_targp && (mp->m_logdev_targp != mp->m_ddev_targp))
                xfs_free_buftarg(mp->m_logdev_targp, 1);
        if (mp->m_rtdev_targp)
                xfs_free_buftarg(mp->m_rtdev_targp, 1);
        xfs_free_buftarg(mp->m_ddev_targp, 0);
}
