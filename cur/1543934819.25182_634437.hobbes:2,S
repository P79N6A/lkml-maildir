Don't know how you got to 136, the minimum alignment is 4 on x86. But I
already said in my last email that SLUB would win for the special case
of power of two allocations. But as long as we're looking at worst
cases, let's consider an alloc of 257 bytes..
SLUB  8 (1016 bytes wasted)
SLOB 15 (105 bytes wasted, with 136 bytes still usable)
Can we be done with this now, please?
