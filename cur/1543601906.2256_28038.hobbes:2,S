The list is an okay way to determine rank within a class, but I still
think that there is a need for some balance between text, program data,
pages loaded via i/o, perhaps more. My disquiet with the new
implementation is based on a desire to avoid swapping program data to make
room for i/o data (using those terms in a loose way for identification).
I would also like to have time to investigate what happens if the pages
associated with a program load are handled in larger blocks, meta-pages
perhaps, which would at least cause many to be loaded at once on a page
fault, rather than faulting them in one at a time. I have to look at the
code again in my spare time, my last serious visit was 2.2.15 or so,
looking to improve SMP performance.
