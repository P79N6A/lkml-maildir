Have you booted an MVME5100 after these changes as well?  The
mvme5100_openpic_initsenses table looks like it needs to be updated
still.  For a guide to how it should all look, if you've got the hw and
time, please look how the PowerPlus code was updated recently (in BK,
the key is trini@kernel.crashing.org|ChangeSet|20040311200618|42037,
currently changeset 1.1557.88.1).
