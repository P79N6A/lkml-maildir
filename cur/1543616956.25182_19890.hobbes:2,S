Not applicable.  There are no endian-specific binary structure in the 
format AT ALL.  ASCII-coded fields are always bigendian.

They're ASCII-coded, so it supposedly doesn't matter (yet, it's a bit 
daft, but blame the SysV people.)  The alignment makes sure the *data* 
field is 4-byte aligned.

It's pretty clear from a lot of the comments that a number of people 
haven't understood that the cpio encapsulation *THIS IS A CODIFICATION 
OF AN EXISTING FORMAT.*
