This doesn't get initialised anywhere.
Presumably you're relying on a memset somewhere.  That might work on all
architectures, AFAIK.  But in theory it's wrong.  If, for example, the
architecture implements atomic_t via a spinlock-plus-integer, and that
spinlock's unlocked state is not all-bits-zero, we're dead.
So we should initialise it with
	foo->num_waiting = ATOMIC_INIT(0);
nb: it is not correct to initialise an atomic_t with
	atomic_set(a, 0);
because in the above theoretical case case where the arch uses a spinlock
in the atomic_t, that spinlock doesn't get initialised.  I bet we've got code
in there which does this.
