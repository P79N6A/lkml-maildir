Hello world,
I've not been getting any mail from linux-kernel for the better part of
the last week. As far as I can tell, I'm still subscribed. I've tried
unsubscribing and resubscribing with the same address, with no luck.
I have a friend who's been in a similar situation, which was improved by
unsubscribing from his .au address and resubscribing from a .com address.
Although he was still concerned that the volume was much lower than
normal.
In any case, there's something very weird happening with the lists.
Please cc: replies, for the obvious reason.

I don't speak for anyone save myself. PGP encrypted mail preferred.
