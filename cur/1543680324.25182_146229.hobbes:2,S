It looks like it was intended to call an old version of the suspend
code on ARM devices - probably the power button on the iPAQ.
The correct function (in the ARM tree) is now called "suspend()" and
deals with suspending the devices and then whatever is needed to cause
the CPU to go into deep sleep - ie, the user visible "power off" state.
Absolutely nothing to do with swsusp I'm afraid. 8)
