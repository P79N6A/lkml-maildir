Yes, it's clear to me that these problems won't occur in CML2 but it's
unlikely that CML2 will make it into the 2.4 kernels, so we need
workarounds that work in most cases.
The workaround you invented doesn't work in the case when
CONFIG_INPUT_GAMEPORT is compiled modular.
My patch handles these cases, too. If you do the wrong things in the wrong
order (not that extremely likely) the things that are displayed aren't
100% correct, but at least you do always have a valid configuration in the
end.
IMHO your solution is nearer on how it should be implemented in CML2 and
my solution is a better workaround for the limited CML1.
