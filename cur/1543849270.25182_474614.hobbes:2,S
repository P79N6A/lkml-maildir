Hi Thomas, Ingo
In the following 3 email I am sending 3 patches, which remove code, that 
becomes unused with the rt-patch.
Compile-tested for ARM (which has undergone most changes) (mainstone and 
assabet configs) and i386 (defconfig and allmodconfig). Don't 
have a possibility to compile it for other platforms (at least here at 
work).
Thanks
Guennadi
