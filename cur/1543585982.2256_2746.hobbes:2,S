Relatively small quibble - Current large clusters (SP3, 330 node 4cpu/node)
gets around 85% to 90% (real user) user mode total cpu. The rest is user
mode is attributed to overhead. Why:
    1. Inter-node communication/synchronization
    2. Memory bus saturation
    3. Users usually use only 3 cpus/node and allow the last cpu to handle
       filesystem/network/administration/batch handling functions. Using the
       last cpu in the node for part of the job reduces the overall throughput
