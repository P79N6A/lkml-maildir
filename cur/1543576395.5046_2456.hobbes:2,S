If this were to be adopted:
  
ftp://autogen.linuxave.net/pub/PCIDEV.tgz
I would finish it so that there would be one and only one place to
update for any and all PCI devices for 2.2, 2.4 and any other
kernel.  However, it would take several days and I won't do it
unless there were some reasonable chance for adoption.  The
referenced implementation only covers the 2.4 kernel:
1.  the list of PCI manufacturers and devices
2.  the IDE controllers
still to do would be the dispatch tables for other kinds of
devices, the tables for the 2.2 kernel and the device information
for the non-IDE dispatch tables.  (The latter being the hard
[time consuming] part.  Creating the tables from the data is
easy.)
Once this is all done, both the 2.2 and 2.4 (and future) kernels
would be kept up to date by updating a single database and regenerating
the tables.
