	The only way to avoid all of this - totaly rewrite function 
inverse_translate() to make possible translation not from font position
but from Unicode. And add to console driver one another screen buffer
in which will be stored unicode symbols. In this case selection must
work from this buffer and not from screen buffer. But I'm afraid that
now it's not possible while kernel 2.3 not started.
