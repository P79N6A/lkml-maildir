I am pretty new to this kernel hacking so I may need a few pointers.
Do you mean Alan Cox's patches at
ftp://ftp.linux.org.uk/pub/linux/alan/2.2pre/
 ?
If so then can I just apply the latest 2 patch-2.2.0pre6ac1.bz2 &
patch-2.2.0pre6ac2.bz2 ?
or do I have to get them all and build the whole thing from scartch ?
Will the ac patches be in the next pre7 release ?
