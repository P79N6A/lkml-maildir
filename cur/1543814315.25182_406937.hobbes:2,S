No.
Take a big file (5-10gb)
$ cp bigfile newfile
$ cp bigfile newfile2
$ cp bigfile newfile3
$ cp bigfile newfile4
$ md5sum bigfile newfile*
[results are all different, assuming kernel doesn't panic during test]
When I use the "stress" utility from
http://weather.ou.edu/~apw/projects/stress/
The box usually makes it an an hour or two before a kernel panic or I/O
errors wedge the box.
I setup a netdump/netconsole server on my network and I have several
crashes captured. If you are interested I can send them on to you. I
filed most them under the Red Hat bugzilla, but closed them after I
discovered they were a hardware problem.

Linux device mapper is proprietary? :)
The corruption occurs with a single disk or when using a device mapper
"nvraid".

No. Detection was never a problem for me.

I'm not, see above.

Well, what can Linux do about this hardware problem? Maybe there is a
workaround that can be done, but I'm not counting on it. A warning would
be nice if it possible to detect the conditions where this can occur.
This way others can troubleshoot and identify this problem quicker.
I used mostly late model FC5 rawhide kernels which I believe are based
off of 2.6.16rc5-git12/git13 or therebouts.

Sorry for the misunderstanding. Again, no proprietary drivers ever
loaded. Problem is 100% reproducible. See above, etc.
