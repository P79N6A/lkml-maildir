By uploading new firmware you can make the drive return compromised pages
from swap which make an existing RAWIO application do what you want
- so CAP_DEVICE_CMD in the IDE case at least is CAP_SYS_RAWIO

That assumes a totally generic interface is good - ATA is rather different
to ATAPI/SCSI so it may be best the device interface reflects that.
