It has already hit slashdot and all the usual Linux "3l33t" losers are
coming out of the woodwork whinging at Ken Thompson. I fully accept I was
wrong to malign Ken Thompson in the first place though, I've been reading
up on his background recently. However, I still think his comment
comparing Linux to NT is just not quite cricket, old boy.
Cheers,
