process timer (by setitimer) isn't good. Is per-cpu itimer to improve it?
Prior to kernel 2.6.28, process timer implementation is poor. When the process timer
is near to expire, threads will sum the time from all threads of the thread group
over and over again. If there are thousands of threads, kernel might hang eventually.
I ran into it a couple of months ago when I tried to enable specweb2005 (Apache+PHP
thread mode).
So the per-cpu itimer could improve this situation when thread number is far bigger than
cpu number. I didn't retry specweb2005 with 2.6.28.
