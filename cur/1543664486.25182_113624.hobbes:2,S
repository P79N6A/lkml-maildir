It might not have anything to do with your problem, but it has
been reported several times that Promise chips don't support ATAPI
optical devices (i.e. your CD-ROM) without special driver support,
which the Linux drivers apparently don't have.
Maybe that's changed in 2.4.21-pre-ac new IDE code, I don't know.
Your cards don't share interrupts with anything else I hope?
