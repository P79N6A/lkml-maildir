I'd recommend attacking this one flag at a time - so for instance,
do up a series of patches that cleans up the -Wno-unused warnings, and
get that merged.  Then get a series for -Wno-sign-compare, and finally
a patch that adds -W.
While you're at it, look at these flags as well:
-Werror-implicit-function-declaration -Wcomment -Wendif-labels -Wshadow
(The tree is pretty clean for the first 3, cleaning it for the last will
take some work...)
