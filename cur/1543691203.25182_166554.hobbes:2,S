Subject: 2.6: ISDN_DIVAS link error: multiple "errno"
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I got the following link error in 2.6.0-test5-mm2 (it desn't seem to be
specific to -mm) with CONFIG_ISDN_DIVAS=y :
<--  snip  -->
...
  LD      .tmp_vmlinux1
drivers/built-in.o(.bss+0x123d60): multiple definition of `errno'
lib/lib.a(errno.o)(.bss+0x0): first defined here
<--  snip  -->
drivers/isdn/hardware/eicon/divasmain.c has a non-static variable errno
(on a first sight it doesn't seem to be really used) that conflicts
with the variable in lib/errno.c .
