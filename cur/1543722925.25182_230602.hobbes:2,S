Yep.  I just wonder if logging only the current command will be enough.  
Sometimes it's important to see what other, successful commands preceded 
the one that didn't work.  Well, we can always fall back on the old 
verbose debugging.

An error is any time the transport routine returns TRANSPORT_ERROR or the 
command is aborted by the SCSI layer.  We should also log SCSI-initiated 
resets, but not the auto-resets for the Bulk-only protocol.
