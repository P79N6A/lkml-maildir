Sure.  It appears to cause an immediate "sync" of the file data
to disk (lots of drive activity for a few seconds), and the Dirty
count from /proc/meminfo reduces correspondingly.
Oddly enough, the Dirty count didn't go all the way down, though.
Doing a "sync" or a second run of the program afterwards does
get the count down to zero immediately, without any significant I/O.
Strange.
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
int main (int argc, char *argv[])
{
         while (--argc > 0) {
                 int fd = open(*++argv, O_RDWR);
                 if (fd == -1) {
                         perror(*argv);
                 } else {
                         int posix_fadvise(int, off_t, off_t, int);
                         const int POSIX_FADV_DONTNEED = 4;
                         int rc = posix_fadvise(fd, 0, 0, POSIX_FADV_DONTNEED);
                         if (rc == -1)
                                 perror(*argv);
                         close(fd);
                 }
         }
         return 0;
}
