On this test machine, I had to add the lapic command line, but that was
there when I first had to get NMI working on this machine back in the V0.7
days :-)

Could this cause a 2 second drop backwards?

Well, this machine is a normal PC not a laptop, and anyway, this backwards
clock happened during a stress test with pretty much 100% CPU usage, so I
think we can rule out power saving.

Can this be a 2 second warp?

My older code first used jiffies as a timer, then I switched to TSC and
then to APIC timer, and then finally ktimer.  ktimer was the first to show
a backwards get_time.
