e2fsck 1.32 seems to work fine here.
Try arranging for a partition to _not_ be mounted at boot (disable it in
/etc/fstab).  Then do a `reboot -f' and when you get a login prompt, run
e2fsck against that partition.
If the journal recovery is still slow then try capturing the state when it is
stuck with sysrq-T.
