Ok, then, tell me.  I give you a hard drive (say /dev/hda), and
partition entry (say, 3rd entry in the extended partition which is the
4th entry of the mbr).  How do I know, in a reliable way (as in, it
won't change in the next kernel versions), which device to open to
write in the boot sector of this partition?
  OG.
