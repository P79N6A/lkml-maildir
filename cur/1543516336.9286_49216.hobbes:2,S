On my old 486 I see a fair number (hundreds/hour) of "prune called" events in
/proc/net/netstat. At least 95%, and I think 100%, occur in the loopback
device. On a couple of occasions, I've seen a couple of thousand "out of order
prune" events occur in a few seconds. There seems to be no correlation with
the presence or absence of any other network device.
Is this expected behavior or is something wrong?
Thanks.
