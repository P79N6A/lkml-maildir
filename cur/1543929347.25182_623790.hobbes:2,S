I don't mind if the ABI changes, so long as I can still use something 
similar.
The namespace logic is interesting to me in general, but at this point I 
can't think of a way that
it actually helps this particular module.  All I really need is a way to 
grab every frame
from eth0 and then transmit it to eth1.  I'm currently doing this by 
finding the netdevice
and registering a raw-packet protocol (ie, like tcpdump would do).  At 
least up to 2.6.23,
this does not require any hacks to the kernel and uses only non GPL 
exported symbols.
Based on my understanding of the namespace logic, if I never add any 
namespaces,
the general network layout should look similar to how it does today, so 
I should have
no logical problem with my module.

Does this imply that every module that accesses the network code *must* 
become
GPL simply because it must interact with namespace logic that is 
exported as GPL only symbols?
Thanks,
Ben
