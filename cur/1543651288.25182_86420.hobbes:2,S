This makes me uneasy, do you mean you want to:
i) make a 'loop' target, if so why ?
ii) or that you want to rewrite loop so that it sits on top of dm -
    ie. you create a set of linear mappings that correspond to the
    file ?   This would only be sensible if there is significant
    simplification/reduction of the loop code, and probably would
    never work because of tail packing.
I'm not keen on either of these ideas.
