If I had had time to spare, I'd have taken you up on the offer.
Some of those will be ones I've spent hours thinking about without
success, some just gone away, some found guilty by memtest86, some
I probably have overlooked.

Wow.  Just two days ago, in unrelated mail, I asked
"Has anyone _ever_ seen a p??_ERROR message?" and you now show us one!
Thank you - but you do seem to have quite bad memory corruption.

Again you have a page mapping which should be NULL here anyway,
and doesn't even look like a pointer which is what goes in there
at other times.
I understand that you have a sentimental attachment to your setup.
And the corruption you're seeing could as well be from software as
hardware - but I don't think anyone else is seeing it on this scale,
which does point to your particular hardware.
But I don't want to close down this thread: if someone else can
suggest something useful to try, please go ahead.
Hugh
