That's pretty bad corruption indeed.  What I'm puzzling over though
is why other 965G users aren't seeing the same thing.
My own 965G seems to be fine, though that's using Intel graphics
instead of nvidia.
(Just to rule it out, I'm assuming at this stage in boot that the
 nvidia driver module has never been loaded?)
And if you never load the agpgart modules, you never see lockups?
Right now, I'm at a loss to explain this.
