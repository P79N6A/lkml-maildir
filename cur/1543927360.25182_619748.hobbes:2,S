Being a very heavy stgit user myself, I have to say you must give up git
rebase on any stgit branch, and use stg rebase instead... otherwise, bad
things can, and do happen.
Also, don't trust the stgit release schedule, it is "release eventually" and
not something more sensible, like "release often".  Instead, track the stgit
git tree.
I wish git learned to do the basic stgit's business by itself :(
