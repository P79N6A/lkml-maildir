I'll do it at the beg. of next week, as I'm not going into the Lab
tomorrow.
I'm using 2 basically (as in have gotten serviced and parts replaced)
netfinity's.  1 seems to work perfectly well w/ the pcnet32 driver/card,
while the other one was having serious issue.  Strangely enough, I took
about a 10% hit in performance when I went from the "broken" pcnet32
card to the intel eepro 100 on my informal nfs benchmarks (at least for
the ones that would complete w/o hanging the computer)
