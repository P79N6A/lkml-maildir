So if a volunteer does bad work, I'm obligated to accept it just because
I haven't done better?
Alternately, if a volunteer does bad work, must it be merged into the
kernel because there's isn't a better implementation? (I believe that
was tried at least once with devfs.)
And how is the quality of the work to be judged if the work isn't
commented, documented and explained, especially the userland-visible
parts that *cannot* *ever* *be* *changed* *or* *removed* once they're in
a stable kernel release?
