More efforts, no real effects.
I don't think we need such an infrastructure.
The normal headers should just be usable for user-space inclusion.
However I realize that the difference isn't that important, as long
as we don't duplicate the definitions etc.

why not:
include/linux/wait.h:
#define WNOHANG         0x00000001
#define WUNTRACED       0x00000002
#ifdef __KERNEL__
#include <linux/config.h>
...
#endif /* __KERNEL__ */

Such as? In comparison to a (fixed) present situation?
