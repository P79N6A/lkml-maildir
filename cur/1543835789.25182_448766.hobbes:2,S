After the fixup code does this:
       movl %esp, %eax         # pt_regs pointer
       movl %esp, %edx
       call patch_espfix_gdt
       pushl $__ESPFIX_SS
       CFI_ADJUST_CFA_OFFSET 4
       pushl %eax
       CFI_ADJUST_CFA_OFFSET 4
==>    lss (%esp), %esp
       CFI_ADJUST_CFA_OFFSET -8
       jmp restore_nocheck
we are on a ring0 32-bit stack that's not zero-based.  If an exception
occurs in that state, UNWIND_ESPFIX_STACK restores the proper kernel
SS and ESP but on return from the exception nothing restores the espfix
stack.  I guess this isn't a problem now because exceptions in kernel
mode are fatal but a kernel debugger might have problems here?
