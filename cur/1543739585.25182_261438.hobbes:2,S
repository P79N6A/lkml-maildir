I'm implementing an "nice_scale" parameter in cpufreqd that offers more
control on nice cpu time. It's just a parameter (whose value must be >=
1 or if 0 don't care nice time at all) that tells _how_much_ the nice
time has to be take into consideration. It would be nice to have it in
the ondemand governor too.
