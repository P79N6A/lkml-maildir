Subject: Re: Who else with a PIIX is getting -- (Re: 2.3.41 / hda: lost interrupt)

I consistantly get the following:
hda: timeout waiting for DMA
hda: IRQ time: status 0xd0 { Busy }
hda: ide0: reset success
when using DMA.
1)  CONFIG_BLK_DEV_PIIX_TUNING is defined, which implies AUTO_DMA,
    or whatever it's called.
2)  The system is a dual P-III with a 440BX PII4 running in SMP mode.
3)  [root@thedog mike]# /sbin/hdparm -i /dev/hda
/dev/hda:
Model=ST39140A, FwRev=841260, SerialNo=AY073758
Config={ HardSect NotMFM HdSw>15uSec Fixed DTR>10Mbs }
RawCHS=16383/16/63, TrkSize=38430, SectSize=610, ECCbytes=4
BuffType=3(DualPortCache), BuffSize=448kB, MaxMultSect=16, MultSect=16
DblWordIO=no, maxPIO=2(fast), DMA=yes, maxDMA=2(fast)
CurCHS=16383/16/63, CurSects=-66060037, LBA=yes
LBA CHS=1023/256/63 Remapping, LBA=yes, LBAsects=17803440
tDMA={min:120,rec:120}, DMA modes: mword0 mword1 mword2
IORDY=yes, tPIO={min:120,w/IORDY:120}, PIO modes: mode3 mode4
UDMA modes: mode0 mode1 *mode2
4)  The system will often run for a bit with UDMA(33) turned on.
    For instance, when booted in single user mode, I was able to
    run a 'find' from '/'.  However, I can usually only get one to
    three hdparm -t (or dd if=/dev/hda... for 60 MB or so).  Then,
    I get:
hda: timeout waiting for DMA
hda: IRQ time: status 0xd0 { Busy }
hda: ide0: reset success
    If I'm booted in single user mode, the system recovers  fine.
    If not, it usually hangs in X.  All recent tests have been in
    single user mode.
5)  Releases: linux 2.2.14, with the ide patch for 2.2.14 installed.
Since I have an older SCSI driver, I could probably install a
system on it, and boot it.  Then, I could make the ide driver
modular, which might help speed up the debugging process.  Does
anyone have thoughts?
Also, if I get a chance tonight, I will make a non-SMP kernel and
see if that effects anything.
Mike
