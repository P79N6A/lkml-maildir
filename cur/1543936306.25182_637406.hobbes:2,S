Hm, no, the intrusion into the driver is just too much this late in the
release cycle to allow this.
Now I will be glad to only add the new device ids for the devices that
do not rely on the new changes right now, but that's it.
So, right now I have a separate patch split out of your original one
that is below.  Should I modify it and not include some of these device
ids right now?  You mention 0023, is that the only one I should remove
from this patch?
thanks,
