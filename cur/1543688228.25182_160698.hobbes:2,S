It's just my guess. You mean that "index cache" is on the pagecache?
"index cache" is allocated in the user space by malloc,
so I think it is not on the pagecache.

I checked /proc/meminfo.
For example, this is my /proc/meminfo(kernel 2.5.73)
MemTotal:       902728 kB
MemFree:         53096 kB
Buffers:         18520 kB
Cached:         732360 kB
SwapCached:          0 kB
Active:         623068 kB
Inactive:       179552 kB
HighTotal:           0 kB
HighFree:            0 kB
LowTotal:       902728 kB
LowFree:         53096 kB
SwapTotal:      506036 kB
SwapFree:       506036 kB
Dirty:           33204 kB
Writeback:           0 kB
Mapped:          73360 kB
Slab:            32468 kB
Committed_AS:   167396 kB
PageTables:        988 kB
VmallocTotal:   122808 kB
VmallocUsed:     20432 kB
VmallocChunk:   102376 kB
According to this information, I thought that
all pagecache was 732360 kB and all mapped page was 73360 kB, so
almost of pagecache was not mapped...
Do I misread meminfo?
