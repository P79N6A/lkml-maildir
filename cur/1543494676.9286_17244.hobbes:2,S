(Note I'm not subscribed to the list so please CC replies to me).
I am writing a network monitor, and was grepping the kernel source to have
a look at the support for promiscous network devices and noticed that the
old(2.0.*) PF_INET/SOCK_PACKET has been replaced with
PF_PACKET/(SOCK_PACKET, SOCK_DGRAM, SOCK_RAW).  I haven't been able to
find a functioning searchable index of linux-kernel so I'm asking
directly.
Is there any reason (other then athestics) for having SOCK_PACKET in its
own protocol family.
Is there a symmantic difference between SOCK_DGRAM and SOCK_RAW?
If libpcap was to be ported over to the new interface, how many programs
would still require SOCK_PACKET? (I'm perfectly happy to do the port, just
wondering if it's worth it).
Is there any documentation/discussions anywhere to help me understand the
interface better.  I've read the code, I think I understand it, but it
would be nice to find some confirmation (my code seems to work, but that
dosn't mean it's right).
Thanks in advance.
