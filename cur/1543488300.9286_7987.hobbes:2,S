Hi!
I am setting up a gateway with Linux 2.0.36. It contains two network
cards (eth0 and eth1).
The cards are both recognised by the kernel. eth1 is a wd8013.
My problem is: Network traffic over eth1 doesn't work.
When I ping to an IP-Adress which is routed over eth1 I get errors like
ping: sendto: Permission denied
What could be the reason for this behavior?
Could it be that the network card is defective or are there other
reasons which cause that problem? Why do I get "Permission denied"?
Greetings, Michael
