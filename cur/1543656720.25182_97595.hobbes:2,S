Yeah, it's not that bad, I'll look into it when I get to those files :)

Yes, I think this is still true.  And it's also a good way to enforce
the "one value per file" rule :)

I saw that logic.  I don't think sysfs can handle poll right now, but we
could modify the last access/modify/change time when the status changes
so stat(2) can be used on the file.  This is how usbfs currently
notifies userspace of changes to their files.  Would this be acceptable?

Ok, will do.
