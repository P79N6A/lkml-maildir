I decided to split this up into five parts, a simple base
patch, a patch doing the noatime stuff, and three patches
for the IS_RDONLY changes ...
bme0.04.1-ro1 ... are the completely resolved ones
bme0.04.1-ro2 ... acl stuff, needs checking for nd
bme0.04.1-ro3 ... unresolved/legacy
currently I do not know where to get the vfsmnt for the
cases in bme0.04.1-ro3, so they use the legacy define
IS_RDONLY_INODE() for their checks ...
I hope this is what you had in mind, but anyways, let me
know how to proceed ...
best,
Herbert
PS: basic functionality has been verified.
