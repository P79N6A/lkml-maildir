That is not true.
If there's enough RAM for directory cache, the directory size is
irrelevant. Directory is scanned when file is first open and
then entry is in fast global cache. Organisation of directory tree and
directory sizes doesn't affect lookup speed at all.
When your'e getting short on memory or you're listing directory,
linear ext2 directory structure will slow down operation, however.
