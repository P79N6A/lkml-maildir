I doubt they would prefer the later ordering in any way that matters, if 
the Windows version they were designed for uses the earlier ordering.
It would be best if somebody could manage to find out what ordering 
Windows XP (and Windows Vista, for good measure) actually use, then we 
could just use that. Virtual machine trickery might be an option - the 
only complication being that it'll be using the DSDT for the fake 
machine and not the real one..
