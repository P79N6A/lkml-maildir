I took the latest Chelsio driver and gave it a TOE lobotomy so here
is a version to test, it is large so see git repository at:
  git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/shemminger/chelsio-2.6.git
This is a clone of jeff's netdev-2.6 tree, and the chelsio stuff is on
the chelsio branch.
This took me an afternoon, so I don't see why Chelsio didn't do it.
    Port of Chelsio's 2.2.0 version driver from:
        
http://service.chelsio.com/drivers/linux/t210/cxgb2toe-2.2.0.tar.gz
    De-vendorized:
        - removed all TCP Offload Engine support because those changes
          will not be accepted in mainline kernel.
        - new files run through Lindent
        - removed code that was '#ifdef' for older kernel versions
        - fix for 2.6.19 irq
        - replace usage of TSC with ktime
        - remove /proc trace debug stuff
        - remove dead code
        - incorporate GSO, etc.
        - get rid of FILE_IDENT() macro
        - fix sparse warnings by adding __iomem and __user
