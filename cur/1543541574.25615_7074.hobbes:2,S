Linus, 
the HFS guys made a point of making the filesystem capable of being
tar-copied. I think that this is a useful feature. It's not that we
can't change tar: We have the source. It's that lots of Unix programs
make assumptions (similar to what tar does) about what a directory
tree looks like. Now you've never wanted to use tar to copy a
/procfs. But it works on NFS.
So, (I must've missed the first part of this discussion) what's wrong
with the HFS way of doing things?
	~/myfile              (data fork)
	~/.resource/myfile    (resource fork)
This may not be "generic" enough for abitrarily named forks. Think of
something that IS. It's not all that hard:
	~/myfile                   (data/default fork)
	~/.streams/myfile/resource (resource fork)
	~/.streams/myfile/Icon     (icon fork)
	~/.streams/myfile/default  (hardlink to ~/myfile )
Advantages:
- Tar-copyable. 
- Unix utilities don't see anything odd. 
- ls will show you just the "files" (unless -a or -R). 
Disadvantages:
- The resource fork is a bit "far" away from the data
  fork. (myfile/data and myfile/resource are indeed closer)
Anything I've missed?
				Roger.
