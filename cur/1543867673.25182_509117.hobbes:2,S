Nope, just one thread. Well, two, if you consider the "main" dispatch 
thread, and the syscall service thread.

But at that point you don't need to have complex atom interfaces, with 
chains, whips and leather pants :) Just code it in C and submit that to 
the async engine. The longer is the chain though, the closer you get to a 
fully multithreaded solution, in terms of service thread consuption. And 
what do you save WRT a multithreaded solution? Not thread 
creation/destroy, because that cost is fully amortized inside the chain 
execution cost (plus a pool would even save that).
IMO the plus of a generic async engine is mostly from a kernel code 
maintainance POV. You don't need anymore to have AIO-aware code paths, 
that automatically transalte to smaller and more maintainable code.
