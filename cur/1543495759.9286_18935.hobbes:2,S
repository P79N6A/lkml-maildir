As long as you don't mind unmounting the file-system at that time it's
easy.
Write a program that does this:
	su root
	ifconfig eth0 down
	ifconfig lo down
	kill -TERM -1
	sync
	kill -KILL -1
	umount /your/filesystem (even root)
	open("/your/filesystem/partition", O_RDWR)
	while(!done)
        {
           old_position = get_file_position();
           read() data into a buffer;
           set_file_position(old_position);
           write() data from buffer;
        }
        close()
	reboot()
The major problem is finding out when you have reached the end of the
partition or physical device. This is because any sector read errors
(after near kernel panics) can result in the same indication to
a program that a normal EOF would result in, i.e., the return value
from the read is not the same as requested (normal last read), or
-1 with errno set to something if you read beyond that.
