Just FYI, a really really quick and dirty way of testing this sort of thing on 
more architectures and you're likely to physically have?
1) Install QEMU.
2) Grab 
http://landley.net/code/firmware
 (releases in the downloads directory, 
or tarball of most recent repository snapshot is 
wget "
http://landley.net/hg/firmware?ca=tip;type=gz"
).
3) Edit "download.sh" to point at the URL of your tarball instead of whatever 
kernel.org version it's using.  (Or add your patch to sources/patches if it 
applies to the version it's already using.  Note that if you set SHA1= blank 
in download.sh it'll skip the checksum test, so you don't have to recalculate 
the sha1sum if you don't want to.)
4) Run ./build.sh for the architecture you're interested in.  (I suggest 
armv4l, i686, mipsel, and x86_64.  Both sparc and ppc are currently broken 
for different reasons; I'm working on it.)  Wait a longish time for it to 
finish compiling. :)
5) "cd build; ./run-armv4l.sh" and your shell prompt should now be in qemu 
running a kernel for the appropriate architecture.  (You even have a native 
version of gcc you can build stuff with, although you may have 
to "ln -s /tools/lib /lib" to run the results, for reasons Linux From Scratch 
developers will recognize. :)
This won't help you test real hardware (at least hardware qemu doesn't 
emulate), but for stuff like filesystems or executable file formats, it's 
handy. :)
Email me if something doesn't work...
