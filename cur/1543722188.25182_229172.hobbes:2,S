Subject: [PATCH] Export msi_remove_pci_irq_vectors
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

As a followup to my previous post about the request_mem_region in
msi.c, I noticed that the region is only released in
msi_remove_pci_irq_vectors().  Based on the fact that this function is
declared in linux/pci.h (and stubbed out if CONFIG_PCI_USE_VECTOR is
not defined), I'm guessing that the intent is for a device driver to
unconditionally call this when exiting.
However, a module can't call msi_remove_pci_irq_vectors unless the
symbol is exported... so if this is the way to do things, please apply
this patch.
On the other hand, MSI-HOWTO.txt seems to imply that the 0th MSI
vector should be cleaned up just by calling free_irq... so should
pci_disable_msi be calling msi_remove_pci_irq_vectors?
