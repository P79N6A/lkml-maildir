Hi - try MOSIX, a very cool-looking clustering solution for Linux, 
applied as a kernel patch to 2.2 kernels. The site is at:
       
http://www.mosix.cs.huji.ac.il/
There are other solutions out there, but this one looks pretty promising 
to me. I'm aware of others who are about to implement it, though I have 
no direct experience myself.
Hope this helps.
Alastair
