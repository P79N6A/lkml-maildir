I had the same reaction... is testing cpu_user_features really the
best way to detect this issue?
I'll hold off applying this for a few days so you guys can decide the
best thing to do.  We'll definitely get some fix into 2.6.24 but we
have time to make a good decision.

It does seem that the only places that the hcall_lock is taken also
use msleep, so they must always be in process context.  So you can
safely just use spin_lock(), right?
