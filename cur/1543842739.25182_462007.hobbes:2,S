Alan, sorry but I'm still having trouble understanding which aspect of 
my patch you are objecting to. I think I probably misinterpreted one of 
your earlier comments.
My patch included this comment:
> There is still a downside to this patch: if the user inserts a VIA
> PCI card into a VIA-based motherboard, in some circumstances the
> quirk will also run on
> the VIA PCI card. This corner case is hard to avoid.
To which you replied:

> This is not a "corner case"

> Very large numbers of VIA mainboards ship with some of the VIA devices

and later followed up with:

The scenario you are talking about there (internal devices on PCI bus vs 
V-bus) is different from the one I was talking about (external VIA-based 
PCI cards going into PCI slots on a VIA-based motherboard).
Regardless of that I tried to piece together what I thought you might be 
trying to say, in order to understand the NAK:
> OK, so per your last mail, most VIA devices start on the PCI bus and
> then later are migrated onto the V-bus.
> 
> Devices on the PCI bus need to be quirked (in some circumstances), as
> when they are on the PCI bus they use the IRQ line for routing, and
> the IRQ line is what the quirk actually modifies.
> 
> V-bus devices do not need the quirk because IRQ routing there is
> handled by IRQ number alone.
> 
> Is the above correct?
And then you replied:
> I've no idea. 
Can you clarify?
Thanks.
Daniel
