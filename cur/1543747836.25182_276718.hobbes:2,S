The compiler warns because you are putting a 64-bit value (an unsigned
long long) in a 32-bit value (a u32).
There is definitely a problem on non-highmem compiled kernels, there is
no doubt of that.  The concern was that your suggested fix is not right.
Assuming that a 39-bit value is really wanted, the type either needs to
be changed to a dma64_addr_t or the value needs to change at
compile-time to a suitable 32-bit variant when !CONFIG_HIGHMEM64G.
Without knowing what the driver is doing, I have no idea.
