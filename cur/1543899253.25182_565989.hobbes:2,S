The Signed-off-by stuff is sometimes one of those sad but easy little  
things we do to avoid anybody getting stuck in court over patent/ 
copyright later on, and to be able to prove that our GPLed stuff is  
actually ours to GPL.  As it's an implementation of a simple modular  
base-2 math concept I don't see any reason why you need to sign-off;  
the only person who needs to do so is Denis Vlasenko (the person who  
actually wrote the specific copyrighted code).  The real practical  
use is to be able to follow the chain of "I got this from [...]" back  
to its original source, which is especially valuable in the presence  
of scum like SCO (they claimed some of Linus' code as their own).
So I wouldn't worry about it, the only person who really needs to do  
anything is Denis.
Cheers,
