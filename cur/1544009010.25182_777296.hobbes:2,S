This is only a problem if you make your measurement quantums too
small.
Furthermore, there are multiple registers and states to update
atomically when a perf counter overflows.  You're read/write thing
just doesn't cut it, especially for certain kinds of hardware.
It's really a utopian view of the world. :)
