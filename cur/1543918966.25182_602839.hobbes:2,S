I am sorry that the format is still a little confused although I have
make some change to it to be more suitable for news group. Any way, I
think it is now readable.
Above is I/O report from 00:00 to 06:00 or some time in my machine.
There are about two main status in the report, in the first half the
whole load is very normal and the %util is about 40%. Suddenly, the
%util is up to 99% and the whole disk is in high load. I know, in that
time I run some I/O sensive task. But I can not understand that when the
%util is low the await/svctm/avgqu-sz is very high, but when the %util
is high the await/svctm/avgqu-sz is very low. I do not understand why?
I guess that maybe this has something to do with the way Linux deal with
I/O. But I can not figure out the real reason, could you please give me
some detailed explaination? Thanks in advance!
Regards!
Bo
