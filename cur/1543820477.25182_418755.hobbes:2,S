That's fine - it doesn't explain why a path-based access control
mechanism belongs in the kernel.  Or why LSM is the right way to
implement such a mechanism, given the complete mismatch in the placement
and interfaces of its hooks.
Let's keep the debate separate, please - there is one debate regarding
removal of LSM, and you've expressed your view there.  There is another
debate regarding whether AppArmor belongs in the kernel, and that
depends on the answers to the above questions.  But it isn't sufficient
to argue that because SELinux isn't the only true way that AppArmor
should be merged, eh?
