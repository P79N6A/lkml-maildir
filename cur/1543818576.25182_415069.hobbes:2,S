You are right, you do not use netlink header size explicitly in skb size
calculation during allocation, so this is ok.

Some kind of flag to specify that work is in progress, or reference
counters for subsystem, or even use mutuxes in sending path...
There are a lot of variants, from complex and fast to slow and simple.

Yes.
__kfree_skb() calls skb->destructor() callback, which can be
sock_rfree() or sock_wfree() for example, depending on socket type,
which decreases appropriate queue accounting variable.

Probably.
It is quite hard to tell how well system behaves only looking into the
code, although it tells a lot.
Create for example a lot of files, or measure some other parameters
which are more close to real life behaviour, and check the time with and without
your code turned on, how many messages were lost if any, CPU usage and
so on...
