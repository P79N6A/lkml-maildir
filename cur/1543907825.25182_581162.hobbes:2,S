Ah, ok, makes sense. Yeah, that weird "platform devices loads itself by
the name" thing got disabled in the platform subsystem. It caused
modprobe loops for other devices.
The whole idea of issuing MODALIAS with plain module names instead of
aliases can't really work, but the platform maintainer didn't like to
use the usual aliases and the matches in the modules, for a reason I
didn't understand while we talked about the problem last time.
