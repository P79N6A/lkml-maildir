It's not the compiler that is responsible for it. At least in my case.
The problem is that if you compile the glibc than some assembler code
gets included into glibc.  So the problem here is glibc and not gcc.
Ok, the way to go for me now will be to make a new glibc without this
instructions. But I still think it would be a step to more fault
tolerance (or tolerance to goofy admins ;-) if we could have an
emulation of this. If I find some time I will do this...

Let the FS driver copy all modified sectors into a hidden log on the
disk (fixed or dynamic in size or as a ringbuffer). Then e.g during
kernel startup in case you removed most of the system you might be asked
to recover from some point. Such concepts are used by software like
HDD-Sheriff but one level below (disc sector level). On filesystem level
it makes more sense since you may recover partially. All that will bloat
the kernel but it would be possible. This case is one that has (very)
high costs. Not that I want this but I want to show that there _are_
ways to do it.
