A user uses device bus id like 'C093' to enable or disable wakeup of the
device, for example
echo "C093" > /proc/acpi/wakeup
but i think "c093" should also be ok. i.e.
"echo 'c093' > /proc/acpi/wakeup" should have the same result as "echo
'C093' > /proc/acpi/wakeup".
That is to say, it should be case-insensitive.

Not at all, i didn't find any userland application
assumes /proc/acpi/wakeup must be that kind of format.
In fact, /proc output is always changing. :-)

PCI ID can be gotten from sysfs, but it is a unique identifier for a
device, a user can get device name from /usr/share/hwdata/pci.ids in any
dstribution by PCI ID, he/she is unnecessary to use bus number to get
device name, bus number is platform-specific, but PCI ID is
platform-independent.
