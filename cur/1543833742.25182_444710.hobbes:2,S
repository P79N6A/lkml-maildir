Hardware
IBM ThinkPad T42
E1000 card info: 
02:01.0 Ethernet controller: Intel Corporation 82540EP Gigabit Ethernet 
Controller (Mobile) (rev 03)
        Subsystem: IBM PRO/1000 MT Mobile Connection
        Flags: bus master, 66MHz, medium devsel, latency 64, IRQ 9
        Memory at c0220000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=128K]
        Memory at c0200000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=64K]
        I/O ports at 8000 [size=64]
        [virtual] Expansion ROM at ec000000 [disabled] [size=64K]
        Capabilities: [dc] Power Management version 2
Steps to reproduce:
1) Suspend to disk normally
2) Resume from disk, the e1000 will show garbage for network statistics.

Did something change in the driver that forgot to save the registers / not 
register back upon resumption from disk? I can't tell from the code how the 
driver knows its been brought down to S3 or S4 states.
 
A workaround is to then suspend to memory and resume, the e1000 will work 
again. This is repeatable each time.
Not sure if anyone else noticed this.
Thanks, 
Shawn.
