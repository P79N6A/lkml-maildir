Yeah. I'm not surprised. A real mode-sense shouldn't be even 64 bytes, 
much less 96, so it shouldn't have overflowed, and we had no indication of 
the corruption spreading past the one allocation anyway.
It did/does seem a bug, though, so worth checking.
So onward in our tireless battle. Does this patch make any difference for 
you? It does two things:
 - it clears the "->sense" buffer in blk_end_sync_rq() (since it won't be 
   valid any more: the request is gone)
 - it adds a BUG_ON() if we appear to have already done the sense fill on 
   SCSI IO completion, and do it again.
Now, I've not tried either of these, and the BUG_ON() in particular might 
be a false positive itself, but it might be worth testing.
