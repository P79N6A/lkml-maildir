    And this is why the code has the paranoid #ifdef in it;  Nathan is
    looking at it from the viewpoint that The Computer Is Your Friend,
    and I'm looking at it from the viewpoint that it's not worthwhile
    to cater to the suicidal bios vendors.
    I'm not willing to override him;  I'm not sure what he thought, but
    in any case I was running under the impression that the ifdeffed
    code would satisfy both my desire for non-nonsense code and his
    desire to work around the suicidal.
    The Sunday patch does little more than change the existing e820 code
    to return more data so that additional validations can be put in.
    The detail that everyone who runs 2.3.x (x>18) isn't beating down
    the doors to fix memory detection not working is, to me, a fairly
    compelling reason to not make %es:%di checking mandatory.   I'd
    rather have the paranoid ifdef in the kernel side, but I'm willing
    to defer that until later on.

    david parsons \bi/ I test with paranoid on, but my production machines
                   \/                                run with paranoid off.
