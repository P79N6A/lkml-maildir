Not all non-rotational SSDs are created equal (as Intel said).
Some SSD performs better as the I/O queue length increase, while others not.
For SSD with scalable queueing performance, it might be better to allow
multiple discrete I/Os.
I'm not sure if "non-rotational" is well suited for tuning the
behavior of elevator merging.
