For slab, I found that the following two patches reduce text size most 
(for i386 NUMAQ config) while keeping UMA path the same. I don't have 
actual NUMA-capable hardware so I have no way to benchmark them. Both 
patches move code out-of-line and thus introduce new function calls which 
might affect performance negatively.
