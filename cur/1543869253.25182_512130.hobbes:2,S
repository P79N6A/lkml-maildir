gitweb on kernel.org is at least in part orphanned, since the "official" 
gitweb maintainers don't seem to listen to us (kernel.org people) w.r.t. 
some issues, mainly related to caching, we've had to fork gitweb and 
maintain it ourselves -- however, since kernel.org is currently all 
volunteer labor, we have limited amount of time in which to deal with 
things.
