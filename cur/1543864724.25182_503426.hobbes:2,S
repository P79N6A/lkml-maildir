Not only is there still the abba deadlock on page locks, as you point
out in your next mail, but there is also an abba on page lock vs mmap_sem.

Ignoring the cleanup patches, the only thing mine really do is to use
get_user_pages in  generic_file_buffered_write if the destination page
is not uptodate, and use atomic copies if it is. Conceptually pretty simple.
Mine fixes the writev performance regression iff the destination page
it uptodate. More importantly, they fix 3 deadlocks in the core mm.
