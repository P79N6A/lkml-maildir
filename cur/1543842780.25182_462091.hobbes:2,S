This approach will minimize driver changes, and would imply the removal 
of some existing mmiowb() and wmb() macros.

If we accept this, I don't think we're much better off than we are 
currently (not that I have a problem with that).  That is, many drivers 
would still need to be fixed up.

Depends on what you mean by "ordered between MMIO and MMIO".  mmiowb() 
was initially introduced to allow ordering of writes between CPUs, and 
really didn't say anything about memory vs. I/O, so the semantics you 
describe here would also be different (and more expensive) than what we 
have now.

This is what mmiowb() is supposed to be, though only for writes.  I.e. 
two writes from different CPUs may arrive out of order if you don't use 
mmiowb() carefully.  Do you also need a mmiorb() macro or just a 
stronger mmiob()?

mmiowb() could be written as io_to_io_write_barrier() if we wanted to be 
extra verbose.  AIUI it's the same thing as smb_wmb() but for MMIO 
space.
