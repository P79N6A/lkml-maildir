This kvm release introduces guest smp.  I've tested 4-way Linux (64-bit 
and 32-bit) and 2-way Windows XP.  A kernel build on 2-way 64-bit Linux 
is 40% faster that on a uniprocessor guest.  Expect performance to 
improve as the in-kernel apic work is merged and as we tune kvm for smp.
Changes from kvm-29:
- minor fixes and cleanups  (Jeff Dike, Rusty Russell, me)
- kernel pio string write (Eddie Dong)
- guest smp kernel fixes
- rdmsr and wrmsr real mode emulation
- fix real mode shadow pages aliasing nx large page shadows
- enable guest smp in qemu
- fix external module installer
- revert ide enable changes that caused an I/O regression
Notes:
    If you use the modules from kvm-30, you can use any version of Linux
from 2.6.9 upwards.
    If you use the modules from Linux 2.6.20, you need to use kvm-12.
    If you use the modules from Linux 2.6.21, you need to use kvm-17.
    Modules from Linux 2.6.22 and up will work with any kvm version from
kvm-22.  Some features may only be available in newer releases.
