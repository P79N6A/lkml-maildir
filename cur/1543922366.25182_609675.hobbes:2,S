Well that's exactly right. For threaded programs (and maybe even
real-world non-threaded ones in general), you don't want to be
even _reading_ global variables if you don't need to. Cache misses
and cacheline bouncing could easily cause performance to completely
tank in some cases while only gaining a cycle or two in
microbenchmarks for doing these funny x86 predication things.
I'm not sure about ia64 -- I _hope_ that for most of their
predication stuff, they also predicate the stores, rather than
just store unconditionally and rely on the source operand not
changing in the case they didn't intend the memory to change.
