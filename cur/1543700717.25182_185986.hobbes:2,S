It's not a kernel change needed, it's a udev/libsysfs change needed.  If
I didn't have to deal with devfs emails I would get a chance to work on
the issue some more :)
And yes, I have gotten tired of the boot issue too, just add a '&' after
the udev call in your init scripts and then everything seems to work
just fine (as far as speed of boot goes.)
And sorry for the Gentoo comment, it wasn't aimed at the developers at
all.  You have helped out a bunch with udev development, and I
appreciate it.  I also appreciate the chore you are undertaking in
moving away from devfs, that's a great step.
But you do have to admit, Gentoo seems to have some pretty rabid users :)
thanks,
