Hi,
	I figured out my routing problems which were causing
MASQUERADE: Route sent us somewhere else.
messages from the kernel. I use iptables to masquerade and mangle
packets so with the advanced router features i can send it out
appropriate interfaces (i.e. web traffic out my residential ISP service
not my commercial ISP service). See the earlier thread on this for more
info (Subject 2.4.23 masquerading broken?). I got a useful reply from
Martin Josefsson who suggested that ipt_MASQUERADE could no longer find
the input-interface anymore. Upon further investigation and it seems all
the rules with iif or from in them no longer work (at least for me). So
rules like the following will cause the error in post 2.4.22 kernels.
ip rule add pri 420 from IP lookup TABLE
I now use exclusively rules of the form 
ip rule add pri 420 fwmark MARK table TABLE
and mark all packets needing special routing with mangling rules such as
iptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -s IP -j MARK --set-mark MARK
this seems to prevent the problem. Don't know what changed in the
kernel.
