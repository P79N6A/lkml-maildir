Agreed that some things are more important than others. But to some
people, user interface does matter. After all, we want (well I want)
people considering converting from Windows to see that free software can
be better than proprietary stuff, not just imitate what they're doing. 
Suspend2 doesn't actually provide dancing penguins while suspending -
it's a simple progress bar in either pure text or overlayed on an image
of your choosing.
The support for aborting is really just fall out from the work on
debugging and testing failure paths.

(Or me - Suspend2 doesn't touch drivers, though I do from time to time
include driver patches that a good number of people seem to need, while
I wait for them to be merged upstream).

Amen.
