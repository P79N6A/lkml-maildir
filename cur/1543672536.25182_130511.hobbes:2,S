Hello,
I'm trying to connect a laptop to a my home computer using a PLIP 
connection. On both computers, I've a Linux Mandrake 9.0 with a kernel 
2.4.20.
In /etc/hosts, I have pc.home.org 198.168.0.1 and laptop.home.org 
198.168.0.2
For /etc/hosts.allow and /etc/hosts.deny, I've followed the PLIP-HOWTO 
advices.
I've configured the parport_pc module (for both pc):
insmod parport_pc io=0x378 irq=7
The kernel messages are fine with this configuration.
Then I had the plip module (insmod plip).
On the laptop, I do:
ifconfig plip0 laptop.home.org pointopoint pc.home.org netmask 
255.255.255.255 up
route add -host pc.home.org dev plip0
And on my home computer I do:
ifconfig plip0 pc.home.org pointopoint laptop.home.org netmask 
255.255.255.255 up
route add -host laptop.home.org dev plip0
On the laptop, when I ping the pc, nothing happens and on the pc, when I 
 ping the laptop, nothing happens too.
I don't knwo where I am wrong:
- Maybe my parport in not really bidirectionnal on my laptop (how can I 
now if a parport can communicate ?)
- Maybe there's a problem with the way I configure the plip module (I 
don't known how to dive into the kernel sources to extract informations 
about how to configure a module. There are no information about the plip 
module in the kernel documentation).
Your sincerely,
Yann COLLETTE
