Good ;)

Known. I have to work on this next

8 is the default and works fine. 15,16 and 32 work but the cursor isn't
properly rendered, this is a known fbdev problem in 2.4, I'll probably
fix it by implementing HW cursor support in radeonfb. 24 bpp is a weird
mode that isn't really supported by the driver

What is a bug ? the delays ? The fact that some apps leave garbage ? The
former is normal when an actual mode switch occurs. The later is a
problem with apps that bang the HW (and with X as well in some cases as
it will occasionally fuck up the accel engine configuration).
The problem is that currently, the fbcon/fbdev interface doesn't provide
a hook for fbdev's to force a restore of the mode & engine setting when
an app leaves the KD_GRAPHICS mode.

The "new" consoles aren't initialized, thus the driver do a mode change
when switching to them. Well... I can try to fix that...
