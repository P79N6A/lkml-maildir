On doing a 'make' and 'make modules' eerything seems fine.
Still fine after 'make module_install'
But the 'make install' generates the error message:
    grubby fatal error: unable to find a suitable template
THe kernel does appear to have been installed in boot, but 
I havent a clue what this error message is trying to tell me.
