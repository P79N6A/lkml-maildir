I would really like to know how to control robots without RTL - if you
think I could leave robot-arms for 5ms without commands,  you are
definitily
wrong.
I'm watching this long debate - and the more I read the more I get
confused -
with this approach to the problem I'm getting feeling, that the Linux
is simple bad choice for big range of applications and it will stays
this way
forever.
Why there just can't be an option for RT processing ? - if someone
doesn't needed it,
it may leave it turned off (with all the drivers who need RTL
inaccessible).
Its not a problem for me to reapair rejects when applying  RTL patches
to
newer kernel, however I don't think it should stay this way forever.
This is realy something I don't understand.

Again wrong (thought I'm not using 900MHz Duron) - the computers will
never be fast enough! (I think B.Gates gets famous for sentences like
this)
You can always ask to do more jobs for the computer.
And speeking about non-rtl responsivity - even with `nice 20` I had to
kill
seti client on my dual CPU 480MHz when I normaly work with it - as I
could feel the 'slowness'
caused by this low priority task (using 2.2.17pre9-SMP kernel)
(BTW  once I had a patch (2.2.14 kernel) called ADAPT which dramaticaly
increased responisivness of the whole system (I could run even e.g. two
burnBX 
program without even knowing about them - this patch has never been
discussed on
linux konference)

Could you look at the RTL patch please and point out which parts do
you consider as a horrible cludge - as this is the only way it could
be fixed/improved.
I can always hear that Linus(you) won't allow the RTL to go into
mainstream kernel
because its uggly hack, however I would like to know the reason for
this, 
and also I would like to know what should be fixed and why this can't be
included
as an experimental feature?
