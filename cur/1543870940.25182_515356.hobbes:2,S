I'm sorry, you misunderstand: I meant the above steps as a method of
confirming that SysRQ normally still works while X is running, not as
anything useful to do after your system has hung.
Now that I re-read what you wrote initially, however, I think I somewhat
misunderstood what you wrote anyway, and you probably already knew that
SyrRQ worked in X.
Anyway...

Yeah, that's pretty indicative. As for me, I just tried disabling
CONFIG_CC_OPTIMIZE_FOR_SIZE; so far so good, but I don't even have 4
hours uptime yet. We'll see.

Nothing really in common with mine. Oh well.
