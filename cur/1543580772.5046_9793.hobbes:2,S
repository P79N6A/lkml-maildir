Just some fine tuning on that answer. The relevant kernel 
boot time option in the 2.4 series is "scsihosts" and it 
is available whether or not devfs is selected. [Richard
Gooch did introduce this option together with devfs. It
is now part of the scsi mid level code.]
If you apply Richard's devfs patch to the lk 2.2 series
you will also get the "scsihosts" kernel boot time option
(but I suspect it doesn't work as it needed to some
tweaking in 2.4).
As for scsi device naming issues, you could look at:

for more information.
