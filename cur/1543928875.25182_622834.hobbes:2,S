Here are the ones from a normal bootup.
I was unable to get info from a kdump boot. I haven't figured out why 
yet. With the same patch that I used to capture this, when I tried to 
kdump the kernel, it paused a second or two after the backtrace and then 
dropped to BIOS and came up normally.
Here is a little trick, at the point where we are trying to get the info 
to print out, the kernel command line hasn't been completely parsed yet. 
That tricked me for part of the day. I had apic=debug on the command 
line but the logic in print_local_APIC saw the default value because the 
kernel command line had yet to be parsed.
