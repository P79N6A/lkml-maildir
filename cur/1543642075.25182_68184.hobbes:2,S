Sweet, we're an axis now!  That's much better than the other terms Pat
and I have been called in the past...  And everyone knows what's the
next size jump up from axis :)
So here's how driverfs fits into the big picture in one sentance:
	Anything that does not have to do with processes 
	will go into driverfs.
So in this example, we are exporting a number of boot devices as the
bios told us, so apply the rule stated above, and determine if it should
go into /proc or not[1].
thanks,

[1]  Yes, it's still a bit difficult to figure how to add files to
driverfs, if you aren't starting with a "struct device" or "struct
device_driver", but I have seen some very nice documentation on how to
do it properly written by Pat involving a wonderful example of beer, and
I'm sure that once he gets back into internet connectivity range, he'll
be updating it and adding it to the Documentation directory.  That
should be by the end of the week or so.
