That's Microsoft's problem -- that's a fundamental limit of the format
they defined.  The fact that they defined it in the first place is
part of the problem (the only way you can make a FAT filesystem work
*well* is by loading the entire FAT into memory ahead of time, and
"FAT32" breaks that), instead of creating a more sensible
replacement.
(FWIW, the reason they used to justify FAT32 was "it would be too much
work to make DOS handle NTFS", as if those were the only options...)
