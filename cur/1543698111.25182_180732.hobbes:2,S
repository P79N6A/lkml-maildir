"Wrong" - what a pessimism. That URL just confirms what I wrote:
Windows XP has no such restriction. If you explicitly ask Windows XP
to use oldfashioned means, then of course that is your own choice.

Ha, now we are getting down to business.
*fdisk evolves in time, so the answer is very version dependent.
Let me answer for today's fdisk.
Disk geometry is determined as follows (see fdisk.c:get_geometry())
        heads = user_heads ? user_heads :
                pt_heads ? pt_heads :
                kern_heads ? kern_heads : 255;
        sectors = user_sectors ? user_sectors :
                pt_sectors ? pt_sectors :
                kern_sectors ? kern_sectors : 63;
that is, if the user has specified a geometry on the command line,
then that is what we use; otherwise, if there is a partition
table already and we are able to guess a geometry from that, use that;
otherwise, if the kernel has some idea, use that; finally use */255/63
when no information is available.
