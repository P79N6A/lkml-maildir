Uhm, no.  There is no reason an "unimportant" person couldn't review a 
patch, and therefore perform a potentially highly valuable service to 
the maintainer.
None of these are indicative of the authority of the person acking, 
reviewing, testing, or nacking.  That's only as good as the trust in the 
person signing.
