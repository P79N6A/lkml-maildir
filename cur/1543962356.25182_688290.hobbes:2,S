No that was the unrefreshed version. I had the patch around for some
time and then updated and noticed Jan's change that added the ecx
clobber and added that one too but unfortunately with typo, which
was then caught, but then forgot to quilt refresh before posting. I
reposted with the correct version now.
Thanks for looking.
