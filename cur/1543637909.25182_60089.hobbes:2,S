Agreed, we need some sort of irqbalance, and I intend to test with Ingo's and 
Andrea's approaches. With that addition, I may even see an improvement with 
hyperthreading. But for an rc release, I think it would be prudent to revert 
the "new code" for default hyperthreading behavior, and attack the whole 
problem in 2.4.20 or later release.
