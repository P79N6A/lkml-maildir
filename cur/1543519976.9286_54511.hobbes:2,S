Subject: [OT] format of scsi return codes?

I have a bogey drive and the kernel keeps reporting "... I/O error .....
return code = 26030000" on any accesses to it.
I have the manufacturers list of error codes for that drive as a table of 
Sense Key / Sense Code / Qualifier / UEC
Would anyone know how to translate the scsi layers interpretation of the
return code into that of the manufacturers?
thanks,
Paul Jakma.
