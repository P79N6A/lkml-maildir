 mutex doesn't have a owner, or if we can steal the mutex from a pending
 owner.  Let's look at the situations we have here.
-1) Has owner that is pending
-----------------------------
-The mutex has a owner, but it hasn't woken up and the mutex flag
-"Pending Owner" is set.  The first check is to see if the owner isn't the
-current task.  This is because this function is also used for the pending
-owner to grab the mutex.  When a pending owner wakes up, it checks to see
-if it can take the mutex, and this is done if the owner is already set to
-itself.  If so, we succeed and leave the function, clearing the "Pending
-Owner" bit.
-
-If the pending owner is not current, we check to see if the current priority is
-higher than the pending owner.  If not, we fail the function and return.
-
-There's also something special about a pending owner.  That is a pending owner
-is never blocked on a mutex.  So there is no PI chain to worry about.  It also
-means that if the mutex doesn't have any waiters, there's no accounting needed
-to update the pending owner's pi_list, since we only worry about processes
-blocked on the current mutex.
-
-If there are waiters on this mutex, and we just stole the ownership, we need
-to take the top waiter, remove it from the pi_list of the pending owner, and
-add it to the current pi_list.  Note that at this moment, the pending owner
-is no longer on the list of waiters.  This is fine, since the pending owner
-would add itself back when it realizes that it had the ownership stolen
-from itself.  When the pending owner tries to grab the mutex, it will fail
-in try_to_take_rt_mutex if the owner field points to another process.
-
-2) No owner
------------
-
-If there is no owner (or we successfully stole the lock), we set the owner
-of the mutex to current, and set the flag of "Has Waiters" if the current
-mutex actually has waiters, or we clear the flag if it doesn't.  See, it was
-OK that we set that flag early, since now it is cleared.
-
-3) Failed to grab ownership
----------------------------

-The most interesting case is when we fail to take ownership. This means that
-there exists an owner, or there's a pending owner with equal or higher
-priority than the current task.
