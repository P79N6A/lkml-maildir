   thanks, that makes sense, I tried ExplorerPS/2, it works better, the 
wheel works but side button is still same as button 2.
   would it be different if I used /dev/input/mouse0? or 
/dev/input/mice?  kernel Documentation/input/input.txt seems to be 
fairly old (mentions  2.5/2.6 in future tense) and it says to use 
"ExplorerPS/2 if you want to use extra (up to 5) buttons" when 
discussing what /dev/input/mouse0 provides. Does that mean that there's 
no way to use extra side button (which is the sixth button)?
