I ported my VM code to 2.2.10. You need this patch to avoid swapouts even
if the system has plenty of memory used as cache. It will also give you an
high improvement both during swap and VM load. You need such VM code also
if you are getting complete lockups due out of memory.
I merged in the patch also my reschedule_idle() code and the fix for the
SCHED_YIELD from Ingo Molnar (these are the only two not-VM-related-things
in the patch).
You can donwload the VM patch against 2.2.10 from here:
