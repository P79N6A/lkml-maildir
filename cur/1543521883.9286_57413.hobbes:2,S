Wrong.  The 0.90 RAID code has yet to exist in the 2.3 tree, although
Ingo is still working on it.  You can check the linux-raid archives
for posts from him and Tweedie that address the issues very well.
Ingo recently release the new RAID code against 2.2.14 in case you want
to use that as a base

The issues involved are far from trivial, but the work isn't impossible
and it's getting done.  Alan has listed RAID 0.90 on his 2.3.x TODO list
and Ingo is in agreement that the new raid code "has to be merged into
2.4 or 2.5 (as soon as possible)"
Rest assured the current MD state isn't just being ignored :)
