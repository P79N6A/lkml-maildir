Not suspended.  _Frozen_.  In fact don't want any DMA transfers or interrupts
to take place when we're creating the image.  That's all and that's what we're
doing (or rather, trying to do).
So, the "suspend" and "resume" for the functions being called for that are
wrong, but then we call them with PMSG_FREEZE. ;-)  Still, we could add
.freeze() and .thaw() callbacks for hibernation just fine.  This wouldn't even
be that difficult ...
Greetings,
Rafael
