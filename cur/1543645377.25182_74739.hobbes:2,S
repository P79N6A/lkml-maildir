I used to have this problem with 2.5 too
It went from the IDE controller chipset.
Are you sure that you have only 1 IDE controller chipset ?
I have both PIIX4 and HPT366. Root FS is on HPT366 controller. Enabling
only PIIX4 used to work with 2.4 but doesn't with 2.5 anymore (got
exactly your problem). I had to enable specific support for both.
I suppose your root FS is on a specific IDE controller for which the
support is not enabled (check the different type in the IDE/ATA kernel
config section)
