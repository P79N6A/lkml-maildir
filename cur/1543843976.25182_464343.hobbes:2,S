Thats great but entirely irrelevant in this context. The patch and caps 
in question are not attached to the file via some externally observable 
property (eg., xattr) but instead are embedded in the source code so 
that it can drop caps at certain points during the execution or before 
executing another app, thus unanalyzable.
