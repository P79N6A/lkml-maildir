Watch out if your driver is unloaded, but the device is still hanging
around.  If that could happen, you need to get rid of those attributes.
But the main reason is we want to split attributes out of sysfs to make
sysfs simpler, and provide the ability for other representations of the
driver tree other than sysfs.  But more about this at the kernel
summit...

will get to it by the end of the week, sorry for the delay.
