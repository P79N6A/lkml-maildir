I use an isdn line and get assigned a dynamic ip-adress. 
Since my isp charges seconds-wise of online-time I want to wast as
little as possible.
I noticed that the tcp_v4_rebuild_header()-call occures not right after
I got a new ip-adress but at (more or less) random intervals afterwards.
I checked net/ipv4/tcp_ipv4.c and found the 
struct tcp_func ipv4_specific = {
...
tcp_v4_rebuild_header,
...
};
 
I guess these functions are evaluated after some timeout or resheduled
every now and then. Would it make sense to do that 
a) more often
or 
b) after a dialup?
How would I do so? Wouldn't that be nice for most people who use
ip_dynaddr?
