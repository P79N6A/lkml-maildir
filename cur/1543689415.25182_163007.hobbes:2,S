Write 0x80 out port 0x70, and hope nobody accesses the RTC. This
will (should) disable the NMI line. Then see if the error messages
go away. If they do, it's a real NMI and you really do have bad
RAM somewhere. If they don't, your motherboard is getting glitched
either by bad design or something plugged into a slot that doesn't
have the correct timing specs.
If everything works, in spite of the NMI, just comment out the
kernel printk() and cross your fingers.
