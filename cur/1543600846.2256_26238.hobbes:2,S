I just recently exported via NFS a file system from a 2.2.14 machine (RH 6.2) to
an old Motorola m88k system running SVR3.  A few hours thereafter, the PC
crashed.  There was no output on the console and it had to be power-cycled.  The
following appears in syslog (messages) immediately prior to the crash:
Sep 10 13:52:34 sunbelt2 kernel: nfs: RPC call returned error 111
Sep 10 13:52:34 sunbelt2 kernel: RPC: task of released request still queued!
Sep 10 13:52:34 sunbelt2 kernel: RPC: (task is on xprt_pending)
Sep 10 13:52:35 sunbelt2 kernel: nfs: RPC call returned error 111
Sep 10 13:52:35 sunbelt2 kernel: RPC: task of released request still queued!
Sep 10 13:52:35 sunbelt2 kernel: RPC: (task is on xprt_pending)
Sep 10 13:52:36 sunbelt2 kernel: nfs: RPC call returned error 111
Sep 10 13:52:36 sunbelt2 kernel: RPC: task of released request still queued!
Sep 10 13:52:36 sunbelt2 kernel: RPC: (task is on xprt_pending)
...and so on
This has happened twice now.  I tried also to mount an NFS file system exported
via the SVR3 box to the linux machine.  When i did so, the SVR3 machine
crashed.  This is the first time I've used the kernel-based server.  I've
previously (several years ago) used the user-space server with kernel 1.2.13 to
connect to the same SVR3 machine with no problems.  Is anyone aware of this
problem or its cause?
