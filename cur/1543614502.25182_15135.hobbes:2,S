Are your hard drives configured to use DMA?  I noticed that when using PIO
in linux, you definitely get some user responsiveness problems whenever
you are doing heavy disk IO.  Try turning dma mode on.  man hdparm.
However, if you say you are getting like 10sec-2min lags in
responsiveness.. i somehow doubt that is the true culprit in this case...
Also, are you using NFS and/or NIS?  These things can also really slow
down some apparently low-cost things like running ls and the like.  You
might also have bad sectors on your hard drives.  I know some hard drives
(or is it just the drivers?) internally try to repeat a read or write
request several times before reporting an error.  Sometimes your hard
drives' media are slightly bad and thus exhibit huge slowdowns whenever
they operate on the offending sectors... the drive keeps retrying and then
it succeeds with the only visible symptom being that you waited a really
long time for the request to complete.  During this time, of course, the
whole drive is retarded and cannot be accessed at all by the driver...
These are just some ideas.  Of course, since it's not so likely to be the
kernel, I thought we could rule out other more likely suspects. :)
