Summary: Patch removes incorrect documentation. Correct documentation
already exists in tree.

Kind of what I did (and changed the subject line to include PATCH). Albeit as an attachment.
This time I fought with my mail client and won. See below sig.
I found no maintainer for the documentation, did I forget to CC someone?

 overcommit_memory
 -----------------
 
-This file  contains  one  value.  The following algorithm is used to decide if
-there's enough  memory:  if  the  value of overcommit_memory is positive, then
-there's always  enough  memory. This is a useful feature, since programs often
-malloc() huge  amounts  of  memory 'just in case', while they only use a small
-part of  it.  Leaving  this value at 0 will lead to the failure of such a huge
-malloc(), when in fact the system has enough memory for the program to run.
-
-On the  other  hand,  enabling this feature can cause you to run out of memory
-and thrash the system to death, so large and/or important servers will want to
-set this value to 0.
