  - Since 2.5.62, dcache lookup is dcache_lock free. This does not affect
    normal filesystems as long as they follow proper dcache interfaces. Care
    should be taken (like holding per dentry lock) if one is racing with 
    d_lookup bringing a new dentry in dcache.
  - Since 2.5.75-bk1 onwards separate lock is used for vfsmounts instead of
    dcache_lock.
