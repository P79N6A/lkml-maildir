That's exactly what we're trying to avoid -- excessive polling of
values that don't change. It causes unnecessary system load and timer
interrupts on tickless kernels.

The kernel often doesn't know when it will get the next update. But on
the other hand, apps usually know well in advance  when they'll *want*
the next update. My proposal exploits this to get optimal behavior (if
the driver+infrastructure do the right thing).
