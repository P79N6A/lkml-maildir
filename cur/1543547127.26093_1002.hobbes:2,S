	Umm... Interesting. Could somebody familiar with TripOS tell what
size sectors had there? IOW, did it keep the metadata out-of-band or not?

	Egads... Please, pass him my compliments - one has to be _really_
perverted to do the hardlinks that way. Even QNX way of handling that
(move them into magical place after the first rename()/link() and leave
the dud in the old place) is much saner.

	Ouch... Why did he do them (links to directories, that is), in the
first place?

ObWTF: WTF did these guys drop QNX when they clearly wanted RTOS? Do they
have somebody who
	a) knew the difference between RT and TS and
	b) knew that Linux is TS?
