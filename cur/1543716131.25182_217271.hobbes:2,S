I missed -mm1; both this and -mm1 appear to be unable to detect Adaptec
39160 HBA's. I'm in the midst of bisecting this. Thus far I have the
last known-working as virgin 2.6.6-rc2, and first known broken is patch
#36 out of 308 i.e. it's probably in one of the external bk trees or
linus.patch, though linus.patch doesn't seem to have anything related.
