If that is the case though (that is it can't issue low ioport cycles),
how would have the fd6e7321...  worked in the first place ? Hrm...
strange. My understanding is that all that patch does is put junk in the
pci_dev resource structures :-) Maybe that's enough to cause the PCI
layer later on to be unhappy about them and reassign the BARs to some
place that works ? In which case, you are right, a better approach is a
quirk on this specific platform, or even better, mark 0...0x10000000
busy in ioport_resources and let the generic code clash & re-assign...
I must admit I'm a bit confused tho...
Anyway, so far, nobody is arguing in favor of keeping this patch in nor
so far trying and explanation on why it wouldn't be totally bogus, so I
suggest we revert it :-)
Cheers,
Ben.
