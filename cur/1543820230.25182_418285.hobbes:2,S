The Oops triggered in rc1 was a different one, and it was my fault.
It happend only with the combination of multiple playback capability
and the kernel OSS emulation, which wasn't tested well (who uses OSS?
:-)
But the bug reported here is a different one, currently occuring only
with mm kernel.  I'll check it later...
