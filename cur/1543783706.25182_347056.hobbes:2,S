	configfs, like sysfs, does not support ->open() or ->release()
callbacks.  And it shouldn't.  The point is to hide the complexity and
make it easier to plug into.  
	A client object should not ever have to know or care that it is
being controlled by a filesystem.  It only knows that it has a tree of
items with attributes that can be set or shown.
