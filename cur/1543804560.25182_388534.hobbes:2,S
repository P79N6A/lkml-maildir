But you're perfectly happy to make the kernel developers do the equivalent thing
when they have to maintain 2 forks (a stable and devel).  Go back and look at
the status of the 2.5 tree - there were *large* chunks of time when 2.4 or 2.5
would get an important bugfix, but the other tree wouldn't get it for *weeks*
because of the hassle of cross-porting the patch.
