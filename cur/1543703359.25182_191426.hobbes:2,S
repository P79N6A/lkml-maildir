s390's actually do something like that. They have 16 (or so) physical
processors, but if you only have licence for running 1 cpu, you use
only one. OTOH if that cpu fails, it transfers state to next one and
continues.
Well, what you described could gain you some extra speed (relative to
uniprocessor), but it would be prohibitely expensive.
Wait.
We have it today.
Remember P4's? Those beasts have 90W but cooling designed only for 75W
or so, and thermal diode that slows when they get too hot.
If someone has SMP-P4 with such broken cooling solution (not sure how
common they are), ping-ponging task might actually get you extra
speed.
Same goes for any SMP machine whose CPU fans failed and is therefore
thermal-throttled. (But I'm not sure if thermal-throttling works at
all at SMPs.)
[I have one notebook here that has failed cpu fan... Thermal
throttling works more or less okay, but if you want your computation
to go fast, you need to place it next to fan...]
