Subject: Re: [PATCH 1/3] powerpc: Make rtas console _much_ faster
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I'll clean this one up a little before merging it as per Ryan's email of
a week or two ago. New patch today or tomorrow.
Even though this is 1/3 the rest of the series should be fine to merge,
right Arnd?
cheers
