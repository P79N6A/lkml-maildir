The patches look good, but I would still prefer to understand why the 
current implementation causes crashes before rewriting everything.
I've just noticed that netpoll_send_skb() calls ->hard_start_xmit() and 
->poll() within local_irq_save().
Thus it seems that  spin_lock_irqsave() must be used in the poll() and 
hard_start_xmit() callbacks, at least in nics that support 
POLL_CONTROLLER :-(
