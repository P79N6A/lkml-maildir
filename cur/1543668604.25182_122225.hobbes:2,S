I talked about this problem on LKML around 2.5.59.
If you use an ACPI battery monitor (I notice you are on a laptop and
you have ACPI enabled), there is a lot of Bad Mojo (TM) in psmouse.c
at the moment. Just don't use it if you have a synaptics touchpad, and
things should work out immediately.
Anyone who can comment on the status of this problem? I'd like to get
it fixed too, personally, but I haven't been worrying much about it
of late.
Regards
Josh
