I wasn't aware of that. At least for via-rhine, I tracked the history
down back when I investigated the bug. IIRC the bug was introduced when
set_bit was replaced.

As I have pointed out before, I verified for Linux 2.6 that without
the patch, multicasting worked on x86 but not on ppc, and that with
the patch multicasting did work on both platforms. If in 2.4 you prefer
stability over fixes for bugs nobody complained about that's fine by
me, though.
I am more concerned with the remaining drivers that at first glance
looked like they had the same problem (atp, winbond, tulip_core) in
2.6. Did anyone ever test these, or try the patches I posted? The only
feedback I remember was on typhoon, which looked okay to me and indeed
turned out to work.
