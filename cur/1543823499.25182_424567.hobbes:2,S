I noticed a rdma/message max size limitation of 4096 the last time I ran 
some dapl tests. Are there plans to increase or did I miss it somewhere 
in all the patches?
Here are the max values returned from the ipath ibv_query_device:
query_hca: (ver=20401) ep 65535 ep_q 65535 evd 65535 evd_q 65535
query_hca: msg 4096 rdma 4096 iov 255 lmr 65535 rmr 0
query_hca:  dto 65535 iov 255 rdma i1,o1
Thanks,
