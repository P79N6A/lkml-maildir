Greetings;
I'm running fedora FC1, but with the most recent 2.6.7-rc3-mm2 kernel, 
however this doesn't seem to be particularly kernel version 
sensitive.  I first noted this maybe 3 or 4 years ago, and its bit me 
maybe 3 or 4 times since.
If I use mtx (version in this instant case is 1.2.18rel) to manipulate 
my tape changer, and there is an error in loading the tape (which it 
actually did just fine by the way), the only apparent recovery seems 
to be a reboot as /dev/sg1 is no longer functioning for the amanda 
required usages after the error.
Is this a known bug, or something rather obscure?
