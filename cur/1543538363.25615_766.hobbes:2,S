Hi, Roger, Linus, others!
2.4.0-test3-pre4 (which includes this patch) is really a pleasant
surprise. The I/O bandwidth has greatly improved and I'm still trying
to understand how can patch this simple be so effective. :)
Great work Roger!
I see this as the first (and most critical) step of returning my faith
in good performing 2.4.0-final.
Keep up the good work!
