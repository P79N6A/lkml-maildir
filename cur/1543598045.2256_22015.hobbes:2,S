Hello,
since i upgraded to kernel 2.4.8/2.4.9, i noticed everything became noticably 
slower, and the number of swapins/swapouts increased significantly. When i 
run 'vmstat 1' i see there is a lot of swap activity constantly when i am 
reading my mail in kmail. After a fresh bootup in the evening, i can get 
everything I normally need swapped out by running updatedb or ht://dig. When 
i do that, my music stops playing for several seconds, and it takes about 3 
seconds before my applications repaint when i switch back to X after an 
updatedb run.
the last time that happent (and the last time i had problems with VM at all) 
was in 2.4.0-testXX so i think something is wrong ...
is it possible new used_once does not work for me (and drop_behind used to 
work fine) ?
My system configuration : athlon 750, 384 meg ram, 128 meg swap, XFree4.1 and 
kde2.2.
Greetings,
Frank
