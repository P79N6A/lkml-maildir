I did not try 2.2.12, i can't bring the fw down right now.
I disabled these options:
netlink socket,
socket filtering,
advanced router,
transparent proxy,
config_ip_masqerade_mod and
aliasing support.
Now it works like a rock. I wonder is any of these configs are
known to fail when conbined...
Problem was/is that i can disable/enable them one at a time to
figure out what combinations that makes the kernel lock, coz it
would be too long downtime. Maybe later in the week i can that.
One strange thing was that i couldn't disable some of these options
they kept popping back all the time (xconfig,menuconfig) so i had
to reconfigure a fresh 2.2.13 kernel.
