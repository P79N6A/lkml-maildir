Your .config was not attached.
There is a devfs mounting problem in 2.5.54.  If you're using devfs
you may find that

The device node exists in /dev.  It sounds like no kernel driver
has registered itself against tht node's major/minor.   Make really
sure that you have compiled the appropriate driver for your hardware;
things may have changed.  All else fails, send lspci and dmesg output
to this list and/or davej@codemonkey.org.uk
