I think this is a misunderstanding. My TPM is working just fine but the
guy I was replying to seems to have some problems.
The old tpm driver (version 2.0) distributed seperately at
  
http://www.research.ibm.com/gsal/tcpa/TPM-2.0.tar.gz
did not work for me though. I did not find an obvious problem in it but
noticed there is the tpmdd project on SourceForge and got the driver
from there. That driver is working just fine for me.

Still trying to get a grip on git to track the latest kernel and test
the TPM driver in there. Anyway, the driver I have is working fine. :)
(I am working with an IBM ThinkPad R51 if you care about it).
