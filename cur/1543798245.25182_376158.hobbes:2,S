Yeah, like that matters in the face of the overhead to queue
the message, get to the head of the SPI transfer queue, go
through that queue, then finally wake up the task that was
synchronously blocking in write_then_read().  Oh, and since
that's inlined, GCC may be re-using existing state...
If folk want an "it looks simple" convenient/friendly API,
there is always a price to pay.  In this case, that cost is
dwarfed by the mere fact that they're using a synchronous
model to access shared resources (the SPI controller).

As I said:  so the _typical_ case doesn't hit the heap.   There are
inherent overheads for such RPC-style calls.  But there's also no
point in gratuitously increasing them.
