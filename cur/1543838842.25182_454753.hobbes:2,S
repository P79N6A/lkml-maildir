When I discussed this with Hugh Dickins on summit we agreed
that +4 bytes on page struct for kernel using accounting
are ok and almost unavoidable.
it can be stored not on the struct page, but in this
case you need to introduce some kind of hash to lookup ub
quickly from page, which is slower for accounting-enabled kernels.

slab doesn't use this pointer on the page.
It is used for pages allocated by buddy
alocator implicitly (e.g. LDT pages, page tables, ...).
