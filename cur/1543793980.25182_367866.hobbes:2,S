Yes, same HD, same notebook, no hardware changes.

Ok - this was on a different computer, so it's not really related, but
the important point is that fsck didn't report any errors so the
write into the middle of another file was not caused by a bad
filesystem.

No ide errors at all in the kernel logs, which cover more than one
month.

ASUS M2400N with a SAMSUNG MP0804H 80GB hard drive (this is not
the original hard drive - the notbook was delivered with a 60GB
drive). Centrino chipset, 1.6GHz Pentium M. Hard drive running in udma5
mode. 512MB RAM, Intel Pro Wireless 2100 replaced with an Intel Pro
Wireless 2200 wireless lan card, and a CardMan 4000 card reader in the
pccard slot - not that I think these have any influence on the hard drive,
but this is the complete hardware description.
