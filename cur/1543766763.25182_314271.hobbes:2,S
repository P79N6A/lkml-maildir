Our point is that contemporary microprocessors cannot electrically do what
you want them to do!
Now, conceeeeeeiveably the kernel could keep track of the state of the
pages down to the byte level, and could keep track of all COWed pages and
could look at faulting addresses at the byte level and could copy sub-page
ranges by hand from one process's address space into another process's
after I/O completion.  I don't think we want to do that.
Methinks your specification is busted.
