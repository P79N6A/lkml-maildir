Yup, learn hints by heart ;-).

I somehow managed to go through 2.5 without any recovering
(even doing ATA and block layer development), call me lucky ;-).
Few hints on running 2.5 on production machine:
- don't run every new kernel revision, wait for some time and read lkml
  (if there are any problems noticed)
- even better wait for next revision and read changelog,
  decide if you can apply now previous revision
- don't run default IDE, get 2.4 IDE patch
- be careful, double thinking mode on :-)
