device-to-device is not the same as disk-to-disk. A better example would
be a streaming file server. Slowly the pci bus becomes a bottleneck, why
would you want to move the data twice over the pci bus if once is enough
and the data very likely not needed afterwards? Sure you can use a more
expensive 64bit/60MHz bus, but why should you if the 32bit/30MHz bus is
theoretically fast enough for your application?
So I'm not advising it as "the ultimate thing", but I don't understand,
why it shouldn't happen.
bye, Roman
