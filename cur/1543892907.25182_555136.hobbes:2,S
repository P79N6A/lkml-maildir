Might be surprising (or revolting?)... but, yes, I do.
.defaults reflects the developers opinion on the way of data
accumululation that might make most sense in most cases.
The current implementation of lib/statistic.c allows users to change
setting that we see in .defaults. If one needs to track more than
4 contention points, for example, then they can change this limit by
passing "entries=4" to the user interface. So there is some parsing
code anyway. Passing default setting in a similar fashion has just been
convenient for the developer.
