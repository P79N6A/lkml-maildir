not that i disagree with you ... but i'm sure that there is probably good 
reason for the memory map being set up the way it currently is.
dare i suggest it, but how about talking to this commercial-vendor and 
explaining to them that they need to use a different malloc.
alternately, glibc's malloc could be made more intelligent.

it is typically the case that programs that are designed to use large 
amounts of RAM are already using mmap(), so the problem doesn't typically 
exist . . .
