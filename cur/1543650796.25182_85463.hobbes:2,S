Actually, ext3 has been immune from most of the lock breakups in 2.5. 
ext2 used to have a lot of problems with BKL contention resulting from 
ext2_get_block() and some other assorted functions.  Al Viro cleaned
these up in early 2.5, but ext3 never got the cleanup.  It still scales
horribly, even 2.5.45.
