And equally importantly, why is it even in the stable queue if it's not 
upstream.
It's against stable rules, and it means that we may have stuff that gets 
fixed in -stable and not in -upstream, if people don't notice. THAT IS 
BAD!
Having fixes in stable that don't exist in upstream make -stable be 
worse than pointless - it means that we actively _lose_ bug-reports. It 
may sound like a good idea in the short run, but it's a *horrible* thing 
for the long run.
IOW, this should not be on the table for -stable, and people involved 
should have made sure it's in -upstream first!
And no, I do not think it's languishing in my mailqueue. I'm pretty sure 
it's languishing somewhere else.
