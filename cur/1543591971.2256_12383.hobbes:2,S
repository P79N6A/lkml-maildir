Why not name consistently with the struct block_device?
I.e.:
struct char_device {
         struct list_head        cd_hash;
         atomic_t                cd_count;
         dev_t                   cd_dev;
         atomic_t                cd_openers;
         struct semaphore        cd_sem;
};

You could then use an (perhaps even unnamed if we require a high enough gcc 
version) union in the inode structure so you don't waste space having a 
pointer to both c_dev and b_dev, such as:
         union {
                 struct block_device     *i_bdev;
                 struct char_device      *i_cdev;
         };
It isn't possible that both i_bdev and i_cdev are used at the same time, is 
it? If it was my suggestion is obviously bogus...
Any reasons why my proposal would be a bad idea?
Just IMVHO.
Best regards,
Anton
