  I may be getting an opportunity in the next weeks/months to play with
  a 16-way SparcCenter 2000 w/ 85mhz procs and 3GB of ram.  I realize
  this machine is rather pokey but I was wondering if it might be useful
  to help test the kernel with a large number of processors.  So, if you
  or anyone else have some test you'd like me to run (assuming I get the
  machine all set up and running Linux) let me know and I'd be happy to
  try some things.
