I think the thing that makes most sense is:
#define jiffies	((unsigned long) jiffies_64)
and fix the few drivers that use `jiffies' as a local variable.
No-one should be trying to write to jiffies, and the compiler will do
the right thing for reads of jiffies on 32-bit platforms (it does on
ppc32 at least).
Paul.
