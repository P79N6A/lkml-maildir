   With the appletalk code in 2.3.51, I can no longer use
   netatalk. Both getzones and papstatus try to bind to
   apparently the all zero address and get EADDRINUSE
Well, I did give people nearly a month to find bugs like
this when I made a call for testers way back then.  Good
thing I just put it in, because this aparently made people
unlazy enough to test the changes and report problems :-)
This patch should fix the EADDRINUSE problem:
