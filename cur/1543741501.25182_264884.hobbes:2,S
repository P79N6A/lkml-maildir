We'll have to be sure to include a way to access that information.

And that is the POINT here.  The question isn't whether or not we can 
become a charity and give away all of our IP.  The question is whether 
or not it's possible to sell open-source-friendly products.  Designing 
and manufacturing hardware is EXPENSIVE.  Especially at the volumes I 
expect.

What you're asking for is excessive.  Even Stallman agrees that people 
should be able to profit from their work.  Opening the source to this 
chip would be good for you and for every other company that wants to 
copy it, but it would not be good for Tech Source.  Tech Source is a 
business with a profit motive.  Will will not engage in something that 
costs us more money than it makes or diverts us from something more 
profitable.
You're allowing your lofty free software ideals to get in the way of 
what is reasonable and practical.  I believe in freedom, which is why I 
started this project.  But make no mistake in thinking that I'm trying 
to waste the time and money of my employer.
The only thing you need to make this product work is the software 
information necessary to communicate with it.  Hardware is not free, and 
it never will be.  Software, on the other hand, is trivially easy to 
copy.  So let's let the software be free.
Also do not make the mistake of believing that software is free to 
PRODUCE.  If it were, then free software fans wouldn't love the GPL 
which protects their investment of time from being ripped off by greedy 
companies that would like to steal their work.  Tech Source would have 
to factor my time to develop software for this product into the final 
price that you pay for the hardware.  The advantage you have is that the 
software, being open source, is guaranteed to outlive you, me, and 
everyone else.

If you only have one FPGA on the board, then you have a chicken and egg 
problem.  It's programmed through JTAG which turns the entire chip into 
a giant shift register.  The moment you start programming it, all 
variable logic stops working.

Xilinx already supplies free tools, and they also supply instructions 
for getting their tools to work with WINE.

As I've said before, if people want to give us a design, we'll 
manufacture it!

Different chips do things in different ways.  I guarantee you that my 
video controller design will be quite alien to you.  It'll also be one 
of the most programmable you've ever encountered.

If you participate in a project that produces something that I can put 
into a chip, let me know.
