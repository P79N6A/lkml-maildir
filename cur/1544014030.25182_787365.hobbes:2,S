I talked to David about this today (as I wrote in 0/6). 
Based on that discussion we got to the conclusion we have incompatible
requirements. He needs priorities to be honored (which means rather out
of order execution of the tasks) while I need strict ordering (for the
synchronization). While it's not entirely impossible to combine those
two into one system, the resulting complexity isn't really worth it yet.
Of the 307 lines, only 100 are actual thread pool code (the rest is
synchronization and admin code), and about half of those 100 lines are
comments.
