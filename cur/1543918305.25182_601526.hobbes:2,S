Yes, it's still there as of 23-rc8-git5, the latest source I've built on 
this machine. If you start menuconfig and search for the value, (I used 
"/APM") you will see that it now depends on various other options. I 
haven't personally needed it in a long time, but there are ACPI 
implementations which are seriously broken. And probably some embedded 
hardware and/or hand-held devices now.
