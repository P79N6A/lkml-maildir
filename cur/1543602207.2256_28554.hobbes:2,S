Hi,
I'm composing a list of all existing binary only modules, 
and I got to a list of 26 different modules; I undoubtedly forgot a few, 
so I hereby request feedback from people who know about modules I
left out, so that I can complete the list. (I do not really care about
modules that once existed for 2.0 or earlier and no longer exist for all
intents and purposes)
Greetings,
