In the case at hand we have mWh and mAh, which measure different
physical quantities. You can't convert between them unless you have
intimate knowledge of the battery's chemistry and condition, which we
don't.
And it would be nice to also allow for power supply devices that use
other, incompatible units like "percent" or "minutes" or "hand crank
revolutions".
