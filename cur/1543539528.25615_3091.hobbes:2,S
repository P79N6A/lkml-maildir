Hi Karen,
Thanks for your detail advice.  I have certain points expected to clarify;

>                                   /* This is really not necessary, but
wise */
Boot direct from CDRom therefore no boot disk created.
> cd /usr/src/linux-2.x.x
> cp -pf System.map /boot/System.map-2.x.x-y.y
Could not find System.map under linux-2.2.14-50.  Is it in another location.

Is there an easy way to make "ntfs" work without going through the whole
procedure, config, recompile, etc.
How to check which option has already been selected in Y/<*> or <M> without
going through "make menuconfig"
Could you please shed me some light.  Thanks in advance.
Stephen
