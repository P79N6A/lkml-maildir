I really think this or the previous tree is buggy.
Trying to start any 3D client just hangs my Evo laptop hard. It's a Radeon 
Mobility 7500 behind a ICH4 southbridge, so standard Intel AGP, and not 
anything very usual gfx-chipwise either.
I don't have netconsole or anything, so I'm mixxing any potential oops, 
and I guess I should try that next, but not today. I'm hoping this is 
something obvious and/or already known, since my setup certainly isn't 
unusual.
