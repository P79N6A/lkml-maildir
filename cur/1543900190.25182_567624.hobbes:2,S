SLUB using high orders without page allocation failures do depend on
two very questionable patches that I brought to attention in my inital
merge mail. If grouping pages by mobility goes through, I'll be revisiting
that properly to make sure it can work without deadlocking ever under any
circumstances. Right now, it theoritically could livelock although I've
never been able to reproduce it.
The patches as they are will work for high-order allocations if you are
willing to wait and reclaim memory. The more stressful users need more
effort but it's already been shown that it can be made work with one
approach as the last few months in -mm have shown.

And I want to avoid a catch-22 here where the features that depend on
grouping pages by mobility have to exist before grouping pages by
mobility is pushed through.
I would like the patches to go through on the grounds that higher order
allocations can succeed. However, I am also happy to say that order-0
pages should be used as much as possible, that case should always be
made as fast as possible and the world must not end if a high-order
allocation fails.
