In case of other error - no, we do not want to retry. Only in case of
-EIO because we just might have hit a new badblock, which is unlikely,
but possible.
If it is anything else then -EIO, then we just return an error and
_refuse_ to attach this MTD device. In this case it does not matter
where we add new_seb. We just drop it. We free all allocated data
structures.

If we hit -EIO more then five times, there is probably something _really
bad_ with this MTD device and we _refuse_ attaching it. We return error,
and every data structure is freed. It does not matter if we add new_seb
anywhere or not. It is anyway just freed.
