I've bent your code up a bit.  I've not yet been tempted to replace
any of it with a knob ;-)  There is a little piece I'd like to see
thrown away though.. the loop in refill_inactive does nothing good.
The test I prefer is a good one for the area of vm performance I'm
most interested in.  It doesn't cover the full vm spectrum by any
means.  I don't have a setup (any) good for testing mondo network or
IO stuff.  I test a simple 'job one size to large' scenario.  Yes,
it's limited test coverage.. it's still legitimate.
Perhaps when you're evaluating vm performance, you should try my
simple test once in a while. :) I'll bet you a bogobeer right here
and now that when 2.4.5 hits the street you're going to be queried
by the big-busy-box folks wrt swap volume.

I disagree with that.  I've seen a heavily swapping box run like
a scaulded ass ape many times.
