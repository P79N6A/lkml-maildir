Oleg, I'm responding to all your messages mostly in chronological order.  I
have seen the later ones with new code and ideas.  But I like to follow up
each point so we continue to double-check each other's logic and rationale.
Here we're talking about the first drop of siglock in handle_stop_signal,
where it calls do_notify_parent_cldstop with CLD_STOPPED.

Here you mean testing that the main thread got into TASK_STOPPED (and could
be so seen via /proc) while the group stop was still in progress but the
second thread running that read+assert has not stopped yet.  Before
dropping the siglock, we abort the group stop in progress.  So the second
thread never stops, and runs before the SIGCONT handler.  What /proc
reports about individual threads is not something I'm trying to make
guarantees about.  But I see there is a problem there because
wait_task_stopped checks group_stop_count and not SIGNAL_STOP_STOPPED,
so it would report the process as stopped to WUNTRACED wait.

I don't think this is really a problem.  This just means the SIGCONT is
effectively "after" the new signal, and the SIGCONT clears it rather than
vice versa.

This is indeed a problem.

Indeed then p->signal will be null and so we'll send no signal.
So no go.  (No loss, we didn't like this road much anyway.)

Sure, so why != CLD_CONTINUED then.

Quite so.

I think "stopped and then continued" means do exactly what would happen if
you really finished stopping and then continued without this race hitting.
If you did that and the parent had SIGCHLD blocked the whole time, then
waits two minutes, and then unblocks or sigwaits to get the siginfo_t, the
parent would see only CLD_STOPPED.  (This is because SIGCHLD doesn't queue
and the first siginfo_t pending wins.)  The other non-racy scenario that
could be is that the stop signal never got delivered at all before the
SIGCONT cleared it, when there would be no SIGCHLDs at all.  As I said
before, I exclude that version of events from being what we represent to
userland as having happened because the syscall-interruption effects on some
threads may already have happened, and give the lie to this story.  There is
only one story consistent with some sequence of events as specified in
POSIX, that explains all the possible userland-visible ramifications of this
particular internal race scenario.  Seeing a CLD_CONTINUED without a
preceding CLD_STOPPED is a new sequence for userland that was never possible
before.  In an application following POSIX there is no scenario possible
under the specification in which it could observe that sequence of events.
(Except that last one is probably not really true because I suspect it's
unspecified or implementation-defined whether when a non-queued signal is
posted twice, the first or second siginfo_t survives.)  That is my pedantic
rationale.  (Are you sorry you were curious? ;-)
Thanks,
