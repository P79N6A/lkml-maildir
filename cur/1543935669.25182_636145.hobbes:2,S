So, you suggested to load policy before mount() request so that
this filesystem can prevent attackers from doing something malicious
by minimizing (i.e. implement as non-blocking operation) the latency
between the userland process's call of mount() and the nodes become visible
to userland process.
I didn't take such cases into account.
My assumed usage of this filesystem is that run a script with
 #!/bin/sh
 mount -t syaoran -o accept=/etc/ccs/syaoran.conf none /dev
 exec /sbin/init "$@"
by passing "init=/path/to/this/script" to the kernel command line
so that /sbin/init can create /dev/initlog on this filesystem.
If you mount this filesystem after /sbin/init starts,
it will shadow /dev/initctl opened by /sbin/init .

I assume that being able to reach this location means the caller of mount() is root.
But, the patches to allow mount() by non-root is in progress?

May be I should add some sanity checking on the path.
Thank you.
