That's a good question
current->mm->mmap_sem being calculated once is a win in itself, because 
current access is not cheap.
It also does the memory access to go through part of the chain in advance, 
before its use. It does a prefetch() equivalent for free : If current->mm is 
not in CPU cache, CPU wont stall because next instructions dont depend on it.
This means less CPU stall in case current->mm is not in CPU cache. Thats 
difficult to benchmark it, but you can trust me.
A flag means :
if (flag)
     up_read(&current->mm->mmap_sem)
This generates quite a bad code.
if (ptr)
    up_read(ptr)
generates *much* better code.
So this is a cleanup and a runtime optimization.
I dit a similar optimization on commit 163da958ba5282cbf85e8b3dc08e4f51f8b01c5e

If you check again, you'll see that address points to the start of the PAGE, 
not the real u32/u64 futex address. This checks the PAGE. We can use char, 
short, int, long, or char[PAGE_SIZE] as long as we know a futex cannot span 
two pages.

Previous code was doing offset++ wich means offset += 1;
I didnt want to hurt Hugh :)

Yes, in a future patch, in about one year :)

Yes, but I'm not sure it will improve readability.

I guess 'm' stands for 'mask' or 'masked' ?
