Hi!
What is the status of support of the VIA VT8233 Southbridge in the
recent kernel versions? When grepping through the sources I get
the VT8233 in a few places, but my system doesn't seem to recognize
it:
$ lspci -v

	Expansion ROM at <unassigned> [disabled] [size=64K]
	Capabilities: [60] Power Management version 1
	Capabilities: [44] AGP version 2.0
it is 2.4.9-ac7 with:
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_VIA82CXXX=y
The other thing is: are there any chances for Linux to support the AC97
codec built into VT8233?
regards and best wishes
