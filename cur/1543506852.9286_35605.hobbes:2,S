Zip disks come partitioned as the fourth partition to allow MacOS to access
them.  Your tools disc, if it has the MacOS software on it, should have two
partitions.  Changing a disc from partition 4 to partition 1 will break
compatibility with MacOS, but not with Windows NT or Windows 95.
I had my Zip drive set up as  /dev/zip -> /dev/sdd4 and, in the course of
dealing with the infamous click, I fdisked one disk with Windows 95's fdisk,
making it /dev/sdd1.  I tried using Linux's fdisk, cfdisk, and sfdisk to fix it.
Even Iomega's format (long and short) didn't fix it.  The way I finally return
the disk to partition 4 was to boot into Windows 95, used the latest IomegaWare
(downloadable from Iomega's web site) to create a boot (or system) disk on it.
