Eh, uh, of course. Now that I look at that code it becomes obvious.
find_first_bit() works on unsigned longs, not 64-bit quantities, so
find_first_bit((unsigned long *)&t, 64) isn't equivalent to finding the
lowest bit set in a 64-bit quantity.
Think of the memory layout of a 64-bit word:
LE:	low 32 bits | high 32 bits
BE:	high 32 bits | low 32 bits
Take a look at the start of include/asm-powerpc/bitops.h, and note how
bitops don't define the memory layout at all :)
So find_first_bit(&t, 64) on BE will give you the number of the first
bit of the 32-bit rotated quantity, ie. of ((t<<32) | (t>>32)).
The problem doesn't happen with highbit64 because fls64 was specifically
coded for this purpose.
You really need to keep xfs_lowbit64 defined as it was before, or, maybe
even better, define ffs64 in parallel to fls64.
