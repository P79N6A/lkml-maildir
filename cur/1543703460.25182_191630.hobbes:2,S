Those patches are no longer included in -mm kernels.

As you can probably guess, enabling the C1 disconnect bit should not cause 
system instability. Simply disabling the C1 disconnect bit is not a very good 
way of solving the problem. Thats why those earlier "fixes" are no longer 
included in the -mm tree.
Ross Dickson has been doing some good research here - it does seem to be a 
hardware/firmware related bug, the CPU acting too soon after coming out of a 
disconnect (not too sure on the details here, its a little over my head). The 
lockup bug (for me) only shows itself when I enable APIC/IO-APIC in my kernel 
configuration, the older XTPIC interrupt paths are slower and tend not to 
trigger this bug as much.
With Ross's patches, you can boot with an apic_tack argument. When this 
argument is "1" it will introduce a delay to get rid of the problem. When you 
use "2" it will only enable the delay when a lockup is predicted. For me, 
apic_tack=2 has solved the problem, with C1 disconnect on, and APIC/IO-APIC 
enabled.
There's one side effect that a few people have reported: The clock appears to 
skew, gains about 15 mins over the period of 4-5 days. I have experienced this 
too.
