Hello,
  I received the following error while booting 2.4.0-test7.
request_module[block-major-3] Root fs not mounted
VFS: cannot open root device "" or 03:06
Please append a correct "root = " boot option
Kernel panic: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on 03:06
My root partition is hda6, and I passed the root parameter to
loadlin...same result. 2.3.36 boots fine. Below is the output of
scripts/ver_linux . Maybe I have to upgrade some utils. Suggestions
welcome. I noticed that my depmod verision doesn't support the --F
option, however, it appears that my modules compiled fine.
PII, Dell Latitude 333MHz, 64MB RAM
