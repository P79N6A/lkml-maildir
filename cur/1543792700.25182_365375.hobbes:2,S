Subject: Reading BIOS information from a kernel driver

I am trying to read a string that the BIOS has placed into memory.
The BIOS placed the string into memory at real-mode address F000:FA00
(i.e. physical address FFA00h).
1. Is there a linear address which always contains this address
location?  i.e. if there is a spot where I can do:
char * mystring = (char *)0xMagicAddress;
2. If not, how do I map a linear address to this physical address so I
can read it?
I'm pretty sure that the string can be read, but I would prefer to know
exactly where the string is located before looking.  For example, the
following command finds the string:
dd if=/proc/kcore bs=1024 count=3000 | grep mystring
