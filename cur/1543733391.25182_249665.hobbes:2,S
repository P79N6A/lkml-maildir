4) You're exporting a filesystem mounted on a block device whose
   device minor number is dynamic and has changed at the last reboot,
   e.g. loopback mounts or SCSI.
5) The mapping of minor numbers is stable but you physically re-arranged
   the disks or SCSI cards and changed /etc/fstab correspondingly.
Before you say any more, yes this is broken and fixing it properly is
Hard.  This is why have the fsid export option.
