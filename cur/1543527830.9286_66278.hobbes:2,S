Hi Martin,
  for current matroxfb release I read through PCI docs and decided that
doing pci_enable_device() is right thing to do even for me. Unfortunately,
now I have problem how to find, which of VGA devices was primary and which
not.
  Is there some recommended solution for this task or should I return back 
to my old code, which thought that if device is not enabled, it is second 
head (and needs full initialization) and if it is enabled, it is primary 
head (initialized by BIOS and doing primary console)? I need this because 
of matroxfb cannot initialize all types of hardware around, so it 
initializes it only when it really needs.
                                    Thanks,
                                            Petr Vandrovec
