Companies that provide laptops to their employees tend to frown on the
users installing a bunch of stuff anyway.   If the company was buying the
laptop to run Linux it would be spec'd appropriately.
But the real crux of the argument here is not whether or not people should
ever use binary-only drivers, it's whether the open source kernel
developers should spend any time worrying about it or not.
Cheers,
