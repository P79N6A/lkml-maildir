In addition to thawing worker thread before kthread_stopping it, there
are minor changes required in worker threads, to check for
is_cpu_offline(bind_cpu) when they come out of refrigerator and jump to
wait_to_die if so (ex: softirq.c).
I guess you would need these changes before freezer-based hotplug is
merged, in which case Gautham can send those patches out first.
