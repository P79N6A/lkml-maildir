I see now that this does not eliminate root in any
real sense of the phrase.  It simply provides a more
secure method for creating SUID-root binaries for particular
tasks.
I see absolutely NO reason why we should stop with that.
This does rather make my suggestions extensions to what
is "required" by spec. I believe them to be reasonable
suggestions that should be carefully considered for inclusion.
Note that what I propose in no way breaks what I saw in the
referenced document, they just do not go far enough IMNSHO.
Plan big or be small. --me
