You might want to give my input patches a try. Although they unlikely to fix
the problem that you can't suspend they should correctly restore keyboard
and mouse (PS/2) on resume (both APM and new suspend methods supported)
and I am very interested in results.
The patches are at 
http://www.geocities.com/dt_or/input
 
They are against -test11 but I think will apply to 2.6.0-final.
