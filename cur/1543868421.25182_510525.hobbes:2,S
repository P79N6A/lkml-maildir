Good point. I will review the code and clean up stuff like this.
While we are on the point, could you please formulate your criteria of
when cond_resched() should be used.

I tried to layout the code like: top level functions first, low level
last. This is matter of taste, isn't it? I am reluctant to change this,
because it is big useless work (I'll need to change it everywhere in
UBI). But will do this with great delight if it annoys too many people
(you are the second so far).

No, initialization stage does not need any locking.
Thanks,
