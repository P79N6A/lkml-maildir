I saw similar behavior last time I tried to make an uncompressed root
fs that spanned five disks, (around 2.4.21-rc1), but I seem to
remember that it read disk 1, ignored disk 2, read disk 3, etc -
I.E. odd numbered disks were actually accessed.
I worked around the problem by making a _really_ minimal root fs that
fitted on a single disk, booting with that, then extracting everything
else I needed from a tar archive on another disk :-).
