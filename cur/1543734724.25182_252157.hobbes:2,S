Well, I argue that it wasn't that dumb - in this case it's meant to be a
generic mechanism usable by everything in the kernel or userspace that needs
authentication, authorisation, or crypto tokens. I use EXT3 rather than
ReiserFS, so it didn't become an issue.

key_struct? token? key_token?
Possibly ticket or principal, though they make it sound like it's specifically
for Kerberos, so perhaps not.
What I need is a thesaurus.
JamesM: any good suggestion as to a name?
