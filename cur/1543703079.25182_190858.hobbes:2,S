I'm getting similar messages from dmesg after upgrading to 2.6.1, too:
request_module: failed /sbin/modprobe -- n. error = 256
[drees@summit drees]$ /sbin/modprobe -V
module-init-tools version 3.0-pre5
[drees@summit drees]$
Running on Fedora Core 1 compiled with gcc 3.3.2.  Didn't see these with
2.6.0.
