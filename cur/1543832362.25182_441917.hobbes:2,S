You could very well be right (I don't know the details that well). But in 
that case the get/put_task_struct() in the PI code is not needed?
I think, however, it is needed because the task doing the (de)boosting 
gets a pointer to a task, enables preemption and drops all locks. It then 
uses the pointer. The task could have been deleted a long time ago if it 
wasn't used protected by get/put_task_struct().
This is an examble of why using reference counting in a RT system is a bad 
idea: Suddenly a highpriority task can end up doing the cleanup for low 
priority tasks.
The work should be defered to a low priority task. Using rcu is 
probably overkill because it also introduces other delays. A tasklet 
or a dedicated task would be better.
