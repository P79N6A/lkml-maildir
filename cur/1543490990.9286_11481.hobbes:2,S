As far as I know, even the CE revision is affected. VIA is absolutely silent
on the matter which just makes them look worse in my eyes. It seems that
anything DMA-ish, PCI or ISA, is flakey with any VIA chipset. It would be
nice if VIA would talk to us and we could fix up a workaround for the affected
boards other than the smallish one in the soundcode.
It worries me that AMD's K7 is going to have chipsets by VIA and I think ALI.
The amount of bugs in the VIA and ALI Super7 chipsets gave the K6-2 a bad
name even though the actual chip is quite dandy.
It is a sad state of affairs when an AMD K6-2/300 runs faster on a intel HX
chipset than a Super7 board, even with a 66mhz bus instead of 100mhz.
Cheers.. hope I didn't go too off topic. :(
