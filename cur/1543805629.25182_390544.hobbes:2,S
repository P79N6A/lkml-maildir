Personally, I'm more in favour of a proper reservation system.  mempools 
are pretty inefficient.  Reservations have useful properties, too -- one 
could reserve memory for a critical process to use, but allow the system 
to use that memory for easy to reclaim caches or to help with memory 
defragmentation (more free pages really helps the buddy allocator).

Which areas are the priorities for getting this functionality into?  
Networking over particular sockets?  A GFP_ flag would plug into the current 
network stack trivially, as sockets already have a field to store the memory 
allocation flags.
