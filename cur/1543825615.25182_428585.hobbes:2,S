FWIW, I've seen the very same thing. Resume/power-up with a cd/dvd that
has a media loaded can take _ages_ to get ready.

In reality it probably doesn't matter much, since everything will be
stalled until the queue is unfrozen anyways. Unless of course you have
several slow-to-resume devices so you would at least get some overlap.
But it would be nicer from a design view point.
