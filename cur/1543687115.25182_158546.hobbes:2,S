It was not.  Instead we have fadvise.  So it would be appropriate to change
applications such as rsync to optionally run
	posix_fadvise(fd, 0, -1, POSIX_FADV_DONTNEED)
against file descriptors just before closing them, so all the pagecache
gets thrown away.  (Well, most of the pagecache - dirty pages won't get
dropped - the app must fsync the files by hand first if it wants this)
This would be a useful addition to rsync and such applications - it is
stronger and more specific and safer than banging on the VM for a special
case.
But if you want to bang on the VM for a special case, run 2.6 and set
/proc/sys/vm/swappiness to zero during the rsync run.
