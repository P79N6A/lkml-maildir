This is a repeat bug report - originally to the input subsystem mailing list
and the module maintainer. I received no response and no indication there
was reception. I have updated the results for -test9. (the bug has existed
through the entire -test series) This bug does not exist in the 2.4 series.
I am using the 2.6.0-test9 kernel. I have loaded the
joydev/emu10k1-gp/sidewinder modules. The sidewinder driver, however,
appears to not work properly.
I have a Sidewinder Gamepad connected. I have also tested with my old Gravis
Gamepad. (analog)

I am not subscribed to the linux-kernel mailing list. (Kernel Traffic is
enough, thanks! :-D)
Thank you, in advance, for any help you can provide.
