None of the perl scripts looks complicated.
Obivious question is if the same functionality could be achived by a simple
c program.
In the tool chain we use small C utilities in favour of for example
perl scripts in several places.
I would like to see perl kept out of the short-list of required programs
for the main stream kernels.
If the prize to do this is to write one or two small c tools to klibc
then I'm willing to pay that.
