Sure. GPL with restrictions might work fine.

That I can't answer. I don't personally think that BSD/MIT is any better 
than GPL with restriction, and the real issue boils down to "what license 
do people want to work on". Since Peter so far has been one of the major 
developers, his opinion (regardless of _why_ he holds that opinion) 
matters more than most to me.
Of course, some people have said that _they_ would want to work on it only 
if it's GPL, but hey, the proof is in the pudding, and "A bird in the hand 
is worth two in the bush". In other words, talk is cheap, and code rules. 
Right now that means that hpa rules, methinks.
However, I also have to say that klibc is pretty late in the game, and as 
long as it doesn't add any direct value to the kernel build the whole 
thing ends up being pretty moot right now. It might be different if we 
actually had code that needed it (ie ACPI in user space or whatever).
