Caldera bought the hardware, rather than hiring me. Having said that at
the time the dual P90 board + processors was not exactly cheap. The board
btw is alive and well and currently owned by Dave Jones.
As far as the locking goes I invented the big kernel lock, but the basis of
that is all taken directly from "Unix systems for modern architectures"
by Schimmel which is required reading for anyone who cares about caches,
SMP and locking.
