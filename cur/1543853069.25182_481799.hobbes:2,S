Well, I would argue that part of the problem has to do with the use of 
device_may_wakeup.  It is tied to a sysfs API and therefore administrative 
in nature, but now you say it's also being used to record hardware quirks.

It would restore that behavior, and it would be silly way of doing so.  
There are better ways to prevent autostop without PM, such as making
ohci_rh_suspend() and ohci_rh_resume() depend on CONFIG_PM!
However it was always my intention that autostop should operate without
PM.  It's not only about saving power, it also is about reducing load on
system resources -- primarily DMA, although this may be a lot less severe
with OHCI than with UHCI.  Does OHCI do any DMA at all when no devices are
plugged in and the schedule is empty?
My quick impression from the spec is that it does not, in which case 
there is no point in keeping autostop when CONFIG_PM is off.
