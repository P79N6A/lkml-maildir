Subject: [PATCH] Fix dm-snapshot tutorial in Documentation

I've recently added this documentation, Alasdair gave some corrections, and here
are some further corrections on top of his work (partly style issue, partly a
technical error due to different past experience, partly a note which I've
added - i.e. transient snapshots are lighter).
