It would be easy to do with the debug registers on PPC but they're
supervisor level only.  Users have no need to profile their code, after
all.
A logic analyzer would be really handy here.  Dave, think you can swing
one? :)
I ended up using averages for my tests with the PPC when doing the MM
optimizations.  Wall-clock time tells you if you did a good thing or not,
but not what it was that you actually did :)
Any suggestions for a structure, Dave?
