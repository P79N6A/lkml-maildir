The issue is, how will "other/random" programs/applications affect 
performance of my application.
Complain I hear most is from our database folks, they tune stuff
and they are happy with their performance. And then, some one does 
a tar/cp/cpio/ftp/backup/compile on some random files on the system.
Suddenly, database performance drops. They want to see a system wide/
per-filesystem tunable on how much pagecache it takes up.
Andrew, does this make sense at all ?
Thanks,
Badari
