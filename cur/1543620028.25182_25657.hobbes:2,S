Comments pertaining to all three of wavelan, wavelan_cs, and netwave_cs:
* wv_splhi should really just be spin_lock_irqsave.  calling
spin_lock_irqsave with 'flags' from another function is non-portable. 
doing so to an inline function is just barely portable, and is
discouraged :)
* I still see a couple save_flags/restore_flags in there...
otherwise looks ok to me.
