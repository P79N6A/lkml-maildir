I have completely rewritten (and very well tested) versions of the amd
and piix pci ide drivers.
I'm now looking through 2.4.20-pre2-ac5 and your version of via82cxxx.c,
and all looks quite good to me, except for some of the indentation
changes which seem to make the code fit into 78 columns at the loss of
readability. Was the file run through indent?
I'm planning to adapt the amd and piix driver to the new framework for
IDE drivers and then send you a patch.
