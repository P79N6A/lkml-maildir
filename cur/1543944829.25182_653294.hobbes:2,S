Subject: Re: [RFC PATCH] feature-removal: add documentation for exported symbols going away

BTW:
Sorry and it's not your fault if my answer was a bit harsh.
Your patch forces a nonsense that until now only Andrew tried to enforce 
(which BTW made me avoiding him whenever possible and never looking at 
-mm anymore).
There's simply no point in treating the removal of exports differently
from the many other API breaks we have in each release.
