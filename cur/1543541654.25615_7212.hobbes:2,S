What has that got to do with short filenames?
There is a decision to be made: does renaming "foo" to "bar" rename
"foo:splat" to "bar:splat". It would do under NT; OTOH, this isn't NT, and
we cannot enforce this across all filesystems which may contain a
"foo:splat". I'd go with "foo" != "foo:splat". Keep the two distinct.
If the user really wants foo:* ==> bar:*, [s]he can type it.
James.
