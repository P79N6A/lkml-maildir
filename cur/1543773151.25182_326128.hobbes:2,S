As suggested by Denis Vlasenko <vda@ilport.com.ua> I disabled DMA for
harddisks (because I have ATA hds) in the BIOS, and now it works
flawlessly. No need for "no(l)apic". For the record, the drives are:
hda: WDC WD400BB-32BSA0, ATA DISK drive
hdb: HITACHI DVD-ROM GD-7500, ATAPI CD/DVD-ROM drive
hdc: ST340824A, ATA DISK drive
hdd: DVDRW IDE 16X, ATAPI CD/DVD-ROM drive
and an unused barracuda 160G on sda.
