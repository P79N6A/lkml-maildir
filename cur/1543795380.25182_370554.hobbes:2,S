Beware of errata - there's at leats one errata on Opteron which forces you
to choose between x4 (chipkill) ECC and scrubber.  One or the other, but
not both.  There are plenty of errata on the scrubber alone.  Worse, if my
(brain)memory is correct, without the scrubber, correctable errors are
corrected on the fly, but never written back to DRAM.
