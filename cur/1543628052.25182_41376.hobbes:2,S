Thanks for the info.
For now, I'm just kludging in a sleep(1) in insmod right after
the print, as a temporary fix for my particular needs.  Saves
me editing lots of source files, and it "works" for this particular
situation.

insmod is run by /etc/init.d/rcS, so it's kind of unavoidable.
But I'm happy with my little private kludge for now.
