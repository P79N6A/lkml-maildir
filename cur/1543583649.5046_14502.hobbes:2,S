ok, thank you. Now I understand (maybe) whats' going on. Linux treated
bits 22,23,24,25 but ignored 27 which it shouldn't have. Now, coupled with
the fact that the problematic box I have (Celeron) has that bit 27 set 
suggests that we ought to extend mult[] table appropriately. The values
for that Celeron do not match anything in the Table 14 so we have to
extend mult[] emprirically. (so I now come back to the idea of 4bit
representation of 'bus').
I will stop here/now but I will definitely come back to this interesting
problem in 24 hours. But if anyone fixes it before then, I won't cry :)
Of course, before sending anything I will make sure my patch works on
_all_ my machines without any exceptions.
Regards,
Tigran
