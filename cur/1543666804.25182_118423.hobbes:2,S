there is some misunderstanding about at least one of the exploits out
there; one of them will, when successful, make itself setuid-root....
result:
admin tries exploit, succeeds
admin updates kernel to fixed one
admin tries exploit, gets root again due to setuid-root and thinks the
kernel is not fixed
admin yells at $vendor for providing a broken fix
