(Quoting very sparsely but I think honestly -- I think the above is the
essence of what you were saying).
Actually it doesn't have to be that much of a problem if the config
stuff is laid out sensibly, as Ingo mentioned earlier. Those IPv6
options you don't want to see are likely to be all in an 'IPv6' submenu
of the networking stuff which nobody forces you to visit. Yet
'NFSv8.1' (*shudder*) would be elsewhere under networked file systems,
or some suboption of NFS, and you'd see it just fine.

Again, if you don't care about crypto then you're unlikely to be delving
in the crypto menus. Nobody forces you to go there. But when you look at
the greyed-out WEP option and you click on it and it tells you "You need
ARC4 for this. Do you want me to turn it on for you?" (or whatever), you
get what you wanted.
Really, if our config is set up in sensible submenus (as in general it
_is_), the "see everything" behaviour really isn't bad.
