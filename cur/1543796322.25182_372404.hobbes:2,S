In a discusson aroung the leapsecond and how to disable it (some folks 
don't want the time jump) it came to light that, for the most part, 
this is unused code.  It requires that time be kept in UST to be 
useful and, from what I can tell, most folks keep time in their local 
timezone, thus, effectively, disableing the usage of the leapsecond 
correction (ntp figures this out and just says "no").  Possibly it is 
time to ask if we should keep this in the kernel at all.
