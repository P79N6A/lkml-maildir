Does this mean it is the drives which are faulty, not the controller?
These drives are both new, so I suppose known problems might have been
fixed.  FWIW, they are reported by the kernel thusly:
  Vendor: ATA       Model: ST3160827AS       Rev: 3.03
  Type:   Direct-Access                      ANSI SCSI revision: 05
  Vendor: ATA       Model: ST3160827AS       Rev: 3.00
  Type:   Direct-Access                      ANSI SCSI revision: 05
