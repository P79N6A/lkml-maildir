Oops.  Looks like I managed to make a mistake in merging.  Here's a fixed
version:

I don't see this as a win.  I *could* do a big monolithic patch to change
all references to current->*id to macros, then change the macros in a
separate patch.  But then we'd be stuck with macros for all those
references forever, and they're not likely to change again any time soon.
I don't think we'd really want to have macros for all our structure
references on the off chance that someone might change it in the future.
