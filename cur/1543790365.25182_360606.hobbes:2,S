Not _without__loss__of__functionality__. Part of the functionality is
looking up the mount-point and other info about the filesystem, which is
no longer correct when subfilesystems are exposed.

I mean specifically the case of df and similar things. So far remote
filesystems generally return obviously invalid results so far. But when
they are made to return correct values for subfilesystem, these tools
need a way to find where those subfilesystems start.
