Providing the additional mask "instructions" shouldn't create any quagmire.
It's the using of them that is intrusive.
Initially, some intrusive work, such as you (Bill) did was needed to get
masks implanted.  But now it should be appropriate to simply provide the
alternative calls that can make certain code sequences more efficient,
and then if someone complains that their old code sequence is too slow
or uses too much stack, we can recommend alternative code sequences that
will work better for them.
Passing the buck, division of labour and all that ...
