Exactly.  I still want the ability to tune the system according to my
taste.  I've been thinking about this for some time, and I've specifically
tried to come up with nice tunables, completely ignoring if it is possible
now or not.
If individual pages could be classified as code (text segments), data,
file cache, and so on, I would specify costs to the paging of such pages
in or out.  This way I can make the system perfer to drop a file cache
page that has not been accessed for five minutes, over a program text page
that has not been acccessed for one hour (or much more).
This would be very useful, I think.  Would it be very hard to classify
pages like this (text/data/cache/...)?
Any reason why this is a bad idea?
