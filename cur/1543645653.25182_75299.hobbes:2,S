Vanilla would be CONFIG_SMP=y, is that what you have?  Otherwise please
disregard the post just above (which hasn't appeared on the list yet)
because spin_lock/unlock would be null, and the tests I suggested would
have no effect.
We would then be left with a *very* small number of candidates, which
we will test in accordance with the "what remains must be the truth"
principle.
