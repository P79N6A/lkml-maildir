Isn't really a hard work. Download the latest unstable kernel (2.3.x) series and compile it with a good bunch of resources, wait until it locks (could take some time, get a cup of coffee, make it work really hard processing informations) and grab some info for us. Remember to compile the kernel with the Magic SysReq Key on, when it lock, try to do an Ctrl+Alt+SysRq+P and grab the EIP, try to find something closer to the address in your Symbol.map. If it generates an Oops, use the ksymoops tool and send us the output with your kernel config file, also a good information about your system (processor, resources, daemons running on).
