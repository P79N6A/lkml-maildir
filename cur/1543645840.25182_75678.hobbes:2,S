Hi!
Sorry this mail is not directly kernel related but there are the most intelligent people.
I have some trouble with my dual box. Under high load the box crashes or has segfaults. I found out that the problem is cpu related. Cooling the cpu's with 5 fans lets the box be more or less stable!!
Today I found some interesting data:
sensors (from the lm_sensors package) gives me the following output:
root@hdg /home/hdg # sensors
as99127f-i2c-0-2d
Adapter: SMBus I801 adapter at e800
Algorithm: Non-I2C SMBus adapter
VCore 1:   +1.68 V  (min =  +4.08 V, max =  +4.08 V)
VCore 2:   +1.90 V  (min =  +4.08 V, max =  +4.08 V)
           ^^^^^^^
+3.3V:     +3.34 V  (min =  +2.97 V, max =  +3.63 V)
+5V:       +4.94 V  (min =  +4.50 V, max =  +5.48 V)
+12V:     +12.16 V  (min = +10.79 V, max = +13.11 V)
-12V:      -1.63 V  (min = -15.06 V, max = -12.32 V)
-5V:       -1.26 V  (min =  -5.48 V, max =  -4.50 V)
fan1:     4115 RPM  (min = 1500 RPM, div = 4)
fan2:     4440 RPM  (min = 1500 RPM, div = 4)
fan3:     4218 RPM  (min = 1500 RPM, div = 4)
temp1:       +34°C  (limit =  +60°C)
temp2:     +36.7°C  (limit =  +67°C, hysteresis =  +60°C)
temp3:     +18.7°C  (limit =  +60°C, hysteresis =  +50°C)
vid:      +1.650 V
alarms:
beep_enable:
          Sound alarm enabled
Notice the VCore 2 voltage! 
The installed cpu's are intel pIII Slot1 @ 600Mhz and have a core voltage of 1.70 V. The VCore 1 value seems to be right!
When I show the values in the system-bios it shows me only one core voltage (I don't know which cpu). And it says also 1.7 V.
And now to my question:
Does anybody know the pins of Vcore and gnd from the Slot1 specs so that I can take a measuring instrument and measure the core voltage?
Unfortunately I can't switch the core voltage in the system bios:-(
Thank you for the help
