Hmm... basically you want to trim the x86 instruction set to get closer 
to RISC mentality.  Interesting.  gcc may already do that to some extent 
by not using the really complex instructions.  If that is the case, 
dropping those instructions might give some room for testing some of its 
possible benefits.  I doubt restricting the registers used by some 
instructions would help... I've heard comments that the x86 is 
register-starved enough already.
Have fun,
