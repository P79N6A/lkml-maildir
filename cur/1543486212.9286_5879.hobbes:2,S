Hi all.
I'm still having that parport trouble. In 2.0.36 my old HP DJ660C works
fine, but in 2.2 (this first appears in 2.2.0pre-3ac1, as far i
remember...) and now, in 2.2.1, it doesn't work. I do the following
sequence to load my printer mods:
darkstar:~# modprobe -k parport
darkstar:~# modprobe -k parport_pc
darkstar:~# modprobe -k parport_probe
darkstar:~# cat /proc/parport/0/autoprobe
MODEL: Unknown device
MANUFACTURER: Unknown manufacturer
darkstar:~# modprobe -k lp
darkstar:~#_
and, in 2.0.36, just a modprobe -k lp.
in both, after this commands, i've type:
darkstar:~# cat test.ps | lpr
darkstar:~# lpc status
In 2.0.36 this is what i got:
lp:
  (snip)
  lp is ready and printing
and in 2.2.1:
lp:
(snip)
 waiting to lp to become ready (offline?)
is there something i have to do? Upgrade my lpr-utils? I don't think so...
it cames with my slack 3.6...
Another thing, that maybe can have something to do with this: my printer
port style is SPP.
And talkin' in bsd-lpr, where is the bsd include dir? I've try to recompile
my bsd-lpr utils, but it looks for bsd.h in /usr/include/bsd, but i can't
find this dir anymore. Maybe i need new lpr sources? If so, where i can
find it?
thanks in advance.
