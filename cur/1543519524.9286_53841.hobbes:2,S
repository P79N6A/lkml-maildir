Ok, I admit my e820 knowledge is not 400 hours but only 17 minutes that it
took me to produce the simple workaround/fix for my specific problem with
this specific Proliant/1600. So I trust you and defer to you to produce a
more complete solution.
David Parsons sent me a patch but it did not work "out-of-the-box" and I
did not have time to fix it (I am at work, you know ;)
I obviously look forward to see your+David's solution that works in all
cases.
Thank you,
