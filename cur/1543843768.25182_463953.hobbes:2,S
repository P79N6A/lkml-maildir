Hello list,
Using kernel 2.6.17.13 on an AMD M2 64x2, motherboard ABIT KN9-SLI. Chipset
on this board is an nForce 570 SLI MCP.
Today I bumped into this, after upgrading my BIOS to fix a boot issue that I
was having (sometimes it wouldn't go past the POST screen):
---
MP-BIOS Bug: 8254 timer not connected to IO-APIC
Kernel panic - not syncing: IO-APIC + timer doesn't work! Try using the 'noapic' 
 kernel parameter
---
Prior to the BIOS upgrade I didn't have this problem - the system booted 
fine with the IO-APIC enabled. 
Using apic=debug, I see this:
--- SNIP ---
ENABLING IO-APIC IRQs
Synchronizing Arb IDs.
..TIMER: vector=0x31 apic1=0 pin1=- apic2=-1 pin2=-1
..MP-BIOS bug: 8245 timer not connected to IO-APIC
...trying to set up timer (IRQ0) through the 8259A ...  failed.
...trying to set up timer as Virtual Wire IRQ ... failed.
...trying to set up tijmer as ExtINT IRQ... failed :(.
Kernel panic - not syncing: IO-APIC + timer doesn't work! try using the 'noapic' 
 kernel parameter
--- SNIP ---
Using noapic, the system boots. Is there any performance impact that might be
occurring when using noapic? Anything else I can try?
Thanks,
Jan
