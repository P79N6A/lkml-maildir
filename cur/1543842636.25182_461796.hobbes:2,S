Subject: [0/6] 'make headers_check' fixes for 2.6.18

Our implementation of 'make headers_check' is currently _extremely_
simple -- all it does is check that none of the exported header files
are trying to include other header files which aren't also exported.
Mostly, this happens when the unexported headers aren't actually needed
from the user-visible part of the file which includes them. The fix is 
usually to move the #include so that it sits inside the #ifdef __KERNEL__
where it's actually used. A few minor fixes follow, to fix 'make
headers_check' in 2.6.18 at least for selected architectures...
