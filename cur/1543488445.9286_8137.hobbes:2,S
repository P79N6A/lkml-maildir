There's one thing I do not understand: you have different packet sizes
to each hosts (potentialy), you can send partial packets somethimes,
etc. Checksums of what are you going to cache? Are you going to split
file into 256b chunks, compute checksums of that and if someone
requests 1025 bytes packet, take 4 checksums, combine them and add
single byte?
