Hi all. If it wouldn't be much trouble, please include version 0.91 of the
tulip driver in with the latest 2.3.x kernels. Many of the clones of this card
are not made by digital and the 0.89H beta driver currently in the kernel
either hangs indefinitely or waits a period of time before actually "turning
on". This problem usually occurs on a 100-BaseTx line, and we lack the
configurability because we have no computers running DOS or Windows. Version
0.91 of this card works perfectly well for us. Thank you.
