I'm afraid it would not help you directly because you would still need 
to maintain that code for s390 (seems to be a heavy GFP_DMA user)
and probably some other architectures (unless you can get these
maintainers to get rid of GFP_DMA too) With my plan it can be just ifdefed
and the ifdef not enabled on x86.
