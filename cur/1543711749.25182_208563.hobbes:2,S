Hello,
I have 2.6.3 with fully working 2.6.3 kernel (framebuffer and XFree 8.6).
Today I compiled 2.6.5-rc2 with a .config generated with make oldconfig. The 
old config was taken from that working 2.6.3.
2.6.5-rc2 boots but when framebuffer activates, the monitor is blank (I hear 
only noise of HDD). I can log in with blind typing. The XFree also starts (I 
recognize it, because I can also log in with blind typing). But the monitor 
is blank.
What may be wrong?
My box is a Power Mac G4, 2x1.25GHz with ATI Radeon 9000 Pro.
