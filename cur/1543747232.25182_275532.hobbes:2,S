Hello
Using 2.6.10-rc2-bk12 on a dual Xeon which serves files at a high rate
(>200 files/second), I noticed that when doing:
    ptr = dirname + strlen(dirname);
    dp = opendir(dirname);
    while ((dirp = readdir(dp)) != NULL)
    {
       if ((dirp->d_name[0] == '.') && ((dirp->d_name[1] == '\0') ||
           ((dirp->d_name[1] == '.') && (dirp->d_name[2] == '\0'))))
       {
          continue;
       }
       strcpy(ptr, dirp->d_name);
       if (unlink(dirname) == -1)
       {
          if (errno == ENOENT)
          {
             print some error
          }
       }
    }
That under higher load it happens that the unlink fails with ENOENT. And
this is true because the file was unlinked by a previous call. So it seems
that readdir() returns some file name that has already been removed.
This is not the only place, I have other code pathes where this also happens,
for example where I move the files away instead of unlinking.
This did not happen with 2.6.7 or any kernels before that. Filesystem is
ext3 without any extensions.
Is this a known problem? What can I do to resolve this?
Thanks,
Holger
