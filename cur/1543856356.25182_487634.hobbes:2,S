It seems that this may be occur on _all_ nvidia chipsets (of course I'm
talking about mainboard chips ;) )
Which harddisk types to you use (vendor an interface type)

I assume that a large number of users actually experience this error,..
but as it's so rare only few correctly identify it.
Most of them might think that its filesystem related or so.

Did you check this with an hex editor? I did it an while the errors were
restricted to one "region" of a file.... it was not so that that region
was completely corrupted but only some single bytes.
Actually it was that mostly one bit was wrong,..
