True, sysfs is a Linux only thing.
But you can write a user space library which uses sysfs or whatever
_that_ OS uses to represent an SDI spec-ed out picture.
So a user space program would call (uniformly across all OSs)
a libsdi library which will use whatever OS dependent way there is
to get the information (be it sysfs or ioctl).

Yes, but it would be the best of all the current ways there are
to do it.

I've never heard that.  Is this similar to the argument
"The sysfs tree would be too deep?"

For a reason: let user space do it, there is plenty of ways to
do it, some assisted by the kernel.

"You have an attribute larger than 4k?  What is it?"
As to SMP response/request is more than 4K/8K?  The largest
I'm aware of is 64 bytes.

Again, char devices for controlling are discouraged.  There are not enough

Here:
/* User space lock */
fd = open(smp_portal, ...);
write(fd, smp_req, smp_req_size);
read(fd, smp_resp, smp_resp_size);
close(fd);
/* User space unlock */
