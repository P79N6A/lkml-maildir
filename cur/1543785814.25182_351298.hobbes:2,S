Difficult to tell without more info. Can be a broken IDE disk or defective
ribbon.

You can do " readspeed </dev/hda | tr '\r' '\n' > log " with the readspeed
tool from there :
   
http://w.ods.org/tools/readspeed
Then you just have to graph $6 (kB/s) versus $1 (bytes read). There may
be other tools which do all this automatically though.
