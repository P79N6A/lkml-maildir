Your chronology is wrong there
The history was
	Berkeley OS lab gets closed
	Lots of people go to BSDI (but not all)
	386BSD 0.1 is released - almost uncompilable, needing an FPU but
		with patches a hacker could sort of make it work.
	Alan orders his 386 PC
	Linus released first Linux in vaguely usable form (again you needed some
		hair to build it)
	Alan's PC arrived
	Linux 0.12 needed no FPU, 386BSD needed an FPU
	I ran Linux cos I couldnt afford an FPU
The lawsuit was some time after this. About 0.96 if I remember
rightly - It and the legal view that the BSD advertising clause and GPL
were not compliant stopped us using the BSD stack although someone did
indeed do a BSD stack port to Linux (Matthias Urlich from memory).
Microsoft and the overchargning Unix vendors certainly created the climate for
Linux, but I think backlash is way inaccurate. Sadly it and "religion" are
becoming a little too accurate nowdays.
