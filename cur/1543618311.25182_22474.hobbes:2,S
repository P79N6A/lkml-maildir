Andi, the patch above begs two questions in my mind:
1. Why to bind to 0 (INADDR_ANY) explicitly? My patch does not bind
at all and expects connect() to bind automatically. It is how
userland works and it seems to work here as well.
2. What did you do to increase the number of unnamed devices?
You said the patch "should" work, did that mean you did not test it?
