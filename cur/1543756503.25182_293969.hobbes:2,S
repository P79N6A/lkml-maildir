this phenomenon is very weird.
Firstly, make sure that all relevant threads (including the soundcard
IRQ thread, jackd threads, jack client thread, etc.) have higher RT
priority than any other, latency-irrelevant threads in the system.
If everything looks OK on the priority-administration side, could you
enable wakeup-latency tracing via:
 CONFIG_WAKEUP_TIMING=y
 CONFIG_PREEMPT_TRACE=y
 # CONFIG_CRITICAL_PREEMPT_TIMING is not set
 # CONFIG_CRITICAL_IRQSOFF_TIMING is not set
 CONFIG_LATENCY_TIMING=y
 CONFIG_LATENCY_TRACE=y
It should look like this in the Kernel Hacking menu of menuconfig:
       [*] Wakeup latency timing
       [ ] Non-preemptible critical section latency timing
       [ ] Interrupts-off critical section latency timing
       [*]   Latency tracing
what is the longest wakeup latency the tracer shows? You can start the
measurement anew via:
	echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/preempt_max_latency
every new maximum-latency event will be logged by the kernel, and the
trace of the latest worst-case latency path can be found under
/proc/latency_trace.
(If the trace is very long then most of the time it's OK to just send
the first 25 and last 10 lines. Putting the trace up to a website is a
good solution too.)
it should not matter how 'greedy' wmcube is. Does it do alot of graphics
activity (perhaps 3D too?) - that could in theory cause hardware
latencies - the latency traces will tell.

the patch below should fix this. (also included in -38-06 and later
kernels.)
