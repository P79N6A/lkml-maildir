Having level ability will massively speed up epoll adoption. By the way, was
there a reason to go to edge in the first place?

This last option would retain the current ABI *and* semantics for unchanged
programs. I do wonder if there is a case where you'd want to run in mixed
mode, however. But if the code to support mixed operation is truly trivial,
I think we should not set policy from the kernel ('only do epoll in one
mode') and leave it up to userspace to discover if there is a use for this.
Anyhow, as a member of the kCowSay [1] association of userspace people
meddling in the affairs of kernel coders, I vote strongly for having level
triggered epoll on the kernel, with the ability to do mixed mode.

    userspace code to be trivial, so we should have a massively trivial

    userspace dwellers.
