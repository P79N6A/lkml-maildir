I seriously wanted to test this much earlier, but my main
appletalk machine is a SparcStation10, and none of the
more recent 2.3.x kernels did boot on that machine 8-)
The patch indeed fixes the problem, appletalk seems
to be usable on i586 UP with netatalk in a brief test, but 2.3.51 is
simply too unstable here to do much more on it 8-)
