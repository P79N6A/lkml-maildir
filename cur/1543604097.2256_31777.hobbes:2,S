That's what I see... the patch doesn't make things faster, it prevents the
system from failing due to user space code. If it was just a speed thing I
wouldn't feel strongly about getting it in production.
The other thing is that I don't buy "some people don't need it" when some
people can't run without it and no one yet has stated that it impaired the
function of their system.
Given that some systems are vulnerable to user code induced failuers
without the patch, and there are no reports that the patch causes problems
on any system, and it's optional in config anyway, why the resistance. The
"we know what you need" attitude belongs in that other o/s, not
Linux. Make it experimental, there are lots of other "use at your own
risk" options in config!
