It came up long before that.  I refer to the technique in a post dated
Nov 17, even though I can't find the original.

Initiated by a post from (iirc) Dean Gaudet, we found out that
gettimeofday was one particular system call in the Apache fast path that
couldn't be optimized well, or moved out of the fast path.  After a
couple of suggestions for improving things, Linus chimed in with the
magic page suggestion.
