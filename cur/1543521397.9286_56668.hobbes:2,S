Subject: value of /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_always_defrag changing due to masquerade traffic

Greetings,
I've noticed that when ip-traffic, to be masqueraded, is sent through my
firewall the value of /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_always_defrag changes up and
down. Both positive and negative values have been observed.
This is rather annoying since when the value occasionally hits 0 the
defrag option is disabled (at least for non-masqueraded traffic),
my firewall starts dropping fragments since there is no rule for them.
(In a normal case all packets are defragged before hitting the
firewall code)
Setting /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_always_defrag back to 1 temporary solves 
the problem until masq traffic changes it again.
A quick look in net/ipv4/ip_masq.c and ip_fw.c tells that probably
some of the sysctl_ip_always_defrag++ (or --) calls runs a bit
uncontrolled. But that's just a guess.
regards
