In this case it is:
register_lcd_device("foo", ...);
...
unregister_lcd_device("foo");
The name is guaranteed to be unique by sysfs design during the whole
device lifetime, and calling unregister_xxx() outside the lifetime brackets
is clearly an error.

I understand this, I see why it looks unusual. I'll fix this if it matters.
It'll be something like:
lcd_device = register_lcd_device ("foo", ...);
...
unregister_lcd_device (lcd_device);
However, this extra pointer will take some memory; not much of course.
