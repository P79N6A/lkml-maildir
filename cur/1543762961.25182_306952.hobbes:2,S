Add the following to ~/.asoundrc (or /etc/asound.conf for systemwise)
	pcm.softvol {
		type softvol
		slave.pcm {
			type hw
			card 0
			device 0
		}
		control {
			name "PCM Playback Volume"
			card 0
		}
	}
Then you can use the PCM "softvol", e.g.
	% aplay -Dsoftvol foo.wav
This will create "PCM" volume control if it doesn't exist, and do
volume attenuation in software.  If the control already exists (in the
driver), the software volume is skipped automatically.
The newly created volume can be saved/restored via alsactl.
In addition, you can override the ALSA default PCM by defining
~/.asound like:
	pcm.!default "softvol"
> dmix by default would be nice though :)
Yeah, in future version, they will be set as default, i.e. without
extra definition of ~/.asoundrc.
