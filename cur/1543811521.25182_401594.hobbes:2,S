Subject: [Patch 4/4] Tell GCC 4.1 to move unlikely() code to a separate section
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This patch is more controversial I assume; it offers the option 
to use the gcc 4.1 option to move unlikely() code to a separate section.
On the con side, this means that longer byte sequences are needed to jump
to this code, on the Pro side it means that the unlikely() code isn't sharing
icache cachelines and tlbs anymore.
