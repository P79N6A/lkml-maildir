Currently, we don't even have a way to explicitly drop page cache
for a file or filesystem except for umounting it. 
In the old buffer cache days, BLKFLSBUF would have done it, but
that's pretty much without any effect nowadays.
So maybe you want to add the ioctl as well.
It would be useful for doagnostics and benchmarking as well.
