Thank you for information.
I am using Linux from Scratch. NCURSES is part of the installation process. 
/usr/lib/libncurses.so is installed on the system. After analysing the 
problem I encountered that it has to be a link to /lib/libncurses.so.5 which 
is a link to libncurses.so.5.5.
The link in my /usr/lib was broken. After restoring it, build is working.
Thank you for help.
