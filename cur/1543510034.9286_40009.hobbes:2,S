Subject: lagging kernel behavior--very strange

I have these two machines, exactly the same in every aspect,
periphreals included.  HOWEVER, 1 works great, flawless, the
other-- has the problem described below:
When doing heavy network traffic, the machine starts to
crawl with a load avg of 1.0 -- the NIC is PCI, and works
great in the other machine.
When playing mpeg video in X it is unusually choppy and
brings the machine to a crawl much like the NIC.
This is a pentiumII-350, tons of ram, etc, etc-- SAME specs
as the other machine -exactly- which works fine.
I've tried troubleshooting hardware wise, e.g. removing
everything but the video card and checking the performance
when playing mpeg....the problem persists
I know this's a vague scenario but i'm open to -any- insight
at all.
Thanks,
