How is this? The handler saves/restores register values. The fact that
some interrupt occurred has no effect upon the contents of general
registers, only selectors (segments), EIP, ESP, and the return address
on the stack. If ECX was being destroyed, it was software that did it,
not some "machine". What kernel version destroys ECX upon NMI?
