Hi there,
strange things happen over here
When compiling the 2.2.2 for the second time cause sound was not satisfing the first time
(could hear beeps, I thought to be interupts or sth like that), so I decided to recompile
it this time with sound as modules, but I forgot to add the pcmcia stuff, so when I rebooted
the following things happened:
1. sound worked fine, although no modules are around (lsmod)
    (sound is autodetected somewhere in during booting (dmesg showed me this)
2. pcmcia was dead, so I copied the old modules/2.2.2/pcmcia to the new directory and
    started the pcmcia.
    sound got louder and the beeps were back!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I have just no clue what happens here, and how I can manage this (3weeks of Linux is just
not enough   :-)    )...
more info:  pcmcia is version 3.0.9
                   I played a wav file with play
someone gets what's the problem here
could you send the answers directly to my e-mail address,
I'm not on the kernel mailinglist anymore (200 mails a day are toooo much)
thanks alot in advance
remo
