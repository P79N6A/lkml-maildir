Subject: [RESEND][PATCH] 9p: fix rename return code
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/1/18/154

9p doesn't handle renames between directories -- however, we were returning
EPERM instead of EXDEV when we detected this case.
