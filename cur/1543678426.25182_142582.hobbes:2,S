Right. That is backwards compatibility for you.
algorithm 0: no encryption
algorithm 1: XOR
algorithm 2: DES
...
algorithm 16: AES
...
algorithm 18: CryptoAPI - select by name
Changing this, while at the same time remaining backwards compatible,
would only uglify the kernel, for no reason whatsoever.
And I am not breaking user space, if I can avoid it.
