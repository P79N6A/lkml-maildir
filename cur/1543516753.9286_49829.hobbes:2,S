The other unixes demand system clokc in utc. It would be trivial to do the
same as the other unixes, but I bet that you would not like that solution
(kernel overwriting clock with utc).
Please don't claim others do better, when, in fact, they don't.

The kernel very well can set the rtc (it updates it regularly), it just
will not set the hour and date (because it can't).

The system clock *is* updated by using date -s. You mean the RTC!

That would be a very nice solution for your problem. Why bloat the kernel
with a problem that could be solved that easily in userspace?

No, it can't, because it doesn't know the timezone. And learning that
would require a dataset of over one megabyte in the kernel (talk about
compression..)
Let's drop this topic, I think it's clear that this all is out of the
question.
