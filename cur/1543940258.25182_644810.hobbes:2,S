You're ahead of a surprising number of people, including me, if you

That'll save a huge amount of hassle. So long as you manage to get the 
right drivers included and the wrong drivers not included, you should be 
pretty much set.

Yeah, but they each may need different instructions, particularly if 
they're not mounting by label in general, or not mounting the root 
partition by label. That was the big hassle going the opposite direction. 
And the procedure is 4 lines to describe to somebody who knows how to 
build and install a new kernel for the distro, which is much shorter than 
the explanation of how you generally build and install a kernel. A real 
howto would have to explain where to get the distro's kernel sources and 
default configuration, for example.
