Ehrm, that's a good question actually... I moved the probing call up
into setup_local_APIC in that other big patch and put a check at the
start of the probing function, so that it is executed only once. No idea
why I did it so weird in this one.

Can you enable it later on at all? It failed for me when I tried,
because it didn't know which hardware to use. Had to pass the kernel
parameter to make the proc files do anything. Seems like it has to be
enable at boot to work at all.
And AFAICT we never unconditionally reserved a perfctr for the watchdog.

In 2.6.21 the nmi watchdog, if enabled, just reserved its perfctrs and
everything else had to deal with it. Since the cleanup, the watchdog
will release its perfctr when disabled, so another subsystem can grab
it. But that also means that that other subsystem must release it again
before you can reenable the watchdog.

I'll tell you, once I'm sure that I understood them correctly ;-)
