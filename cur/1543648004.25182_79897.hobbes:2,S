Some questions:
	- is there a public spec for this architecture?
	- are you going to be generating a 2.5 version of this so that
	  this feature can be added to the main kernel tree?
	- Why don't you use the existing kernel way of notifying
	  userspace of hotplug events, through /sbin/hotplug?
	- You create a lot of new ioctls, which is not nice.  You should
	  probably do what was done for the pci hotplug subsystem, and
	  create a ram based filesystem for this subsystem.  That way
	  you don't need to have a /dev node, and the userspace tools
	  become dirt simple.
thanks,
