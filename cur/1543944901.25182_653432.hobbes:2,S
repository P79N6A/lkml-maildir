The vendor sk98lin driver will continue it's happy life out of tree.
The version in 2.6.25 is ancient and unmaintained and only supports older
hardware. There are no outstanding issues with skge driver (sky2 is 
prone to hardware problems, but then so is vendor driver).
Unfortunately, removing sk98lin seems to be the only way to make die
hard users report problems. The last time we removed it, some user's of
old Genesis boards showed with issues, but those are now fixed.
Jeff has scheduled sk98lin for removal in 2.6.26. (and it will probably 
be gone from -mm before that).
