Martin,
   can you explain what local_irq_disable() in do_request in
drivers/ide/ide.c should guard against? There is dozen (all unless I 
missed something) of paths which do not local_irq_enable(), and neither 
does the caller...
And what you meant with (endless) loop in ide_do_request?
And where do_request() callers obtain channel lock so that do_request()
can release and reacquire it?
My problem is that fsck reliable dies between 79.6 and 81% of its
run - on UP machine with SMP kernel:
NMI detected lockup on CPU0 ...
Stack trace: do_request + 315/924
             do_ide_request

do_request+315 is clear_bit(IDE_BUSY, channel->active) at line 606.
The do_ide_request()'s loop
while (!test_and_set_bit(IDE_BUSY, ch->active)) {
  do_request(ch)
}
looks very suspicious to me - it will loop here until the end of world,
as there is nothing in queue, so do_request() will always exit
with IDE_BUSY cleared.
Next question is: with this stack trace, where you obtained ch->lock,
so that do_request() can do call to spin_unlock(ch->lock) ? It looks
to me like that I should get 'unlocking unlocked spinlock' with
appropriate debug.
What (probably) happened is that hardware finished request before 
spin_lock_irq(ch->lock) (at line 749) was executed, we quit with
IDE_BUSY cleared, and it was last thing we did... Maybe I should
go back to IDE-98?
                                            Thanks,
                                                Petr Vandrovec
