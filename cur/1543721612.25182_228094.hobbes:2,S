If you register it, yes it would.  Hm, what happens if you don't
register it...

You are wanting to prevent hotplug events for a subset of a subsystem's
devices, right?  You faked out the core by providing a fake subsystem.
How about just using the filter of the subsystem you really want these
entries to show up under?  Would that work?

Well, we never considered that you would want to nest subsystems in such
a wierd way :)
Anyway, take a look at the filter ability to see if that would work out
for you instead of having to create a new subsystem.
