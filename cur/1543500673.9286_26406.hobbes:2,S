Not really.  What is the main difference between a bundle and a couple
files in /usr/bin, /usr/man and /usr/lib ?  It's the fact that they are
explicitly together, rather than bound by some naming convention.
Now if you add user overrides, you suddenly have a nice self-contained
bundle plus something outside of it and which can only be found thanks to some
naming convention.  So this user override breaks the main idea of bundling.
It just shows that the one-to-one relationship of components in a bundle is
not what we want.  Probably works on single-user systems, but on anything
fancier, the limits become very quickly visible and you quickly end up
using the same kinds of conventions that you tried to get rid of by using
bundles.

Yes, that's what packaging systems like redhat are for.  I prefer a
more strongly connected packaging like NeXT's (or `stow' or `depot'),
but the point is just that forks don't provide a sufficient answer
and that there is no reason to have kernel support.

Of course.  I might receive those documents via email.

Use directories instead.  This will allow much easier access inside.
