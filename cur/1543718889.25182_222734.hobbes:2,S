Good one, at question though is again though is whether the very 
communalities warrant some realignment. We want to hook into the base 
schedulers and be the clearing house or umbrella to consolidate all the 
ideas, such as the well defined RCFS recently introduced together with 
Rik van Riel. PAGG is as stated a way of doing things outside the core 
kernel and hookable schedulers have been several times rejected at the 
lkml base.
One potential is to agree that the communalities are so few that it 
makes sense to continue with both approaches independently.
