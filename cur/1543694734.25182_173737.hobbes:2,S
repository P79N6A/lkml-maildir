yes, it's intentional, this ensures we refile a number of pages and that
we don't only roll the list, it won't loop forever since at the second
pass the referenced bit will be clear.
BTW, the above obviously correct patch was apparently due an half merge
error too, this is what my 2.4.22aa1 or alternatively 2.4.23pre6aa3
looks like in this area. This gets right the highmem case too, so that
we ensure to refile normal zone if the user is GFP_KERNEL and we don't
deactivate highmem unless it's worthwhile, and it has the bh-related
knwoledge, so over time it'd be better to merge these bits too.
thanks,
