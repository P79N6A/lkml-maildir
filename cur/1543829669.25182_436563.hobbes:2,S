Yes it is! Calm down, I didn't say it was GCC's fault!

And this is why it over optimized.  It was the fault of the inline
assembly author.  He/she gave it the wrong constraint and this was
the reason for GCC over optimizing.  If it didn't over optimize than
it would have worked.  But the bug is with the code and not GCC.

I never said it wasn't legal.
