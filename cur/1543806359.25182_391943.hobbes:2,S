hi,
   actually i'm running on a dual processor x86_64. with the problem i was 
having, i never got far enough to see the message you asked about. Steven 
Rostedt's suggestion to turn off NUMA worked and i am now able to boot. 
However, if I turn LATENCY_TRACING on, i get an immediate reboot after the 
kernel is uncompressed. this doesn't sound like the same problem you're 
having, though.
