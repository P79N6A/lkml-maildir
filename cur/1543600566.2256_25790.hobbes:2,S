Okay, I had it again today:

Kernel was 2.4.9ac9 with (new) AIC driver 6.2.1, compiled with "Maximum
Number of TCQ Commands per Device" set to 64. I was lucky since it's a RAID1
system (mirror disk is hda). Distro is SuSE 7.2 Professional, machine
K6-2/300 with 128 MB EDO RAM, FS is reiser 3.6.25. Average load is low, it's
a small smtp/imap/www system.
So I compiled the same kernel with the old AIC driver, and it works fine.
I should mention that it is a rather old PCI AHA-2940 Fast SCSI card with an
also older harddisk IBM 0662S12 (that's the whole SCSI chain).
My other machine (AIC-something U2W with Tandberg SLR (U2W) and SCSI CDR
(SE) attached, no HDDs) works fine with the new driver. I just guess when
saying that it seems to me that the driver developers were focused on
up-to-date cards but not the older ones.
