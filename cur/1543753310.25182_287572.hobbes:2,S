Because of the bandwidth it is not possible to do any sort of live
processing of any kind. The only thing the daemon can possibly do
is write large blocks of tracing info to disk as rapidly as possible.

There is no copying by the userspace daemon. All it does is open(),
then mmap(), and then it sleeps until it is woken up by the ltt
kernel subsystem. When that happens, it only does a write() on the
mmaped area, tells the ltt subsystem that it commited X number of
sub-buffers and goes back asleep. This is all zero-copy.
