Hey, Pavel, the socket on these Winmodems doesn't seem to fit the plug from my E1
line. Do you have an adaptor?
Seriously, most telephony hardware is multi-line (up to 4xE1 and 120 channels of
voice processing per card currently), approved in lots of countries, and generally
in a different class to a Winmodem. However, the DSP on the
DSP-but-no-microcontroller Winmodems is adequate for many reasonable low bit rate
vocoders (generally low bit rate == lots of DSP horse power needed for
compression). Their low price makes reprogramming them as single line vocoders
quite appealing.
