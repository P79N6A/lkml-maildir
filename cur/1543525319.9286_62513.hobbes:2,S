Thank you for your comment. 
Actually, I'm not a bigot and accept people for who they are. I've also
learned in life that running around insulting people never leads to positive
outcomes. The main intent of my post was concerned with treating others with
civility.
I've received a significant number of positive and thoughtful private emails
due to my original post. In retrospect, I should not have spoken my mind on
this matter. Each individual can draw their own conclusions about the
conduct of others and are free to /dev/null them or filter their mail or
just ignore them. Enough said, I won't be discussing this matter on this
list in the future.
If you're interested in my "morals", I would suggest you read
Albert Einstein; The World as I See It; ISBN 0-805-0711-X 
The ideas found in there seem to resonate reasonably well with my view of
life.
Karen
