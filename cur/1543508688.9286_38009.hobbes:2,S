A lightly-tweaked 2.3.17 (devfs+mastodon build patch+silent a.out patch
+old-style patch+my latest tweaks to the memory detection code) of mine
doesn't seem to like to go to swap when pushed:
   the machine has 256m of memory, 128m of swap, and I'm using swapon
   2.8a.  When loaded down with bonnie -s 1024, physical memory fills
   up to the brim and the machine starts showing all the traditional
   out-of-memory behavior (long disk-access lock ups, mysterious freezes
   while the system searches for a free page, sudden large bursts of
   kswapd activity) while the 128m of swap remains blissfully recognised
   but untouched.
It's good to tell me that I possibly didn't break anything with the
new memory patch, but I suspect this isn't the ideal behavior.

   david parsons \bi/ rcp doesn't work, libc5 binaries don't work, dhcp
                  \/  doesn't work, cdrecord doesn't work, and now swap
		            doesn't work.  This is probably not my week.
