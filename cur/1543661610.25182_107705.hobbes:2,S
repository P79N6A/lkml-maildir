Hi David-
The only way we're able to do this on proliants is to use the *hack* 
closed-source HP kernel modules cpqasm and cpqevt. We then run their 30+ 
userspace daemons that monitor the system via these 2 kernel modules. Slap 
their hacked up ucd-snmpd on top of that and you get disk status 
monitoring via SNMP on the machine.
On a redhat machine, that's the following RPMs from HP:
cmafdtn
cmanic
cmastor
cmasvr
cpqhealth
ucd-snmp (from HP, of course)
It's a nasty mess, though, so if the cciss author had the time to put disk 
fail logging into the driver, that'd be amazingly cool.
