What about pushing the per-thread rss delta back into the global atomic
rss counter in each schedule()?
Pros:
This would take the task exiting problem into its stride as a matter of
course.
Single atomic read to get rss.
Cons:
would just be moving the atomic op somewhere else if we don't get
many page faults per schedule.
Not really nice dependancies.
Assumes schedule (not context switch) must occur somewhat regularly.
At present this is not true for SCHED_FIFO tasks.
Too nasty?
