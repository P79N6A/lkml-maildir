It is rather easy using ELF segments. You just do macros that put the
names and a pointer to the variable and the type into an ELF segment
starting with a known symbol. Then at kernel/module init you walk this
segment and do the necessary registration. 
[has also been done for sysctls]
Disadvantage is that one needs to change modutils for it to make it also
Also it needs new binutils; old binutils tend to mislink code with
the many inter section relocations generated by this technique.
