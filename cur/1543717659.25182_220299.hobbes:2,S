Unfortunately this is done in some places in DRM. Pointers are used as a 
simple 'handle' to point to areas that are to be mapped by mmap()
from user mode.
I've done some ioctl32() interfaces for DRM for a few drivers (mga, 
radeon, r128) to make 32bit software work on 64bit systems such as AMD64.
In most cases it was easy to work around the longs as they either did
not have to exist at all or could be replaced by something that's
platform independent.
I have plans to submit these ioctl32() interfaces to Mesa when I get
around to do it.
Anyway they are unnecessary kludges which should have been avoided
from the beginning.
Egbert.
