I think we agree on the abstraction thing.  I was more wondering what
you thought was so costly about an irq safe spinlock as opposed to an
ordinary one?  Is there something adding to this cost I don't know
about?  i.e. should we be thinking about something like RCU or phased
tree approach to walking the mapping lists?
