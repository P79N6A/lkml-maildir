That part looks OK to me, though I don't have time to test it just.
It's the change to "use kmalloc if we must".
I'd like to see you split that part out so it can be merged into the
next MM kernel.  (I don't know when that is, but I'd guess RSN.)

That part won't work right.  Remember, the spi_board_info setup
must be safe to call from arch_init() code; that support needs
to be statically linked.  The full patch for this would split
those parts into a separate file, and expose some internal hooks
to the module.  (Like maybe the struct boardinfo type, and the
board_list of instances, and the lock protecting that list.)
