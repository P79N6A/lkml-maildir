Will it be possible to select different access modes for different
images, something along the lines of the following pseudo lilo.conf
extract?
	image=/boot/vmlinuz
		label=linux
		access=in8G
	image=/boot/vmlinuz-2.2.10
		label=10
		access=in8G
	image=/boot/fd0
		label=fd0
		access=normal
		unsafe
Best wishes from Riley.
