IMO, it might well be the Linux/PPC PCI interface that doesn't return
expected values.
1) The [sym|ncr]53c8xx need to know about BAR addresses as physical
   address values as seen from the BUS. These values are used by the 
   SCSI SCRIPTS and _NOT_ by the CPU.
2) The pcidev structure returns cookies instead, that commonly are
   BARs physical addresses as seen from CPU.
The recent change in the Symbios driver about point (1) is that the
driver now reads the BARs using the pci_read_config*() interface. If these
functions donnot return the actual BAR values usable from the BUS for some
obscure reasons, this may explain your problem.
The cookies contained in the pcidev structure are completely useless for
the driver and probably for any driver. They just have to be used to remap
memory BARs to CPU virtual addresses. Then the driver forgets about them.
There are still some PPC PCI specific hacks in the sym53c8xx driver and it
has been reported to me that they can be removed. If the PPC PCI interface
is correct, then they should be removed without problems, IMO.
Here is a patch that removes the offending PPC PCI hacky area from the
driver (sym53c8xx_defs.h):
