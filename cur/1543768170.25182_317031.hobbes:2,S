	OK, actually - C with use of _syscall(); still, per-architecture
due to different calling conventions (mmap() has enough arguments to
trigger irregularities).  That deals with errno / __libc_errno getting
screwed, but there's more...
	v) phys_mappings rbtree gets screwed in fixrange_init() - no
surprise, seeing what it does in
        for ( ; (i < PTRS_PER_PGD) && (vaddr < end); pgd++, i++) {
                pmd = (pmd_t *)pgd;
                for (; (j < PTRS_PER_PMD) && (vaddr != end); pmd++, j++) {
Note that here PTR_PER_PGD and PTRS_PER_PMD are both 512.  Fun...  Liberal
stealing from arch/i386/mm/init.c deals with that one, AFAICS.  Now we have
the following:
	uml/i386 - all variants work
	uml/amd64 TT-only - panics in execve() on /sbin/init (hey, a progress)
	uml/amd64 other variants - work
Now to figure out WTF is happening in that execve()...
