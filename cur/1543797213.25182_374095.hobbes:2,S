The softmac code that is still in adm8211 is actually based on an early 
version of the softmac code that Jouni made for Devicescape. The Devicescape 
code does much more useful stuff than the code currently in the kernel. Sure, 
I can and have been porting adm8211 to the new kernel stuff.. but it already 
works with a much more mature piece of softmac code. I see the use of Intel's 
802.11 code as a step backwards.
