FWIW, I think that copy_to_user will work correctly since it keeps the mmap
semaphore for the duration of the copy.
Direct-io might have the same problem.

Since this is the receive side, the DMA can take an indefinite
time to arrive. Isnt this a problem if we keep the mmap_sem?

I'm actually reasonably happy with the trick that I'm using:
performing a second get_user_pages after DMA and comparing
the page lists.
However, doing this every time on the off chance that a
page was made COW forces me into task context, every time.
