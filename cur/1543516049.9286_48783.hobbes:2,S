   You mean you're still using 2k blocks? I use 4k blocks on filesystems
   larger than 4G. Noticably faster mount times and fsck times. (ok, it
   may be a bit less efficient, but larger than 4G means that i'm talking
   about larger disks..... And I'm spending at least 400M in "reserved
   for superuser", and chances are that I'm using less than 100k files on
   such a filesystem, so the block-size roundoff is also going to be less
   than 400M....)
8 meg block groups imply you're using 1k blocks.  32 meg block groups
imply you're using 4k blocks.  E2fsprogs 1.18 automatically creates
filesystems with 4k blocks when making large filesystems, but most folks
have filesystems created with earlier versions of e2fsprogs which used
1k blocks by default, and so there are many filesystems using 1k block
sizes out there.  That's why I said 8 megs or 32 megs.....
