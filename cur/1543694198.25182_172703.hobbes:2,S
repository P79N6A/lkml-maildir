Hi Florian!
I'm Cc'ing all the mailinglists in order to keep them posted about the
question you've raised there.  All further discussion will move to
netfilter-devel, so for those interested: Please continue there.

So It's clearly the connection tracking subsystem.  This is on one hand
good (because it means it's neither netfilter nor iptables).

On the other hand, this is definitely way worse than you would expect.
Can you please tell me more information about:
- number of connections you have? (cat /proc/net/ip_conntrack | wc -l)
- number of buckets and ip_conntrack_max (printed at ip_conntrack
  loadtime
- your traffic pattern.  Are you spraying udp packets with random
  src/dst? What kind of connections (protocol, application) are you
  testing with?
- what about the hardware (cpu, memory, smp?)
Even the worst tests we've had so far (random UDP packets) 'only'
reduced the througput by about 50%.   Maybe we can do better than 50%
worst case behaviour, but you will always observe a visible impact as
soon as you start connection tracking for every single packet (which is
what 'insmod ip_conntrack' implies).

Have you observed this behaviour with other kernel versions?  Was there
a performance change between 2.4 and 2.6?  Or did you always observe
this grave performance loss?
