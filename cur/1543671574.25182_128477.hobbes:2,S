I'm attempting to send SIGRTMIN to an entire pgrp composed of threads.
I'm running into issues with the management thread getting this signal and
dying because it is uncaught in that thread.  Is there any way to make the
management thread ignore this signal?  (and i'm running linux 2.4.20-ish
and glibc-2.2.4-19.3)
