If you look around the shortlog, you'll see I'm not the only person[1] with
these messages. I suspect mine was large because I pulled my linus branch
into my parisc branch, rather than vice versa. Linus explained to me that
these merge markers get created whenever a non-trivial merge occurs.
Not something to worry about, I believe.
