As I told you, you use sigaction(). Also flock() will not block
unless there is another open on the file. The code will run to
your blocking read(), wait 10 seconds, get your "timeout" from
the signal handler, then read() will return with -1 and ERESTARTSYS
in errno as required.
Also, using a 'C' runtime library call like write() in a signal-
handler is a bug.
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/time.h>
#include <sys/file.h>
#include <time.h>
#include <signal.h>
void alrm(int sig)
{
     write(2, "timeout\n", 8);
}
int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
     struct sigaction sa;
     struct itimerval tv = {
         .it_interval = {.tv_sec = 10, .tv_usec = 0},
         .it_value = {.tv_sec = 10, .tv_usec = 0},
     };
     struct itimerval otv;
     sigaction(SIGALRM, NULL, &sa);
     sa.sa_handler = alrm;
     sa.sa_flags = 0;
     sigaction(SIGALRM, &sa, NULL);
//    signal(SIGALRM, alrm);
     setitimer(ITIMER_REAL, &tv, &otv);
     int fd = open(argv[1], O_RDWR);
     if ( fd < 0 )
     {
         perror(argv[1]);
         return 1;
     }
     printf("locking...\n");
     if ( flock(fd, LOCK_EX) < 0 )
     {
         perror("flock");
         return 1;
     }
     printf("sleeping...\n");
     int ch;
     read(0, &ch, 1);
     close(fd);
     return 0;
}
