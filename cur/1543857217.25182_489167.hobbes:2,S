What's wrong with using atomic_cmpxchg? For unsigned long / pointers,
there is a patch to implement atomic_long_cmpxchg.
Some architectures simply can't implement cmpxchg on memory that may
be modified in arbitrary ways. If you add some more conditions to use
cmpxchg, then you weaken it (ie. can't use it for synchronisation
with userspace) and on top of that you don't get the easy static
checking that atomic_t gives you.
