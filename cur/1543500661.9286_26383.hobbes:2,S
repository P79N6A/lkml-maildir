This means that if it displays a CD-ROM or a automount directory it cannot be
umounted, which would be annoying. 
Hmm, a O_WEAK flag needed? This could be hard to fit into the existing
reference-count based VFS though.
Another alternative would a layer like supermount that allows umount with
active descriptors, but this would be a rather radical change from the
sysadmin level (more radical than the IRIX solution, which uses a daemon 
and some kernel hack)
