Maybe I can publish it tomorrow or something like that.

If we are to compress on a block basis, the bigger the block the higher the 
compression ratio we'll be able to achieve (using zlib, for instance). However, 
data sent to the actual block device will have to go in blocks itself.
For instance, if we compress a 32kB block and it only needs 8980 bytes to be 
stored, we need 18 512byte blocks to store it. On average, we will lose 1/2 of 
the actual block size per "upper level" block size bytes of data. In a 32kB/512 
byte ratio, we would lose on average 256 bytes per 32kb of data ~ 0.8% (which is 
more than acceptable).

Ok, we are definitely fighting different wars here.
Anyway, I'll try to gather what I did with the network block device server and 
place it somewhere where you can look at it. It will probably help you do some 
tests, too. Because it is a block device in "user space", it is much simpler to 
develop and test different approaches, and gather some results, before trying 
things inside the kernel.
If you want to start now, just go to:
http://nbd.sourceforge.net/
and download the source for the network block device server. My server is 
probably more complex than the original, because of all the metadata handling.
I hope this helps,
