I don't quite understand all these indirections.  What's the problem
with just having a helper that builds the scatterlist for you?

We allow dma access to arbitary pieces of _dynamically_ allocated kernel
memory, and I think using the crypto subsystem on the stack is not allowed
at all.
But the even bigger question is, how does this relate to rxrpc?

very odd line split, please put the function name on the same line
as the qualifiers, or everything including the void on a line of it's
own.  The first option seems to be the preffered style in this file.
