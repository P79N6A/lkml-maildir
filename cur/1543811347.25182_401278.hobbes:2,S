Ok, I did some reading and just started a git bisect. I didn't find hints on 
how to bisect if I'm only interested in changes to sky2.[ch], so I'm taking 
the full kernel tree and skip testing those bisect steps that didn't change 
sky2.[ch].
Looking at Carl-Danies 0.13a and Stephens patch against 0.15 in this thread, 
I'll patch each bisect step such that sky2_poll() has
       sky2_write32(hw, STAT_CTRL, SC_STAT_CLR_IRQ);
       if (sky2_read8(hw, STAT_LEV_TIMER_CTRL) == TIM_START) {
               sky2_write8(hw, STAT_LEV_TIMER_CTRL, TIM_STOP);
               sky2_write8(hw, STAT_LEV_TIMER_CTRL, TIM_START);
        }
after exit_loop. Is that ok?
I'll report as soon as I have results.
