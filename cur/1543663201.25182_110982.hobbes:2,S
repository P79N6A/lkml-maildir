Hello everybody,
We're running here a couple of 4-way intel boxes each with
6GB of memory and a SCSI RAID.  The sole purpose is to run
SAP applications (SAP app servers).  Basically, it's 30-40
processes accepting connections from ~150 SAP users and
making queries/updates to a DB server.  These processes are
long lived and may swallow quite a bit of memory.  The
standard estimate is ~30MB per user.
Currently, one box is running 2.4.20aa1 kernel and the other
2.4.20 with rmap15d and a bunch of NFS patches applied.
We're not entirely happy with either VM though the SAP
statistics show that both machines have acceptable response
times.
Both servers swap constantly, but the 2.4.20aa1 at a 10-fold
higher rate.  OTOH, there should be enough memory for
everything.  It seems like both VMs have preference for
cache.  Is it possible to reduce the amount of memory used
for cache?
The worst situation is when there's a high io load.  For
example, a file transfer over the Gb i/f (~40MBps) makes
almost all SAP processes stuck in the D state for some time
even making some SAP jobs fail due to high timeouts.  It
looks like the VM wants to fill the cache and starts to swap
more at the same time.  So we have to do big file transfers
when there's no SAP activity.  The machine also suffers
badly during backup.
Finally, there's a third SAP app server, an RS6000 running
AIX with the same amount of memory, which seems to be more
stable under various loads.
Anybody with advice on how to get Linux behave better?
I will paste here excerpts from vmstat and sysstat
(sar), which seemed to be representative, as well as other
relevant data.
Cheers!
Dejan
