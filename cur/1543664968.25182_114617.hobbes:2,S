i have a religious objection to clip.  ask me about lane :)  seriously
though i know there are a coulple problems with the clip driver:  xoff
handling is really quite 'strange' and there appears to a race with the
neighbor table handling w/ svcs.  i really just want to get things running
again (however poorly) on 2.5 before 'fixing' things.
