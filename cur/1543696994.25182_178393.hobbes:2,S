Christoph Hellwig once explained us why it was bad and basically what needed
to be done in comx to make it link. But I think that nobody uses this driver
nowadays or that its users blindly apply this patch. I myself once tried to
fix it because of this annoyance (although I don't use it), and found myself
duplicating lots of proc stuff so I concluded this was plain silly and that
the comx driver will simply be disabled in my later kernels.
Cheers,
Willy
