FYI, i've put the 'blocker device' kernel code into the current -RT
patch (-30-7). This makes it possible to build it on SMP (which didnt
work when it was a module), and generally makes it easier to do testing
via pi_test.
The only change needed on the userspace pi_test side was to add -O2 to
the CFLAGS in the Makefile to make the loop() timings equivalent, and to
remove the module compilations. I've added a .config option for it too
and cleaned up the code.
