Usually for me, the next step is to disassemble their object code for
symbol information using objdump.
You should be able to get some function names, variable names, etc.  from
that -- if those match the kernel code in question, that's about as good a
"smoking gun" as you can expect to find.  'strings' isn't as good for
function names.
As a final level of analysis, you can always look at the compiled binary
code -- if you think they are using a _reasonably_ compatible compiler, you
might actually be able to find long sections of identical or near-identical
assembly (modulo loop unrolling, etc. which you should be able to identify
by hand.)
