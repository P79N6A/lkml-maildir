I've done that in the past - it's easy to do - but nowadays, I tend to
wait for more facts before assuming - although I'm by no means perfect
in that regard...

Always possible, but I'd consider it unlikely that using the SAME
motherboard and drive, but with a different PSU would have any affect
whatsoever if such was the reason.
I would presume that the old PSU was just too noisy for that
particular drive, and a new PSU is rather quieter in that regard.

Unfortunately, none of that is relevant in my case...see below...

The system in question is my network printserver, which has a 386sx/16
processor and a very definitely 40 line cable with no support for
anything else. The hard drive is an antique Maxtor 800M one, and I
have no problem assuring you that it's not possible to buy that model
new, and hasn't been for some years now...
Best wishes from Riley.
