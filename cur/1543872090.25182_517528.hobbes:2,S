You avoid those two, but add the very high likelyhood that a statement of the
form 'if (!x) {....}' will creep back in and bug out.  I doubt that changing
the form of a basic C idiom to save a few cycles is worth it, especially when
the (!x) form can be tested without a memory fetch, but (x != nil) may require
fetching 'nil' (remember - the x86 is a very popular chipset, but register
starved - if the loop is any size at all, 'nil' may require a reload each
time around, costing you the win you thought you had....
