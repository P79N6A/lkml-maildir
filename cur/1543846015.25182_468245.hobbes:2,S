I don't think it matters if it's a bug in the unwinding code or in the 
data generated for it. It's still a bug in the unwinder.
Those bugs have been compiler bugs, manual annotation bugs, and it 
doesn't _matter_ what kind of bugs. The end result is the same: the 
unwinder is buggy.

I dispute the "clearly". We didn't have _that_ many problems with just 
manually filtering out obvious left-overs from some previous callchain.
I mean, really: Andi, point me to anything that was a real problem when we 
had no unwinder at all?
