So running ioctl(BLKFLSBUF) against the device will fix things up?
Perhaps not, and we should invalidate all the file data as well. The
only ways we have of doing that are umount+mount or /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches.
I'm not sure what is the best thing to do here - there are advantages to
caching the fact that the device (or some of it) is unreadable.
