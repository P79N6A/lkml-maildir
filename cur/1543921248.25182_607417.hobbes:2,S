And the same SATA controller could show up behind a different northbridge. 
It would be unfortunate to hit the same device bug independantly on each 
system and work around it by doing something that won't help the next 
user.

Have we gotten around to having a device quirk for this? I bet it won't be 
too long before we see a system where the SATA controller doesn't work 
with INTX disabled and the ethernet controller doesn't work with it 
enabled, since we've seen devices with each of these bugs.
