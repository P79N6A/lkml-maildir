This might be an acceptable patch.
Al? What do you think? Basically, it says that
 - the file owner can always set MTIME/ATIME, of course
 - non-owners can set it only when they have write permissions, and if it 
   was a file descriptor, the only way for us to know that they have write 
   permissions is if it's opened writably, which is hopefully equivalent 
   to that MAY_WRITE test (except the MAY_WRITE test was done at _open_ 
   time).
This would seem to be the minimal change, and I think it's right.
