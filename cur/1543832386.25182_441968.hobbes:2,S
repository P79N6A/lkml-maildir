We have 2 ide layers, 2 usb-storage drivers, 2 sound systems and we
have had 2 pcmcia subsystems and 2 usb subsystems.  At one point, it's
the only way to find out what will work out.  Suspend2 and uswsusp
have very different fundamental designs, and it's quite unclear at
that point which one is the right one.

The polarisation that is going on has resulted in nobody caring about
that, sadly enough.  And in any case it's absolutely demented that
non-disk drivers could have so much of an influence on the stability
of suspend-to-disk.
