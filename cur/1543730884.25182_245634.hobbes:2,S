Why? The question was what these plugins are exactly. This is the

Are you actually listening? If you implement a filesystem there's a
place where you have to implement the Linux VFS methods. I'm talking
about inode_operations and these things. This has nothing to do with
doing anything outside the Linux VFS. And I'm not talking about these
metas either. These really don't belong inside the filesystem.

See, you didn't listen. ;-)
The reiser4 core doesn't know about inodes, directories or files. It's
the glue code between the VFS and the storage layer that does. It's
implemented as a plugin. This has nothing to do with semantic
enhancements yet. These should be removed for now and made a 2.7 topic.
Maybe Namesys could provide them as an additional patch from their
webpage for those who need it. The plugins that would benefit from this
(encrypted and compressed file storage) aren't ready yet anyway.
