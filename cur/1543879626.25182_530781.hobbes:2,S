Not tried yet, it already looks better with the update and sched-fair-hog.
Now xterm open "instantly" even with 1000 running processes.

Good idea. The machine I'm typing from now has 1000 scheddos running at +19,
and 12 gears at nice 0. Top keeps reporting different cpu usages for all gears,
but I'm pretty sure that it's a top artifact now because the cumulated times
are roughly identical :

From time to time, one of the 12 aligned gears will quickly perform a full
quarter of round while others slowly turn by a few degrees. In fact, while
I don't know this process's CPU usage pattern, there's something useful in
it : it allows me to visually see when process accelerate/deceleraet. What
would be best would be just a clock requiring low X ressources and eating
vast amounts of CPU between movements. It will help visually monitor CPU
distribution without being too much impacted by X.
I've just added another 100 scheddos at nice 0, and the system is still
amazingly usable. I just tried exchanging a 1-byte token between 188 "dd"
processes which communicate through circular pipes. The context switch
rate is rather high but this has no impact on the rest :

Playing with the sched_max_hog_history_ns does not seem to change anything.
Maybe it's useful for other workloads. Anyway, I have nothing to complain
about, because it's not common for me to be able to normally type a mail on
a system with more than 1000 running processes ;-)
Also, mixed with this load, I have started injecting HTTP requests between
two local processes. The load is stable at 7700 req/s (11800 when alone),
and what I was interested in is the response time. It's perfectly stable
between 9.0 and 9.4 ms with a standard deviation of about 6.0 ms. Those were
varying a lot under stock scheduler, with some sessions sometimes pausing
for seconds. (RSDL fixed this though).
Well, I'll stop heating the room for now as I get out of ideas about how
to defeat it. I'm convinced. I'm impatient to read about Mike's feedback
with his workload which behaves strangely on RSDL. If it works OK here,
it will be the proof that heuristics should not be needed.
Congrats !
