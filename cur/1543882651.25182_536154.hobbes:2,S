There opportunities to enhance this code without writing it in C.
Such as building the code out comprehensible single of subroutines,
with a well defined calling sequence.
The big benefit when you can go to C is that you can include headers
from elsewhere in the kernel and since setup.S is increasingly
becoming optional it has a fixed interface to the rest of
the kernel, so there is much less opportunity for enhancement there.
