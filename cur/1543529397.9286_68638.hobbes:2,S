Hi All!
SCSI Symbios 53c876e Not working on Linux but working on NT.
Intel Server Board N440BX  
On Linux I have:
SCSI host 0 abort (pid 0) timed out - resetting
SCSI bus is being reset for host 0 channel 0.
ncr53c8xx_reset: pid=0 reset_flags=2 serial_number=5 serial_number_at_timeout=5
In /proc/interrupts 10 and 11 IRQ = 0 . (No interrupts)
I ges - IRQ wrong ! Then looking where it placed in 
NT - IRQ = 21 and 22 !???  Is it possible ??
           --     --
