Hmm, Cardbus and USB problems... you probably have both Cardbus and
i82365 support in your kernel configuration. Your .config file should
have this:
#
# PCMCIA/CardBus support
#
CONFIG_PCMCIA=y
CONFIG_CARDBUS=y
# CONFIG_I82365 is not set
# CONFIG_TCIC is not set
That fixed it for me for at least three laptops.
