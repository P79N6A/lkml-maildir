Ok, this is definitely faster on Core 2 as well, so "numbers talk, 
bullshit walks". No more objections.
(That said, I bet you could do even better for octal and hex numbers, so 
if you *really* want to speed things up, you should just make a 
special-case routine for each base (there's just three of them), and you 
can then also optimize the base-10 thing much better (you can do two 
digits at a time by dividing by 100, etc)
