It's a dual P3 600/100 with 512mb of ram, tyan thunder 100 gx (s1836dulan model) with an onboard aic-7895 dual channel UW SCSI.  I'm booting off channel B (the 68pin only channel) Id 1, which is my seagate 36g SCA drive in a 5 bay sca enclosure.  Id 0 is a ultraplex 40x. Channel A has a 50pin 8x2x20 plexwriter.  The motherboard has a PIIX4 (GX) chipset.  (

)
I've hand copied down what I could of the v6.2.4 driver's debug messages, but wasn't able to catch all of it.  (I hope to switch to serial console as soon as I find a null modem cable and log it that way.)  Shall I send the screenfull to the list or you directly?
Thanks,
