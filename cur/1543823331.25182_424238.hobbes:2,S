Last night compiling kernels in my hotel, my CPUs kept over-heating.
I have a IBM Thinkpad G41 which has a pentium 4 HT.
Before compiling, my CPU temp would start at 65C and go up to 82 before I
kill the compile. At 80 it warns me.  I rebooted a few times, but it would
always happen.  Thinking this might be bad hardware, I rebooted into
2.6.12, and saw that the CPU temperature would be at 52C??  I had no more
problems compiling.
I recently added the Suspend2 patch and that might be the culprit, But I
just booted, a version of 2.6.16 that doesn't have the patch, and it too
seems to be runnig hot.
Hmm, could this be the "acpi_sleep=s3_bios" that Suspend2 asks for?
I haven't removed that option yet.
Anyone else seen this problem?
