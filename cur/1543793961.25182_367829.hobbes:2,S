You missed this page...  :-)
You need to use Julian Anastasov's "send-to-self" patch from ssi.bg/~ja/.
The problem is not with ipt_route, but with the local addresses. If you
want the packet to go out, you need to remove the local route for the
destination. The packet will then go out, but when it will come back,
the system won't take it because its destination won't match a local
route. Try "ip r l t local" to see what I mean.
With Julian's patch, IIRC, you write '1' into /proc/sys/net/ipv4/$IF/loop,
then you define some cross-routes for destinations with the respective
sources from the opposite interfaces, then all packets routed out with
a 'looped' interface address in their source will effectively go out.
I also suggest that you get his whole '-ja' patch, and that you look
in Documentation/networking/ip-sysctl.txt in which he adds some
documentation about this (and I believe there was a more complete
example on his site).
Good luck,
Willy
