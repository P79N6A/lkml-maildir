Most C400s are , in a very general sense, just 300a's with the multiplier set
higher, I don't think they've really done any core changes on it. They'd have
to charge you $500 more and tell you it makes the internet faster, if that
was the case, ie, P3.
The thing that irks me about the P3 is that none of the new instructions
have anything to do with the internet, directly. If ChromeEffects were out
and in use, sure, that would be the case.
Cheers..
