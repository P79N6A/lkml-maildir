What David meant was that "root will always have a slot" doesn't *actually*
help unless you *also* have a way to actually *spawn* such a process.  In order
to do the ps, kill, and so on that you need to recover, you need to already
have either a root shell available, or a way to *get* a root shell that doesn't
rely on a non-root process (so /bin/su doesn't help here).
Many distros will leave a /sbin/mingetty running on tty1 through tty6, and
you *can* use those to get a root shell.  David's point is that without
something like that already in place, the patch doesn't help....
