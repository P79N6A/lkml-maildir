I cannot think of any reason why this change would affect per-cpu tasks.

ok here's when I think a system administrator would want to partition
sched domains. If there is an application that is very sensitive to
performance and latencies and would have very low tolerance for 
interference from any other code running on the cpus, then the
admin would partition the sched domain and separate this application
from the rest of the system. (per-cpu threads obviously will 
continue to run in the same domain as the app)
So in this example, clearly there is no sense in letting a batch job
run in the same sched domain as our application. Now lets say if our
performance and latency sensitive application only runs during the
day, then the admin can turn off the sched domain flag and tear down
the sched domain for the night. This will then enable the batch job
running in the parent cpuset to get a chance to run on all the cpus.
Returning -EINVAL when trying to attach a job to the top cpuset when
it has a child cpuset(s) that has the sched_domain flag turned on, would
mean that the administrator would know that s/he does not have all of
the cpus in that cpuset for their use. However by attaching jobs
(such as the batch job in your example) to the top cpuset, before
doing any sched domain partitioning would mean that they make the best
use of resources as well (sort of a backdoor). However if you feel
that this puts too much of a restriction on the admin for creating
tasks such as the batch job, then we would have to do without it
(just documenting the sched_domain and its effects)

I think this is a case of one set of folks talking <32 cpu systems

Well it makes a difference for applications that have a RT/performance
sensitive componant that needs a sched domain of its own
