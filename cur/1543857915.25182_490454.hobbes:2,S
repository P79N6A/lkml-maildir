I'm not sure how much (if at all) the Intel compiler is actually used, and 
for all I know it may even support __attribute__((__const__)) these days, 
but I like the notion of allowing us to support other compilers, so the 
infrastructure is all set up for that.
The main <linux/compiler.h> thing includes various per-compiler headers, 
and then defaults some things to be empty if the compiler-specific header 
doesn't have its own #define for it. So it's actually set up to try to 
help more than just gcc or the Intel compiler, although nobody has done 
anything else afaik.
I think all versions of gcc support the __attribute__((const)) thing (and 
indeed, it's in the "generic" gcc header file, not the per-gcc-version 
one).
