Sure, that's file data. I was talking about the inode writeback, not the
data writeback.

Depends on how things are being allocated. if you've got inode32 allocation
and >1TB filesytsem, then data is nowhere near the inodes. If you've got large
allocation groups, then data is typically nowhere near the inodes, either. If
you've got full AGs, data will be nowehere near the inodes. If you've got
large files and lots of data to write, then clustering multiple files together
for writing is not needed.  So in many cases, clustering delalloc writes by
inode number doesn't provide any better I/o patterns than not clustering...
The only difference we may see is that if we flush all the data on inodes
in a single cluster, we can get away with a single inode cluster write
for all of the inodes....
Cheers,
Dave.
