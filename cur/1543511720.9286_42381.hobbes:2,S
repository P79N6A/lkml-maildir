You are. The entire point behind the version.h changes is that
applications will see the kernel we're actually using, and not a different
one.
In particular, this is because UTS_RELEASE should say different things
about up and smp kernels.
The only check this change would break is something along the lines of
using grep and sed to check for a value.
Autoconf, for example, doesn't do this; it uses the preprocessor (thereby
including /boot/kernel.h) before running any checks.
