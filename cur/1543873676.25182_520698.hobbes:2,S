Subject: [PATCH 02/14] readahead: state based method: decouple readahead_ratio from growth_limit
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/3/16/60

Remove readahead_ratio from the growth_limit computing in state based method.
It simplifies the size ramp up rules to:
        ahead_window_size = request_size +
                            current_window_size * 2 +
                            readahead_max / 16;
The first two sizes are apparent. The last one has two effects:
1) Ensure that we get acceptable readahead size in early start up phase.
   It is an analog to the old 'first x4 then x2' trick.
2) Ensure that we reach readahead_max within 8 steps.
   It is good for the laptop mode. A user may set a huge readahead_max, and
   expect the kernel to do large I/Os right away.
