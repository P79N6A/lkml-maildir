Do not we get TLB flush also due to latching or are pthread_mutex_lock
etc implemented without one nowadays ?

Hm. What 512Mb of address space loss are you speaking here. Are threaded
programs only able to use 2.5G in  3G/1G memory split ?

You're right.  MySQL does not use gettimeofday very frequently now,
actually it uses time() most of the time, as some platforms used to have
huge performance problems with gettimeofday() in the past.
The amount of gettimeofday() use will increase dramatically in the
future so it is good to know about this matter.
