*grin*
lets have a different interface other than the dev structure( or name them
all like /dev/0, /dev/1, ... /dev/65535), and just have a userspace daemon
watch for device topology changes and create actual links based on
configuration data, i.e. PS/2 mouse becomes /dev/mouse0, USB mouse #1
becomes /dev/mouse1, etc. Just ditch major and minor numbers and the
dev-files altogether.
No major or minor numbers, no real guarantee of order, but a userspace
solution to find the devices when needed.
