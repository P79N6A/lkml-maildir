I wouldn't consider it breaking, more like extending. But regardless 
of userspace, in the future we can also use this same interface in 
order to disable _built-in_ kernel modules and functionlity (e.g.
'nousb' could turn into something more canonical). This can be useful 
for people working in the embedded who compile module-less kernels (if 
module-less kernels are considered bad practicle these days, I'd like
to know more).
Just a thought..
One can even come up with a kernel parameter that allows a developer 
to skip a call to one or more of the initcall functions based on 
its name only even with !CONFIG_KALLSYMS (looks like that except 
for crypto/, almost all initcalls have unique names these days).
