The first patch I had just converted the bit spinlocks to spinlocks but I
thought that adding two spinlocks was too much for every buffer head, even
if it wasn't in the ext3 file system. The journal head spinlock is just
used to add and remove the journal heads from the buffer heads, so I'm not
sure how much contention is on them. I only have a dual smp system, so I
can't test the system on large number of CPUs. What do you think, should
we sacrafice memory for speed?
What should we use instead of #ifdef PREEMPT_RT? Or should we just keep it
the same for both.  Since this fix is only to fix spinlocks that schedule,
I figured that it would be better not to waste the memory of those not
using PREEMPT_RT.  Should I use the opposite PREEMPT_DESKTOP?
Thanks,
