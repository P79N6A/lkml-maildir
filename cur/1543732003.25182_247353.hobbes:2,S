Hi Corey, 
You wrote a nice changelog entry - thanks for that.
I'm not sure if we should apply all of this in v2.4. It looks like a
big driver revamp to me. 
Is is all this critical for being merged in v2.4.x now? 
Would it be very painful/unwanted to maintain only the bugfixes 
and not only new features? What you think about that?
