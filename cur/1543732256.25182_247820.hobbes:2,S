Because you can encapsulate write while you can't encapsulate ioctl
for a start.  And because ascii is good and opaque binary is bad.  You
don't change the target position of your motion device millions of
time per second.  You can easily send your commands and replies
(you're allowed read, too) as text, and immediatly you make logging,
debugging and reproducing actions way easier.  Plus API portability to
64bits/other endian is free.
  OG.
