Yesterday, I was running tcpdump, paging the output with less.  All of a
sudden, less started to dump core (SIGSEGV).  I could not even start less
by itself:
    > less
without it getting a SIGSEGV, and in fact no user could run less without
getting a SIGSEGV, but it did work perfectly a few minutes earlier.  This
morning, I tried to run less again, and now it was working!  No core
dumps!
How can this happen?  Something overwriting the page/buffer cache?
Unfortunately, I don't know how to reproduce it.  I'm writing this because
it was so strange that I felt I had to share it.  There are no messages in
the (dmesg) log.
/Tobias, a little bit worried
