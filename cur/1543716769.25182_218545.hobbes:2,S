Results with the deadline scheduler on my hardware:
Time spent for test:  92.8340s
no of times window reset because of hits: 0
no of times window reset because of misses: 0
no of times window was shrunk because of hits: 1108
no of times the page request was non-contiguous: 5860
no of times the page request was contiguous : 18091
I have updated the results on the SysBench home page with 2.6.6-rc3 with the 
patch applied.
