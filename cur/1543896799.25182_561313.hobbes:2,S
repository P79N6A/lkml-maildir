two copy region: one for first kernel, and one for second kernel? it
should work.
first kernel is using [64M, 128M), and the second will get assign to
[64M,128M) again.
when it try to memset to clear that region it will cause restart.
in that region, only first 256K can not touched, even read. rest could
be accessed.
