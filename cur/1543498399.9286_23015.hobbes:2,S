Is anybody else using ALSA? Because devfs is such a horrible idea, they have
decided to create a bunch of device nodes in /proc:
xanadu:~$ ls -l /proc/asound/dev
total 0
crw-rw-rw-   1 root     root     116,   0 Jun  9 10:18 controlC0
crw-rw-rw-   1 root     root     116,   8 Jun  9 10:18 midiC0D0

these are of course dynamically created based on what devices the sound
driver has detected. To use them, symlinks are supposed to be created in
dev(!). So instead of device nodes that can't be opened, we just have
dangling symlinks :(
Maybe the SCSI subsystem should dynamically create devices in
/proc/scsi/<controller>/<bus>/ too?
What I mean is, if ALSA is going to become a standard part of the kernel,
devfs would be a nice companion, so that we could avoid moving /dev into an
already somewhat ridiculous /proc filesystem.
