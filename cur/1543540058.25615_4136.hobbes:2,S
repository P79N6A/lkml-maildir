   Now that we have a 'non-module' object in /lib/modules, we could simply
   copy System.map and the bzImage/vmlinux there and rename it to /kernel ...
That certainly makes a lot of sense; I've alwyas thought it was a bit
odd that some stuff was in /lib/modules and Systemp.map and bzImage are 
stored in /boot.  My guess is this is because Linus doesn't use modules,
so he doesn't see this particular aesthetic fault.  :-)  
I'm not entirely sure that now is the best time to make such a change,
but it does make a certain amount of sense.
