But menuconfig is totally innocent, I can't see why you keep blaming
things on it. xconfig is the villain here. Oh, I did some of the changes
in fs/partition/Config.in, so if you want to blame someone, it's probably
me you should blame. I did it to make the code readable, properly indented
(this failed, however, because of (guess what?) xconfig being unable to
have multiple entries for the same config-option.
Oh, and while you don't test make menuconfig or make xconfig, I don't test
make config or make oldconfig, so... There is a place for at least two of
them. In my opinion, xconfig isn't really worth keeping, because it's not
functional anyway. But hopefully, Michael E. Chastain's new program will
cure this.
