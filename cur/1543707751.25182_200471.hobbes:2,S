Eh?  Signals are queued, and the file descriptor number is stored in
the siginfo.

dnotify _should_ be quite low overhead, although not as low as your
syscall of course.  I've never measured it, nor looked much at the
kernel code, but in principle delivering a siginfo through
sigtimedwait() should be quite fast.
But I agree it's too much.  Hence:

Yes yes, but I'm thinking of the _many_ other applications that aren't
Samba and could benefit from a similar facility.  Also, dnotify is
there already - the signalling mechanism isn't pretty, but the hooks
to catch directory changes are fine.
By the way, what is the scope of O_CLEAN?  Does it fail if _any_
operation was done to the directory, or only if operations were done
by non-Samba tasks?  If the former, it has the same scalability
problem that Linus mentioned: Samba shouldn't have to evict its cache
when it creates files itself.  If the latter, is the test
process-wide, thread-wide, or CLONE_FILES-wide?
