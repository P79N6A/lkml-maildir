     Had a machine (Sparc LX) hang hard tonight.  It's running Linux 2.2.10,
and has, until now been almost totally stable (I've had one swapper OOPs since
running 2.2.x on this machine).  I haven't changed anything recently on this. 
It was totally hung, not even L1-A did anything.  Had to power cycle the
machine where upon it booted and came up fine. 
     I was writing backups at the time it crashed.  The tape drive is on
another machine and backups are done over the network using dump.
