OK.  I'm still a bit concerned about bypassing the bitops synchronisation:
barriers, volatile, etc.  We had lengthy ruminations on that a few years
ago, I think when working on free_pages_check().

hm.  The lack of parenthesisation here _might_ be OK, but I haven't
thought it through.
And I'd prefer not to have to, because I know that the do { } while (0)
thing works.  As do static inline functions.

You meant __SetPageCompound and __ClearPageCompound.
