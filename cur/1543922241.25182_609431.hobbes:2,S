I've got no intention to do so currently.

I think E2BIG for the former for backwards compatabilty; the latter
could be either ENOSPC or E2BIG; i.e. both checks are useful - one to
stop us allocating more memory than is sensible, and one to stop us
overrunning the buffer; the fact that these two are the same size at
the moment is coincidence.
I guess ideally the first check would be for the max() of any of the
data structures that we expect to be able to write over; PATH_MAX was
just picked as a convenience.
