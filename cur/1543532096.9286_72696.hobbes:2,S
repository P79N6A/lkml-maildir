One question first. Why is it that almost no one had any problems with too
long ide cables a year and a half ago but today many people do?
I tried to copy a file from a 'home made [tm]' vcd.
I can copy every other file, but not files from my home made
vcd's. I can't read them when using my dvdplayer either but that
could be a problem with my dvd software. 
My IDE cable has not been too long the last 2 years so I don't know what
should cause this problem now...
I use a Creative dxr2 2x DVD (IDE) to mount and copy these files.
Any info appreciated.
Here is the output from messages:
