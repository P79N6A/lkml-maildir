I have an A8N-E motherboard with AthlonX2 and the ACPI definitions are 
missing the HPET (standard feature of Asus motherboards).
I too got interested to get my motherboard working. Luckily I found this 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/12/17/69
 from which I generated the following patch:

Now Linux seems to detect HPET and it passes at least the basic sanity checks:
Force enabled HPET. Base address 0xfefff000
HPET: hpet_period 40000000, hpet_tick 83333
Successfully registered HPET clocksource
Unfortunately the 2.6.20-mm2 kernel to which I tried to patch the patch series 
seems to hang few seconds later after half way in udev startup event 
processing.
It could either be something totally different in 2.6.20-mm2 that just happens 
to fail or more likely some interrupt setup that still needs to be done.
I have no idea how to continue from here.
