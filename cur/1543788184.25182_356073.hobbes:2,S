It seems that the problem comes down to the call to getnstimeofday in
do_gettimeofday.
void getnstimeofday(struct timespec *ts)
{
	nsec_t delta;
	unsigned long seq;
	/* atomically read __monotonic_clock() */
	do {
		seq = read_seqbegin(&system_time_lock);
		delta = __monotonic_clock() - xtime_last_update;
		*ts = xtime_last_update_ts;
	} while (read_seqretry(&system_time_lock, seq));
	set_normalized_timespec(ts,
				ts->tv_sec,
				ts->tv_nsec + (long) delta);
}
I found that xtime_last_update is not updated while hackbench is running,
and the delta ends up being 16 billion and some change. So the call to
set_normalized_timespec overflows with the (long) delta.
