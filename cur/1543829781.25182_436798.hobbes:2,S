the why is relatively easy ;)
since the "is a softirq executing" bit is on the stack, and each context
(user, soft and hard irq) has their own stack, it's not automatic that
the hardirq stack gets the softirq-executing flag... which your patch
fixes.
NMI's and apic irqs generally don't go via the normal irq path and thus
don't do a stack switch... so they don't lose the bit (for accounting
purposes)
