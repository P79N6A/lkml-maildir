This indicates a problem with the very first execve() and/or its shared
libraries.  It is likely that printk() of the arguments and results
to elf_map() and load_elf_interp(), both in fs/binfmt_elf.c,
will aid in finding the problem.  This I would do, if I had hardware.
Are there any reports, either success or failure, for any other 64-bit
architecture?
