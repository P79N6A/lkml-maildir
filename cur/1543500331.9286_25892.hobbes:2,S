Well, I got this asus P5A board last monday, and the problem got real worse
(the system started crashing at boot - even with slowest memory setting
possible). Yesterday evening I went to a friend, and lend his memory.
Instant result: All problems are gone. So I guess the newer kernels
(>=2.2.0) just triggered an existing hardware failure by making my machine
working more efficient ;-) Bought the dimm in december last year, so I'll
bring it back to the store and have 'em give me some working memory...
Btw, there's 8ns memory on my dimm, and 7ns on my friends'. Do you know what
it should be?
Thanks for your time.
