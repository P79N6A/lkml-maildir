There's already a counterpart for ECN blackholes, so I'm not opposed to it.
However, keeping up with new reports, re-testing existing offenders, etc.
takes up a good chunk of time, so I don't have the time to do it myself. I'm
happy to reference such a site, however.
Though - I'm not familiar with the problem of SACK vandals either. There
appears to be a thread on here, I'll go read it...
