Hi,
I am trying to get DMAable memory on i386
(kmalloc(GFP_DMA,)) but seems 
_PAGE_PCD is not set on the pages that i get back the
memory from. Am I 
getting the correct results? If yes, then is it not
that GFP_DMA should 
give me non-cacheable memory (equivalent to setting
_PAGE_PCD along 
with _PAGE_PWT on i386). Can anyone confirm for me
that GFP_DMA will 
*always* give me non-cacheable and contiguous memory.
Many thanks in advance.
