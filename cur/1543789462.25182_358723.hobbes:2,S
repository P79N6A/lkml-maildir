                                        I assume there's an ocfs2_data_lock
                                        hereabouts?

Why does ocfs2_readpage() need to take ocfs2_data_lock?  (Is
ocfs2_data_lock a range-based read-lock thing, or what?)

Oh.
Have you considered using invalidate_inode_pages() instead of
truncate_inode_pages()?  If that leaves any pages behind, drop the read
lock, sleep a bit, try again - something klunky like that might get you out
of trouble, dunno.
