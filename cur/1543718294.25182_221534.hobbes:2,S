A problem with htree was recently discovered during Lustre testing when
files were being renamed within the same directory.  In some cases the
addition of the new name caused a directory block split and the old
dir_entry was pointing at the wrong entry, and the wrong entry was removed.
This would seem entirely possible in a Maildir directory, since the MTA
will be doing a lot of renames within the same directory.
This seems to fix the majority of the problems, although there are still
some rare failures in the rename test.
