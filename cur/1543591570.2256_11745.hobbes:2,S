ioctls are even more evil than encoding limits into the name. Cease
and desist, please.

Ben's patch makes initrd mandatory.

It doesn't

We will be much better off providing a sane API from the kernel. And
dropping the layout-aware code from fdisk, parted, yodda, yodda.
Libraries do not remove code duplication. You still need to relink the
stuff you keep statically linked, etc. Otherwise you get version skew.
Big way. Besides, you can't use library from a script, etc.
