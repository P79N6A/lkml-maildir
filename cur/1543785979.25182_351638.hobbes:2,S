A CPU is idle and then is preempted and starting offline CPU. After
calling stop_machine_run, the CPU goes into idle and it will resume last
idle loop. If the CPU is broken at specific point, then the CPU will
continue executing previous idle and have no chance to call play_dead.
Am I missing anything? Nigel's patch seems can fix the situation for
mwait_idle and poll_idle but can't fix for default_idle in i386 to me.
Thanks,
