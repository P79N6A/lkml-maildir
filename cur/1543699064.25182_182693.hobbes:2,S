I have been developing a SCSI based application and facing hardship due 
to lack of  better debugging support in SCSI domain on linux. May be I 
am not very familiar with linux scsi subsystem.
 I have a lost IO, sitting somewhere in some queue. The scsi logging 
facility has been turned on with : echo "scsi log all" > /proc/scsi/scsi.
The syslog shows that the request has started:
scsi_do_req (host = 0, channel = 0 target = 3, buffer =00000000, bufflen 
= 0, d)command : 00  20  00  00  00  00
Leaving scsi_do_req()
The SCSI bus trace does not show any activity.
I guess only way to find out the state of the IO is to put printf and 
recompile the kernel. HP-UX had facilities like  lkcd, linux crash dump 
analyzer. I used to be called q4. A perl script could be written to 
navigate kernel data structures and extract information from them on a 
running system. If we had that kind of tool already into linux then 
debugging the live system would be easier.
Is there a plan to include lkcd into  default kernel?
