This might be a little offtopic, but here it goes:
It seems that people using linux 2.0 with libc6 have either a problem
with select() or poll(), depending on distribution. People using RedHat
have a problem with poll(), people with Debian with select().
There appears to be no problem with libc5. They both seem to work on
2.2, atleast on RedHat.
All this is what I hear from people, so I can't be more specific about
it.
