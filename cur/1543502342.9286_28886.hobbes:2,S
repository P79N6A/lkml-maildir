Hi Tim,
    Its not quite that simple for me.  I have a breakpoint set in main(),
and when it get to that breakpoint everthing still works.  Then I do
a continue, and somewhere along the way I cant start other programs.
I assumed it was due to the pthreads, but I dont know that.
Hope this helps,
Jim
