True only when the white background is passive, such as a printed page.  I 
don't know if any conclusive studies have been done regarding CRTs, but the 
standard rule doesn't seem to hold all that well... mainly because while it 
works if you turn down the brightness enough, you then can't see 
low-contrast stuff very well (and if you turn up the contrast, the white 
becomes too bright again).

    We are Linux. Resistance is an indication that you missed the point.
