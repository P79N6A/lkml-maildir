Up to the maintainer. I've been very busy on thesis stuff but I'll try
and split it out for 2.6.12pre if Bartlomiej wants the changes.
As to the DVD media hang - I think that is unrelated. The ide-cd fixes
deal with end of media error handling primarily and better reporting of
sense data. That affects multisession discs, readahead and some other
oddments rather than any hang cases
