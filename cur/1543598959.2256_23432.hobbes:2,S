Russell King has been working on a architecture independant framework
for this kind of feature. I recently started work on VIA support for it.
After this weekend, my socket 370 motherboard should turn up and
I'll be able to test / finish the support for it.
You can find the code so far at..
cvs -d :pserver:cvs@pubcvs.arm.linux.org.uk:/mnt/src/cvsroot login
cvs -d :pserver:cvs@pubcvs.arm.linux.org.uk:/mnt/src/cvsroot co cpufreq
So far, there are several implementations in there, in various stages
of completion. The various x86 types need finishing, and it'll be
ready (as long as rmk has nothing else to add to it) for submission.
regards,
Dave.
