Greetings,
Somewhere between 2.6.2-rc3 and 2.6.2, more specificly between 2.6.2-rc3 and
2.6.2-rc3-mm1 appeared a patch in the bitkeeper, that was included in
linux.patch used in 2.6.2-rc3-mm1, in 2.6.2 and it's still present.
The patch follows:

                return 0;
        /* show the full disk and all non-0 size partitions of it */
This patch should be -R's ASAP, since it cause major problems: as an example, I
have an Asus M3700N laptopwhere this patch causes the system to do this:

If I revert the patch lilo runs normally.
