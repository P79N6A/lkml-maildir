the overriding argument is that the bit needs to be maintained by Samba
expliticly - i.e. no way around sys_mark_dir_clean() and O_CLEAN. And if
we've done that it costs us _nothing_ to return the previous bit value
in sys_mark_dir_clean() - which Samba can use to build a 100% coherent
name cache. At which point i can see no reason at all to use any variant
of dnotify/select/poll/epoll.
Also, one-shot mode will make you lose multiple outstanding events from
multiple directories, unless you associate separate signals with each
directory watched - which will make you run out of the 64 signals very
quick.

it still queues up kernel structures (dnotify event structures and
signal structures) which can get lost or can overflow, etc. The 'clean
bit' has no such queueing problem.

why? A synchronous lookup is just that - a synchronous lookup. There's
no need at all for Samba to know about all namespace activities. What it
wants to have is coherency between its own cache and the VFS.
dnotify (or epoll) is useful for applications that need to know about
all events: eg. directory visualisation apps. For everything else (like
Samba) it's too much overhead i believe.

Samba doesnt want to 'wait' for any event. It just wants to keep in sync
with the VFS in a minimalistic way: update the cache only when
absolutely necessary. Think of it as a CPU's cache validation protocol -
you dont want to re-read invalid cachelines all the time, only if they
are really needed.
