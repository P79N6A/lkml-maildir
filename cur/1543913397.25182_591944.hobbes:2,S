Just one hand up: I haven't tested the patch pointed to by Andrew, will
do asap, but it seems that contains the changes from
https://bugtrack.alsa-project.org/alsa-bug/view.php?id=3104
which are needed to have sound at all on my toshiba (although with some
remaining problems). I am not able to say if it's .23 material or not,
nor if it's a regression or not, being this a quite new laptop... but
maybe it's better to have a release with some sound and then fix it
properly after?
Thanks for your hard work,
	Romano
