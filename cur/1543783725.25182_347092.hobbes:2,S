Hi,
I've noticed that 8250_hp300 is buggy wrt the ordering of hardware
initialisation to the visibility of devices to user space.  Namely,
8250_hp300 does the following:
        line = serial8250_register_port(&port);
...
        /* Enable board-interrupts */
        out_8(d->resource.start + DIO_VIRADDRBASE + DCA_IC, DCA_IC_IE);
        dio_set_drvdata(d, (void *)line);
        /* Reset the DCA */
        out_8(d->resource.start + DIO_VIRADDRBASE + DCA_ID, 0xff);
        udelay(100);
serial8250_register_port() makes the port visible to userspace, so
from that point on it could be opened.  However, if it's opened
prior to the remainder of the above completing, we will be missing
interrupts (and what effect does "reset the DCA" have?)
Surely this hardware fiddling should be completed before we register
the port?
