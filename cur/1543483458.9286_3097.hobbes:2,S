I get the same error trying to output sound cleanly
in RH 5.2 with 2.2.0pre9 and 2.2.1.  I have chosen many
IRQ, DMA and io setups as well as various sndconfig
options and even hand editing /etc/conf.modules!
Same error message every time, until I boot back up
with 2.0.36 again.
Seen any other ESS1688 soundcard owners (in a Compaq Presario
7240)
complain of this plight?  I here there is a huge memory gain
from
members of our LUG who have yet to have problems, so I was
anxious
to get sound squared-away as I love sound with Linux!
Thanks, Jeff
