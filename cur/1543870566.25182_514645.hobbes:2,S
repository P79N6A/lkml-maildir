Subject: 2.6.21-rc1 kwin dies silently
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

openSUSE 10.3 Alpha and KDE-3.5.6, xorg-x11-7.2. KDE is setup not to 
require a password to unlock, but it asks for password. When the screen 
unlocks, kwin is gone with no errors logged in /var/log/kdm or 
/var/log/messages. No problems with 2.6.20.
Regards
Sid.
