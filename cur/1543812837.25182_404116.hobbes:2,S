The -rt patch uses the lastest stuff from Thomas Gleixner, John Stultz and
of course Ingo Molnar.  The functions you are interested in, are in
kernel/time/ directory.  Take a look at clockevents.c and perhaps
handle_tick().  I'm not sure what LTTng is doing there, but this will give
you a direction in which way to look.
