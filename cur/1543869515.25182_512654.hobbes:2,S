I think I actually used dmraid, and the problem I had in those days
was that it was just a layer over your legacy IDE drivers.
With 2.4 you had "real" drivers whom created block devices if I recall
correctly which you could really treat as disks.
If dmraid still works as it did in the days I used it it's just a
layer, like LVM, and the kernel itself doesnt care at all for the
disks being in a RAID set or not and will access the disks
independently, this I really found a reason to not use dmraid and
stick with MD devices.
And by the reactions from you guys I guess those reasons still exist :)
So MD it is,
Thanks!
