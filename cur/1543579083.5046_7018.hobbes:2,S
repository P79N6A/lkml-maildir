OTOH, it _would_ get rid of all the balancing issues in one
blow. And it would fix the aliasing issues and possibly the
memory fragmentation problem too.
And using something like Davem's lower-overhead reverse
mapping layer, we might just be able to pull off all (or most)
of the advantages with lower overhead ;)
[this is something I will be looking into for 2.5]
