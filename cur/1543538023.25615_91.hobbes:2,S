Hello,
I just installed devfsd-1.3.9-1mdk.i586.rpm onto a fresh SuSE 6.3
system with linux-2.4.0-test2-ac2, devfs enabled, and found out, that
at first, some virtual consoles are not registered. I got following in
the syslog:
...

When I switch with Alt+3 to the third console, after some time, the
entry /dev/vcc/3 (and /dev/vcs3) appears, and then it works. But,
because even when using devfsd as "compatibility manager", there are
failures (no immediate access to other virtual consoles), I suppose
that this is a bug.
Can anybody confirm or disprove this?
Xuân. :o)
