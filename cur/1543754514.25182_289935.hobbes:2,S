Yep, looks like the right thing to do. I don't know about moving the
rounding into MM_VM_SIZE though - it is basically just a requirement of
clear_page_range. Might be better to leave it there?

Considering the comments by Ian and Russell, can we remove the special
casing by going in the other direction; feed FIRST_USER_PGD_NR * PGDIR_SIZE
to tlb_finish_mmu? Ian, Russell, this would only be a change to your
architectures... so long as your tlb_finish_mmu isn't doing something
special when it sees a zero argument AFAIKS that would be OK?
