No. The point is that a (correct, complete) policy will prevent the user
from copying the contents to a file with less protection, by any means. No,

Besides, the point behind the targeted policy in Red Hat/Fedora is to
forbid certain daemons to do nasty stuff. It is an additional protection
against misconfiguration or processes taken over by crackers.
