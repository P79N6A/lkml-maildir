Um, many people who are being probed from the Internet would like very
much to NOT have it there, certainly by default. And would like to send an
arp request and in return get a valid mac address.
I totally miss why anyone would consider this behaviouracceptable, much
less desirable. Perhaps you or someone could explain why either accepting
source routing or sending out invalid arp responses are desirable at all,
much less as default behaviour. One is a security hole, the other brings
the network group to the door with arpwatch output.
After some hours of reading the google results I see lots of questions, a
few dubious workarounds, and zero people claiming that it's a good thing
to work that way.
