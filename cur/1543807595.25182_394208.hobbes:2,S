Yes that is what it's supposed to be doing.

At least remnants from my old 80% hack to avoid this (huge_page_needed)
seem to be still there in mainline:
fs/hugetlbfs/inode.c:hugetlbfs_file_mmap
   bytes = huge_pages_needed(mapping, vma);
   if (!is_hugepage_mem_enough(bytes))
          return -ENOMEM;
So something must be broken if this doesn't work. Or did you allocate
the pages in some other way? 
From taking a quick look at ipc/shm.c it might be missing an equivalent 
check when allocating a huge page segment.
