Hi,
I posted a while back about a storage array I'm setting up using
Software RAID, LVM, XFS, and NFS. Some problems have been fixed in the
2.6.10 release, however one problem remains and exhibits itself during
heavy I/O that appears to be related to XFS.
Due to its size, I've posted my debug info at this location (I've
included output from all of the above kernels):

 (~80kb)
Please let me know if I've left anything out that would help in
locating the source of the problem. I'm very willing to try out any
patches/config changes.
please cc me on any replies, as I am not subscribed to the list...
