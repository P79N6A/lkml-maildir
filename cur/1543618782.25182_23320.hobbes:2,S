Surely the major point of using the compiler's _Bool would be for type 
safety -  if you only want readability then you may as well just use:
enum bool {true = 1, false = 0};
Now since C has historically utilized integer expressions for 
conditionals (with 0, !0 truth semantics), so it would be obnoxious to 
*unconditionally* make if (x) where x is non _Bool generate warnings, 
but IMO the whole point of using _Bool would be to then choose to turn 
on warnings for non _Bool conditionals, and to suppress warnings one 
would then need to be explicit about intentions by writing code such as:
if ((_Bool) (x = y)) ;
and hopefully if one accidently wrote:
if ((_Bool) x = y) ; /* int x, y */
then the compiler would warn that you probably didn't really mean that, 
since it means:
if ((_Bool) (x = (int) (_Bool) y)) ;
Which would have converted your y to _Bool (0/1) before assigning it to x.
