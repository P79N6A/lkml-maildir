Ingo' message that caused me to change the subject of this thread was
  
http://lkml.org/lkml/2008/4/30/446
Ingo's patch did not point at the actual problem at all (it was a x86 
bug and Ingo's patch was for input). But he tried to push his bogus 
patch through Dmitry who had correctly stated that the patch was wrong.
This way of "sharing fixes" even against a correct maintainer NAK is 
what annoys me.
Am I really wrong as usual on that?
And most issues randconfig finds are some cornercases unlikely to happen 
for users (hey, this thread is about a bug only occuring in 
configurations that include support for an X-Box gamepad in a kernel for 
an RDC R-321x SoC), so there's usually no need to hurry but time to look 
at the problem and fix it properly.

Since when is he actually doing regular randconfig builds?
The only person from whom I'm aware of regularly seeing reports of build 
breakages with randconfig on linux-kernel for many years is Toralf.

When talking about "self-righteous behaviour" please also talk about how 
Ingo rants about kconfig and makes statements like "All the information 
is already in the Kconfig files for the kconfig tool/subsystem to make 
an intelligent decision." [1] that are simply wrong.
