        * Derive genksyms prefix from well known symbol, automatically picks up
          unusual symbol prefixes.  Suggested by Edouard G. Parmelan because

        * Truncate alias loops.  Pass alias result to probe[all].  Bug found and
          patch suggested by Pablo Bianucci, different implementation by Keith
          Owens.
Anybody using devfs should upgrade to modutils 2.3.10, otherwise the
suggested modules.conf in Documentation/filesystem/devfs does not work.
