In this case, disabling preempt around the for_each_online_cpu loop
would prevent any cpu from going down in the meantime.  But since this
function doesn't look like it's a hot path, and we're potentially
traversing lots of zones and cpus, lock_cpu_hotplug might be preferable.
As Paul noted, the fix as it stands isn't adequate.
