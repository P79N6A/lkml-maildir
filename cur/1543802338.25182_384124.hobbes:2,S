Well, for LVDS (internal LCD) I found, that PLL pixel clock is fixed accross any
resloution. This means that black magick used for PLL clock is not needed,
driver just need to read initial value of PLL registers and keep it (for
suspend/resume). It works to set resolution 640x480 using BIOS and then to 
correct Pipes and Display planes to any resolution you want (usualy the 
resolution of LCD). I guess that resolution 640x480 can be programmed directly
without BIOS (but I need to check it).
Another discover is that 0x61204 & ~1 allows LVDS register to be changed (and
also it disables LVDS output (DPMS D3 on LVDS). 0x61204 | 1 enables it back.
