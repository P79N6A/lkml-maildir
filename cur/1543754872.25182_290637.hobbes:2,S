that is correct. Jackd already has a watchdog thread, against lockups.
i'm wondering, couldnt Jackd solve this whole issue completely in
user-space, via a simple setuid-root wrapper app that does nothing else
but validates whether the user is in the 'jackd' group and then keeps a
pipe open to to the real jackd process which it forks off, deprivileges
and exec()s? Then unprivileged jackd could request RT-priority changes
via that pipe in a straightforward way. Jack normally gets installed as
root/admin anyway, so it's not like this couldnt be done.
