Regarding the new code in arch/i386/mach-visws/mpparse.c,
Shouldn't the code that is in find_smp_config() really go in
get_smp_config? I would think all find_smp_config would do would be set
smp_found_config to 1.
Was there a reason for this, or is this just how you got it working?
Thanks -- Regards -- Andy
