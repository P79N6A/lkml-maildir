Actually, libata core layer already does it.  It never mixes NCQ and 
non-NCQ commands.  sata_nv can safely assume that those two sets of 
commands are always issued disjointly.  The relevant function is 
libata-scsi.c::ata_scmd_need_defer().

It would be nice to have that but I'm doubtful it would worth the 
effort.  I would just leave it as it is as long as it works.

Not only that, hopefully, it will show better EH behavior.  sata_nv's TF 
register mode sometimes hangs holding PCI bus (as in IORDY lockup). 
This happens a lot if you pull a disk out while it's actively processing 
a command but doesn't seem to be restricted to that.  Also, it has been 
suggested that sata_nv's TF register mode might involve some nasty SMM 
code.  I don't recall whether it was verified tho.
Anyways, it would be very nice to have working nv_adma.  I have a CK804 
nv but it's my primary work machine and I'm too lazy to develop on it, 
but I would be more than happy to test or answer questions.
Thanks.
