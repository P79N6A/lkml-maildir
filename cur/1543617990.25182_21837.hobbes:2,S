What if he's trying to build UML to run on NetBSD? What if the best QA'd 
cross-gcc he has available is a generic arm-elf-gcc and he doesn't want to 
rebuild and do a full test and release cycle on it just because a handful 
of the kernel header files assume __linux__ will be defined?

If you don't know, who was it that typed 'This is definitely wrong' in your 
first mail? Your cat?

Well, if he hadn't explicitly mentioned that he made header files which 
could be included by userspace use defined(__KERNEL__)||defined(__linux__)
then I'd understand what you meant. As it is, I don't. Please explain.
