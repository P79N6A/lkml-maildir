I said it poorly. In the POSIX spec, the child is born single threaded.
To quote:
 16) A process is created with a single thread. If a multithreaded process
    calls fork(), the new process shall contain a replica of the calling
    thread and its entire address space, possibly including the states of
    mutexes and other resources. Consequently, to avoid errors,
    the child process may only execute async-signal safe operations
    (see 3.3.1.3) until such time as one of the exec functions is called.
    If {_POSIX_THREADS} is defined, fork handlers may be established
    by means of the pthread_atfork() function in order to maintain 
    qpplication invariants across fork() calls.
