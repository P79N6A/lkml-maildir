Dhaval, how about the other problem you had - do you have any guess 
what it might be related to?
i'm also wondering - what would be the easiest way to integrate kexec 
into an automated test environment. If i have a bzImage kernel, is kexec 
still supposed to work? Could i for example do a reboot into a new 
(kexec-enabled) kernel via kexec in essence?
