Today I looked into this and I found a few ext2 and othe fses SMP races
and a genuine UP race in wait_on_inode (iget/iput). I also fixed the not
necessary double calling of clear_inode and added some commentary (see
mainly the fs.h commentary). I am been careful only about ext2 and nfs and
proc. I also checked fat and it seems to have its own locking so it should
work fine in SMP too (I haven't tried fat though). (right fix for proc
should be to change the proc_dir_entry->count to atomic_t but I didn't do
that to not bloat the patch with details, it can be trivially improved
with an incremental patch)
It applys cleanly on top of 2.3.47pre[26] and it fixes the popular 2.3.x
inode corruption (aka "rm: cannot remove file: Input/output errors").
