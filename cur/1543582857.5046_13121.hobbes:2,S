Does this have to do with the thing that kills off processes when memory
is low?
Feb 23 04:39:32 nano kernel: VM: do_try_to_free_pages failed for xkill
Maybe xkill should be something allowed to run? The app that I ran
freaked(slrnconf) and snarfed up all my memory rapidly. If I could have
killed it xkill maybe it would not have been a problem.
Just a tought.
