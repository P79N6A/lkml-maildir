Hmm, doesn't look like it:

Upon reading the value 0xffffffff for csr5, the if statement would be false.
Maybe it bails out later or something, but really why risk it?  As Ben noted,
it's easy to have race conditions between power off and interrupt handler
routines.  Also, there is a transition delay between D0 and D3.  I prefer to
play it safe and call free_irq().
There are other reasons to use free_irq().  For example, if we want to
support runtime device suspends, leaving a stale interrupt handler may
subtract from the performance of other devices sharing that interrupt...
especially in this case, where it's making pci transactions and reading
back 0xffffffff.

I think it's ok.
pci_power_t pci_choose_state(struct pci_dev *dev, pm_message_t state)
{
	if (!pci_find_capability(dev, PCI_CAP_ID_PM))
		return PCI_D0;
	switch (state) {
	case 0: return PCI_D0;
	case 3: return PCI_D3hot;
	default:
		printk("They asked me for state %d\n", state);
		BUG();
	}
	return PCI_D0;
}
It just checks if PCI function supports the power management capability.  If
it does we go to D3hot, if not, we stay at D0.  So the only case where it
wouldn't go to D3hot is when the device can't physically make the transition
through the PCI PM mechanism.

Yeah, I think you're right.
Also, after looking at some other netdev suspend routines, it appears that
"netif_device_present" isn't necessary.  Jeff, is this correct?
Thanks,
