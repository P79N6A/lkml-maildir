Wow!  That's super.  Now about the only thing left is to get it included
in the standard kernel.  Do you think Linus Torvalds is more likely
to accept these patches than Ingo's?  I sure hope this one works out.

Well it's extremely nice to see NFS included at least.  I was really
worried about that one.  What about Samba?  (Keeping in mind that
serious "professional" musicians will likely have their Linux systems
networked to a Windows box, at least until they have all the necessary
tools on Linux.

Did that email pass by me unnoticed?  What's the prob with XF86 4.0?
