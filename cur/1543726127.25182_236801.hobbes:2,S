Without CONFIG_WATCHDOG_NOWAYOUT (or nowayout=1 module option added by my 
patch just sent to lkml) when /dev/watchdog is closed then watchdog timer is 
disabled.

Currently these two are unrelated in technical terms.

CONFIG_WATCHDOG only purpose is to disable all watchdogs living in 
drivers/char/watchdog directory, nothing more. Enabling it doesn't add any 
code unless you also add some specific watchdog.
ipmi_watchdog relies on IPMI (IPMI_HANDLER) and probably that's why it's 
listed separatly.
