Well just to be sure i reran the test with `-vo null' (and fwiw i tried
few completely different output drivers) the behavior is the same. I'm
not running Core2Duo but X2, but guess that does not really matter here.
As for the task that monitors, i've written it myself (there are two
monitoring methods, one(the accurate) does not depend on contets of
`/proc/stat' at all), so it can be cheaply (for me) changed in any
way one wants. Sources are available at the same place where screenshot
was found.

This is what it looked like before: 
http://www.boblycat.org/~malc/apc/load-x2-hog.png
Now integral load matches the one obtained via the "accurate" method.
However the report for individual cores are of by around 20% percent.
Though i'm not quite sure what you mean by "which ones are improved".

Oh, the famous "With enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow." in action.
