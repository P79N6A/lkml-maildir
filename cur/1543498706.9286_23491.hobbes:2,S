And even when you buy it is sucks. It's buggy, slow and non-linux-ettiqueted (costs money, of course).

It's a PnP chip so you need to initialize it first. There are 2 ways: using the BIOS PnP extension (uglyyy)
or isapnp ( Gee, you have a /<linux source tree>/Documentation/sound/OPL3-SA2 file! What could it be? Where 
do I learn about it? Well, when you compile a kernel in a tremendous way and hilight many unuseful options
don't forget there is a <Help> button waiting down there).

I guess it's not a hacking problem but a very ordinary one since all old soundcards were designed using
the M$ PnP way :(

Good luck in trying it with the following versions! :) make sure you don't miss one.

Well, this time use a chainsaw !:))

Well, you might have better chances with redhat, it has a soundconf or something like this that <kinda>
works in some peculiar strange cases.
