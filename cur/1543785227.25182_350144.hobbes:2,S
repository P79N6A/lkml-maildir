There's nothing to say that the kernel couldn't have hardware programmed 
to give an interrupt and schedule your process at some point that wouldn't 
normally be a scheduler tick. So the HRT interface could give you better 
than HZ. Also, there's the possibility that the kernel could slack off on 
HZ when you're not using HRT, and then there are patches for "tickless", 
where it just programs the timer for the next time something is scheduled 
to happen, and there's no fixed rate outside of actual activity.
