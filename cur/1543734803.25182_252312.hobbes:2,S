In published code: No access control whatsoever. In dev tree: Silently
dropped. Possible: Any kind of error and additional information that
makes sense (we have netlink messages as a transport, after all).
That said, I don't think dropping tasks silently is a "worst case"
in this scenario. Whatever your error report is going to be, it will
boil down to saying "some tasks that may or may not live by the time
you read this have been skipped because some fields that you knew had
access restrictions prevented providing the information in those cases,
and I must be cautious about not revealing any sensitive information
to you so sorry I can't be more helpful". What's a tool going to do
with that? If it cares to get a complete snapshot, it can simply send
two requests: One with and one without restricted fields.
So the tool would, say, request PID/VmSize in the first message and
environ in the second message. Since only the owner can read the
environment, the second request would yield answers only for a subset
of the total process table.
