I know I am bad for not reporting that earlier but swsusp was working
OK for me till about 3 month ago when I started getting "soft lockup
detected on CPU0" with no useable backtrace 3 times out of 4. I
somehow suspect that having automounted nfs helps it to fail
somehow...
For the record - I never tried swsuspend2 as I am tracking the tip of
Linus's tree and prefre to have the tree clean for my work anyway.
