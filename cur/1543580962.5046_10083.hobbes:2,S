Greetings.
Does anyone know what would cause a lockup when (2.4.x):
  * supsending to disk
  * changing from X to a virtual console
with APM enabled?  Changing from X to a VC functions when APM is
  compiled out.
Essentially, the screen blanks once and the machine locks up.
  Usually while suspending, the screen blanks at least twice.
  The 2.2.1[78] kernels work fine.
Has anyone else seen this behaviour?  I'm seeing this on a Toshiba 
  Satellite 1605CDS.
Thanks!
                              -Joseph
