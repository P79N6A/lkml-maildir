Hi, burning a dvd iso now fails :(
$ growisofs -Z /dev/hdc=file.iso
:-( unable to GET CONFIGURATION: Operation not permitted
:-( non-MMC unit?
Reverting back to 2.6.7 allows burning to work again. I've googled and
it would appear I'm not the only one with this.
Does anyone have any ideas why this would be happening?
