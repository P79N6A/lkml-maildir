Yes, that was my (weak) attempt at sarcasm.

Well, the problem I try to highlight here is as follows (for example):
a)
   - FSMlabs goes out of business
   - they owe money to creditors
   - creditors see patent as an asset to be sold to recoup some money
   - nasty company buys patent rights
b)
   - nasty company has lots of money, buys FSMlabs outright
- nasty company does not license patent for free to GPL software users
Now, like I said, IANAL, but it may be that the _license_agreement_
which allows one to use the patent is between FSMlabs and GPL software
users.  If the patent is transferred to the nasty company, wouldn't that
make the original license agreement = (void *)NULL?  The nasty company
may be under no obligation to have favourable (=free) license terms for
the patent.
If I tell someone "you can sleep in my basement for free" and then I
sell my house, I doubt the new house owners are under any obligation
to let that person stay in their basement for free, or at all.
Cheers, Andreas
