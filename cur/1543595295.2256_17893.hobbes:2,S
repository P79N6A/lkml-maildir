Hello,
i have a strange network problem with smbfs and my local network
I am connected(100Mbit) with my local Samba Server (192.168.0.1), mounted two 
shares. 
If I download something the network connections breaks radomly (the traffic 
slows down to zero).
!But I have no kernel messages and no messages in my Samba-Log-files.!
If I do a ping(or something similar) to the server the network is up, the 
download goes on.
I could reproduce this bug with kernel 2.4.5 and 2.4.4 but not with 2..4.3 
and 2.4.2. 
My network card is a Realtek 8139 (driver: 8139too)
With a ne2000-card (only 10Mbit) I could not reproduce this bug.
So I don't know if this is a problem with the network-driver or with smbf and 
100 Mbit network. 
There must be something with the changes between 2.4.3 and 2.4.4
For more information please contact me. This is my first bug report do not 
blame me so hard. ;-)
