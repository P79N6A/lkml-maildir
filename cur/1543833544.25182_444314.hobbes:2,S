Yeah, I had a headache from this mistake, I found it a few minutes
after sendig mail ;-)

I didn't know about div_sc32... Simply, I have no problem with using
div_sc32 now when I know that is exists ;-)

Good.

Maybe my test program is not as good as nanosleep_jitter :-)
I did patch against -hrt-dyntick (see lkml, this thread) wich is almost 
the same
as this one against -rt (for ixp4xx part only) and I found that when timer 
is
loaded with IXP4XX_OST_ONE_SHOT the latency time suddenly drops to ~30usec instead
of ~2000usec! I'd like know what's the reason for this...
Best regards,
Milan
