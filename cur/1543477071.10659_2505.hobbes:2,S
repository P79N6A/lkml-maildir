   Does the ext2 file system depend on /dev/hda5 staying /dev/hda5?
No; but it does depend on the starting location of /dev/hda5 staying
constant if you play partition renaming games.  This isn't always the
case with extended partitions, though, because of their really gross
nesty partition table structure, so you have to exercise a lot of care
when you move extended partitions around.  I generally will try very
hard to avoid extended partitions whenever posible.
