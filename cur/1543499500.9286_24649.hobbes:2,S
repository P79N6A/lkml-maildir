Yes, I know that. I just wasn't certain that it did not affect anything
else...
The configuration is: 66MHz mem (PC100 Dimm), 33MHz CPU, K6-200 CPU. Other
cards not in use, but here they are anyways:
PCI: WinTV PCI, SBLive, 100MBit networkcard with 21140 (-FA?) chip and afore
mentioned Symbios 876 (actually an Diamond Fireport 40 dual, with the
Symbios 4.14 bios on it, and nvram bytes 0 and 1 set to 0 to make it work.
Had some troubles with the diamond bios, you know, and diamond was to lazy
to answer)
ISA: Serial card for com 3&4, irq's shared with onboard ports and afore
mentioned RTL8019
Oh, and by the way, in kernels >2.2.5 I have the new symbios driver (as a
module via initrd)

No UDMA drives in use, so that can't be the cause...
I'll see if I have enough time to check things with some 2.1 kernel. I'll
let you know.
