Actually, I realised there's an easier way: provide a variant of
__journal_unfile_buffer() which doesn't clear jh->b_transaction.
That's a subtle change in the logic, but everywhere that is calling
this, we already hold various locks --- except for that elusive
bh_journal_head lock.
But since everywhere else is using _other_ locks, the transient state
where we're on the transaction but not on a list won't be visible ---
we'll have refiled before we drop the lock.
I think things should work just fine with this change.
__journal_unfile_buffer() already handles the case where we're called
with b_transaction set but no b_jlist, for example.
