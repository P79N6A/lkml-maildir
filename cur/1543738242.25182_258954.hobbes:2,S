Thats one reason I wanted sk_buff like rather than sk_buff. I want
to be able to recycle buffers back to drivers when the driver thinks
its the right thing to do.
Then you get something like
next_buffer()
{
	new_buf = tty->nextbuf;
	if(!new_buf)
		new_buf = grow_tty_buf(tty);
	queue_to_ldisc(tty->buf);
	tty->buf = newbuf;
}
and "free" most of the time can simply queue the buffer back to the tty.
That degenerates into flip buffers in good conditions..

Ethernet packets at 1500bytes arriving at 100Mbit is rather higher than
that, and the processing demands are higher too
