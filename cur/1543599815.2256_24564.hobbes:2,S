1. Do the pre patch first.
2. The rejects didn't make any difference.  init/main.c.rej was SCSI
hd[m-t] addresses which were easy to drop in by hand,
drivers/block/ide.c.rej was comments & spacing, and the others were in
Configure.help or Makefile EXTRAVERSION conflicts.  These don't matter
in most cases where the ide patch makes sense.
