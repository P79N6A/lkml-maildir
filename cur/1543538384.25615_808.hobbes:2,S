It is an 800MHz Athlon.  I have used a temperture probe
and it was always cool.  I have no idea on the dram timings.
But I didn't change anything there.
There are some of the BIOS settings:
***** SDRAM Timing *****

Well, it has pc100 dimms.  It is a Microstar MS6195 motherboard.
The L1/L2 caches are 128KB/512KB, but I don't know any more
about that.
