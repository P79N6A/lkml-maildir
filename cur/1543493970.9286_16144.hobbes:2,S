Xconfig is written basing on silent assumption that each variable should 
be defined in only one place. This assumption is broken in the
drivers/video/Config.in file, however...
For i386 architecture you can try my xconfig patch:
  
ftp://rudy.mif.pg.gda.pl/pub/People/ankry/linux-patches/2.2/xconfig/patch-xconfig-990407.gz
It fixes this problem partially ignoring most of options which cannot be
ever sellected for current architecture. 
However, for ppc/m68k/sparc/sparc64 the problem is more serious and cannot be 
removed in this way.
