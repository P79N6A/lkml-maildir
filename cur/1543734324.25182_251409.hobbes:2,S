Hello ALSA developers (cc: LKML for any inspiration),
Some snd-au8830 concerns..
I've recently been using my Aureal Vortex2 SQ2500 with ALSA's snd-au8830
to do some recording, and I got a humongous pile of these in my dmesg:
vortex: IRQ reg error
vortex: IRQ fifo error
vortex: IRQ dma error
and at the end of each batch:
vortex: 0 virt=0, real=0, delta=-1
Also, I can't seem to start up JACK using the ALSA backend:
loading driver ..
creating alsa driver ...
hw:0|hw:0|1024|2|48000|0|0|nomon|swmeter|-|32bit
control device hw:0
configuring for 48000Hz, period = 1024 frames, buffer = 2 periods
Couldn't open hw:0 for 32bit samples trying 24bit instead
Couldn't open hw:0 for 24bit samples trying 16bit instead
ALSA: cannot set period size to 1024 frames for capture
ALSA: cannot configure capture channel
cannot load driver module alsa
It only works when I use -p 512 (512 frames/period) and disable capture
outputs:
$ jackd -d alsa -p512 -P
creating alsa driver ... hw:0|-|512|2|48000|0|0|nomon|swmeter|-|32bit
control device hw:0
configuring for 48000Hz, period = 512 frames, buffer = 2 periods
Couldn't open hw:0 for 32bit samples trying 24bit instead
Couldn't open hw:0 for 24bit samples trying 16bit instead
It all works perfectly with my other machine which uses snd-intel8x0.
(Except, of course, that there's no nice hardware mixing.) Any ideas?
Thanks!
