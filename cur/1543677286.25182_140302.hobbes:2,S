I don't think I totally buy that argument.  Often a "carrier-grade" box has a 
whole bunch of things that must be running for the box to stay healthy.  If one 
of them dies, the system logs the problem along with diagnostic information and 
tries to restart it.  If it can't be restarted, then we failover to the warm 
standby and go for a reboot to try and clean things up.
I agree that there are other issues, but needing to have a particular binary 
running isn't really a problem. (init, for example...)
