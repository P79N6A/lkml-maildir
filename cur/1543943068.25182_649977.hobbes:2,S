I tried the patch, and the card was detected. I was able to associate
with an WPA2 AP and send/receive some traffic. But after a while the
interface broke:
ath0: No ProbeResp from current AP 00:14:bf:16:25:87 - assume out of
range
ath5k_hw_get_isr: 0x00000020
...
ath0: failed to set channel 165 (5825 MHz) for scan
ath0: failed to restore operational channel after scan
printk: 19 messages suppressed.
ath5k phy0: calibration timeout (2447MHz)
printk: 1 messages suppressed.
ath5k phy0: calibration timeout (2447MHz)
ath5k phy0: unable to reset hardware: -11
