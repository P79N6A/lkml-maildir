Yup.  Running the mirror doesn't matter really.  I start that before I
retire at the end of the day.

Where it gets me is the 2nd mirror I have on a usb disk.  Updating it takes
a while.  Although priming the cache on the machine where the usb disk is is
a bit quicker than where the mirror is (rsync over tcp/ip).  Both disks use
ext3, but the machine the usb is on has way more memory, usb2, and overall
quicker than the other.

I've been wanting to upgrade that machine to 768mb, but I don't know if
it'll handle it.
