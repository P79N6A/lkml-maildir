Endianess?  I guess a blanket statement saying that all constants are
stored little-endian enough (which is obvious, but its always good to be
explicit).

This is a bit confusing from an endian perspective.  Does the "HdrS"
notation mean that it is a byte array containing 'H', 'd', 'r', 'S', as
the string syntax suggests?  Or is that the ascii interpretation of each
byte of a 4-byte value read as a little-endian encoding from that location?

So the version is in BCD?

Chapter?  Is there a more specific reference you could make?

How about something like:
    This example is only valid if "setup_sects" is greater than
        ((0x1e00 - 0x200) / 0x200) = 14.
Just to make the calculation explicit.
