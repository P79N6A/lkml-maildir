... which is absolutely unusable for this particular purpose - the
touchscreen object is not going away when refcount is 0. The variable
shoudl be renamed to "users" or something. Moreover it needs locking.
Anyway, all of this will be handled by the input core very shortly so
it can be left as is for now.
As far as the driver goes:
- yes, it does need input_sync;
- I prefer using input_set_abs_params instead of setting mix, max,
flat and fuzz for each axis manually;
- I believe "/* .. */" is preferred over "//"
- kill the commented out bad prototypes.
Also, is there a way to query the screen for actual size?
