Well, rc2 had a Promise change. I'm not sure if it could be the cause, but 
lets check.

# [PATCH] PATCH: Promise cable
# 
# The old driver used to check .id was NULL to detect drive absent
# (which is wrong but generally worked) with the IDE changes it always
# got it wrong. This fixes it to test .present instead.
# 
# Without this fix it mistakenly assumes that the empty drive slot
