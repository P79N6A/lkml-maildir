I suppose the marker approach will be adopted if jumping from a marker
to code hooked up there can be made fast and secure enough for
prominent architectures.

Basically, I agree. But, the devel is in the details.
Dynamic instrumentation based on markers allows to grow code,
but it doesn't allow to grow data structure, AFAICS.
Statistics might require temporary results to be stored per
entity.
For example, latencies require two timestamps. The older one needs to
be stored somewhere until the second timestamp can be determined and
a latency is calculated. I would add a field a field to struct request
for this purpose.
The workaround would be to pass any intermediate result in the form
of a trace event up to user space and try to sort it out later -
which takes us back to the blktrace approach.
