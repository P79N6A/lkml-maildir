Borrow a copy of Stevens advanced unix programming and look at file handle
passing. Basically you can pass a file handle from one process to another
over a socket. Its an interesting and sadly underused unix feature.
For example a client could open a file and pass the handle to a server to
print. In your case you could open /dev/mem and pass it to a client.

For simple AGP addressing/management you should check the Matrox Gx00
3D list. I did them a basic DMA driver (dmaram.c in 2.2.10ac*) and they
have extended this to do virtual allocations and AGP mappings.
