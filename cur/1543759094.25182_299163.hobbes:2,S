Hi.
Here are the stats:
1GB P4, 2.6.11+Suspend2 2.1.8.
Soft image size limit set to 2MB to emulate Pavel's implementation (eat
as much memory as we can).
Without patch:
Freed  16545 pages in  4000 jiffies = 16.16 MB/s
Freed  83281 pages in 14060 jiffies = 23.14 MB/s
Freed 237754 pages in 41482 jiffies = 22.39 MB/s
With patch:
Freed  52257 pages in  6700 jiffies = 30.46 MB/s
Freed 105693 pages in 11035 jiffies = 37.41 MB/s
Freed 239007 pages in 18284 jiffies = 51.06 MB/s
With a less aggressive image size limit (200MB):
Without the patch:
Freed  14600 pages in  1749 jiffies = 32.61 MB/s (Anomolous!)
Freed  88563 pages in 14719 jiffies = 23.50 MB/s
Freed 205734 pages in 32389 jiffies = 24.81 MB/s
With the patch:
Freed  68252 pages in   496 jiffies = 537.52 MB/s
Freed 116464 pages in   569 jiffies = 798.54 MB/s
Freed 209699 pages in   705 jiffies = 1161.89 MB/s
The later pages take more work to get, which accounts for the slower
MB/s with smaller numbers of pages to free. Without the patch, though,
getting the easier pages also takes longer because we do a far greater
number of invocations of shrink_all_memory in order to get the same
number of pages.
Regards,
Nigel
