There were updates in 2.4.9-pre2 in the VIA driver, so it might be worth
trying. Also disabling CONFIG_IDEDMA_AUTO may work, but you'll get slow
performance. Afterwards, though, you can do hdparm -i /dev/hd* and cat
/proc/ide/via, which will tell us interesting information, which may
lead us further to solving the problem. Btw, what clock and multiplier
your CPU is?
