Hi,
I have been looking and searching the latest kernel pachecs and update for 
the fixes that were issued some time ago, but I have yet to see them.
The patches were issed by Henk De Groot and were as follows...

These were, I believe, issed against the 2.4.17 kernel.
These were to fix a lock up problem that I have encountered when useing an 
scc card and the scc utilites but might have been more general to ax25 use.
Have I missed something and they are there in the kernel now, haven't seen 
anything listed in the kernel changes or are these fixes being incorporated 
in the 2.5.xx series.
