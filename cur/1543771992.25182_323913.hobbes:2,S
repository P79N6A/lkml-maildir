Hi all,
I have some trouble using a memory stick of LG in my Athlon64 system. 
When I plug it in, dmesg gives messages like this:
ehci_hcd 0000:00:02.2: port 6 reset error -110
hub 1-0:1.0: hub_port_status failed (err = -32)
ehci_hcd 0000:00:02.2: port 6 reset error -110
hub 1-0:1.0: hub_port_status failed (err = -32)
hub 1-0:1.0: Cannot enable port 6.  Maybe the USB cable is bad?
and the stick cannot be mounted. It took some time of experimenting with 
different kernels to find out that
* using the 32-bit version of 2.6.8 or 2.6.11, the stick works fine, no 
error output!
* using the 64-bit version of 2.6.8 or 2.6.11, the problems occur as 
mentioned.
(2.6.8 as given by SuSE 9.2, 2.6.11 as by SuSE 9.3; both distributions 
offer a 32 and a 64-bit installation)
I also tried a Kubuntu 5.04 with 2.6.10, same result for 64 bit.
Does anybody have a good theory on what is happening here? Could this be 
a hardware problem?
Thanks for any hint,
Michael
