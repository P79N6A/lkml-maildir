Yes, we can.
Connector itself has quite enough information about it's registrants.
For example if it is somehow not good module( for example without GPL in
it's license string) then connector can be extended to call it's
callback from thread or in jail. If it is of interest I will think of
some plugable mechanism for callback environment( probably provide
->before_callback() and ->after_callback() methods from external policy
provider which may check callback data and/or confine callback execution
? ).
We also may confine closed modules from being able to use event
notification. In this scenario with worned out pwc-closed/open,
situation will not differ from what we have now.
