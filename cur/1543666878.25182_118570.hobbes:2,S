I'm getting quite a lot of audio skips with this one. 2.5.64-mm8 was the 
last one I tested and it was very good.
2.5.64-mm8 works fine with pretty much any thud load I throw at it, but thud 
3 is enough to cause some skips with 2.5.65-mm2. Thud 5 causes serious 
starvation problems to the whole desktop.
