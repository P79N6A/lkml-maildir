It should note, though, that -not- using CONFIG_ALPHA_GENERIC seems to
have a detrimental effect on my machines, in 2.4.5 vanilla.
When built with CONFIG_ALPHA_NAUTILUS, my UP1000's IDE totally fails. 
It probes the drives ok, on boot, but a logic hang occurs where no more
boot progress can be made.  All I get are "hda: lost interrupt"
messages.  I am booting w/ aboot 0.7a from SRM, -without- the
srm-as-bootloader kernel config option.  These problems go away when
using the generic MDK alpha kernel, which is based on Alan's '2.4.4-ac'
patchkit, and uses CONFIG_ALPHA_GENERIC.
A very similar problem occurs on my new test alpha, a miata.  With
CONFIG_ALPHA_MIATA, IDE fails with "hda: lost interrupt" as above, but
additionally, the keyboard is no longer recognized.  Again, with MDK(ac)
kernel, things work fine.
After wondering for a while what magic was in the 'ac' patchkit, I
realized that my build needed CONFIG_ALPHA_GENERIC to work.  Tested that
theory... sure enough, I can boot 2.4.5-vanilla no problems now.
