Hi Roman, Hi everybody else,
my boot problem is solved within kernel 2.6.18-rc1-mm2!!!
A thousands of thanks for all your efforts!
I have compared 18-rc1-mm1 and 18-rc1-mm2.
mm2 contains a patch for timer.c owning almost twice as many hunks than mm1.
In so far I was sure it was a timer.c issue.
Regards
Uwe
