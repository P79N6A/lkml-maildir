Hi,
for which kernel version is this patch usable?
I'm using gentoo-sources-2.6.17-gentoo-r8 (Linux 2.6.17.13).
My phone is a P990i and not a M600i but they are very similar.
I changed the Vendor ID from 0xe031 to 0xe030 and "M600i" to "P990i" and 
inserted the lines starting with "+" to my unusual_devs.h but I still can't see 
partitions on /dev/sda.
Maybe the problem is that I don't have this section:
       US_SC_DEVICE, US_PR_DEVICE, NULL, 
       US_FL_NO_WP_DETECT ),
in line 1257?
