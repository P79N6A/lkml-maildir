Unfortunately it is not updated version of Jaya's patch but the updated version
of the original 2.6.x patch and it misses 2 iterations of bugfixes/cleanups:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-ide&m=112832700817260&w=2
From what I see the main differences between _original_ patch and this one are:
* /proc/ide/cs5535 (sorry but new /proc bloat won't be accepted)
* different way of setting PIO command timings
  (but this method won't ever set timings > 0 if initially timings were bad)
* trusting BIOS to set correct mode also on drive's side (this breaks Power
  Management support and I will prefer to have known state from Linux POV)
It would be the best to join efforts so could somebody from AMD take a look
at Jaya's latest patch and read related linux-ide ML thread?
Thanks,
Bartlomiej
