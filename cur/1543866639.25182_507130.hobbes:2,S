I would disagree that it's a peripheral issue, it's pretty core these 
days, at least for any hardware that you can stuff in a laptop (though a 
fair number of desktops get suspended and resumed these days too). One 
driver on a system which doesn't suspend or resume properly can ruin the 
entire process, causing a ton of user frustration. Certainly I would 
consider a driver without suspend/resume support to be incomplete.
The trouble with deferring adding this support is that it's a lot harder 
to add this support in after the fact than if it was considered during 
the original driver development.
I would be in favor of not merging drivers lacking suspend unless 
there's a very good reason they're lacking it.
It also kind of bothers me that if a driver has no suspend/resume 
functions, and you suspend and resume the system, we don't complain 
about it even though there's a very good chance that device is not going 
to function properly. How about something in dmesg like:
Warning: driver for device XXXX has no suspend or resume support.
Device may not function properly after resume.
so that users know who to complain to. Maybe there are some devices that 
truly don't need any handling for suspend, but if so I suspect the 
number of those is small enough that adding empty functions would be a 
good-enough solution.
