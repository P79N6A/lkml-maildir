OK.

Yeah, true.

down_write/up_write, but yes, I'll change that to a mutex.  The card_rwsem was 
previously subsystem.rwsem, but that went away.

Sure, I'll do that... all those uppercase letters hurt my eyes, though.

Ugh, yeah, I don't know why I keep doing that...

Oh, ok, I can clean that up.

These bitfields aren't used on the wire or anywhere outside the driver... what 
the problem? Perfomance?

Do you have an alternative suggestion here?  I need to take a sub-list of the

sublist, but it's pretty pointless since I have both ends of the sublist.

Yeah... I'll sit down and try to document it better.
