Hi,
I am reading some data from a file byte by byte in my driver. Although it's not a good thing to read a file in the driver I have to do it. My file is quite big can contain about 1000 lines each line containing anywhere from 0 to 500 characters. I believe carry out 500000 reads is not a good thing. 
Any suggestions on how I can improve ??
Thanks and Regards,
David
