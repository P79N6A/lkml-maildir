stored in partition table. And for correct boot you NEED them to be consistent
with BIOS imagination about disk. So nightmares are just slightly moved, not
ended :-/

And this "except" is root of all problems: you MUST have proper information
stored in partition table.

You are lucky then :-) I had such problems even with SCSI disks where such
problems should be non-existent "by definition". They are exists and REALLY
annoying :-/
