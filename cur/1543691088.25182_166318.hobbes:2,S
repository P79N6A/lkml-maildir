No, this is even true with the current select.

'select' adds a reverse dependency to the selected option, e.g.
config FOO
	select BAR if BAZ
BAR has now a reverse dependency of "FOO && BAZ" and the value of BAR is 
calculated as "(user value && visibility) || reverse dependency" 
(visibility is the dependencies of all BAR prompts). The details are in 
symbol.c:sym_calc_value().
This allows to calculate the configuration in a single pass and as a side 
effect avoids inconsistencies.
bye, Roman
