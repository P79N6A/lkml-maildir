Al, 
Have you added Chris Mason patch to SetPageDirty in mark_buffer_dirty() &
related changes to your -bird tree ? 
Also, would you accept a patch to remove mark_buffer_dirty() (and use
__mark_buffer_dirty() and balance_dirty only after unlock_super()) from
places with superblock lock held in ext2?
