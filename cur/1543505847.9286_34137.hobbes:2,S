I tried to deactivate everything, but even in single user mode and
no process or daemon running, I get disk I/O. Yes it stops after a
while, but a simple 'ls' triggers new activity even if all is in
cache already (ls finished and a second later the disk i/o happens). 
Perhaps this is some timestamp business, and how can I hope to patch
every user land command to avoid it? With mobile-update you can
edit, compile, run programs without any disk i/o. 
The idea of mobile-update is to avoid writing of dirty buffers, when
there is no recent disk i/o. Sure, this bears some risk, but if it
gives you 20% more battery life you might accept it.  If you're
scared that the battery might drop, you can sync by hand.
Cheers, Peter
