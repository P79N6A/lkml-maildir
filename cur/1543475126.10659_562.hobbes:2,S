Agreed, I found that interesting too. The solution may just be to make
kswapd run a lot less often rather than removing it - for the
machine-killing out-of-memory situation it doesn't matter if kswapd runs
just a few times a second or something like that. 
However, one of the things I found so appealing with the patch was the
fact that it removed a lot of code, and that wouldn't be true for
something that just changed kswapd to run less often. Oh, well.
