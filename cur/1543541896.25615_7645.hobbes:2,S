That probably wasn't the brightest choice to make...
There are patches out there which make this behaviour a little more
sensible, though - e.g. kill the process which has grabbed the most memory
recently, to kill off things which go into a leaking loop (Netscape does
this a lot...).

A nice daemon to keep an eye on things memory-wise would make a big
difference; someone wrote one a few months ago during the nuclear flamewar
over "overcommit". The most common problem of this sort is probably an app
"going rogue", and grabbing lots of RAM; you couldn't react fast enough to
this, but a nice -20 daemon probably could. Failing that, an "intelligent"
kernel-side killer can still reduce the fallout when the system goes
bang...

That would just make matters a bit worse: you'd run out of memory a bit
sooner, but still end up with things dying more or less at random. What is
really needed is proper resource accounting - which is currently an
optional patch out there somewhere. (Try searching the l-k archives for
"beancounter", IIRC?)
