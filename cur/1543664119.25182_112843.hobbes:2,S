Patch looks pretty good, thanks.  Fixes a real bug.
I worry a little about the s390/s390x change.  smp_ctl_set_bit() and
smp_ctl_clear_bit().  The functions which are being called on local and
remote are fairly different.  I'm sure it's OK, but...  I changed that bit
to open-code the preempt_disable/enable.
The arch/x86_64/kernel/bluesmoke.c change looks right.  Seems that someone
didn't understand the smp_call_function() API in there.
