Yes that can happen, but if they check for rcu_pending right after that
it will prevent them from going tickless atleast (which will prevent grace
periods from being unnecessarily extended). Something like below:
	CPU0					CPU1
	rcp->cur++;	/* New GP */		
	smp_mb();
	rsp->cpumask = 0x3
						cpu_set(1, nohz_cpu_mask);
						rcu_pending()? 
						 - Yes,
						   cpu_clear(1, nohz_cpu_mask);
						   Abort going tickless
Ideally we would have needed a smp_mb() in CPU1 also between setting CPU1
in nohz_cpu_mask and checking for rcu_pending(), but I guess it is not needed
in s390 because of its strong ordering?
