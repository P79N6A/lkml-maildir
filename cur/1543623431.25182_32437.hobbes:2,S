   | If you acquired your memory via the page allocator
   | (i.e. __get_free_page*()) or the generic memory allocators
   | (i.e. kmalloc() or kmem_cache_alloc()) then you may DMA to/from
   | that memory using the addresses returned from those routines.
   
   	It might be a good idea to rephrase it.  If I knew what that
   sentence I would propose a patch to the DMA-mapping.txt file, but I
   honestly don't know what proposition that sentence is supposed
   to convey.  If there really is no guarantee that this sentence is
   conveying, then I guess the sentence should be deleted.
Probably it should qualify what it means with "and you used
GFP_KERNEL".  Because that was the intention.
I'll fix that.
However, you can use GFP_HIGH memory with pci_map_page _iff_
you set your DMA mask to allow 64-bits.
The original impetus for that quoted bit of DMA-mapping.txt
was to make sure nobody used vmalloc() or kmap() pointers.
