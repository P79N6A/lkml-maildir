I've got a little pb with the system V ipc.
The configuration of my system is:
"ipcs -l" gives me:
------ Shared Memory Limits --------
max number of segments = 128
max seg size (kbytes) = 32768
max total shared memory (kbytes) = 16777216
min seg size (bytes) = 1
------ Semaphore Limits --------
max number of arrays = 128
max semaphores per array = 32
max semaphores system wide = 4096
max ops per semop call = 32
semaphore max value = 32767
------ Messages: Limits --------
max queues system wide = 128
max size of message (bytes) = 4056
default max size of queue (bytes) = 16384
I would like to grow-up the default max size of queue (bytes) to 65536.
How can i do ?
I try to change the kernel-source but it doesn't work fine!!!!!
PS: I hope my question is not so stupid and thanks for all answers.
