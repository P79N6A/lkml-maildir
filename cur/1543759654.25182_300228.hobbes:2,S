IMHO, it's probably better to modify your patch to use 
ipmi_request_settime.  That function is there is all recent kernels.  
Unfortunately, I can't magically re-add the ipmi_request function to 
2.6.11, and it would be less confusing to have a new patch for 
bmcsensors that worked with stock 2.6.11.
Again, sorry about this.
