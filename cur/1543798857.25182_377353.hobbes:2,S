Subject: [PATCH 2/5] - Tuner 100 was absent in tveeprom
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/12/18/44

- Tuner 100 is the TUNER_PHILIPS_FMD1216ME_MK3, not TUNER_ABSENT. This
was causing the tuner module to be skipped, and rendered boards with this
value in the eeprom (like the HVR1100) unable to tune
