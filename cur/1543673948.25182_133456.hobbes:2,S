putc() is almost never called, IIRC. We did our best to combine as much data as
possible and call putcs().
A quick grep showed ->con_putc() is called only in drivers/char/vt.c for:
  - Complementing the pointer position (for gpm)
  - Inserting/deleting single characters
  - Softcursor
I guess the small overhead won't have much influence here.
