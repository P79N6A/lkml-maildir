Not what I said ... that's what the _driver_ usually wants to do,
which is different from the step implemented by set_mwi(). 
What Alan Cox said is a better paraphrase:
> MWI is an "extra cheese" option not a "no pizza" case
Or "sorry, that car is not available in olive, just burgundy."
Not:

You mis-understand.  It's completely legit for the driver not to care.
I agree that set_mwo() should set MWI if possible, and fail cleanly
if it couldn't (for whatever reason).  Thing is, choosing to treat
that as an error must be the _driver's_ choice ... it'd be wrong to force
that policy into the _interface_ by forcing must_check etc.
