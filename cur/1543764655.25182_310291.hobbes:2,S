What good does it do if you can revalidate the original B1? The important 
point is that the end result works and if it only fails in the merged 
version you have a big problem. The serialized version gives you the 
chance to test whether it fails in B1 or B2.

The merge result has to be tested either way, so I'm not exactly sure, 
what you're trying to say.
