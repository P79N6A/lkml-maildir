Access beyond end of skb is officially allowed, within 16 bytes
in <= 2.2, withing 64 bytes in  >=2.4. Moreover, it is not only allowed
but highly recommended, when this can ease coding.

Well, not depending on wrong accent put by you, the change is not useless.

PS Gentlemen, it is not so bad idea to change subject and to trim cc list.
Thread is went to area straight orthogonal to TSO, csum_partial is not
used with TSO at all. :-)
