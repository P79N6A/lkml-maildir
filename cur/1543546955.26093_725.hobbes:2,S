Subject: problems with modules in test6 and test7 kernels

It appears that something is different in the way modules are started in the
test6 and test7 kernels.  When I boot to one of these kernels, I get lots of
module errors and my machine locks up mid-boot.
I use Debian, and I suspect perhaps Debian's way of making kernel packages
does not yet know how to cope with the changes.
Is there some place where I can RTM and find out what is going on?
The documentation that comes with the test kernel did not answer my questions.
I have no problem booting to test kernel 5 so this is something that just
changed in test6 kernel.
thanks
