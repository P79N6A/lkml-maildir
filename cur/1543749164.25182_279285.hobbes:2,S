Yes.  I've tried this out, and it works OK, but it isn't pleasing.  One
of the main problems is that the stack is likely to be above 4G, so %esp
has no useful value, and when you switch to 64-bit mode, the top 32-bits
of %rsp become undefined.

Well, if they've got code which is already switching between 32 and 64
bit segments, then they need to cope with either cs being current at
delivery time.

At syscall time, rather than delivery time, I assume.  Hm, I'd prefer it
if it didn't look at the current segment, but at the syscall path.  Ie,
installing a handler with __NR_rt_sigaction via int 0x80 (or 32-bit
syscall/sysenter) should set up a 32-bit frame on delivery, but if the
handler was installed with the 64-bit syscall, it should be called with
a 64-bit frame.

I'll take a look.
