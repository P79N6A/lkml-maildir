The only time that I've had this kind of problem (that I recall),
I just had to use a KERN_printklevel attribute to print the message.
E.g.,
	printk(KERN_CRIT "where does this message go\n");
It can also help to change the console loglevel (Alt-SysRq-N, where
N is 1 digit, higher prints more messages [try 9]).
and what kernel version?  You should always give that info,
even when it's useless.  :)
