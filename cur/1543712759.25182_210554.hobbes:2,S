Do you have enough evidence that it's the very same bug?
I believe there were other loopholes in the original objrmap code,
we've both moved on from there (e.g. we both decided it's safer to
set and clear PageAnon inside the maplock), so I'm not concerned
about the original objrmap.

Yes, I'm not talking about page_add_rmap on the zero page, but
about how with pageable 0 you skip page_add_rmap of copy of zero page.

Yes, repeat sentence above.

Perhaps that's in a different version than I'm looking at, 2.6.5-rc2-aa5.

Where does "pageable" get set to 1 in do_no_page's COW case?

It'll get a page which is !PageReserved !PageAnon !page->mapping.

Er, probably not.  I may be wrong, but you're not convincing me.
Go slower, read my mail and read your code, then explain where
"pageable" gets set to 1 if do_no_page is COWing the zero page.
