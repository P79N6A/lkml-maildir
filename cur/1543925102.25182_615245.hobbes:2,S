848A is the preferred configuration value
The use of 044A is also allowed in the case of it being non-removable.
Guess someone got muddled up in the middle.
844A is a bit iffy and it should still be detectable as Word 83 bit 2
should be set ?
As to the old IDE (not libata ?) issue - I suspect a convertor without
DMA support as a first guess.
