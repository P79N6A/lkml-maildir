It is a simple pain/benefit issue.
Fixing the 25 errors and 13 warnings in kernel/profile.c may look
like an easy task but then we put additional burden on the 10 people
that have patches pending for this file.
It is the same reason why we do not run a 'kill-trailing-whitespace'
on the full kernel tree.
