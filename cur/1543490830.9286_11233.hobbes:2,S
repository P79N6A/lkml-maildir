Which is the problem?
The only place that reuse the buffer is placed in the freelist is getblk
here:
[..]
	bh = free_list[isize];
	if (!bh)
		goto refill;
	remove_from_free_list(bh);
	/* OK, FINALLY we know that this buffer is the only one of its kind,
	 * and that it's unused (b_count=0), unlocked, and clean.
	 */
	init_buffer(bh, dev, block, end_buffer_io_sync, NULL);
[..]
And look at init_buffer():
[..]
void init_buffer(struct buffer_head *bh, kdev_t dev, int block,
		 bh_end_io_t *handler, void *dev_id)
{
	bh->b_count = 1;
	^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
	bh->b_list = BUF_CLEAN;
[..]
Also after get_unused_buffer_head there is a b_count = 0 (that btw, looks
like not needed to me because a bh-header in the unused_list will be
zeroed for sure).
Maybe I missing something...
