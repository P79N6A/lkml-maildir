sincerely i can notice that task and application switching is a bit slower.
i have a 500mhz cpu so i think i can notice a bit the difference.
i can't estimate it mmm...
i'll say no more that 5-8%.
but i don't know where i'm gaining speed..
however i'm not using battery, this is not laptop so i can't report  that.
i'm sorry.
