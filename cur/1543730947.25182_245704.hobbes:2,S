Yes.  In some cases the compression or re-archiving algorithm would
choose different parameters, depending on the alignment capabilities
of the underlying filesystem.  In some cases, that alignment is
"offset 0 is the only one you can have", which is a severe special
case where truncate and rewrite is required for changes.

Nice.  That's useful for files which appear as themselves and also as
part of a container.
And also for revision managed filesystems :)
