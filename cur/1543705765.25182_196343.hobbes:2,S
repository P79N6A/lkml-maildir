It's a bit of software (Subversion) built using "make -j4".  It
consists of a little over 200 C files compiled to object code, then
linked to about a dozen shared libraries, and finally linked to create
over a dozen executables.  It uses libtool, so each compile/link
involves running a bit of shell code before runing gcc.  It lends
itself to parallel builds, on 2.4 there is little difference in the
build time using -j2, -j4, -j8.  The source code is about 16MB and the
object/library/executable about 28MB.

Your patch doesn't apply to plain 2.6.2.  I got 2.6.2-mm1 and it looks
like that already includes your patch, correct?  This is what I got
for 2.6.2-mm1
247.02user 118.33system 3:51.24elapsed 157%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 0maxresident)k
0inputs+0outputs (176major+3771994minor)pagefaults 0swaps
so it's not really an improvement on plain 2.6.2.
