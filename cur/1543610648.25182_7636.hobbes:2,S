I think you hit the nail on the head here.  2.<even>.x kernels are not
stable, they are presumably stable.  Nothing is stable until it proves
itself.
If you run a hours-old kernel on a production machine, you will get
burned sooner or later.  If you run an hours-old kernel on a production
machine, and manage to reboot it so quickly, I start to wonder what kind
of "production" you're running.
