I never really thought of it as a device driver but rather an architecture
extension, so it started out in arch/ppc64/kernel. Since most of the code
is interacting with VFS, it is now in fs/spufs. I don't really care about
the location, but I among the possible places to put the code (with the
unified arch/powerpc tree), I'd suggest (best first)
1) arch/powerpc/platforms/cell
2) arch/powerpc/spe
3) fs/spufs
4) drivers/spe
1) would be the place where I want to have the low-level code
(currently arch/ppc64/kernel/spu_base.c) anyway, so it makes
sense to have everything in there that I maintain.
2) might work better if we at a later point have multiple platform
types in arch/powerpc that use SPEs, e.g if we want to keep 
Playstation code separate from generic Cell.
