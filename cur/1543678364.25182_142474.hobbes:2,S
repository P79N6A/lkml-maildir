Are the benchmarks that show gcc 3.3 to be much slower at compile time
being done with a natively compiled gcc 3.3?  I.E. gcc 3.3 compiled
with itself?
When I upgraded a few machines from 2.95.3 to 3.2.3, I noticed that
the last of the three compiles, (I.E. a gcc-3.2.3 compiled gcc-3.2.3
compiling the gcc-3.2.3 source), was noticably quicker than the first
two, to the extent that it was easily mesaurable by a wall clock.
I am just wondering whether there gcc-3.X binaries in use that were
compiled with gcc-2.95.3, that are swaying benchmarks in favour of
2.95.3 compiled with itself.
I haven't benchmarked gcc-2.95.3 compiled with gcc-3.2.3, though.
John.
