I completely agree.  My Mac PowerBook has had suspend-to-RAM for a  
long time; I shut the lid and about 3 seconds later it's asleep, open  
it and 3 seconds later it's awake.  Leave it sleeping for a week on a  
full charge, come back to find it still asleep.  I can even put it to  
sleep, remove a drained battery and put in a fresh one (it has a  
small internal 2-minute RAM battery), then wake it up and resume  
work.  I'm curious though, what proportion of laptop hardware  
actually has support for suspend-to-RAM?  (including hardware for  
which linux does not yet have support).  What percent of that  
hardware _does_ have Linux support?
Cheers,
