well, in a nutshell, the problem scenario is that it's entirely
possible to have a modern distro (say, fedora 8, like i'm using) on
which you have the latest "rpm" package installed, but not "rpmbuild".
at which point scripts/package/Makefile, based on this:
RPM := $(shell if [ -x "/usr/bin/rpmbuild" ]; then echo rpmbuild; \
                   else echo rpm; fi)
will select "rpm" as the value of the variable RPM, at which point
things go south in a hurry as soon as you try to build an rpm package
using $(RPM) aka "rpm".
perhaps a solution would be to have two variables -- RPM and RPMBUILD
-- and set them appropriately based on what the Makefile finds.  and,
of course, whine incessantly if you have an unworkable setup.
anyway, have at it.
