Hi,
Has anyone backported the recent shared mmap page writeback fix 
(7658cc289288b8ae7dd2c2224549a048431222b3) to 2.6.18 or previous?
It looks like there will be at least one more 2.6.18-stable release and 
I'd like to see it fixed there.
I don't know enough about the VM layer to understand this further, but 
the real "problem" in simply backporting the patch seems to be in this part:
+		if (page_mkclean(page))
+			set_page_dirty(page);
page_mkclean did not exist in 2.6.18. Is there a simple solution or 
should backporting the commit with added page_mkclean 
(d08b3851da41d0ee60851f2c75b118e1f7a5fc89) be considered instead? 
Hopefully that one has no other dependencies...
Thanks!
Daniel
