Ok. That was just a thought.
Looks like the same problem was also reported twice on linux-kernel
Both while running cdrecord -scanbus with the usb-storage driver, but
not the aha152x driver  (References:
<20040106174755.GA8855@paradigm.rfc822.org>
<1075241217.3851.8.camel@localhost.localdomain>).
Your report and those two all involve sg.  So I guess the problem is in
sg (or an upper layer).
