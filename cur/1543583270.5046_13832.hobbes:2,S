Through the evidence I gave.  
Firstly, if the receiving side is saying that it has a window of 0, then
it is not going to accept any more data.
Secondly, the receiving side has data waiting in the receive queue.
Thirdly, the receiving process is selecting on the socket, and dispite
there being data waiting, select is saying that there is no data waiting.
All the data is pointing at the 2.4 kernel as being the culprit.
I'm surprised at your response given the amount of hard evidence I gave that
supports my assertion.
