Hi Everybody,
I have to use POSIX Message Queues (mq_open),Semaphores and Shared Memory in
Red Hat Linux 9.0 which is having Linux Kernel 2.4. 
I searched the net and looked out that I need to upgrade my Kernel [default
2.4.20 with Linux 9.0] to 2.6 to work with these as it supports NPTL and
compatible with POSIX1.b, whereas Linux 2.4 doesn't fully supports POSIX
standards.
Please guide me what other libraries and settings needs to be done in
Kernel2.6 to compile and execute my C code to work with NPTL which is
POSIX1.b Standards compliant.
Regards
Dinesh
