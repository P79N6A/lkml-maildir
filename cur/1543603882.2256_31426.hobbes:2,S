I checked yesterday the memory with memtest86, no errors, and i don't
think the problem is caused by some bad blocks. Using another disk, which
contains and ext3 partition, gave me another strange error (different from
the ext2 one i posted to the list) with the ide drive handling, and it
appeared only one time. So i think the guess that the problem is caused by
the power supply is right..., so i'll get a new one and let's see if the
problem doesn't show anymore ;)
Thanks
