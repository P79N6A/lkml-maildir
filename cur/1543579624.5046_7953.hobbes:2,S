Subject: Modules not being found with 2.4.0 on a 486 based box

Please cc: me as well, as I'm on to many lists as is. . .
Irecently built 2.4.0 on two diferent x486 PCs and neither of them
recognised the new module directory structure found in the 2.4.x
kernels.  I did not have this problem on the Pentium and better
machines that I built this same kernel on.  I got around the problem
by making a symlink from where the module actually was
(/lib/modules/2.4.0/kernel/drivers/net/) to where the system was
looking for it (/lib/modules/2.4.0/net/) and all is well. . .for now. 
I was wondering if there was any light that could be shed on why this
might happen?  I have only found this to be a problem on 486s,
everything bigger has worked fine.  Details below:
Feature		Working		Not Wotking
Processor	Pentium +	486 (486DX2-66, 486DX-50)
Distrobution	Debian unstable	Debian stable (unstable caused other
problems)
RAM		16Mb +		16Mb +
Hdd size	1Gb +		540Mb +
Modules involved Any		network cards (that is all I was using)
More info can be provided if needed.  This is low priority, I was
wondering if you had any ideas why (or how to get around it, other
than my solution).
Thank you all for your time, and for producing a kernel that is worth
all this work <grin>.
