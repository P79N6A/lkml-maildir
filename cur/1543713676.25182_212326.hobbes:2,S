Bart,
You're patch does the trick, I can now do cat /proc/ide/hpt366 without
any problems.  Time to re-sync my md mirror.
I'll also pull this patch forward to 2.6.5 and make sure to submit it
to Linus/Andrew, unless you'll do that part?
I do wish the cable detection stuff worked though... too bad about the
outb() stuff.  Maybe I can poke at it and figure out what kind of
locking is required here to make this work right.  Would it need to be
queued up as a regular HWIF command?  Can you tell I don't know what
I'm talking about?  *grin*
Thanks again,
John
