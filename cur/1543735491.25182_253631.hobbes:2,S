Subject: [Patch][RFC] conflicting device major numbers in devices.txt

Hi all,
some month ago a change to Documentation/devices.txt was submitted by John 
Cagle. 
http://linux.bkbits.net:8080/linux-2.6/cset
%4040586a32fpYGPUC8ysFeU7GIfmmdUA
The patch changed the major number of the s/390 dasd devices from 94 to 95. 
As you can see in include/major.h and drivers/s390/block/dasd.c the change 
to the documentation was bogus. The dasd device driver was using and will 
be using major number 94. 
Unfortunately, the "Inverse NAND Flash Translation Layer", which was added 
somewhen during 2.5 now uses the same major number.
I attached a patch to restore the old state but I am not sure, how to deal 
with the inftla driver. 
Patch to restore the old state
