We'll also need a libv4l2-vendorstuff then (*one* libary for *all* these
vendor formats), otherwise that isn't going to work.  If someone is
willing to create & maintain such a library -- fine with me.  I'll
happily hand out v4l2 vendor format ID's and agree do drop stuff from
kernel space then.  But asking the apps to decode stuff in userspace
without providing a way to do so isn't a good idea.
