Subject: [PATCH] Fix ZERO_OR_NULL_PTR(ZERO_SIZE_PTR)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/7/20/334

The comparison with ZERO_SIZE_PTR in ZERO_OR_NULL_PTR() needs to be <=
(not just <) so that ZERO_OR_NULL_PTR(ZERO_SIZE_PTR) is 1.

I finally had time to reproduce Michael's crash and debug it.  Linus's
patch is part of the story -- it doesn't help unless ZERO_OR_NULL_PTR()
is true.  With this change the crash goes away, and it seems pretty
obviously correct to me (unless I'm seriously confused).
