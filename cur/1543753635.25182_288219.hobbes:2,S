The PNGs are being generated with transparent background. The checkered
background is just being added as a visual helper artifact (or sort of) on
some graphics viewers (notably the ones which names start with "g" :).
It's in jack_test3_plot.sh where the explicit option to render it
transparent is. Just look for "transparent" and get rid of it, if you like
:)
BTW, as joq has already hinted, I have almost ready here a new test suite
(jack_test4), which features an actual (i.e.audible) audio chain instead
of just CPU eaters, as on the jack_test3 set.
Right now I'm merging the corrections joq handed to me yesterday, and will
post it here later toiday.
Cheers.
