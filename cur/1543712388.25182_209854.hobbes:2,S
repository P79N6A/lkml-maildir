As Andrew Zabolotny commented, NFS _does_ work today from those
devices.  Except that it doesn't work to MS-Windows hosts, unless
they've been taught other parts of the protocol stack.
Presumably Samba over RNDIS would work from Windows, but that
would need extra work from many Linux hosts.  Tradeoffs...

Well, PTP should take less memory inside the device/gadget than
a network stack, though it'd be less flexible.  And there's
also something to be said for less code in the kernel, and a
simpler device setup model ... especially for the kinds of
products that'd be considering something like PTP.
But I think the basic answer to your question is probably just
that nobody's yet written, or at least submitted, PTP client
or server kernel code for Linux.
