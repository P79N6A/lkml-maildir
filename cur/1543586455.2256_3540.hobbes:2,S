According to the kernel soruces, _mmx_memcpy is only defined when
Athlon is selected...
I noticed that you are using GCC 2.96... Is this the latest one that
Redhat recommends you update in order to build the kernel?  I forget,
something like GCC 2.96-79.
I have a similar setup at home... I'll try the new nVidia drivers
tonight and see how it goes.
