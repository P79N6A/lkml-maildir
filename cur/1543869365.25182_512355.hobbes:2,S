If you can find a way to do this without additional tunables burden on
the administrator that would certainly help ! IIRC, performance problems
linked to having too many or too few AIO kernel threads has been a commonly
reported issue elsewhere - it would be nice to be able to avoid repeating
the crux of that (mistake) in Linux. To me, any need to manually tune the
number has always seemed to defeat the very benefit of adaptability of varying
loads that AIO intrinsically provides.
