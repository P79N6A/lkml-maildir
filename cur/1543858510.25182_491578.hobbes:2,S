One important question is:
Who gets in danger due to this grey area?
E.g. if I'd consider it important enough to stop Ubuntu from 
distributing kernels and binary-only modules, I wouldn't try the 
difficult task to take legal actions against a company located on the 
Isle of Man.
The trick is to let a lawyer send cease and desist letters to people 
distributing the infringing software for 1 Euro at Ebay.
The nice thing about cease and desist letters is that the one who 
accepts one has to pay the > 1000 Euro costs for the lawyer for this 
letter.
Another lucrative task for the lawer would be to send cease and desist 
letters to people running mirrors located in Germany distributing the 
infringing software.
