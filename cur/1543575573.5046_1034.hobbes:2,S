Hmmm... Because of broken devices you move the burden to fine ones. Let me
disagree here.

I donnot see in what pci_enable_device() knows better than the tailored
software driver about what is to enable for the device and what must not
or should not. And, btw, when pci_enable_device() was born, it just
shoe-horned latency timer 64 if it was lower that 16 and I didn't want to
use so obviously loose in the first place interface.

Blacklists are there to preserve simplicity and genericity for compliant
devices and it has the advantage of showing in a single place what and how
these devices are broken.
On the other hand, I donnot see `pci_enable_device()' in latest 2.2
kernels. It seem to beleive that the millions Linux used around the world
are rather 2.2 that 2.4. All these buggy PCI devices breaking millions of
Linux 2.2 kernels should make some noise. What did I miss here?

Making driver for Linux work has been a nightmare for years, especially
PCI-SCSI, due to limitations and brokenness of related kernel services.

The driver is not calling pci_enable_device() but is does not change
anything by default for Intel (the only one I support personnaly) if it is
provided with a correct configuration. I have used it on various Intel
platforms, even without SDMS BIOS and the only configuration item I have
seen missing sometimes has been the offending PCI cache line size.
When the driver has been tinked (not by me) in order to run on non Intel
platforms, I am been provided with various ugly PCI-related hacks that I
have incorporated with appropriate #ifdef(s), since I couldn't even test
them.
If now, the PCI stuff is claimed to be cleaned up, then _all_ the hacks
have to be removed definitely.
As a result, the driver will not work anymore on Sparc64, neither on PPC
and I am not sure it will still work on Alpha, in my opinion.
