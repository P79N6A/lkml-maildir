These are my suggestions for the Draft Press Release,
version "fork 1, final-2" posted by Kyle Rose.
The PR is looking pretty good now.  The only pervasive problem it still
has is a tendency to overuse of "hype" words and prolix constructions.
(How many times should "widely" appear in the PR?  Is "has the ability
to" really better than "can"?) 
Each patch below is has a bit of explanatory text after it.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  I still maintain that saying "major new version" in one sentence and
  "update" in the next is confusing to readers who won't know what the
  press release is about.  Which is it, a major new version or an update?  
  People shouldn't have to wonder that while they try to decide whether 
  to toss it in the trash.  Some of the people who will be parroting 
  from this are _not_ very smart.  Let's not confuse them.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  Lots of fixes above; a grammatical problem: does "a wide variety"
  apply only to "protocols", or also to "accounting" etc.?  
  Replace "give the ability to" with "let"; clean up the description
  of devices ("many" begs the question "which ones?"): can Linux only
  replace proprietary-protocol devices?  I added "from outside the 
  U.S." to explain why encryption is an add-on, and not just included.  
  In the next paragraph I removed "positioned as": it's not "positioned 
  as" being ready, it _is_ ready.  ("Positioning" is marketing flim-flam.)
  I changed "is" to "remains" to avoid implying that previous versions 
  were not Y2K-ready.  Finally, I added a hyphen before "ready".

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  I added hyphens here and in a few other places.  Generally, when 
  a noun is part of an adjectival phrase (e.g. "port", "end") it needs
  a hyphen before it.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  I don't know what it means to "seamlessly handle data", but I do know 
  what "full access" means.  I added "and network services" to point out 
  that Linux can also (e.g.) mount SMB shares.  I added "transparently" 
  to imply that the rest of the network doesn't have to change.  (This 
  distinguishes it from Netware, which can do the same sorts of things as 
  NT Server, but not transparently.)  I replaced "gives ... the ability 
  to" with "With ... can" because it's simpler.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  Again, I removed "has the ability to" replacing it with "can".   
  I replaced "submit patches to" with "send in improvements for" because 
  only programmers know what patches are.  I replaced "facilitates" with
  "eases" for obvious reasons.  I replaced "enables users to repair 
  problems within hours" with "lets users repair problems immediately"
  (why should we have to wait "hours"?).
  The sentence about the worldwide network of mirror servers was far too
  ponderous for its subject (Is the sentence about downloading, or about 
  anticipating a heavy load?)  I split it up.   Also, few people know
  what a mirror server is, though they can figure out download, hence
  the quote marks.  We have to say "mirror" so they know what to look
  for on the web site.  Maybe some improvements are still possible here.

  "Widely", again?  I replaced it with "readily".

  This is just a formatting change.  We should try to make sure the
  text portion (if not the list of URLs at the bottom) reads cleanly
  when printed out even with URLs expanded.
