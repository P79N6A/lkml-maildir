The first wake-one patch floating around was against 2.2.x waitqueues and
it's a very simple patch and it fixes the problem (it also gives LIFO
to accept with the downside that it needs to do an O(N) browse on the
waitqueue before doing the exclusive wakeup compared to 2.4.x that does
the wake-one task selection in O(1) if everybody is sleeping in accept, but it
does that FIFO unfortunately).
The real problem that DaveM knows well is that TCP in 2.2.x will end doing
three wakeups every time the socket moves from LISTEN to ESTABLISHED state, so
it was really doing a wake-three not a wake-one :). So the brainer part
is to fix TCP and not the scheduler/waitqueue part.
