Hello Tom
Your program is buggy and depends on scheduling policies.
To make it fails on 2.6.23 (or say 2.6.9) too, just add a sleep(1) before pthread_join() call
Once a thread calls pthread_detach(pthread_t this_id), it's not possible anymore to
pthread_join(this_id, &ret) or effect is undefined.
(quoting POSIX : "The results of multiple simultaneous calls to pthread_join() specifying the same target thread are undefined" )
