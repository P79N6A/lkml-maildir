I guess you're right, Lee.  I hadn't thought of it that way.  It just
looks broken to me because we have no standing in any normal kernel
requirements process.  That's a shame, but it does seem less like a
systemic issue.
I think the distributions are getting more interested in these issues.
Maybe that will help.  The RT-LSM is available as a module in Debian
sarge.
Back when I did OS development for a living, there was a huge focus on
defining user requirements.  But, our kernel development was never
organizationally separate from the rest of the OS.  That makes a big
difference.
