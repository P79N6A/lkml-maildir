Upward funargs are rather easy to trip over (though you haven't tripped
over them) and the runtime shits itself badly on all architectures when
they happen. It's too dangerous to be allowed to be used.
The code you posted doesn't really have a reason to use nested functions
(i.e. downward funargs aren't being used).
