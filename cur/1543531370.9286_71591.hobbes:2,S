Looks like early on, it tries to connect via a UNIX Socket and fails.
Strange, since your configuration file shows them enabled. The return
value was, I guess not checked (-1), later acroread tried to fcntl()
on that. After that, all bets are off.
I'd suggest:
`make oldconfig`
`make clean`
`make dep`
`make bzImage` # or whatever
I don't think your Unix sockets got built after the patch(es).
Cheers,
