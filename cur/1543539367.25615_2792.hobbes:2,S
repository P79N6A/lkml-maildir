This is why unresticted taskfile commands to ATA or SCSI must be filtered.
You make the point ever stronger.  With the patch for ATA and diagnostic
TASK commands not enabled. the kernel can prevent what you are saying can
be done.  Thus the stakes are now higher, and I did not want to bring SCSI
into this arena until a solution was in progress.  But now you have
done it.
SCSI has a one or two page taskfile limit, enough to do what you are
saying.
