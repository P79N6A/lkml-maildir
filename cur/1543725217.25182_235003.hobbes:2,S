The other day a machine of mine froze for reasons unknown after about
30 days of uptime.  No response to anything.
Upon reboot it got an unrecoverable file system error during
fsck.
So I dropped into a shell and issued the command fsck -y -C /dev/md1.
Around 73% it starting reporting
Unattached inode 250083
Connect to /lost+found? yes
Inode 250083 ref count is 2, should be 1. Fix? yes
This has been going on for 24 hours now, and fsck is
at
Unattached inode 1494419
Connect to /lost+found? yes
Inode 1494419 ref count is 2, should be 1. Fix? yes
Do you suppose this will ever end?  Has fsck gotten into
an infinite loop?  Shall I scrap the filesystem or let
it keep going?
How many days might it take?
I'm running linux 2.4.25 untainted with an ext2 filesystem
on an Athlon XP 2000+.
