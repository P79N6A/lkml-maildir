query_module(NULL, 0, NULL, 0, NULL) returns 0 if the kernel supports
query_module, -ENOSYS if it does not.
If the kernel supports query_module,
  query_module(NULL, -1, NULL, 0, NULL)
returns -ENOSYS if the kernel has been compiled without modules,
-EINVAL if the kernel was compiled with module support.
Grab the modutils source and see utils/modstat.c::new_get_kernel_info,
it uses all the query_module facilities.
