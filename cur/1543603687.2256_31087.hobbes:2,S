I should have said.
Both times this happened, the keyboard was working fine after being
plugged in, correctly recognising 30 or so keypresses before the crash.
It happened ~10 seconds after the keyboard was plugged in, with the
system and keyboard remaining functional, with no keyboard related messages
sysloged (remote syslog, so I'm sure), which is why I suspect it may
not be hardware.
