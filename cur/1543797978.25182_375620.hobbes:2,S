This means verifying all the users before patch submission, which may be 
problematic.
I guess the point I'm trying to make is that if you create a new API you 
have the option of converting the obvious cases first, which should 
cover the majority of users.  Anywhere the behaviour is non-obvious can 
be left using the old API, and the out-of-tree users will continue to 
work correctly.
