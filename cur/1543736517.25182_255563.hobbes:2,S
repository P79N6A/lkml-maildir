OK, I agree, so I tested that: wrote some value
to the higher word of ESP in the struct that
dosemu passes to vm86() syscall, let the prog
to run for a while, and the value was still there.
It is not 100% reliable test because I can't
guarantee the vm86() was interrupted during the
period I was waiting (because vm86() is executed
for the short durations, then exits on fault or
signal), but it looks OK and why not to beleive
Petr that v86 is not affected.

No. This URL is about dos4gw, so that's about a
prot. mode either.

AFAIK also WinNT is not affected. Not sure though.

Hey. It is not about 16bit DPMI mode, it is
about the 32bit DPMI mode. That's the whole
problem. Be it only about the 16bit DPMI mode,
the problem may not ever harm anything at all.
But for 32bit mode that's quite a problem.
