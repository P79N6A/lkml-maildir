ok, we can do that after a few days of testing.
Btw., note that when capturing traces via trace_pipe, i still see frequent 
mistakes of PIDs being matched up to the wrong 'comm' string
 loop-1sec-2895 ...
      Xorg-2895 ...
the Xorg-2895 is bogus. I have been seeing these for a long time and 
thought we fixed it, but i noticed them yesterday once more, while i was 
tracing some code. Any ideas about what's wrong there?
