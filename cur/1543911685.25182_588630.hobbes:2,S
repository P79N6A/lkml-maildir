To reproduce it, do this in -rc3:
cat > mini.conf << EOF
CONFIG_MODE_SKAS=y
CONFIG_BINFMT_ELF=y
CONFIG_HOSTFS=y
CONFIG_SYSCTL=y
CONFIG_STDERR_CONSOLE=y
CONFIG_UNIX98_PTYS=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_LOOP=y
CONFIG_LBD=y
CONFIG_EXT2_FS=y
CONFIG_PROC_FS=y
EOF
make ARCH=um allnoconfig KCONFIG_ALLCONFIG=mini.conf
make ARCH=um

(P.S. I note that in order for CONFIG_BLK_DEV_LOOP to actually trigger work 
now, I have to add CONFIG_BLK_DEV=y to the above, which I didn't have to do 
in 2.6.22 or in any previous version all the way back to 2.6.12.  Not a major 
regression, but still a bit of a surprise.  That said, the above is what 
triggered the break for me.)
