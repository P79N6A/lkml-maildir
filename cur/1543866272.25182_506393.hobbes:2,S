Well, i mean search for your `mkimage'.
Let's see how all this used in Makefiles (avr32, ppc, sh are same)
../arch/arm/boot/Makefile:
   MKIMAGE         := $(srctree)/scripts/mkuboot.sh
   ...
   quiet_cmd_uimage = UIMAGE  $@
         cmd_uimage = $(CONFIG_SHELL) $(MKIMAGE) -A arm -O linux -T kernel \
                   -C none -a $(ZRELADDR) -e $(ZRELADDR) \
                   -n 'Linux-$(KERNELRELEASE)' -d $< $@
type, which with bash or whatever, doesn't matter. All they need *your*
toolchain in $PATH, why not just to put "$CROSS_COMPILE-mkimage" instead
of $(CONFIG_SHELL) $(MKIMAGE) here? mkuboot.sh just searches $PATH for
mkimage and run it. Double overkill, no?

To run faster, but let me stop here.
