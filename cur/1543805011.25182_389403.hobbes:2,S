The short observation is currently we use at most 22bits of the pid
space, and we don't need a huge number of containers so combining them
into one integer makes sense for an efficient implementation, and it
is cheaper than comparing pointers.
Additional identifiers are really not necessary to user space and providing
them is one more thing that needs to be virtualized.  We can already
talk about them indirectly by referring to processes that use them.
And there will be at least one processes id assigned to the pid space
from the outside pid space unless we choose to break waitpid, and friends.
I just don't want a neat implementation trick to cause us maintenance grief.
