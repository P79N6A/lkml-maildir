On today snap of 2.5.70 from linux-2.5 bk tree while making make
oldconfig I always get:
Subarchitecture Type
> 1. PC-compatible (X86_PC)
  2. Voyager (NCR) (X86_VOYAGER)
  3. NUMAQ (IBM/Sequent) (X86_NUMAQ)
  4. SGI 320/540 (Visual Workstation) (X86_VISWS)
choice[1-4]:
Even if I'm doing this once after another, this a lil' bit complicates
creating binary packages with kernel, as building it should not wait for
any user input/interaction.
