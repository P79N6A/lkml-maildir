  I think the important thing is for the kernel to provide the functionality 
that 99% of the people will need, and then for userspace tools/daemons to 
hide the complex portions and make it easy for a user to get what he wants.
   /proc is not nearly a valid user interface, but it is one of the 
application interfaces.
