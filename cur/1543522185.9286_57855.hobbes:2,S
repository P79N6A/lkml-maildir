That sounded easy enough to accomplish that I went ahead and did it;
however, even after digging through the inline-asm info pages and such I
still can't discover what the "last step" to fix it is. I still get
compiler errors using the syscallX_pic versions.
// pic_sys.c
#include "unistd.h"
#include <errno.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/wait.h>
_syscall0_pic(pid_t, getpid)
_syscall1_pic(pid_t, getsid, pid_t, pid)
_syscall3_pic(pid_t, waitpid, pid_t, pid, int *, status, int, options)
#if 0
_syscall2_pic()
_syscall4_pic()
_syscall5_pic()
_syscall6_pic()
#endif
int main (int argc, char ** argv)
{
        int status;
        pid_t pid;
        pid = getpid();
        printf("0: %d\n", (int)pid);
        printf("1: %d\n", (int)getsid(pid));
        printf("3: %d\n", (int)waitpid(pid, &status, WNOHANG));
}
// end pic_sys.c
gcc pic_sys.c -fPIC -o pic_sys
syscall.c: In function `getsid':
syscall.c:7: fixed or forbidden register 3 (bx) was spilled for class BREG.
This may be due to a compiler bug or to impossible asm
statements or clauses.
I tried listing it in the clobbers, to no avail. I'm a bit more familiar
with just gas, without all this C crap on top of it :) :)
btw, does it matter that I've split the "pushl %ebx / int 0x80" over two
separate asm lines? I wouldn't think so because of the volatile, but I'm
not 100% sure. The reason I did it was so that the pushl/popl would be
consistent with one percent sign; if it were inside the asm with "int
$0x80" then it'd need two percents.
Thanks! (diff attached, your thoughts?)
