 Im all the time going through all the file in the
<KERNEL>/scripts/kconfig without any success. I dont
find any beginning and any end.
I want to expand the Kconfig by a new Attribute. The
property of the attribute is just to give out the
message that is written beside it, to a new component
of the struct menu or struct poperty.
e.g.
config BLA
bool "bla"
auto "blabla"
That what is written beside the "auto" should save in
the Component called char *auto in one of the above
mentioned struct. There must be some changes in the
file zconf.tab.c. Any Suggestion how to this??
