Hi!
I know, this maybe is F.A.Q, but I ask it anyway (because I have not found it
in kernel mail-list, so don't shot me!)  :
How about build-in XML-support to kernel?
Good or bad?
It would be wery useful for config-files? 
Yes, XML-format is big, an need disk space (that tag system needs
space), but it is easy to understand and it is standard way to format
data.
(...and I have a draft for small XML-parser in C-language;) )
