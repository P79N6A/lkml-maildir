the "real" solution is to have a small video driver in the kernel that
knows at least how to get back to text mode. It sounds obscene to some,
but if you get down to it it's not all that bad; the policy of what
modesettings to use can still be in userspace, the execution of the
series of IO's would be in the kernel, and the kernel would store
bundles of settings, including a "rescue" one, but also for
suspend/resume...
