In 2.4.0-test2 Andy Hendroid disabled interrupts during suspend.
This does *not* work on IBM ThinkPads, at least the 380XD.
It defeats CONFIG APM_ALLOW_INTS
I removed the cli/sti pair that Andy added and all works OK now.
This could probably the sti is harmless, but the cli should probably be
replaced with APM_DO_CLI
andy?
Cheers, Garst
