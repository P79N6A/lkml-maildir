One additional comment on the patch which I missed, and has shown to
be a related cause of problems on a different host controller...

This is a hack because you got your calculation above wrong.  If you
assume a fast clock, the timeout will be too slow for a slower clock.
If you do the calculation correctly and you won't need such hacks.
