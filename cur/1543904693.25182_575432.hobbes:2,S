Sounds like a good idea, although I suspect that CONFIG_PM really *is* 
fairly close to CONFIG_SUSPEND. The thing is, all the stuff it enabled is 
largely useless without at least STR.
(Yes, I realize that you can do per-driver suspend events etc, but I 
suspect not a lot of people have used it).
But from a logical standpoint, it does make sense to have a separate 
config option for the STR support.
