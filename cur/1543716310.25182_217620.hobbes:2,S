I'm claiming that you are wilfully misrepresenting the license of your 
code to another piece of code THAT YOU DON'T CONTROL.
I'm further claiming that this is unethical and quite possibly illegal.
How hard is that to understand? Remove that stupid lying line. Pronto.
How the _hell_ can you stand up for lying in public? Have you no shame?
