OK, let me state the basics.
To get real power savings, we:
- blank the display
- spin down the hard drive
- put the CPU into an ACPI sleep state
To do the latter well, we need to make sure there's no DMA. It is
important that less or little DMA will not help. We need no DMA.
So we need to handle the commonest scenarios fully.
I dare say that the commonest scenario involving USB is a laptop with
an input device attached. Input devices are for practical purposes always
opened. A simple resume upon open and suspend upon close is useless.
Now you could et X (and gpm, etc...) to close the device after some
timeout. However, if you do so, you arrive at the counterintuitive
situation that you have to enable remote wakeup for a closed device
and the added complication that you need to generate and propagate
wakeup events. Allowing X to explicitely suspend on opened device is
simpler and more flexible. Furthermore, such a model can be extended
to keyboards.

That's true, but insufficient.
