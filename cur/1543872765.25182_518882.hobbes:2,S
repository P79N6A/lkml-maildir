Thanks.

I had same idea as you have, so I tried to modify driver to use BAR0 as 
well, and (1) i2cdump then said that nobody is there and (2) dump of 
range fc00 was quite different from range 1c00 and f400.
So for my hardware I'm sure that BAR0 is of no use for me - if it is 3rd 
channel then either it uses different interface from nforce2, or nothing 
is connected to it.
