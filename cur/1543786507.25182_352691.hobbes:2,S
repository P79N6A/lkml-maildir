Hi Andrew,
nfsd is still broken in 2.6.14-rc2-mm1; the following procedure is
reproducable:
 rabbit:~# echo 2 >/proc/fs/nfsd/threads 
... /var/log/daemon.log says:
 Sep 22 13:52:55 rabbit kernel: NFSD: Using /var/lib/nfs/v4recovery as
 the NFSv4 state recovery directory
 Sep 22 13:52:55 rabbit kernel: NFSD: starting 90-second grace period
 Sep 22 13:52:55 rabbit portmap[3191]: connect from 127.0.0.1 to
 set(nfs): request from unprivileged port
Your -mm patches make the sunrpc client connect to the portmapper with
a non-privileged source port.  This is due to a change in
net/sunrpc/pmap_clnt.c, which manually resets the xprt->resvport
field.  My tiny patch removes this line.  I have no idea why the line
was added in the first place, does somebody know better?
