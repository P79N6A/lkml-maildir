There might be a misconception, I surely was not clear enough. Imagine a filesystem
where every filesystem object (file, directory) has it's fully resolved ACL stored
in (a) it's directory entry or (b) it's stat data. (This also needs to be
discussed.) This way, you can quickly know wether to allow or deny an access, you
do not need to check ACLs of all parents. I think this is the way you (Ted) imagine
ACLs.
The only real drawback of this implementation would be that ACL setting is slow.
(But checking is (much) more important than setting.) But there might be an easy
way to overcome the problem: when you run
chacl -R "user bob: deny" /test/abc
to deny every access from bob to every file below and including "/test/abc", chacl
does not recursively change all ACLs but tells the filesystem an order "for every
fs object including and below /test/abc, deny access from user bob". This order
might|should be stored on disk. After the filesystem receives the order, it starts
a background thread (or uses a userspace daemon) which executes this order. When
the daemon is ready, it tells the filesystem that the order has been completed. The
filesystem removes the order from its order list.
So far, nothing has changed regarding the speed characteristics of setting and
checking ACLs. But now, for every access, the filesystem can easily know wether the
list of pending orders is empty or not (most of the time, it will be empty). If
some access needs to be checked, and the list of orders is not empty, the access is
first checked against all the orders. If there is a match in the list of pending
orders, the order-list is authorative (because it is newer it shows how access
control should be). If there is no match, the on-disk fully resolved ACL must be
authorative. If the order list is empty, there won't be a match, and therefore
checking for matching can be left out entirely.
The orders should be saved (using the journal) (at least if the order cannot be
executed in one atomic journaled operation) because after a crash, you would want
to have the new state rather than the old one. (Using conventional static ACLs or
chmod|chown, you always would end up in the middle).
This way, you have following characteristics:
- you almost always have resolved ACLs for every fs object
- chacl takes effect immediately, no need to wait hours until ACLs are set like on
NT
- you might be faster than rwx (because with rwx, you need to check every path
component)
- changing ACLs of a bunch of files can be made an atomic operation
- but: setting still slows down system speed (but compared to the gain in checking
speed, it should be bearable)
This concept is quite appealing for me, what do you think?
Xuân. :o)
P.S.: I hope that I have been clearer now (I'm not a native english speaker), if
questions remain, please ask. :o)
P.P.S.: To the question: "What are you storing in the cache?": I store the list of
pending acl-change orders in the cache. (The word cache was quite misleading.
Sorry.)
