	I believe Alan made an announcement about this in the last day or
so describing what they were doing and what these drivers need to do to
upgrade.  He even provided the code examples along with the reasoning behind
the changes.  This is obviously one of the drivers that didn't get upgraded
yet.  I also just ran into this with FreeSwan 1.3 (IPSec for Linux) on
2.3.43 with the same problem, no tbusy.  They'll have to upgrade some
of their stuff now as well.
