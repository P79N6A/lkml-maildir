Because for MS_ASYNC, "msync() shall return immediately once all the write
operations are initiated or queued for servicing".
ie: the writes can complete one millisecond or one week later.  We chose 30
seconds.
And this is not completely fatuous - before 2.6.17, MAP_SHARED pages could
float about in memory in a dirty state for arbitrarily long periods -
potentially for the entire application lifetime.  It was quite reasonable
for our MS_ASYNC implementation to do what it did: tell the VM about the
dirtiness of these pages so they get written back soon.
Post-2.6.17 we preserved that behaviour.
