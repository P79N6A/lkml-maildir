As you begin moving toward increasingly general modes of operation, and
get to the point of having to filter actual system call parameters, I
think you would be better served by using an LSM and mediating access to
the actual kernel objects.
For your own particular mode of operation, have you considered running
the untrusted code in a virtual machine, using something like Xen,
rather than trying to create a "safe" subset of kernel calls for a
single kernel instance?
