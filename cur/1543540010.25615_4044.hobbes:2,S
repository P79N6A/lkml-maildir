GGI can work ontop of fbcon. Unaccelerated tho :-(

Correct. What you can do is mmap the MMIO region and program the hardware
yourself. Just be careful.

No their is no accel API for fbcon. Fbcon really is just for mode setting.
As for docs take a look at 
http://www.linux-fbdev.org
. Their are docs on
how to write a fbdev driver.

Some internal changes did happen for 2.3.X but far bigger changes are in
store for 2.5.X. 
Q: Why did they deprecate a.out support in linux?
A: Because a nasty coff is bad for your elf.
