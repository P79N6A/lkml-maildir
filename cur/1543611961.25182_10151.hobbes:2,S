It's not the CML1 language spec that interests me, just the user interface.  All
I care about is being able to do make menuconfig and make oldconfig, and get the
same results as before.  What goes on "under the surface" doesn't interest me at
all.
In fact, here's all I want to know about the whole CML2/kbuild 2.5 issue.  Right
now I upgrade my kernel like this (simplified slightly):
<apply latest patches>
mv .config ..
make mrproper
mv ../.config .
make oldconfig
make dep
make bzlilo modules modules_install
<reboot>
Will I still be able to do it this simply in 2.5.x?  (Assuming there's
eventually a 2.5.x I can get to compile cleanly.  :-)

I'm not a hacker, but I think it's a good thing to move to CML2.  I've
tested it and it's got some nice features.  The Python issue I don't
think is too onerous to require of people.  And wasn't there someone
out there porting CML2 to straight C code?
Why are people so wedded to the CML1 language spec anyway?
