Are we talking about VGA text mode or VT100 terminals? On what arch
Linux was written to run shell and to build itself?
IBM PC, if you don't know. Thus, your comment isn't funny or serious,
sorry. I also distinguish important, needed, useful, preferable.

As i did dumb userspace coloring of kernel messages after this post,
where text from bootloader, critical stuff are visible -- i.e. no
truncated scrollback is needed, i can say, that this comment is bogus.
I don't know what `ill-advised' commands are, but knowing how pipefs
wasn't up early in <2.6.2X, i can say: *IT IS EARLY*. By me anything,
that have /dev/console as controlling tty is early.

Cannot comment, because i don't understand this. I want scrollback in a
defined scrolling region; i what line scrolling not be cursed, if columns
number is odd.
Now i have all this in userspace *early*, so i don't care about what
ever implementors of that stuff in kernel thought.
Bye.
