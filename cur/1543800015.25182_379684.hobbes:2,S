I'll see if I can ferret some numbers out.  If not, I'll generate them,
but it will take me a day or so.  I'm pretty sure it makes a difference
of tens to hundreds of nanoseconds, which in our case is very
significant (we measure some of our user-level performance in increments
of 10ns, very repeatably).

Yeah, clearly if there's no difference, it's not worth the trouble.
