Several people have asked me how to set this up, so I'll give the info
here.
- change inittab to call shutdown with -h instead of -r
- telinit Q
I think there is a catch on x86 though - I think shutdown -h powers the
machine down rather than halting it.  The redhat initscripts seem to
need a /halt file to prevent poweroff.  Maybe calling /sbin/halt
instead of shutdown from the initscripts would work better in those
cases...
