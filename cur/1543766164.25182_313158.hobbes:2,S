okay - i found this:
	
http://seclists.org/lists/linux-kernel/2000/Mar/0093.html
it talks about "we must force people to choose between vgacon and
fbcon".
when that forcing decision was taken, was dual fbcon-and-serial-console
usage taken into account?
booting with ..... console=ttyCL1 fbcon=vc:1 and then later
on doing modprobe fbcon has exactly the same consequences:
fbcon_takeover is called, the fbcon=vc:1 parameters appear to
be ignored.... greeeeaat.
how the _heck_ am i gonna over-ride the fb_console "setup"
paramaters on a module load, to stop this happening???
i know - HACK TIME!!!
muhahahahah.
