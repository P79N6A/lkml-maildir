Yes you're right.  What I said was total rubbish.  I read your
statement as meaning to dynamically allocate/deallocate inodes from a
set configured at filesystem creation...

Well this is an issue that affects all filesystems on 32-bit systems
(as Alan said inode numbers are 64 bits on 64 bit systems).  To be
honest I've never let this worry me...
A 32-bit system can never cache 4G inodes in memory without falling
over, and so a simple solution would be to allocate the 32-bit inode
number dynamically (e.g. starting at one and going up, keeping track
of inode numbers still used for use when/if wraparound occured), this
would guarantee inode number uniqueness for the subset of file inodes
in memory at any one time, with the drawback that inode numbers
allocated to files will change over filesystem mounts.  Alternatively
from reading fs/inode.c it appears that inode numbers only need to be
unique if the fast hashed inode cache lookup functions are used, there
are other inode cache lookup functions that can be used if inode
numbers are not unique.

Ideally yes, but ultimately with your filesystem you make the rules
:-)   The Squashfs directory design was fast for the original expected
directory size (ideally <= 64K, maximum 512K) seen on embedded
systems.  The next release of Squashfs has considerably improved
indexed directories which are O(1) for large directories.  To be
released sometime soon, if anyone's interested...
