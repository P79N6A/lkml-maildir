Please make patches against 2.6.12-rcX, not against 2.6.11.z.
(probably doesn't matter in this case)

Kernel preferred style is not to split the function definition line.

Lose the ifdef/endif.  Don't make #includes conditional.

Did you mean to leave these printk()s here?
I think not, but if so, they need a KERN_ level, like KERN_INFO.
It would help readability if you would add some spaces around
'=', after commas, etc., in places like these:
+	for (d=devlist; d; d=d->next)
and
+	} while (!aoedev_bymajor_minor(CONFIG_ATA_OVER_ETH_ROOT_SHELF,CONFIG_ATA_OVER_ETH_ROOT_SLOT));
and
+	aoe_root(CONFIG_ATA_OVER_ETH_ROOT_SHELF,CONFIG_ATA_OVER_ETH_ROOT_SLOT);
Thanks.
