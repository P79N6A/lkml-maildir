Andrew,
Inspired by Matt Mackall's pagemap patches and ideas, these textual interfaces
are worked up to achieve the same goals. The patchset runs OK on various read
sizes.
1) Add PSS to the existing /proc/<pid>/smaps:
        [PATCH 1/4] maps: PSS(proportional set size) accounting in smaps
2) Create /proc/<pid>/pmaps for page granularity mmap footprints:
        [PATCH 2/4] maps: address based vma walking
        [PATCH 3/4] maps: introduce generic_maps_open()
        [PATCH 4/4] maps: /proc/<pid>/pmaps interface - memory maps in granularity of pages
