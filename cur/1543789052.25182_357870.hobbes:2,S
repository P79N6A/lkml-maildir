Recently, I was just wondering the same thing.  However, there 
are complexities to consider.  C libraries (okay, glibc is the 
main one I concern myself with) sometimes add some functionality 
in the wrapper function for a particular system call.  This also
needs to be documented in the Secion 2 page. 
Nevertheless, I think the idea of binding the kernel sources and 
Sections 2 and 4 of the manual pages a bit more tightly bears
some consideration.  In the ideal world, when a change is made to
the kernel, the patch could include adjustments to the man 
pages (if relevant) -- then the changes could follow the patch 
through the -mm tree and then into Linus's tree.

I'd guess that the uncompressed source of the relevant pages 
would be around 3 MB.

Thanks.  But the greatest part of credit must go to Andries, 
the maintainer for nearly 10 years.  I'm shortly coming up to my 
first anniversary...
Cheers,
