Hello guys,
Just to make my previous mail more concrete, the following program
illustrates a problem with current implementation of pread(2). Namely,
reading beyond the end of file should (by Single UNIX spec) set
errno=EOVERFLOW. Currently it returns 0, and sets errno =0 (Success),
whilst leaving the buffer intact.
Btw, if one tries to pread() on a socket it does return ESPIPE which is
what I expect.
However, if you set the offset to something negative, it does not set
errno=EINVAL (again required by Single UNIX) but sets it to 0 and returns
0.
So, there are some, at least minor bugs with the current implementation of
pread(2) (and I dare guess pwrite(2) also).
Regards,

PS. File "pread.dat" can look like anything that "tickles your fancy"
as long as it is not too (<40 bytes) big.
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <linux/unistd.h>
_syscall4(ssize_t, pread, unsigned int, fd, char *, buf, size_t, count, loff_t, pos)
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
	int fd, len;
	char buf[100];
	buf[0] = '\0';
	fd = open("pread.dat", O_RDWR);
	if (fd < 0) {
		perror("open()");
		exit(1);
	}
	len = pread(fd,  buf, 10, 40);
	buf[len]='\0';
	if (len != 10) {
		fprintf(stderr, "pread(), len=%d, %s, errno=%d\n", len, strerror(errno), errno);
	}
	fprintf(stderr, "buf=<%s>\n", buf);
	(void)close(fd);
	return 0;
}
