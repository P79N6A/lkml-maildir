CHATTR(1)                                               CHATTR(1)
BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
       As of ext2 fs 0.5a, the `c' and `u' attribute are not hon­
       oured by the kernel code.  As of the Linux 2.0 kernel, the
       'A'  attribute  is  not  yet supported by the kernel code.
       (The noatime code is still in testing.)
       These attributes will be implemented in a future  ext2  fs
       version.
E2fsprogs version 1.10      April 1997                          2
... so it looks like if it has been on the TODO list for quite some time ;)
