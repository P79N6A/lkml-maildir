Is this the first in a multi-step patch series, or something like that?
You just duplicated code in a generic location and pasted it into the
arch.  Where's the gain in that?  I do see the gain in letting the arch
allocate the task struct, but surely your patch should provide a generic
mechanism for an arch to call by default, instead of duplicating code??
