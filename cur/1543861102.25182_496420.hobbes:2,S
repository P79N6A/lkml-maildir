Ok...
I started fight with tifm driver. I made a 2.6.18 kernel from debian by
debian way with mmc debug enabled and downloaded tifm source v. 0.6.
I made this module separately just by make/make install.
I put 
tifm_7xx1
tifm_sd 
into /etc/modules.
and everything working perfect.
there is no ndiswrapper problem with irq.
thx for help
