It's not correct. Of course I assumed proper usage, i.e., that B already
disabled it. Please re-read the lock-up scenario.
It is a scholar example of resource competition which requires mutual
exclusion if the resources are to remain consistent. The problem is
"hidden" in the fact that once the processor B decreases the count
to zero and thus decides it is going to set the bit in the mask, it will
do it, and nothing is going to prevent it, even if A would use
disable_bh() gazillion times meanwhile...
