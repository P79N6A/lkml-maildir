I think revisions have an average time between them that follows a
general linear trend.  {1 4 3 1 0 2 2 3} is a general linear trend; a
line between these points best dividing half above and half below is
horizontal.  *The assertion that revision numbers are linearly
correlated to time is a conjecture; I have not verified this
mathematically.*

Perhaps, but that was a heavy development period and I want to avoid
lurking variables; otherwise I'd have included 2.4's whole series too.
I know this is a lost cause in 2.6, what with things like devfs or OSS
dropping and ALSR getting merged in at random times....

(ax^2 + bx + c)d/dx == 2ax + b
I didn't eye the curve as quadratic; I eyed it as a gentle curve.  I
took the differences and looked for a trend specifically because I know
a linear growth trend (polynomial degree 1) indicates a quadratic trend
(polynomial degree 2).
As I said, I don't have enough samples.  I only used 16 of the 19
samples I have to generate the function above; I would like upwards of
30 before claiming any useful trend.
