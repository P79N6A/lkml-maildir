This is all inside the normal interrupt handling logic, so it should be 
exactly as safe as any interrupt is: we don't allow the _same_ interrupt 
to be entered recursively at the same time.
So yes, the counts etc are done non-atomically, but the code around it all 
guarantees that only one concurrent invocation happens per irq descriptor, 
so it's all ok.
(The one exception to that may be the "desc->status" modification in case 
the irq is determined to have screamed, since "status" can be modified by 
a recursive interrupt coming in, but (a) that's a "this irq is dead" 
schenario _anyway_ and (b) if we ever care, we should lock it _there_, not 
somewhere else).
