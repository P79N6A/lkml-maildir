Yes, each time that /dev/hda11 is reiser4 and mounted, I get that error.
Other fs report OK, tested were ext2, ext3, reiserfs, jfs, xfs.  Size
is about 4G.  At some point in the past, around 2.5.60, I tested the
reiser4 snapshot, and this problem did not exist.  Unfortunately, I
don't remember what the base distro was for those tests.
Distro is Red Hat Severn (the latest RH beta).
df --version reports df (coreutils) 5.0
/lib/libc.so.6 reports 2.3.2
gcc is 3.3
kernel is 2.6.0-test4 of course.
reiser4progs is 0.4.12

I also tried a copy of df version 4.5.7 from a Mandrake 9.1 system, with
exactly the same results as above.
Let me know if you have further questions.
