Based on review comments received so far, we will be posting an updated 
kernel patch for OProfile for Cell.  Most notably, this patch removes 
some racey conditions between our "virtual counter" function and the 
interrupt handler, as well as fixing the way we were restarting and 
stopping our timer for the virtual counter.
Thanks.
