Dunno. Stock kernel (somewhat) manages NFSv2, Solaris et al speak
NFSv3. Linux -- Linux is reported to work, Linux -- Others doesn't.

Get the latest knfsd (+ kernel patches) from 
ftp://ftp.varesearch.com/pub/support/hjl/knfsd/
Patch carefully (some patches don't apply cleanly!)
Cross your fingers and reboot.
Works here (Sun SS4) with 2.2.11 vs Solaris 2.6, but _not_ exactly heavy
use; mostly as a client.
Good luck!
