Ok. Suspending never really worked on my laptop so I'll have to assume
you're correct. :)
[ Just tried once again to do a suspend to ram, seems that there were
some enhancements in this area lately. 
  No luck. Machine suspends ok, but upon waking up, the power led goes
  greek ok, the disk led lights up, but the keyboard is dead, the
  network card is dead, the screen doesn't turn on...
  Since this laptop has no serial port I don't see what else I can do,
  except wait another 6 months and try again... :(
