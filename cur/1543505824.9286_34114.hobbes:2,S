: My point of view is the following:
: Ideally a Linux man page should discuss the behaviour of
: any library routine on all Unix platforms, with special
: attention to the Linux details. It should tell how much
: of the behaviour is prescribed by POSIX, X/Open, Susv2 etc.
: It should give the Linux kernel version that first implemented
: a system call. Should mention the kernel versions where the
: behaviour changed significantly. Should describe libc5 and
: glibc differences.
Well said, couldn't agree more.
I don't know if this is of any use or not, but a few months ago I was
talking to someone at the OpenGroup about releasing their man pages
and their man2html conversion tools.  It never went anywhere but if
there was wide spread support for the idea, as in it would increase
the quality of the Linux man pages if we could get these to start with,
then I'll go back and try again.
