I hope you haven't broken running WITH ide-scsi, because most people still
run 2.4 kernels in real life and only test 2.5 because someone has to do
it. Reconfiguring the system to use ide-scsi or not is just one more PITA
thing which needs to be done, or more likely forgotten, with every new
kernel.
