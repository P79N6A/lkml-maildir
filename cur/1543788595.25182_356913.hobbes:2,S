Ingo, 
could this be the same bug that's been hitting me since 2.6.13* ?
usenetgateway (heavy used server) with scsi/gig-E ethernet which
crashes within couple of days.
Last kernel i tried was 2.6.14-rc3-git5  and that was the first kernel
which also reported:
------------
warning: many lost ticks.
Your time source seems to be instable or some driver is hogging interupts
rip release_console_sem+0x151/0x210
Falling back to HPET
printk: 4 messages suppressed.

The crash itself:

------------
On all previous kernel crashes either scsi or ethernet suddenly quit working.
Since scsi driver is exact same version as 2.6.12-mm1 which for me keeps working 
perfectly, it sounds logic that if the IRQ system gets fedup some driver is likely
to grind the kernel to a painfull halt.
Just my feedback
