I would eventually like to see something similar to this in ALSA. 
I wrote the touchscreen driver plugin and an ALSA AC97 plugin API will
probably be needed before this time next year to keep Linux up to date
in the PDA/Tablet/Portable space. Eventually we may need an I2S and/or
Azalia (next gen audio) API layer for such devices.
I intend to speak to the ALSA guys as soon as the OSS plugin driver has
stabilised.
