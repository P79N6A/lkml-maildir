Well it could only be done by hardware.  The P5B has those jumpers.  I
figured the P5B-VM while a budget micro board would still have those.  I
guess not.  Without jumper settings for it there is nothing you can do
about it.  A quick look through the manual certainly only mentions
standby power for the keyboard connector and not for the USB ports.
