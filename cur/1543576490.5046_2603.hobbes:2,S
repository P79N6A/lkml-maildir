If we use ll_rw_block directly on buffers of anonymous pages
(page->mapping == &anon_space_mapping) instead using
dirty_list_writepage() (which will end up calling block_write_anon_page)
we can fix the buffer flushtime issue.

At writepage() context we do not know if we should care about the
flushtime.

Could you please send me your latest patch ?
