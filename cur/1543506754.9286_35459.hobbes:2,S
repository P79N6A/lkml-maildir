I'm not sure you need this change.  Contrary to what some docs say, you
can include both ide cdrom support (including the CD changer support)
and scsi emulation.  You can then use lilo to tell the kernel which
drive gets which support.  I have in my append line in lilo.conf the
following:  hdc=cdrom hdd=ide-scsi.  It works for me!
