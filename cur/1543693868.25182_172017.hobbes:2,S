I found one problem: the same timer can run on multiple cpus at the same time.
timer on cpu 0. running on cpu 0.
add_timer on cpu 1. expires immediately. running on cpu 1.
Your mail arrived out of order - thus I don't know yet if the 9th field 
is a counter or a flag - a counter might work, but is quite ugly.
