Yes, at that time I preferred to fall back to the caller open(2) if any 
error happened during the COW (a more picky implementation would simply 
bounce an error to the application). Look BTW that there is a difference 
between the error handling when you have an in-kernel solution or a 
completely userspace solution. If you push this inside the kernel you have 
at least to define a new open(2) flag and a new set of errors that might 
arise when doing the COW. You are basically changing the open(2) API. You 
have also to "teach" apps to use the new flag, since obviously you cannot 
make COW a default behavior. The fl-cow approach let you define a set of 
paths where you want COW to happen (in my case typically /usr/src/lk), and 
only apps writing to hard-linked files inside such path gets COWed. The 
open(2) API does not change. OTOH there is the LD_PRELOAD trick that is 
weak alias dependent.
