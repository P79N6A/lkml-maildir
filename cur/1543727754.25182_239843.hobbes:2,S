It looks like this one is actually real, because when I use the
preempt-timing patch it corresponds to a report of a 10ms
non-preemptible section.  get_user_pages appears to be the offender.
jackd does not print an xrun report here due to this code in
alsa-driver.c:
/* Delay (in process calls) before jackd will report an xrun */
#define XRUN_REPORT_DELAY 64
...
if (snd_pcm_status_get_state(status) == SND_PCM_STATE_XRUN
  && driver->process_count > XRUN_REPORT_DELAY) {
  ... print xrun errmsg ...
}
Presumably the author thought this behavior was by design.
