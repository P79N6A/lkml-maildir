As discussed there are arguments for zImage and bzImage as default. I
tend to leave zImage the default because:
- You can see something is wrong at compiling time not at boot time.
- It is very easy to determine what is wrong.
- You are told what is wrong.
So I consider this as the safe choice.
At the moment if 'make zImage' fails you get a line like this:
If you get the message 'kernel to big' use 'bzImage' (option -b)
That should stop newcomers from bothering kernel people with this
question, I hope.
Maybe I get it working to autodetect this problem and do this
automatically.

I want to leave this in as long as I have a statement that there is NO
case where it is needed. Generally a 'make clean' should not be
necessary except for the case that something went wrong, I think. But I
want to be on the safe side and at least it doesn't hurt except for the
longer compiling time. But maybe I should make this an option for people
who need a quick compiling.

Yes, that's a good idea. I'll do that.
Thanks for your feedback.
