These look good - and they should work fine on the 5535 - none of the patches
really change how we touch the hardware, just when we touch the hardware.
5536 is by far the more popular chip now, so I recommend we put these in,
and if by some unlucky coincidence a 5535 bug pops up, we'll deal with it
when it happens.
