And Andrey Savochkin is no idiot.  But if he had a standard
problem-reporting macro to guide him, he wouldn't have done this.

Ditto.

(Um, this is supposed to go into the 2.5 kernel, so the last arg is
void).
This doesn't deprecate printk().  It just formalizes printk() for
problem reporting inside drivers.  As we see more tools come out
making this useful, I expect drivers will willingly change across.
You can ensure that each message says what the driver name and kernel
version is if you want, *without* changing every driver.
You can do this with some "printk templates", but *that* would be too
ugly to live:
	#include <linux/net_templates.h>
	...
	printk(NETPROBLEM_27, dev, skb);
	...

That's not a good reason.  compat.h can define them into printks with
a bit of cpp magic.  In fact, Werner already wrote that.  Hmm... the
one in the patch they posted is not based on Werner's, but my older
work.  It should look vaguely like:
/* Do not meddle in the affairs of cpp, for it is subtle, and quick to anger */
#define __detS_
#define __detV_
#define __detS_detail(label,format,value) " " #label "=" format
#define __detV_detail(label,format,value) value,
#define __detV_3(detail) detail
#define __detV_2(detail,...) detail __detV_3( __detV_ ## __VA_ARGS__)
#define __detV_1(detail,...) detail __detV_2( __detV_ ## __VA_ARGS__)
#define __detS_3(detail) detail
#define __detS_2(detail,...) detail __detS_3( __detS_ ## __VA_ARGS__)
#define __detS_1(detail,...) detail __detS_2( __detS_ ## __VA_ARGS__)
#define recovered(id, msg, ...)						     \
	printk(KERN_WARNING "%p:%s:" __detS_1( __detS_ ## __VA_ARGS__) "%c", \
	       id, msg, __detV_1( __detV_ ## __VA_ARGS__) '\n')
#define problem(id, msg, ...)						 \
	printk(KERN_ERR "%p:%s:" __detS_1( __detS_ ## __VA_ARGS__) "%c", \
	       id, msg, __detV_1( __detV_ ## __VA_ARGS__) '\n')
#define introduce(id, name, ...)				\
	printk(KERN_INFO "Introducing %p:%s:"			\
	       __detS_1( __detS_ ## __VA_ARGS__) "%c", 		\
	       id, msg, __detV_1( __detV_ ## __VA_ARGS__) '\n')
#define unintroduce(id)					\
	printk(KERN_INFO "Unintroducing %p\n", id)
================
Now, these were the previous macros which didn't have a severity arg,
but you get the idea.
