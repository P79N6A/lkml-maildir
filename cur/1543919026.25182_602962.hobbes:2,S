Good catch indeed.  Though I was puzzled how we do nonlinear at all,
until I realized it's "The test for not VM_CAN_NONLINEAR always fails".
It's not as serious as it appears, since code further down has been
added more recently to simulate nonlinear on non-RAM-backed filesystems,
instead of going the real nonlinear way; so most filesystems are now not
required to do what VM_CAN_NONLINEAR was put in to ensure they could do.
I'm confused as to where that leaves us: is this actually a fix that
needs to go into 2.6.23?  or will it suddenly disable a system call
which has been silently working fine on various filesystems which did
not add VM_CAN_NONLINEAR?  could we just rip out VM_CAN_NONLINEAR?
I hope Nick or Miklos is clearer on what the risks are.
(Apologies for all the "not"s and "non"s here, I'm embarrassed
after just criticizing Ingo's SCHED_NO_NO_OMIT_FRAME_POINTER!)
