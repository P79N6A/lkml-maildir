Less change to the source, but the result is less obvious about what it's 
doing.  I'd personally rather have the churn than wind up with magic 
syntax...

It's ok to _explicitly_ not have a loglevel, and thus take a known default.  
The problem is printing out less than a full line, continuing it later, and 
not making obvious at compile time what the level of this chunk is.

Worse, if you feed an absolute path to O= when you build the kernel out of 
tree, then it uses absolute paths for all the __FILE__ strings and that makes 
kernel BIIIIIG.  (Did that by accident a while back.)  Too bad there's no way 
to keep the __FILE__ strings compressed at runtime and gunzip them as needed 
like busybox does with help messages... :)
