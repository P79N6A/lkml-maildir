Alan, I bow to your superior knowledge and judgement. However,
'ide_scan_direction' is only used in two places in ide.c, and both of
those are only compiled in if CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEPCI:  
in ide_setup(): 
#ifdef CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEPCI
        if (!strcmp(s, "ide=reverse")) {
                ide_scan_direction = 1;
                printk(" : Enabled support for IDE inverse scan order.\n");
                return 1;
        }
#endif /* CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEPCI */
in probe_for_hwifs(): 
#ifdef CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEPCI
        if (pci_present())
        {
                ide_scan_pcibus(ide_scan_direction);
        }
#endif /* CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEPCI */
So protecting the variable with #ifdef .. #endif seems the simplest
and least intrusive way to fix it. How would you prefer I do it?
