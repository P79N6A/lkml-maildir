Yup I agree! Greg's patch is better since i clears the
bit *just* before we take the cpu down. That way we won't mess with the 
ordering. 
But I would still prefer that we update the sched_domains early on 
after cpu-hotplug rather than doing it after the subsystems have run 
their notifiers.
Will send a seperate patch for that one.
