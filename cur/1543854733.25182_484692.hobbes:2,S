Ok, I see your point. There may not be an actual bug here, but
couldn't it still be considered an improvement, given that with my
patch we'll  a) print a warning that we ran into a memory shortage
problem, and  b) we save a call to ipc->decompress() and some switch
logic in the failing case.   ???
I still think the patch makes sense. Perhaps not for the reasons
initially stated, but it adds an error message for a condition that
people may want to see and it errors out a bit earlier in the error
case.
