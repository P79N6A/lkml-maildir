What's wrong with the generic HDLC update then? Are you going to apply it?
ftp://ftp.pm.waw.pl/pub/linux/hdlc/hdlc-2.4.21pre7-1.14.patch
or 
http://ftp.pm.waw.pl/pub/linux/hdlc/hdlc-2.4.21pre7-1.14.patch
Yes, it applies to 2.4.21-pre7 and later kernels, including 2.4.22-pre2.
I hope it will require "-R" to apply it to pre3...
TIA.
