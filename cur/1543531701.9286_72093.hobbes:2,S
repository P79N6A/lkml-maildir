Not true: RAM chips are produced with say 33 banks where in theory 32
would suffice. Every bank can be disabled and replaced by the "spare"
one. There is a bunch of fuses that disables one of the 33 banks, and
can program the spare to fill in for the disabled bank. 
The ones where the 32 primary banks are enabled and the spare is
disabled is slightly faster than the ones where the spare has to be
used.
So single-error RAM chips are used for production.
