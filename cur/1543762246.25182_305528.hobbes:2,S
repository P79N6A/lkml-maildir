Yes, it's going to go away soon, but it /is/ still in the kernel.
As I see it, as long as something is in the kernel there's no reason to 
not keep improving it if someone is willing to do the work. And since the 
patch is already done why not use it?
For every kernel that has devfs build in this patch will save a few bytes 
of kernel memory, and why not give people that tiny bennefit?
