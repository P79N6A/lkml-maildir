Hi,
Is there a global means to disable the CONFIG_USB_SUSPEND feature, perhaps
through /proc or /sysfs?
I know this can be done, in a semi-reliable manner, on a per-device
basis by writing 0 or 2 to the /sys/.../device/power/state file, but
I'm looking for something that will have the same effect as disabling
CONFIG_USB_SUSPEND, but without recompiling the kernel.
Thanks,
- Chris
