Subject: [2.6 patch] net: drop duplicate assignment in request_sock
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

From: Norbert Kiesel <nkiesel@tbdnetworks.com>
Just noticed that request_sock.[ch] contain a useless assignment of
rskq_accept_head to itself.  I assume this is a typo and the 2nd one
was supposed to be _tail.  However, setting _tail to NULL is not
needed, so the patch below just drops the 2nd assignment.
