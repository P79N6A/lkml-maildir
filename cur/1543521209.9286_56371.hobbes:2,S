I've always wondered, why start 2.5 later? Just spawn the 2.5 branch
when 2.4.0-pre appears. So development needs not to stop.
I think that there's so much pressure on putting features inside 2.3 now
(wasn't it feature-freezed?) because 2.6 is SO far away that many can't
just wait for it.
Moreover, when 2.4 is out, there will be no development branch. So people
will start developing against it (but wait, shouldn't be a *stable* release?).
It already happened (RAID, ReiserFS?) and will probably happen with ext3.
Having a 2.5 branch soon also means a 2.6 is coming sooner, and maybe
we can have ext3 in it.

That's it. "post 2.4" means adding it to a "stable" beast. Just put it
in 2.5 (very soon) and release it in 2.6 (or backport it to 2.4 in case
of huge demand). Right now we have NEW features which need to be ported
from the (stable) 2.2 branch to the (feature-freezed) 2.3 branch. Weird
at least, don't you think so?.
