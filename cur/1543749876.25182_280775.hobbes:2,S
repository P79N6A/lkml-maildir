hi,
today i upgraded my kernel from 2.6.9-rc2 to 2.6.10-rc3-bk12, now i get the
following assertion failures while using the (closed source) phion vpn client,
the vpn client uses ethertap, there are no closed source kernel modules or the 
like:
KERNEL: assertion (!atomic_read(&sk->sk_wmem_alloc)) failed at 
net/ipv4/af_inet.c (150)
when the kernel prints out the above message the connection for the program 
using the vpn gets stuck - it happens very often if i use rdesktop, but it 
also happens when i just use ssh, so the bug may be triggered more often when 
there is more traffic over the vpn tunnel.
i tried with some other 2.6 kernel releases:
up to and including 2.6.9-rc2: no problem
2.6.9-rc3      does not boot on my machine
2.6.9-rc4      assertion failed as explained above
2.6.9        assertion failed as explained above
so it seems ethertap got broken somewhere post 2.6.9-rc2.
any ideas what got changed post 2.6.9-rc2 wich might cause this?
thanks for looking at this problem, if i can provide more information, just 
contact me.
bye,
 simon.
