I thought kernel data weren't swapped at all?
Mostly because kernel data could be needed immediately, with
no option of waiting for swapin. 
So, bad swap should only really kill userspace programs,
although it probably can cause some bad delays in cases
where the userspace program calls into the kernel,
passing an address that happens to be in damaged swap.
You might then stall the kernel holding some resources
while the disks retries umpteen times.

Some swap is nice to have.  "Ouch - sluggish server today,
I will have to look into it" is so much better
than "Eww - the OOM serial killer took out another 5 processes,
people are screaming!"
As for reliable swap - swap on raid-1 is nice - and it
probably perform better than single-disk swap too,
although not as fast as striped swap.
