Is it possible to flush all entries in the buffer cache corresponding
to a single block device (i.e. simply drop them if they aren't dirty,
or write them to disk and drop them after this if they are dirty)?
I've got another device in my SCSI chain which writes to the disk, and
if the caches are not flushed, the computer won't see the updates.
(Synchronization is done manually, so it's not an issue---trust me, I
know what I'm doing. ;-)
Kernel version doesn't matter. ;-)
