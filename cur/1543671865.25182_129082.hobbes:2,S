That's a bunch.  Who's fletch?  
And more importantly, how do you keep track of what is in each of those?
I can see having 20, 100, whatever, and keeping it straight in your head
but 1600?

Kiss, kiss :)
Ted T'so made us support hard links for the revision control files for the
same reasons and it works pretty well.  We haven't extended that to the
checked out files because I'm nervous about tools which don't break the
links.
On the other hand, we could hard link the checked out files if they
were checked out read-only which mimics what you are doing with the
chmod...  That's a thought.
We'll still never be as fast as a pure hardlinked tree, that's balls to
the wall as fast as you can go as far as I can tell.
