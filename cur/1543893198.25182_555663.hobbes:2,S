I'm almost certain that it is the same in the US, not the death+90 previously 
stated. (I've read the copyright laws a number of times to deal with some 
involved conversations) In some of the writings tied the change that made it 
death+70 its stated that said change was made to "bring US laws in line with 
Europe and most of the rest of the world" (paraphrase - I didn't bother going 
and digging out the page again). It's a relatively common belief - and, IIRC, 
was even brought before the US Supreme Court - that the copyrights length was 
changed to give Disney longer protection, if just because a lot of Disney's 
copyrights were going to expire and the change was applied retroactively. 
(And, unsurprisingly, the suit was shot down - 70 years is still a "limited" 
period. However, IIRC, there was some noted concern by the Supreme Court that 
the US Congress would exploit the legal loophole and just keep extending the 
copyright period retroactively to make it, effectively, never-ending. That 
scenario, while not *technically* in violation of the language of the US 
Constitution (which grants the US Congress the power to set the length of 
copyrights) would violate the spirit of it)
