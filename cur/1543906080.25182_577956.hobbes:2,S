that's without CONFIG_SMP, right? :-) On SMP they are about net break 
even:
     text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
    26535    4173      24   30732    780c kernel/sched.o-2.6.22
    28378    2574      16   30968    78f8 kernel/sched.o-2.6.23-git
(plus a further ~1.5K per CPU data reduction which is not visible here) 
btw., here's the general change in size of a generic vmlinux from .22 to 
.23-git, using the same .config:
     text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
  5256628  520760 1331200 7108588  6c77ec vmlinux.22
  5306918  535844 1327104 7169866  6d674a vmlinux.23-git
+50K. (this was on UP)
In any case, there's still some debugging code in the scheduler (beyond 
SCHED_DEBUG), i'll work some more on reducing it.
