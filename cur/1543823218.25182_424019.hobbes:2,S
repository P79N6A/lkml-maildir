Thank you for your reply.  
It apears that having multiple bus speeds is not the cause of my issue.
I was able to get the sata_mv module initalization to hang even when I
had only 2 cards plugged into both of the 100 MHz slots.  This issue is
extremely difficult to diagnose.  Sometimes the sata_mv module will load
just fine and recognize 24 drives, others it will hang the system during
intalization, and others it will only fine 23 drives, but the
initalization completes.  
Any help would be appreciated,
-Mike

I've reported more or less the same to the current maintainer. The third
card fails to work properly. In my case it seems to be because the first
two PCI-X slots are 133MHz and the third is 100MHz (Tyan K8SE).
Does that fit your case?
	With kind regards, Sander
