All,
I tried to update a RH7.1 box to 2.4.13pre2 but it keeps dieing on boot with
a raft of unresolved symbol errors in relation to the raid5.o module.  Is
there a fix for this? I didnt see anything in the
archives/newsgroups/www/all_other_places_I_looked.
btw.  I also tried 2.4.12ac3 and received the same errors.
thnx
Sam
