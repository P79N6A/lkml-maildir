glibc programs that use any sort of SysV ipc compiled before your patch
also use shorts for pid's, right?  
If so, then libc5 programs aren't the only problems.
All the more reason to get this straightened out in glibc now,
so more programs will work when the kernel throws the switch to allow
pid's above 32767.
