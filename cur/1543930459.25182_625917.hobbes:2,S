Past a certain point /dev/urandom will stat returning results which
are cryptographically random.  At that point, you are depending on the
strength of the SHA hash algorithm, and actually being able to not
just to find hash collisions, but being able to trivially find all or
most possible pre-images for a particular SHA hash algorithm.  If that
were to happen, it's highly likely that all digital signatures and
openssh would be totally broken.
