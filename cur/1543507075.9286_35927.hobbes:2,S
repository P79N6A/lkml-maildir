Subject: vm kills processes in our 2.3.12 port of reiserfs - what was the story  on the changes to mark_buffer_dirty() and the too many dirty buffers  issue?

We have a port of reiserfs to 2.3.12 in which dbench suffers from processes
getting killed
due to not being able to get memory.  There were some changes to
mark_buffer_dirty() in the 2.2
series that got dropped from the 2.3 series.  The 2.2 version as I remember was
intended to prevent
this very problem.   What is the story on this?  This problem doesn't happen
with ext2 with the same
number of clients, but I don't know how much that means.  Does ext2 do something
now to avoid
the issue?
Finally, let me ask the dumb question: why does vm do this, why doesn't it stall
rather than kill the process?
