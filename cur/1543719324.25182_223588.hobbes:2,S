irqbalance uses class based balancing to try to balance the "some are
heavier than others" thing.

yeah, and if you have more than 1 cpu, irqbalanced *will* spread them.

the userspace one is quite different and uses different level of information
(for example it makes class groups of irq's, eg it groups all ethernet
irq's, all storage irq's etc in separate classes and uses the class info in
the balancing algorithm). That surely is beyond what you'd want to do inside
the kernel, but it works great ;)
