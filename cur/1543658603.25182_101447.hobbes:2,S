AFAIK, because that would mean that you are allowing another machine to
manipulate your routing tables by simply using ICMP. How do you know
that you can trust the other machine, in this case, the nortel router ?
The problem is not of (missing) functionality, its about trusting the
integrity of the source of the ICMP redirect.
