Subject: 2.6.19-rc2-mm2 : empty files on vfat file system

Hello,
I have noticed something strange (and bad :) since using 2.6.19-rc2-mm2
(the problem is NOT present on 2.6.19-rc2-mm1 ; do not know for
mainline, I have not been able to test yet, but I think there have not
been recent changes in this area) : writing a file to a vfat
fs (fat 32) writes it, but with size 0 and no content. All this is
silent : no error message, nothing in the logs. After several attempts,
I checked the fs with fsck.vfat and it reported errors about some of the
files and told it was truncating them to size 0 (but their displayed
size was already 0, btw).
I hope this will ring a bell for some of you ? Maybe related to the
patch about strange bug messages about inodes in mm1 ?
