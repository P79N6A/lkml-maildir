But we don't know what is happening with David's system.
To rule out some possible causes David, you should run these tests:
memtest86 (www.memtest86.org
badblocks -s /dev/hda (read only hard drive test, newer versions have a -p
option for safe write mode tests too)

But maybe for david...  David, try the tests above with read only badblocks...

It would probably recognize a 2gb drive, which you could easily raid 1 for
your server, assuming that there are two ide connectors on that old 386 MB.
This just adds another possible test...  Buying a new power supply.
David, let us know what you find...
