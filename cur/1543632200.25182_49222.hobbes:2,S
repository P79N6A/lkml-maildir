I am keeping this in mind.  Unfortunately we are running into command
line options explossion.  We already do have -msse, -msse2,
-mfpamath=sse/i387/sse,i387
all affecting in nontrivial way the compilation.  I would like to
implement SSE based string functions and SSE based integer arithmetics
soon, later we may want to use SSE for complex numbers and
autovectorization.  We may want to use MMX when the register files are
split and 3dNOW as alternative for float arithmetics.
By adding option for each such feature, soon we will run out of
oppurtunities to test them all to be functional :(
