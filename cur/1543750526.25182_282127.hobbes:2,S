so that update tools that update kernels from vendors know which
bootloader file they need to update; eg right now those tools do all
kinds of hairy heuristics to find out if it's grub or lilo or .. that
installed the kernel. Those heuristics are fragile in the presence of
more than one bootloader (which isn't that uncommon in OS upgrade
situations).
