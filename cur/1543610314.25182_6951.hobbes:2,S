Most of the people which post without reading previous entries in the newsgroup
will also not read FRB (Frequently Reported Bugs) files. I actually got a great
suggestion in from Martin Bene. He suggests putting a last line in the build
process which always shows up if a failure occurs during kernel compiles.
Something along the lines of 'Your kernel failed to build. Check
www.where-ever-the-buglist-is.org for known issues with your kernel. Post your
problem on the kernel list if this is not a FRB'. Is this something that can be
done easily?
As a suggestion for such a web site, it would probably help if people who see
'their' bug present could file a description under the frb on such a web site,
to help developers figure out how many people are impacted and maybe to
correlate the circumstances.
