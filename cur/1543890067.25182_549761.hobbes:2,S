Hmm, this may or may not be a good idea for CodingStyle, I'll leave

But, if you are going to renumber chapters then please also fix up the
references to those chapter numbers elsewhere in the file - like this

"... (for example as a means of replacing macros, see Chapter 12) ..."
After your patch that now points to the wrong chapter.
