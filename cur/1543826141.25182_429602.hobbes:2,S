You haven't answered my question either.  What is the benefit of special
casing the initial stage of cpu resource competition?  Is it quantitatively
measurable?  If so, how much and with what workload?
Also there are oddness in the way that the sleep decision is made: 75% of
resched decision is to sleep, while 25% of the time is to run, but there
are fussiness in there and all depends on when the resched and time slice
expires.  Considering a scenario when resched occurs on jiffies%100 = 10,
and low priority task time slice of 100 jiffies, the current code always
decide to run the low priority task!
 if (rt_task(smt_curr)) {
    /*
     * With real time tasks we run non-rt tasks only
     * per_cpu_gain% of the time.
     */
    if ((jiffies % DEF_TIMESLICE) >
       (sd->per_cpu_gain * DEF_TIMESLICE / 100))
             ret = 1;
The whole point is: precise fairness can not be (or difficult to) control
at milli-second range.  It all will work out statistically in a long run.
Which again brings back the question: what does the special casing in
precision control will bring to the overall scheme?  So far, I have not
seen any quantitative measure at all that indicates it is a win.
