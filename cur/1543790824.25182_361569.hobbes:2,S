Unfortunately, the machine does quite a bit of other work apart from BIND, so
unless somebody can reproduce this on another machine, it will be a bit
difficult.
I have a run going in valgrind now to see if it can find anything bad about
the pointers in the msg_hdr structure (the structure itself appears to be OK,
judging from my printf-debugging); it's been going for a few hours, so I hope
it will be entering its zombie mode now soon :-)
