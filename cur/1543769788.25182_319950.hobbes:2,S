cdrdao

Does DAO. Can burn subchannel data. Can burn an audio CD.
dvd+-rw-tools
http://fy.chalmers.se/~appro/linux/DVD
+RW/
Burns DVD+/-R, though it does use mkisofs (iirc) which is part of cdrtools. 
Seems to burn DVD+R which I have mixed success with the Mandrake fork of 
cdrtools (no fault of Joerg, necessarily).
Therefore I'd recommend you install an unpatched, Joerg original version of 
cdrtools, burn DAOs and audio CDs with cdrdao, and use dvd+-rw-tools 
exclusively for burning DVDs. This combination has served me well, and since 
mastering it I've had no coaster discs.
Up to date GUI tools like k3b (
http://k3b.sourceforge.net/
) will make all 
these recommendations and set everything up for you. I don't use it myself, 
but I when I've seen it working, it looked good.
