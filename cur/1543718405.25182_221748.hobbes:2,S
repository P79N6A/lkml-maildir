Dave, would you be opposed to making IPv6 the default, with IPv4-only a
selectable option under CONFIG_EMBEDDED or whatever umbrella "I know
what I'm doing, let me remove vital parts of the kernel" config option
is considered appropriate?
It seems that the cost of IPv6 is small enough in most scenarios that
virtually everyone should be enabling it, and those who turn it off
should be willing to turn on CONFIG_EMBEDDED or whatever the umbrella
option is called.  I note with dismay that of the 18 arch/*/defconfig
files I perused, 13 do not set CONFIG_IPV6, 3 have =m, and 2 have =y.
