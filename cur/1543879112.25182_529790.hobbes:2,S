I'm still unhappy about these large search tables in the kernel, not 
because they take a huge amount of space (it's not that much), but 
because they're invariably going to be stale, as they're Unicode-version 
dependent.
At least please put them in a separate .c file and include a script to 
generate them clean from UnicodeData.txt.
Besides, would it not make more sense to have a single table with the 
width information, if you insist on having one, instead of multiple ones?
