Err, latency

by this, I mean that its not a big problem that we don't know how many
requests a process wants to submit.

BTW. sorry for the lack of better benchmark numbers. I couldn't
find good ones lying around. I found uniprocessor tiobench to
be quite helpful at queue_nr_requests * 0.5, 2 threads to
measure different types of overloadedness.
Also, I didn't see much gain in read performance in my testing -
probably due to AS. I expect 2.4 and 2.5 non AS read performance
to show bigger improvements from batching (ie. regressions).
