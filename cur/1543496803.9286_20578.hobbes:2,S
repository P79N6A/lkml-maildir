  Hi, all. Version 104 of my devfs patch is now available from:
http://www.atnf.csiro.au/~rgooch/linux/kernel-patches.html
The devfs FAQ is also available here.
NOTE: the main item of interest is that whole disc *and* partition
entries for SCSI removable devices should now disappear correctly.
This is against 2.3.3. Highlights of this release:
- Added documentation for some functions
- Added "doc" target to fs/devfs/Makefile
- Added "v4l" directory for video4linux devices
- Replaced call to <devfs_unregister> in <sd_detach> with call to
  <devfs_register_partitions>
- Moved registration for sr and sg drivers from detect() to attach()
  methods
- Register entries in <st_attach> and unregister in <st_detach>
- Work around IDE driver treating CD-ROM as gendisk
- Use <sed> instead of <tr> in rc.devfs
- Updated ToDo list
- Removed "oops-on-panic" boot option: now always Oops
				Regards,
					Richard....
