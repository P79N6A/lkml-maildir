i disagree: distro vendors wants that compatibility.
we want both the features of devfsd+hotplug+dynamic and the
compatibility devices.

there's been quite some cleanups on the 2.5.x side.
maybe can we complete this work before thinking about a new system ?
(remember the kbuild2 destiny ...)
if we do not want to create a compatibility layer such as devfsd for
smalldevfs, we can still alter drivers to create /dev/hda3 instead of
/dev/ide/host0/bus0/target0/lun0/part3 and the like
withouth any compatibility, smalldevfs will be a pain in th *ss for
distro vendors.
