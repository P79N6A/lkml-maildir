We have a number of functions which return small structures (such as
pte_t).  It seems that the kernel is not compiled with
-freg-struct-return, so all these small structures are being returned
via the stack, even though they would fit into registers.
Is there a reason for this?  Would -freg-struct-return be preferred?  It
would make a good compliment to -mregparm.
