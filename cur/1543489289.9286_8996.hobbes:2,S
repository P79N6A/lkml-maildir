Hi folks,
I've been trying to setup Linux 2.2.x (actually, 2.2.3 and 2.2.2-ac7) on a
4-way PPro SMP machine (Goliath II board, Aspen Columbine II machine I think
it's called).
The machine has an on-board NCR controller, which is disabled for some reason,
plus an NCR53c875 board whci actually controls the disks.
It's running pretty fine using Linux-2.1.100pre1 (don't ask... ;-)
I want to put 2.2.x, but so far no success.
I get an Ooops 0000, unable to handle kernel paging request.  Probably happens
when the NCR driver is loaded, though I'm not completely sure.  It happens
right after the floppy is detected.
In some other tests, the kernel acted as if no NCR driver was included and
panic'ed when it couldn't mount the root device.
Any words of wisdom anyone.
TIA,
					Christian
