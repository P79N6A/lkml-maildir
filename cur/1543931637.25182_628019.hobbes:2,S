I doesn't seem logical to do so: The patch needs to introduce the definitions
for 32-bits (in order to define pte_pgprot()), and not doing the adjustment
for 64-bits here means (a) becoming inconsistent and (b) the pte_pgprot()
there would be incorrect. So such a split out patch would need to be a pre-
requisite to the one here, which wouldn't help avoiding the collisions with
your unification patches.
