I said no but I did not look close enough. Sorry. 
I tried 2.6.14-rt4 on my laptop and there's no backtrace or anything
like that before the panic, but there was a message from selinux (I
don't have a copy and I'm not on that kernel - something like "no policy
loaded but in enforcing mode"). So I turned selinux off and it booted...
I'm also seeing selinux oddities in my amd smp system, rpm complaining
about things when installing a package:
 line 1574 has invalid context system_u:object_r:spamd_exec_t
/etc/selinux/targeted/contexts/files/file_contexts:  line 1575 has
invalid context system_u:object_r:spamd_exec_t
/etc/selinux/targeted/contexts/files/file_contexts:  line 1576 has
invalid context system_u:object_r:spamd_exec_t
I'll have to investigate a bit more tomorrow if I find the time. 
Booting into previous kernels with the same selinux setup shows no
problems. This is recent, probably started with 2.6.14-rt1.
