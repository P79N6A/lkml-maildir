	A slightly embarrassed glance at the manpage later, I recall
that fact.  Something I never liked about writev(), but that's a moot
point.

	This takes no effort, really, for the kernel.  The block layer
handles it.

	True, but in some senses (and this is application specific) you
want to know that 15/16ths succeeded.  But we're talking about
application needs, not kernel design.  So it's moot for the technical
argument of whether READV is a useful operation.  I just wanted to have
the discussion.  It wasn't an objection per se.

	Why did you submit 64 iocbs of 4K?  Was every page virtually
discontiguous, or did you arbitrarily decide to create a worst-case?
