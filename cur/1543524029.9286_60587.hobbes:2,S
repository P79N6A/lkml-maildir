In 2.3.41 my console is very dark (half brigtness, I think).  Heres my
options:
CONFIG_FB=y
CONFIG_FB_RIVA=y
CONFIG_FB_VESA=y
CONFIG_FBCON_CFB8=y
CONFIG_FBCON_CFB16=y
CONFIG_FBCON_CFB24=y
CONFIG_FBCON_CFB32=y
I also noticed that the penguin is on a white strip in 2.3, but in 2.2 the
area to the right of him is black.  BTW, what sets which penguin is shown?
In 2.2.14 the penguin is drinking some beer :-) but in 2.3 he's the
regular penguin.
Any ideas? FBcon works great in 2.2.14.
