My tuppence worth from a real-time embedded perspective:
A shorter time slice and other real-time improvements to the scheduler will
certainly improve life to the embedded crowd.  Bear in mind that 90% of
processors are used for embedded apps.  Shorter time slices etc. means
smaller buffers, less RAM and lower cost.
I don't know what the current distribution is for Linux regarding embedded
vs data processing, but the embedded use of Linux is certainly growing
rapidly - we expect to make a million thingummyjigs running Linux next year
and there are many other companies doing the same.  Within the next few
years, I expect embedded use of Linux to overshadow data use by a large
margin.
Since embedded processors are 'invisible' and never in the news, I would be
very happy if Linus and others will keep us poor boys in mind...
