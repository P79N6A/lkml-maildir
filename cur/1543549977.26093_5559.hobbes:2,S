Hi everybody,
	I want to develop a linux kernel module in C++ but I don't find makefiles
and/or sorce files examples to do this.
	When I compile the module, the gcc shows a lot of warnings.
	I have tried to use 'extern "C" {}' in my source files, but the result is
the same one.
	For example:
		extern "C" {
		#include <linux/kernel.h>
		}
	Can you help me?
Thanks in advance for your help.
-Abel.
