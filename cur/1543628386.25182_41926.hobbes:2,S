Please see:

What you describe is exactly what snapfs does.  The Sourceforge project
is currently inactive, but the code itself is GPL and only needs some
polishing up and maintenance to be useful (probably also some work to
get it all OK under 2.4 again).  There is already ext2 and ext3 support
for snapfs, and it would probably still be a worthwhile project to add
snapfs support for reiserfs.
Cheers, Andreas
