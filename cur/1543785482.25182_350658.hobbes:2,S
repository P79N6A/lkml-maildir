I would say there is a sixth option, at least in theory: Add some
special symbols like 'LP64' or 'ILP32' to the symbol table, and add
a reference to one of these symbols to every *.o file. The linker
could distinguish between 32bit and 64bit implementation within the
same library. This would be similar to a symbol-versioned library.
But I am not sure whether this would be a reasonable option.
