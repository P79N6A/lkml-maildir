No, that was not the problem. I tried it, bit it did not help.
Later, I noticed the following message that appeared during the boot
process:
Warning: Unable to open an initial console
So, on the NFS server, I made a copy of the NFSROOT-Directory, exported
the copy read-write (the original is exported read-only) and used the
copy as NFSROOT for the client. And now the client works well.
But now I have two questions:
1. Why did the problem not occur with NFS version 2? On the client,
/dev/console should have been read-only with version 2 as well.
2. What can I do to get a "real" solution? Exporting the original
NFSROOT read-write is not possible for me.
