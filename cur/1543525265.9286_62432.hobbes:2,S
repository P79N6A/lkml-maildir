Here is a sample: I've no idea why apt happens to be the great trigger
of this either.

A well-known problem for me.  I end up rebuilding the file list form the
.deb
dpkg never breaks more than one file at a time, as it stops when
encountering
the first broken one.
I got the impression that "truncate" was broken with a race of some kind
when the new pagecache went into 2.3.x  (2.3.7?)  dpkg doing a upgrade
truncates and rewrites a list file for every package upgraded, which
typically
is a lot of files.  And there are lots of other disk activity while this
goes on.
I have the impression that this is one of the things that will be fixed
before
a 2.4.0 release.

They refused a bug report because of the experimental kernel.  It does
not
happen with 2.2.x kernels.  The choice is simple - run the latest and
greatest
with known bugs, or stable old 2.2.x
