This might not be practical for you, but what we're looking for
is people who can reproduce this on a test system where they can
try varying things one-at-a-time.  For example, replace dm-crypt
with dm-linear (e.g. a standard unencrypted LVM2 logical volume); 
replace raid5 with (md) linear.  Also test with the latest 
development kernels to see if recent md patches fixed the problem.
