acpi_driver_detach is calling the acpi_driver.remove() method under
the acpi_device_lock spinlock.
uart_unregister_port() happens to be using a semaphore for its locking.
I do think that it would be better if ACPI were to permit this.  From a
quick peek it appears that acpi_device_lock can simply become a semaphore?
