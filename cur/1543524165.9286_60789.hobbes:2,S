Hi Richard,
THX for Your answer.
With this message I don't want to restart the flames the patch has generated
but only give a response
to Richard.
As I've said before I've only proposed the patch for a discussion ( and what
a discussion ! ).

I've looked the code, it's clear now.

Boot point and delay can be made software tunable, but for a better RT
response
it's better to keep the cluster scheduler running.

The cost is < 0.01 for RQ = 2 ( it uses the same code ).

A cost < 0.01 %, IMVHO, can be tolerable if We've perf boost with longer RQ.
But if we state that longer RQ makes no sense for us, or better that longer
RQ implies
other problems than the scheduler, I can only give a 100% agree here.

As many my messages states I've _only_ reported benchmark or simile
benchmarks
apps and I've expressed my doubt that we will have that RQs in "nature".

I'm one of the most fans of code purism and perfection, so I agree with You
here.
My personal experience looking inside code ( especially in Corporate one
with XXXK lines of code )
is that exist more bad code than good one.

This is a big mistake born inside a previous thread ;)
I've no pipeline app to redesign, it was only an example born inside a
discussion
from me an Larry about the scheduler that has migrated to an SMP one.

<OT>
I use C far from 1985 and it's my favourite language ( as long as C++ and
Assembler ).
I choose one of these depending on what I want to do, for code oriented
projects I use
C, for data oriented project I prefer C++ while when I want 100% code
generation control
I use Assembler.
For project that is not easy to classify I use C.
But probably this is a bit off topic here ;)

Cheers,
Davide.
