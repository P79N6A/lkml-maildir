my boss rememebres reading a very indepth article in one of the msdn 
magazines.  i could scan the articles in and compress them and send them to 
the developers. i want to help the ntfs movement on linux.  would somebody be 
willing to teach me the ropes of reverse engineering of software.  i am a 
faster learner, and very interested in reverse engineering of software.
i have access to the msdn library and maganzies and have lot of free time for 
dedicated ntfs code hacking.
