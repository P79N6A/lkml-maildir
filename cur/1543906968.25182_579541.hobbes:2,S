Whats this about "OSS". OSS or proprietary. And you've been given one
example already - tmpwatch. Although its more of a trash compactor than
HSM.

We have an existing API and ABI thank you. See man mount.

And your Kconfig argument is still not rational. A question I note you
chose not to answer. Anyway if Ubuntu has switched to noatime by default
(or relatime) and hasn't used a Kconfig line that proves my whole point -
we don't need one and its pointless to add so.

Thats a discussion to have with your distribution development team. The
kernel provides the required facilities already. Open source means
everyone can do cool stuff as they see fit and natural selection will do
the rest.
Look I agree entirely with you that relatime, or noatime + minor package
patches is the right thing to do for FC8. I've also pointed out you can
build and release tuning packages for FC 7 and they'll make the
distribution. FC8 beta 1 approaches so now is the time to be talking to
the distribution people and to the ever kernel building Dave Jones about
it.
But none of this makes stupid Kconfig hacks the right answer.
