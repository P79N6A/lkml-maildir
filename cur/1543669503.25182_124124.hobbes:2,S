What type is the link partner (switch,hub,network card)? Type of cable
(crossover,plain)? How high is the traffic on the network?
Judging from your mii-tool output, you are connected to
1. a 10MBit hub or
2. a 100MBit hub and one of the connected network cards is 10MBit or
3. a 10MBit network card.
If neither of these is the case, please check your cabling.
Regards,
Carl-Daniel
