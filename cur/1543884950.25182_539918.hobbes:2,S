How often has the implementation changed? I think i_rdev has been
there for a looong time. But yes, doing the MAJOR => imajor conversion
is preferable. Because you don't need the struct declaration for inode
then, and may omit to #include <linux/fs.h>. (Other things may need
fs.h so it's a bit of a corner case.)
