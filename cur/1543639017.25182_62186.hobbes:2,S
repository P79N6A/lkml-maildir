OK, so what is an example of a real application that does tons of forking?
We need to get numbers for that.  We also need to compare such numbers to
the supposed advantage in swapping.

Problem: we went and gave away the page when we swapped it out, but yes,
we could save the pte chain somewhere and maybe that's a win.  It would
eat memory just when we're trying to get some back, though.

High sharing levels are exactly where the swap-in problem is going to
rear its ugly head.
