That means that the starting of the child process needs to be  
synchronized by the application itself. I tried it once but then I  
discovered that my case was easily solved in a completely different  
way (it was a very small project). However, which one is the easiest/ 
fastest way to do this synchronization? Using SysV-Semaphores? Pipes?  
Would something like this work?
int fd[2], pid;
pipe(fd);
pid = fork();
if (pid < 0) {
   error();
} else if (pid == 0) {
   close(fd[1]);
   read(fd[0]);
   close(fd[0]);
   child_code();
} else {
   store_pid();
   close(fd[0]);
   close(fd[1]); // this should wake up the child, right?
}
This should ensure that store_pid() is executed before child_code()...
Ciao,

UNIX was not designed to stop you from doing stupid things, because that
would also stop you from doing clever things.
