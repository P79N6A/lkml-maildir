I agree with that, too.
It is easy, too, because the sysctl mechanism has a built-in bounds
checking function.
For the seventh parameter (the parsing mechanism) you can specify
something like proc_dointvec_minmax and then the last parameters can be
&one and NULL.  This forces the minimum value to be one.
So its trivial and built-in.  While root should be able to wreck the
system, he should at least have a chance in hell of knowing he is doing
so.  Zero may seem to be a legitimate value here...
