I'll leave that up to Ingo of course, and certainly have no problem with
them burning in mm.  However, I must say that I personally classify
these two changes as being trivial and obviously correct enough to be
included in 2.6.16.  I realize that mm is different in this area (we
talked about it), but the problems addressed by this patch still remain.
Anyway, let's wait and see if it fixes Lee's problem.
