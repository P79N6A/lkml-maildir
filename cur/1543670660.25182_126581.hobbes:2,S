Just think s/major/dev_lo/g and s/minor/dev_hi/g.  This is the
represantation for a legacy protocol.  Just because fat thinks
of a filename as 8+3 Linux filenames don't have to be that format.

Umm, no.  You're far to major/minor biased to realized live get a lot
sipler for use if we don't do any complicated mapping of old dev_t
to the larger dev_t.  With the proper ranges we can just map it
numerically 1:1 to the new dev_t.  Yes, that means it's all in one
new "major".  But who cares?
