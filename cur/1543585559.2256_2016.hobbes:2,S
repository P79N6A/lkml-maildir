Is the computer otherwise idle?
I've seen one unexplainable report with atm problems that disappeared
(!) if a kernel compile was running.
Could you try to run a simple cpu hog (with nice 20)?

main()

I'm aware of one bug that could cause a delay of up to 20 ms (cpu_idle()
doesn't check for pending softirq's before sleeping), but that doesn't
explain your 500 ms delay.
