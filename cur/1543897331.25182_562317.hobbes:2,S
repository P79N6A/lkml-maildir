Subject: [GIT PATCH] USB fixes for 2.6.22-rc6
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Here are some USB fixes against your 2.6.22-rc6 tree.
They fix a pretty serious gadget file_storage bug, some minor bugs in
other drivers (although the "suck up all kernel memory in the system" is
pretty nasty...) and adds 2 new device ids.
All of these have been in the -mm releases for a while.
Please pull from:
	master.kernel.org:/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/usb-2.6.git/
The full patches will be sent to the linux-usb-devel mailing list, if
anyone wants to see them.
thanks,
greg k-h
