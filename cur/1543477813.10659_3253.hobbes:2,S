I just seen that some weeks ago. The reason I have not fixed it at that
time is because I thought it's supposed to be used only in single threaded
code paths.  Basically it's _only_ used in the cleanup_module or other
obviosly single threaded code.
And I don't really worry about that bug because it's _far_ to be subtle. 
You'll see a nice Oops that tell you exactly what happened without
mistakes, and in some seconds you'll fix the bug in the driver.

That's not a big problem because it's in the cleanup_module(). So it's far
to harm during real production. Having a race when doing a cleanup_module
is not the worse thing we could have ;).

Agreed, it will make the code more robust with a tiny overhead. I repost
here the _whole_ fix for the bottom-half-function SMP races. I think this
should go in fast to avoid maintainers of other archs to fix things two
times ;)
