Thanks, that looks good, and it now passes my randomized testsuite.
If you are interested, my test code is at:
  
http://samba.org/ftp/unpacked/junkcode/idtree/
Note that I made idr_remove() and sub_remove() return an int for
success/failure, as that was more useful for my code, and it also
means we skip the layer free logic on remove failure (not that it does
any harm, just seems a bit of a loose end).
Cheers, Tridge
