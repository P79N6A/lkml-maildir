>Anyone volunteers write battery layer? If so, I'd go with /dev/XXX,
I'd like to take a swing at it.
If it catches on, I'd be happy to maintain it.
I think we should be able to make different underlying battery
instrumentation make sense to user-space -- even Zaurus-style systems.
I'm not religious about /dev vs. /sys.  At the end of the day I think
that an easy and consistent programming I/F between user and kernel
is the highest priority, and at the moment for this type of thing
I think /dev is simpler than /proc or /sys files.  But if using
/dev has some fatal flaw, I'll be happy to change to /sys.
Also, there is no law that says we can't do some of both
if that turns out to be useful.
