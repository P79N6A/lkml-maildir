Hi,
This series corresponds do older patches in the paravirt series
that was neither already applied, nor I will touch again. In general,
they do not touch code that can be unified (at least, without being the
unification a big problem on its own).
They passed through this list a lot of times, so I feel them ready for
inclusion, unless someone opposes. 
As with the other patches, they apply to the top of linux-2.6-x86:mm
