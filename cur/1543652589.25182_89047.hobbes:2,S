Add alpha, parisc, sparc and so on. ;-)
pci_dev->sysdata needs to be moved as well, but not only.
It seems that two things are fundamentally missing in generic
device model:
1. clean way to detect the type of container structure from arbitrary
   struct device *;
2. parent/child relationship between devices of different bus types.
Example (not exactly real life, but close enough):
to do DMA mapping properly for, say, some legacy device, I need to know
that it's sitting behind ISA-to-PCI bridge X belonging in PCI domain Y of
the root-level IO controller Z.
