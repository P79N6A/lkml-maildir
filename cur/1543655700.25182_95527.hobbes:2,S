I agree that the design of the /dev/fbX interface is not the best.
Unfortunely we are stuck with it. Changing it would break userland apps.

I should of worded that better. Meaning I have to see what X is doing so
the fbdev driver sets the state itself better. Hm. I'm thinking about the
mmap approach versus the fb_open approach being used now.

:-( True. We should always assume X or any userland app could be broken.
