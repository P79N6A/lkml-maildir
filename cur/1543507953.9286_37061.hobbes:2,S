I strongly agree that an NFS which is stable and compatible with the
non-Linux universe would be worth changing tools many times over.  When
this is moved into the kernel, (soon I hope) I would also recommend the
patches needed to support the new autofs by Jeremy Fitzhardinge
<jeremy@goop.org>, as this version will go a long way towards making
Linux enterprise ready.
Jermey and HJ Lu have done the work (many thanks) but it is currently a
major chore to put it altogether.  Please merge the changes in.  If you
want to blame someone, feel free to forward all the gripes about
incompatible tools to me and I will respond to them with my usual tact.
(Alan Cox shouldn't have to take all of the heat in addition to
everything else he does :-) )
