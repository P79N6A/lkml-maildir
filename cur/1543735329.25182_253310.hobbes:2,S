Ouch - persuasive - well presented - thanks.
On the flip side, I am not finding any firm basis in the concerns I had
that led me down the other path.
Give me a few hours to run this through a bit of unit testing on my
side, then I will likely endorse your patch.
I have two minor patches on my side:
 1) add CONFIG_CPUSETS=y to sn2_defconfig, and
 2) remove some more casts of (void *)d_fsdata.
If it's ok by you, and I don't have any more questions, I will send all
three along to Andrew, as a set, in a few hours.
Good work, Simon.
