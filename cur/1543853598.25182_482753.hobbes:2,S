what point would there be in using it? It's not like the kernel could 
make use of the thread keyword anytime soon (it would need /all/ 
architectures to support it) ... and the kernel doesnt mind how the 
current per_cpu() primitives are implemented, via assembly or via C. In 
any case, it very much matters to see the precise cost of having the pda 
selector value in %gs versus %fs.
