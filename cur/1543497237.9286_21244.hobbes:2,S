sorry, I confused with 16-bit, so reinforcing my opinion, 32 bits its the
best option, 64 bits never, will much increase the size of kernel.
16bit = 0 to 2^32 = 0 to 65,535
32bit = 0 to 2^32 = 0 to 4,294,967,296
64bit = 0 to 2^64 = 0 to 18,446,744,073,709,551,616  
so what machine will have 18,446,744,073,709,551,616 of users? :-)
