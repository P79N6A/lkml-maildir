Wow, I didn't expect it to be that difficult, I'm sorry about that. :)
Next time I'll split it apart into the basic parts, so it should be easier 
to read and follow.

I didn't suggest that, the function itself is already quite generic and 
could be called like "clock_update(cycles);". What I'm suggesting is to 
make it a template function, so that one create a optimized version based 
on some parameters (e.g. it's possible to optimize some parts away by 
making them constant).
That's not really necessary for the first version, only that a clock can 
call the "clock_update(cycles);" directly from it's interrupt handler, 
later it can be replaced with an optimized version.

Now I'm really curious. :)

Not yet, but it would only minor updates (mostly documenting it better and 
cleanups as you suggested), the basic stuff is still the same.

There is no real dependency on HZ, it's just that the synchronisations 
steps and incremental updates are done in fixed intervals. The interval 
could easily be independent of HZ.
