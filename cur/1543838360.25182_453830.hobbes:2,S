I can't ascertain that this is exactly true.
For example, in isdn_writebuf_skb_stub() we have this:
	if (ret > 0) {
 ...
		if (dev->v110[idx]) {
 ...
			if (ret == skb->len)
				dev_kfree_skb(skb);
So if ret > 0 and we're doing V.110, we only free the skb
if isdn_v110_encode put a value at *((int *)nskb->data)
equal to skb->len.
So in the V.110 case it's not purely the ->writebuf_skb() return
value that gets returned, rather we return that integer that
isdn_v110_encode() put there.
Therefore I don't think this SKB leak is %100 correct.  What did
I miss?
BTW, this ISDN code is rotting a bit and could use some cleanups if
not a rewrite. :-/
