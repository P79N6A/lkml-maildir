Currently there is a way for userland to determine if a hotplug event 
they receive is due to an EEH slot isolation event.  It's not very 
pretty and requires the rtas_errd daemon to be running.
The RTAS event generated from the EEH event is logged to 
/var/log/platform by rtas_errd.  Userland scripts would have to search 
the file for a recent EEH event matching their device to make this 
determination.  This isn't as nice as a direct notification but is what 
we have at this point.
