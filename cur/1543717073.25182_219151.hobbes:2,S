That is _not_ the proper way to build a kernel module.  Please read the
Linux Device Drivers for examples of how to do this the correct way
(it's availble online for free.)

Did you read the release notes about how to move to the 2.6 kernel?  I
recommend using that one for development, as the USB interface is nicer,
and faster, and the build process is _vastly_ simpler.
Also, this belongs on the linux-usb-devel mailing list, not here.
