The problem is only mis-linked device file.
	# My cdrom can be accessed with /dev/sr0, which is
	# SCSI CD-ROM driver.  For previous compatibility,
	# I make a symbolic link /dev/sr0 to /dev/cdrom,
	# and they works fine.
Device files under devfs are dynamically generated by kernel, right?
For some representative devices, I think, the symbolic links are
also made for user's convenience.  "cdrom0" and "sr0" are such
links, I think.  On my environment, "sr0" has proper link to
actual one, but "cdrom0" do not.
The kernel might generate these links, right?
So I wonder there are some bugs.
Considering the behavior when I boot without ide-scsi, I think
proper place, where "cdrom0" is placed, is /dev/cdroms/cdrom0.
If so, the link "cdrom0 -> ../scsi/host0/bus0/target0/lun0/cd"
become ok.
Sorry for bad explanation in English.
