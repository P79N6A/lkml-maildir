Yes, that still seems to be there:
  udp_poll
  ->spin_lock_irq()
  ->udp_checksum_complete
    ->__udp_checksum_complete
      ->skb_checksum
        ->kmap_skb_frag
          ->local_bh_disable
That local_bh_disable() in kmap_skb_frag() looks weird and might be
unnecessary.  Does anyone know what it's there for?  Replace it with
local_irq_save()?
