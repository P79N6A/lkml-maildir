Using that framework was the intention (you used a CONFIG_
prefix there, and so did I), but as I wasn't sure about its status,
and as I also was doing this against plain 2.6.18-rc6, I didn't add
the actual detection logic. Actually I also think that should be
done a little differently to allow for better future extension, i.e.
instead of adding to CFLAGS store the auto-detected results in
a header and forcibly -include it.

I didn't create it against your quilt tree, that's true.

In order to deal with gcc's somewhat broken handling of noreturn
functions (the call instruction in which may be immediately followed
by a subsequent function, thus leading to the call's return address
pointing into that [wrong] function), add heuristics to the unwinder
to distinguish standard call frames from syscall, exception, or
interruption ones. Also provide for utilizing newer gas'
.cfi_signal_frame for non-heuristic based detection, pending
addition of the respective assembler feature detection logic.
