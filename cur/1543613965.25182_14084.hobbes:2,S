Never mind that it might save a great deal of space...
I often operate with three/more different kernel trees, but the differences 
are often trivial.
If the VFS created a COW node when I use cp -a I would, obviously, save a 
great deal of space; this goes for numerous other source trees too.
Now there's a real world example for you.
