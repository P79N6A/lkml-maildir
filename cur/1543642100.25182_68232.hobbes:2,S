I agree, but why is there such a check for mounting the root file 
system during startup. After removing the check from
prepare_namespace(), rd_load_image() will still get called with
"/dev/root" as argument and "/dev/root" should allready be pointing to
ROOT_DEV.  The target I'm working on is using a ramdisk for it's root
file system, however, it's not using initrd.
