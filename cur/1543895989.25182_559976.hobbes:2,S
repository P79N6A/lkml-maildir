if it was the GNU that made linux what it is today and the linux kernel 
mearly an oppurtunist then the GNU/Hurd, GNU/Solaris, GNU/BSD and for that 
matter GNU/Microsoft distributions should be steadily and quickly gaining 
marketshare
oh, sorry, people barely know that they exist (including people convinced 
that the linux kernel is junk compared to Solaris) and they are little 
more than proof-that-it-can-be-done showpieces.
it was the ability of the linux kernel to adapt to vastly different 
hardware (including embeded hardware) that made Linux what it is today.
and I do mean 'Linux" not 'GNU/Linux' in the statement above.
