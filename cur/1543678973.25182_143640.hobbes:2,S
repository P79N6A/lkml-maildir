My intuition agrees with yours, but if this is true then andrea's old
elevator-lowlatency patch alone is enough, and we don't need q->full at
all.  Users continued to complain of bad latencies even with his code
applied.

wakeup code for get_request latencies and provides good throughput. 
There are a few cases where batch wakeup has shorter overall latencies,
but I don't think people were in those heavy workloads while they were
complaining of stalls in -aa.

I agree here too, it just doesn't match the user reports we've been
getting in 2.4 ;-)  If 2.5 can dynamically allocate requests now and
then you can get much better results with io contexts/dynamic wakeups,
but I can't see how to make it work in 2.4 without larger backports.
So, the way I see things, we've got a few choices.
1) do nothing.  2.6 isn't that far off.
2) add elevator-lowlatency without q->full.  It solves 90% of the
problem
3) add q->full as well and make it the default.  Great latencies, not so
good throughput.  Add userland tunables so people can switch.
4) back port some larger chunk of 2.5 and find a better overall
solution.
I vote for #3, don't care much if q->full is on or off by default, as
long as we make an easy way for people to set it.
