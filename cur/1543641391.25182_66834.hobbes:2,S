So, what do all of you think of the following implementation?
#1 The "policy modules" (/proc-interface, kernel-based frequency selector,
...) determine the target CPU frequency.
#2 This is then passed to the cpufreq core. There it is validated, 
loops_per_jiffy and other values  are adjusted.
#3 Then the cpufreq driver is called to actually set the CPU frequency.
#3 is absolutely ready, #2 in parts (the "policy module" interface is
missing, and the /proc-interface needs to be removed), and #1 is TBD.
Comments?
