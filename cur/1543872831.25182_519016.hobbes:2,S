I still didn't get anything wrong pointed out with the patch, though.
I'm not arguing against using hrtimers here to fix it the "right way".

I don't see what is kludgy, unless you consider converting to and from
absolute timeouts. But the userspace API is relative time based, so
hrtimers doesn't change that.

There is no rush to use hrtimers. I would have thought it fairly important
to actually reach correctness, though. We're not talking about completely
changing the design of something such that it will take a lot of work to
"fix it properly". If that were the issue, then I would consider the
hrtimer conversion as part of the fix.
And if you talk about doing it the right way, then I don't think it is
strictly the right way to reimplement the function, including known bugs,
to be slightly more efficient, and *then* fixing those bugs. I'd actually
consider it better to fix the bugs first, not only because of the backport
issue, but because it generally makes it easier to track the injection and
removal points of bugs in the history.
