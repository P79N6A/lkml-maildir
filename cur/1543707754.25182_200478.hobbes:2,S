hm, right. So for the lookup to be lockless, it would have to be managed
via a syscall variant similar in mechanism to the two-bit approach you 
suggested:
	ret = sys_manage_dir_cache(fd, op);
where the following cache states are defined:
	(invalid, refill_in_progress, valid)
the following type of cache ops are defined:
	(lookup, cache_filled)
the semantics of the sys_manage_dir_cache() syscall are the following:
- op is 'lookup': the syscall returns 'valid' if state is valid. If the 
  state is 'refill_in_progress' then lookup returns refill_in_progress. 
  If the state is 'invalid', then the state goes to 'refill_in_progress' 
  and 'invalid' is returned.
- op is 'cache_filled': the syscall moves the state to 'valid' if state
  is still 'refill_in_progress'. It goes to 'refill_in_progress' if the
  state was 'invalid'.
the kernel does the valid->invalid and refill_in_progress->invalid
transitions automatically, when relevant VFS events occur. All dentries
start out in state invalid.
there's another class of problems: is it an issue that directory renames
that move this directory (higher up in the directory hierarchy of this
directory) do not invalidate the cache? In that case there's no dnotify
event either.
