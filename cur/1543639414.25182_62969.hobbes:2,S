ksymoops is scanning for (oops.c line 361)
              "([<(]?)"                 /* 2 */
              "([0-9a-fA-F]+)"          /* 3 */
              "[)>]?"
              " *"
The trailing [)>] is required but any space after that is optional.  It

Disassembling arm as i386 is pointless, but it shows that ksymoops
2.4.5 recognises () as the last code fragment.
