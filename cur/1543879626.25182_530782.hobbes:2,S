Hi, 
I don't have the original message just my reply, 
I had try a FC6-respin dvd.iso ( which have kernel 2.6.20) in my old
laptop (
http://sergiomb.no-ip.org/laptop/
 ) which need "VIA IRQ quirk
fixup"  and I had many problems with booting after dig a little I found
that quirks aren't applied anymore .
So the latest patch of Alan Cox on this subject which is already on
kernel 2.6.20, hasn't been tested and doesn't work on my laptop and
probably in all compaq pressario 700 , I think.
Thanks,
