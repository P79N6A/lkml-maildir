that's odd.  the selection for kernel .config support has been in
the red hat config menus for at least the last release, as well
as the extraction script .../scripts/extract-ikconfig.  but this
never worked due to a missing "binoffset" utility.  i even filed
a bugzilla on that (bug 65677).
just curious -- how did that ever end up in the distributed red hat
kernel if it was never standard?  strange.
