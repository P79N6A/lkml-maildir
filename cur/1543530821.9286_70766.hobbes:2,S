I am running Slackware 7 stock, and am having trouble compiling kernel
2.3.99pre1  When I try to compile it with the Direct Rendering Manager
compiled into the kernel it craps out with the following.  I have tried it
on 2 slack 7 boxes, one with a Guillemot Maxi Gamer Phoenix AGP card, and
the other with a 2 meg S3 PCI card.
