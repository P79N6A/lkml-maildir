OK, so the ability to run RT tasks implies the ability to possibly
corrupt data.  It appears that this can't be fixed until we have a real
isochronous scheduling class; for the forseeable future RT tasks will
need SCHED_FIFO and nonroot users will need to run them.
Anyway it's good to see the problem finally being taken seriously.
