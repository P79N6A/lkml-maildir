	I think it would be easy to fix.. He wrote this:
/lib/modules/2.4.19-pre4-ac1/build/include/linux/malloc.h:4: #error
linux/malloc.h is deprecated, use linux/slab.h instead.
make[2]: *** [driver.d] Error 1
	So change in the file where it appeared the 
#include <linux/malloc.h> 
to
#include <linux/slab.h>
