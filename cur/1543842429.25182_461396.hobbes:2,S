Bisection is probably not necessary anymore. The issue seems to be much
older than -mm's changes to nodemgr. Please apply the patches
    ieee1394: nodemgr: fix rwsem recursion
    ieee1394: nodemgr: grab class.subsys.rwsem in nodemgr_resume_ne
on top of all of -mm. I posted them yesterday but will mail them again.
(linux1394-devel was kept in the dark by SpamCop.) Thanks a lot for your
help.
