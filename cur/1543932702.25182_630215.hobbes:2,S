The current code looks like that to minimize impact on 2.6.24, see this
branch:
http://git.kernel.dk/?p=linux-2.6-block.git;a=shortlog;h=sg
for how it folds into lib/sg.c and the magic disappears from SCSI.
Rusty, nobody claimed the sg code in 2.6.24 is perfect. I like to get
things incrementally there.
