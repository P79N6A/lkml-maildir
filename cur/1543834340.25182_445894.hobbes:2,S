It does nothing for you yet, it is just step one for getting the DRM and 
framebuffer drivers to co-exist in the driver model world, with the next 
step being allowing a channel of communication between the two layers with 
a view that later I can ask the DRM to disable fbdev or pass info to it..
Why do we not want fbdev and DRM in one driver? as it would break way too 
many existing systems..
It also allows DRM to get called at suspend/resume time.
Dave.
