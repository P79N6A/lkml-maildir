Subject: [PATCH] off-by-1 error in ide-probe (2.4.x)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

There is a potentially serious bug in ide-probe.c in which max_sectors
is set to 256 instead of 255.  I am surprised that this hasn't bit anyone
else yet.  Perhaps because you need a disk that is slow in comparison to 
the host in order for the queue to climb up to and then hit the 256, at
which point it then falls over.  
For example, with an old 700MB Maxtor on a "fast" 486, VL-bus, PIO, 
hdparm -c1 -m8 -u1, I could pretty much on demand generate the following 
error by multiple builds, or by the final linking of any big project:
   hdc: lost interrupt
   hdc: status error: status=0x58 { DriveReady SeekComplete DataRequest }
   hdc: drive not ready for command
   <user space sees binary cruft in source files, etc etc...>
(Note that nothing in the status is really an error).  With the following 
patch, everything works as it should & no errors even under high load.
Patch is against 2.4.3pre2.
Paul.
