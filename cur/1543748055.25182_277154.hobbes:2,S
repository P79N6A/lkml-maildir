I have stopped reporting the -mm issues using bugizlla exactly for this 
reason.  Apparently, the reports get more attention when they are sent to 
LKML. ;-)

Yes, but many things are not reported there anyway.  IMVHO the bugzilla is an 
overkill for -mm bug reporting.  The -mm kernels are released too often, they 
change too much, and the issues are often too simple to be reported this way.
