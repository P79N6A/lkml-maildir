Subject: 2.5.12-dj1:  IDE trouble - RZ1000 still won't finish booting

I posted a log about this about a week ago regarding
Linux 2.5.10 not completing boot on an older system with a
RZ1000 IDE interface.   (and that RZ1000 by itself, w/ CMD640
and generic PCI IDE disabled in make config, wouldnt even
compile  -- it still doesnt with 2.5.12-dj1)
It still crashes at the same place - when the root
filesystem is remounted with R/W.   The messages look different,
i.e. the "unexpected interrupt <x> <y>" is gone, but it looks
like it's still complaining about the same thing:
hda: task_mulout_intr: error=0x04  { DriveStatusError }
then several of these:
   { task_mulout_intr }
hda:  ide_set_handler: handler not null  old=<some hex> new=<some other hex>
bug: kernel timer added twice
finally:
end_request: I/O error, dev 03:00, sector 456628
end_buffer_io_sync: I/O error
hda: ata_irq_request: hwgroup was not busy!?
Unable to hand kernel NULL pointer dereference...
...and the usual dumpage.    (which isnt logged, naturally)
