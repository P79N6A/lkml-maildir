OK, I put the ISO image and the udf checker outputs on BitTorrent,
the torrent file is avaliable at
http://lizika.pfmb.uni-mb.si/~stein/UDF_image_and_reports.torrent
In case you don't have a BitTorrent client, one can be had at
http://bitconjurer.org/BitTorrent/download.html
( even a commandline version , written in python )
Regards,
David
