You don't need any more sources that that, all it does is to add
complexity and hide what is really going on.

Rubbish, the current case we are talking about is serial performance
vs the rest of the system. Run the serial as high priority and the
rest as slow - you don't need this for mouse, disk, ethernet etc.
