Hi,
I am running 2.2.12 and am running PPP 2.3.7 over a PCMCIA modem
(PCMCIA 3.0.14).  My machine has begun hanging recently.  I'm  
not sure what changes preceeded the start of the hangs.
The hangs seem to occur when I have an active PPP data transfer
combined with mouse movement or some keyboard activity.
Anyhow, I have no idea how to track down the problem since I
don't get an OOPS message or error message of any kind.  Rather,
everything freezes (disk, keyboard, mouse).  I have to cold boot.
Do I need to set up some special kernel debugging configuration?
O have ready the oops-tracing and other kernel documentation,
but this particular situation was not addressed.
Thanks,
	Miles
