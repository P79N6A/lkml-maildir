Sorry, but I just don't see why we need all this complexity and generality.
If there was any likelihood that there would be additional memory domains
in the 2.6 future then OK.  But I don't think there will be.  We simply
need some little old patch which fixes this bug.
Such as adding a `vma' arg to vm_enough_memory() and vm_unacct_memory() and
doing
	if (is_vm_hugetlb_page(vma))
		return;
and
-	allowed = totalram_pages * sysctl_overcommit_ratio / 100;
+	allowed = (totalram_pages - htlbpagemem << HPAGE_SHIFT) *
+			sysctl_overcommit_ratio / 100;
in cap_vm_enough_memory().
