Linus is doing lots of work already. He gets more mail than he can
read. He has to be selective about what he himself does. He sometimes
releases kernels that he hasn't even compiled himself, just to reduce
the "testing burdon" on himself. That's a good thing. 
Feel free to make an automatic "does it compile" test, and report the
problems.
Feel free to try to arrange a cooperation with Linus where he releases
a kernel first to you where you get to give the "yes it compiles for
Felix" approval.

Some filesystem changes were made. It broke all filesystems. Everybody
knows that. The FAT filesystem wasn't fixed yet. Your problem.
