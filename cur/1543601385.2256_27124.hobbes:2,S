I meant "zone->freepages.high" (or something like that... you get the
idea). 
My point is: we're not going to start aging pte's until we have a
zone shortage, right ?
With the old scheme, we would differentiate "inactive shortage" from "free
shortage".

I really think this will cause problems in practice, Andrea.
Moreover, the whole active_local_lru has a _bad_ effect on writeout
clustering:
shrink_cache() callers on low classzone can "hide" pages from higher
classzone callers and avoid clustering. Look:
We have a nice big sequentially ordered list of pages to writeout. 
lowzone shrink_cache() moves higher zones pages (from this ordered list)
to its inactive/active_local_lru until it calls schedule() (due to
need_resched()). (for example)
Now we have a higher classzone caller which finds "half of the block" and
writes it out.
>From this point on, we breaked in half an ordered list of pages which
could be nicely merged together at ll_rw_block().
The example I gave which splits one sequentially ordered list of pages in
two blocks is a simple and "stupid" one. But think how badly can we have
pages ordered during a long time of VM activity.
