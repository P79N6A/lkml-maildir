I don't see a argument that locks that get to fine grained are not an
issue.  However even traditional version of single cpu unix are multi
threaded.  The locking in a multi cpu design just makes that explicit.
And the only really nasty place to get locks is when you get a
noticeable number of them in your device drivers.  With the core code
you can fix it without out worrying about killing the OS.

Proactive don't add a lock unless you can really justify that you need
it.  That is well suited to open source code review type practices,
and it appears to be what we are doing now.  And if you don't add
locks you certainly don't get into a lock tangle.
As for 100% history supported all I see is that evolution of code,
as it dynamically gathers the requirements instead of magically
knowing them does much better than design as a long term 
strategy.  Of course you design the parts you can see but every has a
limited ability to see the future.
To specifics, I don't see the point of OSlets on a single cpu that is
hyper threaded.  Traditional threading appears to make more sense to
me.  Similarly I don't see the point in the 2-4 cpu range.
Given that there are some scales when you don't want/need more than
one kernel, who has a machine where OSlets start to pay off?  They
don't exist in commodity hardware, so being proactive now looks
stupid.
The only practical course I see is to work on solutions that work on
clusters of commodity machines.  At least any one who wants one can
get one.  If you can produce a single system image, the big iron guys
can tweak the startup routing and run that on their giant NUMA or SMP
machines.
