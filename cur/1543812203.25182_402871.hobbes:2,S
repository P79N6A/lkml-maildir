As more information has come to light, the worst case
"big transfer" of a single SCSI command through sg (and
st I suspect) is 512 KB **. With full coalescing that figure
goes up to 4 MB **. I am also aware that some users
increase SG_SCATTER_SZ in the sg driver to get larger
"big transfer"s than sg's current limit of (8MB - 32KB) **.
That facility has now gone (i.e. upping SG_SCATTER_SZ will
have no effect) with no replacement mechanism.
So I'll add my vote to "revert this change before lk 2.6.16"
with a view to applying it after some solution to the "big
transfer" problem is found.
In 8 years of maintaining the sg driver I cannot remember
anybody contacting me regarding the way the sg driver ignored
the DISABLE_CLUSTERING flag; that was until Mike Christie raised
it yesterday with regard to iscsi_tcp ***. Gerard's post from
2000 implied clustering was not a problem with U160 (SPI-3)
so perhaps it was for SPI-2 (1998) or SPI (1995) or SCSI-2 (1993).
If so those are pretty old symbios controllers. Why would any
storage manufacturer make a DMA element that was restricted
to Intel's i386 page size per transfer?
I suspect there are a small number of high power users
that need "big transfers" and they will get a surprise
in lk 2.6.16 if things stay as they are.

I believe the sg and st drivers share these problems as would
osst and ch if they tried to send a lot of data in one command.
Firmware loading comes to mind.
** these figures assume ".sg_tablesize" in the corresponding low level
driver is at least 128. If not, scale those figures down proportionally.
*** I believe the iscsi_tcp driver is emulating DMA and Mike
Christie said yesterday that code could be added to that driver
to support "clustering" (i.e. scatter gather element sizes larger
than page size).
