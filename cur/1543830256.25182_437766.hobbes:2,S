Partly because when I did consider switching to /sys, I found it to be 
incomprehensible (even with the LWN articles and Documentation/ files). 
Jonathan's articles and LCA presentation did help me start to get a better 
grip, but then it just didn't seem to be worth the effort. I have two simple 
relatively simple routines that handle all my proc entries at the moment, so 
that adding a new entry is just a matter of adding an element in an array of 
structs (saying what variable is being read/written, what type, min/max 
values and side effect routines, eg). It looked to me like changing to sysfs 
was going to require me to have a separate routine for every sysfs entry, 
even though they'd all have those some basic features. Maybe I'm just 
ignorant. Please tell me I am and point me in the right direction.
Regards,
Nigel
