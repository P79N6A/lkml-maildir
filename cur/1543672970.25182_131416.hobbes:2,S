As if there are so many apps that would suffer from that...
Anyway, what's so bad about the idea someone (Linus?) suggested?
Without MAP_FIXED the address given to mmap is already taken as a
hint where to start looking for free memory.  So use mmap(4GB,...)
for regular memory and mmap(4kB, ...) for stacks.  What's wrong
with that?  And if you are really frightend to run out of "low"
memory make the above-4GB allocation the default for addr==0.
Ciao, ET.
