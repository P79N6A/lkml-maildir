    Yes, it sure looks like something isn't right here.  I think we probably
used to use "spintime" for this purpose, but now there is a boolean flag
"spintime" and a "spintime_value".  I think you are right that we just need
to move the initialization of spintime_value out of the loop - probably to
the same place that spintime is getting initialized.
