i've already implemented it for FRAME_POINTERS (i really needed it to 
not go insane when looking at lock validator output).
As you suggested a few weeks ago the real solution would be a dwarf 
parser. Maybe ia64's could be taken? Will post the patch for the 
FRAME_POINTERS solution soon. Sample output:

(and it works fine across irq/exception stacks too.)

i certainly used exact backtraces on i386 for many many years. Not sure 
whether those patches were all upstream though. It's also the 
combination of effects that makes the difference between i386 and x86_64 
so striking.
furthermore, the kernel's debugging infrastructure improved 
significantly, and we get more and more stackdumps to interpret [instead 
of hard to debug corruptions, etc.].

i have no problems with interpreting occasional non-exact backtraces, 
but it is certainly non-obvious, and when you are looking at backtraces 
en masse, the unnecessary repetitive task can get really distracting and 
frustrating.
Exact backtraces on the other hand almost immediately create a unique 
and reliable "visual fingerprint", and if you have looked at enough of 
them, you almost recognize them just from looking at the shape of them. 
It's a completely different 'experience'. (and userspace developers will 
laugh out loud at us now i suspect ...)

yeah.
