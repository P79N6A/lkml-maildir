Ahh... that's an interesting point. You aren't saving kernel text. I'm
not sure how that could be a problem for me. I think i'll just save it
along with the image though. I think there is much risk screwing up
because an uncompatible boot/load kernel pair here than because devices
aren't fully idle.
