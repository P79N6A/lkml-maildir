Subject: Question on IOCTL hooks.

Currently, my VLAN code creates a file: /proc/net/vlan/config,
and I have attached an IOCTL hook to that file, such that when
an ioctl call is done on that file, my method is called...
However, davem wants VLAN to be able to function w/out the
/proc fs.  So, I need to know how to ensure my IOCTL
code can be called on any (or some other) file.
Can someone suggest a piece of code or documentation that
I should look at for the 'right way' to do this?
Also, any suggestions as to how to pick an IOCTL that is
guaranteed not to conflict with someone else's IOCTL?
Thanks,
Ben
