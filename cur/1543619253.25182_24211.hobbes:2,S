It's certainly possible and there are changes we could make to make it more
useful.  Right now, there is no record of a change if it goes and then gets
rejected right back out; it's as if you patched and then you did a reverse
patch.
The good news is that each change (patch) has an identifier, they look like
    awc@bitmover.bitmover.com|ChangeSet|20011230212716|39200
and if we kept a record of those that were rejected, it would be trivial for
a developer to track whether his change was in/not seen/rejected.
