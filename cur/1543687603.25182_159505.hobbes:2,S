Hi Tim,
Fact is that I am just now starting to look at 2.6 and the issues relating 
to it wrt autofs.
Perhaps you (or someone else) could help by giving me a 5 cent tour of the 
issues as you see them.

Customers are having trouble with it.
One of them would be me.
As you have seen on the autofs list I have been working to improve Sun 
<-> Linux automount integration for some time now and while I don't have a 
complete solution I have made significant progress, in an operational 
sense.
With luck and effort I expect to have a release available soonish.

This sounds very interesting but I am deep into getting an operational 
release for the 2.4 kernel right now. Anything I can do, at least for a 
while, will be a cursory survey.
