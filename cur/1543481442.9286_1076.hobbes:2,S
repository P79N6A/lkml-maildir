You and I know the kernel has been Y2K complient forever.
But to be fair, Linux (as a whole, especially including the GNU utils)
was not _audited_ for Y2K compliance until last year.
So it makes sense to claim Y2K now.  Even though it is not really to do
with the kernel, which has always been Y2K compliant as far as I know.
[Related - does Linux work around BIOSes and/or hardware clocks that
don't roll over the century at Y2K?  It will be bad if lots of PCs
are powered down on Dec 31st, powered up on Jan 1st, and the Linux ones
are the ones reporting Jan 01, 1900 while the MS ones get the time right].

I prefer Internet.  It's a big and important thing, worth drawing the eye to.

Agreed it is awkward sounding.  But many web servers would probably not
exist without Linux -- it really does enable some applications.  I can't
think of a better phrase than yours though.

Agreed 100%.
Trim the second quote to Linux, "due to it's open source code - has a
long term credibility which exceeds many other competitive OS's."
Spell "author" right.
You can trim the odd word here or there, too:
  In a competitive examination, Vinod Valloppillil and Josh Cohen of
  Microsoft Corporation write that Linux is "Trusted in mission
  criticial environments.  Linux has been deployed in mission critical,
  commercial environments with an excellent pool of public
  testimonials."  They also state that Linux "is trusted in mission
  critical applications, and - due to it's open source code - has a long
  term credibility which exceeds many other competitive OS's."

(ESR -- make sure the Halloween page has a hit counter :-)
If the Microsoft report is referred to by URL, and we have suits/press
reading this press release, it might be better to point to the report
_without_ ESR's annotations, or to a punchy article about the report
which has a link to ESR's page.

Good, isn't it?
