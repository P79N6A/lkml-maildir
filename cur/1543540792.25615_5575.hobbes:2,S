I haven't checked this, but I bet there are a few drivers that I've
written that are a lot worse in this respect. I hope that this isn't a
real problem for anyone? Don't use modules if it bothers you, or load
the modules at boot, and make sure they don't unload. 
Also the NCR53C8XX driver probably hangs the machine for 2 full
seconds during startup.
