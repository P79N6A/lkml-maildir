The relevant paragraph of the C99 standard is:
An object shall have its stored value accessed only by an lvalue
expression that has one of the following types:
-- a type compatible with the effective type of the object,
-- a qualified version of a type compatible with the effective type of
   the object,
-- a type that is the signed or unsigned type corresponding to the
   effective type of the object,
-- a type that is the signed or unsigned type corresponding to a
   qualified version of the effective type of the object,
-- an aggregate or union type that includes one of the aforementioned
   types among its members (including, recursively, a member of a
   subaggregate or contained union), or
-- a character type.
I can't really spot any lvalue here that might violate this rule.  It
would be nice if somebody could report a bug with a testcase.
