Good day.
I have a ~/bin/installkernel which installs the kernel when I as user do a 
make install at the end of compilation but 2.6.25-rc2 seems to break this:
rene@7ixe4:~/src/linux/local$ make V=1 install
make -f scripts/Makefile.build obj=arch/x86/vdso vdso_install
mkdir: cannot create directory `/lib/modules/2.6.25-rc2': Permission denied
How to fix?
Rene.
