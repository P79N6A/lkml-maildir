What I've seen happen quite frequently...
developer a: "Hey, here's a patch to do aaaa"
maintainer: "Ah, I've already sent Linus a patch to merge changes from
developer b in this area, but your changes look ok. can you resync when
Linus puts next patch out, and send me the rediffed copy again?"
developer: "Sure, no problem".
Alternatively its maintainer telling developer a "Ah, I've a bunch of
stuff queued from developer b, you guys need to talk on this and work
out how to get this stuff working together, get back to me when you've
work it out".
People management rather than source management systems.
Dave.
