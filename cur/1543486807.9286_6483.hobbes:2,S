Appended is a patch which prevents the blocksize of ramdisks from being
changed with set_blocksize(). As the function is void and does not return
any error code, which could be checked, I added a check to fat_read_super().
Now, if I want to mount a FAT fs with blocksize==512, it fails:
Feb 22 12:51:17 kg1 kernel: Changing blocksize (dev 01:00) from 1024 to 512 not possible
Feb 22 12:51:17 kg1 kernel: fat_read_super: set_blocksize (dev 01:00) failed
The patch is not very nice, as
* it teaches buffer.c, that a ramdisk is not blocksize settable, while this
  info should be contained in rd.c. However, there's no way to tell the
  buffer code.
* it would be better not to have the check for failure of set_blocksize() by
  accessing blksize_size[][], but by checking the return code of
  set_blocksize().
  
However, the patch is the one with minimal changes and thus the right one
for 2.2.2, IMHO.
Maybe, Stephen will create a better one?
Patch appended.
