%gs on x86-64 actually points to a per-CPU area; as does the proposed
%tr hack.  IMNSHO I think this is a much better idea than having
something that points to "current"; if we do this consistently across
architectures I'm sure there is plenty we can use this per-CPU area
for.
Saving and restoring %gs (or %fs, which is less likely to be used in
userspace, and therefore potentially faster) is probably not
justifiable unless we do at least four accesses to "current" in the
average system call.
