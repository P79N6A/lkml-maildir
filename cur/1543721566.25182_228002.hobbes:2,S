Right, typo.

That won't work, because we must be sure to require ",%sp" when addaw is
matched since we don't want to match, say, "addaw #-1024,%a0".  We know
that this is the whole line to be matched.

We know exactly the format of the output produced by objdump.  So even
though the regex is able to match some random junk we know that objdump
would never produce that.
