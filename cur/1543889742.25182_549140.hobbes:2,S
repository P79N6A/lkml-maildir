You have to rebuild the initrd to match the kernel and its modules.
As the kernel develops the initrd scripts need to change to match changes
in modules required to support the disks for the new kernel.
I've no experience with 2.6.11 to 2.6.14. We now use 2.6.21
and know a bit about how to support it on FC4.
What we did to find differences was to run later versions of Fedora Core
that support the kernel we want to use out of the box. Then we break open
the initrd and see what the differences are between the old and new initrd
files.
