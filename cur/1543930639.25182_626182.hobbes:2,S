Such paranoia.  Yes, the patch was compiled.   Yes, the warning was 
slipped through.  No, it is not substantive, and in fact was removed 
from another branch of our tree already.
Ignoring the rhetoric, apparently you missed the line:
+       if (q && q->metric && !bio->bi_queue) {
The prevents any reference ti bi_bdev after the intial call to 
generic_make_request.  Thanks to Evgeniy for pointing out the need for 
this measure on the last go round.
"So broken" is a gross exaggeration.  Substantive comments welcome.
