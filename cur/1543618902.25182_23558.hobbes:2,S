In the general case you want to claim resources when the hardware is using 
them. For most things that means at module load time. However many ISA
devices you can avoid the IRQ and DMA channels unless the device is active.
By deferring that you can allow people to use one or other of two clashing
devices in awkward cases.
For PCI devices the problem really doesn't arise since the resource allocations
are done for you when you use pci_enable_device, or by the pci hot plug layer
and/or BIOS as appropriate
