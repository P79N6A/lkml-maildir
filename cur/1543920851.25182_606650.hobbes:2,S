Yes, that sounds sane.
Although I also wonder whether we want one global per-arch 
ARCH_HAS_SG_CHAIN, or perhaps have something more dynamic, which allows a 
per-SG-list choice (which in turn would require some kind of "head" entry 
that is passed into sg_next(), and in general descibes the SG list)
