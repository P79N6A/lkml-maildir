Subject: AIC79xx fails built into kernel, but works as a module

Hello,
I have a 2.6.13 kernel and if the aic79xx driver is built into
the kernel it gives odd scsi errors (similar to what you would
get with a bad cable).     With the same thing build as a module
all appears to be fine, and the disk appears to function correctly.
Is this a known behavior?   The kernel has very few things build
it, the only one that could be an issue is a Sata Sil driver to
support a SIL 3114 chip with disks on it.
I am going to do some more testing on it to verify exactly what
I see.
                             Roger
