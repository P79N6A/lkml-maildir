Andries,
Yes, what's wrong with your page is that it has inappropriate 
editorial content that furthermore is phrased in an inflamatory and 
denigrating manner.
Facts are required. Warnings about potential problems (bugs, 
portability concerns, undesirable interactions with other related 
facilities, etc.) are desirable. Derogation is inappropriate and 
unwelcome.
I think that's the bulk of what is considered objectionable with the 
man page. Obviously, debate on the suitability of that vfork call is 
a separate issue and, as was mentioned in this thread, has been 
debated already. The call is there. It has the behavior it has. If 
you want to re-open that debate, it shouldn't be done in the guise of 
an attempt to document the call in question.
