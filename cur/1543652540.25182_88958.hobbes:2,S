No clue as of yet.  I do not see this information during a normal
reboot.

I used the linux-2.5.44.x86kexec-hwfixes.diff (it applied cleanly to
pure 2.5.47 + kexec); I'll try your updated version soon if there are
any major differences.

On this same system, I reconfigured and tried this:
    # CONFIG_SMP is not set
    CONFIG_X86_GOOD_APIC=y
    # CONFIG_X86_UP_APIC is not set
    # CONFIG_X86_LOCAL_APIC is not set
    # CONFIG_X86_IO_APIC is not set
None of the "ordinary" APIC initialization messages were output during
the regular BIOS->LILO boot of this kernel.
Using kexec on this kernel to run kexec_test-1.5 stops in the same way:
    # ./kexec-1.5 --debug ./kexec_test-1.5
    Shutting down devices
    Debug: sleeping function called from illegal context at
    include/asm/semaphore.h9Call Trace: [<c0113f7c>]  [<c01ec123>] 
    [<c0120af2>]  [<c0130d5d>]  [<c0130d5d> Starting new kernel
    kexec_test 1.5 starting...
    eax: 0E1FB007 ebx: 00001078 ecx: 00000000 edx: 00000000
    esi: 00000000 edi: 00000000 esp: 00000000 ebp: 00000000
    idt: 00000000 C0000000
    gdt: 00000000 C0000000
    Switching descriptors.
    Descriptors changed.
    Legacy pic setup.
    In real mode.
    <hang>
So, does this information suggest looking somewhere other than APIC
shutdown?
