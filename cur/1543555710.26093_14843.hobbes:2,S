You can now use IBM's DProbes with Opersys' Linux Trace Toolkit to provide
a universal (dynamic) tracing capability for Linux.
It is universal because it provides a common tracing mechanism for all
executables whether in user or kernel space. It is dynamic because
tracepoints are defined and applied dynamically to object modules as
probepoints using DProbes - no source code modification is required.
To use dyamic trace you will require version 1.2 of DProbes, or later from
http://oss.software.ibm.com/
and LTT version 0.9.4pre4 or later from 
http://www.opersys.com/
The DProbes kernel patch will need to be compiled with correct
configuration options to enable it to work with LTT. See the respective
installation instructions in each package for more details.
