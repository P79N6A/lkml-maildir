Hi
Is there any way to give the console a kick in the pants?
My framebuffer (and therefore system console, by definition) come up
rather late.
It seems the console doesnt care to check for drivers comming up after a
certain time, and thus I get no output despite the driver working.
I'd like to do something like console_rescan_my_damn_device() if
possible :-)
My only option right now appears to be to set up a dummy framebuffer
prior to real one starting up.
TIA.
