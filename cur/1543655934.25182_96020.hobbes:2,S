I've checked the gcc CVS. But it seems to use i486 pluse MMX and 3DNOW
instructions.
* config.gcc: Treat winchip_c6-*|winchip2-*|c3-* as pentium-mmx.
* config/i386/i386.c (processor_alias_table): Add winchip-c6, winchip2 and
c3.
* doc/invoke.texi: Mention new aliases.
**  {"c3", PROCESSOR_I486, PTA_MMX | PTA_3DNOW},   **
Is there any plan to optimize for C3 CPU in future gcc released version?
BR,
  Joseph
