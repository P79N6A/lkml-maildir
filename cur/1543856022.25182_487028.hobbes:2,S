Can we get short Documentation/ patch?

And here.

80 colums would be nice.

Should this be configurable by module parameter? Why not tell each
unload what to do?
Is /sys interface right thing to do?

} and else on same line...

Can we consolidate the strings somehow?

Oh and do not mention hdaps, there are more different accelerometer
types.

Should we have kernel doing auto-unfreeze? Perhaps we can just mlock()
the daemon?
