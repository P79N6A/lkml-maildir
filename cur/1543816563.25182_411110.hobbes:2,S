Yes, but the old version has a bug too.  I don't have 2.6.16-mm1, but
in 2.6.16 it's in arch/i386/kernel/timers/timer_tsc.c and
arch/x86_64/lib/delay.c:
static void delay_tsc(unsigned long loops)
{
        unsigned long bclock, now;
        rdtscl(bclock);
        do
        {
                rep_nop();
                rdtscl(now);
        } while ((now-bclock) < loops);
}
If (loops == 100000) and (bclock == 2^32-1) the loop will terminate
immediately when the low part of the TSC overflows because (now-bclock)
is a large number. That can't be right...
I'm running a system with this applied now.  I think there are still
problems if someone uses huge delays, though.  What keeps someone from
trying to delay for > 2^31 cycles?
i386 delay_tsc() will truncate delays when the TSC is within 'loops'
of overflow.  We must be able to handle TSC overflow both before and
after 'end', i.e. [1], [2] and [3] below.
                                               zero
                                                 |
case A (end < start)       start  [1]            |  [2]  end  [3]
                                                 |
case B (end > start)       start  [1]  end  [2]  |  [3]
