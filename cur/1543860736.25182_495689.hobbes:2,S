I find [2] most compelling, and I can confirm that I do have the same problem 
with or without optimisation for size. I don't use selinux nor has it ever 
been enabled.
At any rate, I have absolute confirmation that it is GCC 4.1.1, because with 
GCC 3.4.6 the same kernel I reported booting three days ago is still 
cheerfully working. I regularly get uptimes of 60+ days on that machine, 
rebooting only for kernel upgrades. 2.6.19 seems to be no worse in this 
regard.
Perhaps fortunately, the configs I've tried have consistently failed to shake 
the crash, so I have a semi-reproducible test case here on C3-2 hardware if 
somebody wants to investigate the problem (though it still takes 6-12 hours).
