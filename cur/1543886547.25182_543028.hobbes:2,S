Yes, Xen needs a page-sized PGD.  There are two reasons:
   1. Xen inherently needs a whole page for the pgd, because it
      classifies pages by type, and the pgd is a pagetable-typed page.
   2. When the kernel mappings are not being shared between processes,
      as in non-PAE or PAE with !SHARED_KERNEL_PMD, it maintains a
      pgd_list linked though the index field in the page structure's
      index field.  For this to work, you can't have more than one pgd
      per page.  The pgd_list is needed to sync the vmalloc mappings
      across all the pagetables.
Xen needs to set !SHARED_KERNEL_PMD for PAE when running a 32-bit kernel
under a 32-bit hypervisor; when running under a 64-bit hypervisor,
there's no need to steal any guest address space for the hypervisor.  (I
haven't implemented this on the Linux side yet.)
