Well, what I was referring to is:
static struct foo *some_ptr;
/* Assumes that $SOME_LOCK is held */
int initialize_foo_module()
{
	if (!some_ptr) {
		some_ptr = kmalloc(sizeof(*some_ptr));
		if (!some_ptr)
			return -ENOMEM;
		/* ... */
	}
	/* ... */
}
We initialize all of the static data to all-bits-clear zeros during  
kernel init.  Any platform on which the binary representations of  
"(unsigned long)0" and "(void *)0" are different (even in length, due  
to other issues) will not run the Linux kernel as it stands today.
And as to the sizeof(unsigned long) == sizeof(void *) issue, please  
remember that every Linux compiler is either ILP32 (int, long, and  
pointer are 32-bit) or LP64 (int is 32-bit and long/pointer are 64- 
bit).  We sort of fundamentally rely on these properties in code all  
over the place.
So yes the Linux kernel "breaks the standard" in a bunch of places,  
but on the other hand we're not your average software and we don't  
have to worry about building on an LLP64 compiler (Windows 64-bit and  
some UNIXes) or other strangeness.
Cheers,
Kyle Moffett
