Actually, it does not protect much anymore.  Here's a cleanup+comments
patch (against current mainline).
The non atomic stats on the cachep structure now needs serialization though,
would a spinlock be better there instead of changing them over to atomic_t s
? I wonder...

Looks like l3 list locking (which is already done) is sufficient, although
one of the two paths calling __cache_shrink takes the cpu hotplug lock
(kmem_cache_destroy()).  The other does not seem to be used much
(kmem_cache_shrink())
Thanks,
Kiran
Remove cachep->spinlock.  Locking has moved to the kmem_list3 and
most of the structures protected earlier by cachep->spinlock is
now protected by the l3->list_lock.  slab cache tunables like
batchcount are accessed always with the cache_chain_mutex held.
Patch tested on SMP and NUMA kernels with dbench processes
running, constant onlining/offlining, and constant cache tuning,
all at the same time.
