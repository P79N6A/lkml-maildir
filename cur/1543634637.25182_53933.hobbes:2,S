	Thanks.  That is a cleaner workaround.

	That just makes the behavior of make less predictable.
Whatever make does with the file names internally is its own business.
Rewriting the file names passed to commands unnecessarily is
potentially a big problem.  Suppose, for example, that this was a
command that wanted to chop up the directory prefix and that the
bottom level directory was a symbolic link (for example, maybe I have
/usr/netscape/bin as a symlink to /usr/local/bin, but I want the
installation command to record the path name as /usr/netscape/bin).

	Sorry, I do not understand what you mean.  If you want to
explain it to me, you may have to write the rule out.
	Thanks for the better workaround and the advice.
