The BPB is stored in the MBR by fdisk.  The MBR also contains CHS sector 
addresses for the location of the partitions on the disk.  fdisk 
computes those addresses by translating the LBA into CHS using a 
geometry.  If the bios is using a different geometry then those CHS 
addresses that the boot loader will request the bios to load will have a 
completely different meaning, so the loader won't get the intended sector.

Yes, I've been saying it is a translation key the whole time.  The bios 
uses it to figure out what sector you are referencing in int 13, and 
fdisk uses it to figure out what CHS values correspond to a given LBA so 
it can store them in the MBR.  If they don't both use the same 
translation key, they aren't both speaking the same language, and so the 
boot loader will break.

And fdisk must also perform the encode so the partition table can 
correctly indicate where the partition begins.  The boot loader passes 
those values to the bios which decodes them.  The encode and decode must 
both be done using the same key.

We aren't talking about dos's filesystem here, we're talking about the 
windows ( or dos ) boot loader which directly uses int 13 and passes the 
CHS values from the MBR.  The meaning of those values is entirely 
dependent on the geometry, so when fdisk writes those values to the MBR 
it has to be using the same geometry that the bios will use to decode 
it, otherwise when the sector address of the partition is encoded using 
one geometry, and decoded using another, it will come out all wrong.

The boot loader is directly using the bios.
