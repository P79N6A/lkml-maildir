Also, there are changes in Greg's i2c tree which break your new driver:
drivers/i2c/chips/ds1337.c:60: initializer element is not constant
drivers/i2c/chips/ds1337.c:60: (near initialization for `ds1337_driver.id')
drivers/i2c/chips/ds1337.c: In function `ds1337_get_datetime':
drivers/i2c/chips/ds1337.c:155: structure has no member named `id'
drivers/i2c/chips/ds1337.c: In function `ds1337_set_datetime':
drivers/i2c/chips/ds1337.c:206: structure has no member named `id'
drivers/i2c/chips/ds1337.c: In function `ds1337_detect':
drivers/i2c/chips/ds1337.c:333: structure has no member named `id'
drivers/i2c/chips/ds1337.c:343: structure has no member named `id'
