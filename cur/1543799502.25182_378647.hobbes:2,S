I emailed Areca and got a response that indicated they didn't know about
the remaining stylistic and API-usage issues with the driver.
If someone could spell it out to them what exactly needs to to be fixed

work.
The current driver does indeed work. Last night I copied several hundred
gigabytes of data using the driver.
