Hi all,
Sorry for the confusion :)
I saw an email from an Intel guy here on this list a couple of weeks
ago if I recall correctly regarding the Interl drivers for this
specific card, with a URL, thats why I assumed this was the place to
look for.
I didnt even know that 2.6.21-rc1/2 had in-tree drivers for this
network card, which config option is that?
Oh and like always, thanks for your help :)
Patrick
