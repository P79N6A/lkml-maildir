Having resource size configurable is nice but it brings added complexity
with it. The question would be if code bloat is significant enough to 
go for other option. Last time I had posted few compilation results on
i386. I am summarizing these again.
allmodconfig (CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO=n)
-----------
vmlinux bloat:4096 bytes
allyesconfig  (CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO=n)
-----------
                                                                                
vmlinux size bloat: 52K
So even with allyesconfig total bloat is 52K and I am assuming the
systems where memory is at premium are going to use a very limited set
of modules and effectively will see much lesser code bloat than 52K.
For Kconfigurable resource size, probably dma_addr_t is not the very 
appropriate as at lots of places size also needs to be 64 bit and 
using dma_addr_t is not good. This will then boil down to introducing
a new type like dma_addr_t whose size is Kconfigurable.
Even if it is done, it will not get rid of code bloat completely as lots
of code bloat comes from printk() statemets where we explicitly typecast
the resource to (unsigned long long) to avoid compilation warnings across
the platforms. This typecasting will continue to be there even with
Kconfigurable resources.
Personally I would tend to think that we can live with this code bloat.
Thanks
Vivek
