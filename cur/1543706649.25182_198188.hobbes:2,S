Subject: [PATCH] calculating interpreter's credentials - binfmt_misc 2.6.3-rc1-mm1
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This patch allows for misc binaries to run with credentials and security
token that are calculated according to the binaries, and not according
to
the interpreter, which is the legacy behavior of binfmt_misc. The way it
is done is by calling prepare_binprm, which is where these attributes
are
calculated, before switching the 'file' field in the bprm from the
binary
to the interpreter. This feature should be used with care, since the 
interpreter will have root permissions when running a setuid binary
owned
by root. Please note - 
*) Only root can register an interpreter with binfmt_misc
*) The feature is documented and the administrator is advised to handle
it
   with care
*) The new feature is enabled only with a special flag in the
registration
   string. When this flag is not specified the current behavior of
binfmt_misc
   is kept
*) The use of this feature implies the use of the 'open-binary' feature
   (see '[PATCH]: non-readable binaries - binfmt_misc 2.6.0' from Jan.
15),
   so that the binary cannot be replaced 'underneath the feet' of the 
   interpreter
*) This is the only 'right' way for an interpreter to know the correct
   AT_SECURE value for the interpreted binary
The patch is against 2.6.3-rc1-mm1 (it's also attached in case the lines
get broken) :
