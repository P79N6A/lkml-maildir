After a quick look, it seems to me that one reasonable option would
be:
  svcauth_gss_register_pseudoflavor
     returns a void* which is 'new', and possible calls try_get_module(),
     failing if that fails. and
  svcauth_gss_unregister_pseudoflavor
     takes the void* (not a name) and calls auth_domain_put on it, and
     then calls put_module().
  'struct pf_desc' would have to gain a
        void * handle;
  to hold the returned value.
Would that solve the problem as you see it?
