Subject: [PATCH 9/9] lguest: don't crash host on NMI
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

"handle" NMI by ignoring it.  Can't have been important, right?  As the
lguest64 hackers explained, handling NMI is a PITA.  Now oprofile does
not crash machine.
