ok, i had a look at your data, and i think this is the result of the 
scheduler balancing out to idle CPUs more agressively than before. Doing 
that is almost always a good idea though - but indeed it can result in 
"bad" numbers if all you do is to measure the ping-pong "performance" 
between two threads. (with no real work done by any of them).
the moment you saturate the system a bit more, the numbers should 
improve even with such a ping-pong test.
do you have testcode (or a modification of your testcase sourcecode) 
that simulates a real-life situation where 2.6.24-rc4 performs not as 
well as you'd like it to see? (or if qmt.tar.gz already contains that 
then please point me towards that portion of the test and how i should 
run it - thanks!)
