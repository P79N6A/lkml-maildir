Subject: X not starting... AGPGART error with 2.6.17-rc3, not with 2.6.16-1.2096_FC5

Hello,
I've installed an FC5 x86_64 on my machine, and everything is fine when
running fedora-supplied kernels : machine boots, X starts, and so on.
But, when switching to 2.6.17-rc3 (or any other official 2.6.16.x kernel),
I've got the following issue :
 - machine boots fine,
 - starting X results in the screen switching video mode (CRT, so I can 'hear'
   it), and then X starts sucking all the CPUs, and nothing comes to screen.
 - I've got the following in /var/log/messages :
May  1 19:09:38 riri kernel: agpgart: Found an AGP 3.0 compliant device at
0000:00:00.0.

I can't find why this happens... This machine was previously running FC4, 
with vanilla kernel, and it was fine... 
But as here the problem comes from changing the kernel stuff, and nothing
else, I'm encline to think it may be kernel related...
Any idea ?
Regards,
Paul
