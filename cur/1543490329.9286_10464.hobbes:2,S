This patch breaks the code. The current algorithm used is that the elevator
stops at intermediate floors when going up, but not when going down. So it
is ok to add a floor above the top one on the current trip, or below the
lowest on the next.
I have a currently working algo which is greedy instead. i.e. for a new
request, it computes the place where its insertion will produce the least
incremental cost (where cost is the number of additional sectors to seek).
It seems to work for me. No idea how to compare the two algos, though. Can 
somebody help me out here...
Another point is that IN_ORDER seems to be called only for two requests
on the same device, so no idea why it compares the device numbers.

Here's the patch (to 2.2.3):
