Because if there already exists more than a handful peoples' eyes glaze
over and ignore "just one more warning"
Unless they break the build, or if there currently are 0 and they make
it non-zero, people seem not to care....sad.  Probably the same for
sparse/checkpatch, "there's plenty already, I can't be bothered to look"
Subject to someone _making_ it an issue, can't see it changing.
