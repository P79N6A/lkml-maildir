The above code DOES fix the problem I was describing.
Your email seems to suggest the above code also fix some other problems?
If we choose the above way to fix the lost need_resched flag, we would
also
need to apply the similar fix to two other functions for the SMP version
:
	1. smp_local_timer_interrupt()
	2. update_process_times()
(I might miss one or two, but essentially all functions that a) can be
called
from interrupt context and b) need_resched flag is set to the CURRENT
process
need to be modified in a similar way.)
++++
If we were to fix *ONLY* the lost need_resched flag problem, I still
like
my fix a little better.  However, if Ingo's fix has other benefits,
we probably should take his.
