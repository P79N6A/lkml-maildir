	Testing the 2.2.0-preX kernels I found that its very
inconvenient to have only vmlinuz & vmlinuz.old. As for me better
keep several kernels to have possibilities to downgrade & compare
if needed. So I propose to make arch/i386/boot/Makefile target
zlilo as follow:
zlilo: $(CONFIGURE) $(BOOTIMAGE)
        if [ -f $(INSTALL_PATH)/vmlinuz ]; then mv $(INSTALL_PATH)/vmlinuz $(INSTALL_PATH)/vmlinuz.old; fi
        if [ -f $(INSTALL_PATH)/System.map ]; then mv $(INSTALL_PATH)/System.map $(INSTALL_PATH)/System.old; fi
        cat $(BOOTIMAGE) > $(INSTALL_PATH)/vmlinuz-$(KERNELRELEASE)
        cp $(TOPDIR)/System.map $(INSTALL_PATH)/System.map-$(KERNELRELEASE)
        ln -s $(INSTALL_PATH)/vmlinuz-$(KERNELRELEASE) $(INSTALL_PATH)/vmlinuz
        ln -s $(INSTALL_PATH)/System.map-$(KERNELRELEASE) $(INSTALL_PATH)/System.map
        if [ -x /sbin/lilo ]; then /sbin/lilo; else /etc/lilo/install; fi
This one completely compatible with original, but allow to keep old kernels
marked which is one. BTW procps utils (ps, top) looks for /boot/System.map-2.2.0-$(KERNELRELEASE)
first, and /boot/System.map as the second.
