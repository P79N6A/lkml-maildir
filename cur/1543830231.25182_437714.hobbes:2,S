Silly me, I was reading the documentation, which doesn't cover this. :)
It works:
$ pfmon --system-wide -0 -e interrupts_masked_cycles,interrupts_taken --edge-mask 0,1 -t 10
<session to end in 10 seconds>
CPU0    16359 INTERRUPTS_MASKED_CYCLES
CPU0     5006 INTERRUPTS_TAKEN
5006 hardware interrupts in 10 seconds, 16359 interrupt-disable events ==>
the kernel disabled interrupts 11353 times for critical sections.  To get
useful results it looks like booting with idle=poll and disabling cpufreq
is needed, though, since interrupts_masked_cycles (non-edge mode) counts
even when the CPU is halted:
$ pfmon --system-wide -0 -e interrupts_masked_cycles,cpu_clk_unhalted -t 10
<session to end in 10 seconds>
CPU0    352020255 INTERRUPTS_MASKED_CYCLES
CPU0     65351172 CPU_CLK_UNHALTED

That produces no output except for column headings.  Thinking it was a problem with
x86_64 32-bit support, I built a p6 version.  I tried both short and long
periods on both systems with the same result:
$ pfmon --smpl-module=inst-hist -ecpu_clk_unhalted -k --short-smpl-period=100000 --resolve-addr --system-wide -t 10
only kernel symbols are resolved in system-wide mode

And here's what it took to get everything working on Pentium II (seems OK, not
thoroughly tested:)
