Well I tried this patch and it works.  I captured a log showing the
signals and eflags again when running the program.  I compared it to
the working version.  There are differences, but none seem to be the
scenario TF was not set when it should have been.  Both log files are
just about the same size too.  I captured a second log in a row, and
compared the previous.  Again there are differences, so there is some
unavoidable randomness.
Since I cannot spot any issue, the patch looks good.  Are there any
other test cases?
