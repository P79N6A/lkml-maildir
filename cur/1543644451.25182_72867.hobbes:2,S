I'd be happy to move that work out of the RPC callbacks if you could
point out which other processes actually can do it.
The main problem is that the VFS/MM has no way of relabelling pages as
being invalid or no longer up to date: I once proposed simply clearing
PG_uptodate on those pages which cannot be cleared by
invalidate_inode_pages(), but this was not to Linus' taste.
