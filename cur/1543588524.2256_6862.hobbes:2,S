Hallo world!
I don't know, if I'm here at the right mailinglist, but I found another 
posting for this problem right here, so I decided to post this additional 
question here too.
I'm using kernel 2.4.3ac11 (or previous) and actual DRI-sources from 
dri.sourceforge.net with an ATI EXPERT2000 graphic accelerator (Rage 128). My 
motherboard has the VIA686a (VIA KX133)-chipset with an Athlon 800MHz 
processor.
The acceleration seems to be working fine so far but I often get the 
errormessage which I wrote in the subject.
Another message I often get, is the following:
[drm:r128_do_wait_for_fifo] *ERROR* r128_do_wait_for_fifo failed!
I found the posting from Anton Blanchard (subject: Re: uniteruptable sleep) 
here in this mailinglist and I checked his suggestion. I found, that the 
changes he proposed, have been already implemented in the CVS-source-code of 
DRI - but the problem still exists.
Is the problem sitting 50 cm before the screen - or is it a bug?
Thank you very much for your great work and your advice
Regards,
Andreas Hartmann
