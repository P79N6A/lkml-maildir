please see the bottom of this message for the origanal message..
I have moved this over to the kernel mailing list as well
because  if this interrupt bug is as you say it is then it may
affect non smp machines in a different way then SMP machines and
may cause problems elsewhere...

  again my system was doing fine for about a month then last
night it came back.. I had used a patch that allowed me to
change the APIC triggering from APIC-edge to APIC-level, and
things were okay for a month or so..

okay was this code between #ifdef __SMP__  or not? and how did
you track this down? if this was not between #ifdef's then
people on non SMP machines should have clock skews and interrupt
misses also..

*******************original message *************************
it came back last night, while using X my mouse suddenly went
                  bezerko again.
                  <breif history>
                  SMP machine DUAL 233 tyan tomcat IV (buggy
BIOS)
                  2.2.9 or later kernels
                  there have been problems with the APIC's on
numerous machines
                  a patch was sent out to change the behavior of
the interrupt
                  from APIC-level to APIC-edge or XT-PIC or from
anyone to another
                  (thanks Jos)... I used this patch to change
the behavior from
                  edge to level, and for a while this was
working, but last night
                  it came back. 
                  I was writing some code in nedit, and had
gnome-terminal open,
                  and runing fvwm95 as the window manager, with
kfm and xteddy..
                  </end history>
                  I'll be switiching the APIC-level to XT-PIC as
I know that will
                  work. It did with 2.0 kernels and I tried it
once before and
                  seemed to work, but if it doesn't I'll let you
all know. Also
                  level seemed to be working just fine for a
while now, probably
                  about a month
                  <Good news>
                  I was using a program I wrote (mpstat self
plug here) to log
                  some information, (cpu %, interrupts, maj/min
faults) and have
                  that log file saved with the date in the
filename <bad news>but
                  not on this machine. Although this program
does log interrupts,
                  they are not seperate, they are summed up, so
if there is a
                  sudden increase it would be difficult to tell
where it was but
                  it is possible to guess.</bad news> Also in
viewing this there
                  was no increase in interrupts that I saw, but
I only did a quick
                  glance. (If you want this email me direcly
please and I'll send
                  it tonight)
                  </good news>
                  This bug effects SMP machines (APIC bug) and
causes bezerko
                  mouse behavior, and can also cause NFS
problems (not sure what
                  thou)
                  I know that work is being done on this to fix
the bug (not sure
                  of how that is going). 
                  I have been given a temporary solution (the
patch -> change to
                  XT-PIC from APIC). but this means that all my
interrrupt for
                  that IRQ will be on the boot cpu. :-(
                  The original problem was believed to be in the
APIC-edge code.
                  But since I have been using the patch, and had
set it to
                  APIC-level this may no longer be true. The way
I see it there
                  are one of two possible problems then:
                      1) my mouse needs to be edge triggered but
then why did it
                  work for a month as lkevel triggered oh so
well?
                      2) the bug is not in the APIC-edge code,
but somewhere else
                  in the source code. 
                  This is an illusive bug, and very hard to
reproduce and occurs
                  randomly. Just thought an update was
necessary.
