Solution: Developer A does a trivial patch -R for the changes that 
generate rejects. Cleanups are NOPs and they are almost infinitely 
splittable. You can apply and unapply them chunk by chunk, almost 
always.
and we actually have first-hand experience with the effects of 
largescale cleanups:

i've never seen cleanups truly interfere with development work, in fact 
i mostly saw the positive effects of them. They are easily undone and 
easily redone. But they do keep developers honest (no lame "oh, i'll 
clean this up after i do feature X, Y and Z") and they do keep newbies 
involved. The Linux kernel does have a fundamental "we are too hostile 
towards newbies" problem. It's also fundamentally Linuxish: nobody 
really "owns" the code in an exclusive fashion. If you dont keep it 
clean, someone else will clean it up for you.
and even if there are patch conflicts, it can all be done intelligently 
and trivially. Mail us: "please do not clean up pgtable.h because i'm 
working on unifying it and will do the cleanup after that" and we dont 
clean it up.
But broad statements of "cleanups hinder development work" are just 
plain _WRONG_. Cleanups are good by default - full stop. There are 
exceptions, and we all recognize them when we see them.

what do want to imply by 'these days'?
