	Hello,
FYI, this kernel seems to work all right with the following patches :
ext3-0.0.7a (
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/sct/
)
lfs-1.1 (
http://www.moldybread.net/patch/kernel-2.2/
 without ea support)
It has been running for about 24 hours on a standard uniprocessor x86
PC workstation.  BTW, is there a timetable for the release of 2.2.21?
						Thank you,
						Cedric Ware.
