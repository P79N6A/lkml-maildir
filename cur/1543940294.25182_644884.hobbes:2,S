For the git users in the audience, that's commit 
30e748a507919a41f9eb4d10b4954f453325a37d
I just confirmed that:
A) today's -git still exhibits this bug.
B) Backing out the above irq-twiddling patch makes it stop exhibiting the bug 
for me.  (Boots to a shell prompt, it can use the network, etc.)
So that patch is definitely the trigger for the panic, and reverting the patch 
is one way to fix it.  (And probably the best way to make it work for 
2.6.24.1.)
