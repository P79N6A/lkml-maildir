http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/andrea/kernels/v2.4/2.4.20aa1/05_vm_16_active_free_zone_bhs-1
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/andrea/kernels/v2.4/2.4.20aa1/10_inode-highmem-2
The former is the most important and, alas, has dependencies on
earlier patches.
hm, OK.  I've pulled all Andrea's VM changes and the inode-highmem fix
into a standalone diff.  I'll beat on that a bit tonight before unleashing
it.

These numbers are a little odd.  You seem to have only lost 200M of
lowmem to buffer_heads.  Bill, what's your take on this?
Maybe we're looking at the wrong thing.  Are any of your applications
using mlock(), mlockall(), etc?
