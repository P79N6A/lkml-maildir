Thanks Len - you explained it to me perfectly, and as suggested:
           CPU0       CPU1       
  0:        121        494   IO-APIC-edge      timer

  8:          0          1   IO-APIC-edge      rtc0
  9:          0          0   IO-APIC-fasteoi   acpi

 16:         86      85163   IO-APIC-fasteoi   nvidia
 20:          0          4   IO-APIC-fasteoi   ehci_hcd:usb1
 21:          0          0   IO-APIC-fasteoi   sata_nv
 22:        570     404175   IO-APIC-fasteoi   sata_nv, Intel ICH
 23:       1236    8996739   IO-APIC-fasteoi   ohci_hcd:usb2, eth0
NMI:          0          0   Non-maskable interrupts

SPU:          0          0   Spurious interrupts
ERR:          1
MIS:          0
Now appears fine (I get one ERR at boot, for some reason).
Thanks for the information.
