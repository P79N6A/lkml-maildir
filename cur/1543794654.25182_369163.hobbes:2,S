Please see the explanation for the 'flags' in Documentation/spi.txt

I bet the drivers that don't need neither threads not workqueue there's 
no need in async transfers as well. :)
On the other hand, threads is a flexible mechanism for handling async 
stuff, and there won't be a lot of threads so the overhead won't be high.
You might also want to ask why you can't change the steering wheel 
placement in your car from right-side to rleft-side although you travel 
by car to continental Europe once per decade. ;-)

I'm afraid that you're not quite getting the whole concept. The concept 
is to provide thorough and stable solution.
Given that the buffer passed is declared as, say, static, the whole 
kernel might crash if we try to pass it to DMA. David's core itself is 
not capable of filtering that and letting the driver decide adds more 
complexity to the driver.
If we're choosing between adding complexity to the core and adding it to 
the particular drivers, it's definitely better to add it to the core cuz 
it's done _once_.

Can you please elaborate on that?
