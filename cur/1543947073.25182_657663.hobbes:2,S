I too agree to merge, it especially since it fixed several problems
for David. However, I would like to know first if the same problems
also happen with the 2.6 driver or if it is OK. The risk is getting
2.4 fixed and not 2.6, which could cause regressions for people upgrading
from 2.4 to 2.6. Of course, a regression on a USB-serial adapter is
not dramatic, but it's a general principle to keep in mind that 2.6
should be safe (or at least actively being fixed) when merging driver
changes in 2.4.
Thanks,
Willy
