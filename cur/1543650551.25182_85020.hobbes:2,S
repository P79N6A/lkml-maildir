Typically the way you deal with not having a usably cheap
nanosecond-resolution clock is that you use the best available clock
(say if HZ=1000 you'll increment by 1000000 each timer tick), and then
simply use an atomic counter for the smaller divisions.  This makes
the relation "is A newer than B" correct, while avoiding the overhead
of producing exact timestamps below the available resolution.
