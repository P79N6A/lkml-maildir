Only ramdisk and shmem have been returning AOP_WRITEPAGE_ACTIVATE.
Both of those set BDI_CAP_NO_WRITEBACK.  ramdisk never returned it
if !wbc->for_reclaim.  I contend that shmem shouldn't either: it's
a special code to get the LRU rotation right, not useful elsewhere.
Though Documentation/filesystems/vfs.txt does imply wider use.
I think this is where people use the phrase "go figure" ;)
