Umm... It might be, but
	* it makes fixing races in fs/super.c easier and we will need that
in 2.4 (or, at least, backported to 2.4 at some point)
	* it's backwards-compatible.
	* it allows to kill tons of the ugliness in rd.c in obviously
correct way, for values of obviously correct equal to "provably equivalent
behaviour to the old code"
I think that it's OK for 2.4, but then I'm obviously biased (mostly by
the fact that I know how much it allows to clean up without breaking any
compatibility, including binary compatibility in the kernel). Up to you,
indeed.

Well, since all I actually use in the full variant of patch is sys_mknod(),
sys_chdir() and sys_mkdir()... IMO tmpfs is an overkill here. Maybe we
really need minimal rootfs in the kernel (no regular files) and let
ramfs, tmpfs, whatever-device-fs use it as a library.
