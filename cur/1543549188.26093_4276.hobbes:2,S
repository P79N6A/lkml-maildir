Hi
I am working on booting linux from diskonchip2000 provided by M-systems.
I am using the kernel version 2.2.14-12 and TFFS4.2
I am following Aug installation manual.
I have successfully made DOC as additional chip and created a personal
filesystem from doc.
When i am trying to make run doc-lilo command i get the error doc.b not
found though it is there in the path.
please help me out.
cc the comments/result to mail id.
Thanx
Srilakshmi
