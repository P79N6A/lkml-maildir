ok. Would be nice to check whether reverting that single change solves 
the boot problem. If it does i'll switch the measurement method to be 
do_gettimeoffset based, that way the measurement will still be accurate.  
(which is needed for precise migration cost results) Right now the 
calibration uses sched_clock() - which was the reason for the change.
(btw., if the TSC is that unreliable on numaq boxes, shouldnt we disable 
it for userspace apps too? Or are those hangs purely kernel bugs? In 
which case it might make sense to debug those a bit more - large-scale 
TSC unsyncedness is something that could slip in on other hardware too.)
