Note that it may not be the "cli" itself - the "iret" may be slower if it
has to enable interrupts that were disabled before. Ie the iret microcode
may have the equivalent of
	/* Did eflags change? */
	if ((new_eflags ^ old_eflags) & IF_MASK)
		.. do sti/cli as appropriate ..
which would mean that the "cli" itself may take 4 cycles, but the "sti"
implicit in the iret will _also_ take 4 cycles and is optimized away when
not needed.
Which would add up to the 8 cycles needed for a ~3.4% speedup (this is
assuming the baseline is something like 250 cycles per system call, I've
not checked that assumption).
