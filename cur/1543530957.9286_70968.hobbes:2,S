Hi,
I recently upgraded my hobby Alpha system after several months and
noticed that Squid stopped working with a StatHistBin error as
mentioned in the Squid FAQ:
> assertion failed: StatHist.c:91: `statHistBin(H, max) == H->capacity -
> 1' on Alpha system.

Does this sound right? Is anyone aware of a possible fix (changing to
an older GCC or libc6 for example?)
Thanks,
Jamie
