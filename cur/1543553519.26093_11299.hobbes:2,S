I contend that the barrier to entry is already quite low, as proven by
the fact that *I* contribute to kernel development, albeit rather

Run the following command in the Linux source directory:
  grep '^[LW]:' MAINTAINERS | sort -u | more
Then come back with your hot new ideas about having different mailing
