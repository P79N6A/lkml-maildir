It is not generally possible to automatically detect the IRQ of a parallel
port like that (only SPP) without upsetting attached devices. (If no
devices are attached, you just _can't_ figure out the IRQ.)
Does your BIOS have a setting for the parallel port mode?  You might want
to try playing with that if so.
