Sorry for my typo. I actually means "0-1G physical memory space." My
question is actually why there is a 3G offset from linear kernel to
physical kernel. Why not simply have kernel memory linear space
located on 0-1G linear address, and therefore the physical kernel and
linear kernel just coincide?
Or perhaps this offset is just some personal favor. Say if the first
kernel designer decided to locate kernel at 2-3G linear address, then
2G offset would have appeared in code. Is this the case?
