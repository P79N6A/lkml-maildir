Hi!

Well, you admit it may be useful in future, still you do big
search&replace to remove it... I do not think we want that.
(Maybe removing D3cold is useful, but even if it is, please don't
rename D3hot).

No, but we want something to return when error happens in
pci_choose_state.

So how do you handle bootup?
