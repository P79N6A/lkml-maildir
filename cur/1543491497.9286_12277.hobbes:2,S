	The default limit is 1024 fh.  ulimit -n will reset this.  *note*,
a normal user CANNOT increase their own fh limit.
After
echo 32768 > /proc/sys/fs/file-max   # increase default system wide from 4096
echo 131072 > /proc/sys/fs/inode-max # boost system wide inodes too
ulimit -n 32768 #change roots fh limit
I get 32285 opened...
Whatever script calls your program should increase the default fh limit
before it starts the program as a normal user.
