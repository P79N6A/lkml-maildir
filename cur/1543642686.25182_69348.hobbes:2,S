Very likely -- unless you use the UNIFIED_PATCH test.
5/10 ->
X-Spam-Status: No, hits=-1.4 required=5.0
        tests=NO_REAL_NAME,PORN_10,UNIFIED_PATCH,MSG_ID_ADDED_BY_MTA_2,
              DATE_IN_PAST_96_XX
        version=2.31
... as basically it's just the fact that the mail contains a patch that
reverts the spam label here.
