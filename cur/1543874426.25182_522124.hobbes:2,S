Unfortunately not, nonlinear vmas don't have a linear relation between
address and offset. What you would need to do is do a linear walk of the
page tables. But even that might not suffice if nonlinear vmas may form
a non-injective, surjective mapping.
/me checks..
Hmm, yes that seems valid, so in general, this reverse mapping does not
uniquely exist for non-linear vmas. :-(
What to do... disallow futexes in nonlinear mappings, store the address
in the key?

the vma_prio_tree would be able to give all vmas associated with a
mapping.
