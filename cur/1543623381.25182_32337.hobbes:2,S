Ah, that makes sense.  Please don't apply this patch then.
The reason I'm looking at this code is because I now have access to a
i386 box that needs an increased value for MAX_MP_BUSSES to boot
properly.  This is because of the PCI hotplug functionality that this
box has for it's extra PCI busses.
I'm trying to update James Cleverdon's patch that dynamically determined
the proper value for MAX_MP_BUSSES at init to the latest kernel, but
I'll stick with 2.4 for now until you get the NUMA PCI patch into 2.5.
thanks,
