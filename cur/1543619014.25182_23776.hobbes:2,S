Jesper,
     Let's use sd_find_queue() as an example.
     If the array pointed by rscsi_disk has been allocated,
dpnt cannot be null.
     If rscsi_disk has not been allocated, dpnt = &rscsi_disks[target]
may not be null depending on the value of target. Thus, "if (!dpnt)"
is not sufficient anyway.
     You can also look at sd_attach(), in which "if (!dpnt->device)" is
tested, not "if (!dpnt)".
Regards,
Peter

Maybe I don't understand this right, but shouldn't that be
if (!dpnt || !dpnt->device)
        return NULL;    /* No such device */
?
