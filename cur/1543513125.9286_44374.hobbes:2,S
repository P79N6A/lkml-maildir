Author : Xie Hua Gang.
lids is an intrusion detect system patch for Linux kernel.
This patch (Version 0.1) is for the Linux kernel 2.2.12.
This is the first release of the software.
It can protect the important file from being changed. Any one include
Root
can not change the protected files or diretory and its sub-diretory .
It also provides two states ( a switch ) in kernel.
        1 . security mode ( default ). This mode is the protect mode .
        2 . normal mode ,This mode is the normal mode . one can modify
the
            file like using former linux kernel.
In contrast to the current File IDS system. such as the Tripwire ,FCheck
,etc.
 It has little system load , even can be ignore.
