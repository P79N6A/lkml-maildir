The real problem here is neither Intel nor users. It's crappy vendor
QA.  I recently had to deal with a batch of e1000 cards that had the
*wrong* EEPROMs, with *correct* checksums.
So of course the driver didn't complain - nevermind the fact that the
EEPROMs might claim you have a copper card when it's really fiber. And
that's best case, because it fails obviously. Far worse is when an
EEPROM is close enough to "work", but claim the wrong chipset revision
and cause the driver to do totally wrong things in strange
circumstances.
I think this is what Auke is worried about. If you can't trust the
EEPROM, all sorts of maddeningly subtle things can go wrong. And it
isn't likely to be properly diagnosed by an end user.
The sad thing is that the checksum can only protect against a subset of
EEPROM problems. But it does help. As a counterexample, a power failure
last weekend corrupted the EEPROM of the onboard e100 in one of my
servers, and this EEPROM check led to an immediate diagnosis of the
problem.

There is already support for EEPROM read/write in ethtool. I used it to
fix the e1000 cards in question. If e100 implements ethtool -E, all
that's needed is documentation on where in the EEPROM the checksum is
stored and how to calculate it. I don't doubt the freely-available pdfs
for e100 chipsets cover this.
