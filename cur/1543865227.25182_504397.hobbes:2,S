This is not the case on a read error - we commonly see transient errors 
on reads from disks.  What we push our vendors to do is to try to keep 
the "worst case" response down to tens of seconds as they retry, etc 
internally with a device. When they take that long (and they do), adding 
retries up the stack can translate into minutes per sector.
The interesting point of this question is about the typically pattern of 
IO errors. On a read, it is safe to assume that you will have issues 
with some bounded numbers of adjacent sectors.

This is really a tricky one - what can happen when we fail merged IO 
requests is really unpredictable behavior up at the application level 
since the IO error might not be at all relevant to my part of the 
request.  Merging can produce a request that is much larger than any 
normal drive error.
I really like the idea of being able to set this kind of policy on a per 
drive instance since what you want here will change depending on what 
your system requirements are, what the system is trying to do (i.e., 
when trying to recover a failing but not dead yet disk, IO errors should 
be as quick as possible and we should choose an IO scheduler that does 
not combine IO's).
