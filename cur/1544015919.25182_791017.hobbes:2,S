Like anything that spawns a thread or process per request/client, or
preallocates set of them which connect to the huge object like database.
Most of the time database/server is killed first instead of comparably
small clients. In some cases it is possible to tune the environment, in
others it is not that simple. This patch works for such situatons
perfectly and does not require additional administrative burden, since
it does not make thinge worse as a whole, but only better for the very
commonly used cases, that's why I propose it for inclusion.
