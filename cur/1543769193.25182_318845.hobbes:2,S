Thanks for your reply.  I have proceeded according to this "Dmix Howto",
however it doesn't work. I have proceeded successfully up to the command
"aoss mpg123 some.mp3". When I run this, mp3 is played very fast, in
about 1-2 seconds (normal pitch, but skipping very fast forward).
mpg123 Version 0.59s-r9 (2000/Oct/27)
aoss doesn't have --version option
alsaplayer 0.99.76
The document doesn't contain any contact where to send bugreports that
the course described actually doesn't work.
Any other idea how to make Skype & XMMS run at the same time on Linux?
