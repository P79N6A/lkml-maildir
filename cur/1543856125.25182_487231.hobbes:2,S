Good question -- I don't know either.

Here is what happens: sector 0 is broken -- the device cannot read
the media at that location.  The device properly returns a certain
type of uncorrectable MEDIUM ERROR (ASC: UNRECOVERABLE READ ERR).
SCSI Core loops around its retries (which this patch fixes) and
eventually gives up and sends it for "completion".  This is what
happens when scsi_check_sense() returns NEEDS_RETRY to
scsi_decide_disposition() to scsi_softirq().  The first chunk
of the patch fixes this.
We end up in scsi_io_completion(), where good_bytes = 0, and
result = 0x08000002 (DRIVER SENSE and CHECK CONDITION).
This statement in scsi_io_completion() causes the infinite retry loop:
   if (scsi_end_request(cmd, 1, good_bytes, !!result) == NULL)
         return;
substitute to get: scsi_end_request(cmd, uptodate=1, uptodate bytes=0, retry=1)
Yeah, but it doesn't make sense to call scsi_end_request() with uptodate=1 and
uptodate bytes = 0.  This causes the infinite retry, since the code
tries to re-read the whole xfer size (0 bytes were uptodate and retry=1),
from the bad media.
That is, we want to set uptodate=1 iff there was at least 1 byte up to date.
Else if nothing was read, uptodate bytes = 0, then we should pass
uptodate = 0, uptodate_bytes = total xfer, to mean the whole xfer is
not uptodate; and retry iff there was no error. (This is the very bottom
of the function.)
... I know, I know, but that's what we've got.
See this commit 03aba2f79594ca94d159c8bab454de9bcc385b76 as well.
