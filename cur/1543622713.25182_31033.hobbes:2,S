   Do you want a dump of the vpd_data it receives?
It isn't interesting, so no.
   Here's the dmesg line after
   the driver is loaded:
Thank you.
   The machine is a Dell PowerEdge 2550 machine, running RedHat Linux 7.2 (with
   2.4.18 kernel).  Let me know if you want me to run any specific tests, it's
   connected to a Cisco switch with gigabit-ports (so I can actually test
   things like jumboframes if needed).
At this point I'm mostly interested in if it works at all :-)
If the answer is yes, tell me that and then you can feel
free to experiment with jumbo frames et al. to discover
other bugs in the driver :-)
