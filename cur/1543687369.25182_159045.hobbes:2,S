I have been asking for a similar thing as well, David mentioned some
things that would break, but I believe they break if you use source
routing, so that seems not to be a real objection.

Unless all your customers do odd things with networking, or you are not
using source routing for some reason, you don't do customers a favor by
giving that advice. Most users have one NIC with one IP and Linux works.
The Linux implementation is not broken by standard, it's just that there
were two ways to do it, and the one chosen is allowed by frequently
non-functional.
I find it interesting that we can't change networking because a few
complex systems would have to be reconfigured, but we *can* change modules
which requires config changes on probably 90% of all systems (commercial
distributions). Linus has rethought some of his design decisions, but
David seems intent on not only keeping this one, but preventing the
addition of a flag which would solve the problem for most people.
