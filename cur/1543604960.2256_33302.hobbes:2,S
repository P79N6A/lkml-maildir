This does not make any sense. There is no concept of a Toshiba
specific IDE controller. For example my laptop a Tecra 780DVD
from lspci I get
00:05.1 IDE interface: Intel Corporation 82371AB PIIX4 IDE (rev 01)
Typically all the laptops supported by the Toshiba SMM mode driver
are all Intel based controllers, or if the laptop is really old are
generic basic IDE controllers.
The laptops not supported by the Toshiba SMM mode driver are all
Texas Instruments chipset IDE controllers as far as I am aware.
What makes you suspect that there is such a thing as a Toshiba
IDE controller?
JAB.
