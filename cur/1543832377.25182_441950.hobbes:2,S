FWIW, the vintage scx200_gpio driver manipulates the LED just fine.
# cat /etc/modprobe.d/gpio
# assign last 2 dynamic devnums to gpio (255..240)
options scx200_gpio major=240
options pc8736x_gpio major=241
soekris:~# ll /dev/led
crw-r--r-- 1 root root 240, 20 Jun 24  2005 /dev/led
echo 1 > /dev/led
Is this insufficient ?
