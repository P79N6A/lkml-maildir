I'm a user. When I insert a card "into my laptop" I'd like it to work as
advertised. If it doesn't work as advertised(because of some hardware
failure in this case), I'd like the kernel to more or less let me know
that something went wrong so I can return it. I wouldn't expect the kernel
to freeze.
Faulty hardware is very common in the PC era. I agree that it is hard to
pin down hardware malfunctions when you don't know what to check
for. However, There should be concern when it takes your whole system
down.
I guess this issue can be disregarded but it'll only make the kernel as
strong as its weakest link.
