I mean make updating pte_t and pmd_t entries that refer to identity
mapped physical pages unconditional.

Hmm.  I now see your problem.

Yes.  However how do we handle attempting to create this kind
of mapping when mmap /dev/mem?  or /dev/kmem?
I'm pretty certain there are other paths through the kernel where
we can get page table mapping.
Right now by leaving things read-only you are hiding from the kernel 
what you are really trying to do.  That makes me distinctly
uncomfortable.  In general when things get swept under the rug
we can never handle the properly.  Although this issue may be small
enough it doesn't matter.
I suspect what we want to do is come up with a function to call
to test to see if a page should be read-only and map such pages
_PAGE_KERNEL_RO, or _PAGE_KERNEL_RO_EXEC if it's code.
Speaking of things what are paravirt_alloc_pd and parafirt_alloc_pd 
supposed to do?
