hash tables work by showing very good *average* behavior.  if that isn't
good enough, don't use a hash table :)
if you're careful about choosing your hash function and testing it with
the actual data you plan to store in the table, you should get perfectly
reasonable overall results.  worst-case isn't something you need to be
concerned about unless your hash function is unavoidably terrible.
