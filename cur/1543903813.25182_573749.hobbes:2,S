I'm less interested in why this gives a warning, more interesting is the 
code:
        __unsafe(THIS_MODULE);
@Rusty:
As far as I understand it, __unsafe() wasn't intended for such a usage, 
and simply not providing an exit function would be the right solution?
If this is true, and since the MOD_INC_USE_COUNT compat code is long 
gone, shouldn't we be able to completely remove __unsafe() and the 
struct member "unsafe"?
