proc_misc_init() has both these lines in it:
entry = create_proc_entry("kmsg", S_IRUSR, &proc_root);
proc_root_kcore = create_proc_entry("kcore", S_IRUSR, NULL);
Both entries show up in /proc, as /proc/kmsg and /proc/kcore.  So I ask,
as I can't see after several minutes of examination, what's the
difference?  Why is NULL used for some and &proc_root used for others?
I'm looking at 2.6.10
