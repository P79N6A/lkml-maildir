Hello Tejun,

Waoh, you are using crystal ball ? :) You are right, this is a Maxtor
disk, 250 MB. If you want more details about this disk, I can send you
a complete details.

I'm just slightly worried about that, and because all this libata
stuff is quite "new", I prefer to report everything I can see, considering
that I can test patches on this machine if people need me to do so.
So, consider this machine as some kind of playground if you have
some code you want someone to test.

Yes, that's what I should do, but I've never really like that stuff ;(

OK, will try this tonite (I'm sorry, this is my home comp., and I'm at the
office right now - will tell you tomorrow).

Will do, and will test more if you more that are to be tested !
BTW, maybe OT, but what about setting a list of people willing to test
patches together with their configurations so that they can be send
patches related to their hardware ? That could be useful to people developing
drivers...
