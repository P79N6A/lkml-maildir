hi,
okay, not of grave significance, but it used to work.
i'm new to this so i'm not sure what info you might need. here's
the tail-end from 'strace eject'. hdc is my cd drive and it's
not mounted.
munmap(0x4000b000, 4096)                = 0
fstat(3, {st_mode=S_IFIFO|S_ISGID|S_ISVTX, st_size=0, ...}) = 0
ioctl(3, FIBMAP, 0x804ba20)             = -1 EINVAL (Invalid argument)
ioctl(3, CDROMEJECT, 0x4000a3c8)        = -1 EBUSY (Device or resource
busy)
write(2, "eject: CDROMEJECT ioctl failed f"..., 71eject: CDROMEJECT ioctl
failed for `/dev/hdc': Device or resource busy
) = 71
_exit(1)    
sorry if i'm just wasting space here.
keith.
