What do you mean with "claim". You never check the contents of the
bh->b_data that you get from bread.
Anyway you should always call the bd_op->open/release of the blockdevice
before/after calling bread/brelse. All the media_change stuff is done at
blockdevice open time. If you don't open it, the media_change won't be
detected.
