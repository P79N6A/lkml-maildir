I response to mouse wheel support, please check out imwheel at
http://solaris1.mysolution.com/~jcatki/imwheel
 .  It implements gpm extensions
as well as working just with XFree86.  when running with gpm it uses
/dev/gpmwheel as a fifo for wheel events from the mouse.  That means that this
imwheel version of gpm is ready for some method of interfacing the mouse wheel
with the console, and in fact I have been looking for ways to do this!
