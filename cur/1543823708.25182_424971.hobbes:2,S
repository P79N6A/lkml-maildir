Subject: [patch 2.6.17-rc4] i386: let usermode execute the "enter"  instruction
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/5/17/304

The i386 page fault handler does not allow enough slack when
checking for userspace access below the current stack pointer.
This prevents use of the enter instruction by user code.  Fix
this by allowing enough slack for "enter $65535,$31" to execute.
Problem reported by Tomasz Malesinski <tmal@mimuw.edu.pl>
