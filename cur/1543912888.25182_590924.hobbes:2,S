no, when generating those numbers i used:
  CONFIG_CC_OPTIMIZE_FOR_SIZE=y
  # CONFIG_FORCED_INLINING is not set
(but i also re-did it for all the other combinations of these build 
flags and similar results can be seen - your patch, despite removing 
lots of source code, produces a larger sched.o.)

some changes did slip into your patch that have no other purpose but to 
reduce code size:
  +#ifdef CONFIG_SMP
          unsigned long cpu_load[CPU_LOAD_IDX_MAX];
  +#endif
  [...]
  +#ifdef CONFIG_SMP
   /* Used instead of source_load when we know the type == 0 */
   unsigned long weighted_cpuload(const int cpu)
   {
          return cpu_rq(cpu)->ls.load.weight;
   }
  +#endif
  [...]
so i thought you must be aware of the problem - at least considering how 
much you've criticised CFS's "complexity" both in your initial review of 
CFS (which included object size comparisons) and in this patch 
submission of yours (which did not include object size comparisons
though).

debugging disabled of course. (your patch has a self-validity checking 
function [verify_queue()] that is called on SCHED_DEBUG=y, it would have 
been unfair to test your patch with that included.)
