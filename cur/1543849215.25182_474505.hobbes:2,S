Have you ever read the PCI-to-PCI Bridge Architecture Specification?
The default of VGA Enable bit is 0. This mean video ROM doesn't forward
system RAM at 0xC0000. 
There is your VGA card under 0001:00:00.0 Host bridge. The VGA Enable bit
in this host bridge will return 0 and IORESOURCE_ROM_SHADOW won't set.

It's impossible that multiple VGA cards, which have not the expansion
ROM, exist in a system regardless of multiple PCI domain system.

pci_fixup_video is also perfectly fine on IA64. And VGA is historical
device of x86 platform.
