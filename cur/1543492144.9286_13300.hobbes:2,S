Yep.

s/the suid bit/an ext2 inode flag/ and I'll be convinced.  One of the nice
things about the current ELF loader is that it doesn't have to dig too
deeply in the executables.

Cruft.  Look at the subject - we're not talking about existing systems. 
This is a new and probably incompatible filesystem.
Personally, I hope that ext3 won't bother with providing backwards
compatibility to old kernels, but rather will clear out old backwards
compatibility code, add the exciting new stuff (ACLs, capabilities) and
fix some things (bigger [ug]id_t, dev_t, (off_t?)).  The rest is missing
the point, IMHO.
