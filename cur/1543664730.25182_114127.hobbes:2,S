How close is 
http://www.bitmover.com/EXPORT
 to what you want (3MB file).
Note that this is very coarse granularity, it's very 2.5.62 up to 2.5.63,
in practice the granularity would be as least as fine as each of Linus'
pushes and finer if possible.  We can't capture all the branching structure
in patches, there is too much parallelism, but what we can do is capture
each push that Linus does and if he did more than one merge in that push,
we can break it up into each merge.  
We can also provide this as a BK url on bkbits for any cset or range of
csets (we'll have to get another T1 line but I don't see way around that).
This should give enough information that anyone could build their own 
BK 2 SVN gateway (or whatever, we're doing the CVS one).
Also, here's what Linus' recent pushes look like WITHOUT breaking it into
each merge, we're still working on that code:
