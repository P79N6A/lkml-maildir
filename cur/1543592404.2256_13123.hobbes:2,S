My smp alpha box drives a single tulip over 12MB/sec in full duplex
using tcp without any problem at all. So I definitely cannot reproduce.
You may want to try to reproduce with 2.4.5pre6aa1 btw. If you've not
tried it yet you can consider also using egcs 1.1.2 as compiler just in
case.
You may also want to keep an eye on the VM, on alpha I see very weird
things happening.
