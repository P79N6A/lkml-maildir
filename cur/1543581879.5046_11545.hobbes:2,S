Looks ok, but I wonder if we should include this list in the docs.
These is stuff defined by the PCI spec, and this list could potentially
get longer...  (opinions either way wanted...)

Maybe note that the return value comes from @ids (in case that isn't
abundantly clear to everybody)?

Definitely mention that the driver remains registered even if the return
value is zero.  That trips a lot of people up (as we saw.. :))

Clarify "chance to clean up" as calls each driver's remove() method...

Mention the case where pci_compat_driver is returned...
