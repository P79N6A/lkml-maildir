Hmm, let's see.  Configure.help says:
  Emulate Sun NFS daemon
  CONFIG_NFSD_SUN
    If you would like for the server to allow clients to access
    directories that are mount points on the local filesystem (this is
    how nfsd behaves on Sun systems), say yes here. If unsure, say N.
Ah, I see!  That's the equivalent to unfsd's "--re-export" option, right?
So the only way to export say a multigigabyte FTP server without to much
hassle is to put the filesystem on a software RAID or LVM.  (Which i had
so i did not experience that particular problem in the first place.)
That's suboptimal. Seems like closer examination of the code was just put
on my schedule...
Yours,
  Dominik
