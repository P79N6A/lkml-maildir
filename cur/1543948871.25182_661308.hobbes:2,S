I can use the mmap_sem.

I don't exactly see what "buggy macro" meant? I already use
parenthesis as needed to avoid the need of local variables to be
safe. Not really sure what's buggy, sorry!

I thought I tried the (void) but it didn't work and your solution
worked, but perhaps I did something wrong, I'll try again with (void)
nevertheless.

Agreed, the current construct come from the fact we previously didn't
assume nobody could ever call mmu_notifier_unregister by the time
mm_users is 0.

Calling __free_page out of the PT lock is much bigger
change. do_wp_page will require changes anyway when the sleepable
notifiers are merged.

The point is that it can't make a difference right now, and my
objective was to avoid unnecessary source code duplication (later it
will be necessary, right now it isn't). By the time you rework
do_wp_page, removing _notify will be a very minor detail compared to
the rest of the changes to do_wp_page IMHO. Expanding it now won't
provide a real advantage later.
