"probably"? Why not check the facts. 2.95.3 implements ".name ="
initialisers, and 2.95.3 is also listed in 2.4.18's Documentation/Changes
as the oldest acceptable compiler.
I agree with Keith that we really should prefer standard C solutions
over gcc-specific hacks _when_they_exist_.
Also note that gcc is no longer the only compiler able to compile the
kernel. Intel claims that their icc6 compiler has correctly compiled 2.4.18
with only minor tweaks needed. They do implement inline asm() nowadays, but
alas not &&label and computed gotos.
