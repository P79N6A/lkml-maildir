The variation in times from one call to the next seems to be
greater than the time to evaluate 4 "%d" arguments.
So we are back to how to get a timestamp in printk().
Earlier I said that it would be possible to provide a simplified
do_gettimeofday() call that met the no locks requirement.  I still
think this is possible, but most architectures would only get
jiffie resolution from this (only ia64, sparc64 and HPET users
have time interpolators registered).
