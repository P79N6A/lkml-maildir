   I'm fairly sure that under 2.0 kernels, if a filesystem had been
   unused for a long period of time, it would be marked with
   EXT2_VALID_FS - with the highly desirable effect that if the machine
   subsequently crashed, the filesystem wouldn't need a fsck.
Nope, it never did that.
You could potentially do something like that, but it would mean that
whenever you tried to write to the filesystem (including inode atime
updates), all modifications would have to stall until the EXT2_VALID_FS
bit was cleared.  It's doable, but it's not clear it's worth it.
