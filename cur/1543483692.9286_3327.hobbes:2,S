ASIC people too, and they really do want it as generic buffers.
Here (my workplace, not zip) we're readily getting into ASIC simulation work
which wants buckets of memory. Intel boxes are cheap CPU and if/when our
design tools get ported to Linux we would probably be very happy to have
2G+ of RAM.
Of course, that only gets us to 4G. It may be that when we get well
over 2G we'll want to step straight to a 64bit platform (like the
Ultras we're running now anyway).
