Hi all,
I've been running a Quad PPro 200 SMP box on  kernels ~2.1.70 upwards
and have never had this problem until my last upgrade from 2.1.128 to
2.2.3.
The box contains 2x Adaptec 7880 SCSI controllers which fail to get
identified at boot, despite the AIC-7xxx driver being compiled in. By
inserting various debug printk's into the source we've tracked the code
down to the detect routines (basically a pci_scan_bus) for the
controller, but then nothing is found.
Putting Printk's into the PCI routines seem to show that the kernel
never looks at the second PCI bus in the system. Now unfortunalty all
the SCSI controllers are on the motherboard so I don't have to option of
moving them.
Now I know that the PCI code has been overhauled in the time period I'm
talking about, so does anybody have any idea what the difference maybe.
When I get back to the machine (it's about 200 miles away at the moment)
I'll post a /proc/pci output if people will find it useful.
Thanks
Paul
P.S. If people could cc: my work address <paul.sargent@3dlabs.com> I'd
be grateful. I don't think I could handle the volume on this list at the
moment.
Kudos to the maintainer of the Kernel Traffic Site that allows me to
keep up to date.
