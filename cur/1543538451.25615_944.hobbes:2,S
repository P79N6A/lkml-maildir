That doesn't help much.
Just have a look at the Fraunhofer lawyers sending evil letters to mp3
implementors.  Same situation.  The ITU standard says "be wary" but
doesn't list the patents and only specifies the decoder, so when you
implement the encoder, you have to innovate the algorithms.
The Fraunhofer patent applies nonetheless.
It is to my knowledge normal for international standards to only specify
half of the stuff so the participants can file the other half as patent.
Even if the research was paid for with tax money.
Yes, the world is ridiculous.
