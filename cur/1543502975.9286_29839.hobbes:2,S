Great !

Okay. Maybe it is more realistic to get all this done for i386 systems
first and AFTER that start worrying about other systems, as we both have
no experience with other architectures.

I see it this way:
1. CONFIGIGURE
  a. Find out as much as possible about the system via autodetect.
     This identifies only hardware components.
  b. Complete these informations with some SIMPLE questions about the
     system. E.g. if there was no sound card found ask if he really
hasn't
     got one.
  c. Write all this information in a file (e.g. systeminfo).
  d. Use systeminfo and a database (maybe also a file, e.g. configdata)
     to set as many options as possible and to identify options that can
     be suggested to the user.
  e. Ask the user about the suggested options.
  f. Ask the user about options that are not system related.
  g. Write the found set of options to a file (e.g. .config)
  h. Let the user have a last look on all options in the old style if
     everything is fine. So he can change some things. Maybe just for
     experts ?
2. COMPILE
3. INSTALL
I was thinking that you work on 1a. I work on 2 and 3.
I think the really hard part will be 1d-g as it might become really
complex and it will decide if we fail or not on the whole part 1. It
should really simplify the configuration process otherwise it is
useless.
You could write the results in a file that could look like this:
# Config file form autoconfig
CPU=686
SERIAL=y
PARPORT=y
PCIBUS=y
SCSI=y
IDE=y
SOUND=n
BIOS=AWARD .....
ETHERNET=n
PCICARD="Soundblaster PCI64V"
ISACARD="NE 2000"
AGPCARD="ASUS 3400 TNT"
VLBCARD=
If we aren't able to do 1d-g this STILL would be a really good tool to
get some informations about your system, not only for compiling a
kernel.
There might be already some tools out there that we could use instead of
writing our own one.
What do you think ?
Bye,
 Steffen
