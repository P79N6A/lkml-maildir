OK, this is not related to what we were discussing (IO latency).  It's not too
hard to fix, we just need to do a little aging whenever there are allocations,
whether or not there is memory_pressure.  I don't think it's a real problem
though, we have at least two problems we really do need to fix (oom and
high order failures).
