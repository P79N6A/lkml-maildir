OK, I tried the patch with 2.6.17 and it didn't work. My laptop failed
to resume on the first try, so it must be something else. Could someone
actually have a look at the changes in 2.6.12-rc5-git6 (which happen to
be cpufreq-related)? I spend months pinpointing the problem to that
version (it's takes several days to reproduce). I'd appreciate if
someone could at least have a look at what changed there and maybe fix
it.
Thanks,
