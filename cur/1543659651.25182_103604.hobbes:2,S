    Yes, this is a good solution, too. The problem with all solutions
is that they involve a good bunch of code for a thing that doesn't
deserve it ;))
    Moreover, since I must preserve the environment and I'm pretty
sure that there is no arg except argv[0], I end up with the same
problem. The user may install this bit of crap under name '/i', for
example, and then I have only two characters for the new name :((
    Thanks for your help :)
