Doing this is either pointless or impossible on newer SATA controllers. 
  Most are memory-mapped I/O not PIO, where the high-order bits of the 
ATA taskfile are accessed due to an extended register size, not 
"double-pumping" a FIFO.
Even-newer SATA controllers are FIS-based rather than taskfile-based, so 
you pass it a FIS (containing all the registers) unconditionally.
