Atleast on x86_64, this depends on cpu_possible_map and not NR_CPUS.

I see a 0.5% perf improvement on database workload(which is a good
improvement for this workload). This patch is minimizing number of cache
lines that it touches during a remote task wakeup.
Kiran, can you educate me when I am supposed to use
____cacheline_aligned_in_smp
Vs
__cacheline_aligned_in_smp ?

Yes. But that will still waste some memory in the new section, if the data
elements are not multiples of 4k.
