Oddly enough, I don't see those functions being used in aops:
const struct address_space_operations reiserfs_address_space_operations = {
        .writepage = reiserfs_writepage,
        .readpage = reiserfs_readpage,
        .readpages = reiserfs_readpages,
        .releasepage = reiserfs_releasepage,
        .invalidatepage = reiserfs_invalidatepage,
        .sync_page = block_sync_page,
        .write_begin = reiserfs_write_begin,
        .write_end = reiserfs_write_end,
        .bmap = reiserfs_aop_bmap,
        .direct_IO = reiserfs_direct_IO,
        .set_page_dirty = reiserfs_set_page_dirty,
};
Plus, reiserfs seems to compile with that patch I just sent.  Sure as
heck surprised me.
