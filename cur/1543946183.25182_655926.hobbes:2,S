Although this probably isn't what you were asking for, i anyway started
to put some of the basic things about linux-next together and filled a
naive little webpage with it:
http://linux.f-seidel.de/linux-next/
while the wiki there is probably most interesting as it e.g. already
contains some info about those quilt comments and is amazingly easy to
adapt and enhance.
Thanks,
Frank
