Well, I found an approach to fix this:
 - create directory /proc/mount in which each mount point appears as
   /proc/mount/<kdevname> link. This way, all mount points can be
   reached via proc, independent of the current root. (*)
 - prepend d_path(proc_dir)/mount/kdevname(mnt_sb->s_dev) to the path
   obtained via d_path(mnt_sb->s_root) iff the latter does not end at
   the current process' root
(* I also need to check if the aliasing upsets dcache. I doubt it,
   though.)
Since anybody who reads /<proc>/mounts obviously has /<proc> (which
may of course be at some other place than /proc), this yields valid
path names again. People doing
chroot /somewhere cat /proc/mounts | do_domething
deserve whatever they get ;-)
Subtle problem: constructing the current proc_dir path can be a bit
of a nightmare, because this information is stripped long before
calling get_filesystem_info or such. I'm not convinced fixing
/proc/mounts is really worth this.
A less intrusive, but unfortunately also less elegant approach would
be to prepend the kdevname to /proc/mounts if the path can't be
constructed, and to leave it to the application to figure out what
to do. E.g.
/dev/hda1 /foo ext2 rw 0 0	-> it's on /foo
/dev/hda2 03:03/bar ext2 rw 0 0	-> it's on /proc/mount/03:03/bar
				   (detection: path doesn't begin with "/")
Since every program reading /proc/mounts knows where /proc is, we
also don't need to encode any such policy in the kernel in this
case.
Disadvantage of the second approach: each application that reads
/proc/mounts needs to be aware of the new convention.
Opinions ? Strong objections to /proc/mount/<kdevname> in general ?
