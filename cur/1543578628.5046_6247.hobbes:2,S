Abit designed the board wrong.  there are things you can do to reduce 
the incidence of this error: upgrading the bios, better cooling, more
powerful power supply, replacing an out-of-spec capacitor (if v1.1).
jeez, it's almost like a 12-step program for recovering from BP6ing ;)

indeed: the error still happens in 2.2, but is simply not reported.
note also that this message is a *warning* - an inter-apic message 
was corrupted, and automatically retried.
