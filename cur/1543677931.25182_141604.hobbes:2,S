	The slippery slope isn't important.  POSIX specifies EAGAIN
(you concede that), EBADF, and EINVAL against nbytes|offset|reqprio.
The kernel does these checks already (where applicable).
	Anyway, a caller of io_submit() already has to handle errors.
Just like a short read, you always have to be wary of them.
