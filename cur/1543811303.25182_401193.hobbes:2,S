Speaking of which...  Shouldn't git clone bring in .git/HEAD for rsync:// URLs?
As it is, we end up with HEAD pointing to refs/master, which might simply
not be there.  For git:// we get .git/HEAD same as in remote repository,
so behaviour for rsync:// probably should be the same...
Looks like a missing rsync in git-clone, around
        rsync://*)
                rsync $quiet -av --ignore-existing  \
                        --exclude info "$repo/objects/" "$GIT_DIR/objects/" &&
                rsync $quiet -av --ignore-existing  \
                        --exclude info "$repo/refs/" "$GIT_DIR/refs/" || exit
