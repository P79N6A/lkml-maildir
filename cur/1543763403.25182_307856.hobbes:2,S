    Thanx for your feedback. I got it working, but I don't think the 
patch is the best. Here is the patch, and the information, but if you 
can recommend a different way to fix it, let me know. The patch was done 
by Peter Horton.
Here is the link to the full patch, 
http://ftp.jg555.com/patches/raq2/linux/linux-2.6.11.6-raq2_fix-2.patch

I verified that there are no differences.

Applied the patch, here is the output

I was able to get some more information on the bootup sequence with the 
updates.
Here is the output now from the driver
