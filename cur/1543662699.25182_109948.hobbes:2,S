Hi,
Trying to compile 2.5.61 on an Athlon. (with K7 optimisations)
make && make modules_install appear to work fine, but the last thing I see 
before being dumped back to the prompt is this:
WARNING: /lib/modules/2.5.61/kernel/drivers/isdn/hisax/hisax.ko needs unknown 
symbol kstat__per_cpu
FIrst question - has anyone had this card working in 2.5.x ?
Second, is this a known problem or am I doing something daft?
I've grepped the kernel tree and the only references I can find are:
[root@rebecca linux-2.5.61]# grep -R kstat__per_cpu *

I have modutils-2.4.21-14 and module-init-tools-0.9.9 (both from rusty on 
kernel.org)
Under 2.4.20, the card is reported by lspci -v as:
00:0d.0 Network controller: Elsa AG QuickStep 1000 (rev 02)
        Subsystem: Elsa AG QuickStep 1000
        Flags: medium devsel, IRQ 11
        Memory at eb001000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=128]
        I/O ports at e400 [size=128]
        I/O ports at e800 [size=4]
        Expansion ROM at <unassigned> [disabled] [size=64K]
Thanks,
Mark.
