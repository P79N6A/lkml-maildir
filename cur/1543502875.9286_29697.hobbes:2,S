Have you tried other WMs? GNOME /w E , and KDE are like molasses
anyway.
I tried KDE, and GNOME w/ E  on a Sparc20/71 under Solaris and it was
just as
bad as on a x86 under Linux. If you want speed, try the lighter WM's.

E is doing too many things to be very responsive. Which redraws are
you wanting
to delay? Example, in E turn off all the fancy stuff (Like sliding
windows and
tool-tips) and set the resize and move methods to box, and it picks-up
a lot.
