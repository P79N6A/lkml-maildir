First sector contains valid partition table, but all partitions are
set to type 0x55, EZDrive. AFAIK EZDrive synchronizes this inivisble
partition with one from sector 2 on each reboot. Second sector contains 
'real' partition table, with types set to Linux, Linux swap, VFAT and
so on. I do not have extended partition on the drive, so I do not know
whether this record will have 0x55 or correct type in the sector 1.
Problem only occurs when you'll run LILO (if you have installed it
in /dev/hdx instead of in /dev/hdx#), or install-mbr - it will overwrite
ezdrive, and you have to find diskette and reinstall EZDrive to make
disk bootable in this obsolete system (btw, it is PentiumII).
So only problem is that we do not have special /dev/hdx-mbr device
for accessing MBR, all code expects that it is in first sector of the 
/dev/hdx, while with 0_to_1 remap it is in second one.
