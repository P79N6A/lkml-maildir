To do this efficiently this requires allocate on write support which
is just being developed for the kernel.  But the dirty data in the page
cache certainly helps.  And since the 2.2.x code didn't use the page cache
it was a challenge to port forward.  For most users disks have gotten
so big that it isn't much of an issue anymore.
Though seeing as I have filled my 20GB disk with code it might be worth
taking a look at.
