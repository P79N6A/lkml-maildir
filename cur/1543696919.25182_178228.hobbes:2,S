I think that might be harder than you think but you're right, we wouldn't be
too thrilled with that.  If for no other reason than the amount of cursing
you'd do as you figured out that our protocol is pretty ad-hoc and should be
rewritten.

You're already a BK user and I'd happily make it clear that it is OK for you
to do this work, we can have that discussion offline.  As for hassle free, 
I don't get that comment at all.  What you describe is exactly what we would
do anyway.  The only difference is that we could extend the bkd itself to
answer these requests and you couldn't without a lot of headaches.  But if 
you built this and wanted us to included it in the bkd, we'd look at doing 
that.
The points are
    a) I'm not at all convinced this is going to make anyone other than you
       happy.  They all want a BK replacement, not a tarball+patch replacement.
    b) If I'm wrong, there isn't anything preventing you from building this.
Convince me that (a) is all wrong and I'll see about building it.
So far, all the other people have made it clear they want all the
functionality of BK, the transport, the diffs, the history, etc.
Giving them a tarball/patch transport isn't like to make them happy and
I'll be in another one of these conversations after having wasted a pile
of engineering (which is not free, nor cheap).
