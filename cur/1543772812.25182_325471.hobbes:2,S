I know several projects that sort on inode number and benefit from that,
sometimes in a big way. The effect of this will probably be less on a
matured filesystem image.
I can't really explain why it helps though. I don't think the kernel will do
'crossfile readahead', although your disk might do so.
Google on 'orlov allocator', is enlightning.
