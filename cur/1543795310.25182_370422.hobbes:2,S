If you you are referring to the ARM Integrator/AP platform, I tested
it earlier this year, with a 2.6.12 kernel, and the e100.c driver
seemed to be OK with an NFS-mounted root filesystem and the IP address
got via kernel DHCP. I had problems getting the eepro100.c driver to
work though, but I didn't dig any further since e100.c seemed OK.
I'll give it another try early next week with 2.6.15-rc2 and let you
know whether I see any problems.
