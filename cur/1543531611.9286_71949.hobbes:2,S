If you visit comp.std.c on a regular basis, you'll find that there
regular arguments about the exact meaning of the C standard, which can
hinge of things that the text implies without stating them explicitly.

And how do you know the system may have been OOM, if you get a report
from someone else who may not have realised this?  Bear in mind that
an OOM situation may not have been logged in the syslog, or left any
sign other than "randomly" crashing processes.

I don't.  But surely you're aware that the typical reason for a
process being sent SIGBUS or SIGSEGV is a program bug.  This as
opposed to SIGHUP, SIGTERM, and most of the other signals.
In a similar vein, if a process dies due to SIGXCPU or SIGXFSZ that
you know it dies because it ran into a cpu or file limit.  Yes, I
would like to have some OS support from an overcommitting OS, so that
if it decides to kill a process of mine because it ran out memory I
get SIGXMEM instead of SIGBUS.

One thing that you should bear in mind is what would happen if
"everyone" (i.e., most of the processes of your normal workload) use
these techniques.  For example, if they all use mlock, you find that
(1) they all need to run as (setuid) root, and (2) you might as well
run without swap on a non-overcommitting system.  That is not an
optimal outcome.

Which doesn't mean the current implementation cannot be improved upon.
There is sufficient room for improvement that it is certainly arguable
that right now the kernel doesn't keep track of memory the right way.
