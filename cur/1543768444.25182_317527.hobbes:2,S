Do you mean to say you want to change the namespace when a process
changes to a directory which belongs to that namespace?
Well it makes it totally confusing. A user would start seeing different
set of mounts suddenly as he changes directories beloning to different
namespaces. I am not sure, if changing namespace implicitly is a good
idea. Not saying its a bad idea, but seems to change my notion of
namespaces completely. 
I think a process should have access to one
namespace at any given point in time, and should have the ability
to explicitly switch to a different namespace of its choice, provided
it has enough access permission to that namespace.
having the ability to access two namespaces simultaneously can allow
cross contamination. Which essentially makes namespaces as a concept
irrelevent.
