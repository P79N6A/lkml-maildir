A fair amount, so long as drivers above it don't need to
change much at all (this is "stable").  That includes
usbcore and all the usb drivers.

It's heading that way already ... breaking along the lines
where standard APIs solve problems, such as this.

For example, if usbaudio uses usb_buffer_alloc to stream data,
that eliminates dma bouncing.  That's dma_alloc_coherent at
its core ... it should allocate from that 32K region.
