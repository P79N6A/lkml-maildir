Subject: Arla + kth-krb 0.10.1 + 2.2.12 = many oops

As was suggested, I upgraded from kth-krb 0.9.6 to 0.10.1 so I could get
the latest version of arla to compile.  And compile it did.  However I now
have a syslog full of oopes.  Lots and lots of oopes.  It seems to have
something to do with krb0.10.1.  Arla doesn't seem to be the problem as
I tested multiple versions.
I have now returned to using kth-krb 0.9.6.  My system is
back to normal.  Attached is one of my many oopes that has been run
through ksymoops.
Linux version 2.2.12 (root@excalibur) (gcc version 2.7.2.3) #1 Thu Aug 26
21:28:51 EDT 1999
I compiled krb with egcs 1.1.2, Arla with 2.7.2.3.  Could this be the
source of my problem?  
What caused the oops you might ask.  Well after compiling krb0.10.1 and
arla and installing them both and checking the configuration I ran arla in
test mode.  Worked great.  Started arla like normal.  I have a sym link in
my home dir to my home dir in AFS space and sometimes it takes ls a few
seconds to see that my home dir in AFS exists so it knowns what color to
make the sym link.  I did an ls and it just stopped.  ^C gave no responce.
I supect (as it has happened before) that ls was stuck in the D state.
Now here's the wierd part.  I go to another terminal to check on my stuck
ls and do a ps ax.  My kernel oopes, ps segfaults.  Run top: oops and
segfault.  Run w: oops and segfault.  It seems to be the same oops.  I
have a syslog full of 'em if you'd like to look.  
Any ideas?

You did not tell me where to find symbol information.  I will assume
that the log matches the kernel and modules that are running right now
and I'll use the default options above for symbol resolution.
If the current kernel and/or modules do not match the log, you can get
more accurate output by telling me the kernel version and where to find
map, modules, ksyms etc.  ksymoops -h explains the options.
No modules in ksyms, skipping objects
