You can accomplish the same thing by using RCU directly without using so 
much storage. (and you said so later ...)

In this case the slab would allocate one page for the one cpuset. However, 
there are lots of control structures allocated for all nodes that would go
unused. The control structures are allocated when the slab is created.
