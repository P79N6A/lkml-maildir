Apparently not - the homebrew repeater has not been active pretty much
since I started to work on Atari in 2.6... time to kill that code.

You got that right.

That has to go as well (together with the repeater).

Could do that, yes. Christoph suggested to fold everythig into atakeyb.c
so modularization would go away here.

How so? If the core has been initialized already this will just return ...

The translation map should not have been overwritten like above, is that
what you mean?
My original patch didn't have that bit; scancodes were translated to
input keycodes using atakbd_keycode[scancode] instead. I'll have that
reverted...

Never tested, sorry.

OK; I'll delete this.

Not really ... I'll merge atakeyb.c, atakbd.c and atamouse.c and send a
new patch to Geert.
