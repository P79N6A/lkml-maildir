set_pte_atomic also requires atomicity in
asm-generic/pgtable.h:ptep_establish, but it's not even using volatile
and it's a 64bit pointer that we're writing to.  We're relaying on the
compiler to do the right thing for us. I don't think it's a good idea
for the long run, but Benjamin on ppc64 rejected my suggestion to
rewrite set_pte_atomic in asm, so I doubt you'll be able to rewrite
atomic_read with asm either (because at least atomic_read is an int and
not a long pointer, and at least atomic_read is a volatile unlike
set_pte).
My point is that even before worrying about the theoretical correctness
of atomic_read, I would suggest to worry about set_pte_atomic first,
which is a lot more likely to break if something. The compiler may truly
execute two separate writes if power of 2 bitshifts are involved, as the
optimal compilation of the C source.
