If and when 2.2.36 is released, I'm sure it will be very stable.
Actually, 2.2.10 has proven to be golden to me.

Ever consider hardware failure due to power spike or something along those
lines? Have you tried 2.2.1 on the same hardware? If anything, we'd like
to know when things stopped working correctly and if the hardware involved
is "known good".. there is a data corruption bug running around that
people have bumped into but I can't reproduce it. It looks like it is quota
related anyway.

Only one I can think of is the 2.2.8 fiasco and I agree with that was a bit
premature.

2.0 was maintained while 2.1 continued on. Same thing will happen here.

Hmm.. well, reporting them is a step in the right direction and not going
off on everyone that is here to help.

I'm sure a pre-2.2.11 will show up soon. Not all effort has been shifted to
2.3. Some of the 'interesting' stuff is happening in 2.3 but 2.2 has been
rock solid for me even in pre- form.

Alan has a lot on his plate.. you should check out his AC patches though.
