Hmm, are you working for Symbian? Because that's exactly how they track 
pending async operations (address of a status variable - wrapped in a 
class of course, being them) ;)
That's another way of doing it, IMO no better no worse than letting 
explicit cookie selection from userspace. You still have to have the 
compat code though, either ways.
