... if you give too many recipients in your post.  That is often
really annoying thing to me, together with keeping the unrelated
subject line ;)
I personally don't care whether it's a moderated or open list.
We chose it simply due to too bad S/N ratio at that time.  So, if the
current list annoys your or many others and the list management on
vger is so good, it'd be basically a good move, of course.  I'll
appreciate it.
The only confusion would be the change of ML address, but we can do it
slowly, too.
