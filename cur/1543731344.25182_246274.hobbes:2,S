  Yes, it is mostly in user land. But, It is still integrated with the
  Windows  API.  This  means that normal programs that use the Windows
  API  will  be  able to use most of the new features (like displaying
  thumbnails, filtered views, etc when you do file operations)
  Besides,  NTFS  is  not  that  bad. It does have both encryption and
  compression  and a big set of ACL features that aren't in most Linux
  filesystems today.

  I  agree.  Things  should be done because they are good, not because
  you are threatened to.
  It  is  a shame really that so many people hate Microsoft (or Apple)
  so much they fail to see things that actually are good.
