Detail info: the failed command always takes a touch more than 6.4 s to
timeout. Only the time until it happens for the first time differs.
It appears to me that the drive has an internal watchdog to wait for the
host to do something.
And directions how to dig up useful debug information for this issue?
Have there been related fixes in 2.6.16-rc* that make testing
worthwhile?
