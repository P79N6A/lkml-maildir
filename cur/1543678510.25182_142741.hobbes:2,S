well bk1 was released a few minutes/hours ago, and there aren't any changes 
for usb in there, so I'll wait for bk2 and fill in the bug report right away.
Ow another question what might be a bug or a poorly configured system,
My mp3 player is a usb memory pen too, when i write to it, it can handle 
300/400 kbps, my other memory pen (a real one, so non-mp3) can only handle 
100kbps. is this a bug? or because of the vfat fs ?
