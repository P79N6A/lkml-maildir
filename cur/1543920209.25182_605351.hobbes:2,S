Problem:
# CONFIG_VIDEO_V4L1_COMPAT is not set
The VID_HARDWARE_* defines are only created if that is turned on.  gemtek
should depend on VIDEO_V4L1_COMPAT.
*or*
As far as I can tell, these VID_HARDWARE defines are entirely useless.  I
couldn't find any instance of them being used for anything other than setting
the .hardware field of struct video_device, and I was unable to find any
instance of that field being used.
It looks like the whole thing is just unused cruft.  Mauro, would it be ok if
I made a patch to just delete the whole mess?
