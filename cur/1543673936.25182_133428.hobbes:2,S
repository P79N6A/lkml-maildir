ok here is what dmesg shows:
384MB LOWMEM available.
then further down:
Memory: 385584k/393216k available (2010k kernel code, 7244k reserved, 597k 
data, 128k init, 0k highmem)
now how is the little 38.../39... possible? 
and then top shows this:
Mem:    385712k total
this again is different than the others...
and finaly gkrellm is telling me that I have only 377 mb actually recognized 
out of the 384mb that the kernel detected above...
So the question is where does my 7mb go, why that weird 38.../39 difference 
and why does top report another different value.
