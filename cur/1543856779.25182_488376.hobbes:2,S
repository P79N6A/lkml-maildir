But it's very much NOT OK here:

And you know why? Because the C code in kernel has no character set.
Even if the holy penguin declares "we use UTF-8 now", it's still not ok,
because people routinely send patches in e-mail.
So, please don't do that. I do not put "Copyright (c) 2006 Петр Зайцев"
in my patches out of courtesy to you. You might not even have fonts
for that. Now I expect the same from you.
