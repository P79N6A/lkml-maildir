In 2.4.0-test9-pre7, uhci module does not reliably. I have a Logitech
N48 wheel mouse attached, it's the only USB device. I can use the mouse
fine in X via /dev/input interface (except that input moule's reference
count is still zero). But when I switch to text console (and maybe move
the mouse) and switch back to X, the mouse is dead. Unplug+plug cures it
until the next console switch. I have also a PS/2 mouse attached and I'm
using it via gpm on text consoles (if this is of any importance).
usb-uhci module seems to be OK. In 2.2.18pre12 backport, uhci seems to
work also, it's only 2.4 that's broken at the first glance.
USB controller is VIA KT133 onboard USB:
00:07.2 USB Controller: VIA Technologies, Inc. VT82C586B USB (rev 10)
00:07.3 USB Controller: VIA Technologies, Inc. VT82C586B USB (rev 10)
