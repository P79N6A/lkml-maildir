Compiling kernel 2.3.18 with HFS build-in (not a module)
i got this error:
fs/filesystems.a(hfs.o): In function `hfs_do_write':
hfs.o(.text+0x9fc1): undefined reference to `update_vm_cahce'
make: *** [vmlinux] Error 1
Anyone knows what does it mean?
(for me it sounds as misdependence)
i tried to make kernel by:
make mrproper
make menuconfig
make dep
make bzdisk
