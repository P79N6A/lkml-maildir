What was unclear with my first question? Can you try that?
To repeat it again:
%% When you not compile in the SKGE network driver does everything else work?
%% skge supports 64bit DMA, so it shouldn't use any IOMMU. 
Alternatively you can try with the appended patch. If that helps
then the chipset or the BIOS likely has some fundamental issue with >4GB.
