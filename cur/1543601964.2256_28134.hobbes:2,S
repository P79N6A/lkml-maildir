 Did you read and understand the Banga99 paper?
 But this is getting silly. We've agreed that
you don't like the changes, and I have agreed
to implement some of them in a new patch.
 Either I will implement what I said I would,
or I won't. And either it will be a better
mechanism, or it won't. 
 I suggest and end to pointless, insulting
sniping. Ok?
