Following is what I have committed in my tree to avod using the now
un-exported symbols.

    kbuild/xfs: introduce fs/xfs/Kbuild
    
    In kbuild the file named 'Kbuild' has precedence over the file named
    Makefile. Utilise a file named Kbuild to include the 2.6 Makefile for xfs
    - since the xfs people likes to keep their arch specific Makefiles separate.
    
    With this patch xfs does no longer rely on the KERNELRELEASE components to be global.
