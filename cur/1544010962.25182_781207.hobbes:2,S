Hi Sam,
Sorry for taking so long to get back to you, but my hard drive for my 
laptop is on the fritz, and I'm busy making sure everything is backed up.
I tried this patch and it does not seem to do what I want :-(
You can test it too, just compile the kernel with CONFIG_FUNCTION_TRACER
and CONFIG_DYNAMIC_FTRACE enabled, and then compile again with just 
disabling CONFIG_DYNAMIC_FTRACE (keep CONFIG_FUNCTION_TRACER enabled). If 
the entire kernel does not compile again, then it did not work.

Oh, you need to add this patch first:
