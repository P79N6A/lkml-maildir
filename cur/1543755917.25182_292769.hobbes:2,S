Hi Andrew,
I had the following errors while compiling 2.6.11-rc3-mm1:
In file included from include/asm/fixmap.h:27,
                 from arch/i386/kernel/asm-offsets.c:12:
		 include/asm/acpi.h: In function `acpi_noirq_set':
		 include/asm/acpi.h:160: error: `acpi_noirq' undeclared
		 (first use in this function)
		 include/asm/acpi.h:160: error: (Each undeclared
		 identifier is reported only once
		 include/asm/acpi.h:160: error: for each function it
		 appears in.)
		 include/asm/acpi.h: In function `acpi_disable_pci':
		 include/asm/acpi.h:163: error: `acpi_pci_disabled'
		 undeclared (first use in this function)
The following patch fixes it (it looks like bk-kconfig-acpi-fix.patch
was incorrect).
Regards,
Benoit
