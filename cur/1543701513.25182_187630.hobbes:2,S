It seems that the only place I can find the gcc with this bug (that
-Wall implies -Wsign-compare) is the gcc 3.3 that came with my SuSE
Linux 8.2 distribution.  Each of the 3.3, 3.3.1 and 3.3.2 versions
available at ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gcc are ok - no such bug.
So it's not a big deal either way whether to apply this patch.
  In the short term, it helps a very specific version of gcc.
  In the longer term, it clutters the top Makefile with a pimple
  to address a transient glitch.
  Technically it is a no-op for other gcc versions, since
  sign-compare is off in all other cases anyway.
I vote that you:
  ==> Drop my patch in the trash
in the interests of avoiding Makefile clutter.  Tell people like
me that if it hurts to use this gcc 3.3, then don't use it ;).
