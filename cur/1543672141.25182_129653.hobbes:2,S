actually what I have is:
thread 0:
pthread_create() (1)
pthread_create() (2)
thread 1:
open()
fcntl()
thread 2:
open()
fcntl()
etc
and they all succeed. Even though the file descriptors are different.

You digress, but I feel like I have to justify myself now :)
Those threads used to be processes and now want be threads with minimal 
modifications. The files that are locked are still used by other processes 
too.
