So, let's summarise what you've been saying in this thread so far:
o You want advance warning of API changes, but when you get them
  (devfs, for instance), you ignore them and complain anyway -- check
o You want security fixes and only minor other fixes (done magically
  by someone else as you're not willing to pay for it, nor are you
  willing to help yourself), for at least 6 months, but you ignore
  the existance of the 2.6.x.y kernel series, which does exactly
  that -- check
o You think that 2.4.x isn't supporting enough new hardware,
  and yet you claim that adding new PCI ID:s is enough to add
  support for new hardware in most cases -- check
o You're going on and on about API breakage between kernel and
  userspace, yet the only example you keep repeating is devfs -- check
So far, I'd say you're just trolling.  Please calm down, *breathe*,
and start reading what people actually respond to you, think it
through, and consider if maybe, just maybe, there might be more sense
in their opinions than in yours.  And maybe, just maybe, people that
spend a lot of their spare time (or work time, for that matter) to
give you for free (and FREE) the best kernel there is, deserve a
bit more than your whining.
Or in short:
"Don't complain, contribute!"
