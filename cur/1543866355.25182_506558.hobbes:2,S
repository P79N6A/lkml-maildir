No, it's really more fundamental than that.
Exactly because "char *" doesn't have a defined sign, only a TOTALLY 
INCOMPETENT compiler will warn about its signedness.
The user has clearly stated "I don't care about the sign". If a compiler 
complains about us passing "unsigned char *" (or, if "char" is naturally 
unsigned on that platform, "signed char *") to strcmp then that compiler 
IS BROKEN. Because "strcmp()" takes "char *", which simply DOES NOT HAVE a 
uniquely defined sign. 
That's why we can't have -Wpointer-sign on by default. The gcc warning is 
simply *crap*.
If you were to have
	extern int strcmp(signed char *);
and would pass *that* an "unsigned char", it would be a real and valid 
sign error. But just plain "char *" isn't signed or unsigned. It's 
"implementation defined", and as such, if the programmer used it, the 
programmer clearly doesn't care. If he cared, he would just state the 
signedness explicitly.
It really is that simple. gcc is broken. The C language isn't, it's purely 
a broken compiler issue.
The other things in the kernel I'd be willing to fix up. But I simply 
refuse to work around a known-buggy warning.
