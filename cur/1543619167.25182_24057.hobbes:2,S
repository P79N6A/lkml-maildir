Yes, we should cc our patches to a patchbot:
  patches-2.5@kernel.org -> goes to linus
  patches-2.4@kernel.org -> goes to marcello
  patches-usb@kernel.org -> goes to gregkh, regardless of 2.4/2.5
  etc.
The vast sea of eyeballs will do the rest.  A web interface would be a nice 
bonus, but 'patch sent and seen to be sent, to whom, when, what, why' is the 
essential ingredient.
