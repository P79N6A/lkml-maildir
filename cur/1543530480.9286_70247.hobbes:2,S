Because nobody was maintaining the kernel ones, Donald was providing pci_netif
stuff that ended up with cards listed 8 times. There is a point where you 
just have to say 'tough'. 
Other people have now picked up some of the card maintenance, it'll take them
time to get up to speed in places but they are closer to the mainstream
kernel and they are also having two more effects that are good for the
community. 
	They are reminding people that Don Becker doesn't write all
	the ethernet drivers and you can write them and work on them
	too. (which is exactly the same problem we had with sound
	and Hannu at one point)
	They will I hope give Donald more time to work on all the
	other stuff he is doing, and getting paid for.
