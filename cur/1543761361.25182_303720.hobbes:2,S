Okay, thank you for clearing up my confusion over how the GART
actually works. :-) I see you are right: my current patch is indeed
bogus, sorry about that. Unfortunately this means that some other
solution needs to be found for Xen....

Well, actually it has worked well for us so far. Our model of memory
allocation amongst Xen guests is fine-grained (page granularity). The
fact a guest can get random sparse physical pages does not fit well
with Linux's expectation (even with discontig-mem builds) of at least
getting fairly large contiguous physical chunks of RAM.
For this reason, we do rather abuse the notion of 'phys'
addresses. But we get away with it because it really doesn't matter to
the VM system that these addresses bear no relation to reality. In
most cases that it does matter it is because we are programming an I/O
device, in which case we have convenient hook points (bus-address
macros and the DMA-mapping interface). Another slightly tricky one was
block-I/O buffer merging but, again, we found a fairly clean way of
hooking that in an appropriate manner.
Even generic IOMMUs we will be able to handle -- we have control of
the DMA-mapping interface in arch/xen -- so it seems to be the case
that AGPGART is the one significant spanner in the works for us,
because it is an IOMMU in the form of a generic (arch-agnostic)
driver.
So: how about the following solution. It's a bit more distasteful
than I'd like, but I see no alternative apart from us maintaining an
out-of-tree patch to be applied only when building Linux for Xen.
What we need are four hook functions to be defined and used in place
of virt_to_phys, phys_to_virt, __get_free_pages, and
free_pages. Possible names might be:
  To go into asm/io.h:
     virt_to_fsb, fsb_to_virt, alloc_fsb_pages, free_fsb_pages
  Or, to go into asm/agp.h:
     agp_virt_to_phys, agp_phys_to_virt, agp_alloc/free_pages
The former names are an attempt to make the hooks a bit more 'generic'
by defining something applicable wherever you want an address that is
usable directly on the front-side bus. The latter are a bit hackier,
but then, maybe that is appropriate. :-)
I'd be happy to cook up a patch to do this if it isn't too offensive
for anyone.
