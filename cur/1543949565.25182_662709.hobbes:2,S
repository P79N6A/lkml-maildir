This may be more of a concern to anybody who wanted to change the driver 
core internals and might be unsure what to do with those three dev->sem 
taking sites which I added; not so much a concern from the firewire 
driver maintenance POV.
OTOH, contention for idr_rwsem is low and there can be multiple readers 
of course.  The most time consuming thing that could happen would be 
waiting for GFP_KERNEL allocations of new IDR tree leaves.  And maybe 
having the dev->sem in a cacheline but idr_rwsem not is probably not a 
concern for the stuff that the writer and the two readers of the ROM 
cache do.
Ah, wait, there is a 3rd reader: sbp2_probe's sbp2_scan_unit_dir.  So, 
using dev->sem is actually the nicest way for now.
