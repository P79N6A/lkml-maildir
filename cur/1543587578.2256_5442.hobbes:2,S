Not always firewall related.
There are companies like Zyxel that ship broken router
too.
For example the Zyxel 681 SDSL-Router breaks ECN by
stripping 0x80 (ECN Cwnd Reduced) but not 0x40 (ECN Echo)
(TOS bits) on all SYN packets (!).
I complained because of this two times more than a month ago
but they do not even respond.
I do not know if they are unable or just unwilling to fix it;
maybe they just unable to read RFC's.
