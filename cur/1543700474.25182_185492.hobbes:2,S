the sequence
	local_bh_disable();
	err = get_user(n, ptr);
	local_bh_enable();
	if (!err)

will do this in 2.6.x, except it will complain loudly about the unatomic 
access. Other than that, it will do what you ask for.
However, I'd still suggest not doing this. It's just broken. I don't see 
any real reason to do this except as a "test if the page is paged out" 
kind of thing..
