Hi,
The problem is that mmaping a segment <addr,len> from /dev/kmem gives
differnet results than reading the same <addr,len>.
It seems that the bug is that mmap_kmem is a macro for mmap_mem (for
/dev/mem).
mmap_mem maps a _physical_ offset into a vm area vma, while mmap_kmem
should map a _virtual_ offset into a vm area. 
I hacked it to work by copying mmap_mem to mmap_kmem and adding __pa() in
the proper assginment, but I don't know how to check if the offset is
valid in the kernel virtual memory. Maybe someone who knows the mm code
better can fix this?
Thanks,
Yoav Etsion
