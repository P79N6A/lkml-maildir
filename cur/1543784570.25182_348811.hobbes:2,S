Subject: [GIT PATCH] More PCI patches for 2.6.13
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/9/9/341

Here are some more PCI patches against your latest git tree.  Most of
them were just not applied to the last pci git pull, due to me messing
up the mbox that I applied to the tree.  They have been in the -mm tree
for a while.
The other two patches are a moving around of the pci probe functions so
that ppc has an easier time of future work, and I've sent in a pci quirk
that has been in the -mm tree for a while.
Please pull from:
	rsync://rsync.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/pci-2.6.git/
or if master.kernel.org hasn't synced up yet:
	master.kernel.org:/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/pci-2.6.git/
The full patches will be sent to the linux-pci mailing lists, if anyone
wants to see them.
thanks,
greg k-h
