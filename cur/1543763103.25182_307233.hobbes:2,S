Subject: [PATCH] ppc32: Fix MPC8555 & MPC8555E device lists (updated)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Andrew,
(As I decide how long to keep the paper bag on this time, here is an 
updated patch.  This one actually reduces the number of devices as well as 
removes the device from the lists which makes things work better :)
Removed the FCC3 device from the lists of devices on MPC8555 & MPC8555E
since it does not exist on these processors.
