Yes, you are correct, that is how the driver model currently works.

You have to go through a lot of pain to get it to work :)
Or create a virtual bus and devices, but that is not how scsi decided to
go about this.
I do have some half-baked patches to fix this in a generic way, to allow
multiple drivers to bind to devices, but it's not fully working right
now and I got side-tracked by having to clean up the kset/kobject/ktype
mess first to get this to work properly, so it might be a few months.
Why, is there some use for multiple drivers to devices that you want to
use?
thanks,
