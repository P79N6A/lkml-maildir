It should not when they are bounded to two separate CPUs, and are the
highest priority tasks on those CPUS.  That will be hard to explain, how a
the highest prio tasks bounded to a single CPU had an unbounded latency.
With the patches presented, this can happen.

Again, no performance is good enough for an RT task if it risks the
slightest chance of causing an unbounded latency.
