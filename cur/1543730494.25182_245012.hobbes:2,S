Why is it not nice? If the VM has decided to create 400MB of dirty
data on a DVD+RW packet device, I don't see a problem with submitting
all bio's at the same time to the packet device.
The situation happened when I dumped >1GB of data to a DVD+RW disc on
a 1GB RAM machine. For some reason, the number of pending bio's didn't
go much larger than 200000 (ie 400MB) even though it could probably
have gone to 800MB without swapping. The machine didn't feel
unresponsive during this test.
