The new SMP nice load balancing may cause some tasks to be skipped while 
it's looking for ones with small enough bias_prios but I doubt that this 
would cause many to be skipped on a real system.
BTW why do you assume that this problem is caused by can_migrate() 
failing and is not just simply due to large numbers of tasks needing to 
be moved (which is highly likely to be true when hackbench is running)?
If it is a "skip" problem that would make the "busting it up into 
smaller chunks" solution more complex as it would make it desirable to 
remember where you were up to between chunks.
