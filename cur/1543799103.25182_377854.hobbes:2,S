Hi David --
just a cuple of notes here and below...
General one: how is it supposed to set SPI bus clock in this model? I 
guess that the only option is to set it in txrx_*.
That is not optimal since it means setting clock for each transfer which 
is not an optimal solution, better have a function (bitbang->set_clock 
or whatever) )to set clock per message.

Suggest not to hardcode values here.

Suggest special enum/define for chipselect value.

Suggest nsecs here as well.
Generic note: haven't tested that with DMA, will have more comments 
prolly...
Another one: I just feel comfortabel with using 'bitbang' term for the 
variety of SPI stuff which this library suits.
