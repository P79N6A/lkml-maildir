Probably I didn't post them.  What I posted was a small subset of the full log.

Not all the way up to the new menu, but before the bits that depend on them,
which are in drivers/video/ drivers/media/video and drivers/ieee1394 IIRC.

I'm hoping to have an RPM out this weekend so you can do the augury yourself.

Apparently.  In the stock kernel:
warning:arch/mips/config.in:224:"CONFIG_KMOD" has overlapping definitions
warning:init/Config.in:19:location of previous definition
warning:arch/parisc/config.in:53:"CONFIG_KMOD" has overlapping definitions
warning:init/Config.in:19:location of previous definition
Did I mention Gordian knot?

There's two in the same file, lines 185 and 189.

Please ignore that one.  It's an artifact of the way I check for symbols
not declared anywhere at all, related to config.in's using the same banner
for a menu and a comment.
