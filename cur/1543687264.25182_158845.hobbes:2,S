I'm doing this in the device driver for the device, so I know it is ok to do.

In my case I need access to tables in the ROM.

My driver can be load/unloaded so I need to turn the ROM on each
time to get to the tables. I also don't like calling release_resource()
directly from my driver since that looks like an internal PCI driver call.
As to pcibios_resource_to_bus()....
I called pci_assign_resource() which calls pci_update_resource() 
which calls pcibios_resource_to_bus().
I see now that pci_assign_resource() will return with the ROM 
enabled. I believe I have also hit cases where ROM was assigned
an address but not enabled. Do I still need to call 
pcibios_resource_to_bus() if I am just enabling the ROM?
Do I need to call pcibios_resource_to_bus() when disabling the ROM?
