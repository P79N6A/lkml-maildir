I also had trouble with rc2-ac2.  I know Andre's been pushing IDE
changes through Alan, and from a quick scan through the rc3-ac1 patch
there's quite a bit of change in drivers/ide/alim15x3.c.
From Alan's changelog, it looks like there were "ALi IDE hang fixes"
from Sen Dong in pre4-ac4 that were never pushed to Marcelo (according
to the changelog).
