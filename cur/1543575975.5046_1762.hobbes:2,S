You meant "return" of course as you can't put a break there (there's no loop).
`return' doesn't define the fast path (but ok it's a minor issue and
I think latest gcc can use some stuff to define fast paths).
In general all I'm saying is that they don't want a label before the end of a
compound statement and that's a not interesting requirement IMHO that will just
force people to use one additional "suprious" `;' after the last label. It
doesn't make the code more readable and it doesn't give any advantage other
than maybe having simplified some formal language definition.
