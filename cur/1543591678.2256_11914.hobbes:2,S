I've seen this question several times in this thread. I haven't seen the  
obvious answer, though.
Have a new system call:
ctlfd = open_device_control_fd(fd);
If fd is something that doesn't have a control interface (say, it already  
is a control filehandle), this returns an appropriate error code.
This has another benefit, in that you can get control descriptors for  
stuff that doesn't currently have a filename (but does have ioctls), such  
as network sockets.
