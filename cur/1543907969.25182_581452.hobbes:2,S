Subject: [PATCH] [0/12] x86 Late merge bug fixes for 2.6.23
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/8/9/146

Various simple bug fixes, no new features. Please review.
I plan to send them to Linus later.
I don't have anything else critical pending. If you believe
a x86 patch is critical and really needs to make .23 please send email.
There are a few hardware fixes pending too, but they're not regressions
so probably .24 material.
Open problems:
- Still one known reference counting bug in c_p_a()
- x86-64 vdso compilation still broken on old debian binutils
* No satisfactionary workaround found so far. Those users might need to update
their binutils
