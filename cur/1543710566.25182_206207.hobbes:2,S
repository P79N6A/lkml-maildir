Hello,
I noticed that 2.6 kernel branch, have some problem with disk read/writes.
Today I talked a little with some of my friends, and they say that they don't have that problem, and that 2.6 I/O is acctualy faster than on 2.4 kernel version.
However, I did some kind of "tests" on both, 2.4 and 2.6 kernel, with hdparm(-t,-T) and dd(disk writes), and the results is what I expected to be ... 2.4 is faster than 2.6, but, I know that is not the best way to test these kind of things, so I was wondering, is there any "offical" words on this ? Tests ?
I supose ther are more people with this kind of problem(i talked to some of them on irc.freenode.net, #kernel and some of them said that have same problem).
Kind Regards,
S
