Wrong. "%cr2" is _not_ "corrupt". It has a well-defined value.
So what happens is
	get_user (or user-mode access)
		fault - set %cr2 to fault1
			irq
			vmalloc fault - set %cr2 to fault2
				fixup runs, iret
			irq runs, iret
		%cr2 is still %fault2
		vmalloc fault - nothing to do
		"false fixup" runs, iret
	get_user (or user-mode access)
		fault - set %cr2 to fault1
		... get the right behaviour now ...

As far as I can tell, there are no races anywhere. Just silly bugs that
are hard to see.
