Darn. The same PROBLEMS, not the same errors. Indeed, the errors are not
there. But the behaviour is still the same, i.e. slow speeds after a
while.. :/
But it's not as bad as it got a few minutes ago when I tested the driver
from scyld.com.. It totally trashed my NIC.. A shame though, since it ran
perfectly until it totally died.. I wan't a combination of those drivers..

Woohoo. Ehm. Nah. ;)
