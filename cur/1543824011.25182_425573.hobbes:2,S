why? this doesn't really sound like something that needs to be tunable
to that extend; either it's on or it's off (which is tunable already),
the exact amount should just be the right value. While I often disagree
with the gnome desktop guys, they have some point when they say that
if you can get it right you shouldn't provide a knob.
(if we would put a knob on everything that is a value in the kernel we'd
have five gazilion knobs)
