	Hello, world!\n
I have a new Opteron server based on Tyan Thunder K8S Pro (S882GNR) board.
The storage is 3ware 7506 controller with 4 disks in RAID-5. The system
has 4GB of RAM, and runs 2.6.1 kernel.
Problem 1:
	I have tried to run a test load (multiple kernel compiles using
make -j4, copying a filesystem subtrees, etc), and I have noticed that
all IRQs go to the CPU0 only. My /proc/interrupts says:
# cat /proc/interrupts
           CPU0       CPU1
  0:    3188815          0    IO-APIC-edge  timer
  1:      10387          0    IO-APIC-edge  i8042
  2:          0          0          XT-PIC  cascade
  9:          0          0    IO-APIC-edge  acpi
 24:      46802          0   IO-APIC-level  eth0
 27:     384890          0   IO-APIC-level  3ware Storage Controller
NMI:     903323     881935
LOC:    3188129    3188158
ERR:          0
MIS:          0
Is it normal? How can I set up some IRQ balancing (or at least hard-wire
3ware for CPU1 and eth0 for CPU0)?
Output of "dmesg" is at 
http://www.fi.muni.cz/~kas/tmp/dmesg-K8SPro.txt
Other problems are not so important or lkml-related:
Problem 2: the 3ware controller does not work correctly on the first
PCI bus (slot 1 and 2) - in slot 1 it hangs under bigger load (e.g.
an array rebuild), in slot 2 it hangs during boot in 3ware BIOS.
It is probably not Linux-specific, but has anyone seen the same problem?
Problem 3:
What the "PCI-DMA: Disabling IOMMU." message in dmesg output means?
Problem 4:
Does Linux support the hardware sensors on this board? The i2c driver
AMD8111 seems to be working, but what sensors driver should I use?
Problem 5:
Is there a 3ware configuration program (tw_cli), which works on AMD64?
	Thanks,
-Yenya
