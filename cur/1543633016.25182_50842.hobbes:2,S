I think if you had read their posts more thoroughly, or checked the patch
out yourself, you would have found that they already did this.
kbuild2.5 and kbuild2.4 are already made to exist side by side.
I dunno about the Linus-wall thing though. I think Linus has good reasons
that apply in the general case, but probably don't apply at all for this
specific case.
How do you make an exception without allowing for exceptions?
