dont be silly, next time Ulrich should also warn everyone that running 
attachments and applying patches from untrusted sources is dangerous?
any code that includes:
  fd = syscall (__NR_indirect, &r, &i, sizeof (i));
is by definition broken and unportable in every sense of the word. Apps 
will use the proper glibc interfaces (if it's exposed).
really, lets discuss _real_ issues. If you cannot think of any, please 
stay silent.
