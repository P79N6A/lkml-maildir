I think code quality priorities are:
1. Features
   If a program misses some very useful (or even vital)
   feature, there's not much sense in using it.
2. Stability
   Nobody likes when program (or server) hangs/crashes.
3. Speed
   Developers usually have fast machines with big disks,
   so they really like to see progs work fast.
4. Size
As you see, size isn't a top prio. It's sad, but we can't
have all these objectives met with same level of success.
However, Linux isn't that bad compared to Win2K nightmare.
And please let's not start a longish discussion on this. Please.
A contest to cut the most kbytes without loss of features/speed
from kernel/glibs/X/... is much more productive.  :-)
If you can't resist, may I suggest private mail, not lkml
