Attempting to provide *any* support for applications that fork children
after doing RDMA registrations is a ratshole best avoided. The general
rule that application developers should follow is to do RDMA *only*
in the child processes.
Keep in mind that it is not only the memory regions that must be dealt
with, but control data invisible to the user (the QP context, etc.). This
data frequently is interlinked between kernel residente and user resident
data (such as a QP context has the PD ID somewhere on-chip or in
kernel, which the Send Queue ring needs to be in user memory). Having
two different user processes that both think they have the user half to
this type of split data structure is just asking for trouble, even if you 
manage to get the copy on write bit timing problems all solved.
All of this can be avoided by a simple rule: don't fork after opening
an RDMA device.
