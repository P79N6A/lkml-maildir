Me also. Except for the KSTATIC spread all over the Kernel.

Even this doesn't have to be done manually. Everything that is
not covered by EXPORT_SYMBOL() in this case can be static, since
it belongs only to this subsystem and is not oficially exported
to other ones, which is a BUG if something depend on it with
CONFIG_MAKE_STATIC enabled.
Now if GCC had an option to make all symbols static by default,
which are not also declared extern...
