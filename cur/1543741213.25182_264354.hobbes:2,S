Does it cause any noticable problems? If not, then stay with
2.6.9.
However, it would be nice to get to the bottom of it. It might
just be happening by chance on 2.6.9 but not 2.6.8.1 though...
Anyway, how often are you getting the messages? How many
ethernet cards in the system?
Can you run a kernel with sysrq support, and do `SysRq+M`
(close to when the allocation failure happens if possible, but
otherwise on a normally running system after it has been up
for a while). Then send in the dmesg.
Thanks,
Nick
