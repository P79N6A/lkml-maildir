There was a long thread on the linux-virtualization list
(@lists.linux-foundation.org) just a few days ago.  The biggest single
issue right now is probably how we transition from the bootup page
tables to the "real" init_mm page tables, but the real-mode code also
needs a massive overhaul (especially so since this code can and should
be shared with x86-64); in particular I really want to get rid of the
insane segment handling, where segments are constantly recalculated for
no good reason.
For the real-mode stuff, I have some patches already in the works for
this.  Eric W. Biederman has also done a lot of work in this area.
