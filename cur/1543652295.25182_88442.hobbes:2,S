Actually I thought your "queue" was "head of queue" and that 5,6,7,8 and 9
were reads....
If the queue contains, say:
(head)	R1 R2 R3 W1 W2 W3 W4 W5 W6 W7
Then a new R4 will be inserted between W6 and W7.  So if R5 is mergeable
with R4 there is still plenty of time for that.

Really, it should be in terms of "time".  If you assume 6 msec seek and
30 mbyte/sec bandwidth, the crossover is a 120 kbyte I/O.  Not that I'm
sure this means anything interesting ;)  But the lesson is that the
size of a request isn't very important.

Yup.  This is one case where improving latency improves throughput,
if there's computational work to be done.
2.5 (and read-latency) sort-of solve these problems by creating a
massive seekstorm when there are competing reads and writes.  It's
a pretty sad solution really.
Better would be to perform those reads and writes in nice big batches.
That's easy for the writes, but for reads we need to wait for the
application to submit another one.  That means actually deliberately
leaving the disk head idle for a few milliseconds in the anticipation
that the application will submit another nearby read.  This is called
"anticipatory scheduling" and has been shown to provide 20%-70%
performance boost in web serving workloads.   It just makes heaps of
sense to me and I'd love to see it in Linux...
