That's fine - the superblock lock doesn't need to be re-entrant, because
__GFP_IO is quite sufficient for that one.
The thing I want to make re-entrant is just semaphore accesses: at the
point where we would otherwise deadlock on the writer semaphore it's much
better to just allow nested writes. I suspect all filesystems can already
handle nested writes - they are a lot easier to handle than truly
concurrent ones.
