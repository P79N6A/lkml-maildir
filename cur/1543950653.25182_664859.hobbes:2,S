ok, agreed.

the fixups are really "emergency exceptions" - for (a very low number 
of) broken boards that just cannot reboot via the default BOOT_KBD 
method. In that sense it's a small detail how widely we apply the 
exceptions - those boards probably wont be rebooted via reboot=bios 
[people only use reboot options when they have trouble rebooting].
