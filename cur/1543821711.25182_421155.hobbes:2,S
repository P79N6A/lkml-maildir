Actually, that message is useful for me. It tells me which keyboards
are crap; I have non-standard keymap (ctrl<->capslock) and some
keyboards can handle it while some other can't :-( (thinkpad x32
complains a bit). And yes, there is
problem hidden behind this message: if see this too often, your
keyboard will drop some keypresses, too (logitech keyboard with
touchpad).
