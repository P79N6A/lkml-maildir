Spooky inline assembly code, isn't it? :-)

This is to tell the C compiler which registers and variables are used,
which are clobbered by the assembly, and which are used for input or
output. I do not understand it completely (read: I only understand the
parts I needed), but you can find it in the gcc and as documentation.
Look in /usr/info on your Linux system, gcc.info* and as.info* are
the files you're looking for. Use info, tkinfo or emacs to read
info files.
Hope this helps,
Erik
