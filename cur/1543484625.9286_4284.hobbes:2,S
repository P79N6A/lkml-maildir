I reproduced the oops over a serial port and caught everything.  This time I
raised the system limit first, and things ran for over 20min under pounding
load.  I had over 9000 fds in a single threaded process.
Things go down too fast for the oops to get into syslog, but they do make it out
the serial console.
The oops happens immediately after four "TLAN: Couldn't allocate memory for
receive data." messages.  I'm going to try a system with different ethernet.
It dies again in TLan_HandleRxEOF.

Here is what happed just before the oops (vmstat was running every 5 sec):
