That wouldn't be such an effective tool for convincing people to
switch though... :-)  "Look this obsolete version is much smaller!"
If udev has really bloated up due to whizzy new features, how hard
would it be to compile a stripped-down version?  [Well I should look
at the busybox support somebody mentioned -- perhaps it's exactly
that.]
