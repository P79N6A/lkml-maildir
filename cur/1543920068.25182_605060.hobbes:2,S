Yeah, but my paper didn't really track companies very well.  The lwn.net
article is the best, and below is my version of who did things in
2.6.23.  Note, the lack of a company is not an indicator that they did
nothing, just that I could not easily determine someone worked for them.
I'll try to send out my "who are you working for" emails in a week or so
to see if I can further categorize the "unknowns".
thanks,
