It causes tons of extra work for the compiler if the compiler doesn't 
optimize away redundant header files (same header file being included from 
a lot of different sources).
I did the pruning in sparse, and I think at least gcc-3 does it too, but 
I'm not sure.
If so, then sure, we could just require that the header files compile 
cleanly, and for extra points verify that the end result is an empty 
object file (ie no bad declarations anywhere..).
