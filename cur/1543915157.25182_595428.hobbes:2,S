No, really. Xen just _implemented_ the generic interface from the
beginning, at least for 0 and 1 (version). The 0x40000002 (hypercall
page) looks specific to Xen, but it can be used for KVM as well, thus
can be generic (or a hypervisor can tell it's not supported by returning
0 pages for hypercall pages). If Xen implements the new generic feature
(defined by 0x40000003, for example), then it returns 40000003 or large
for the max leaf upon CPUID.0x40000000.

So you don't need a signature for that. 
As I wrote before:
1. detect Xen or KVM <the list> using CPUID.0x40000000 
2. Check the version if necessary using CPUID.0x40000001
3. Check the generic features available using CPUID.0x4000000Y, if the
max leaf returned >= 0x4000000Y.
A guest wants to want to know who the hypervior is for practical
purposes (e.g. debuggging) anyway. This is equivalent to what a native
OS would do to detect a generic CPU feature.
