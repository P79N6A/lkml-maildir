I don't believe your statement is correct that OEM drives and retail drives
always differ.  They may have slight configuration differences, but
fundamentally I think they're the same drive with identical or
near-identical firmware.

As an optional feature on any drive?  Not sure, it would be nice.  However,
maintaining it specifically for individual drives in a product line might be
more work than someone high up feels is worth it.  Maybe there's a market
for buying a $30 warranty add-on from Maxtor that buys you an extra year or
whatever, however, I think you can get the same thing from CompUSA or other
companies now if you want it.  For them it is profitable, and I don't think
we'd want to compete with our virtual sales force. (The retail shops)
I do know you get better warranties on the more expensive models though, but
obviously that doesn't help after-the-fact.
