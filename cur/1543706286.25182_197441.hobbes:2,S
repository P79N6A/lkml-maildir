So host recognizes 80-wires cable correctly, but drive doesn't.
eighty_ninty_three() is for checking _drive_ side.

This is eighty_ninty_three() in 2.6.x (except #if 0 (...) #endif code):
u8 eighty_ninty_three (ide_drive_t *drive)
{
	return ((u8) ((HWIF(drive)->udma_four) &&
#ifndef CONFIG_IDEDMA_IVB
			(drive->id->hw_config & 0x4000) &&
#endif /* CONFIG_IDEDMA_IVB */
			(drive->id->hw_config & 0x6000)) ? 1 : 0);
#endif
}
Maybe you have accidentally enabled CONFIG_IDEDMA_IVB?
If not please send me copy of /proc/ide/hdX/identify for your drives.
