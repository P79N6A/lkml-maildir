Can you try the attached patch? Here's a sample OCFS2 lock name:
M0000000000000000036cc0458354c5
So as you can see, things at the beginning of the name are very regular -
something that I don't think full_name_hash() is handling very well. I
hacked a (barely) new hash function to avoid the first 7 bytes and it
reliably saves me 2 seconds in real time on my untars. I think we can
actually make it much better (this is still pretty dumb) than that, but I'm
just curious as to how much it helps on your tests.
