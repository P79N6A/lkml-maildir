I'm writing a little driver and I need to run a thread to poll data.
I've googled a bit to find an example, but I only found this
http://www.scs.ch/~frey/linux/kernelthreads.html
but it is for 2.4, while I need it for 2.6
Do you know any example and/or tutorial for kernel threads?
Thank you.
PS: can you please CC me because I didn't subscribe the list?
