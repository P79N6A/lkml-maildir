I am also working on a NAPI version of the pcnet32 driver for many of
the same reasons, and will compare what you have with my own
implementation.  I probably won't be able to do much until Friday.  
Just a couple of comments.  I am adding netdev@vger.kernel.org to the cc
list, as most network driver discussion is done here rather than lkml.
linux-kernel (and linux-net) should be deleted in future replies.
The 2.6.17-rc6 would be the correct source to patch against.  Since this
is an enhancement it will not come out till 2.6.18.
I would not change the driver name from pcnet32 to pcnet32napi, but I
would changes the version from 1.32 to 1.33NAPI or something like that.
Some areas of concern that you may have addressed already, I have not
scanned your changes yet, are what happens if the ring size is changed
without bringing down the interface (via ethtool), or if the loopback
test is run in a similar fashion, or a tx timeout occurs.
The lp->lock MUST be held whenever accessing the csr or bcr registers as
this is a multi-step process, and has been the source of problems in the
past.  Even on UP systems.
