I'm not sure about this.  It's trivial to find the version of a running
kernel and from that you can deduce anything that *isn't* set in .config,
and the space savings are substantial.

This might be a reasonable thing to do since the way LZ compression is
implemented, killing a redundant string doesn't have that much effect.  For
jollies:
-rw-r--r--   1 griffon  root         6960 Jan 15 08:19 config
-rw-r--r--   1 griffon  root         2052 Jan 15 08:19 config.gz
-rw-r--r--   1 griffon  root         1982 Jan 15 08:25 config.hack.gz
-rw-r--r--   1 griffon  root          777 Jan 15 08:22 config.strip.gz
-rw-r--r--   1 griffon  root          731 Jan 15 08:23 config.strip.hack.gz
config is the original file.  config.gz is it compresses with gzip -9.
config.hack.gz is it compressed after being run through sed -e s/CONFIG_//.
config.strip.gz is the compresses product after running it through 
egrep -v '(^#|^$)', and config.strip.hack.gz is the compressed product after
both the sed and egrep.  46 bytes doesn't seem to me to be all that
important a savings.  (This might even get lost in alignment fuzz or
something, I don't know)  I would tend to vote for the "egrep" approach
without the "sed" approach.
Other caveats:
o The script makes use of an easily guessable name in /tmp.  Unless the
author wants to be flamed on bugtraq, he should probably change it.
o I know the overall tendency is to make files in /proc not human-readable
but it seems like even in 2.2 we're going to have /proc/* still be.  A
gzipped file definitely isn't so it should probably be moved deeped into the
hierarchy.  /proc/sys/kernel/config.gz maybe?  (Unless you want to gunzip on
the fly that is, which is probably not a good idea.)
