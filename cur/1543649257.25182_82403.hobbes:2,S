I support merge, Linus seemed to support it with the caveat that he said 
he didn't personally see much discussion...

No comment other than I notice tytso's patches got dropped (at least 
once/twice?).  Maybe viro hasn't reviewed them?
IIRC viro had some objections to ACLs in general and how they might not 
necessarily actually improve security -- but I did not see detailed 
elaboration on this.

I dunno if this needs to be in the kernel...

Needs sysfs support or devmapperfs support... no need to add a bunch of 
ioctls that will go away eventually.

Rob - this URL doesn't seen to have anything directly to do with large 
page support.
Others-
Is this not already in the kernel?  I still want to actually see someone 
from Oracle actually say "I will use this" or "we find this useful".

IMO 2.7.x item...

why does this need to be the mainline kernel?  this is another type of 
thing that can live as a patch, IMO...

this is already merged, isn't it??

no comment, I've heard arguments that high-res timers would be useful, 
but haven't read the patch myself so won't comment...

Sounds like 2.7.x material, viro pointed out several problems ...

I would personally _love_ to see this merged, but I think it's 2.7.x 
material given the recent comments (unless they get fixed up)

needs more review... but hasn't some of this stuff already made it in?
(or am I thinking about fbdev...?)

Useful, but at the same time not many people will use this I think.  It 
may need to live as a patch for a while, if not for a long while...

The USAGI guys have been slowly splitting up their patches and 
submitting them... AFAIK DaveM is just waiting on more split-up IPv6 
patches from them...

at first glance this seems to have serious issues with being a black 
hole for overriding syscalls-type behavior...

I dunno if people want to take the hit in the mainline kernel... Maybe 
this should be a CONFIG_xxx option, or live outside as a patch that 
enterprise customers integrate
