I think you still have the change_page_attr() bug that I so far
didn't manage to fix on x86-64 properly neither (I had one patch, but 
it caused mysterious other failures). Currently x86-64 has a nasty 
partly broken workaround for this only that can cause illegal aliases.
The bug is when change_page_attr() splits a kernel text page
and reverts it back then the NX bit gets set on the kernel
text page. This happens when AGP allocates a page that lies 
within 2MB of the kernel mapping.
