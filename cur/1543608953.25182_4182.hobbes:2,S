Subject: Network driver for SiS 735 available?

I have a new Elitegroup K7S5A with the integrated SiS 735 chip.
The stock 2.4.14 kernel does recognize the network chip.  From looking at
the mainboard, it also correctly recognizes the "Realtek RTL8201 PHY".
It even outputs the right messages (i.e.: No Media, Full duplex 100MBit,
Half duplex 10MBit, ...) when I plug the cable into our switch or hub, but
never transmits nor receives any packets.
Any suggestions what I could try/how I could debug the driver?
Nils
