GPL itself does not. But the author(s) may when they specify "any
later version", "dual GPL/BSD", etc. In this case (IMHO) distributor
in fact relicenses the code and may reduce license to sipmply BSD or
simply GPL, or "GPL v3 from now on". To "restore" license you would
need to go upstream and get the code from there.
