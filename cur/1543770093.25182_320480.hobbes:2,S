Excuse me? 1 second (1000 usecs, 200 times your 50 usec example) is 
VERY noticeable when you are listening to music, or worse yet, trying 
to edit it.  For much of that, submillisecond accuracy makes or 
breaks the application.
Lets get out of the server only camp here folks, linux is used for a 
hell of a lot more than a home for apache.
