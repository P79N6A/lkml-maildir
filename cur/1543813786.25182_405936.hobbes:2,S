Well, the whole collection of Quirks isn't based on a device-type
model, but purely on IDs. So either there's a workaround for some
oddity, or there isn't.
Though it may make sense to re-submit if right after 2.6.16 is out.

That depends on wether the soundchip is inside the chipset. If it is,
you can just ignore that and run the quirk if the proper device was
found (as you do it right now.)  If you really need to verify the
mainboard (as per name/vendor), have a look at
./arch/i386/kernel/{reboot,apm}.c .  They both are DMI users.
