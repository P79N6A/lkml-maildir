I don't think it would affect that behavior, but surprises can happen;
like the root cause of 5496 being the lack of hookup to the real device.

First, whether it ever worked on ports enumerated through PNP.
After all, I saw it oops there, ergo the surprisingly-far-afield
parts of this patch to update PNP so it now sets up DMA masks.
(Which, I was thinking, probably matters mostly for parport;
but I'm just assuming 24-bit masks are correct there.)

Suggesting that no, it's never worked on ports enumerated
through PNP.  There's a possibility that if it previously
worked through PCI, it now works ... someone with a parport
printer could check it out.
