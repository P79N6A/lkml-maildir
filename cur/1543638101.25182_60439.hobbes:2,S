Subject: odd tmpfs behaviour
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Just a quick question, to see if anyone has run into this problem
before: I'm using tmpfs mounted with default options on to /tmp. 
I hadn't noticed this before, but my config.status scripts (for any sw
package; stunnel-3.22 is my current example here) now loop endlessly
because, apparently, the files in /tmp/cs*/ don't change when written to
in a very short while loop. 
As a short test, I compared using /tmp which is tmpfs to /var/tmp, which
is reiserfs, and the difference shows: in /tmp, I get an infinite loop;
in /var/tmp, 4 iterations. Anybody seen this?
I can attach a strace file if it will help somebody; let me know.
Take care,
