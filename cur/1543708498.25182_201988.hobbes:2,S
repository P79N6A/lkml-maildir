That's what I assume(d), too.

That's true and interesting, as I did a shutdown -o (poweroff) from minit, which
should have unmounted the partions. I'll retry this with -h (halt only)
this evening.

Will reboot in half an hour, but I think as the recovery was done, it
won't have any problems anymore.
There are still some questions open for me:
1. why is it an internal xfs error?
2. why does it print a call trace?
3. how can I find out what's wrong / what should I do when seeing call
   traces? And what should I've done before (adding debugging somewhere?)
Have a nice night,
Nico
