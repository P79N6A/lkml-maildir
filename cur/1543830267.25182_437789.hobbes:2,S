Their locations have been carefully audited and understood.  The original
issue here was IRIX being able to do a very good of preventing kernel
memory allocation failures, which I suspect caused the original XFS guys
to be fairly relaxed in their handling of memory allocation failures.
Its caused us no end of pain with the Linux port, I assure you.
But, I digress.  If Christoph says you have a problem, you probably do;
he really is not biased XFS's way - he's driven us to make many changes
leading up to our major merge points too, and he will happily point out
crappy code in XFS as well. ;-)
cheers.
