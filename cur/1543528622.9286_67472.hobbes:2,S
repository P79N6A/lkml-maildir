No. My point is that while *some* people will be aware that their
threaded programme run on DSM will have to be re-coded to avoid lots
of lock movement, *most* authors of threaded programmes will be
unaware of this. DSM discourages people from thinking.

Why buy a 200 node cluster when you can get the same performance with
a 20 CPU SMP box?

Message passing can't be slower. Even with your automatic DMA
registers (from the private email you sent), the message passing call
can simply do a memcpy to the DMA memory area.

Very nice. What's the latency, though? Can you ship a lock in << 100
ns? Is there a penalty for doing two back-to-back? If you write, is
the data broadcast to all CPUs/local memory pools? Is the MESI cache
protocol supported?

I'm not saying that DSM cannot ever be a useful thing. I'm sure that
there will be some applications that will scale fairly well, so you
could say that the reduction in brain power is worth the small
performance loss.
What I am saying is that the vast majority of people who jump up and
down saying that DSM will be great for their threaded application are
wrong. If they think their performance won't suck, it's more likely
than not that they haven't thought hard enough about it. The problem
is not that DSM will kill performance in the rest of the kernel (I'm
assuming it won't, otherwise it would never get past Linus, and would
be howled down by me, Larry and plenty of others, I'm sure). The
problem is that DSM is too seductive and easy to use, *when it's
almost certain it shouldn't be used*.
DSM should have a huge red health warning label telling people that
they really don't want it. If it goes into the kernel, it should ask
you 5 times if you really want to do this, and it should be
interactive every time you rebuild (none of this set once in a .config
file and forget about it). And it should randomly not compile 50% of
the time, requiring you to delete your kernel tree and unpack it
again.
