If host B won't propagate back, then host C should not trust host B.
Host C is misconfigured.

You only have to consider direct interactions, giving O(n) combinations
instead of O(n*n) combinations. Commonly one interaction is a pty, and
the other interaction is a network socket with a well-defined protocol.
You can establish the credentials of the process on the other side of
one of these connections. Either you trust or you don't.

No problem. Configure sshd on host C to limit the security level
that it is willing to propagate back to host B.

This is going beyond paranoid, and I think you have a "hole" even
without security level propagation across a distant login.
Spies just do this:
1. move secret data from C to B
2. move secret data from B to A
There, done. Secret data from C is now on A, even though C does not
trust A at that level.

The covert channel is one of many. You only need to ensure that
the bandwidth is documented and/or below 300 bits/second, depending
on what kind of security you intend to have. Cut the time stamp
resolution, add some random delays, and limit connections/second.

OK, so we implement the extended security packet.
One may also rely on the trusted software that inplements the
protocol. Remember that ssh and sshd are both trusted, and that
they can use an encryption algorithm that you trust to secure
all of your data. You can have a multi-level tunnel through
a single-level TCP/IP connection. You can even generate dummy
traffic to defeat traffic analysis.

Yes, but this is not really a problem.
If you somehow manage to make a trusted-script program, then it will
work as it should. (generating files with the right level)
If your "script" program is not trusted, then you can't change your
security level through it. This will most likely be the case, since
one would want to avoid trusting damn near everything.

You should not trust buggy software. You get what you deserve
when you trust buggy software.

I don't know, but trusted-script will take care of it. Maybe you'd
get a multi-level directory containing multiple files with the
same name, one for each level.

This is all just more of the same. The problem is solved. You can
apply the solution to any example, no matter how complex you make it.
First of all, putting passwords in a file is already a major policy
violation that no system can prevent.
When the setuserlevel command happens, sshd will try to propagate
changes back across to the ssh. No problem, I already explained this.
Now ssh and/or the kernel will notice the redirection. Since it is
most likely not possible to propagate level changes across a normal
dumb pipe, ssh will report failure back to the sshd.
Well, that was easy. One could attempt to propagate across the dumb
pipes with proper kernel assistance for out-of-band security messaging.
This will certainly fail, because nobody sane would try to implement
a trusted awk. Not that you couldn't though...

The more you trust, the more you can do. Trust is risky.
There is a trade-off to be made here. What else is new? :-)
You make your choice about what you trust and you reap the
benefits or suffer the consequences.
