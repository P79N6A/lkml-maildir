Hi all,
	I am using kernel 2.2.14-5.0smp. I keep getting " Connection
refused" on repeated 'sendto' calls.
	Am I correct in saying that the only reason for this error is
'non-availability of ports'. I have tested for data being sent to
non-listening ports, but cannot reproduce the error. Any help would be
greatly appreciated.
						sincerely,
						Ciju
