You'd have to write extra feature_off callback functions, though
(or change the existing ones, as I did), since currently no callback
function allows to reset a value once it was called. They are all
coded like this:
static __init int apm_is_horked(struct dmi_blacklist *d)
{
	if (apm_info.disabled == 0)
	
		apm_info.disabled = 1;
		printk(KERN_INFO "%s machine detected. Disabling APM.\n", d->ident);
	
	return 0;
}
What I was looking for was a solution which allows resetting values
simply by changing the dmi_blacklist.
One can of course argue that we can always add apm_is_not_horked_after_all()
should the need ever arise.
