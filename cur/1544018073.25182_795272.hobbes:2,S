Are you sure? Ie. sysrq+D a still works properly? In that case, you
wouldn't need the lockdep patch because it just prevents the feature from being
switched off.
I'll have to dig a bit further, then. The annoying thing is that
lockdep turns itself off at the drop of a hat (and this particular
problem seems to happen without any backtraces), so it invalidates
all your lockdep testing if you don't realise it has turned itself
off.
Is there a way to re-arm lockdep? That would be neat.
