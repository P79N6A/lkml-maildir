NAK.  You're missing the point.  If an attempt is made to free a
reserved page, it implies that the page reference counting has
gone wrong: we want to hear about that (so call bad_page),
and we dare not reuse the page (so skip freeing it).
What might be a good change, is to avoid freeing a page which meets
_any_ of the criteria for calling bad_page: I often wonder whether
to do that, alongside abandoning that hopeless page_mapcount BUG in
page_remove_rmap, which has almost(?) never helped lead us to any fix.
