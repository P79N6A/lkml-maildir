Subject: [PATCHSET] m68k: build fixes and sparse annotations
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/12/21/338

Patch series against the mainline; most of it directly applies to m68k CVS,
except for #18 (dmasound_paula lvalues abuse) that is pulled from CVS and
#4 (misc/mac.c switch away from adb_request()) - that one does apply to CVS
but assumes that ADBREQ_RAW patch (present in CVS, but absent in mainline)
is reverted.
All patches affect only m68k or (in one patch) ppc/amiga; the latter is
a trivial renaming of a macro from amigahw.h.  IOW, it should be mergable
at any point without any impact on other architectures.  And in the
current mainline m68k still doesn't build...
Patches follow.  Please, review.
