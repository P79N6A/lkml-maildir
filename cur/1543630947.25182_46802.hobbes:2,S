No.

I don't mind the SIGSEGV, but I refuse to make a stupid change that has
absolutely _zero_ reason for it.
The current "copy_to/from_user()" is perfectly fine. It's very simple to
do
	if (copy_from_user(xxx))
		return -EFAULT;
and it is not AT ALL simpler to do
	ret = copy_from_user(xxx);
	if (ret)
		return ret;
which is apparently your suggestion.
So a lot of people didn't get it? Arnaldo seems to have fixed a lot of
them already, and maybe you who apparently care can add _documentation_,
but the fact is that there is no reason to make a less powerful interface.
