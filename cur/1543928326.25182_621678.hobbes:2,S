When writing big files on 2.6.24-rc3-mm1, there can be substiantial
number of leaked requests (CONFIG_DEBUG_SLAB_LEAK enabled):
# cat /proc/slab_allocators |grep do_ubd_request
size-128: 25687 do_ubd_request+0xe0/0x19d
There seems to be no corruption though.  Looking at the code, I can't
see how the requests could leak...
