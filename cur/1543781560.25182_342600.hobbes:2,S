Doing it for sata as well is just a little more work. The generic code
is the same, but you probably need to add a per-queue hook for filling
the request with the proper command setup. For ide that would be a
REQ_DRIVE_TASKFILE, for libata you need to look at the pass through
stuff. Everything else still applies.
