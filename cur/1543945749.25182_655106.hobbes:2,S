Yes, the logs of creating the tree.

Um, well, I've already pointed to tools that currently do this bit
automatically.  Do you have a list of input trees anywhere?

Oh, OK ... by build I mean combine the trees and quilts into the actual
tree.  Compiling is nice, but it's the tree construction logs I want to
see to make sure there aren't any impending merge problems.  Most people
verify on a fairly constant basis that their own trees actually build.
The only problems we have are edge configurations (like arm and sparc,
which have SCSI drivers that don't build except on those architectures).
