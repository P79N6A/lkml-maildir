Well... I refer you to my change long, where I indeed admitted directly
that it's an ugly band aid ;-).

Right. it belongs one level up. The request handling should
possible learn whatever it it's handling ATA or ATAPI devices.
In esp. the ide_start_dma() changes where no pretty...

Fortunately it can't happen becouse the other devices don't
support TCQ.

Ohhh. there are a lot of other things I'm unhappy about there as well.

Yes this was my intention for the future. The only driver which will have
problems with this is ide-scsi.c - it's not obvious (at least right now)
to me how to change the do_request signature there.

You notice that I didn't even care to change the write request code-path?
BTW.> It became obvious to me as well that even all the drivers out
there not supporting TCQ will have to get the TCQ parts of struct ata_device
initialized - with a trivial queue depth. drive->tcq should therefore be really
just a memmber of struct ata_device()..
