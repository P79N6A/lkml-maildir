Hi,
I have a 2940UW adapter with one wide seagate drive on it. It has been
working very well for me for a while now. I have not had any scsi errors
for many moons. But, when moving 300-400 MB of files over nfs today I got
these...

I have run many benchmarks on the drive with bonnie, lmbench and hdparm
and never had any errors. The errors only seem to appear when doing
lengthy operations over nfs. Smaller nfs operations seem to be fine, also
copying files from box B to box A(see below) is also fine(box A to box B
is the problem). Could someone tell me what these error codes mean? (or
how I can decipher them)
The two machines are both running linux:
Box A	mixed scsi and ide
	kernel 2.2.11-ac1 + tcp patches
	nfs client
	RedHat 6.0 i386
	TCQ is on by default and commands/device is set to 32
	The seagate drive is SCA with a converter to HD68 pin
	(I would not be at all surprised if this converter is to blame, I
	just can't bring myself to spend any more money on scsi cableage.)
Box B	ide only
	kernel 2.2.12 vanilla
	nfs server
	RedHat 5.1 + many updates i386
	no errors in logs here
