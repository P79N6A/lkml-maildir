The maintain-bio-ordering patch mostly fixes the performance problem
I was seeing on XFS-over-LVM-on-3ware-raid5. (See my earlier message
at 
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0312.3/0684.html
 )
Excellent!
However there's still one issue:
I created a LVM volume on /dev/sda2, called /dev/vg0/test. Then
I created and mounted an XFS partition on /dev/vg0/test. XFS uses
a 512 byte blocksize by default, but the underlying /dev/sda2
device had a soft blocksize of 4096 (default after boot is 1024,
but I had been mucking around with it so it got set to 4096).
As a result, I couldn't get more than 35 MB/sec write speed out
of XFS mounted on the LVM device.
I added this little patch:

        else {
                d->bdev = bdev;
-               set_blocksize(bdev, d->bdev->bd_block_size);
+               set_blocksize(bdev, 512);
        }
        return r;
 }
This forces the underlying device(s) to a soft blocksize of 512. And
I had my 80 MB/sec write speed back !
I'm not sure if setting the blocksize of the underlying device
always to 512 is the right solution. I think that set_blocksize
for dm devices should also set the size for the underlying devices,
but that probably means adding an extra hook so that
set_blocksize can call bdev->bd_disk->fops->set_blocksize(bdev, size).
Which, in the case of dm, would basically call set_blocksize for the
underlying devices again.
Correct ?
Mike.
