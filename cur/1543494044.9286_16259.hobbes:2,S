Subject: kernel 2.2.6 Oops
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

[1.] One line summary of the problem:
Kernel 2.2.6 hanged after generating an oops. alt-sysrq did not work
[2.] Full description of the problem/report:
System is a web,mail (free web based email service) running apache 1.3.4,
sendmail 8.9.3. I do not think this is a hardware problem becouse with
kernel 2.0.3x there were no such problems. kernel is standard 2.2.6 with
RAID support. I've experienced lockups with 2.2.5-ac3, 2.2.5 but I was
unable to get the oops log. With older kernel versions the uptime was no more
than one day, after that there were an increasing number of processes stuck
in D state, then lockup.
[3.] Keywords (i.e., modules, networking, kernel):
kernel
[4.] Kernel version (from /proc/version):
Linux version 2.2.6 (root@zerg.codec.ro) (gcc version 2.7.2.3)
#16 Thu Apr 22 12:51:22 EEST 1999
[5.] Output of Oops.. message (if applicable) with symbolic information
     resolved (see Documentation/oops-tracing.txt)
oops is attached compressed becouse is rather big. symbolic info was
resolved by syslog.
[6.] A small shell script or example program which triggers the
     problem (if possible)

[7.4.] SCSI information (from /proc/scsi/scsi)
-
[7.5.] Other information that might be relevant to the problem
       (please look in /proc and include all information that you
       think to be relevant):
the server runs sendmail with an alias list of about 25000 users which
is ocasionally rebuilt (when there is a new user created). the rebuilding
of this list is slow and often a newaliases command take a couple of 
minutes but sometimes it is stuck waiting to lock the aliases file.
if such hanged newaliases are killed then sometimes the kernel hangs.
now the oops seem to me to be the result of:
iput: Aieee, semaphore in use inode 00:00/118969, count=0
one previous oops seemed to be the reult of something like:
Free list corrupted
[X.] Other notes, patches, fixes, workarounds:
