  The gains from this might be largely illusion but you could get some
theoretical benefits:
  o could write out lots of pages to swap without having to flush TLBs
    like you would if doing normal swap, since page remains present
  o if swsusp does not need to write already-backed pages it could
    reduce suspend time
  Maybe something like this?
   if about_to_spin_down_disks || swap_disk_idle
       if lots_of_memory_free
           page_in
       if little_memory_free
           copy_pages_to_swap
