  It depends on many things:
   - Block layer (unsigned long)
   - Page indexes (unsigned long)
   - Filesystem format dependent limits
      - EXT2/EXT3: u32_t FILESYSTEM block index, presuming the EXT2/EXT3
                   is supported only up to 4 kB block sizes, that gives
                   you a very hard limit.. of 16 terabytes (16 * "10^12")
      - ReiserFS:  u32_t block indexes presently, u64_t in future;
                   block size ranges ?   Max size is limited by the
                   maximum supported file size, likely 2^63, which is
                   roughly  8 * "10^18", or circa 500 000 times larger
                   than EXT2/EXT3 format maximum.
      - ClusterFS: (Braam et.al.): 64 bit block indexes ?
                   System file size limitation, same as with ReiserFS.
      (Just to illustriate a few..)
