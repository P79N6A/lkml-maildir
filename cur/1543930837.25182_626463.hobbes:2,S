That's kind of what I feared you would say =)

I don't feel very well with removing code from the driver that iSER seems 
to depend on. Are there plans to fix this in iSER?
In reality, PHYP rarely ever returns H_LONG_BUSY, and we haven't had any 
problems with iSER in the field yet. I admit that our FMR code is 
dangerous, but I prefer "dangerous but working for the customer" over "not 
working for the customer at all".
Maybe we can agree on keeping the status quo until no more ULPs depend on 
FMR, then remove FMR from ehca? If so, we'd also let the _irqsave 
spinlocks around hCalls stay in place.
