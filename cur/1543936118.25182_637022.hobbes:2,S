Maybe to state it more clearly, the issue is that in order to be atomic,
the writer must atomically access the clock, and make all the updates in
one step.
So if a reader accesses the clock after the writer accesses the clock,
but before the writer finishes the update, there is the possibility time
could go backwards.
Now, not to completely throw water on it, It is possible to set up a
bounds argument, and say as long as NTP adjustments are less then X, and
the window between the writer starting and finishing the update is less
then Y, the resulting inconsistency is limited to Z. And if Z is less
then a nanosecond, then you're ok.
However, items like virtualization and the realtime patch can cause Y to
be stretched quite a bit, so finding a way to handle that would be
needed as well.
