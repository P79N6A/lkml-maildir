FYI, network activity only generates entropy on a very small subset of
NICs, and probably not the one you're using. This is good, as network
activity is assumed passively observable/timable.

Are you and Patrice both experiencing this on the same machine? What
was the last kernel that was known to work for you? Do you see the
contents of /proc/sys/kernel/random/entropy_avail change over time?
Are there any other entropy consumers on your machine?
