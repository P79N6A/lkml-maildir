In function __alloc_skb, original parameter size=4155,
SKB_DATA_ALIGN(size)=4224, sizeof(struct skb_shared_info)=472, so
__kmalloc_track_caller's parameter size=4696.

This patch amost fixes the netperf UDP-U-4k issue.
#slabinfo -AD
Name                   Objects    Alloc     Free   %Fast
:0000256                  1658 70350463 70348946  99  99 
kmalloc-8192                31 70322309 70322293  99  99 
:0000168                  2592   143154   140684  93  28 
:0004096                  1456    91072    89644  99  96 
:0000192                  3402    63838    60491  89  11 
:0000064                  6177    49635    43743  98  77 
So ﻿kmalloc-8192 appears. Without the patch, ﻿kmalloc-8192 hides.
﻿kmalloc-8192's default order on my 8-core stoakley is 2.
1) If I start CPU_NUM clients and servers, SLUB's result is about 2% better than SLQB's;
2) If I start 1 clinet and 1 server, and bind them to different physical cpu, SLQB's result
is about 10% better than SLUB's.
I don't know why there is still 10% difference with item 2). Maybe cachemiss causes it?
