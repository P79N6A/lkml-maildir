The call to open() does not fail - with only a write_urb associated with it,
it's not a very interesting port, but data can be written to it, at least in
small quantities (see below).  The first patch that I submitted had a bug
(which I've fixed) in it 
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-usb-devel&m=108515267617337&w=2
that Pete Zaitcev pointed out in visor_open() that might be confusing the 
issue.
The behavior that I intended was to allow devices that have more bulk out
endpoints than bulk in endpoints (namely treos) to still use the write only
port.  Mainly though, it was to allow for swapping endpoints to allow for
the uneven number of in and out endpoints.  This was not a problem prior to
now since the endpoints were being copied instead of swapped.

I bet someone really smart will figure it out - it probably just melts the ROM,
or something else useful :-)
One more question - my system does not really like it when I redirect /dev/urandom
to either the first or second port.  I know that it obviosuly makes no sense to
do such a thing, but is it expected that there should be no problems associated
with this.  I'm not finished testing, so I'm not sure how severe a problem develops.
I'll report in when I know more about this.
