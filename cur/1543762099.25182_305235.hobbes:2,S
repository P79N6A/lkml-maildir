Hi guys,
i'm trying to find somethin in the kernel tree and i can't :(
I want to know, where are the input devices (say mice and keyb) are
initialized. Where does the kernel search the bus for this devices?
basically, what does he do to print this messages:
input: AT Translated Set 2 keyboard on isa0060/serio0
input: SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad on isa0060/serio1
i'm just trying to track down what i think it's a problem.
Thanks,
Carlos Silva
