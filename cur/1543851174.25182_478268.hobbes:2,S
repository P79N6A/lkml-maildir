The same PCI ID maps to either RAID or AHCI.  The PCI ID only changes 
when it's no longer in AHCI mode (IDE/legacy mode).
To confuse matters even further, sometimes you can use AHCI even though 
it claims it is in IDE mode.  And the reverse is -often- true:  you can 
usually use legacy IDE mode even if the PCI ID and class code claim AHCI 
mode.
Who knows what beasts lurk behind the same PCI ID...

Heck these days 'RAID' is a marketing requirement for your hardware, 
regardless of its capabilities...
