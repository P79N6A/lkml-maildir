Ahh, that's not "current kernel", though ;)

Drivers should be able to assume that wmb() orders _everything_ (except
some whacky Altix thing, which I really want to fold under wmb at some
point anyway).
So I decided that old x86 semantics isn't right, and now it really is a
lock op / sfence everywhere.
