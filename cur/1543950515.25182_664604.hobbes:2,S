My bad. I overlooked the fact that exception handling by the processor
automatically disables interrupts and my tested configs didn't have
CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK_SLEEP set. My previous fix took care of only 32bit kernels
as they were disabling interrupts explicitly for PREEMPT kernels.
I will post a -v5 fixing this.

BTW, In the .config you sent, you don't have CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK_SLEEP or
CONFIG_DEBUG_KERNEL set. How come you are seeing those backtraces?
