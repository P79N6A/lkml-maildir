No.  kpiod has absolutely no impact at all unless you have lots of
writable memory mapped files.

This is an old problem and has been around since 2.2.0.  It concerns
writing to the buffer cache, not kpiod.  You _will_ be able to reproduce
this on 2.2.1 or 2.2.0-ac2 if you recreate identical running conditions.
We have fixes under testing... watch this space.
