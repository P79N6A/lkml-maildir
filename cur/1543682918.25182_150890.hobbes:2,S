GCC 3.3 and later do this automatically.
It's weird, since we killed TONS of explicit zero initializers during
2.5.x, you'd be pressed to find many examples like the one you
mention.
Another thing is that the define_per_cpu() stuff eliminated many huge
[NR_CPUS] arrays.  But this probably doesn't apply to his kernel
unless he built is with SMP enabled.
