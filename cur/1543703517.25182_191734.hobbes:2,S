Hi Greg, could this be added to device.h:

I'm using it as the following (inspired by find_bus), and it seems like 
it would make sense to put in device.h.
struct vio_dev *vio_find_device(const char *name)
{
	struct kobject *kobj;
	kobj = kset_find_obj(&vio_bus_type.devices, name);
	if (!kobj)
		return NULL;
	return to_vio_dev(kobj_to_dev(kobj));
}
As a side node, since those #defines don't to type-checking, would it 
make sense to name them with both types? E.g. "kobj_to_dev" instead of 
just "to_dev"?
