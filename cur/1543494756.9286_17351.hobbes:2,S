Subject: 2.2.x fails to boot on SPARC 2 (scsi problems)

I have a SPARCstation 2 and I have been unable to get 2.2.x to boot on
it.  I've tried both 2.2.1 and 2.2.7 with the same problem:
esp0: IRQ 3 SCSI ID 7 Clk 20 MHz CCF=4 TOut 167 NCR53C90A (esp100a)
ESP: Total of 1 ESP hosts found, 1 actually in use
scsi0: Sparc ESP100A (NCR53C90A)
scsi: 1 host
esp0: Warning, live target 0 not responding to selection
This last message repeats ad nauseum and the kernel never gets past
that point.
Here's what happens after the "scsi: 1 host" message under 2.0.35:
Detected scsi disk sda at scsi0, channel 0, id 3, lun 0
scsi: detected 1 SCSI disk total
esp0: Disabling DISCONNECT for target 3 lun 0
esp0: target 3 [period 208ns offset 15 4.80 MHz synchronous SCSI]
The kernel then boots successfully.
So, why does 2.2.x get hung up on probing target 0 when target 0
doesn't even exist?  And what is different about the SCSI setup in
2.0.35 that lets it get past that point?  I would REALLY like to fix
this problem.  Please cc all replies to me directly.
Thanks,
    Max
