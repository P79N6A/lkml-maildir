Yes, but that driver was soundly rejected by the network driver
maintainers, so I wouldn't go around showing that as your primary
example of how to use this interface :)
The point is valid, I don't think these apis should go into the tree
without a driver or some other code using them.  Otherwise they make no
sense at all to have in-tree.
