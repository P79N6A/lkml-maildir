OK, will do that.

Indeed since libiscsi does not have a CONFIG_ of its own, you need to
set CONFIG_ISCSI_TCP to have libiscsi being built and then iser links
with it.
So there are two options here: either to set a CONFIG_LIBISCSI and
select it by both CONFIG_ISCSI_TCP and CONFIG_INFINIBAND_ISER or the
approach you were suggesting. I am cc-ing Mike Christie and James
Bottomley on this email, if you guys have a preference, let me know
and i can produce a patch to drivers/scsi/Kconfig and Makefile.

What's little wrong here is that hdr->itt is __be32 but it never gets
htonl-ed before placing on the wire so i can't ntohl it back before
AND-ing it with the ITT_MASK. Its only little wrong b/c in a way the
target treats the ITT (Initiator Task Tag) as an opaque tag and hence
it just returns on the command/control response the itt of the
command/control.
At the bottom line, its need to be fixed by converting the itt to
network order in libiscsi and then converting it to host order in iser
before doing the arthimetic AND, so the sparse endianess related
warning will be gone. I  will be able to fix that on Sunday and send
the fixes to linux-scsi and openib.

Thanks to you for pointing these issues, also, in drivers/infiniband/Makefile

Or.
