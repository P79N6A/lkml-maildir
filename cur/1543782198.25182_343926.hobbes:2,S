latency
n 
1: (computer science) the time it takes for a specific block of data on
a data track to rotate around to the read/write head [syn: rotational
latency] 
2: the time that elapses between a stimulus and the response to it [syn:
reaction time, response time, latent period] 
3: the state of being not yet evident or active
No apparent references to "unexplained" in association with the word
latency.
