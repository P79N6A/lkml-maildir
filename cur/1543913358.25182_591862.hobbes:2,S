This is a GCC bug (regression, actually, as you've found out) -- no two
ways about it. Although different from the kind Jeff mentioned couple days
back -- that was about wising GCC up to false positives and /not/ emitting
warnings. But here a genuine problem was not complained about, so this is
more serious. Do you plan to open up a bug at gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/ ?
