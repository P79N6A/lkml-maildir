Hi again Russel,
I'm back, after some more testing. Here goes my report.
I've switched to another SBC and the kernel still Oops, so is not a
one-off fault on the hardware.
I've also run memtest86+ on this board for the maximum period that I
reach an Oops with my application (24 H) and it not detected any fault
(in 21 passes).
As I've said earlier, our hardware as an extra serial controller
(TL16C554A). To isolate the problem, I've removed the board with this
extra controller and used only the SBC (Vortex86-6070 -
http://www.icop.com.tw/products_detail.asp?ProductID=70
). Still, with
that setup and with my application using only ttyS1, I get kernel Oops,
and always in the same point:

I've also done your suggestion and I've inserted "msleep(10);" just
before the "And clear the interrupt registers again for luck." and my
application is now running without problems fore more than 24H! So,
inserting a delay in this point definitely makes some difference (has
was with adding some extra printk() in several points of
serial8250_startup()).
This said, for me, this is definitely a software problem. The question
is were?
I would appreciate if you (or anyone) could give me any pointers on how
to detect the cause of my kernel Oops (perhaps activating extra kernel
debug?)
Thanks,
José Gonçalves
