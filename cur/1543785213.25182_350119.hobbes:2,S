Is there any indication in the system log that your userland (news?) software 
was having problems? It may be entirely unrelated to your problem, but you 
should anyway be aware of a nasty unresolved issue with all smp kernels >=  
2.6.12 on smp x86_64 systems:

If you have any indication of userland problems, you might try
	echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space
which much reduces (but seemingly does not completely remove) this issue for 
most people.
