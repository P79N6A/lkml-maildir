Okay, I've figured out issue #1.  There's an error in the
parport_pc.c code such that it prints the irq number as the
dma number ( ... thus DMA 7 instead of DMA 3).
I append a patch that fixes this.  I'll submit it again with
a [PATCH] subject heading.
We still need to figure out #2: what is taking up ioport 0x530?
