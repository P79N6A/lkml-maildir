I will try this, thanks.  I had my period/buffer size the same, but the
rate I had 48000 .. maybe this could be it.
Also, I am positive that with alsa-lib-1.0.5, with/without mmap, it
would do the same, but I put it on without mmap last night, and now
about 22/24 hours later it was still playing, so it might be fixed
for non-mmap at least.
My audio controller is also an Intel (SoundMax):
-----

        Flags: bus master, medium devsel, latency 0, IRQ 201

and somebody else had an intel chipset mobo with yamaha sound chip
on, so I do not know if it might be with intel chipset based ac97
sound that this issue comes to light - anybody else have an sis/nvidia
based board?
Thanks,
