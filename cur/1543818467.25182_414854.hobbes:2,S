Subject: Announce loop-AES-v3.1d file/swap crypto package
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/4/10/108

loop-AES changes since previous release:
- Fixed Makefile incompatibility with USE_KBUILD=y build option.
- Fixed incompatibility with CONFIG_PAX_KERNEXEC=y PAX config option.
- Fixed incompatibility with old SuSE 8.0 kernel that caused scheduler
  interface to be misdetected.
- Changed mount to honor offset=N and sizelimit=N mount options when they
  were used in combination with random keys generating phash=random mount
  option. Old encrypted data is used in new keys generation, but earlier
  buggy version always read and erased old data at offset=0.
- Added mount patch from Max Vozeler that makes it easier to first fsck and
  then mount encrypted file systems.
