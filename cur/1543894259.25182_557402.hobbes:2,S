No. I'm not stupid.
The GPLv3 explicitly allows removing additional permissions.
So anybody who does "GPLv3 + additional permissions" is basically setting 
himself up for people taking those permissions away.
Since the Tivo kind of permission is in my opinion a *fundamental right* 
(or call if "freedom" if you want), then "GPLv3 + additional permissions" 
simply is not a viable alternative, since anybody could just decide to 
make improvements and strip those permissions.
The whole notion of "additional permissions" in the GPLv3 is totally 
pointless, since it's legally *exactly* the same as allowing dual 
licensing (which a license doesn't even have to spell out: you can 
dual-license *regardless* of the license!).
The reason for the "additional permissions" is just to make the LGPL go 
away, and become a sub-clause of the GPLv3.
If you really thought anything else, you're just uninformed and stupid, 
and didn't think things through.
