You need an IDE controller that supports ATA133.  For most existing
computers, that is going to require a new card.-----Original Message-----

But which IDE controllers support 48-bit addressing? Not all of them? Does
linux IDE driver support 48-bit for all of them? Do they require BIOS
upgrade in order to operate 48-bit?
Or can I just grab a 160GB Maxtor and 2.4.19-preX, stick them into whatever
box I have and be done with it?
