Hello!

Right.
Well, not right. It happens. Simply because you get packet
with newer timestamp after previous handler saw this packet
and did some actions. I just do not see any bad consequences.

No. The way, which you suggested, seems to be the best.
1. It even does not disable possibility to record timestamp inside
   driver, which Alan was afraid of. The sequence is:
	if (!skb->tstamp.off_sec)
                net_timestamp(skb);
2. Maybe, netif_rx() should continue to get timestamp in netif_rx().
3. NAPI already introduced almost the same inaccuracy. And it is really
   silly to waste time getting timestamp in netif_receive_skb() a few
   moments before the packet is delivered to a socket.
4. ...but clock source, which takes one of top lines in profiles
   must be repaired yet. :-)
