This is actually due to wake_sleeping_dependent and
dependent_sleeper dropping the runqueue lock.
Actually idle_balance can (in rare cases) drop the lock as well,
which I didn't notice earlier, so it is something that we
have been doing forever. The smtnice locking has just exposed
the problem for us, so I wrongfully bashed it earlier *blush*.

Well just because there is a specific condition that both callsites
require. That is, the task is neither running nor on the runqueue.
While task_onqueue is technically wrong if you're looking down into
the fine details of the priority queue management, I think it is OK
to go up a level of abstraction and say that the task is
"on the runqueue" if it is either running or waiting to run.
It is really the one condition that is made un-intuitive due to the
locking in schedule(), so I thought formalising it would be better.
Suggestions for a better name welcome? ;)
Your one liner would fix the problem too, of course. The important
thing at this stage is that it gets fixed for 2.6.11.
Thanks,
Nick
