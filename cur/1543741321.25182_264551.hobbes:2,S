.. and nobody knows how the universe would look if the speed of light 
wasn't constant.
Your point is pointless. No such distributed revision control system 
exists. And without BK, the people who have worked on them wouldn't 
largely even understand what's wrong with CVS.
In fact, I find that people largely _still_ don't understand what's wrong
with CVS, and are still trying to just make another CVS thing.
So give Larry the credit he deserves, even if you dislike the license.
