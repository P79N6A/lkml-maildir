Well.  The radix-tree approach's best-case is probably quite a lot worse
than the list-based approach's best-case.  It hits a lot more cachelines
and involves a lot more code.
But of course the radix-tree's worst-case will be far better than list's.
And presumably that list-based code rarely hits the worst-case, else it
would have been changed by now.
