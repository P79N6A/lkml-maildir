That's OK, because we have to flush tlbs there too.

I think we just have to make sure that it _can_ do writeprotect
faults. AFAIKS, that will be possible if the driver registers a
.page_mkwrite handler (actually not quite -- page_mkwrite is fairly
crap, so I have a patch to merge it together with .fault so we get
address information as well). Anyway, I really think we should do
it that way.

Possibly, but hopefully not needed for performance. Let's wait and
see.
