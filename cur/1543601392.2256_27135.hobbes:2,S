That was most certainly a problem which is now fixed. Mainly the
preallication of swap was a waste. But I think there was a kind of
physical (not pte) overaging too that forbidden the vm to react
properly.
I believe when the storm of swap_out startups it won't matter any longer
what we aged and whatever pte scanning we did previously. At least with
the current swap_out.
