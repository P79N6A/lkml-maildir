This is a generic problem. Does any driver check if the bus it is
registering against is really present? Or should the driver core check
whether a bus is registered when someone tries to register a
device/driver?

What we need to do here is to make sure we get to know that something
went really wrong here. If a BUG_ON is considered preferrable to oopses
on platform device registering, I can roll a patch.
