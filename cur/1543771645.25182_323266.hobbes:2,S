I see your point. My intention was to make the include file structure 
completely symmetric and thus easy to review. The following table 
illustrates how we build up the spinlock type and primitives in the SMP 
and UP cases:
   SMP                         |  UP
   ----------------------------|-----------------------------------
   asm/spinlock_types.h        |  asm-generic/spinlock_types_up.h
   linux/spinlock_types.h      |  linux/spinlock_types.h
   asm/spinlock.h              |  asm-generic/spinlock_up.h
   linux/spinlock_smp.h        |  linux/spinlock_up.h
   linux/spinlock.h            |  linux/spinlock.h
as you can see in the list above, whenever something comes from the asm 
directory, in the UP case we pick it from asm-generic. But i accept your 
point that the use of asm-generic/ for this is improper, and i've moved 
those files into include/linux/. (I also have renamed spinlock_smp.h and 
spinlock_up.h to spinlock_api_smp.h and spinlock_api_up.h, to avoid the 
filename clash.) The naming is still symmetric:
   SMP                         |  UP
   ----------------------------|-----------------------------------
   asm/spinlock_types_smp.h    |  linux/spinlock_types_up.h
   linux/spinlock_types.h      |  linux/spinlock_types.h
   asm/spinlock_smp.h          |  linux/spinlock_up.h
   linux/spinlock_api_smp.h    |  linux/spinlock_api_up.h
   linux/spinlock.h            |  linux/spinlock.h
all this splitup structure was created based on a pretty simple rule:
whenever some aspect is sufficiently dissimilar to be #ifdef
CONFIG_SMP-ed, it gets into separate _smp and _up files. If it's generic
and shared it gets into the main spinlock.h file. The splitups were only
done to enable this clean structure.

ok, i've added the #error protectors.

done.
