nobody is suggesting that you leave peocesses running while you do the snapshot, 
what is being proposed is
1. pause userspace (prevent scheduling)
2. make snapshot image of memory
3. make mounted filesystems read-only (possibly with snapshot/checkpoint)
4. unpause
5. save image (with full userspace available, including network)
6. shutdown system (throw away all userspace memory, no need to do graceful
    shutdown or nice kill signals, revert filesystem to snapshot/checkpoint if
    needed)

all that's needed for the snapshot is to prevent userspace from scheduling, and 
prevent media from being written to in a permanent way (writing to a LVM volume 
after invoking a snapshot doesn't count, just revert to the snapshot)
