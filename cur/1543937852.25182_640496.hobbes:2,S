I completely agree with you here. But, unless this page : 
http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Function-Attributes.html
is not up-to-date anymore, there is no free attribute. Which
is quite logical, actually, as such an attribute would be
equivalent to simply marking the parameter of the function
non-const.
That's what I was alluding to, when speaking of a legitimate
change (adding attribute malloc to kmalloc()) which would break
another part of the kernel. Of course, we can also assume that
nobody would make the error of letting kfree() taking a 
const void* after that, but experience shows that programmers
are very likely to fall into such traps.
(No flame intended on anybody : in my case, I'm actually able
to fall even when there is no trap at all. That's the reason for
spotting such a weird one makes me anxious. Especially since
having kfree() take a non-const argument comes at no runtime
cost.)
