[PATCH] cpufreq: make the transition_notifier chain use SRCU
(b4dfdbb3c707474a2254c5b4d7e62be31a4b7da9)
breaks cpu frequency notification users, which register the callback on
core_init level. Interestingly enough the registration survives the
uninitialized head, but the registered user is lost by:
static int __init init_cpufreq_transition_notifier_list(void)
{
	srcu_init_notifier_head(&cpufreq_transition_notifier_list);
	return 0;
}
core_initcall(init_cpufreq_transition_notifier_list);
This affects i386, x86_64 and sparc64 AFAICT, which call
register_notifier early in the arch code.

Hmm, there are no static initializers for srcu and the only way to fix
this up is to move the arch calls to postcore_init.
