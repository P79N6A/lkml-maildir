It definitely does, it's also the only thing it does.
The whole point is that O_DIRECT can start the instruction after
page_count returns as far as I can tell.
If you check the three emails I linked in answer to Andrew on the
topic, we agree the o_direct can't start under PT lock (or under
mmap_sem in write mode but migrate.c rightefully takes the read
mode). So the fix used in ksm page_wrprotect and in fork() is to check
page_count vs page_mapcount inside PT lock before doing anything on
the pte. If you just mark the page wprotect while O_DIRECT is in
flight, that's enough for fork() to generate data corruption in the
parent (not the child where the result would be undefined). But in the
parent the result of the o-direct is defined and it'd never corrupt if
this was a cached-I/O. The moment the parent pte is marked readonly, a thread
in the parent could write to the last 512bytes of the page, leading to
the first 512bytes coming with O_DIRECT from disk being lost (as the
write will trigger a cow before I/O is complete and the dma will
complete on the oldpage).
We do the check in page_wprotect because that's the _first_ place
where we mark a pte readonly. Same as fork. And we can't convert a pte
from writeable to wrprotected without doing this check inside PT lock
or we generate data corruption with o_direct (again same as the bug in
fork).
We don't have to check the page_count vs mapcount later in
replace_page because we know if anybody started an O_DIRECT read from
disk, it would have triggered a cow, and the pte_same check that we
have to do for other reasons would take care of bailing out the
replace_page.

The oldpage is a regular anonymous page for us, not the 'strange'
object called PageKSM. And we need to migrate many anonymous pages
having destination a single PageKSM page already preallocated and not
being an anonymous page. We never migrate PageKSM to anything, that's
always the destination.

Anonymous page is anything with page->mapping pointing to an anon_vma
or swapcache_space instead of an address_space of a real inode backed
by the vfs.
