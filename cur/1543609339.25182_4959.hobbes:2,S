Deny.  That's the patch Rik rightly posted for -ac, to remove some
code which was appropriate only to -linus, because of other changes
in -linus omitted from -ac: it fixed the meminfo Cached field in -ac.
The meminfo Cached field in -linus also sometimes went wrong.  Mike
Fedyk pursued that issue, Andrew Morton identified it as a wrong
line of code in the ext3 patch for -linus, and that line is not
(he has just assured us) in ext3 as it appears in 2.4.15-pre2.
So, no further patch required.
