I checked my VAIO's, and they all have a Ricoh cardbus bridge.
Ted claimed he had a TI1311 or something, I think. So his VAIO is
definitely different from the ones I have. That may be enough of a
difference.
(But I know I've tried TI bridges too, and have had multiple success
reports with them. They are not uncommon. They _do_ tend to need more
initialization than some of the other bridges, and maybe that's the
difference. Ted, can you send me the lspci -vvxxx output with the full
config space setup?)
