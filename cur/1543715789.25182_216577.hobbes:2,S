I don't see a need to get all complicated about this.
This is simple, really: since a C string ends at the
'\0', the module has been declared to be GPL code.
We shouldn't care if that C string is part of a larger
array. This is a damn obvious case of willful circumvention
of copyright control, access control, digital rights
management, etc.
Unleash the sharks.
