Hello,
	I'm considering porting Linux to TurboChannel based boxes.
	I was able to get quite a bit of doc's from NetBSD's site,
	but not all of them are on-line. 
	I'm still missing:
		Alpha Architecture Reference Manual (Second Edition)
		DEC order number: EY-T132E-DP
	Thus, I had been wondering, does anyone knows Point-of-Contact
	for technical datascheets in Comapaq??
Thanks a lot,
Adam
