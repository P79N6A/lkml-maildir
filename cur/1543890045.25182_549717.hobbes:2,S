I know what they do, you don't need to repeatedly reexplain them.
My point was just that in all the __init/__initdata warnings I recently fixed
personally there wasn't a single one that wasn't a false positive and frankly I don't
see any sign of them really showing real bugs. Basically effort:gain doesn't
seem to be well balanced here.
