Ok. I went to implementation details(and ended up less straight forward..) but
my main intention was to say that we need to retain some sort of hierarchical 
shape too, while creating these domain partitions.
Like for example, a big system can be divided into different groups of
cpus for each department in an organisation. And internally based
on the needs, each department can divide its pool of cpus into sub groups
and allocates to much smaller group. And based on the sub group creation/
deletion, cpus will move from department to subgroups and viceversa.
users probably want both flat and hierarchical partitions. And in this
partition mechanism, we should never allow cpus being present in more than one
partition.
