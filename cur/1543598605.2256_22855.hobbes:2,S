Looks like the change int he usb_start_wait_urb code is a problem. 
I suspect either you need to add wmb() and rmb() to stop misoptimisations
on done (along with making it (!timeout && !awd.done)
Or
there is a signal related problem - if so  making it set the state
to TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE might cure it
