I'm curious how you do that.  It seems each level would have to be 64K
large in order to do that, with a minimum disk space consumption of 128K
for a directory.  That seems extremely painful *except* in the case of
hysterically large directories, which tend to be the exception even on
filesystems where they occur.
I think I'd rather take the extra complexity and rebalancing cost of a
B-tree.
