This is incorrect.
SWAP is used on a [1GB ram/2GB swap system].
I talked to Rik about this.
He said generally SWAP is a good thing and increases performance.
However, in my case it does not.
Nov 22 12:18:41 <war> riel: For a single user system.
Nov 22 12:18:43 <ata> war: what are you trying to do ?
Nov 22 12:18:44 <riel>  war: it all depends on what you use the computer for
Nov 22 12:18:56 <riel>  war: that's a very important thing to specify ;)
Nov 22 12:18:57 <war> General X apps, staroffice/netscape/media
stuff(aviplay)/etc
Nov 22 12:19:06 <war> compiling apps once and awhile
Nov 22 12:19:13 <riel>  war: ok, in that case you omost likely don't need swap
Nov 22 12:19:32 <riel>  war: but you really _need_ to tell what you are using
the computer for before anybody can give a sensible answer ;)
Nov 22 12:19:43 <war> riel: thats what I thought too, yet people still say I do
even after I told them what I was using it for
Nov 22 12:19:52 <ata> learath: nope 1gb will still win just one app will loose
and die
Nov 22 12:19:54 <war> riel: I sent the list of my ps auxww (512 processes) and
I still had 350MB left over.
Nov 22 12:20:05 <riel>  war: yup, I saw that
