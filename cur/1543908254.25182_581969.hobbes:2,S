Yes, the kernel requirements are much stricter than ISO-C. And besides
it is a heavy user of C extensions anyways. On the other hand some of the
C99 extensions are not allowed. And then there is sparse, which enforces
a language which sometimes is quite far from standard C. You could say it is 
written in Linux-C, not ISO C.
