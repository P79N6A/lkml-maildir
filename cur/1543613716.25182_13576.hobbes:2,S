  Bus  0, device  11, function  0:
    ISA bridge: Symphony Labs W83C553 (rev 16).
  Bus  0, device  11, function  1:
    IDE interface: Symphony Labs SL82c105 (rev 5).
      IRQ 31.

> Does the Engineering notice give PCI INTC as a pre-condition?
Yes.  When bit 11 (LEGIRQ) of the IDE control/status register is set IDE 
IRQs are sent to INTC and/or INTD.  This is a pre-condition.  The 
problem is that the controller gets confused on an unfinished DMA and 
erroneously waits for ack on IRQA/B.
