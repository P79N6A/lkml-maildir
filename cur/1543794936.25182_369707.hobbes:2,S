It is, though maybe not "officially". It's developped by an nVidia
employee. That's also why it's totally obfuscated: there is not a single
register name in there, only a vast list of magic numbers & magic
values. Mark (the author) claims that he prefers that way and nobody
else is supposed to work on the driver but him ... I find those
arguments a bit bogus (people _do_ occasionally hack on this driver,
and/or use it for the kernel nvidiafb etc...) but heh.. he's the author
so he does what he wants.
Ben.
