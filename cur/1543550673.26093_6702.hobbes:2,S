	Which might be their problem.  i haven't used RedHat for a while
(switched to Debian), but the Redhat kernel might not have the right support
compiled in.  Also, were they using an Ultra160 drive?  And an Ultra160 cable?

	Which is a bunch of bullsh*t.  i have an Adaptec 39160 and it works
beautifully.  With regards to the docs, i found this under the "Supported
cards/chipsets" section around line 42 of drivers/scsi/README.aic7xxx (in both
2.4.0 and 2.2.17):
