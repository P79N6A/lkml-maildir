just a final confirmation (before I start to irritate someone with a
multitude of mails) - although I still think macro approach is
unacceptable, using static inline (thanks to David for pointing out) is
acceptable but leaves one final question which can only be answered by the
maker (of decisions):
  Q. What is the right design decision for Linux - to have a CONFIG_KMOD
     dependency in the header that declares request_module() or to have
     an extra function call in a non-performance critical code path that
     invokes request_module() but avoid the dependency?
I use Stalin's expression "both are better" :) and leave the question to
Linus, if he find a minute to answer it.
