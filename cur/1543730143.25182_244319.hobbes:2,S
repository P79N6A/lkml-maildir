I _really_ think that if we're going to make spinlocks be out-of-line, 
then we need to out-of-line the preemption code too.
And at that point I'm more than happy to just make it unconditional,
assuming the profiling thing (which was my only worry) has been verified.
And I suspect that the all-C version is pretty much equivalent to the
assembler one, if you use FASTCALL() to make gcc at least use register 
argument passing conventions. The advantage is much clearer code, I'd say.
