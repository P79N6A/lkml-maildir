Hello, Jeff.
Yeah, I didn't like that line either, but the thing that triggered this 
patch is this message from Linus.  This is a reply to Andrew's 
dropped-from-rc message so not on lkml.

The code he was talking about looks like.
if (rq->flags & (REQ_SOFTBARRIER | REQ_HARDBARRIER) {
	....
	if (blk_barrier_rq(rq))
		q->ordcolor ^= 1;
	....
}
We could add blk_barrier_rq() to test for both flags and add 
blk_hardbarrier_rq() and blk_softbarrier_rq(), but the flags are not 
used that widely and some other flag testing macros are used only few 
times in core block layer, so I determined to kill infrequently used macros.
I agree that the change makes code harder to eyes in some places, but it 
doesn't obfuscate the code and results in less maintenance overhead in 
general.  Remember a few testing macros is okay but remembering a dozen 
gets a bit annoying, IMHO.
Thanks.
