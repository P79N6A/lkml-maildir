I did some more testing (everything under 2.2.5):
* created a primary partition (full size) with fdisk -b 2048 /dev/sdc 
 (fdisk 2.9i - fdisk 2.9g created a buggy one)
* formatted the partition with mke2fs -b 2048 -m 0 -L test /dev/sdc1
 (mke2fs 1.14)
* mounted the partition (as user, with mount 2.9i)
* copied my quake2 dir to it
* umounted it
* rebooted
* ran "e2fsck -B 2048 -f -n /dev/sdc1 >/tmp/01"  (write-protected disk,
e2fsck 1.14). /tmp/01 is 315194 bytes. Tons of errors
Please don't tell me this is a feature.
