That's the way I see it, too.

We use mlockall() to avoid page faults in the audio path.  That should
be happening in all these tests.  The JACK server would complain if
the request were failing, and it doesn't.
How can I verify that the pages are actually locked?  (Even without
mlock(), I don't think I would run out of memory.)
