Is real O_NONBLOCK support on the horizon for Linux?  It's annoying to have to
create worker threads to read from disk despite doing all the socket I/O on one
thread with poll()...
I'm not on the list, I watch from the archives.
Thanks.
(yes i know its been discussed before... no solid denials but no implementation
either)
