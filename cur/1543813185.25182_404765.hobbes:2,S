Also use "make checkstack", "make buildcheck", and "make namespacecheck"
to check for problems that they can detect.

I disagree that lkml should always be used.  It is becoming terribly
over-burdened recently so either people are spending more time reading
too much email or they are ignoring it.  It would be better IMO to
send patches for focused mailing lists that are appropriate for the
driver.

I disagree with that last part.  I guess I have seen some reluctance
occasionally, but I don't think that it's the (main) reason for
drivers not being accepted into the kernel tree.
