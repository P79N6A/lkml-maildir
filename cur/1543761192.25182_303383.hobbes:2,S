ah. Yeah. Sniff.
if we gain 1000% on a 16-way then there's something really wrong about
semaphores (or scheduling) though. A semaphore is almost a spinlock, in
the uncontended case - and even under contention we really (should) just
spend the cycles that we'd spend spinning. There will be some
intermediate contention level where semaphores hurt, but 1000% sounds
truly excessive.
