It makes it better. The specific process causing the problem is now
identified. Especially if resource allocation and quotas are used.
Nearly every program that is run has a deterministic amount of
memory required. In the cases that the amount of resources is not
sufficient then the specific process has broken/changed the
assumptions used in computing the amount. This allows for examining
why that partitcular process exceeded its quota. If the determiniation
is made that more resources are required, you have a justification for
purchasing more memory and/or swap space. Without that accounting cycle
it becomes "gee - linux crashed again.... lets get something that won't..."

This is a matter of implementation. It is not a "theoretical problem" but
a practical application of resource accounting and quota control.

wrong. It will make it possible to identify the offender, and to prevent
it from impacting other processes. Many large multiuser systems run this
way, and do NOT have the OOM problem. Implementation is not easy, and the
accounting practices have to be clearly documented. BUT it is worth it.
