Yes FS == "filesystem", sorry, I thought that was generic.

Alex,
If you want to be able to access the drives ATA or SCSI at the drive level
there needs to be a method of doing so.
Matt asked can he go to a specified physical drive address and read a
given number of sectors from the drive.  This is different than what
everyone else is giving him answers for by adjusting the FS block-size.

Total Lame Answers, okay .... :-)
Can you tell me how to get/do this request?  (seriously).
	read(32 sectors, beginning at LBA 50)
How can one do this through the FS-layer?
Cheers,
