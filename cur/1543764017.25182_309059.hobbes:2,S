Technically, according to the article, the only safe time to do it is in the BIOS or in one of their special safe CDs that freezes the drive before the boot loader loads.  This makes sense because a particularly malicious place to put something like this is a worm that attaches to your boot loader.  Then, even doing it in the kernel at boot time is too late.
