:-) You change the subject.
There are many filesystems that only have room for 32 bits.
For example, NFSv2 has "unsigned int rdev".
So, the kernel must be able to handle 32-bit device numbers.
Now about the encoding - nobody knows. This NFS filesystem was mounted
from a FreeBSD system. It is encoded 16+8+8 with the middle 8 the major.
Or, no, it was Solaris or Irix. Encoded 14+18. Etc.
In the case of NFSv2 there is an unknown system on the other side.
Internally for Linux we have not yet used larger device numbers
so there are no cases of 16+16 yet. But there will be occasions
where we have to store a device number in 32 bits, and what I am
saying is that life is easiest if we use 16+16 in such cases.
