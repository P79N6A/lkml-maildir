Thanks,
They work sweet - we've been running for over a week now with absolutely 
no problems whatsoever (longer than what the 2.3.25 kernel has been 
doing of the last 2 months or so - also seen a massive increase in 
performance from 2.4.25 -> 2.6.4rc1).  When can we expect to see these 
changes in the main kernel - even if only patched in but still depending 
on "broken" drivers to be selected, or marked as experimental?
