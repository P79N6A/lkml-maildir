>> The comment about  atomic_t - It is due to the fact that some ( IA-32 for e.g.) architectures guarantees atomicity of integer operations for only 24 bits. So you could possibly manipulate only 24 out of the 32 bits atomically - that's the hardware guarantee. The comments reflect this fact. (Pointers are 32bits on IA32 so it applies to pointer as well.)

Yes - I understand it better now. Thanks!
