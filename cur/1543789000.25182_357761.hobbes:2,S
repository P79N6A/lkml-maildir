Cool.  I didn't know that.  On Linux as you say the userspace intervention 
is the real problem due to non-X vs X and gnome vs KDE vs whatnot...  But 
I would imagine a simple userspace helper a-la /sbin/modprobe and things 
like that would be enough.  And that could then be system specific to 
display a message to the local user...
