What about using 'rom' variable for non-direct access too?
      unsigned char *rom = dev->rom_info.rom;
      char direct_access = rom == NULL;

You can do  'if (off >= size) ...' And well, where is size assigned at
all?

Test for failure? Test for no ROM devices?

readb(rom), readb(rom+1)?

Is off + count guaranteed to not overflow?

Please read it with readl. At least on my Matrox G550 reading 64KB ROM with
byte accesses takes 1334ms, with 16bit accesses 840ms and with
32bit (or 64bit MMX) accesses 551ms. Straight (non-IO aware) memcpy 
takes 535ms. And put some conditional_schedule()s here, 550ms (or even
34ms for 4KB chunk) is IMHO too long.

If you made changes suggested at the beginning, you can do this instead:
              val = rom[off];
                                                Best regards,
                                                    Petr Vandrovec
