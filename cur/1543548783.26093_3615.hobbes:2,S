   I can only see one place where we add a page to the page cache and
   we don't increase its page count, and it is in grow_buffers().
   Could somebody explain me _why_ we don't need to do a
   page_cache_get(page) in that function?
It's being added only to the LRU lists, not the page cache hashes. It
is a buffer-cache page not a page-cache page (ie. page->mapping ==
NULL).
The alloc_page() returns the page with a single reference, which thus
represents the refence to the page held by the buffer heads
grow_buffers attaches to it.
