Patrick Mochel already did it in his reworking of the arch/i386/kernel cruft
It's already merged in my tree, and will hopefully turn up in Linus' tree
sometime soon. So far, it's been dropped (probably because it rejected
when someone else touched something there)
I'll push the resynced version later today
