That's more or less what I found, although I found noatime also helped my test 
cases, but also less than the journal options. Coincidentally I only 
discovered this recently and hadn't gotten around to telling anyone how 
dramatic this was and this seemed as good a time as any. I am suspicious that 
it wasn't this bad in past kernels but haven't been able to instrument 
earlier kernels to check.
