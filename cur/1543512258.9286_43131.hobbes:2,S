major/minor is a hack to workaround /dev being on a regular
filesystem. major/minor is just a lookup table to translate opening
a file into associating some device+state with a file descriptor.
That's ALL majors and minors are -- indirection. lookup. a
workaround. a hack. Just because it is traditional doesn't mean that
it isn't a kludge.
devfs (and equivalents) directly associate the device file with the
driver, avoiding the need for the indirect lookup. And, therefore,
the need for major/minor numbers (major numbers at least). Because
they are in memory, the incore inode has a spot for
filesystem-specific data. This would include a driver entrypoint
plus some driver-specific data (equivalent to the minor number,
which has always been driver-specific). It probably _is_ the minor
number for compatibility and ease of porting, though it would often
be more efficient if it were not, but something more specific to the
device.
Now I should look at the devfs source to see if he did it that way...
Note that, for at least this implementation of a devfs, we are
exchanging one well-known and traditional workaround (major/minor
numbers), for a new and unfamiliar one (non-persistence of
non-default permissions/ownership).
