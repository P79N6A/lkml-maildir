Ok, so we may want to introduce something like "tell me if some data
came from last time"... Actually, 5KB/sec is pretty much okay, and you
probably could get around actually reading that data.
When you know user is moving the touchpad, you could just sleep for 5
seconds (assuming user activity) and only then start monitoring it
again?

Well, I do not think your kernel code is mergeable. But bits to enable
similar functionality in userspace probably would be mergeable.
