On the lowest level, it's possible using a protocol analyzer. If you 
don't have one, you need to be familiar with the controller's driver 
or its firmware. If the driver is based on libata, I think it's 
possible to get this information easier. Otherwise, such as in the 
case of mptsas, it can be completely hidden by the firmware.
