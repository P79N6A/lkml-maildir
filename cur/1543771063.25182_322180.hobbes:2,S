The scp or ftp start on a RT machine.
The destination is an RT or Non RT machine, the problem is the same.
It's not a space problem, I have 4GB available on the destination path.
I can reproduce the phenomena at each try.
If I <CTRL C> the scp when it is stalled then relaunch the scp command, the transfert restart without problem.
I'm trying to trace this problem but I don't know how to do this.
Has someone one method ?
