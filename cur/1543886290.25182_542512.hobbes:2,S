This doesn't answer the main question:
How often, if there's no maintainer reaction?
It happens that Andrew forwards patches from me in -mm 5 or 10 times to 
a maintainer until he gets any reaction from the maintainer.
Before I'd start the same with trivial patches, it would be easier to 
change the "trivial@kernel.org" mail alias to point to Andrew so that 
trivial patches can also become part of his "forward patches to 
maintainers again and again until there's any reaction" process.
That's not meant as a threat or anything like that, it's a serious 
suggestion to avoid duplicated work.
