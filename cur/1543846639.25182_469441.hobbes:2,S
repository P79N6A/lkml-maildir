Ah - that explains Joe's preference for putting the actual implementing
code in the user version - it gets to pull in the user string one
char at a time, avoiding a malloc'd buffer.
I tend to make more coding mistakes that way, so have gotten in the
habit of keeping my scanning code separate from any code required to
get a nice safe local copy of the input that is to be scanned.
I agree with Joe - either way can be made to work - author's
discretion.  Just be sure to impose that sanity limit.
