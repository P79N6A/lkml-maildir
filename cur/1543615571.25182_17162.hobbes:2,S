ok. Generally there is no guarantee that the parent will run first under
the current scheduler, but it's likely to run first. But if eg. a higher
priority process preempts the forking process while it's doing fork() then
the child will run first in 50% of the cases. So this ordering is not
guaranteed by the 2.4 (or 2.2) Linux scheduler in any way.
