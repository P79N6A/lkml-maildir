Yes, that works. I'm impressed that even old mounts handle this
correctly.

If I try something like:
--- linux.18p14/fs/fat/inode.c      Sun Oct  1 12:20:41 2000
+++ linux.18p14/fs/fat/inode.c.new  Mon Oct  2 08:35:02 2000
@@ -216,7 +216,7 @@
        opts->quiet = opts->sys_immutable = opts->dotsOK =
opts->showexec = 0;
        opts->codepage = 0;
        opts->utf8 = 0;
-       opts->small_letter = 0;
+       opts->small_letter = 1;
        opts->iocharset = NULL;
        *debug = *fat = 0;
then msdos mounts work as they used to but vfat mounts are also
affected. I suspect someone didn't consider all the possibilities.
In any event, breaking long-standing behavior (at least as far back as
1.2 kernels) seems like a bad idea.
Thanks.
