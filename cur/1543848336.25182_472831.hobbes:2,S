>Is sysfs interface compatible to hdaps one?
Well, pretty close:
1) calibrate and position attributes behave the same (as far as I can tell 
by looking at hdaps source)
2) mdps has options to enable/disable mouse and power, but lacks variance, 
temp and
{keyboard,mouse}_activity
But hdapsd only uses position and mouse/keyboard activity stuff. mouse, 
keyboard activity
I can't provide for a simple reason that the chip does not give it to me 
(got the spec).
But since position is in the same format, it should be relatively easy to 
make hdaps work
with mdps as well.
