Thanks!  I'm determined to keep Squashfs as small/efficient as  
possible, as that's where I see its main advantages.

There are quite a few third-party LZMA patches for Squashfs.  OpenWRT  
(for wifi routers) uses an LZMA patched Squashfs.
I've been asked about using LZMA for Squashfs quite a few times.   
The  major problem as I see it with LZMA is it is not supported by  
the Linux kernel, and I don't want to use anything that might prevent  
it being merged!  At the moment I'm happy with the current situation  
where there's third party patches available for those that want or  
need it.  Of course if the situation changed with LZMA going into the  
Linux kernel, then I'd see no problem in using it in Squashfs.
