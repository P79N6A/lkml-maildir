A dynamic pool will smooth thread creation/freeing up by a lot.
And, in my box a *pthread* create/free takes ~10us, at 1000/s is 10ms, 1%.

Look, I'm *definitely* not trying to advocate the use of async syscalls for 
network here, just pointing out that when we're talking about threads, 
Linux does a pretty good job.
