 Very odd indeed.  I suggest you post the relevant information (like the 
bootstrap log, output from `lspci -v', the contents of /proc/cpuinfo, 
etc.) together with the description of the problem (so that the report is 
self-contained) here and perhaps somebody will be able to diagnose it 
properly.  It could be some ACPI breakage.
