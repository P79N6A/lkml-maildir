I really fail to see your point, it's trivial to make
files which are easy to read by humans and also very
easy to parse by shellscripts.
PROCESSOR=0
VENDOR_ID=GenuineIntel
CPU_FAMILY=6
MODEL=6
MODEL_NAME="Celeron (Mendocino)"
.....
As you can see, this is easily readable by humans,
while "parsing" by a shell script would be as follows:
. /proc/cpuinfo
After which you could just "echo $PROCESSOR" or
something like that ...
Yes, this is probably a bad example, but it does show
that machine-readable and human-readable aren't mutually
exclusive.
regards,
Rik
