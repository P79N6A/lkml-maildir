Have a look at my skfilter patches:
http://people.redhat.com/jmorris/selinux/skfilter/kernel/
These implement a scheme for matching incoming packets against sockets by 
adding a new hook in the socket layer.
For upstream merge, the issues are:
- should the new socket hook be used for all incoming packets?
- ensure IP queuing still works
Patrick: any other issues?
