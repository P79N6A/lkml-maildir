It is Cisco Speak. In Linux you simply give the Interface an IP Address of
an exisiting Interface, and then you have an "unnumbered" interface. It
simply means it does not add an additional address.
Routing in modern operating systems is so easy and natural with interface
and host routes, dont worry about cisco legacy.
