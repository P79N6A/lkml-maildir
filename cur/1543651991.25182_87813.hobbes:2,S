You can use a spinlock and, in fact, that's the only way you can
protect a critical section. The other CPU will spin of course, just
like the other CPU in a maskable interrupt. That's what spin-locks
are for. With maskable interrupts, the "cli" affects only the CPU
that actually fetches that instruction. That's why you need spin-lock
protection when you have more than one CPU. With NMI, no CPU has
the effect a "cli" would provide, so they just spin at the lock
until the lock is released.
