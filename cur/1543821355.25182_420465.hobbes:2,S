Stephen Hemminger has agreed to help out with net driver maintenance 
through May 12, when I return from honeymoon.  Thanks, Stephen!
I've got a few patches for 2.6.17-rc that I'll push in the next 24 
hours, then I'm unplugged until May 12.  Already unsubscribed from LKML, 
even <sniff>.
netdev-2.6.git#upstream is what I have queued for 2.6.18 so far.
