	f-series CKRM manages tasks via the task struct -- this means it
manages each thread and not a process. Since, generally speaking, each
thread is assigned the same class as the main thread this effectively
manages processes. So yes, separate DB2, Oracle, Apache, etc. threads
could be assigned to different classes. This is definitely something a
strict container could not do.

I wouldn't say only for databases. human-interaction-bound processes can
share instances (gnome-terminal). Granted, these probably would never
need to span a container or a class...

	Yes, being able to move a process from one class to another is
important. This can happen as a consequence of the system administrator
deciding to change the distribution of resources without having to
restart services. The change in distribution can be done by changing
shares of a class, manually moving processes between classes, by making
or deleting classes, or a combination of these operations.
