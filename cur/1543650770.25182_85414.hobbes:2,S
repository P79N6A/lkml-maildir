ah, I see ... that's an enhanced interrupt controller which is used
on SMP boards. is it correct that this one is only configured/activated
when:
.config
[...]
# CONFIG_X86_UP_APIC is not set
# CONFIG_X86_UP_IOAPIC is not set
these options are set? therefore, since this options are off, the
IO-APIC is not being used, correct?
