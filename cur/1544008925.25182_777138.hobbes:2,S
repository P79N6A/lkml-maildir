It doesn't help on my box, though.  I've got a failure to resume from
hibernation on the first attempt.
However, this one appears to work reliably for me (on top of vanilla current
mainline):

Well, in fact I'm pretty sure this is the case.  By changing memory address
space layout we effectively change conditions during suspend-resume and
apparently we can choose one for which the failure condition doesn't trigger
(or, IOW, the probability of it is _so_ small that we just can't see it).
There seems to be a race of some kind or a missing delay or something similar.
Thanks,
