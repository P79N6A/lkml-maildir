My impressions of the latest Alan's kernel are very bad, compared to
2.4.9-ac10 which I'm happily running in a Pentium III laptop with 128Mb
RAM and 400Mb swap.
It hardly touches swap (not at least in top) but the IDE disk never stops.
If I run setiathome it's absolutely impossible to do anything at all.
Large applications that take seconds to start now take minutes!!
Just my 2c
