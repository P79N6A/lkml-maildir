I have just get a new notebook, and it works fairly good with linux
(just linux no time for windows here) everything works except for one
problem which I have not been able to solve. 
My notebook is an Acer Extensa 367T and as I have said everything works.
There is just one thing I'm a bit disappointed about. I haven't been
able of finding an appropriate driver for my IDE controller, which means
that I have to do with no DMA support, and that kind of slow...
Does anybody know of any good resources for writing a device driver. I
have the following.
	'Kernel Hackers Guide'
	'The Linux Kernel'
	'Linux Module Programmers Guide'
lspci tells me it's a controller build by Acer Labs so I'll ask them for
the appropriate data. (Hope they will give it to me...)
Anyway. If such a driver already exist please tell me. I have never
played with the kernel before except for standard compiles.
Andreas
