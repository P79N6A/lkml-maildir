Sorry, not actually understand your question... :(
There is not much problems with virtualization of proc. It can be 
virtualized correctly, so that tools are still working. For example, in 
OpenVZ /proc has 2 trees - global and local.
global tree contains the entries which are visiable in all containers.
and local tree - only those which are visible to containers.
PIDs are shown also only those which present in container.
