Good point, we are able to sustain 32MB/sec when reading data off four
SCSI tape drives in parallel and sending data over the wire via TCP on
Gigabit Ethernet on a dual 450MHz Linux box. I am quite certain Linux
will be able to cope under good LAN like conditions as you say, the
task is to setup a realistic test which people will accept. Of course
using ftp does itself help mess things up ;-)
