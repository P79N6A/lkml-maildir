Lovely!  Thanks for your report, and especially your art - you are the
lucky winner of a huge churn of milk for first report of this message,
just send your details etc. etc.
Yes, more or less a debugging message: nothing bad has happened, just
something rather inefficient, and we'd like to get some idea of how
much it occurs in practice.  xterm, eh?  I wouldn't have guessed that.
Quite a herd.
I hoped a whimsical message might be reported more than a boring one!
