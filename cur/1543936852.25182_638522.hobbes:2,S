The most usual case is hid2hci utility, that tries to switch modes on 
Bluetooth HID peripherials (via hiddev). When these "switching" packets 
are not compliant with HID report descriptor of the device, this WARN_ON() 
happens.
Unfortunately there is no standard specifying how these packets should 
look like, so it is guess-game and some rev-eng, that Marcel has put into 
hid2hci for individual vendors, and sometimes this just happens not to 
work.
I have had the commit below queued in my tree for 2.6.25 for quite some 
time

    HID: remove redundant WARN_ON()s in order not to scare users
    The WARN_ON() in implement() and extract() spit out stacktraces and
    a lot of other information that might make users think that there is
    something seriously wrong with the system. WARN_ON() should not be
    deliberately triggerable by userspace application, which these can be.
    Usually this WARN_ON() triggers when hid2hci utility is sending the
    data that don't correspond to the device's report descriptor.
    Convert these messages to more friendly printk().
