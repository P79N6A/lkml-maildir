Without knowing anything about it, I'm willing to guess "programmer
laziness/lack of time" (depending on your perspective).  As long as ALSA
continues to provide OSS emulation, lazy developers will not update
their apps to the (superior) ALSA API.
I just upgraded all my home machines to a Gnome 2.10 based distro and
way shocked to find that it still uses esd via OSS emulation for system
sounds.  So the endless user complaints about "wtf, esd is blocking my
sound device, on windows my apps can share it" will not be going away in
the forseeable future.
Ugh.  dmix has only been available for, oh, 18 months, and the apps
still have not caught up.
