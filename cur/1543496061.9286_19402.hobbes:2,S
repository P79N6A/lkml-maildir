In a IDE box using an Asus 40x CD-ROM drive and a Mitsumi 2801TE CD-Writer
(firmware from January 1999), both on ide1, ide-scsi detects the drives
several times (print_inquiry() in scsi.c is called several times, for
whatever reason).
There's no actual SCSI controller in the computer.
In 2.2.0, it used to work, but we've been getting a couple of "SCSI bus
reset"s at boot time (still no SCSI controller there, and no support for
any SCSI controllers compiled in) after a recompilation.
Don't have the time to debug it myself right now - any clues?
