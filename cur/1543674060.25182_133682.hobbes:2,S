Yea, I'd like to see a sample reset/update implementation as well. 
Right now in i386 land we do the compensation for lost ticks in
mark_offset_tsc/cyclone. The reason for this is that every interrupt we
only want to read the high-res timesource once in order to avoid any
atomicity issues. So all the interpolation and compensation has to
happen in the same place (or atleast using the same data).
I probaly need to spend some more time looking over this. However the
sample implementation would likely give me the "aha!" i need. 
thanks
