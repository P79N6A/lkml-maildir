Hi,
I want to read the the /proc file created by kernel
module A from another kernel module B. The structure
is shared by both the module. 
In another way, can I have a /proc file shared between
many kernel modules so that I can pass parameters
between these module using /proc file ?
Regards,
-Niranjan
