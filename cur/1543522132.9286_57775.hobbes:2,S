ORBS was intended to be a proactive version of the MAPS RBL (Paul Vixie's
project). ORBS has been a hot debate item on various anti-spam mailing lists
almost since it's inception. They are also blocking above.net which hosts VA
linux systems, linux.com, Ebay, etc. Dave Rand (founder of Above.net and author
of the free MRTG software) is violently anti-spam. Above.net is being blocked by
ORBS because above.net is filtering probes from ORBS. Above.net feels that ORBS
probes are network abuse (rightly so IMHO.)
Basically, ORBS is run by a megalomaniac who wants to force his views on others.
He is loosing. Nobody in their right mind that knows the story of ORBS would
use ORBS to block email. MANY systems are in ORBS database because the systems
admins disagree with the ORBS admin, NOT because they are open relays.
