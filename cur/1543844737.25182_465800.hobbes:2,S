Regarding the GPLv2 vs v3 debate, i don't think anyone is in favour of a
different view, but ..

When applied to subsystems, the patch author "A" applies his/her patch
to the repo, the MAINTAINER cherry picks the patches for submitting to
the kernel.
In such a case, it becomes,
Signed-off-by: A
Signed-off-by: MAINTAINER
in a subsystem there are indeed many contributors, eventually it is indeed
Signed-off-by: "x"
Signed-off-by: MAINTAINER
So it is indeed incorrect to term that the MAINTAINER is the most
popular Contributor, because the CONTRIBUTOR is the PATCH AUTHOR
himself, not the MAINTAINER.
