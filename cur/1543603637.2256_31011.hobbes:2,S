Two points to be aware of.
- Kernel hackers move sometimes :)
  Be sure to associate the two (or more) addresses of any hacker
  with one person. Automating this may be quite difficult in some
  cases.. My data from a year or so ago was completely different
  to current. I think every field has changed since then.
  On the other hand, it may be interesting to see the data tracking
  hackers movements over the past few years :)
- Tracking by snail mail address (where present) is more accurate
  than by email address TLD.
  (Mine states .de, but I'm actually in London, UK for example)

Happy to help.
