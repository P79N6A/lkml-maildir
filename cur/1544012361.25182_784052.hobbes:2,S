BTW, XFS open-by-inode implementation is severely broken - try using
it for directories and you'll get all kinds of hell breaking loose.
And that's the only attempt at iopen in Linux.
While we are at it, iget() is not a generic interface - it's strictly
up to specific filesystem whether that sucker will work at all.  Or
what kind of data will have to be required for it to work on given fs,
assuming it will work to start with.

... and inotify is unreliable by design, or what passes for it anyway.

	For one thing, opened directory can be fchdir'ed to.  Or passed to
openat() et.al.  For another, go ahead, show me how to implement that
sucker for something like NFS.  Or CIFS.  Or FAT, while we are at it.
Or anything that does have stable numbers identifying fs objects, but where
those numbers are huge.

e) start with providing a higher-level description of what you want to
achieve.  While we are at it, is it supposed to be fs-agnostic?  What
kinds of filesystems could in principle be used with that?
So far you've mentioned use of blatantly inadequate tool and far too
low-level description of changes that might possibly make it more
tolerable for unspecified use you have in mind.  I'm sorry, but that's
exactly how a bunch of bad APIs (including inotify) got pushed into the
tree and I would rather not repeat the experience.
Interfaces must make sense.  And "we need <list of things> for our project,
nevermind what are they for, here's what we would like to see" is a recipe
for kludges.  Inotify, dnotify, F_SETLEASE, etc.  Sigh...
