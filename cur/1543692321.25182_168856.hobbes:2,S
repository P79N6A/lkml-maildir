Interesting. I'm pretty sure I did a "make allyesconfig" just before the
test6 release, so apparently x86 includes it indirectly through some path, 
and so it only shows up on m68k and arm?
This, btw, is a pretty common thing. I wonder what we could do to make 
sure that different architectures wouldn't have so different include file 
structures. It's happened _way_ too often.
Any ideas?
