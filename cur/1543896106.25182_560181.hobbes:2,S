Very poor example. In many parts of the world "Just quit" is "just starve
to death".
And guess what - brand owners do use the rights to try and stop that kind
of abuse with varying degrees of success. The 'fair trade' logo is
controlled this way. Many companies do their best not to license
production of goods to sweat shops and child slaves. It's considered
morally correct and companies get pounded by the public and lose business
when they fail to police these restrictions.
So please DON'T equate the two. Tivo is a minor control argument about a
silly little TV recording box. Employee rights is a matter of life, death
and slavery for many many people.
