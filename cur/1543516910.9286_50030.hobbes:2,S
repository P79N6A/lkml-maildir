While trying my second NIC in my PPC I saw an error msg which didn't
happen before.
a ping to x.x.x.1 the first NIC shows:
64 bytes from x.x.x.1 icmp_seq=y ttl=255 time=1.0ms
ping: recvfrom: Unknown error 512
The same on x.x.x.3, the second NIC.
A ping to a second machine, the same result, except time is about 27ms.
The two machines are connected over a Hub.
back on the x.x.x.1 time grows to 27ms, same on x.x.x.3
I had only a 2.2.13 final kernel to compare, here I don't see this. The
2.2.14pre7 & 8 shows the situation described above. Earlier kernels I
don't have handy now. 
Ahh, a pre4 seems to be ok too.
Is this kernel related? Or glibc?
Sorry if this topic has been discused before, if?
Thanks
Andreas
