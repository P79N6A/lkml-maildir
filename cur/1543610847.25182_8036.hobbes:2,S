Would you try 2.4.2 ?  Some ide-pci code related with promise were
changed between 2.4.2 and 2.4.10. I also had a problem in 2.4.10 
with promise.
But I needed to run 2.4.10, because 2.4.10 support promise 100tx2
(pdc20268 chip). 2.4.2 dosen't suport promise 100tx2. I had to
edit ide-pci code. It works with no problem, but I'm not sure
it is correct. If you want to run >2.4.10, I will send you diffs.
