Hello,
oh and before I forget about this:
        Turn SATA in Bios to compatibility mode And don't forget about
        the following kernel patch: Otherwise you don't have a disk
        after the resume. But the buffer cache is still there. ;-)

and yes, it is currently no fun to run a t60 under linux but it can only
get better.
