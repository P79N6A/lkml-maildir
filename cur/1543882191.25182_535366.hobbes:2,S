Yeah, I think it possibly is. But I don't think that much of the
vm should need to be touched at all, especially not mmap. And I
think only those filesystems interested in supporting it would
have to implement it (maybe a couple), not all of them.
I didn't run into all the issues you mentioned yet, and I don't
see why it would have to turn into a real (traditional) buffer
cache layer rather than just a Linux (ie. block mapping) buffer
layer.

But this seems to be due to your final IO request size, rather than
the number of sg entries the card has to process, right? My point
is that MMUs and the whole memory and data transfer system is quite
likely to be optimised for 4K pages, so it would be strange to think
that an IO card could not do that.
Why do we limit drivers to 128 sg entries?
