Subject: [PATCH] stop null ptr deference in __alloc_pages
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Summary: Avoid null ptr defererence in __alloc_pages
This exists in 2.4. and 2.5
Configuration: a NUMA (ia32) system which only has highmem 
on one or more nodes.
Action to create: Try to allocate ZONE_NORMAL memory 
from a node which only has highmem. What we should do
is fall back to another node, looking for ZONE_NORMAL
memory.
In looking at the specified zonelist, we panic because that zonelist
is NULL. The simple patch below avoids the null deference, and 
returns failure. alloc_pages will continue looking through the nodes
until it finds one with some ZONE_NORMAL memory. We actually
panic at the moment a few lines later when we do,
classzone->need_balance = 1; thus dereferencing the pointer.
