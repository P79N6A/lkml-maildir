of cause this helps ... thank you :)
we know now, that there are pci setting which affect the behavior in
relation fot audio playback.
as far as i know on some boards it could be, that the system bus hangs for
a short time, when the cpu is reconnected after a disconnect. it looks
like some caching for the pci bus could "cure" the sound skips which
happens when the system bus hangs for a short time.
so everyone who has problems with his audio and vidio playback while the
diconnect patch is active should look at his bios settings ... maybe he
could activate this pci master read cashing and his problems went away.
hmmm ... by the way: i could not reproduce your experiences, cause i have
no bios siwtch for pci master read cashing ...
oh ... and the pci delayed transaction could be dangerous on older via
chipsets cause the famous soutbridge bug in combination with an sound
blaster card. so be carefull if you have a sound blaster live  ....
