Yes, already identified that there are more updatedb's around. We are using 
"Secure Locate" and others simply the locate from the GNU findutils. Either 
version does not itself use significant memory though and seems irrelevant 
to the orginal swap-prefetch issue -- if updatedb filled memory with inodes 
and dentries the memory is no longer free and swap-prefetch can't prefetch 
anything.
The remaining issue of updatedb unnecessarily blowing away VFS caches is 
being discussed (*) in a few thread-branches still running.
