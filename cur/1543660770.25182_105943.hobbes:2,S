I have an Adaptec 2940AU which has worked perfectly with 2.4.18,
2.4.19, 2.4.20, including various pre and rc trees.  The only problem
I've had recently was 2.4.19-pre1, which has a known compile issue,
which was fixed in 2.4.19-pre2.  The 2.5.x tree has worked fine with
my 2940AU for months.
So, it's not a general problem with the adaptec driver.
John.
