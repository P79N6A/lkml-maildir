This will break glibc's OS version checks.  It won't show up as a problem
now, since it's mostly used to ignore versions of libraries which are
too new for the running kernel, and 2.6.8.1 is as new as it gets.  But
that code is going to think the version is humongously greater than
2.6.8 and 2.6.9.
