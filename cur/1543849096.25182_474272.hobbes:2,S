I ran out of privileged ports due to treemounting on /net from about 50
servers. The autofs program map for this uses the "showmount" command and
that one apparently uses privileged ports too (buried inside RPC client
libs part of glibc IIRC). The combination broke autofs and a number of
other services because there were no privileged ports left anymore.
So it can happen in practice.

Increasing the privileged port range in the kernel might be doable in
some cases. It might be useful to extend it to include port 2049 too.
