[this is sliding OT]
# MaxKeepAliveRequests: The maximum number of requests to allow

(what "high" means is the question here, I believe)

There's a timeout (15 sec, by default), which kicks idle clients away.
I guess it depends on the kind of load. If you're serving just static pages,
I agree. If you're serving dynamic pages via SQL queries (expecially with
authenticated connection), "session" setup cost may dominate.
Anyway, it's the "extraordinarily bad" part that I don't get.
Say we set MaxKeepAliveRequests to 190 (~2/3 of 256) instead of 1000.
How many requests does a client perform before it hits the 15 sec idle
timer?  Is it 189? The apache process is stuck in the timeout phase
anyway. Is it 191? Then the first apache process drops the keepalive
connection, the client reconnects to a second server process, which
is stuck again in the timeout phase. Or am I missing something?
