Actually this would be ideal for our situation because we're
developing on the PPC and we'd need make porting the profiling code as
easy as possible.  The less we have to do, the better.  Perhaps this
could become a part of future kernels?  I can see lots of situations
where having a handle on kernel performance would be cool without
having to apply patches to do it each time... :-)  Better to just
config it in as needed.
Regards,
 Robert.
