Probably, it breaks swiotlb with devices that don't have
DMA_64BIT_MASK coherent_dma_mask.

Hmm, platform_dma_alloc_coherent is supposed to handle multiple dma
ops, swiotlb, hardware IOMMUs like VT-d and sba, etc?
In IA64, the gfp zone flag matters for only swiotlb, I think.

Subject: [PATCH] IA64: use GFP_DMA in dma_alloc_coherent only when necessary
For swiotlb, we need to set GFP_DMA if a device doesn't have
DMA_64BIT_MASK coherent_dma_mask. hardware IOMMUs like VT-d and sba
should ignore gfp zone flag.
