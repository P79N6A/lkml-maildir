It's your code and it's your choice.
(But note that you contributed to then dual-licenced code in the
 OpenBSD CVS and kept this code dual-licenced. For this code your
 contributions might be assumed dual-licenced.)

Full agreement (for not dual-licenced code).

The email of Theo that was forwarded to linux-kernel [1] centered around 
Theo telling people that picking one licence for Sam's dual-licenced 
code would "break the law".
He would have better made the mistake in Jiri's patch visible (and 
therefore better defended your copyright) if he wouldn't have obscured 
it with these pointless accusations...

To clarify this myth once again:
The patch that mistakenly changed BSD-only code to GPL has never ever 
been in the Linux tree.
