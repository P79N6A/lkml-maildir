I often get these kinds of problems with semi-old HD's (UDMA33) when I run
*anything* else than DMA enabled (like when I run stuff like
hdparm -c1 -m16 -u1). It could also be a hard drive reporting the wrong
capabilities to the IDE controller.
A "hdparm /dev/hdX" and "hdparm -I /dev/hdX" would be most helpful to
diagnose your problem.
