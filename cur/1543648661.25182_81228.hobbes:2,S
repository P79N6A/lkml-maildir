LSM being an interface, it doesn't provide that. LSM's objective is to 
provide modules with the ability to mediate access to major internal 
kernel objects by user processes.
The security modules, in turn, use this ability to mediate to access to 
objects to implement some specific stated security property, and you 
would have to audit the module's code.
Some simple properties in the OWLSM module (porting some of the 
properties from the Openwall patch, and adding some more):
    * root may not follow non-root symlinks in certain circumstances
      (prevent some temp file attacks)
    * non-root may not create a hard-link to root-owned files in certain
      circumstances (prevent some other temp file attacks)
    * may not ptrace root processes (preventing further recurrance of
      the bugs in ptrace over the last year or so)
These policies help a lot to secure a system. But these policies also 
break some things, so it is good that they be a loadable module, and not 
a proposed Linux patch.

We took a system protected with SubDomain to Defcon and kicked ass 
http://news.com.com/2100-1001-948404.html?tag=rn
That was a 2.2 version of SubDomain. SubDomain is in the process of 
being ported to the 2.4 back-patch version of LSM.

The SELinux and DTE modules provide a similar form of security, but with 
different trade-offs between expressivenes and complexity. *Not* forcing 
a specific choice in this space on users was a major reason Linus 
rejected SELinux as a patch, and instead suggested enhancing the module 
interface.
There is GOBS of evidence that mandatory access control enhances 
security. But there is also gobs of evidence that mandatory access 
control is a huge pain in the ass to manage, leading to a huge plethora 
of different access control models. Being able to choose your model to 
suit your needs & circumstances, or choose none at all, was another 
reason for implementing an interface instead of a specific set of features.
