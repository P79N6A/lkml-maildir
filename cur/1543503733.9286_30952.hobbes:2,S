   He-he... Looking at do_proc_dointvec was enough for me to forget about
   idea to create our own private functions 8)8)
   BTW do you know that we used sysctl absolutely incorrectly?
   No sys/net variables define "strategy" method, hence sysctl() does not work
   at all. To be more exact, it does not any checks or transformations.
   Grr... What sad discovery... :( I make such discoveries not every day 8)
You don't have to define a strategy method; there is a default
behaviour.  If the sysctl entry in question reflects the contents of an
integer variable or some other fixed-length data, the default behaviour
is to copy the the information to the userspace program, which will do
the right thing.
