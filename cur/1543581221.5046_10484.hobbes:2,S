A few points:
* set your tabs to 8, and indent by 8 characters.
* Nastemi_auto_negociate: remove the 'static' variable - what if someone
has multiple cards installed?
* You cannot wait for for more than a few dozend microseconds in an
hardware interrupt handle, and a few hundred microseconds in a bottom
half handler (e.g a timer)
Probably the autonegotiation takes longer - add a timer that calls you
back after 50 milliseconds, and return.
And are you sure that a full reset is required for a simple link change?
Most other drivers are written the other way around:
tx_timeout() performs the full reset if the transmitter is hung for > 2
seconds, and link_change only changes the chip configuration.
