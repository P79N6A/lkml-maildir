I present loudly and proudly (I *don't* complain):

So, we had some ISO8859-1 and some UTF-8 in there already. (And as for 
MODULE_AUTHOR, it should stay there - 'fix' modinfo instead.)
BTW, there's also still a ton of non-UTF-8 in the kernel; I've already
fixed that weeks ago and sent some patch to trivial@, Adrian -
did you receive it?
