There's also likely to be another use of exactly the same type of thing
- the acall patches from Zach. At least my vision of the punt-to-thread
approach would be very similar: grab an available thread and attach it
to a given IO context.
So while I did mention exactly what Fabio outlines in my initial mail on
this, a generic way to attach/detach IO contexts from processes/threads
would be useful outside of this project. nfsd comes to mind as well.
