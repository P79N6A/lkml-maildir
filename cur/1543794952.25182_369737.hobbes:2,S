The patch didn't help.

davem recently merged a patch which adds ext3 ioctls to fs/compat_ioctl.c. 
That required inclusion of ext3 and jbd header files.  Those files explode
unpleasantly when CONFIG_JBD=n.
No trivial fix was apparent - perhaps we should disable the compat wrappers
if CONFIG_EXT3=n and/or CONFIG_JBD=n.
