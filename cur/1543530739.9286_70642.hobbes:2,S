OOM ==> killall. Great. I'd prefer the most stupid heuristic for finding
hogs anyday.

It is very easy to implement, kernelwise: Count how much is free, if <
threshold, kill(3) all processes. Problem is, very few (if any at all)
programs are prepared to handle this, let alone sanely. It is very easy to
decree that "non essential memory allocations should be shed now", it is
quite another to really do so, one application at a time, for a full
distribution. And you'll find out that the oportunities to do this are
severely limited in most programs, unless they are redesigned from the
ground up. Even deallocating memory that won't be used anymore isn't done
right as it stands today (memory leaks anyone?  ;). Perhaps if everything
uses garbage collection you could force garbage collection on SIGDANGER,
but that is less (time-average) than what you get by deallocating when not
using anymore.
