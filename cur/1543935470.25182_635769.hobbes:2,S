In your changelog comments you have this:
V1->V2
 - ...
V2->V3
- ...
But that really belongs below the "end-of-changelog" comment as this info
is relevant only for this submission to lkml and not in whats get committed.
As your submission did not include an RFC I assume this is expected to be 
the final version.
