Andrew,
I can not contact with Len for several days, while the oops on battery 
seems quite important.
It also seem to behave well in -mm tree (as part of Len's acpi-test).
Will you send this patch to Linus without approval from Len or should I?
Thanks,
Alex.

ACPI: Battery: remove cycle from battery removal.
From: Alexey Starikovskiy <astarikovskiy@suse.de>
get_property() should not call battery_update() on absent battery to
avoid cycle and oops.
