Translators on directories are a combo of automount+userland
filesystem, with the addition on having them saved in the mounted-on
filesystem.  Rather nice actually.  Replacing /etc/fstab with
local-to-the-mountpoint information has some charm.  I'm not sure if
translator-on-files actually exist.
Note that in hurd all filesystems are userland.  Whether it is a good
thing is left as an exercise to the benchmarker and the deadlock
chaser.
  OG.
