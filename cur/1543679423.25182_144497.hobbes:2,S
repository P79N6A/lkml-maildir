the CC: list I would have read it via my non-lkml account and therefore

On ones that don't we use the x86's existing facilities for doing
this, ioperm() and direct I/O instructions.
These issues are platform dependant for other reasons anyways
(endianness, barrier instructions needed, etc.)
But everything the most demanding testcase in userspace needs (this
being xfree86) needs can be done with the existing facilities.
Unlike other people, I do not see the value in having 50 ways to
do the same thing. :-)
