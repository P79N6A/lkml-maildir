Subject: linux-next: Tree for December 17

Precedence: bulk

Hi all,
Changes since 20081216:
Undropped tree:
	v4l-dvb
	lblnet
Dropped trees (temporarily):
	scsi (build problem)
	mtd (build problems)
	semaphore-removal (due to unfixed conflicts against Linus' tree)
	cpu_alloc (build problem)
	perfmon3 (concerns from the x86 team)
	nommu (build problem)
	boot-params (build problems)
	audit (difficult conflicts)
The pci tree lost its conflict.
The net tree lost a conflict.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have created today's linux-next tree at
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/sfr/linux-next.git
(patches at
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/sfr/linux-next/
).  If you
are tracking the linux-next tree using git, you should not use "git pull"
to do so as that will try to merge the new linux-next release with the
old one.  You should use "git fetch" as mentioned in the FAQ on the wiki
(see below).
You can see which trees have been included by looking in the Next/Trees
file in the source.  There are also quilt-import.log and merge.log files
in the Next directory.  Between each merge, the tree was built with
a ppc64_defconfig for powerpc and an allmodconfig for x86_64. After the
final fixups (if any), it is also built with powerpc allnoconfig,
44x_defconfig and allyesconfig (minus CONFIG_PROFILE_ALL_BRANCHES) and
i386, sparc and sparc64 defconfig.
Below is a summary of the state of the merge.
We are up to 133 trees (counting Linus' and 15 trees of patches pending for
Linus' tree), more are welcome (even if they are currently empty).
Thanks to those who have contributed, and to those who haven't, please do.
Status of my local build tests will be at
http://kisskb.ellerman.id.au/linux-next
 .  If maintainers want to give
advice about cross compilers/configs that work, we are always open to add
more builds.
Thanks to Jan Dittmer for adding the linux-next tree to his build tests
at 
http://l4x.org/k/
 , the guys at 
http://test.kernel.org/
 and Randy
Dunlap for doing many randconfig builds.
There is a wiki covering stuff to do with linux-next at
http://linux.f-seidel.de/linux-next/pmwiki/
 .  Thanks to Frank Seidel.
