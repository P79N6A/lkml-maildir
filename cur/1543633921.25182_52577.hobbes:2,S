   This part of the patch (the change to kernel/sched.c) can be safely	
   removed without making o1 stop working.
If Ingo's changes to remove the "frozen" stuff is installed, the
kernel is going to hang when you hit the deadlock condition on
sparc64.  Unless I'm mistaken, the "frozen" stuff had been removed.
You are going to hit this deadlock which I mentioned in another thread
on this list when Ingo mentioned that he had removed the "frozen"
locking I added because it causes other problems.
