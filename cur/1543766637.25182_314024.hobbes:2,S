Yeah, after giving it some additional thought, I think there are better ways.

Ok, here's a new idea.
For many devices "->suspend" and "->resume" with pm_message_t is exactly what
we need.  However, as we support more advanced power management features, such
as runtime power management, or power containers, we need something a little
more specific.  The exact power state must be specified among other issues.
We might do something like this:
Keep "->suspend" and "->resume" around unchanged. (so the states would
probably remain as PMSG_FREEZE and PMSG_SUSPEND).  If the driver doesn't
support the more advanced PM methods just use these.  They work well enough
for system sleep states etc.
Alternatively drivers could support a more rich power management interface
via the following methods:
change_state - changes a device's power state
change_state(struct device * dev, pm_state_t state, struct system_state * sys_state, int reason);  
@dev - the device
@state - the target device-specific power state
@sys_state - a data structure containing information about the intended global system power state
@reason - why the state must be changed (ex. RUNTIME_PM, SYSTEM_SLEEP, SYSTEM_RESUME, etc.)
halt - acts somewhat like PMSG_FREEZE, stops device activity, doesn't change power state
halt(struct device * dev, struct system_state * sys_state, int reason);
@dev - the device
@sys_state - a data structure containing information about the intended global system power state
@reason - why we are halting operation (ex. RUNTIME_CHANGES (like cpufreq), SYSTEM_SLEEP, SHUTDOWN, REBOOT)  
contine - resumes from a "halt"
continue(struct device * dev, struct system_state * sys_state, int reason);
@dev - the device
@sys_state - a data structure containing information about the intended global system power state
@reason - why we are resuming operation (ex. RUNTIME_CHANGES (like cpufreq), SYSTEM_RESUME)  
When changing system state, we call "change_state" for every device with power
resources.  Devices that do not directly consume power or have power states
will not implement "change_state" so we will call "halt" and "continue"
instead.
When shutting down the system, halt has the option of turning off the device,
as it will see the SHUTDOWN reason.  So it's a driver-knows-best approach
instead of assuming everything must be turned off, or everything must just be
stopped.
So in theory, with cpufreq, we could stop userspace, ->halt every device
(drivers won't do anything if they know it's not necessary), change the
frequency, and then resume operation.
We may want to create structures like pm_message_t for "change_state", "halt",
and "continue".  Pavel, do you have any thoughts on this?
This is just a rough idea... I look forward to any comments or suggestions.
Thanks,
Adam
