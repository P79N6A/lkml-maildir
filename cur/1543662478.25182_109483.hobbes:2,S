I think you're misreading the code...
The problem with the starfire is that you can only wrap the ring after the 
_first_ descriptor in a SG skbuff. That's why the code is more complicated 
than it would otherwise be.

Again, I think you're misinterpreting the 4 (which is, as I mentioned, 
hardcoded and somewhat arbitrary).
All I'm doing there is making sure there are at least 4 slots available 
before waking up the Tx queue. Why? because otherwise you might end up not 
having enough slots free for all the descriptors needed for a SG skbuff.
Otherwise, the Becker-style cur_tx <-> dirty_tx handling is in effect, and 
works as expected.

Because there aren't any? :-)
There were two big problems in the old driver:
- it was still using the Becker-era tx_full flag, which was non-atomic and 
therefore had a race between start_tx and intr_handler.
- it was failing to stop the DMA engines on ifdown, which could end up 
corrupting random memory (also inherited from the Becker driver)
The reason all the Tx handling has changed is due to the 64-bit support. 
The starfire does have a SG descriptor, but it can only handle 32-bit 
buffers. If you want 64-bit, you have to use chained single-buffer 
descriptors. So I just changed the code to always use chained 
single-buffer descriptors, for both 32-bit and 64-bit buffers -- but 
that's again the reason the driver now reserves more than one slot before 
turning Tx back on.

The alternative is a lot of #ifdef's all over the place. Thanks but no 
thanks, I'm no fan of typedef's but ifdef's are worse.

Well, you didn't say much at the time... :-) so I just assumed you were 
mostly happy with it.
Thanks,
Ion
