Hi!
Hum, sending mails after midnight is prone for typos... I meant 2.4.15 
not 14...
If you have a closer look, you'll realize that the -pre7+ version only 
calls init_special_inode if there is no fileops structure in dir entry. 
alsa sets this entry always, resulting in wrong chardev entries in the 
/proc hierarchy
