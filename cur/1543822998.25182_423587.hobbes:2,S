Interesting approach. Did you actually find any leaks with this? 
What looks a bit dubious is how objects reuse is handled. You can't
distingush an reused object from an old leaked pointer. But due
to the way slab allocates this should be pretty common. I guess
for your approach to be effective slab would need to be changed
to a queue?
