Which is why 2.5.1 is the only time it can go in.
It would save 140K compressed (bz2) which kernel.org
would probably appreciate, but it's probably too late
already so the next best is always do it for subsequent patches.
Perhaps their should be a patch_pp script that does runs
both Lindent and strip_ws? Actually Alan Cox mentioned to
me that pine had a bug where it stripped whitespace at end
of lines :-) can't depend on that though.
