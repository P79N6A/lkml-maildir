CAP_SYS_RAWIO is needed to do arbitary patching/loading in the capability
model so if you are using lesser capabilities it is a (minor) capability
rise but not a big problem, just ugly and wanting a fix

Can you count the number needed, preallocate them and then when you know
for sure either succeed or fail the operation as a whole ?
