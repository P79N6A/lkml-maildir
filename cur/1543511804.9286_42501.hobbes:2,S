    That's what G-d invented symbolic links for.
    The kernel exports policy no matter what;  currently it exports
    policy via major and minor numbers, which someone has to root
    through source code and/or documentation to find and then link your
    namespace to, and with devfs it exports policy via a bunch of names
    that you can link your namespace to.
    The _one_ difference between the two schemes is where permissions
    and ownership are applied;   with block and character devices, you
    apply ownership and permissions to the link, and with symbolic links
    you apply ownership and permissions to the file.   
                  ____
    david parsons \bi/ and with the devfsd hack, you get your ownership
                   \/  persistance via the much-loved userspace bloat.
