I've already answered Paul Menage about this. Shortly:
... I agree that some users may want to create some
kind of "persistent" beancounters, but this must not be
the only way to control them...
... I think that we may have something [like this] - a flag
BC_PERSISTENT to keep beancounters with zero refcounter in
memory to reuse them...
... I have nothing against using configfs as additional,
optional interface, but I do object using it as the only
window inside BC world...
