Yes, it is about 98-100% in both cases.
I've just re-run tests on my amd64 test machine without debug options:
epoll		4794.23
kevent		6468.95
here are full client 'ab' outputs for epoll and kevent servers (epoll 
does not contain EPOLLET as you requested, but it does not look like 
it change performance in my case).

Notice how percentage of the requests served within a certain time
differs for kevent and epoll. And this server does not include
ready-on-submission kevent optimization.
