The problem with -rc is that there are two types of people :
  - the optimists who think "good, it's already rc. I'll download it and
    run it as soon as it's released"
 - the pessimists who think "I killed my machine twice with rc, let's leave
   it to other brave testers".
These two problems are solvable with the same solution : no rc anymore.
I agree with Ted. A version every week or 2 weeks is good. People will
run random versions, some will report problems, others not. After that,
you know the differences between exact releases, you don't have to parse
28 MB changes. And you can also ask them to upgrade or downgrade and
quickly find where the bug entered.
Others will find stable versions they will want to stick to for some time,
which would also improve the bugs detection. At the time of 2.1, there were
many people using it because there were known stable versions (thanks to
Alan, btw). I remember having run an NFS server on 2.1.131-ac13 which was
fast an rock solid at this time.
Today's -rc system slows down testing. I also look at 2.4 : people only
test 2.4 when there is a new release. Between releases, very few people
such Adrian and a few others recompile a full kernel and report problems.
When you don't have much free time, you don't want to spend it testing
pre-releases which you think did not change from the previous one.

if it's 2-3 days, it's reasonnable I think. It should let some people
report build problems just before the real one.
