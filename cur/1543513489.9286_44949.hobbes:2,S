Yes. I have this problem as  well, using the current grub version. (LILO
sucks). 
And  I have  a  fix which  is not  actually  mine. The  fix was  already
necessary  for 2.2.13pre18  AFAICS  and  had been  posted  to this  list
before.  I made a  patch from  the 2.2.13pre  reports, find  it attached
below. Use: export/save this mail, cd /usr/src/linux ; patch <this-mail
Alan, why haven't  these gone into 2.2.13 after  pre18 already had these
troubles reportedly?  It's  not a good idea forcing  2.2.13 out if there
are reported breaking issues to the last -preXX version.
I appreciate good  testing, but I am very  incontent with getting 2.2.13
that does not even boot. This issue WAS reported and it SHOULD HAVE BEEN
addressed.
