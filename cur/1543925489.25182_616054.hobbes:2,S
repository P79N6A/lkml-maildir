The K64BIT varibale came up because it is more unique than CONFIG_64BIT.
Google turned up less than 20 hits[1] on K64BIT but 14900 on CONFIG_64BIT.
And I dunno if some people source their .config or other crazy stuff.
And then K64BIT was easier to type...
But if we assume this is internal stuff only then we could go
for the longer version and I will then suggest to prefix
the CONFIG_ symbol with K like in KCONFIG_64BIT which
has no hits with google right now!
I do not see this extended to 'any' CONFIG_ symbol
but maybe the 4 most important ones.
[64BIT, SMP, PREEMPT, ?]
[1] before my posting - now we are up to ~80.
