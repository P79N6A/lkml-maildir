Well I really don't want to mediate, but even in the case of a
completely MIA maintainer, that isn't really a good idea to throw out
working and useful code.
But last time this discussion came up, IIRC you ended up handwaving
about all the ways in which SLOB was broken but didn't actually come
up with any real problems. Matt seemed willing to add those counters
or whatever it was if/when doing so solved a real problem. And remember
that SLOB doesn't have to have feature parity with SLUB, so long as it
implements the slab API such that the kernel *works*.
