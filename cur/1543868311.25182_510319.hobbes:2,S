 - filesystems A and B
 - write to A will end up as write to B
 - dirty pages in A manage to go over dirty_threshold
 - page writeback is started from A
 - this triggers writeback for a couple of pages in B
 - writeback finishes normally, but dirty+writeback pages are still
   over threshold
 - balance_dirty_pages in B gets stuck, nothing ever moves after this
At least this is my theory for what happens.
