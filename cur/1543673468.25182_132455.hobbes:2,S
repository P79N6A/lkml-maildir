I'm working on it. Consider it bundled in the long rant that Andrew
quoted concerning an atomic "open()". By allowing filesystems to
replace most of what is currently contained in open_namei() (and doing
it atomically instead of relying on local semaphores for atomicity)
it will be possible to implement O_EXCL (and to do it efficiently)...
Cheers,
