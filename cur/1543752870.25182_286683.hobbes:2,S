Your "secondly" is bogus.
Sure, you can do that, and if you do that, then the world recognizes you 
for what you are - nothing but a publicity-seeking creep.
THAT is why vendor-sec is bad. It allows publicity-seeking creeps to take 
on the mantle of being "good".
I'm arguing for exposing them for what they are. If that hurts some 
feelings, tough ;)

You ignore reality.
It's not a one- or two-week delay. Once the vendor-sec mentality takes 
effect, the delay inevitably grows. You _always_ have excuses for 
delaying, and as shown by this thread, a _lot_ of people believe them.
Also, even a one- or two-week delay _is_ actually detrimental. It means 
that you can't handle the problem when it happens, so it gets queued up. 
People cannot inform unrelated third parties about their patches (because 
they are embargoed), which means that they get out of sync, and suddenly 
the thing that open source is so good at - namely making communication 
work well - becomes a problem.

The spam-viruses clearly show that that isn't always true, though. The 
advantage to targeting the whole infrastructure _is_ clearly there.
