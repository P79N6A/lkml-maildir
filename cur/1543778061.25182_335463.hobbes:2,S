I'm concerned about reducing the potential data loss (if the user
doesn't resume) to nil, so I'd argue that it's important.

In the case of Suspend2, if we let the call continue, we are potentially
overwriting valid data. I think that's important enough for a BUG_ON. I
don't add them lightly!

In the middle of setting the flag or in the middle of the routine? If
we're preempted prior to setting the flag, get refrigerated and don't
continue with the call until post resume (can this happen?), it won't
matter.

Ok. I'll wait to see the feedback from Greg before sending to Al.
Hopefully he'll either convince me I'm wrong or tell Pavel he's wrong.
Whatever the case, if Greg says no, I'll not bother anymore with
submitting it - even if I still disagree.
