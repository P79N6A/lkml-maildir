There's no no point in keeping documentation for a driver that was 
removed many years ago.

-This is the README for the Gracilis Packetwin device driver, version 0.5
-ALPHA for Linux 1.3.43.
-
-These files will allow you to talk to the PackeTwin (now know as PT) and
-connect through it just like a pair of TNCs.  To do this you will also
-require the AX.25 code in the kernel enabled.
-
-There are four files in this archive; this readme, a patch file, a .c file
-and finally a .h file.  The two program files need to be put into the
-drivers/net directory in the Linux source tree, for me this is the
-directory /usr/src/linux/drivers/net.  The patch file needs to be patched in
-at the top of the Linux source tree (/usr/src/linux in my case).
-
-You will most probably have to edit the pt.c file to suit your own setup,
-this should just involve changing some of the defines at the top of the file. 
-Please note that if you run an external modem you must specify a speed of 0.
-
-The program is currently setup to run a 4800 baud external modem on port A
-and a Kantronics DE-9600 daughter board on port B so if you have this (or
-something similar) then you're right.
-
-To compile in the driver, put the files in the correct place and patch in
-the diff.  You will have to re-configure the kernel again before you
-recompile it. 
-
-The driver is not real good at the moment for finding the card.  You can
-'help' it by changing the order of the potential addresses in the structure
-found in the pt_init() function so the address of where the card is is put
-first.
-
-After compiling, you have to get them going, they are pretty well like any
-other net device and just need ifconfig to get them going.
-As an example, here is my /etc/rc.net

-
-This version of the driver comes under the GNU GPL.  If you have one of my
-previous (non-GPL) versions of the driver, please update to this one.
-
-I hope that this all works well for you.  I would be pleased to hear how
-many people use the driver and if it does its job.
