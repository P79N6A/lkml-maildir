the cost is different on SMP and UP. On SMP the full 'user-visible' cost
of handling an interrupt is around 4-5 usecs. (pretty much stable across
CPUs and boards) On UP it's 8-10 usecs. I'd do the IRQ thing because even
if it turns out to be marginally slower, it's a more robust design and IRQ
latency is expected to get better and better with future boards. (and also
we are pretty much close to using the APIC for UP too, as we already do
for the Visual Workstation)
