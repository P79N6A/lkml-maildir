The bug we trigger is an ld bug - not a compiler bug.
What happens is that we have the same function defined weak twice.
In fs/ we include binfmt_elf.o in the build because
CONFIG_BINFMT_ELF is set.
And in arch/powerpc/kernel/binfmt_elf32.c:
we do an: #include "../../../fs/binfmt_elf.c"
Without actually trying it out I assume we trigger the ld bug
because we define the same weak function twice.
And this is a non-typical situation.
