It would be best if everyone tested each card individually right now,
both PCI and AGP versions should work.
I think I know of a couple places where it might break if multiple
cards are used simultaneously. All static variables in the core are
suspect and need to be individually checked. There are less than 20 so
it shouldn't take too long. Of course any help with this is
appreciated.
Another thing that isn't written is splitting the module parameters
between the core and personalities. I'll also switch syntax from 2.4
style to 2.6 style. When finished each module with have a debug=1
parameter and the core will also have a cards_limit which defaults to
16.
This version also includes minor number reuse so hotplugging a card
in/out won't exhaust the DRM minors.
