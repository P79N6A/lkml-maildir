there shouldn't be many ifdefs left, AGP and MTRR, if you re building a
binary driver for x86 you can assume the platform has AGP and MTRR and the
kernel should sort it all out, the remaining macros are mainly for
building on Alpha and Sparc...

it'll be big but that's the same as we have now as I said, I believe the
balance between having a common library with an extensive new binary
interface, vs the un-common use case of using two different graphics card
in one PC is worth having the library in eeach driver, the binary
interface needs to be avoided at all costs, and I believe Keith's opinion
is worth listening to on binary interfaces :-)

Again that is a bit of a separate project, my thinking on all these
projects is that I can feed them into the kernel is small obvious changes
this change will probably just fall out at the end as obvious it isn't so
for me yet...
I'm willing to spend the time doing an initial implementation (as we all
know, code talks, I'm not sure what talking does :-)
Dave.
