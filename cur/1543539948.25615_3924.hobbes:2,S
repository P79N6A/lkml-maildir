Normally I'd go straight to the writer of the driver with this problem but 
he's anonymous, soo...
I've been getting the same hard freezes as a lot of people who are trying to 
use Neomagic nm256 audio. What's causing the lockups, at least on my Dell 
Latitude LS, is the ac97_codec driver trying to read (not write) a few 
standard AC97 registers. In particular anytime the AC97_RESET register 
(defined in ac97.h as 0x00) is accessed the machine instantly crashes. This 
also occurs for several other registers. Does anyone have any idea why this 
might be occuring? It's not like the driver is trying to _write_ to any 
memory - at least then the crashes would make a little bit of sense. Just 
reading those registers kills it. The Windows drivers for this chip work 
fine; I wish I knew a bit more about how to delve into the interals of 
Windows so I could see just how that driver finesses the AC97 registers 
without locking the machine. Is anyone aware of any sort of conflict that 
I'm missing here? Advice on how to proceed? Thanks!
