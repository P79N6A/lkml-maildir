BTW it probably does. Richard has other model than we do, that means
that 0.0.7 code was known to work on at least two models. Then there
was third person, I think he got thinkpad 600, who tried that too and
it worked for him (modulo some glitches, like interfering with his
pcmcia modem :-).
Surely jamie.c will not with anything that is not toshiba because it
has 0x1c00 portbase hardcoded. ltmodem-0.0.7 does not have that
problem.
