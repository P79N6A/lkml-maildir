I'm marking the kernel as tainted when we've suspended. It could
probably be dropped but I was erring on the side of paranoia.
As to the others, I'll be happy to explain how they're used and drop
them if necessary/possible. I agree about a couple. The keyboard sound
one, for example, slipped past my purge of some
report-progress-while-beeping code I inherited.
Regards,
Nigel

Many today claim to be tolerant. True tolerance, however, can cope with others
being intolerant.
