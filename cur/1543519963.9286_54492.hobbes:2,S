Can this occur?  sys_open() does
  lock_kernel()
  filp_open() -> module open code: does MOD_INC_USE_COUNT.
  unlock_kernel()
sys_delete_module() does
  lock_kernel()
  Test module in use.
  free_module()
  unlock_kernel()
AFAICT, both the module open routine and the module unloading code run
under the big kernel lock, no races are possible.
