Hi all,
I do hope this is the right forum.  I didn't see a "linux-kernel-build" list.
Anyway, I do not see an obvious way to construct an object archive library
that I wish to use for multiple drivers.  There are two problems.  This:
> ifeq ($(ARCH),ia64) 
> 	CFLAGS_KERNEL = 
> endif
because I am making the archive for a loadable driver.  This is not right
because I am digging around in kernel make files to figure out how to
do this and I'm guessing it might be subject to change.  :-}
The other "problem" is merely a nuisance:
> WARNING: Symbol version dump /usr/src/Kernel/SLES9/linux-2.6.5-7.97-debug/Module
> .symvers is  missing, modules will have CONFIG_MODVERSIONS disabled.
this, presumably, 'cuz I'm not actually making a module.
Your help is greatly appreciated.
Regards, Bruce
