Isnt there a way for userspace to somehow find this? It is a bit
annoying that main volume control in kmix doesnt work (and thus the one
in panel; also there is no headphone control there).
The other option would be to configure userspace which control is the
main one (but windows doesnt need that, so this solution would be
inferior). Eventually i will take a look what does the win driver (maybe
it sets main and headphone control always together). Until then i'd like
to hear what are our options .. since the current situation is not
really desirable.
Thanks for any ideas,
pkx
