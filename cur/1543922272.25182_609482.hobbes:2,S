The firewall blocks incoming connections where appropriate, yes, but it 
doesn't stop one user binding to a port that another user expected to be able 
to use. "Ownership" of ports (1-1023) shouldn't be something only root (via 
CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE) has. Lots of services also don't have standard ports 
below 1024 and it's useful to be able to prevent users from binding to them 
too.
