See, I _said_ it was a bogus measurement of performance!
It only measures the speed of a single delay loop.  That can be
profoundly affected by seemingly small details of the CPU's internal
implementation.  It has been known for the bogomips to almost double in
value after the insertion of a no-operation assembler instruction into
the delay loop: it just depends on how that affects the CPU pipeline.
