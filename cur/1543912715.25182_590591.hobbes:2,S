It looks like a nice cleanup to me.

Hmm.  I think this is bad.  
First, considering only the single-threaded case, there are debugger vs
SIGCONT races.  Someone does kill(pid,SIGSTOP);kill(pid,SIGCONT); while pid
is debugged.  The mandate for end user behavior here is that pid cannot
wind up sitting in job control stop in the end.  Say the debugger is
e.g. strace, simply printing every signal and passing it through.
So say it goes:
	T			K			D
	merrily running ...				blocked in wait4
				kill(K, SIGSTOP)
	dequeue SIGSTOP
	 -> ptrace_stop
 							wait4 -> K,{SIGSTOP}
				kill(K, SIGCONT)
							PTRACE_CONT,K,SIGSTOP
	do_signal_stop(SIGSTOP)
 							wait4 -> K,{SIGSTOP}
The debugger did the obvious thing: just pass through what it got.
The killer did something POSIX guarantees leaves T running.
T is in job control stop, with a pending SIGCONT (normally impossible).
It's not the end of the world, since the next SIGKILL or SIGCONT will
always wake it up.  But it's not right.
There are related issues with multi-threaded job control stop and with
suddenly killing the debugger.  I could get into those in detail.  But I
think the case above illustrates why we need a stop signal pending
consideration by the debugger to be like a stop signal pending locking for
the is_current_pgrp_orphaned() check when a SIGCONT/SIGKILL comes in between.
It's still probably a worthwhile cleanup to have the logic only in
get_signal_to_deliver, and to fix the problem you cited.  It will take only
a little extra code to handle the ptrace case too, i.e.
	if (sig_kernel_stop(signr) &&
 	    current->sighand->action[signr-1] == SIG_DFL &&
 	    !(current->signal->flags & SIGNAL_GROUP_EXIT))
		current->signal->flags |= SIGNAL_STOP_DEQUEUED;
	ptrace_stop(signr, signr, info);
	if (sig_kernel_stop(signr) && current->exit_code == signr &&
	    !(current->signal->flags & SIGNAL_STOP_DEQUEUED) &&
 	    current->sighand->action[signr-1] == SIG_DFL)
		current->exit_code = 0;
maybe.
Thanks,
Roland
