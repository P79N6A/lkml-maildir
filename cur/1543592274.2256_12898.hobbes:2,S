Hi all
                     Thanks for the reply David. I have done the full
installation of redhat6.2. But there is no support for mounting for ntfs file
system. When ever we write mount -t ntfs /dev..... it shows "ntfs not
supported by kernel". But when I went through the kernel source codes, there
is source code for ntfs. How to add the ntfs file driver to my kernel. Should
it need the full recompilation of the kernel codes
Thanks in advance
