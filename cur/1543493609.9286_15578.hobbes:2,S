I am getting the following error when i try to run make menuconfig on a
redhat 5.2 system  that has  all the needed file versions from the
changes file in the documentation for the 2.2.6 kernel.
There seems to be a problem with the lxdialog companion utility which is
built prior to running Menuconfig.  Usually this is an indicator that
you
have upgraded/downgraded your ncurses libraries and did not remove the
old ncurses header file(s) in /usr/include or /usr/include/ncurses.
It is VERY important that you have only one set of ncurses header files
and that those files are properly version matched to the ncurses
libraries
installed on your machine.
You may also need to rebuild lxdialog.  This can be done by moving to
the /usr/src/linux/scripts/lxdialog directory and issuing the
"make clean all" command.
If you have verified that your ncurses install is correct, you may email
the maintainer <mec@shout.net> or post a message to
<linux-kernel@vger.rutgers.edu> for additional assistance.
make: *** [menuconfig] Error 139
There have been no changes to the ncurses on this system and i can run
make menuconfig  on 2.2.5 without any problems.  i currently have
ncurses 4.2 on my system.  i did try to do the make clean all as the
message suggests to do.
I have found that if you take the file :
/usr/src/linux-2.2.6/scripts/lxdialog/lxdialog and replace it with the
file:   /usr/src/linux-2.2.5/scripts/lxdialog/lxdialog   you can get
make menuconfig on 2.2.6 to work.
I hope I have given you enough information to work  on this problem and
if i can be of
assistance please email me back.
