Ingo did a large bit of work wrt. mergeability, the for_each_task_pid()
macro, folded the separately allocated idtag structures into the task_t,
redid the pid allocator to handle thelarger spaces, and fixed several
severe bugs, so he should be given due credit. I'd say it was a
collaborative effort, though separated somewhat by the times we
actually worked on it.

Deep call stacks are not cheap on all arches, ISTR SPARC(64?) and S/390
having some relatively obscene overheads. Going iterative didn't
actually look that bad here, but sleeping etc. for memory weren't in
the picture for me.
