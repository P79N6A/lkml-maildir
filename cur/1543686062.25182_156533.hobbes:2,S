Hey, what a quick reply, here goes the info you asked for, if you need any
more just ask for it.
> - does 2.6.0-test3 detect the card at boot ?
>   - if not, what are the complete kernel messages ?
Yes and no, I mean, it detects a card, but not the card it has in, it tries
to load memory_cs when I have a wireless card in, the card should load
hostap_cs, in fact if after booting I remove it and insert it twice, it
recognices the card well and tries to load hostap_cs.
Here are the messages it outputs:
Linux Kernel Card Services 3.1.22

It always needs an even number of insertions.
> - does 2.4 and 2.6-test3 yenta find the same IRQs ?
Seems so, these are the messages for yenta on 2.4.21:
Linux Kernel Card Services 3.1.22
  options:  [pci] [cardbus] [pm]
PCI: Found IRQ 11 for device 01:09.0
PCI: Sharing IRQ 11 with 00:1d.1

0xe0000-0xfffff
> - which version of pcmcia-cs are you using with 2.4 ?
3.2.2
> - which IRQ(s) does 2.4 i82365 use ?
The same ones as yenta, here you have the messages I get with it just in
case:
Linux PCMCIA Card Services 3.2.2
  kernel build: 2.4.21 #1 Sat Jun 14 19:43:14 CEST 2003

    host opts [0]: [pci/way] [pci irq 10] [lat 32/176] [bus 2/5]
    ISA irqs (default) = 3,4,5,7 PCI status changes
Hope this helps, if you need anything else, just ask for it.
