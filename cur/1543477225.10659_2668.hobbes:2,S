Quite doubtful.  The French government is adicted to being able to spy on its
populace at will.  It also makes the US Government look "moderate" in its
crypto-legalism.  I would expect that it would take alot of outrage from the
French people and/or the EU to get them to change.  I don't see either
happening any time in the near future.
