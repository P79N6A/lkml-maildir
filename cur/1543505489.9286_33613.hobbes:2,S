i had a (similar?) problem on my single-cpu via-rhine box (not my SMP box 
which also has a via-rhine (only one nic in each)) where the driver would
claim something wicked had happened... The nic's link light would go out
at this time, I would unplug and replug the cable into the card and it
would "wake up" .. or if i waited long enough it would fix itself...  but
*whenever the network bandwidth got too high* - BANG! wicked! ... i have
not had this problem recently though - I have been toying with the pci
cards, perhaps simply moving it around fixed it?
