This looks very good!
ACPI team, any chance we can get this in the mainline?
We want to add a driver (for the asus atk0110 ACPI interface) to the hwmon 
subsys which talks to hwmon IC's through ACPI, but before we can do that we 
must make sure that potentially conflicting native IC drivers do not load.
Thanks & Regards,
Hans
