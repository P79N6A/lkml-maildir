The delta is not the object I care about and its representation is
arbitrary. In fact different branches will store different deltas
depending on how their DAGs get topologically sorted. The object I
care about is the original text, so that's the hash I store.

Well naturally, I hash the metadata too. For every change, there's a
toplevel changeset hash that is the hash of the entire project state
at that time. And it's all signable and so on. Just like git and just
like Monotone.
