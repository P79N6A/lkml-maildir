Yeah, but I expect it to be a timing problem, which may show up with a
new kernel. The kernel is maybe just that bit faster in the event
generation, that it triggers a silly HAL bug. You probably need:
  
http://gitweb.freedesktop.org/?p=hal.git;a=commit;h=f3e160d0ab85f62b76400cb521b4d1b5813d0711
It's all fine here regarding LUKS volumes, therefore I wouldn't know
what would be wrong at the kernel side.
