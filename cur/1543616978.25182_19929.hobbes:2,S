I checked the code ./drivers/net/8390.c - this is how it REALLY looks like...
	/* Ugly but a reset can be slow, yet must be protected */
		
	disable_irq_nosync(dev->irq);
	spin_lock(&ei_local->page_lock);
		
	/* Try to restart the card.  Perhaps the user has fixed something. */
	ei_reset_8390(dev);
	NS8390_init(dev, 1);
		
	spin_unlock(&ei_local->page_lock);
	enable_irq(dev->irq);
This should be mostly OK for the preemptive kernel. Swapping the irq and spin 
lock lines should be preferred. But I think that is the case in SMP too...
Suppose two processors does the disable_irq_nosync - unlikely but possible...
One gets the spinlock, the other waits
The first runs through the code, exits the spin lock, enables irq
The second starts running the code - without irq disabled!!!
This would work in both cases.
	/* Ugly but a reset can be slow, yet must be protected */
		
	spin_lock(&ei_local->page_lock);
	disable_irq_nosync(dev->irq);
		
	/* Try to restart the card.  Perhaps the user has fixed something. */
	ei_reset_8390(dev);
	NS8390_init(dev, 1);
		
	enable_irq(dev->irq);
	spin_unlock(&ei_local->page_lock);
