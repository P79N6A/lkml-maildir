Because the architecture review commitee decided this would be the right way.
Note that we are on a migration from the classical root/non-root UNIX to a fine 
grained privileges handling. The current documentation says that you need to 
have a profile enabled shell as your SHELL in order to be able to use a 
root-less Solaris.

But you are right that another way would be to use something like "isaexec"

This is something that needs to be discussed. Last night, I found that there 
should be a way to run cdrecord without the need to have the "file_dac_read"
provilege. I'll discuss this with the security group.
