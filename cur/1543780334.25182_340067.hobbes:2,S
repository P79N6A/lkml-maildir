nice theory. In practice gcc 3.x still adds up all the stack space
anyway and as long as gcc 3.x is a supported kernel compiler, you can't
depend on this. Also.. please favor readability. gcc is getting smarter
about stack use nowadays, and {}'s shouldn't be needed to help it, it
tracks liveness of variables already.
