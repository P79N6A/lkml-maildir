Do we ever use that, though?  Having to pass in the pointer, the size
and the area just to free memory, sure is a bitch.

drm_calloc calls kcalloc which performs an integer overflow check on the
'n' and 'size' arguments, which isn't needed for drm_zalloc.  Small
detail, of course, but I don't see the problem with aliasing to kzalloc.
