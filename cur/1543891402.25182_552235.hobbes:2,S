Did we use to BUG_ON()? I think that's wrong. There are ways for users to 
potentially ask the kernel to do big allocations, and the correct response 
is to say "no can do", not to crash!

Looks fine to me. My only comment is that

This could be micro-optimized (again, non-standard, but it should be 
"practically portable") to have just a single test using something like
	if ((unsigned long)x <= 16)
		return;
but I guess it doesn't really matter much.
I think this is better than what we have now, but I also suspect it's 
*not* something we should try this late in the -rc sequence ;)
Andrew, want to take this patch to -mm to see if it triggers anything?
