You can tell if it supports ipx, but you can't tell if it supports
it because you loaded a module or because it was compiled in.
`ls /proc/net/ipx*`  will show.......
           ipx ipx_interface ipx_route
... if you've got ipx enabled (somehow).
To find if it's enabled by a module, then you can then do:
`lsmod | grep ipx` if you found it was enabled.
