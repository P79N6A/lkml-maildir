argh, you made me look.
Really cache_line_size() should be implemented in include/linux/cache.h. 
Then we tromp the stupid private implementations in slob.c and slub.c.
Then we wonder why x86 uses a custom cache_line_size(), but still uses
L1_CACHE_BYTES for its L1_CACHE_ALIGN().
Once we've answered that, we look at your
+	/*
+	 * We should make sure each CPU gets private memory.
+	 */
+	size = roundup(size, cache_line_size());
and wonder whether it should have used L1_CACHE_ALIGN().
I think I'd better stop looking.
