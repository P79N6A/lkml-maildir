Yep, but unfortunately there is simply no other test available to us to
tell us how many mappings share the page.  For things like COW, we
_need_ that.
The only reason we can get away with it is that a false positive in
is_page_shared() is harmless.  A false negative would be disasterous
(we'd end up with writabe sharings of COW pages after a fork, leading to
applications corrupting each others' memory).  
As long as the mapping count is embedded in the page reference count, we
will not be able to rely on is_page_shared() 100%.
