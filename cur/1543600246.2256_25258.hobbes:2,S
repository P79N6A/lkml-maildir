Sorry, but that's not correct. I just ran a test, and the bug is
still there in 2.4.9-ac7. Maybe you're thinking of some other bug?
ide-tape tells me it uses a 14*26KB buffer for my Seagate STT8000A.
If I dd a 39KB (1.5 "buffer units") file with bs=1k to /dev/ht0 it tells
me it wrote 39 blocks. If I then rewind and dd with bs=1k from /dev/ht0
it only reads 26 blocks. The same happens in 2.2 + Hedrick's IDE patch.
2.2 vanilla reads 56 blocks, of which the first 39 are identical to
what I initially wrote. The last 13 contain junk but that's not a big
problem since I back up with tar which writes its own EOF mark.
