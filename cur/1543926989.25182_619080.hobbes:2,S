Instead of blabbering further about this topic, I decided to put my
code where my mouth is and spent the weekend porting the perfmon2
kernel bits, and the user bits (libpfm and pfmon) to sparc64.
As a result I've found that perfmon2 is quite nice and allows
incredibly useful and powerful tools to be written.  The syscalls
aren't that bad and really I see not reason to block it's inclusion.
I rescind all of my earlier objections, let's merge this soon :-)
