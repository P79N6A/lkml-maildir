KERNEL 2.6.8.1: Memory leak? CDrecord problem?
-----------------------------------
KERNEL 2.6.7: compiled cdrecord.
 Works fine. Burns data disks fine.
 Burns audio disks fine.
UPGRADED TO KERNEL 2.6.8.1 (using the patches):
 Used version of cdrecord compiled under 2.7
 Burns data disks fine.
 I have 256 Meg RAM (and 500+ Meg swap).
 Burning a 400+Meg wav file to audio CD (40+minute
 radio show) causes, after 130-180Meg have been
 burned (depending on what I am running):
   OUT OF MEMORY: closing down atd
  and memory keeps being used up:
 
   OUT OF MEMORY: closing down cupsd
   OUT OF MEMORY: closing down crond
   (etc.)
  
  If I am lucky, cdrecord gets closed down before
  something critical gets killed.
  Often I am unlucky.
UNDER KERNEL 2.6.8.1:
 Recompiled cdrecord under 2.6.8.1.
 Burns data disks fine.
 Burning a 400+ Meg wav file to audio CD causes:
   OUT OF MEMORY: closing down atd
   OUT OF MEMORY: closing down cupsd
   OUT OF MEMORY: closing down crond
   (etc.)
(Fedora Core1; kernel upgraded to (now) 2.6.7
               (I went back to 2.6.7 so I could
                burn audio CDs)
               Using Pioneer DVD burner with ATAPI
               (dev=ATAPI:0,0,0 in cdrecord) interface.)
