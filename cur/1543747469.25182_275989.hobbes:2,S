Modern ThinkPads have accelerometers in their hard drives that detect
sudden movement and spin down the drive or otherwise protect it.
The device is pretty basic, though, and you can just read it directly to
watch the movement of your laptop.  E.g., pick your laptop up and a
little icon in your GNOME panel can show an up arrow.  Pretty neat.
I am sure Google has more information.
