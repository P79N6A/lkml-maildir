Well, we certainly should, but do we always remeber about it?  Honest, guv?

It may help directly, for example when people realize that they work on
conflicting or just related changes.

I totally agree with that.
Still, the issue at hand is that
(1) The code merged during a merge window is somewhat opaque from the tester's
     point of view and if a regression is found, the only practical means to
    figure out what caused it is to carry out a bisection (which generally is
    unpleasant, to put it lightly).
(2) Many regressions are introduced during merge windows (relative to the
    total amount of code merged they are a few, but the raw numbers are
    significant) and because of (1) the process of removing them is generally
    painful for the affected people.
(3) The suspicion is that the number of regressions introduced during merge
    windows has something to do with the quality of code being below
    expectations, that in turn may be related to the fact that it's being
    developed very rapidly.
My opinion is that we need to solve this issue sooner rather than later and so
the question is how we are going to approach that.
Thanks,
Rafael
