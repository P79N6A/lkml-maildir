   POSIX says nothing, as far as I can tell, about the effect of exec on 
   threads. However, it does say pending signals must be inherited. It's
   unclear what should happen in Linux, but it might be good for the new
   process to still be a thread in the thread group -- although it won't
   be sharing memory anymore.
The current draft for IEEE Std. 1003.1-200x says:
"A call to any exec function from a process with more than one thread
 results in all threads being terminated and the new executable image
 being loaded and executed.  No destructor functions shall be called."
This doesn't necessariliy mean that the kernel should enforce this,
but it should be possible to have an exec in any thread in a thread
group and end up with a single thread executing the new process image,
with the same POSIX process id as before the exec.  So I'm afraid the
"thread group change on exec" assumption of Alan isn't obvious :-(.
By the way, it looks like the behaviour of exec with respect to
signals is ill-specified.  The specification says that the "process
signal mask" is inherited by the new process.  Is that the signal mask
of the calling thread, the signal mask of the initial thread, or some
sort of process wide mask (which doesn't have to exist).  The same
holds for the the pending signals.  Pending for the process, for the
calling thread or perhaps a union of both?
