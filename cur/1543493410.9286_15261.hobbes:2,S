From the description you've given here it's impossible to tell if your
system is slow because of scheduling or because of disk thrashing.  What
does "vmstat 1" output look like when this occurs?

Those are perfectly normal.  If the system has spent any significant
time with the caches busy you could easily accumulate much more time
than that in the update/flush daemons.
What is your self-written program actually doing in the background when
this happens, by the way?
Cheers,
 Stephen.
