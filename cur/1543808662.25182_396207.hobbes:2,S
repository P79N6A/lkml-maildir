I see only support for 16*16*8=2048 devices in scsi-sun.c. Therefore you need
at most 2049 devices to have no possibility for stable device<->b,t,l
relation. Asume 2048 devices had been plugged into USB, so that you have the
mapping 0,0,0 -> yellow burner .. 15,15,7 -> purple burner. If you reuse any
of these IDs, also plugging in the corresponding device would result in a
non-stable ID. (One broken device with serial number = `dd if=/dev/random`
will do the trick, too.)
So if you can't create a stable mapping using b,t,l, why should you bother
trying and mislead your users into asuming a stable mapping? And why should
you impose a btl mapping if it's possible to allow naming the device whatever
the user likes, causing the number of stable device names to be limited only
by it's lifetime?
The only things you need is a list of devices and a way to map a unique ID
to a device name. I posted scripts that will so that.
