For a start, there weren't any proprietary modules in his module list, and 
secondly, "G" means that all modules loaded are GPL.
  1: 'G' if all modules loaded have a GPL or compatible license, 'P' if
     any proprietary module has been loaded.  Modules without a
     MODULE_LICENSE or with a MODULE_LICENSE that is not recognised by
     insmod as GPL compatible are assumed to be proprietary.
  8: 'D' if the kernel has died recently, i.e. there was an OOPS or BUG.
(See Documentation/oops-tracing.txt).
