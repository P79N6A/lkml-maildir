Hello everyone,
In case I am sending this to a list, please CC to me regarding anything 
related to this issue. I am not a member of the list.
I am having a Kernel OOPS with 2.6.0-test1-ac2 (same thing under non-
ac2) using ALSA with OSS compatibily enabled on an Intel 82801CA/CAM 
AC'97 (ICH3 mobile) integrated Audio.
I have activated "Intel i8x0/MX440, SiS 7012; Ali 5455; NForce Audio; 
AMD768/8111" ALSA support and both OSS mixer and PCM compatibility. I 
am attaching the oops.log and the ksymoops.log (not sure if the ksym 
thing is fine, new to this stuff) The non-compatibility mode seems to 
work fine though.
(ALSA driver kernel output bellow)
ALSA device list:
   #0: Intel 82801CA-ICH3 at 0x1c00, irq 10
Also, the OSS (non-ALSA) Intel ICH (i8xx) loads correctly but the sound 
output is  slow (rate or clocking problem?). My sound was fine under 
2.4.21.
(OSS driver kernel output bellow)
i810_audio: Defaulting to base 2 channel mode.
i810_audio: Resetting connection 0
ac97_codec: AC97 Audio codec, id: 0x8384:0x7600 (SigmaTel STAC????)
i810_audio: only 48Khz playback available.
i810_audio: AC'97 codec 0 Unable to map surround DAC's (or DAC's not 
present), t
otal channels = 2
i810_audio: setting clocking to 64937
I realy hope you can fix this in the next release and before -test is 
over. Please keep me informed of any patches and dont hesitate to ask 
if I can help.
Simon
