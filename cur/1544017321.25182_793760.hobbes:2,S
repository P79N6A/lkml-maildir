Ok I see now. Since RCU is locked and pid_alive(task) has been true at
some point, task->group_leader cannot be freed because release_task()
does not release task->group_leader before releasing task. IOW
release_task() can't have started releasing task->group_leader before
rcu_read_lock().
Thank you for your explanation!

My question was probably badly phrased. When reading the patch
description I thought that the point was to fix the helpers so that
tasklist_lock would be taken whenever task != current. Of course your
patch does not do this, and I'm perfectly fine with this.
Thanks,
