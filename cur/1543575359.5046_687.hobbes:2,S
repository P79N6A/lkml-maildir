I think part of the problem is that there are other things labeled 
DANGEROUS that actually do work fairly reliably (offhand, I'm thinking
off the IDE config stuff..). Perhaps it needs to explicitely say
'This is broken and is gauranteed to destroy your data. Do not use it'
The 'DANGEROUS' label seems to suggest that it -may- destroy data, which
leads to the 'it won't happen to me' mentality.
Just my thoughts,
Rene
