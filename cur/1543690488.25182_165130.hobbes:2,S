I get this crash from time to time, and it was also reported on the
linux-dvb list recently:
http://www.linuxtv.org/mailinglists/linux-dvb/2003/08-2003/msg00361.html
But AFAIK there aren't many people who get this, and I didn't find any
possible cause in the DVB drivers.

Only the frontend driver core creates one thread per frontend for monitoring.

If this actually fixes kernel_thread() related crashes then please apply to -pre4.
