i've played with this a little bit more over the weekend. sometimes
cdparanoia gets stuck trying to read some sector. with your patches i
can now stop the process and restart it, and without touching the cd
at all this next time cdparanoia finishes just fine. usually this
happens after i try to rip a series of tracks so i wonder if some
error counters don't get reset or something like that. maybe this is
the expected behaviour, but i don't think i saw cdparanoia get stuck
on the first track ever, usually it happens after some time.
