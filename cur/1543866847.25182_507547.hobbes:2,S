Hi !
I'm trying to use a dongle for ndiswrapper, but it fails because a 
problem of usb. Note that the problem appear when ndiswrapper is fully 
uninstalled (and others packages as ndiswrapper-utils, with modprobe -r, 
etc...).
So ; when I get on the first time the dongle, a lsusb give :
Bus 001 Device 002: ID 0457:0163 Silicon Integrated Systems Corps.
Bus 001 Device 001: ID 0000:0000
But, a few seconds later, the dongle is not recognize with sometimes an 
error -71.
Then, lsusb forget the driver and get :
Bus 001 Device 001: ID 0000:0000
How can I configure the kernel to have the good configuration ? I tried 
different ways, but it fails.
I already reinstalled the bios.
See at below for the result of these commands (when I try the dongle) :
"lspci -v |grep HCI"
"cat /var/log/messages" (the end)
"dmesg |grep usb"
Thanks for help,
Thibaud.
NB1 : thanks to Alex Davis and Oliver Neukum for advices and 
recommendations about check if the problem was from ndiswrapper or not. 
I hope there is not a special list for kernel USB ; if yes : apologizes, 
I couldn't find it.
NB2 : I'm not sure if this message is too long or not. I included the 
mention "End of the message" at last.
