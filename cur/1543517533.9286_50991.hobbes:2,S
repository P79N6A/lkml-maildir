I dug deeper and found that the culprit was ext2 in combination with the
ramdisk. ext2 does bforget() instead of brelse() in ext2/truncate.c and
bforget effectively nukes the buffer out of the ramdisk, so a new one has
to be allocated next time the block is needed. It only happened when
something needed truncation. 
(I had a problem with that because of some customized buffer cache
handling - I could just put the brelse instead and problem solved)
