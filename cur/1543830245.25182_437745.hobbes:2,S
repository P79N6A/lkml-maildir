Subject: [PATCH 003 of 12] md: Delay starting md threads until array is completely setup.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/6/27/150

When an array is started we start one or two threads (two if
there is a reshape or recovery that needs to be completed).
We currently start these *before* the array is completely set up and
in particular before queue->queuedata is set.  If the thread
actually starts very quickly on another CPU, we can end up
dereferencing queue->queuedata and oops.
This patch also makes sure we don't try to start a recovery if
a reshape is being restarted.
