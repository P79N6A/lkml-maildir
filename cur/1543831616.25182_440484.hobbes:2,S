To notice hacking.  RAID protects against hardware failure, it does
_not_ protect against any change that comes through the normal
filesystem channels.  RAID doesn't help the slightest against
viruses and hackers.  RAID is _not_ a backup, when a hacker
(or a user error) changes an important file, it is changed
in all mirrors of a raid-1 set, and raid-5 checksums are updated
so the change becomes valid.  But tripwire will notice that
a protected file changed.
