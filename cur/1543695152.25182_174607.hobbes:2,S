Wouldn't it be better to add ROM enable/disable functions to the PCI driver
than to scatter it out into every driver? All of the framebuffer and DRM
drivers need to do this. I also seem to remember that there are more steps
needed if this is going to work on an ARM chip.

The framebuffer drivers are doing it like this. Should they be replaced with
pci_request_regions?
	/* request the mem regions */
	if (!request_mem_region (rinfo->fb_base_phys,
				 pci_resource_len(pdev, 0), "radeonfb")) {
		printk (KERN_ERR "radeonfb: cannot reserve FB region\n");
		goto free_rinfo;
	}
	if (!request_mem_region (rinfo->mmio_base_phys,
				 pci_resource_len(pdev, 2), "radeonfb")) {
		printk (KERN_ERR "radeonfb: cannot reserve MMIO region\n");
		goto release_fb;
	}
