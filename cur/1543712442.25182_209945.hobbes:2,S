Yes, for about 50-100ms at a time, and -to- the disks, not from them; 
well, the caches anyway.  On 133MB/s PCI, more like 150-300ms of 
saturation on bursts, and shared with the NICs.  I have very short and 
bursty I/O patterns as is typical in real-time applications.  It's 
easier to guarantee latency when your pipes are always at a small 
fraction of their potential.  100ms higher latency, even for part of a 
second, is quite noticeable in what I serve.

PS 2.6 dropped my latencies under load by about 90% over 2.4!  We're 
talking 40-80ms application response time under high load to 8-10ms 
under high load.  <3
