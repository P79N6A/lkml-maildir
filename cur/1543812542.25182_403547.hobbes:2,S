So if we go down this path can we make this functional Documentation?
In particular can we have per process/per interface kinds of flags that
allow access to experimental subsystems?
If the developer has to jump through an extra hoop to use an interface
we have clearly documented this is unsupported and will change in the
future.  Anything else can be easy to miss.
