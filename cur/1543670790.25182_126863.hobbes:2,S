1> scsi HBA driver sym53c8xx didn't set a release method, please fix the 
template
2> Please use the 'usbfs' filetype instead, the 'usbdevfs' name is 
deprecated.
3> request_module: failed /sbin/modprobe -- snd-card-0. error = -16
More long outstanding dmesg information.  For #2, I have 'usbfs' in my 
fstab but this is nonsensical, init hasn't even been started yet. For 
#3, all my sound is compiled in and just after this line there is a 
[too] plentiful ALSA cs46xx output :)
