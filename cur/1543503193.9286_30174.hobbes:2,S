Last week, I had to modify asm/socket.h to compile
some code using SOCK_DGRAM. I believe there was
#if defined(__KERNEL__) near the end of the file and
around some definitions, which I changed to
#if defined(__KERNEL__) || (LIBC_VERSION < 6)
Since it's several days now, I don't remember correctly
what I did ; it was very late and I thought it came
from my broken source tree... But it worked.
