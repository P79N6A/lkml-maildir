Maybe.  It requires that the zonelists be screwy:
 Node 1 DMA free:0kB min:0kB low:0kB high:0kB active:0kB inactive:0kB present:0kB
 protections[]: 0 0 0
 Node 1 Normal free:25272kB min:1020kB low:2040kB high:3060kB active:624172kB inactive:282700kB present:1047936kB
 protections[]: 0 0 0
 Node 1 HighMem free:0kB min:128kB low:256kB high:384kB active:0kB inactive:0kB present:0kB
 protections[]: 0 0 0
 Node 0 DMA free:728kB min:12kB low:24kB high:36kB active:788kB inactive:7848kB present:16384kB
 protections[]: 0 0 0
 Node 0 Normal free:27200kB min:1004kB low:2008kB high:3012kB active:332792kB inactive:422744kB present:1032188kB

 Node 0 HighMem free:0kB min:128kB low:256kB high:384kB active:0kB inactive:0kB present:0kB

See that DMA zone on node 1?  Wonder how it got like that.  It
should not be inside pgdat->nrzones anyway.
David, is your setup NUMA?  Can you show us a sysrq-M dump?
