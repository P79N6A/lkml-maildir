Yes.  Simple isolation is a different and simpler problem that can be
solved with the LSM hooks today.  I brought it up for the contrast in
what the LSM hooks can be useful for.  Hopefully allowing the LSM
hooks to be perceived as something other then just hacks for selinux.
Using a security module for isolation is currently uninteresting
because it would preclude use of a security module like selinux or
smack, because we can have at most one security module at a time
loaded.
I have seen several other places where a custom LSM would have
been a good solution but because we don't allow composition solving
a little problem with the LSm is not interesting enough to allow
the code to be merged.
So I see the current structure of the LSM hooks as hindering
development.

Exactly refactoring security modules into small simple reusable chunks
to allow reuse.  It might look something like selinux chains or it
might not.  Inherently it needs to expose what you can do at the
existing hook points, and it needs to allow usage by different modules
that are compiled in at the same time.
It is certainly the case that you would not need to use all of the
existing hooks to get something done.

Likely.  Until we have a generalized LSM interface with 1000 config
options like netfilter I don't expect we will have grounds to talk
or agree to a common user space interface.  Although I could be
wrong.
