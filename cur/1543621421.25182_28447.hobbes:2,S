Back-seat drivers.  Answers for everything, understanding of nothing.
Sorry, it's not *nearly* that simple.  For one thing, one of the fourteen
billion requirements I've had dropped on me is that Marcelo doesn't want
any symbols in his help file that aren't actually in the 2.4 rulebase.
So I'd have to generate a custom version for him.  I used to have the
machinery to do that by parsing magic comments in my master file.  
Until Linus blew it apart.
