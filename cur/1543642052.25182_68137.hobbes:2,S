Sufficiently quickly is a relative thing.  It could also be that by the time
the pages are reclaimed another <n> have been cleaned.  IMO its no worst
than have freeable pages on lru from any other source.  If we get close to
oom we will call kmem_cache_reap, otherwise we let the lru find the pages.

more specificly kmem_cache_reap will clean the one cache with the most
free pages...

This might be as simple as we can see the free pages in slabs.  We
cannot see other freeable pages in the lru.  This makes slabs seem
like a problem - just because we can see it.
On the other hand we could setup to call __kmem_cache_shrink_locked
after pruning a cache - as it is now this will use page_cache_release
to free the pages...  Need to be careful coding this though.
Andrew, you stated that we need to consider dcache and icache pages
as very important ones.  I submit that this is what slablru is doing.
It is keeping more of these objects around than the previous design,
which is what you wanted to see happen.
Still working on a good reply to your design suggestion/questions?
Ed
