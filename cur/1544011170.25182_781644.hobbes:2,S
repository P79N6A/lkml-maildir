True. I'll add a 'FIXME' comment.
However, I'm yet to see a case where this breaks among x86_32, and I'm no
expert in that area to tell whether it could. (Moving from x86_32 to x86_64
is another story, and will require some compatibility layer anyway).

Same here.

Ooops ... will fix.

Will fix.

Thanks for the review !
Oren.
