Hi, 
I'm nfs-exporting a reiserfs filesystem, the problem is that the
inode-number as seen from the client seems to change from time to
time. This confuses a number of programs, for instance Emacs believes
that the file changed under it when this happens.
Is this a known problem? Any known fix? I found a number of old
messages about problems with reiser and nfs, but not this
specifically.
