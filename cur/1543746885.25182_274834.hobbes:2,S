Yes, but suspending can't practically be a self contained system. We can
try to convince ourselves that we're making it self contained by hiding
behind the driver model, but in reality, the driver model is just a nice
name for our sticky little fingers in all the other drivers, ensuring
they do the right thing when we want to go to sleep. Hooks in other code
is just the equivalent, but without the nice name. Perhaps I should
invent one. How about the "quiescing subsystem"? :>
