This may work, but I can't find this officially documented anywhere, this 
is what the spec says: "Implementations accessing a journaled volume with 
transactions must either refuse to access the volume, or replay the 
journal to be sure the volume is consistent."
So from my side this check stays, until we can at least replay the 
journal.
bye, Roman
