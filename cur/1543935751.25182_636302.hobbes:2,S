Jesper, thank you very much for your answer!
In fact, I tested my change quite extensively using test cases for the
mmap() and msync() system calls from the LTP test suite. Please note
that I did mention that in my previous message:
>>>
Additionally, the test cases for the msync() system call from
the LTP test suite (msync01 - msync05, mmapstress01, mmapstress09,
and mmapstress10) successfully passed using the kernel
with the patch included into this email.
