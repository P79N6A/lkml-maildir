I've had reports of this on the ARM tree.  I've always taken the view that
if a driver is including linux/irq.h, then it is buggy.  It has no business
including that file - it only contains structures and definitions relating
to architecture specific code.
In Linus' tree, the only reference outside arch code to linux/irq.h is:
drivers/pcmcia/hd64465_ss.c:#include <linux/irq.h>
and it'd be good to get rid of that one as well, but AFAICS this is a
sh specific driver.
Please, lets not make it compulsary for architectures to implement the irq
handling described in linux/irq.h.
