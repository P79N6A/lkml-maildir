Nobody complained about it so far (other than you) or has measured it, 
so IMO there's no pressing need and it's simply too late in the cycle to 
touch core timer code like that. 2.6.16 is really cooling down now.
Furthermore, this is known subtle code, and it has accumulated some good 
QA by now. Your first patch-queue already introduced races (the 
"optimize hrtimer_get_remaining" patch) - which you considered to be
part of the "minimum amount of patches for 2.6.16" too.
Dont take this as some negative feedback: most of them look fine to me,
and it's really great that you are contributing to the code, but please
be a bit more patient.
