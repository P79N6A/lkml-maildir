        tlb->need_flush += &__get_cpu_var(quicklist)[0].nr_pages != 0;
makes no sense whatsoever.  How the hell can you ever get the address of
__get_cpu_var(quicklist)[0].nr_pages to be NULL?  Postfix operators have
higher precedence than prefix ones, so that's
	&(((__get_cpu_var(quicklist))[0]).nr_pages)
What did you intend here?  s/&//, perhaps?
