Hmm. It could go both ways. If the problem is some ptrace()/wait4() 
interaction issue (which is certainly not unheard of!) the parent that 
matters for the kernel may be the right thing to print out.
I wonder if we should just print out both (or perhaps print out the 
ptrace parent only if it differs from the normal parent?)
I'll apply this, because I agree that it's sensible in general, I just 
wonder how often anybody really even cares about the parent information 
when it's not about some wait-related issue..
