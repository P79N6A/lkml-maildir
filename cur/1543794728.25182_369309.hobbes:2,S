And funny enough unlike SCSI adapters and things for large server
installations, nobody seems to really care enough about graphics
cards, I've heard horror stories about how little Linux companies
actually care about open source graphics, I suppose they have to
follow the profit but still you'd like to think they effect of all
this "open source drivers, get them in the kernel" work that is being
done would at some point spill over ....
When someone gets up of their arse and sues nvidia or ATI and wins,
then feel free to change these exports, otherwise your view on who is
right has as much legal value as their view, whether we like it or
not..
