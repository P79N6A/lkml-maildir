Really???  Have you ever tried this? RedHat provides a directory
of random patches that won't patch regardless of the order in
which you attempt patches (based upon date-stamps on patches or
date-stamps on files). It's like somebody just copied in some
junk, thinking nobody would ever bother.
Some distributions don't even provide source. They provide
copies of /usr/src/linux/include/asm and /usr/src/linux/include/linux
but nothing else. You have to "find" source on the internet.
Some distributions don't even provide that, instead they provide
copies of /usr/src/linux/include/linux and /usr/src/linux/include/asm
under /usr/include.
The "good-ol-days" where you could get 72 floppies from Yggdrasil,
install Linux, and spend the next 48 hours watching it compile
are long gone.
I have never found a distribution that uses modules, in which is
was even remotely possible to duplicate the kernel supplied.

Penguin : Linux version 2.4.1 on an i686 machine (797.90 BogoMips).
    I was going to compile a list of innovations that could be
    attributed to Microsoft. Once I realized that Ctrl-Alt-Del
    was handled in the BIOS, I found that there aren't any.
