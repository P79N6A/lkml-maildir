Before your /proc enhancement, it made no sense because there was no
way to set parameters.  By default, the LSM does nothing.  We should
change that comment now (as soon as it's working).

Long ago, I built and ran it linked into the kernel (with different
parameter defaults), which worked at the time.  It may matter how some
of the other security modules are configured.  Perhaps some additional
Kconfig dependency checking would help.  I'm not an expert at that.
