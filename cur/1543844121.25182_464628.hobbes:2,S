I was aware of that this errata existed, but never actually knew the
actual specifics of it. Are these two separate problems or just
one?
a) the errata & a possible thread having an IP leading back within (not
   at the start of) the range to be replaced.
b) the errata & replacing single instruction with single instruction of
   same size.
In a), there's almost an intractable problem of making sure no IP leads
back within the range to be replaced. In b) we still have to take care
of the errata part, but no worry about the stalled thread with invalid
IP.

I was vaguely aware of the issue on x86. Do you know if this applies the
same on other achitectures?
Also, this is SMP-only, right? (Not that single UP matters for desktop
anymore, but just checking.)
Any pointers to the errata?
