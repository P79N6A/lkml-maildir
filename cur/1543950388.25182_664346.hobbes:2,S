Subject: Fwd: init process failed when booting linux

Hi,
 When I was booting my Linux (2.6.17) on my FPGA-prototyped system, the
 init process always failed. Below is the serial console message I've
 got:
 <6>Freeing init memory: 584K
 Freeing init memory: 584K
 ø<6>/init exit code: -14
 /init exit code: -14
 <4>Failed to execute /init
 Failed to execute /init
 Things went wrong from the third line. I've looked at the
 corresponding linux code, the boot process stopped at a data abort
 exception from address in __arch_clear_user at 0xc012ad44. Any ideas
 on why this is happening and possible ways to fix it would be greatly
 appreciated.
 Jack
