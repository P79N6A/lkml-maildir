I agree with David here.  Please work to find the root cause of this
problem.  If it turns out that all of these chipsets have broken MSI and
can't handle it at all (oops, that's a major bug...) then we will accept
this patch.
But for now, let's not take a band-aid that prevents others from working
to solve the real issues here.
