As I understand it, /dev/ttyS0-3 are set to industry standard values on
startup (they are not probed).  The values can be changed using the
command-line utility setserial.  You can specify non-standard values in an
rc.serial conf file which will be read on startup.
The setserial manpage covers this is some detail.
