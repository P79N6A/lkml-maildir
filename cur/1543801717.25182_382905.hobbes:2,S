Wouldn't it be worthwhile to add -Wno-uninitialized for gcc4, since those 
warnings mostly have to be ignored (and are therefore not useful for 
finding actual uninitialized variables) and make it harder to see other 
types of warnings which might be informative?
This would also reduce the number of patches submitted for correct code, 
since people wouldn't keep having to be told to ignore those warnings.
