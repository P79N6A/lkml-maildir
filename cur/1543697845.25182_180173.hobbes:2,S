How about tracking the number of current sockets that have had timestamp 
requests for them? If this number is zero, don't bother with the 
timestamps. The first time you get a SIOCGSTAMP ioctl on a given socket, 
bump the count and set a flag; decrement the count when the socket is 
destroyed if the flag is set.
The drawback is that the first SIOCGSTAMP on any particular socket will 
have to return a bogus value (maybe just the current time?). Ways to 
mitigate that are:
- have a /proc option to let the sysadmin enforce timestamps on all 
packets (just bump the counter)
- bump the counter whenever an interface is in promiscuous mode (I 
imagine that tcpdump et al are the main users of the timestamps?)
