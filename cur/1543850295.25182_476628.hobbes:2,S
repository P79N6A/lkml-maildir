Heiko suggested that earlied in 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/10/9/22,
but Andrew didn't like it.
Currently, the worst is that sysfs_remove_file can be used
on a nonexisting file,  but sysfs_remove_group cannot, which is
inconsistent. Either sysfs_remove_file should WARN_ON or
sysfs_remove_group should silently return, and I'd prefer the
latter, as it makes users simpler.
