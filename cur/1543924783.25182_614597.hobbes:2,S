Well the VFS (for example) certainly doesn't support any encodings  
other than various extended-ASCII forms (which includes UTF-8).   
Something like UTF-16 has extra null characters in-between every  
normal character, and as such would fail completely if passed to the  
VFS.
Personally I think that isspace() accepting character 0xA0 is a bug,  
as there are several variants of extended ASCII only one of which has  
that character as a space.  Others have it as á (accented A), etc.   
In addition the "canonical" internal text format of the kernel is  
UTF-8 as that encoding can represent any character in any other  
encoding and it is backwards-compatible with traditional ASCII.
