Ok, there's two sets of changes between .73 and .74 which touch PCMCIA.
The first is 2.5.73-bk1-bk2 and the second is 2.5.73-bk8-bk9.
ftp.kernel.org:/pub/linux/kernel/v2.5/snapshots/incr/patch-2.5.73-bk1-bk2.bz2
ftp.kernel.org:/pub/linux/kernel/v2.5/snapshots/incr/patch-2.5.73-bk8-bk9.bz2
I'm not going to try to guess which caused the problem, but I'm intrigued
to know which is causing the problems.
Thanks for your efforts so far tracking the problem down.
