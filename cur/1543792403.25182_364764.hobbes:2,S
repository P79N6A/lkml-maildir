Though I admit that I never build inside the source tree, I can't see
what you apparently do. Where/how would the behavior differ? If you just
mean the fact that in-source-tree builds will need to continue to
specify ARCH/SUBARCH on the make command line, then of course yes, this
is going to be different. But building in the source tree is a bad idea
in general in my opinion, and hence I would view this as the price you
pay. Of course this information could be stored in a hidden file in the
output tree (rather than in mkmakefile itself) if that's more
desirable...
