This implies read(O_NONBLOCK) should never block.
Maybe your code should pass down __GFP_FAIL in the gfp_mask 
to the page_cache_alloc() to avoid blocking reclaiming pages,
and possibly pass info down to the block layer 
"if this is going to block, fail".
We have a bdi_congested() check before doing the readahead (dont RA
if the queue is full). Check if that really works - I'm afraid
it can block because the check is not done at each page 
submitted, but rather at each readahead operation (which 
can be several pages large).
