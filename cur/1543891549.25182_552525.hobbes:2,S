I forgot to mention this in my original message, the only place that I had seen this problem is on a certain machine (Dell 2950) with a certain distribution (FC6) kernel.  I had trimmed the code down to fit in 4K stacks already quite a bit.

It may not help, since the NMIs used to detect soft lockups will still
be received; the soft lockup update call just updates the per-cpu
timer, but there may be less chance of overrunning the end of the
stack from not getting the stack trace.
There is no substitute for implementing your own firmware uploading
mechanism or getting this one addressed though ;-) .
