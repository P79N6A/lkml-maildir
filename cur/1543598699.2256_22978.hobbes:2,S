I was wondering whether the kernel community had any interest in seeing a
dynamic api capability in the kernel. What I have in mind the ability for a
kernel module to request a system call entry be added by supplying a call
name to a create_dynamic_api service. This service would assign a system
call number by looking for an unused slot (not from the beginning of the
syscall table but from a defined location so as to avoid reserved calls).
It would create a /proc/dynapi/api_name - the content of this file would
contain the call number.
It seems like a harmless enough idea. And I sort of like the idea of using
a system call rather than turning a kernel module into a device driver just
for the sake of a user communication mechanism.  I envisage this being of
use to projects where they need a user-kernel interface but not a generic
one.
Comments please.
