Yes, this is almost  the configuration my wife still uses for her
work - Word6, Win3.1, 386SX notebook at 20MHz (circa 1992). She wrote
two books with this notebook and is writing third. And has no desire to
upgrade before it mechanically breaks down. Functionally it is
all what is needed ! The only problem is that batteries were not too good
back in 1992 :)
Generally, I think that in enviroment were computer is actually used
for some  work (and not just computer development), the lifetime
of hardware is somewhat longer than it may seem. I'd say 10 years at
least. In my research institute (astrophysics), which is explicitely
oriented on keeping computing up-to-date (and even on the leading edge,
where possible), we just now finally phased out 10-12 year old Sun
SparcStations, used by students as X-terminals for last 4-5 years
