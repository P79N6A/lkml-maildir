As we can see from the console output here,  physbase isn't page aligned when 
the panic occurs.  So we could as well send (start_pfn << PAGE_SHIFT) to 
reserve_bootmem_node() instead of physbase. your thoughts ?.
Also end_pfn in mark_reserved_region_for_nid() is defined as 
unsigned long end_pfn = ((physbase + size) >> PAGE_SHIFT);
Does this refer to the pfn after the area that we are interested in ?.  We have 
atleast two fixes here,  
1. Limit start and end to bdata->node_min_pfn  and bdata->node_low_pfn in 
reserve_bootmem_node() and add comments out in there that the caller of the 
funtion should be aware of how much are they reserving. 
2. send (start_pfn << PAGE_SHIFT) to reserve_bootmem_node() instead of 
physbase.
