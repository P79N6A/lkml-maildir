I'm not sure I understand how device nodes on UFS/ext2/etc could be
pseudolinks to in-core quasi mount points. Don't get me wrong, I
believe you, I just lack understanding.
One thing I think this approach lacks (or may lack) is an easy
automatic device node creation. With devfs, the deivce node is
as if it is created implicitely upon registration by the driver.
I might be WAYY off base, so correct me if I'm grossly mistaken.
