Hi,
We are trying to use RTLinux thread to service a PCI-based multi-port serial card.  I have read several documents regarding "sharing IRQs", using boot-prompt parameters, IO-APIC.txt, etc.  I am being told by the RTLinux community that I must not share interrupts when using real-time thread to service a PCI-based function.  I have tried using several combinations of boot-prompt parameters (we are using GRUB) but have had no success in redirecting IRQ assignment during boot-time!
I have tried to use "pirq=" boot parameter.....the booting kernel does acknowledge the parameter but appears to forget about it when PCI probing occurs.  It assigns my two PCI-based boards the same way each time: slot #1=5, slot #2=11.  I have made some semi-smart attempts to use the "pci=" parameters "nobios", "noapic" (my kernel does not recognize this one), and "nosort" in conjunction with the "pirq=" parameter.  [I guess my "semi-smart attempts" are not that smart].
Is it possible to do what I want to do?  Would you have any ideas on what I could try next.
I am not using a multi-processor board but have selected the IO-APIC option before making the compiler.
What I am using:
- kernel: GPL 2.4.18 (with IO-APIC compiled in)
- RTLinux: 3.2-pre1
-Tyan motherboard with PIII
- gcc 3.2.1
Thanks in advance for taking the time to respond to my queries.
Regards.....Robert
