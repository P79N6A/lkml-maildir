Maybe syscalls that only have to move a very small chunk of data 
(gettimeofday(2), for instance), are hurt because of the wasted bytes they 
are prefetching after the intended data? Also, for sizes greater than 512, 
copy_to_user will call mmx_copy_user, which might call mmx_memcpy, which does 
prefetching already on x86 CPUs that support it.
