Perhaps a brief look at the code will help. Please forgive my
non-preservation of whitespace as I cut and pasted it.
static inline void balance_irq(int irq)
{
#if CONFIG_SMP
    irq_balance_t *entry = irq_balance + irq;
    unsigned long now = jiffies;
    if (unlikely(entry->timestamp != now)) {
        unsigned long allowed_mask;
        int random_number;
        rdtscl(random_number);
        random_number &= 1;
        allowed_mask = cpu_online_map & irq_affinity[irq];
        entry->timestamp = now;
        entry->cpu = move(entry->cpu, allowed_mask, now, random_number);
        set_ioapic_affinity(irq, 1 << entry->cpu);
    }
#endif
}
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
	1 << entry->cpu
This could be problematic ...
static void set_ioapic_affinity (unsigned int irq, unsigned long mask)
{
    unsigned long flags;
    /*
     * Only the first 8 bits are valid.
     */
    mask = mask << 24;
    spin_lock_irqsave(&ioapic_lock, flags);
    __DO_ACTION(1, = mask, )
    spin_unlock_irqrestore(&ioapic_lock, flags);
}
According to this, nothing over 8 cpu's can work as the cpu id is used
as a shift into an 8-bit bitfield. Also,
#define __DO_ACTION(R, ACTION, FINAL)                                   \
                                                                        \

        int pin;                                                        \

                if (pin == -1)                                          \

                reg = io_apic_read(entry->apic, 0x10 + R + pin*2);      \
                reg ACTION;                                             \
                io_apic_modify(entry->apic, reg);                       \
                if (!entry->next)                                       \
                        break;                                          \
                entry = irq_2_pin + entry->next;                        \
        }                                                               \
        FINAL;                                                          \

ACTION is supposed to be an assignment to reg; in clustered hierarchical
destination format this is not a bitmask as assumed by 1 << entry->cpu.
Matt, Mike, please comment.
Cheers,
