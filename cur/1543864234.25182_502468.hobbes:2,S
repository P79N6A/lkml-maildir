Actually, no, the whole idea of page cache is that overall system i/o 
can be faster if data sit in the page cache for a while. But the real 
problem is that the application write is now disconnected from the 
physical write, both in time and order.
No standard says the kernel couldn't do direct DMA, but since having 
that required is needed to guarantee write order and error status linked 
to the actual application i/o, what a kernel "might do" is irrelevant.
It's much easier to do O_DIRECT by actually doing the direct i/o than to 
try to catch all the corner cases which arise in faking it.
