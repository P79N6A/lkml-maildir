As I said above it's called from dma_alloc_from_coherent() from 
dma_alloc_coherent().

So, you agree that a check should be added to bitmap_find_free_region()? 
As for details - to warn or not to warn and what error code to return, 
that can be discussed, although "No space left on device" doesn't seem to 
fit very well IMHO:-)
