While looking to integrate this I discovered that the current default
was a desired feature requested by Ingo.  So I guess we need to come up
with a combination of options which give us both.
Currently we have --[no-]summary meaning suppress/add a summary, and
--quiet meaning suppress output but which does not suppress the summary.
We have a few options:
1) allow doubling of -q to make the summary subject to -q,
2) allow doubling of --summary to mean "override -q", --summary becoming
   subject to -q,
3) add a new option --force-summary which always produces a summary,
   --summary becoming subject to -q, and
4) add a new option --summary-on-fail which is subject to -q.
I feel the last of these is the most obvious option, and carries
no modification to current semantics.
Thoughts?
