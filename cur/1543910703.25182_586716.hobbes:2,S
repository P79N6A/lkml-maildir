Hmm, I'm a bit confused too. :)
The subject says MODALIAS was removed, but I don't think that it ever
was there for a usb-device event. And sure, it's still there for a
usb-interface event.
Andreas, do I read this right, you miss:
  DEVICE, PRODUCT, TYPE
in the usb-interface event, and they only exist in the usb-device event?
And MODALIAS is not what you miss, and the subject of the mail is
misleading?
Note:
DEVICE only exists when USB_DEVICE_CLASS=y, because it unfortunately is
prefixed with the /proc mount path, which doesn't exist when the /proc
device node support is not compiled in, so nothing should depend on the
existence of DEVICE. Most of the recent distros don't mount or configure
usbfs anymore, but use /dev/bus/usb/ device nodes, which can handle
access control lists for local users.
Is this patch fixing your problem?
