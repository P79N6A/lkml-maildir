Neither of which had anything to do with the whole "slow down" argument.
If you have a bug, make a bug report, and push it, and make people aware 
of it. But don't make it an argument for development to slow down.
Should we all stand around with our thumbs up our *ss because somebody has 
a bug? Should the other developers just stop, because suspend-to-disk is 
broken for somebody? Should everything come to a standstill because David 
Newall doesn't like how there are other things going on that are 
independent of _his_ problems?
Do you really believe that?
