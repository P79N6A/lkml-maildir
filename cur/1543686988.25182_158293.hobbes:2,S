Increasingly, a new type of futex with a hook into the scheduler looks
like the right answer to this question.  But I prefer not to need a
kernel patch.  Like most people with this dilemma, my programs are
likely to be run by folk who will not use non-mainstream kernels.

Indeed.  But how do you suggest rolling a scheduler on my own while
the kernel is blocking me? :)

Heh :)  Am not really aiming for real-time, just reasonable response
times and no unnecessary idle time.  My goal is web servers, file
servers, database servers and interactive apps.  Real-time could be
another goal - does your employer pay for good papers? ;)

It _only_ arises if the application is alone.  When there are others,
its quite reasonable to expect to be preempted, if we are not doing real-time.
When the application is alone those unwanted long stalls occur when an
application has _self-contention_, due to running too many kernel
worker threads which preempt each other.
This is the main fundamental reason for not just running lots of
threads.  (Secondary reasons are to reduce memory consumption and
reduce locking requirements).

Quite; it's ok to give up CPU under those circumstances.  That is
fair, and not wasting anything.

Even this "fast path" is two extra syscalls per original syscall.
Syscalls are not that fast that we are happy to sprinkle them around.

There is nothing wrong with trying to do some other work during a VM
page-in.  Folk do it all the time, it's called running multiple threads :)

It matters because of two unwanted context switches per original
syscall.  That's overhead which would outweigh the gain in many benchmarks.

The point of wake-without-putting-back-to-sleep is to avoid most of
the extra syscalls and the context switches.  Otherwise the overhead
of the mechanism makes it perform poorly in the cases where there is
very little blocking.
