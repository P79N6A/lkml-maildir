Thanks, added.

Hmm.

Yes, perhaps.
It was easy to decide not to take your text, since it is far too long.
Presently I have
       Under Linux, select may report a socket file descriptor as
       "ready  for reading", while nevertheless a subsequent read
       blocks. This  could  for  example  happen  when  data  has
       arrived  but  upon  examination  has wrong checksum and is
       discarded. There may be other circumstances.  Thus it  may
       be  safer  to  use  O_NONBLOCK  on sockets that should not
       block.
Your above few lines on the self-pipe trick suffice for select.2,
but I wouldnt mind if you (or anybody else) wrote something a bit
more explicit in select_tut.2.
