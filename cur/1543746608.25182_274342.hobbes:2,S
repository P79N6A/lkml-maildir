That's a very good observation.
I think it's unintended, but I'm not sure.
I've forgotten what can_do_mlock on shm was about.
Offhand I find it hard to grasp whether it's harmless or bad,
but inclined to think bad - if there happen to be lots of small
enough shared memory segments on the system, a series of processes
run by one unprivileged user can lock down lots of memory?
Isn't it further the case that any process can now SHM_UNLOCK
any segment?  That would surely be wrong.
I've added Rik and Chris to the CC list, they seem to be the
main can_do_mlock guys, hope they can answer.
