More mm4 raid-1 troubles.
This time, the kernel panicked upon shutdown.  I was able
to write down the call trace:
process swapper
super_written
__end_that_request_first
blk_ordered_complete
scsi_end_request
scsi_io_completion
blk_done_softirq
__do_softirq
call_softirq
RIP:md_error
RSP:ffffffff80765e00
CR2:0000000000000048
<0> kernel panic - not syncing: Aiee, killing interrupt handler
Hw involved:
Three raid-1, two on plain scsi and one on SATA.
Each raid-1 consists of two partitions.  This time,
each md device was running in degraded mode.
Booting into 2.6.15 in order to re-add devices and sync the RAID,
I get only 2768K/sec reconstruction speed on SATA, still
1108 minutes (18 hours) to go. :-( 
Odd, as 2.6.17mm4 resynced this in 50min, but hit a
write error (real or imagined?) immediately afterwards.
The other older devices, on plain scsi, resynced much faster.
19381K/sec
More than a little irritating, I need the SATA raid-1 to be in sync
so lilo can install mm5 for me. 18 hours. 
Looks like 2.6.17mm4 doesn't like mirror devices?
