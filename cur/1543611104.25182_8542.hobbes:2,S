I don't want to speak for either Jens or Linus, but from what Jens was
telling me months ago, and from my reading of Jens' earlier patches,
this seems to indeed be the case.  I've been looking forward to sending
non-block-sized I/Os to and from a new filesystem I'm working on.

If you are hacking on NTFS please make sure to base changes on
"ntfs-driver-tng" in the "linux-ntfs" sourceforge cvs.  It is now, as of
the past week, completely modern to 2.4 vfs standards, and should
support all read-only features except attribute lists.
