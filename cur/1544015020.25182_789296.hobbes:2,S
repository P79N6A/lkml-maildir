You're right.  Sorry, I'd like to see the comment fixed.  That 3 does
matter and I don't want to see someone not realize how important getting
that len right is....

I'll go ahead and vote I don't care, even though I brought it up.  My
code left an extra space at the end of the record.  Yours puts it at the
beginning.  From the point of view of auditd the spaces don't mean
anything, so I'm ok with your method.  I guess it saves a call to
audit_log_format, and saving a call is benefit enough
Don't care if it's this window or the next, it's been like this for 3
weeks short of a year now  :)
