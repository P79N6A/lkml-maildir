Heard back from hushmail support -- 
"Outgoing mail is currently wrapping at 68 characters for new mail, 
and
64 chars for replies. This is to ensure that digital signatures 
retain
the correct format for the recipient to be able to verify."
.... and no way to change from w/in any hushmail client.  just 
attempted similar thing with a yahoo account and was able to 
resolve this issue, so all hushmail users can be warned that 
wordwrapping will be an issue on patch submission and another route 
will be required.
