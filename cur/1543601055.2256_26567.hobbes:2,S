The driver should instead poll the device at regular, adjustable intervals, 
and read ALL the data it can at each interval.  Assuming the hardware allows 
that, of couse.

This is a basic, first-year computer science question.  Just use a circular 
buffer.  You can get the algorithm from any CS book.

Sure, just use one circular buffer per process.

Increase the rate at which you read the hardware FIFO.  Or perhaps, use the 
reads to your /dev device as a trigger to get more data from the HW.
