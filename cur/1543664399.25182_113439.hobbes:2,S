Sorry, I sent the last patch before I got your email.
Also, the "+1" is still necessary, even if we switch to sizeof. The sprintf 
call that follows copies DM_DIR, followed by a slash, followed by the name 
from the hash table into the allocated string. The "+1" is for the slash in 
the middle. The terminating NULL character is accounted for in DM_NAME_LEN.
Linus, here is (yet another!) patch against current BK.
