Hi Ingo,
  You are correct that the data is in fact interpreted as a boolean.  I
also had considered using a more boolean-like notation at one point.
However, I then figured I went through the expense of computing it, I
might as well store the actual value as an integer in case it can be
used in another way.  But to be honest, I cannot really think of any
other potential uses, so perhaps we would be best to follow your
suggestion.  It could always be changed if such a need ever arises.
Thank you for the feedback!
Regards,
-Greg
