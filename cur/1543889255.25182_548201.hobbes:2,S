udev will act on that event, and as I mentioned, not read anything from
sysfs at all, unless a custom rule is in the rules file asking it to
read a specific sysfs file in the tree.
So no "scanning" happens unless specificically asked for.
And as mentioned, udev can work just fine without sysfs enabled at all
now, with the exception of some custom rules for some devices.
