i think the stop_machine() method for code patching is pretty elegant in 
that it reuses an otherwise rarely used but critical facility. We want 
it to be fast and easy, and our current ftrace testing shows that it is. 
So unless there are strong reasons to do otherwise, it would be nice to 
keep that approach :-)
