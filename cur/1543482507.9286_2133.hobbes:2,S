Subject: Horrible parport performance when IRQ enabled

I just upgraded to the 2.2.0 kernel, and the speed at which the data is 
transferred to my printer is horrible when I print through /dev/lp0.  I have a 
standard PC parallel port, and I compiled parport, parport_pc and lp as 
modules. 
When I load all these modules the printing is fast, but when I enable 
interrupt-driven operations through procfs or by specifying irq=5 when I load 
the parport_pc module, the printer performance becomes horrible.  It prints 
for a few seconds, then pauses for about a minute, then resumes for a few 
seconds, etc. 
For as far as I know there are no other devices that could possibly conflict 
with my parallel port.  Is this a bug in the parport driver or am I doing 
something wrong here?  Note that my printer used to work fine under 2.0.33-36 
Best regards, 
Alex Adriaanse
