I don't think so. I once had the same problem with my board. On 2.6.16.x I got 
same message. 2.6.18-rcx booted further, but hanged. Above parameter helped 
though with 2.6.18-rc. As I haven't tested 2.6.17 nor 2.6.16 with obve 
parameter, I could only guess. The real fix for me though was to disable the 
nvidia quirk. Then my system boots and runs fine with 2.6.18-rc kernel w/o 
any additional parameter. You may want to look into:
