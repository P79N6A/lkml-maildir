I notice that the first thing people suggest is to make things like 
udev, hal and sysfs required instead of optional to do something as 
simple as burn a CD. As I mentioned before, if the kernel provided a 
list of devices then applications wouldn't break every time a new kernel 
came out which needs a new this, and new that, and a few new other 
support things.
The kernel could provide a list of devices by category. It doesn't have 
to name them, run scripts, give descriptions, or paint them blue. Just a 
list of all block devices, tapes, by major/minor and category (ie. 
block, optical, floppy) would give the application layer a chance to do 
it's own interpretation. HAL is great, but because it's not part of the 
kernel it's also going to suffer from "tracking error" for some changes. 
I find it easier to teach someone to use -scanbus than to explain how to 
make rules for udev.

Worth repeating: I find it easier to teach someone to use -scanbus than 
to explain how to make rules for udev. HAL is the right answer, but *in* 
the kernel, where it will track changes. Since -scanbus tells you a 
device is a CDrecorder, or something else, *any user* is likely to be 
able to tell it from DCD, CD-ROM, etc. Nice like of text for most devices...
Note: my example of major/minor is just that, almost any presentation 
which showed all devices user applications would normally use, in a well 
defined way, would address the identifications issue.
