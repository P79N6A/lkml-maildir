Yeah, may as well.
The buffermem_pages accounting is vaguely interesting because
it tells us how much of ZONE_NORMAL is being usefully used for
blockdev pagecache.  And ZONE_NORMAL utilisation is a bit of a
hot topic at present.
But the same information can be obtained on-demand by running
around the bdev superblock's inodes adding up nr_pages.  That
approach is better than the per-page atomic ops in buffer.c.
