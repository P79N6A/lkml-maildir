There's two levels here: first the patched in callsites. Those are NOPs in 
the usual case - there's no overhead for the default 'function tracing is 
built in but not enabled' case.
There's a second level: a /debug/tracing/tracing_enabled lightweight 
dynamic flag to flip tracing on/off while the tracer is enabled. _That_ 
one, if it ever matters to a codepath, is default-enabled.
I.e. the above code sequence is correct.
