the SB module AFAIK is for ISA cards only.  This card (like my pci64) uses
the es1370 driver, not the sb driver.  All you need to do is modprobe
es1370.  The nice thing about PCI cards is they don't need to be told where
the io/irq/etc is at...

All you need here is CONFIG_SOUND and CONFIG_SOUND_ES1370.  The rest is
completely irrelevent to the card.
I have found out, some programs like xwave, mixviews, rvplayer, etc do not
like the es1370 driver.  (alen, any clues?)  I kept my sb16 in the machine
when I got the pci64 card.  I'm glad I did for the above reason.  the sb16
and the sbpci64 have never conflicted.  Its nice.  /dev/dsp and /dev/dsp1 is
on the 64 and /dev/dsp2 is on the 16.
