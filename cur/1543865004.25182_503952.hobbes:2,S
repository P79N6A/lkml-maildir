Pretty simple: you read the largely-useless changelog then call the bravely
uncommented blk_plug_current() when you're about to submit some IO and you
call the audaciously uncommented blk_unplug_current() when you've finished
and you're ready to let it rip.
But usually none of that is necessary, because io_schedule() does all the
work for you.
err, this might help.
