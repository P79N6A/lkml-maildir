I understand the formal specs (the email from Michael is very clear). What I'm
saying is that as the `dummy' statement is redoundant information but you're
requiring us to put it to build a labeled-statement, you could been even more
lazy and not define the labeled-statement as a statement so requiring us to put
a dummy statement after every label. That would been the same kind of issue
we're facing right now (but of course defining a labeled-statement as a
statement and allowing recursion makes the formal specs even simpler so that
probably wouldn't happen that easily).
