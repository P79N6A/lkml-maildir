That seemed to me to be the right thing to do.

You can't really do that as you get weird behaviour then when people do
	tcgetattr
		|= BOTHER;
		speed = 19200;
	tcsetattr
later in the same app
	tcgetattr
		speed = 38400
	tcsetattr
knowing that they set BOTHER already.
I guess you could add both ioctl sets anyway but the plan longer term is
for glibc tcsetattr/getattr to do the right thing with the new ioctls in
all cases, as the glibc interface already provides speed fields.
