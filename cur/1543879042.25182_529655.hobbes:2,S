Excuse me, but is there ANYBODY willing to give a binding statement on
that? First you tell "us CD writing guys" to manage that in user space
[1] and when we get real critical questions then everything we get is
radio silence? Very kindly. NOT.
Background: there are two good ways we can go:
a) carefully collecting device properties, mapping and opening
   additional devices
b) additional lockfiles delegating the locking operations
Unfortunately b leads to major problems in practice, while a looks
more promising but need a guarantee that it will be kept be working and
harmless in the future kernel releases. We need to know that before
moving on to missionary work.
Regards,
Eduard.
[1] which IMO still sucks because it's allowed to have device driver
access from any file, thus dealing locking problems at file level is
like fighting a hydra. And with multiple semi-autonomous drivers for the
same hardware even the previous silver bullet (O_EXCL) does not help.
