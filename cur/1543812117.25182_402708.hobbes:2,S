How do you expect the patch to be picked up, if you don't cc the
maintainer? Looking up the maintainer is trivial. We can't always rely
on akpm forwarding patches, seems a lot saner to put the onus on the
submitter to make sure it gets to the right place.
Lack of time is really not an excuse. Looking up and cc'ing the
maintainer is certainly the least time consuming part of
producing/testing a patch.
