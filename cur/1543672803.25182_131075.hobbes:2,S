Probably GCC is keeping the value of the variable around in
some register. Did you declare the global variable as 'volatile'?
[as in "it can be modified by entities external to the flow of 
the code"]. Try that.
On the other hand - being an integer, access should be atomic,
most of the time, but I would not really trust that, at least
portability wise. Protecting access to it with a mutex would
be a good idea ...

You need the preemption patches or 2.5
I hope you are not trying to do serious real-time w/ Linux ... are you?

Dunno - you'd have to check the internal implementation in
glibc. Last time I heard anything about it, it had some
mutex dangling around, but I could be wrong.
