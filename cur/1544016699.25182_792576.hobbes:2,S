Agreed, that lack of a means to obtain i2c devices in board configs is
beginning to get in the way
of quite a few things.  Perhaps we need to start a proper discussion on
how to sort that out.
(some sort of registered call backs perhaps to allow the right dev
pointers to be set on the i2c
device finally being allocated?)  I'm guessing the i2c guys are going to
have strong views
on any changes to their allocation approach!

Agreed.  This definitely isn't the way to go in the long run (assuming
otg etc get cleaned up)
but would it be an acceptable stop gap?  I'm just keen to get the
functionality available
so as to get a board config (intel stargate 2) sorted.  (some of which
you were kind enough to
review a while back - thanks).
