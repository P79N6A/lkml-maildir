I had a lot of these fixed already.  These will be mostly in the fixlets

This?
	$(patsubst -pg,,$(patsubst -fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage,,$(1)))
I don't see any connection to include paths there.

x86_64 doesn't, but i386 does.  Fixed now.

Fixed.

OK, I need to look at this a bit more.

Fixed.

Sigh.  Fixed now.

Fixed.

Fixed.

Looks to me like it all applies to i386 too, except that __delay looks 
unoptimizable.
It also looks to me like I could implement __udelay as n=... ; __delay(n);
And also never mind the fact that __udelay and __const_udelay are identical.

The trailing \ aside, which is fixed, that's a reminder for me when I add
the 32-bit compatibility code.

Oops.  This requires a bit of thought.  Offhand, I think they need to be 
printf, because that early in boot, printk'd stuff may not reach the screen
if UML exits then.

OK, send me what you have, and if we've fixed the same thing differently,
I choose one or the other.
