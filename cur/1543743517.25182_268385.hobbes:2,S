Twice for each -bk to look for "not my fault" issues (preempt and not), 
usually once with some combination of Nick, Con, or Ingo patches, and 
then with config options depending on what's been added. Not to mention 
patches I cull from here and my own set of network patches.
For some people I bet the limit is 24/{compile_time} per day.
