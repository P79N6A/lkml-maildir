this is a long-term suggestion, but the easiest solution might be to
introduce a new kbuild directive:  "selectablemenu" or something like
that, with a form similar to:
=================
selectablemenu ISDN
	bool "ISDN support"
config ...
config ...
config ...
endmenu
=================
  the top level entry would be just a yes/no toggle as to whether you
want that support in general, and the internal entries would represent
the submenu and all of them would *automatically* depend on the top
config entry (in this case, ISDN).  and the "help" entry could be
available from that top-level entry without having to enter the
submenu. as opposed to what you need to do now.
  i'm guessing that structure would be sufficient for 90% of the
current menu layouts.  just a thought.
