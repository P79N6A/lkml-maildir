Ok. What's the right layer to do this? The current ACPI/anything else 
glue depends on specific knowledge about the bus concerned, and needs 
callbacks registered before devices are added to that bus. Doing it in 
the sata layer would have the potential for unhappiness on mixed 
sata/scsi machines.
