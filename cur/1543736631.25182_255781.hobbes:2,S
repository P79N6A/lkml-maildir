This assumes that MAX_INOTIFY_DEV_WATCHERS is an integral multiple
of BITS_PER_LONG, otherwise, the last word will be missing.
Perhaps this would this better be written as:
	DECLARE_BITMAP(bitmask, MAX_INOTIFY_DEV_WATCHERS);
and the clearing of it in the original patch:
> +	memset(dev->bitmask, 0,
> +	  sizeof(unsigned long) * MAX_INOTIFY_DEV_WATCHERS / BITS_PER_LONG);
might better be written as:
	CLEAR_BITMAP(dev->bitmask, MAX_INOTIFY_DEV_WATCHERS);
