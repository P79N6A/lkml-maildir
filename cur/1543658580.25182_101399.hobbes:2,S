   Don't add stupid bloat to the kernel because somebody is silly
   enough to care about a 32-bit oprofile working with a 64-bit kernel. 
Being that 32-bit is the primary (and in many ways, ONLY) userland for
at least 2 64-bit kernel platforms, I think this does matter.
We're exporting an int to userland, what kind of bloat is that really?
