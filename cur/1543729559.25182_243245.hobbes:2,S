The PF_MEMALLOC is required on usb-storage threads in 2.4, because ext3
will deadlock and otherwise misbehave when it's trying to write out
dirty pages under memory pressure.
I received a bug report today from an FC3T1 user with same symptoms
as 2.4. But I'm entirely clueless in the way VM operates. Comments?
