I've updated my patchset
http://members.optusnet.com.au/ckolivas/kernel/
It includes:
O(1) Batch scheduler
Preemptible
Low Latency
AA Virtual Memory additions
or
RMAP15d VM
Read Latency2
Supermount
XFS1.2pre5
ACPI
Desktop Tuning
optional compressed caching
Split out patches are available.
Changes:
small O(1) bugfixes
updated rmap option
Updated supermount
Updated xfs file system
Desktop tuning now has smaller timeslices across the
board, with altered tuning of the O(1) scheduler.
Removed:
Alsa - the aging 0.90rc2 patches. Just take the
sources from alsa-project.org, add water and compile
after your kernel is cooked
Variable timeslice - Smaller timeslices across the
board achieve a similar effect without added code
Please test carefully, especially those using xfs as
this code I have not tested extensively.
