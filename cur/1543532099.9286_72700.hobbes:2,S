That's precisely why "you are not allowed to think you have any space
guaranteed" after malloc(). If you assume malloc() allocates anything,
that's bad programming. There are other ways to get "guaranteed space".
I've never said there's something wrong with brk(). I've said that
an aplication MAY need to take control over the mm of its address space.
Most of the applications need not, so they use just malloc(). And get
killed at OOM.

Large jobs, with a large stack, usually let their stack grow in a
uncontrolled way.
So they can't predict how much stack they need, and can't ask for any
"reservation", either memory or swap. They'll risk to run out of stack
anyway.
Every process that asks for a "reserved" swap space for its stack, runs
with a "fixed" stack. So has to keep stack utilization under control
(e.g. no recursion). You can keep your stack small, if you control it.
So, just providing a way to mlock() your stack (its maximum size),
should be enough. No need to do swap reservation.
