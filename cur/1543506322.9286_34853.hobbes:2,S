Indeed.

That's why I hate the notion of drives trying to do their own page table
walking. Especially with SMP there are some rather subtle issues, and it's
just hard to get right. The rawio interface also has the added advantage
of forcing some organization onto the driver - you can't do page table
walking from interrupts, for example, even though some driver writers have
tried..
So yes, something using the rawio interfaces is ok, at least that way when
something in the memory management changes I won't have to worry about
random drivers breaking..
