As in inode->i_nlink == 0?  Yes, if you can prove that only this one
thread still has it open.  How to deal with multithreaded processes?
I don't know and would default to "write it back" again.
Besides, writing the dirty pages to backing store can only hurt
performance, never correctness.  The data could already be synced at
the time of the madvice call anyway.
