Another me too for this feature. I really want to be able to use this
on the large NUMA boxes - it takes me 5 minutes to do a full reboot
cycle, and I can't even do an init 6 due to some firmware complications,
I have to do init 0, power off, power on, boot, etc. Whilst I have
a remote power interface, it's still a pain in the butt.
kexec would be Nirvana ;-)
