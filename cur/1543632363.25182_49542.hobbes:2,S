Not bad, I suppose different people prefer different approaches, anyway. 
There is, however, still redundant output there, the "-o vt.o" and 
"KBUILD_BASENAME=vt" should go away as well too, IMO.
Anyway, I'll be out of town for a couple of days, if you want to see what
I'm up to, take a look at linux-isdn.bkbits.net, linux-2.5.make and
linux-2.5.make-new - What I'm doing for the quiet output is pretty
flexible, it can be easily adapted to things like the above.
I'd surely appreciate if people wanted to test things, if you don't have
bitkeeper but want to give it a shot, I can mail a patch.
(For the visually most prominent change, add "quiet" to your make command
line, or set KBUILD_QUIET=1 in the environment)
