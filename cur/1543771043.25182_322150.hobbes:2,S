Daniel, 
I'll start taking a closer look at it tomorrow, but on first working
with it, you might want to change the following config on
PRIORITY_INHERITANCE.  At least for me on a "make oldconfig" the default
is usually "No" so I made the following change. It may even be wise to
just force it. I haven't taking a look yet, but would PREEMPT_RT work
without the inheritance?
