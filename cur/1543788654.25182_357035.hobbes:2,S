I have to admit being surprised to see this because I have been using an SMP 
machine for a few years and not noticed a consistent or reproducible problem 
here. However, I have to admit the majority of my isochronous usage on kernel 
2.6 has been using the new API and implementation (aka rawiso and 
libiec61883). So, I tested your program on my dual Athlon running a 2.6.12 
SMP kernel, and it worked fine a few times when run manually. Then, I put it 
into a shell loop:
I="0"; while [ $I -lt 1000 ]; do ./raw1394reader_nothreads; \
echo ran iteration $I; I=`expr $I + 1`; done
Eventually, it did deadlock. So, I applied the patch, and the above looping 
test ran fine 3 times.Works for me.
