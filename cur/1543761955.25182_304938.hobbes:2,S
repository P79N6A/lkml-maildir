yes, it bloats memory usage, and complicates PI quite significantly. 
We've been there and have done something similar to that in earlier -RT
patches - 64 'owner' entries in the lock already caused problems on 8K
stacks. 32 seemed to work but caused quite some bloat in data structure
sizes.
i'd rather live with some scalability bottleneck for now, in exchange of
a wastly easier to handle design. We can still complicate things later
on for better scalability, once all the other issues have been sorted
out.
