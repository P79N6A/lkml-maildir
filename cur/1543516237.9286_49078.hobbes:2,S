Regardless of whether there's a bug, you might need to handle SIGIO.
It's sent if the RT queue overflows, and tells you to clear the
signal queue and fall back to normal poll() processing for a moment.
So you should be blocking SIGIO as well, and if sigwaitinf gets it,
have it clear the queue and call poll() once.
See 
http://www.kegel.com/c10k.html#sigio
 for a few notes.
I'm fuzzy on the details of who gets sent the SIGIO in a 
multithreaded program, though, or how well this works
in programs that use several realtime signals for
different groups of fd's.  sct?
