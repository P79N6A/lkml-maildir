it is the same category of problems: xine and X are both applications,
which, if lagged, are noticed by users. xine can be a perfectly fine CPU
hog when playing back DVDs. It can also be a mostly interactive task
playing back music mostly. For xine it's not just that audio skipping that
gets noticed, it's also the video-playback jerkiness that can be noticed
by users.
