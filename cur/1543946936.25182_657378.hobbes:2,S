Now I see it could be even stranger: it *is* visible by default(!)
after make defconfig. make menuconfig does something else: it seems
to "help me" and sees some other config (current kernel is in other
directory) even after deleting .config and make mrproper. So, maybe
this started because of this and the problem is with changing this
back.
