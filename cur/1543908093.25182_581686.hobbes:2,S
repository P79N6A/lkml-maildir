You didn't answer my question: are there any downsides to using
explicit coded-in-assembler accesses for atomic accesses?  You
can handwave all you want that it should "just work" with
volatile accesses, but volatility != atomicity, volatile in C
is really badly defined, GCC never officially gave stronger
guarantees, and we have a bugzilla full of PRs to show what a
minefield it is.
So, why not use the well-defined alternative?
