of course, we never used initrd blkdev, we just use the ramdisk always
from userspace.  Initrd doesn't need to be a blockdev, we could just
copy the ram ourself and just call ->write on the ramdisk. userspace
just sees /dev/ram0, /dev/initrd is a kernel internal thing that doesn't
need to be visible, and if anybody uses /dev/initrd somehow that just
insane (and it doesn't even look possible to make anything useful out of
/dev/initrd anyways).

1) I am tentated to fix the initrd bug by just killing initrd blkdev,
completly instead of going to mark PageSecure all the initrd pages.
2) Otherwise I can make a brute hack one liner approch with a global
field that ignores the PageSecure bit on reads until I finished to fill
in the /dev/ram0 :) (slowdown production paths for a boot thing but
doesn't matter, but ok we aren't writing proprietary software here and
this isn't the right thing ;)
3) I can just mark the initrd pages as PageSecure, then I can safely
forget about them.
What do you prefer for the next 2.4.10 mainline? I'd like to have this
fixed _fast_ and to be included in mainline, since the security problem
is ugly (not too bad though since /dev/ram0 is readable only by root by
default) and because people really needs initrd.
Suggestions are very welcome.
