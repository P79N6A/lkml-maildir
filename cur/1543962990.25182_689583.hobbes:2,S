A good idea to untangle this, but I'm not entirely happy with how it's
done.
utimes_need_permission is a good helper and fine with me.
utimes_common is a good idea aswell, but I'd rather take the permission
checks into it aswell, even if that means a little flag telling if
file->f_mode should be checked or vfs_permission().
do_fd_utimes sounds fine, but I don't like that name.  do_futimes maybe?
and when the fd-side is sorted out the path side should probably be a
helper aswell.  Then sys_utime/sys_utimes/arhc bits could call it directly,
with the initial check in do_utimes separated out into a helper ala
utimes_need_permission.  do_utimes should probably become do_futimesat
at the point.
