So threading init will work just fine.  The only case that will blow up
is calling exec from something that is not the thread group leader.
i.e.  If tgid == 1 but pid != 1 the kernel will cause pid == 1 to exit.
I think that will trigger a kernel panic.  It might just ensure that
no more processes are re-parented to init.  And we dereference a
bad pointer we look at child_reaper.  I haven't been brave enough
to try it.
The cost is only paid if you are a threaded task and you call exec.
Normal process never take that path, so we are already off of the
fast path.
The test when all expanded out is only:
if ((current->tgid == current->pid) && (current->tgid == 1))
	return -EINVAL
So it should be relatively cheap.
If process id namespaces become a reality init stops being
terribly special, and becomes something you may have several
of running at any one time.  If one of those inits is compromised
by a hostile user I having the whole system go down so we can
avoid executing a cheap test sounds terribly wrong.  That is
why I really care.
