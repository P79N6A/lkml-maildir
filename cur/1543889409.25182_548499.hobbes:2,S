+Slab validation
+---------------

+SLUB can validate all object if the kernel was booted with slub_debug. In

+@@@ SLUB kmalloc-8: Restoring redzone (0xcc) from 0xc90f6d28-0xc90f6d2b
+
+
+
+If SLUB encounters a corrupted object then it will perform the following
+actions:
+
+1. Isolation and report of the issue
+
+This will be a message in the system log starting with
+
+*** SLUB <slab cache affected>: <What went wrong>@<object address>
+offset=<offset of object into slab> flags=<slabflags>
+inuse=<objects in use in this slab> freelist=<first free object in slab>
+
+2. Report on how the problem was dealt with in order to ensure the continued
+operation of the system.
+
+These are messages in the system log beginning with
+
+@@@ SLUB <slab cache affected>: <corrective action taken>
+
+
+In the above sample SLUB found that the Redzone of an active object has
+been overwritten. Here a string of 8 characters was written into a slab that
+has the length of 8 characters. However, a 8 character string needs a
+terminating 0. That zero has overwritten the first byte of the Redzone field.
+After reporting the details of the issue encountered the @@@ SLUB message
+tell us that SLUB has restored the redzone to its proper value and then
+system operations continue.
+
+Various types of lines can follow the @@@ SLUB line:
+
+Bytes b4 <address> : <bytes>
+	Show a few bytes before the object where the problem was detected.
+	Can be useful if the corruption does not stop with the start of the
+	object.
+
+Object <address> : <bytes>
+	The bytes of the object. If the object is inactive then the bytes
+	typically contain poisoning values. Any non-poison value shows a
+	corruption by a write after free.
+
+Redzone <address> : <bytes>
+	The redzone following the object. The redzone is used to detect
+	writes after the object. All bytes should always have the same
+	value. If there is any deviation then it is due to a write after
+	the object boundary.
+
+Freepointer
+	The pointer to the next free object in the slab. May become
+	corrupted if overwriting continues after the red zone.
+
+Last alloc:
+Last free:
+	Shows the address from which the object was allocated/freed last.
+	We note the pid, the time and the CPU that did so. This is usually
+	the most useful information to figure out where things went wrong.
+	Here get_modalias() did an kmalloc(8) instead of a kmalloc(9).
+
+Filler <address> : <bytes>
+	Unused data to fill up the space in order to get the next object
+	properly aligned. In the debug case we make sure that there are
+	at least 4 bytes of filler. This allow for the detection of writes
+	before the object.
+
+Following the filler will be a stackdump. That stackdump describes the
+location where the error was detected. The cause of the corruption is more
+likely to be found by looking at the information about the last alloc / free.
