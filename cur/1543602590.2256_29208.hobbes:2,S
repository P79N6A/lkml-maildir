That is totally broken, because I may mount the disk in between
the suspend and resume. I might even:
1. boot kernel X
2. suspend kernel X
3. boot kernel Y
4. suspend kernel Y
5. resume kernel X
6. suspend kernel X
7. resume kernel Y
8. suspend kernel Y
9. goto #5
You really have to close the logs and mark the disks clean
when you suspend. The problems here are similar the the ones
NFS faces. Between the suspend and resume, filesystems may be
modified in arbitrary ways.
