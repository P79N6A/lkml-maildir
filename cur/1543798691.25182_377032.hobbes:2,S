Hi,
Here are 4 patches against your latest 2.6.15-git tree.  They fix the
following problems and should all go in for 2.6.15:
	- kernel oops in pci code for some thinkpads and other boxes.
	- kernel oops if pci express and pci express hotplug is built
	  into the kernel, instead of a module.
	- build breakage in a i2c driver.
	- memory barriers are needed for USB uhci driver in
	  suspend/resume path, as they were accidentally dropped in a
	  previous patch.
thanks,
greg k-h
