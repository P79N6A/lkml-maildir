That's what I prepare first, but then noticed it's not in mainline.

He should, as the fix is not in mainline either :-(
I don't think Greg asks for specific clarification, just a plain patch
with a short commit log on its own which does not include remains of
older mails.
I'm holding up the patch until I get confirmation that it is *at least*
queued for mainline, otherwise it will definitely be missing from
mainline.
Thanks Prakash for the pointers above.
