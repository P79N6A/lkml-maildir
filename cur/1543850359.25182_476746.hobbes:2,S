Could we please decide WTF _GPLONLY *is* and at least remain consistent?
Aside of "method of fighting binary-only modules", that is - this part
is obvious.
I'm not fond of ndiswrapper and stuff it uses, but AFAICS the list of
symbols it uses doesn't look like poking in the guts of kernel.
ISTR explanations along the lines of "well, it's for the stuff that
shouldn't be used by out-of-tree code".  Does anybody still subscribe
to that or should that be considered a pure smokescreen?
