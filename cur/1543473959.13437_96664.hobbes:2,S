	From: Thomas Molina <tmolina@probe.net>
	Updating util-linux to 2.9 requires an updated libslang.
False.
	So now I have several choices.  I can choose to not update util-linux, I
	can chase down all dependencies and upgrade, or go whole hog (!?) and do
	a full rawhide upgrade.  The least objectionable of these choices is
	sticking with util-linux 2.8.  What will break if I do that?
	Changes says the updated package takes care of > 128M swap partition and
	has an updated mount utility.  Since my single swap partition is 72M,
	and I'm not using NFS, automount, pcmcia, or other esoterica will I be
	safe?
Only minor things have been changed. See below.
util-linux 2.9h:
* mount recognizes "uid=useruid" and "gid=usergid" in /etc/fstab.
util-linux 2.9g:
* mount updates (locking, "users" keyword, "/etc/filesystems",
  "proto" and "vers" options in nfsmount, ...)
util-linux 2.9f:
* made ul handle lines of arbitrary length (Scott Maxwell)
* killed some C/H/S nonsense in fdisk
* fixes for archs with unsigned char type (Ambrose Li)
* fdisk fixes for power pc (Tom Rini)
* added a define for NCURSES_CONST
* fixes for list of signals in kill.c
* fixes for user name length in last.c
util-linux 2.9e:
* added a forgotten declaration to login.c (Christian Oyarzun)
util-linux 2.9d:
* fixed segfault in umount caused by Wilcox' patch (Steffen Zahn)
* added lnz stuff to fdisk
util-linux 2.9c:
* refixed PAM stuff in login.c that was broken in 2.8.
util-linux 2.9b:
* split README into INSTALL and HISTORY
* added a sentence to swapon.8
* behaviour of write on non-ASCII fixed
* hwclock adapted to survive a failing mktime()
util-linux 2.9a:
* added an include to lib/my_reboot.c so that __GLIBC__ is defined
* added setlocale() to login-utils/chfn.c
* do not recompute MAIL in login-utils/login.c
util-linux 2.9:
HIGHLIGHTS for version 2.9:
1) Removed programs:
   - strings. There is a version in binutils.
   - frag. (Moved to historic in 2.4, crept back in 2.5. Gone again.)
1a) Not yet removed program:
   - setfdprm. It also is in fdutils-5.2 (with an exceptionally
     ugly man page).
1b) Removed directory:
   - bsd. (The routine getopt() is in libc. err() moved to lib.)
2) Improvements:
   - ddate has been fixed to count down to the new, right X-day
   - look is now willing to search non-English dictionaries
     (i.e., uses locale)
   - cal now knows that Dutch day abbreviations have length 2 only
   - mcookie does not block when no random stuff is available
   - shutdown got a configuration file /etc/shutdown.conf
   - fdisk now reads SGI disk labels (thanks to Andreas Neuper)
   - mkswap now knows about new swap areas; mkswap.8 has been rewritten
   - umount knows about umount2() and forced unmounting of nfs mounts
   - mount is now willing to handle file names with embedded spaces
   - mount can now mount things by UUID or volume name
3) Uglifications:
   - swap.h has been replaced by a private swap_constants.h since
     <linux/swap.h> does not compile
   - reboot has become a private routine, since libc5 and glibc2 conflict
   - a mkminix-0.1 directory contains some patches to let mkfs.minix
     work under DOS. (Untested.)
4) Numerous other small changes.
