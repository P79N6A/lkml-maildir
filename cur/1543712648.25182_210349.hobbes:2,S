so suspend to disk does not work with scsi?

implies IDE is needed.
btw: would it be somehow possible to resume after initrd phase?
or some other idea how a generic kernel with modules in the initrd
could use suspend to disk? or a laptop where the initrd is needed
to setup a dm-crypt volume with the right decrypton key?
