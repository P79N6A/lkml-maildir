Yes, or setup a parent/child relationship.  So I think the first
process in a container would always get two pids.

That is the idea.
I actually expect the implementation to look very much different.
To me the nice piece of this concept is that it allows all pids
to local to a pid space while still be able to talk to remote
processes.
