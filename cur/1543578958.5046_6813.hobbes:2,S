This patch for the RoadRunner HIPPI driver includes:
* Fix crash on null dereference in rr_interrupt due to firmware bug
* Fix crash on null dereference in rr_interrupt with better link ON/OFF
  handling
* Fix crash due to NIC continuing to DMA after HALT (requires firmware
  >= 2.0.67)
Plus numerous smaller bugfixes and features.  Patches are available
against 2.2.18 and 2.4.0.  The patches are too big to post on the
list, so here's the URL (with more details on the patch):

Sorry for the big patch, I'll be happy to create a subset of the patch
for anyone who doesn't want to merge the whole thing.
Credit goes mainly to Kurt Ferreira <kurdt@nmt.edu>, also of Essential
Communications.
