You have to bridge L5-4 on the newest XP CPUs though.  My Tyan Tiger 
boards' BIOS was giving me something like-
00Error
  Failed
Turned out it needed those guys bridged up.  It's not that difficult 
though, I had a circuit pen lying about and just drew in a trace :).  
(You don't have to fill the cracks like the overclock bridges)
Anyway, it was pretty easy, but I wouldn't suggest it for the faint 
of heart.  Running 2.4.18 happily now in dual config with no 
stability problems.  I have compiled the kernel a few times, compiled 
Qt, all of KDE, xemacs, glibc, gcc, and a couple billion other things 
that I can't remember right now.  So, no stability problems with the 
newest XPs and a hand closed L5-4 bridge.  (So far anyway :) )
Thanks,
Shane Nay.
