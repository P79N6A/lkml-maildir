We can do that. The owner of a category can be a mailing list 
(eg the bugme-janitors list for some of the categories).

The idea is to spread it across categories (one person for each (or a few)
categories), but if you want to spread it around within a category that's 
possible too.

No. If you don't want to participate, that's fine, but I'm not going
to prevent other people from doing so. 
If you want me to forward the bugs to any given list, I'll do that. 
If you want to just tell people to file them to a list, that's fine too.
But I won't destroy the generic model just because you don't like it.
