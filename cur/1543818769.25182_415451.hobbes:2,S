So back to the core aim of this thread.
i386 -> x86_64: 32bit migration should work, but may be a little
confusing with the increase in VM space.  (I wonder how this
interacts with the kernels vdso).  
x86_64 -> i386 is likely to use addresses between 3GB and 4GB
and thus the migration probably will not work.  Unless the VM
accessible to user space is capped at 3G.
Odd.  But address space layout looks like one of the easiest migraion
problem to solve.
