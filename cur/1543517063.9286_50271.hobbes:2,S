The attached patch is basically showing the full impact of any attempt
to
enhance the kdev_t struct handling inside the current linux kernel.
Of course it isn't intended to be applyed to any kind of "production
system".
It is taking the pants off from many *many* of the places where there
are fundamental flaws in the current design :-(. Really indeed it's all
looking very scary...
However this is something that has to be done anyway. Better sooner then
later.
(In fact I get somehow the feeling that it's already too late.)
I hope that people responsible for the particular pieces will take it
as documentation for where there is a strong need for cleanup.
In esp. for example the serial driver and the block hash should
be cleaned up immediately.
I'm open to any kind of suggestions.
Whoever sponsored the RAW device implementation could have as well
burned the
money... This is once again a half done solution on top of a basically
flawed ground,
which is just adding unneccesary complexity to a poper resolution of
the involved issues.
