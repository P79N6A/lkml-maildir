Agree.

   I think this is a bad idea. This has been tried before. In the 
opensource community there is no such a thing as a standard library. 
We can see that with directfb and X windows, sdl, gtk/qt embedded, etc. 
Understand that I have no problem with having lots of libraries. Its 
just the reality is your library will be just one amoung many. 
   The time will come when someone will send you a patch and you will 
reject it and then the person will go off and make his/her own library.
Or someone will look at your work and say I can do better. Then we end
up with a bunch of libraries doing basically similiar things. Which one 
does the developer use then? We can't force them to use the "standard"
one. 
    The kernel really needs to be the only state machine for the hardware. 
Library developers will usually use the kernel standard interfaces.

I like to see the D-BUS pick up these events :-) It would come in handy 
for the JVMs I work on.

I agree they have to be merged.

Bad idea.
