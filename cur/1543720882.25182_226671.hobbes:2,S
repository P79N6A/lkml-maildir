Hi!
I found no other place, so I'll ask here.
I have a problem booting linux with grub ( v 0.9.something ).
I use the commands ( in the grub shell that boots from my HD ):
root (hd0,0)
kernel /vmlinuz-2.6.xxx ro root=dev/hda2
initrd /initrd-2.xxx
boot
After entering the "boot" command, the screen is cleared and then nothing
happens for 93 seconds.
After that linux boot normally ( beginning with the message "Uncompressing
linux..." and so on ).
If I trim the kernel command line to only "kernel /vmlinuz-2.6.xxx ro" ,
then the delay is 10 seconds.
If I change the operating mode of the IDE adapter in BIOS to RAID, then the
delay is infinite ( I waited
8 hours ). Note that GRUB still loads andit can browse and "cat" files on
the disk, so it is not a disk
access problem.
Can someone tell me how to find out what GRUB is doing after the "boot"
command ?
I tried to run "debug on" first, but it makes no change at all.
Maybe this is a linux kernel problem.
Any help appreciated !
Regards,
David Balažic
P.S.: It is a Fedora Core 2 system, the exact version numbers are
grub-0.94-5 , kernel-2.6.5-1.358
P.P.S.: I know this is Red Hat related, but my question is general : What is
happening between
the GRUB "boot" command and linux printing "Uncompressing linux..." ?
