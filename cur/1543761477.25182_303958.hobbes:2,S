the inefficiency will be larger, because (as explained in a previous
mail) multiple concurrent owners of the read-lock are not allowed. This
adds to the overhead of PREEMPT_RT on SMP, but is an intentional
tradeoff. I dont expect PREEMPT_RT to be used on an Altix :-|
#5 is still the best option, because in the normal 'infrequent
preemption' case it will behave in a cache-friendly way. A positive
effect of the lock serializing is that the callback backlog will stay
relatively small and that the RCU backlog processing can be made
deterministic as well (if needed), by making the backlog processing
thread(s) SCHED_FIFO.
