By the time you killed a handful of procs, the other half spawned new ones.
You can try stopping forkbombs by "killall -STOP nameofprog" and then 
"killall -9 nameofprog".
But you probably won't get to run killall in case of a thrasher running within 
the limits of `ulimit -m` and `ulimit -u`:
  perl -e 'fork,$_="x"x 10E6 while 1'
