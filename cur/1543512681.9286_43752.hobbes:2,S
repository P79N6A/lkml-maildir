I have an old LST 1.8 distribution on CD here, containing a full Linux
distribution with kernel 1.0.9, gcc of the same age, XFree 2.something and
a load of other tools. Runs fine in VMWare :-)
If anyone wants those bits I can put them up my FTP server. most of the
utilities are just a couple MB... the whole distribution is a boggling
120MB (or something) in size (wow!!). :-)

Windows NT indeed has very low Total Cost of Ownership. Trouble is,
Microsoft _owns_ Windows NT. You just licensed it.
