??? Wait-a-bloody-minute, but VFS doesn't pass _any_ struct inode * to
->rename() since 2.1.something.

Then you are screwed. Big way. BTDT and it still aches. That's what msdosfs
and VFAT used to do and boy, what a shitload of races they had... Fixing
took 4 months and it was not pretty. Probably I can help you with that
mess.

You should have ->i_ino
	a) constant over the lifetime of in-core inode
	b) unique. And that includes opened-but-unlinked inodes too.
And yes, in case of filesystem that lacks such invariants it is painful.
Please, describe the fs layout - hopefully the trick I've used for
FAT-derived filesystems will work, but I need more details.
For general description of the trick (badly written - sorry) see the
posting to fsdevel back in May '99...
<looking in archives> Aha, here it is:
http://kernelnotes.org/lnxlists/linux-fsdevel/lv_9905/msg00030.html
For more specific help - give me description of fs layout.
