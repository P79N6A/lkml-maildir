What makes you think that it is the driver that makes problem ?
How behaves the other one (NCR53C8XX/ncr53c8xx) ?
I am in fact very ennoyed about some PCI-HOST bridges that come from
non-PC world. This have been discussed recently about a SUN bridge. I have
read some documentation on existing PCI bridges (docs available on the
Net). For now, I only have found a bridge from IBM that seems to be
compliant enough with PCI specs so that it will not make problems with PCI
device drivers that do not know of those particular bridges (that just
miss the ordering rules that address consistency issues in PCI). 
Yours, for example, seems to only be featured of the following 'flushing'
rules an of no 'ordering' rules at all: (excerpt from the 21172 doc) 
- Before a read transaction to an I/O location is processed, all preceding 
  write transactions to devices are flushed out of the buffers.
- Before a read transaction from a PCI device to main memory is 
  processed, all preceding write transactions by the PCI device to main 
  memory are flushed out the buffer.
The consistency issue is addressed by PCI by ordering rules that applies 
to posted transactions in _both_ directions when a read transaction 
crosses the bridge.
My understanding of the behaviour of the 21172 may be just wrong, but the
bridge behaviour I quoted above can be easily worked around by drivers by:
1 - Performing a read (dummy) from the device to memory before raising 
    interrupt.
2 - performing a read (dummy) from the C code to an IO register from the 
    C code before scanning the flags that indicate completion.
Note that I may have missed something important in the 21172 bridge
documentation. If I did, then I expect to be fixed very quickly. :-)
I am currently studying how to safely support some bridges that do not
follow the PCI ordering rules and will provide some conditionnal code for
that before the end of August for the ncr/sym drivers. Obviously I can do
nothing for bridges I haven't any documentation about, or that are too 
much broken.
Note that it is not proven that your problem is caused by some
inconsistency due to bridge a misfeature that victimized the driver.
