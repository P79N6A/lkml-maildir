Subject: [PATCH/RFC 2.6.21 0/5] ehca: remove use of do_mmap() from kernel space

Hello Roland and Christoph H.!
Here is a set of patches for ehca, whose main purpose is to remove unproper use of
do_mmap() in ehca kernel space as suggested by Christoph H. Other "small" changes
are:
* Remove "dead" prototype declarations (those without code implementation)
Now detail on mmap() rework:
- For eHCA hardware register block we use remap_pfn_range() as previously.
- For queue pages we call pattern vm_insert_page() to register each allocated
kernel page.
- For each mmap-ed resource (hardware register block, send/recv and completion
queue) we introduce a use counter that is incremented and decremented by
the call-backs open()/close(). Destroying a completion queue or queue pair
will succeed only if all associated counters are zero. That means those resources
must be mmap-ed and munmap-ed properly in user space.
The actual calls of mmap64() and munmap() are done then in ehca user space lib,
ie. libehca, for which I will send a separate patch for another review (by ofed
group).
Thanks
Nam
