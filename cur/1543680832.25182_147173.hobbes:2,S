Ok, I have rechecked the errata docs. I have not found any 
recommandation change for PCI compliance configuration registers.
And one interesting thing:
in the AMD762 datasheet (24462.pdf) page 231 (Recommanded BIOS 
settings), I can see this: "Numerical Values shown with h or b are 
preferred settings." ; and AMD recommand this:
-> set bits 2 and 1 of register 0x4C to "0b"
-> set bits 23 and 3 respectively to "0b" and "1b"
I can confirm that these settings works much more better, even if they 
don't exactly follow PCI specs. And I don't think this is specific to my 
  cards since I have tested others.
Furthermore, my AMD762 is revision B1 (just before the last one: C0), 
and my AMD768 revision is B2, the last one.
Would you accept I make a patch which doesn't make any change in these 
registers at least up to AMD762 revision B1 (ie keeping recommanded 
values from AMD) ?
Or could you propose an other solution ?
Regards,
