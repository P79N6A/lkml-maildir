I was just taking a closer look at bio_add_page and there is some code
that doesn't mage sense.  The following patch explains the problem and
suggests a possible fix.

==================================================
Fix strange code in bio_add_page
With the current code in bio_add_page, if fail_segments is ever set,
it stays set, so bio_add_page will eventually fail having recounted
the segmentation once.
I don't think this is intended.  This patch changes the code to allow
success if the recounting the segments helps.
