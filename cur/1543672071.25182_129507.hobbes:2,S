Alan, have you had any better luck talking to Intel than I had? At least
you are a well known person in the Linux environment and have a lot more
clout than when a complete nobody like me tries to get their attention.
Getting the wireless working would be a great step forward.

Eventually things will work in favour of linux. It usually does. The
time it might take to get there is a variable factor though. Personally
I thought Centrino was a good idea. I normally don't like 'Chipzilla'
but in this instance I think they did a good thing.
