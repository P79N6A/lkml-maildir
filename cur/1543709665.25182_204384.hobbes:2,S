I still don't know about MySQL, but I have just encounted some code of
my own which does break if time() returns significantly out of date
values.
Any code which is structured like this will break:
	time_t timeout = time(0) + TIMEOUT_IN_SECONDS;
	do {
		/* Do some stuff which takes a little while. */
	} while (time(0) <= timeout);
It goes wrong when time() returns a value that is in the past, and
then jumps forward to the correct time suddenly.  The timeout of the
above code is reduced by the size of that jump.  If the jump is larger
than TIMEOUT_IN_SECONDS, the timeout mechanism is defeated completely.
That sort of code is a prime candidate for the method of using a
worker thread updating a global variable, so it's really important to
to take care when using it.
