I have an AMD Athlon64 with Radeon 9200SE on VIA K8T800 Chipset... and
AGP works fine with only CONFIG_AGP_AMD64 enabled.
The fact is that these AMD processors have an "on-CPU northbridge" for
AGP, and the support for the various external AGP bridges (VIA, SiS,
Nvidia) is provided directly in "drivers/char/agp/amd64-agp.c" driver
(selected by CONFIG_AGP_AMD64).
Reading "drivers/char/agp/amd64-agp.c" I can see that "SIS 755" chipset
is supported.
If you have a chipset that isn't supported you can always try with the
"agp_try_unsupported=1" option (as stated in the HELP of
CONFIG_AGP_AMD64).

You don't have to be on a i386 to see the options avaiable for i386...
just do a "make menuconfig ARCH=i386" and you are done!
But if you are on x86_64, why do you want to enable drivers for other
architectures?
