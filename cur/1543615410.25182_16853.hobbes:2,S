The probability is rather low, as the 486 cores are definitely a dying
species. AMD is, as many other manufacturers, going the 586 way on it's
embedded roadmaps, as modern embedded 586 cores have the same low power
requirements and there are designs available which have all the advantages
of the [34]86s but a more modern core and stuff like PCI interfaces.
But nevertheless, relying on assumptions is no good design, so we should
stay with the current solution. If somebody adds stuff for the SC520 it
should be no problem to add something for differentiation.
