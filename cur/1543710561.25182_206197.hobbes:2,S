Agreed.

That's not a problem either.  Have a userspace program that checks all
files and hints for identical ones (new syscall, copyfile() cannot do
this without races).  Depending on fs size, the necessary data can
grow into the gigabytes, but the code is just 200 lines.
Or did you mean the problem of tar backups growing *much* larger than
the real filesystem?  Yes, tar becomes useless for backups then. :)
