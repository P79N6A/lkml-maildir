I stand corrected. I can kexec an bzImage 32->64bit. That's a different
thing that it ran into some initrd issues later but fundamentally kexec
could load 64bit kernel bzImage and do the successful transition.
So it will now be left to the user. If he tries to kexec to a 64bit kernel
on a machine not supporting 32bit extensions, then kexec will not give
any advance warning.
