Just read Alans mails, doesn't really explain anything. But the segment
patch must be close, if limiting max transfer size to 7.5K works. Which
(in spirit, at least) is identical to the NetBSD work-around.
And why you would want to keep a work around like this under NDA (for a
bug that completely cripples the hardware) I don't understand at all,
seems pretty damn stupid to me. "Thanks for buying our hardware, yes
it's buggy and we wont tell you what the bug is. Please come again!"
