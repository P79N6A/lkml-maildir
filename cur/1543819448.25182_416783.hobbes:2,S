While I agree with the "freedom" part, I would not call the LSM
abstraction "nice". It's not. Part of the reason for that is that there
weren't more "real" users, only "ghost" ones, so fixing the interface to
fit the users hasn't been done. "removing" LSM seems to be an attempt to
fit the interface to all real users at the time. Once there's > 1, the
fix can be different ;)
