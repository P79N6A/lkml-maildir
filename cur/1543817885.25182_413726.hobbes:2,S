1. The calling convention of i386 requires that i386 function calls preserve ebp
(like esi).
2. Therefore, this will only affect code that actually looks at the
stack frame would
have to care.
3. Notice that profile_pc itself is compiled with frame pointers on in
this case and reads the PC [IP] of its own caller.
4. Therefore, the only thing that has to care is the kernel segfault handler.
The kernel segfault handler itself is not properly hardened against
this (it likes to generate recursive die() failure). I know: I've
smashed my own stack working on kernel code.
IMO, the problem here is not linking frame-pointer using code with
non-frame-pointer using code, but failing to harden the segfault
handler against a smashed stack frame
(which is exactly what using ebp as a general register looks like).
