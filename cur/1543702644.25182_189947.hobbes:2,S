> Did you ever try to disable the DMA as suggested?
I am sorry, Marcelo, that it took me so long.
In fact, I tried disabling the DMA and I could *not* get it to crash
without DMA. It did also not crash with DMA on for the onboard (VIA)
controller and off for the Promise. But when I turned DMA back on
for the Promise, it crashed again.
Martin Josefsson has suggested that the Promise controller may be
defective, and it certainly looks like that. I am now trying
a different Promise controller (20376 rather than the 20369, but
same driver), but it also crashes.
Thus, it looks like it's a problem with the driver, doesn't it? Or
either of the two disks. I will run badblocks over them on
a known-to-be-good controller when I get a chance.
If it's a problem with the driver, then I would be happy to help,
but I know nothing about these layers of the computer. I would,
however, give the controller away to someone eager to debug the
driver (provided the university will let me)!
Cheers,
