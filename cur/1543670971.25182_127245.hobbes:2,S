Yes.

The stuff used to boot, usually the relocated and shadowed
BIOS ROM, always exists at absolute address 0x000f0000. Since
a 'segment' is a 16-byte thing, the appropriate segment
is 0xf000.  The code must be there because the 'reset-vector'
is (must be) 16 bytes from the end of this segment. That's
the code that first gets control during the startup sequence.
The BIOS setup menus and other stuff is (typically) put down
at 0xe000. However many new BIOS uncompress some stuff from
NVRAM and put it anywhere they want because they 'own' all
the RAM in the system until an attempted boot.

If you use the string search primative I show, it will work.
