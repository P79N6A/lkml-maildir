Subject: [PATCH] drivers/sound/sb_card.c: ALS007 update for 2.3.48 with isapnp support
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

I've updated the ALS007 stuff in the Soundblaster driver mainly for isapnp.
Please test it and report me if it works or not.
regards, Gaël Quéri <gqueri@mail.dotcom.fr>

+To use an ALS-007 sound card under Linux, enable the following modules in the
 sound configuration section of the kernel config:
   - 100% Sound Blaster compatibles (SB16/32/64, ESS, Jazz16) support
   - FM synthesizer (YM3812/OPL-3) support 
-Since the ALS-007 is a PnP card, the sound driver probably should be
-compiled as a module, with the isapnptools used to wake up the sound card.
-Set the "I/O base for SB", "Sound Blaster IRQ" and "Sound Blaster DMA" (8 bit -
-either 0, 1 or 3) to the values used in your particular installation (they
-should match the values used to configure the card using isapnp).  The
-ALS-007 does NOT implement 16 bit DMA, so the "Sound Blaster 16 bit DMA"
-should be set to -1.  If you wish to use the external MPU-401 interface on
-the card, "MPU401 I/O base of SB16" and "SB MPU401 IRQ" should be set to
-the appropriate values for your installation.  (Note that the ALS-007
-requires a separate IRQ for the MPU-401, so don't specify -1 here).  (Note
-that the base port of the internal FM synth is fixed at 0x388 on the ALS007; 
-in any case the FM synth location cannot be set in the kernel configuration).
+Since the ALS-007 is a PnP card, you should also enable the following options
+in the Plug and Play section of the kernel config to configure the card
+automatically at startup:
+  - Plug and Play support
+  -   ISA Plug and Play support
+
+Alternatively, you can use isapnptools to wake up the sound card.
+You will then need to tell the module what is in /etc/isapnp.conf by adding
+a line in /etc/modules.conf like:
+options sb io=0x220 irq=5 dma=1 dma16=-1 mpu_io=0x330 mpu_irq=11
+These options are the same as in Documentation/Soundblaster except that:
+  - dma16 should always be set to -1
+  - the mpu401 has an irq that you have to set with mpu_irq
 
 The resulting sound driver will provide the following capabilities:
   - 8 and 16 bit audio playback
