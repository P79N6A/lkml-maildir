Can you try to see if you can get an "strace" snippet of X (or the window
manager) when this happens, since it seems to reproducible by you..
Also, I actually find it very surprising that you see X doing anything
_at_all_ with a pipe, since all the X connections should be just normal
sockets. There are no pipes involved anywhere afaik.
Your description sounds exactly like X is busy processing some slow
operation (or possibly the window manager, but I think virtual console
switches happen without the WM being involved). The most common such slow 
operation is a new font being generated, but I don't see why that would 
have anything to do with pipes either...
