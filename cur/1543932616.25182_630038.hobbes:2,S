The typical RNG is a noise diode or other similar hardware using thermal 
noise, so it's unlikely that anyone but God could predict it. There are 
some USB devices which supposedly use radioactive decay, I'm unsure if 
that's better but I don't want to carry the dongle in my pants pocket. 
The hotbits network site uses radioactive decay to generate it's numbers.
