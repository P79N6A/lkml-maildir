I've released the 5.1.14 version of the aic7xxx driver.  This driver
should fix the outstanding problems that I know of on all of the PCI
class adaptec controllers.  There may be some outstanding issues on EISA
controllers.  I will be verifying the EISA controllers later this week. 
There are several sections of code that underwent heavy modifications
though.  The most heavily modified is the device speed negotiation
code.  It's hoped that this code will be better than the previous code
was, but it is in need of testing.  Specifically, there are drives out
there that will initiate negotiation with the controller isntead of
waiting for the controller to start the negotiation process.  That has
traditionally been a spot of problems in the aic7xxx driver.  If some of
the people that have drives that initiate negotiation on their own could
try out this code and report back to me, I would greatly appreciate it.
The update can be found at ftp.redhat.com:/aic/5.1.14 and there are
patches against a clean 2.0.36 or a clean 2.2.5 kernel.
