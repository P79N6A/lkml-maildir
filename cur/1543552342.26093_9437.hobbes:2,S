Hi Linus,
  unfortunately, this does not explain problem I reported. In my case,
underlying fs is ext2, and there is no locking around - only one task
does ftruncate() on (big) shareable mapped file (original code does it to
prevent dirty pages to be written to disk after their contents is no
longer relevant). And for some reason, not all instance of shared mapping 
are invalidated - some are still connected to underyling pages, but 
these pages have page->mapping = NULL... (and no, in testcase there
is no vmware around). So on task exit kernel dies with page->mapping
dereference in filemap_write_page (->filemap_sync->filemap_unmap->exit_mmap->
->mmput->do_exit)...
                                    Thanks,
                                            Petr Vandrovec
