   I modified ah6_input() and esp6_input() to return zero instead of -EINVAL
   in the fix below. I tested it and it works.
   Please let me know if this is ok. 
I think it would be better if ipv6's upper-layer interface worked
like ipv4's.  ie. a < 0 return value means:
	next_proto =- ret;
	goto resubmit;
The less that is different between ipv4/ipv6 the better.
