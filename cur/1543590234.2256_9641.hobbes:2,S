In fact my patch isn't changing writepage behavior wrt. that page, it
is changing behavior with respect to laundering policy for that page.
Here, let's talk code a little bit so there are no misunderstandings,
I really want to put this to rest:
+		int dead_swap_page;
+
 		page = list_entry(page_lru, struct page, lru);
+		dead_swap_page =
+			(PageSwapCache(page) &&
+			 page_count(page) == (1 + !!page->buffers));
+
Calculate dead_swap_page outside of lock.
 		/* Page is or was in use?  Move it to the active list. */
-		if (PageTestandClearReferenced(page) || page->age > 0 ||
-				(!page->buffers && page_count(page) > 1) ||
-				page_ramdisk(page)) {
+		if (!dead_swap_page &&
+		    (PageTestandClearReferenced(page) || page->age > 0 ||
+		     (!page->buffers && page_count(page) > 1) ||
+		     page_ramdisk(page))) {
 			del_page_from_inactive_dirty_list(page);
 			add_page_to_active_list(page);
 			continue;
If dead_swap_page, ignore referenced bit heuristics.
-			/* First time through? Move it to the back of the list */
-			if (!launder_loop) {
+			/* First time through? Move it to the back of the list,
+			 * but not if it is a dead swap page. We want to reap
+			 * those as fast as possible.
+			 */
+			if (!launder_loop && !dead_swap_page) {
 				list_del(page_lru);
 				list_add(page_lru, &inactive_dirty_list);
 				UnlockPage(page);
If dead_swap_page, ignore launder_loop.  Again, another heuristic
test, not a "state correctness" test.  "launder_loop" is not
protecting "state correctness" of what we do to the page.
Really, what does this have to do with swap counts and page counts?
It's a heuristic. In fact it even seems stupid to me to recalculate
dead_swap_page after we get the lock just for the sake of these
heuristics.
Maybe I should have diguised this bit as:
if (dead_swap_page)
	do_writepage_first_pass = 1;
To divert people's brains to what the intent was :-)
