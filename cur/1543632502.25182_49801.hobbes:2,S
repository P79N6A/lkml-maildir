   On ppc64 I found that pcibios_init was being called before
   pci_driver_init, maybe its happening on alpha too. I am using the
   following hack for the moment, I'll leave it to Patrick to fix it properly.
It's happening on every platform.  It should be done before
arch_initcalls actually, but after core_initcalls.  I would suggest to
rename unused_initcall into postcore_iniscall, then use it for this
and sys_bus_init which has the same problem.
