What about using krefs to implement that?
see include/linux/kref.h
and lib/kref.c
Just embed that "struct kref" inside your struct fuse_file
struct fuse_file {
...
	struct kref ref;
...
}
init in struct fuse_file *fuse_file_alloc(void) where you added the counter.
...
kref_init(&ff->ref);
...
and implement the release function like:
static void fuse_file_release(struct kref *ff_ref)
{
	struct fuse_file *ff = container_of(ff_ref, struct fuse_file, ref);
        struct fuse_req *req = ff->reserved_req;
        struct fuse_conn *fc = get_fuse_conn(req->dentry->d_inode);
        request_send_background(fc, req);
        kfree(ff);
}
This will also fix the missing smp_barriers, is very simple, saves code,
makes your life easier and is a well known known kernel infrastructure :-)
BTW: FUSE rocks! :-)
You can add my "Signed-off-by: Ingo Oeser <ioe-lkml@rameria.de>",
if you want to use that suggestion.
