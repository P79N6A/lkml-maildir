POSIX says:
"the third argument can be cast to a pointer to an object of type
ucontext_t to refer to the receiving thread's context that was
interrupted when the signal was delivered."
so if uc_stack doesn't point to the stack in use immediately prior to
signal generation, this is a bug.
(In theory I should be able to pass the ucontext_t supplied to the
signal handler to setcontext() and resume execution exactly where I left
off -- glibc's refusal to support kernel-generated ucontexts gets in the
way of this, but the point still stands.)
I have no idea who to bother about i386 signal delivery, though. (And I
suspect this bug has probably been copied to other architectures as
well.)
