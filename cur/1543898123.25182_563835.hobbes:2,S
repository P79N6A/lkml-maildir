Okay, after a ridiculous amount of bisecting and recompiling and
rebooting...
First I had to find out that the kernel stops booting as of
bf50467204: "i386: Use per-cpu GDT immediately on boot"
(With theis commit, it silently stops booting.  The GP fault I
posted earlier comes a little later, but I didn't bother finding it.)
and starts again as of
b0b73cb41d: "i386: msr.h: be paranoid about types and parentheses"
However, one commit before the former suspends properly, and the latter
fails to suspend (exactly the same problem at get_fixed_ranges+0x9/0x60),
so I had to bisect further between the two, backporting the msr.h changes
across the msr-index.h splitoff.
Anyway, the patch which introduces the problem is the aptly named 3ebad:
3ebad59056: [PATCH] x86: Save and restore the fixed-range MTRRs of the BSP when suspending
2.6.22-rc6 plus that one commit reverted successfully does APM suspend
(and resume) for me.
