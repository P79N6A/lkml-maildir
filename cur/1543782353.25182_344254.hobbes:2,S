Hi John,
The command rdev can change the default root partition on x86 linux 
systems with pre-built kernels.
About the CONFIG_CMDLINE in the kernel configuration, I found it in lots 
of files in the kernel source tree and I'd like to know which file I 
need to change this value (/usr/src/linux/arch/ppc64/defconfig ?).

According to this doc: 
http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/eserver/library/es-SW_RAID_LINUX.html,
 
ppc64 can use zImage-style boot wrapper, so I'm trying it.
