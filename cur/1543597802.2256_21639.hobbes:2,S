What's difficult is that it doesn't happen to all of us. I can turn the 
volume up and down through XMMS or through the Gnome mixer without the 
slightest problem while playing MP3s. I haven't yet worked out the 
pattern which marks when this occurs.
Could people having this problem send me the following info, and I'll 
summarise any pattern I spot:
lspci -x of the Via southbridge function 5
Motherboard
Processor
Kernel/driver versions
AC97 Codec ID (IMPORTANT)
