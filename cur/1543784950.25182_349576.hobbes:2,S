James, people have _already_ replied to your point, saying
that they want to start with a _clean_ hardware model/interface.
See Alan and Andi's emails.
I don't know why do you keep grinding this, just like the
IDR thread (you had no other code to write?) and like the
"EH turned into ACA" thread?
It is time SCSI Core started cleanly, especially now with SAS
which will completely *replace* Parallel SCSI and IDE (for SATA).

"that may be necessary"?
You don't listen to anyone, do you?
Let's deal with those when they come.  The sas_ha_struct can certainly
deal with those as I pointed out in a previous email in this thread:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-scsi&m=112632556516797&w=2
We do not want to write code for things "that may be necessary".
This has been pointed out numerous times.
