Its trickier than that - because all your other semantics have to align,
its akin to the undelete problem (in fact its identical). Do you version on
a rewrite, on a truncate, only on an O_CREAT ?
In terms of where to stick versions, one popular unix solution seems to be
to put them in a .something directory  (eg the netapp filer)
