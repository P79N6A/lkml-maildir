Hmm, here's a question for you:  The old code was equivalent to "tsv- 
 >svv[0] = 1;", what's your proof that we don't rely on this "bug"  
elsewhere in the code?  In other words, this is a significant  
behavior change (albeit fixing an apparent bug) from what we've done  
for a while.  You might want to do a git-blame on this bit of code to  
see who the last person to modify it was and ask them to test or  
confirm the patch first.  The same general questions apply to the  
other logical-op bugs.
Cheers,
