Hello!
  I needed to write driver of block device. Roughly, I have some file
(assume /tmp/aaa) and I need to write kernel module, which implements
struct file_operations {
                          ....
 ssize_t (*read) (struct file *, char *, size_t, loff_t *);
 ssize_t (*write) (struct file *, const char *, size_t, loff_t *);
                          ....
};
read/write functions to my device... Then I want to do mknod /dev/aaa b ...
and I hope that /dev/aaa will appeared :) But, there are some problems...
First, I suppose that I must not use sdandart c libraries (libc.a) and I must
use some "kernel" library (i.e. I must not use fopen/../fclose functions)
But, I couldn't find this kernel library and even any file-operation function
in header's files in /usr/include/linux
Second, when I use standart library libc.a after linking I have a huge module 
(~1.2Mb!!!!) ... And module can't open my file...
Is anybody know where I can read some document/examples on this topic??
Bye...
P.S.  And I'm sorry for my ugly english... :)
