Subject: How to specify the interface via which the packet will be sent by that packet's source IP

I have 2 IP, say it, ip1 & ip2, they are in the same sub-network. ip1 is
a physical NIC's IP address and ip2 is that NIC's ip-aliases. I use
shaper to control the traffic over that 2 IPs. Now I have two network
device, eth0(ip1) and shaper0(ip2). Since shaper can only control the
outgoing packet. I need direct all outgoing packets with source ip1 to
eth0, and all outgoing packets with source ip2 to shaper0. How can I
realize it?
Thanks advance
