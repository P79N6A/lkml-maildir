Did nothing for me. gcc still got a sig11 after a while.
Took three runs of 'make bzImage' before it completed.
I wondered if I'd been unlucky enough to have been sent a
replacement K6-2 which was also screwed, but as I mentioned
earlier, this box runs fine under 2.2
btw, I was unsubscribed from all lists at vger yesterday,
for reasons currently unknown to me. Did this happen to anyone
else, or did my mail setup break something?
regards,
Davej.
