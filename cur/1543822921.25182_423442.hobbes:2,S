Interesting.  My guess is that the IOMMU is helping you out, and the
issue is that the silicon erratum applies to the I/O buffers too, not
just to a subset of the schedule data structures.
Can you confirm that this patch also resolves your issue?  Reboot
from scratch a few times (power off, warm reboot, etc) to be
reasonably sure you're seeing the cases that failed before.
Modify workaround for the EHCI quirk in newer NVidia controllers by
assigning the DMA mask, not just the consistent DMA mask.  It seems
to matter, as if the silicon erratum isn't quite what was described
in the original bug workaround (or there's another erratum).
