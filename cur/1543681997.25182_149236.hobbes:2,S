Are you sure about this?  My recollection from using the SF code was that Bass 
and Treble weren't there until you used the setup script that came with the 
package.  What that does is to load a piece of DSP code which provides extra 
functions.  It also has to set up the appropriate routings to enable the 
extra controls.
The insertion of arbitrary code and the easy setting up of routings are the 
two main things missing at the moment from the ALSA emu10k1 driver.  That's 
how it seems to me anyway.

OK, I was mistaken about this, there is a bass and treble control in 
alsamixer.  They even appear when it is run without a switch of any kind.  I 
can't see any mention of such a switch in the manual page either.  It does 
work, but you have to unmute the tone control switch to enable it.
