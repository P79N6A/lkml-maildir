I'm testing this patch on an at91sam9260 on 2.6.24-rt. I'm using this
patch with the tclib support for hrtimer and the clocksource pit_clk.
These are the results:
- Voluntary Kernel Preemption the system (crash)
- Preemptible  Kernel (crash)
/*
 * Drop the lock here since it might end up calling
 * uart_start(), which takes the lock.
   spin_unlock(&port->lock);
 */
    tty_flip_buffer_push(port->info->tty);
/*
    spin_lock(&port->lock);
 */
The same code with this comments out runs
Complete Preemption (Real-Time) ok but the serials is just unusable due
to too many overruns (just using lrz)
The system is stable and doesn't crash reverting this patch.
I don't test with the thread hardirqs active.

Is the kmalloc correct?
maybe:
data = kmalloc(ATMEL_SERIAL_RINGSIZE * sizeof(struct atmel_uart_char), 
GFP_KERNEL);

Why the tasklet_kill is not done in atmel_shutdown?
