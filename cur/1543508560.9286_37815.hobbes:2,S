Last ran 2.3.16.
In 2.3.17:
apcupsd fails to detect my UPS on /dev/ttyS1
get a few of these: "destory_semaphore: can not destroy sem."
dpkg gets a segmentation fault with just about any operation, strace shows
the last call is "sysinfo"... bug in dpkg or the kernel?  only the kernel
changed
I didn't try many other programs before dropping back to 2.3.16
Ongoing problems:
parallel port broken sometime after 2.3.5 (detects ECP/EPP port but
drivers are unable to communicate using it and fall back to PS/2)
I haven't had time to look into any of these yet.
