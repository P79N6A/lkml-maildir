I did have that.

Well no obligation exists, but please add "All code owned by Alan Cox
and present in this kernel is licensed GPL v2 or later" to your copying
or another appropriate file. (A comment in the code for each one would
be rather messy)
It might be a good idea to figure out how to have a list of contributors
who've said that or "v2 - or if Linus Torvalds so chooses, a later
version"

Correction noted. I went and checked 1.2.0 and indeed it says nothing
about versions in that specific top level file.
