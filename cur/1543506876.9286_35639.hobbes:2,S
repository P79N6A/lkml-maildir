I wonder if anyone can shed some light on this problem. When I switch
between virtual consoles (ALT-F1, etc.), I often get several random
characters/attributes showing up in random locations on the screen. While
the majority of the screen is intact, several switches in and out of a
terminal, it becomes garbled to the point the information in it is
useless. In the event it helps:
Kernel: 2.3.14 (problem occurred on 2.2 kernels as well)
System: 486 DX 33Mhz, 48MB RAM
Video: ATI Mach32, 2MB video RAM
Even just knowing why it happens would make me happy. :)
