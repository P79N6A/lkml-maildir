Brilliant. While in the graphics sector, cards and drivers always become fatter
and potentially less source-available than now, sound cards in contrast always
become thinner and more useless (while there is an open driver).
I cannot really use my onboard snd-intel8x0 because it lacks volume control on
Master/PCM (= blows every headphone away), etc.

Not rate limited, so that it fulls up nicely, and admins see it sooner. If 
it just makes one message per hour or so, it may eventually be handled by 
the logrotate turnaround. Be faster than logrotate :)
