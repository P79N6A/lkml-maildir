Umm.. how will this fail for *any* system that has a sane 'depmod' (sane as in
"calls exit(0) if it worked"?  In this patch we never actually check the
version - we just add code that "if depmod fails during 'make install_modules',
it may be too old and give them a hint".
(Incidentally, I tested it with the RH9 depmod, the Rusty depmod,  and the
Rawhide depmod - for Rusty and Rawhide it was silent, the older RH9 depmod
barfed and then gave the hint...)
