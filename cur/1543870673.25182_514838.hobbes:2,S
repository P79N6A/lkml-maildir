For the second time, I am going to ask you very nicely to
please post this instead to the Linux networking development
mailing list, located at netdev@vger.kernel.org
That is where you will reach the most people knowledgable in
the area of your problem report, networking developers mostly
do not read linux-kernel
Thank you.
