Normally we leave the I/O pending in the expectation that more readpage()
requests will occur.  This allow us to merge things in the disk request
queues.  We'll actually submit the I/O to the device if:
a) There's a lot of it pending or
b) There haven't been any more readpage() calls for a while or
c) Someone actually wants to wait on the I/O (say, via lock_page())
It is unusual that you want this I/O to kick off immediately.  You will
probably find that blk_run_backing_dev() will do what you want.
That's all for a 2.6 kernel - you didn't specify.  It it's a 2.4 kernel
then you'll need to use run_task_queue(&tq_disk) to flush the queued I/O
requests.
