I have read the RCF and I have to say that  I am left with the impression that 
relayfs and netlink are more or less orthogonal in what they try to achieve. 
If I'm wrong in this I'd like to know as I have no wish to push an 
alternative to any existing function of equivalent or  superior capability.
In messaging terms relayfs is more about he collation of parts of a message 
rather than the sending of multiple messages to a session partner. There are 
three aspects in which relayfs radically differs from netlink:
1) it does not require a partnership -- a client and serve, or session pair -- 
it is simply a buffering mechanism that allows data  be deposited. There is 
no expectation that the data will be consumed or that there is a listening 
partner. The reason fore this design point comes from the origin of relayfs 
as a buffering mechanism that satisfies the needs of a low-level system 
trace. Data from a trace might never be consumed if the system, sub-system or 
component never fails.
2) data can be deposited from any context - interrupt time, task time, sysinit 
in particular.
3) the depositing of data with relayfs has to depend one a very simple 
interface and infrastructure in order to function under a severely damaged 
system. My impression is that netlink depends a significant infrastructure.
Are these three points catered for by netlink?
