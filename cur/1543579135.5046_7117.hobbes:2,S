First, did the IDE driver detect the disks/partitions listed?
what does /proc/partitions, /proc/modules, and /proc/ioports
show in 2.4.0?
I switched from 2.2.x -> 2.4.0 with IDE RAID disks fine.
Using the RedHat7.0 default of raidtool-0.90
Try building the newer raidtools and make sure to use the
correct kernel headers (the ones for 2.4.0)
