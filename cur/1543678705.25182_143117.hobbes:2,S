Dear Sir,
I am  Mr Ken Titoh, I represent the members of
contract award committee of my country, Nigeria.
We managed to deposit the sum of $25 million in the
vault of Citi Bank of America (local branch).
These funds was acquired as gratification from various
contractors we have assisted in getting contracts. 
This fund was deposited without any account as a
result of civil service code, which does not allow us
to operate foreign account. I'm asking for your
assistance as a foreign partner to move this fund from
the vault of Citi Bank to your account, with you asthe beneficiary.
I will also need your assistance in the investment of
most of our share of the funds in your country,
in profitable areas of interest to us, especially
computer soft and hard wares. This is due fordiscussion as soon as we meet.
COMMISSION! You will be entitled to 15% of the total funds for
your assistance. If you are interested contact me
immediately through e-mail to let you know how to make
applications to the director of wire transfer of Citibank  for immediate transfer of the funds to your nominated account.
Regards
Mr ken Titoh
