:-) Nobody has POSIX standards available around. I'll have it ordered by
the library.
Perhaps documenting the Linux kernel ioctl's and other settings would be a
step in the right direction. The only information I had about TIOCMGET/SET
was reading gpm sources.

The problem is not DTR, but RTS. I don't care whether the kernel moves
DTR, but I don't understand why it would touch RTS even when we are
-crtscts (it pulls RTS low for a little period).

Writing code using functions that are NOT documented in the only help of
the system, using header files as reference, is surely error-prone.
Clearly, we need some documentation on such issues, since saying "Just
read spec XXX", where spec XXX is a document that is available for a
costly fee from an institution on the other side of the globe is NOT a
satisfactory answer.
I volunteer to write something clear on the subject of RS232 I/O under
Linux (not this week, since I'm supposed to work on my thesis).
