Subject: Re: vm kills processes in our 2.3.12 port of reiserfs - what was the  story  on the changes to mark_buffer_dirty() and the too many  dirtybuffers  issue?

Reiserfs data is block aligned for all but the last 4050 bytes of a file (the
tail).  Directories are also not block aligned.  The tail is the whole file for
small files.  I don't understand why you guys think that reiserfs is somehow
harder to integrate with the page cache (except for tails, which really isn't
that hard, especially compared with how hard it is to deal with ext2's 1k blocks
on a 4k page).
I think it is more than a little unfair to let the ext2 folks rewrite VFS and
ext2 in parallel, and then announce an impending code freeze right after
VFS has been radically changed.  End of whine.  With time, and a few confused
postings to linux-kernel, we will catch up to these changes,
and learn how to avoid ext2 style read-ahead, how to insert our multiple-file
read-ahead, how to add SGI style allocate blocks on flush, etc.  Until then we
can have a 2.3 port that works, and that real users will want to use.
So, as I understand it, we should create a check_then_ mark_buffer_dirty(), put
the checking to see if there are too many dirty buffers in there, and stick it
everywhere we have mark_buffer_dirty() in 2.2.11.  Everywhere we have our 2.2.11
custom coded schedule-free mark buffer dirty, we put mark_buffer_dirty(), and
pray it doesn't get changed yet again:-).
We have hired an SMP specialist, and he is going to dump all our schedule
tracking
crud that currently causes us to have our own version of getblk, etc., but it
will take him time to do that, as he is new.
Now we can fix the dbench bug in a manner consistent with the rest of the
kernel, I am happy.

See above.

Yes, and you also save on space, and get sundry other advantages.
You lose nothing.   All remaining flaws in reiserfs performance
are due to peripheral code now being ripped out one section at a time.
Example: next month we get a new file write with extents, allocate blocks on
flush,
and higher performance hole creation.  Even with the flaws that remain,
performance
is on the whole better than other approaches (see MySQL benchmarks and dbench
benchmarks).
