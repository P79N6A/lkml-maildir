The preliminary indications I have indicate there are problems.
I applied the 2.4.23-G4 patch from Ingo with the same results you had,
ie the the mmremap offset and Makefile failures.  Compiled and
rebooted the kernel on a test machine.
XFree86 4.3.0 with the RedHat patches now fails to start with a SIG11
error.  Turning off exec-shield (echoing 0 to
/proc/sys/kernel/exec-shield) enables XFree to start normally.
So it would seem that something changed with the mremap changes in
2.4.24.
