I haven't noticed it being harder or less Unixy.

Like Linux hasn't changed driver interfaces before, causing changes
to drivers that wouldn't be otherwise affected.
Besides, the changes for most drivers seem to be mostly the addition
of a parameter to the registration call. And it puts the knowledge
for creating devinces in the one place that knows it -- the driver.

So, just because you don't see any benefit for you, it is a bad idea
for everybody? Then don't configure it in on your machines.

A static /dev doesn't scale. That's why IRIX 6.4+ uses a hybrid
dynamic /dev. I presume that Sun does it for similar reasons.
The size of /dev isn't really disk space, it is congnitive space. 
And you are right: the size of /dev on a desktop or small server is
not hard to deal with. With devfs it is easier. Some of the things
that the current devfs patch change could (and IMHO should be)
changed even without devfs (the sd{a,b,c,d,...} brain-damage comes
to mind).

And given my experience, including devfs in the standard kernel src
is a no-brainer. Sure, it's a little rough around the edges, but it
won't get better until it is a standard part of the kernel source.
