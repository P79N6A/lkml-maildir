Subject: 2.6.19-rc5-mm2: warnings in MODPOST and later
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Since people were recently complaining about too many warnings:
Here is a list of the warnings I'm getting in MODPOST and later.
Since the warnings by far exceed the 100kB limit of linux-kernel (sic), 
I had to attach them compressed.
With the exception of the "drivers/ide/pci/atiixp:FFFF05", none of these 
warnings is present in Linus' tree.

        of the darkness. There had been need of rain for many days.
       "Only a promise," Lao Er said.
