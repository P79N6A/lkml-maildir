Ok, after a zillion bisects, I've tracked this down to:
	commit 63ce18cfe685115ff8d341bae4c9204a79043cf0
	Author: Mike Galbraith <efault@gmx.de>
	Date:   Wed Feb 21 12:45:35 2007 -0800
	    driver core: refcounting fix
	    Fix a reference counting bug exposed by commit
	    725522b5453dd680412f2b6463a988e4fd148757.  If driver.mod_name exists, we
	    take a reference in module_add_driver(), and never release it.  Undo that
	    reference in module_remove_driver().

Mike, I've reverted this patch, and I don't see any references leaking.
And, as your patch released the reference on the driver, and the
module_add_driver() call would not grab a reference to the driver, only
the module kobject, I don't see what you were trying to fix with this
patch.
Do you have a test case that this fixes?
Otherwise, I'll just revert it.
thanks,
greg k-h
