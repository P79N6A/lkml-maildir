   But if this were truly the issue, the allocation and deallocation
   overhead for pagetables should show up as additional pressure
   against zone->lock.
The big gain is not only that allocation/free is cheap, also
page table entries tend to hit in cpu cache for even freshly
allocated page tables.
I think that is the bit that would show up in the mmap lmbench
test.
