Yi,
   First of all networking related questions should go to 
linux-net@vger.kernel.org. Now for ur question.
cwnd has got significance in the sending side of a TCP connection. Its the 
sender that keeps changing the cwnd based on the ACKs recvd. If you are 
using wget for downloading a file and you are expecting cwnd to change on 
the wget side, then the answer is that since wget is *only* receiving 
data, cwnd will not change on wget side. It will change on the other side.
If you are checking for cwnd on the other side then please ignore my 
answer.
Thanx
tomar
