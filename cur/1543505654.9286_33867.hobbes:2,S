Hello all,
I am having RH6.0 system. The X windows system is working fine for the root login but dosent work for user login. I have done all the necessary setting in the .xinitrc. THe error it gives when I do startx is:
_X11TranSocketUNIXConnect:Can't connect:errorno=111...
.mach64ProgramC1kMach64CT:Warning Q<10.6666667
giving up
xinit:connection refused(errno 111)
unable to connect to x server
xinit:No such process(errno 3) server error
and it fails
What can be the possible cause of problem?
Thanking You in advance,
ALpesh
