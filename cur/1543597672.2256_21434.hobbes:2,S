Hi List,
Can somebody guide me on how to install RedHat Linux (e.g. 7.1)
to a scsi disk which is connected to a scsi controller for which the 
driver is not present on the installation media ? 
I want the installation prodecure to ask for driver diskette
and when I insert the driver diskette, it will load the driver
for the controller from the floppy-disk and find out what all 
devices are connected to it and then probably start installation 
on one of them.
Regards,
-hiren
