I've seen this before, long ago.  I fixed the problem by specifying an
mtu of 1500.  What happened was that my ISP specified <mru 1524> in
the initial negotiation, indicating that I could set my mtu to that;
pppd did so, but the 1524 size packets were being dropped by a router
somewhere (at least that's what I surmised, and had some minimal
evidence to back that up).
Your mtu appears to be at 1500 already; try setting it to 576 (I think
this is the magic "always works" number) and see if that fixes the
problem.
