The interaction of cpusets and hotplug should be in good shape.  Look
in kernel/cpuset.c for CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU and CONFIG_MEMORY_HOTPLUG,
and you will see the two routines to call for cpu and memory hotplug
events, cpuset_handle_cpuhp() and cpuset_track_online_nodes().
The problem area is the interaction of dynamic sched domains and
cpusets with hot plug events.
