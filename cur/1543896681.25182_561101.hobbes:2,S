Hi Roman,
Several instabilities on Kconfig started to happen after replacing
Kconfig menus to use menuconfig, as this one, reported by Oliver:

In this specific case, all V4L USB drivers depends on V4L_USB_DRIVERS,
that depends, in turn, on USB. So, if USB is not selected,
V4L_USB_DRIVERS should be unselected, unselecting zc0301.
Unfortunately, the Kernel building system is not properly handling it.
This is the (snipped) media/video/Kconfig:
menuconfig V4L_USB_DRIVERS
        bool "V4L USB devices"
        depends on USB
        default y
if V4L_USB_DRIVERS
source "drivers/media/video/pvrusb2/Kconfig"
<snip/>
source "drivers/media/video/zc0301/Kconfig"
<snip/>
endif # V4L_USB_DRIVERS

Cheers,
Mauro
