Just pasting my comments to kyle on IRC for benefit of discussion:
"I'm of the opinion that cmdline args from the kernel should override
modprobe args...mainly because adding those args to the kernel cmdline
is clearly an attempt to override userspace"
"maybe have some sysfs attr to disable this feature, so userspace can go
back to normal after whatever needed fixing"
The use case for us is that we've had to add a couple of initramfs
scripts to parse common module params (all_generic_ide for example).
We'd like to move away from this and have a clear way of passing any
module param on the kernel command line. Workarounds for users are much
easier than having to roll new CDs for every little quirk. Plus it's
easier for testing (if the quirk is a bug that keeps them from
installing at all, then we can't just hand them new kernels very
easily).
