   It turned out that changing ./linux/serial.h of the setserial utility solved
   that problem:
   struct serial_struct {
	   int     type;
	   int     line;
	   unsigned long   port;
	   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Oops.  I ended up making a binary incompatible change for those
platforms where long != int.  Sh*t.  What platforms is this true for,
other than Alpha?   The change was made to try to make things better for
at least some 64-bit platforms, but I it looks like it's going to end up
causing problems for others.  Sorry about that.   Can folks who worry
about 64-bit platforms let me know how they would best like to handle
this?  I may need to do some ugly platform-specific #ifdef's to handle
this......
