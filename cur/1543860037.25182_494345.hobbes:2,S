For a statically linked busybox it makes sense, but you're right that a 
dynamically linked one is going to suck however you do it...
I guess what I really want to do is promote a vfork() to a real fork() after 
the fact.  Which sounds painful.
For the daemonize() case I want to unblock the parent and have it exit.  Too 
bad I can't call clone() with some kind of CLONE_VFORK_BACKWARDS so it blocks 
the child until the parent exits.  (Hmmm...  CLONE_STOPPED doesn't help, just 
moves the race...)
For the "new process runs code out of this executable" case what I really want 
is an actual fork, hideously expensive as that is on nommu systems.  (There 
are things I can do to minimize that.)  Maybe I can call clone() directly on 
a nommu system to get it to fork, even when the C library hasn't got it?  
Hmmm...

The one from argv[0].  (Notice how exec has a "path to executable" and then an 
argv array?  Nobody said that the path to executable and argv[0] had to point 
to the same string...)
