this actually looks unclean to me. I thought the code duplication in
ext2 and ext3 was the price that you have to pay to avoid any layering
violation. I personally would like to see the upstream patch go into
-stable. However we don't have this upstream at the moment. So what
would you consider sending to Linus?
