Only places that may deal with bigmem pages and the core of the kernel
must be checked. I don't exclude there still something to fix (as happened
with kernel/ptrace.c and /proc/*/mem) but with the current design we
shouldn't need to touch the device drivers at all.
The only real problem currently seems to be raw-io to me... (hints?)
