Mark , does the box you test on have any extra PCI/e/X cards ( like a extra graphics card , extra network card ) ?
On my box all extra PCI/e/X slots are empty I just use the onboard stuff at the moment.
Also when you boot do you have any USB stick , keyboard , etc device plugged in in that box ?

If it helps I can send you my config over. 
In any way I'll try to build a kernel with all USB modular when I'm back home.
