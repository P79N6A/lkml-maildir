I've been experiencing a problem with the matroxfb, in a mutliheaded environment(2 four 
meg 
Matrox Mill. II's).
for a while now on the text consoles after switching back and forth I would get 
something like
ll_rw_block: device 08:02: only 512-char blocks implemented (4096)
some where between 6 and a dozon times in a row, then back to normal
however just recenly on the primary card while running XFree86 with FBDev version 
3.3.5(red 
hat rpm's) i experienced that exact message, about 2 screens worth, then dumped me to 
the 
console, i could move around and stuff, but when I tried to log out the console freaked out, 
I 
got the message about 10 more times then nothing, I could type but it wouldn't do anything, 
I 
could also switch to other consoles using alt-F(whatever) but when I tried shutdown -r now it 
sent the broadcast message out then dumped me to the console(never started a shutdown)
any help here? I'll be glad to be a test subject, I can multi boot this box, and a few other 
boxes 
to access stuff from so no problems.
