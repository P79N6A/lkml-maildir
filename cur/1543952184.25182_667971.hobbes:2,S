So that avoids the VFS layer issues, but it's still strictly much worse 
than just having a run-time loading.
What's the problem with just loading a new DSDT later? Potentially as in 
*much* later: including when user-space is all up-and-running? 
For things like DVD install images, you'd quite possibly want to have a 
few known-workaround DSDT images with the installer, and just say "ok, we 
want to fix up this ACPI crap in order to get working suspend/resume" kind 
of thing.
So what's the reason for pushing for this insanely-early workaround in the 
first place, instead of letting user-space do something like
	cat my-dsdt-image > /proc/sys/acpi/DSDT
or whatever at runtime?
