Using a USB-storage device, I removed the device while there is
no mounted FS on it (and to my knowledge there should not
be any dirty blocks). Yet, I observed IO error reports on shutdown.
Anything trying to access block devices on shutdown? Why?
This was observed on several 2.4.19-ac1 and 2.4.20-pre5-ac2.
Thanks,
Itai
