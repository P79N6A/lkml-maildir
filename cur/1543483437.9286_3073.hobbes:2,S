why do i have piss about with hacky network setup scripts, when
before i could "ifconfig" "route" and have things the way i want
them?
anyway, this feature is inconvenient in some situations, eg:
* unusual setups,
* network software and scripts that havn't been updated yet.
The old way, is never inconvenient!
ergo: the old way of ifconfig+route is better!
