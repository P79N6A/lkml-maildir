Wildly; compare test11-pre1 and testll-pre2 sizes:
-rwxr-xr-x    1 root     root      1789457 Nov  7 20:26
vmlinux-t11p01 
-rwxr-xr-x    1 root     root      2625016 Nov 10 10:15
vmlinux-t11p02

Running:

looking at the output, the large positive changes seem to be
(doing it by eye, might have skipped and/or missed something):
Symbol	Old	size	New	size	Delta	Change	(%)
