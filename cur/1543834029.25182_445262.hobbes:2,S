    Hm, from my experience it usually falls back to UltraDMA/44 and then the 
thing startrt working...

    This happens because the "old" driver misses the PLL calibration code.
    You may want to try these Albert's patches:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?t=110992452800002&r=1&w=2
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?t=110992471500002&r=1&w=2

http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?t=111019238400003&r=1&w=2
    It looks like they were never considered for accepting into the kernel
while they succesfully solve this issue. Maybe Albert could try pushing them 
into -mm tree once more?
WBR, Sergei
