I have a dead process in my task list, which has been inherited
by init.
  PID  PPID USER     PRI  NI  SIZE  RSS SHARE STAT  LIB %CPU %MEM TIME COMMA
10699     1 root       0   0  1224    4     0 DW      0  0.0  0.0 0:00 kscd
I've been getting CDROM ioctl error messages all day, as I've
posted allready.  klogd has just died not long ago, and now I see
kscd dead.  Console error messages are being printed on my
screen.
I've just installed GNOME 1.0, and am running KDE 1.1 and kernel
2.0.36.
Any ideas?

and I don't think I'm ever going back to QWERTY!
