Subject: [PATCH 15/36] KVM: make kvm_unregister_irq_ack_notifier() safe
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/12/14/23

From: Mark McLoughlin <markmc@redhat.com>
We never pass a NULL notifier pointer here, but we may well
pass a notifier struct which hasn't previously been
registered.
Guard against this by using hlist_del_init() which will
not do anything if the node hasn't been added to the list
and, when removing the node, will ensure that a subsequent
call to hlist_del_init() will be fine too.
Fixes an oops seen when an assigned device is freed before
and IRQ is assigned to it.
