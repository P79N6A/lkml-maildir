It's my pleasure to contact you for a business  venture 
which I , intend to establish in your country. 
Though I have not met 
with you  before but I believe,one has to risk confiding in someone to 
succeed  sometimes in life. There is this huge amount of Twleve million 
USA  dollars ($12,000,000.00) which my late Client  in a  security 
storage  house here  before he was poisoned by unknow persons.Now I 
decided to  invest these money in your country or anywhere safe  enough 
outside the  country for security and political reasons.We want  you to 
help us to  transfer this fund to your country for investment  purposes 
on the  followings below:  If you can be of an  assistance to us I will 
be  pleased to offer you 20% Of the total fund. 
It is very 
important  that you forward to me your full name ,your private  
telephone and fax 
numbers/occupation,to enable me send all relevant  
documents pertaining   the deposit of this fund to you. 
Hence I will 
not be exposed to avoid loosing the money. 
I await for your soonest 
response. 
Thank you and God bless you. 
Sincerely, 
CHARLES  
BROWN.
