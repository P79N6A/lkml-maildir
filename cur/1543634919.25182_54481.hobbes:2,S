Why not treat a module just like any other structure?  Obtain a 
reference to it _before_ using it.  I propose this change:
- When a module is inserted, it has a reference count of 1.  This keeps 
it loaded.
- get_module() obtains a reference to a module.  It cannot fail.
- put_module() releases a reference to a module.  If it goes to zero, 
the exit callback is called and then module is safely freeable.
- sys_delete_module calls the deregister callback.  When this function 
returns, it is gauranteed that the reference count will not increase 
again.  It then does a put_module().
pseudo code here:
void get_module(struct module *mod)
{
	atomic_inc(&mod->uc.usecount);
}
void put_module(struct module *mod)
{
	if (atomic_dec_and_lock(&mod->uc.usecount, &unload_lock)) {
		if (mod->exit)
			mod->exit();
		free_module(mod);
		spin_unlock(&unload_lock);
	}
}
sys_delete_module()
{
	mod->deregister();
	put_module(mod);
}
