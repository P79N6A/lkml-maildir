Most newer systems (e.g. newer Intel chipsets) should have a global APIC,
but it is usually not enabled because the BIOS doesn't supply the necessary
MP tables. I guess it could be turned on somehow, but it would be probably
very board specific.
You could also just put a button onto the NMI pin in a unused ISA slot
and trigger NMI manually or use one of the supported watchdog cards 
which do it with an timer.
