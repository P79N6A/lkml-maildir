Then it comes out to close enough? I'm probably just not getting the
problem. Could you further explain?

Exactly two, yes. However 1.5 wouldn't quite do it, as jiffies would be
incremented once and delay_at_last_interrupt should be set to .5*HZ,
thus loosing no time.

Yea, I had some printk code in there, but I have a card here that can
cause 30ms SMI stalls once per sec, so it was getting a bit verbose.
Although printing out for the first five, would be fine. I'll add that
right away. Thanks!
