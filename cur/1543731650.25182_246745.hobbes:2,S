Yes, I dislike it, but I've learned to live with downloading...
The Megaraid patch set, by the way, annoys me even more by not actually
applying to the kernel tree.  it doesn't reflect the fact that the
Changelog.megaraid is under Documentation/scsi not drivers/scsi.
However, it's all merged into the vanilla kernel now but in future, if
you could follow Andrew's guide, I'd be very grateful.
