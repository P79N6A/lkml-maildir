Dear list,
After meeting a faint-hearted Linux kernel lately I decided to try myself
at persuading it to not be afraid of NFLOG. This chat gave a series of
ten commandments I present today. Take a look and agree or comment.
Here's the list:
  1. nfulnl_log_packet() - don't count the same thing twice
* 2. nfulnl_log_packet() - don't leak references
  3. nfulnl_log_packet() - don't copy-and-paste code
* 4. nfulnl_timer() - don't touch freed memory
  5. nfulnl_recv_config() - don't free what isn't there
  6. nfulnl_recv_config() - don't touch dead animals
* 7. instance_destroy() - remember of your appointments
  8. instance_create() - don't lock the bookshelf for too long
! 9. __build_packet_message() - don't forget your tail
 10. instance_create() - wear your watch when going out
Ninth is THE one. Those marked with stars are important I believe.
Others came out on the way. I'll send them one-in-a-mail right after
this message. I'm CC:ing this to LKML, so someone could put the important
ones in -stable maybe?
Have a nice reading,
Michal Miroslaw
