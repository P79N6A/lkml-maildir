This is a file system dependent issue and it should be up to each file
system how they implement this.  The ~ ideas had some merit, but the
FS's still need to know when attributes are being read and written to
map well to those FS's that can support this (and EXT2 could be one of
them).  The best general purpose way I can think of through the VFS (not
to say there are not other approaches) is to implement an indirection
structure within the functions that manage inodes, i.e. read_inode,
write_inode, etc.  
add a structure pointer to a table of function that support named
attributes, such as
attr_opns:   <filesystem>_attr_opns  
which just indirects to another table with semantics a lot like:
attr_open:       int attr_open(struct inode *f_inode, struct dentry
*f_dentry, 
     			       struct inode **result, int flags, int mode);  
				// return inode for attr file in *result
attr_close:      int attr_close(struct inode *attr);
attr_unlink:     int attr_unlink(struct inode *dir, struct dentry
*dentry);
attr_create:      //   the rest are standard linux file opns calls
attr_read:
attr_write:
attr_fsync:
attr_truncate:
attr_permission:
The real question here is do we want to waste an inode on one these
attribute chains, but may have to since named external attributes do
have a filesize.   There's also a question of permissions.  One thing
Linux could do to improve on the NTFS attriute model is to add fine
grained security to individual file attributes.
IMHO
