Coming from Amiga I'd suggest:
     5. Once you panic, write the output (+ some magic and/or
        checksum) into some fixed memory region and let the
        kernel recover it upon next bootup.
Of course this requires some memory that is _not_ cleared at boot 
time -- I don't know whether that is available on all architectures.
But it would be convenient to have something like /proc/sys/last_panic.
Regards, Colin
