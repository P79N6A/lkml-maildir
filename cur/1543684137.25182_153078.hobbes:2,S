Ok, that's what I figured.

Well, I suspect its just the first. If you're not generating interrupts
then I'm doubtful the IDE driver is at fault (although I'd believe it if
you were losing time under load). Also the PIT based time source is
pretty simple and hasn't functionally changed much (well, it has been
moved around a bit). 
It may be the timer interrupt has grown in cost since the argument to
change HZ to 1000 was made. Although using the PIT there isn't much we
do from a time of day perspective. If I can find a second, I'll see if I
can compare interrupt overhead between 2.4 and 2.5. But I'd imagine the
box would barely be usable if we're wasting all our time handling timer
interrupts (is it usable??).
