OK, time for my pet peeve: linux/cdrom.h.
#include <asm/byteorder.h>
[...]
/* for CDROM_PACKET_COMMAND ioctl */
struct cdrom_generic_command
{
[...]
        struct request_sense    __user *sense;
[...]
}
struct request_sense {
#if defined(__BIG_ENDIAN_BITFIELD)
        __u8 valid              : 1;
        __u8 error_code         : 7;
#elif defined(__LITTLE_ENDIAN_BITFIELD)
        __u8 error_code         : 7;
        __u8 valid              : 1;
#endif
        __u8 segment_number;
[...]
}
At least one architecture's asm/byteorder.h has been C++-incompatible
in the past (I forget what; it was 2 years ago that I cared about it).
So to fix this, we need a asm-*/user/byteorder.h that only describes
the endianness.  Except ... what about mips/mipsel?

conscience-soothing falsities, and will diligently study them, and refuse
to examine any refutations of them; and thus he will by and by convince 
himself that the war is just, and will thank God for the better sleep 
he enjoys after this process of grotesque self-deception." -- Mark Twain
