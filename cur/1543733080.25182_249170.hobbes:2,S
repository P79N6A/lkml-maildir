Is this a multipath configuration where pci0000:01 and pci0000:02 can
both get to the same target bus? So both busses are top level busses?
I'm trying to figure out where to stick the vga=0/1 attribute for
disabling all the VGA devices in a domain. It's starting to look like
there isn't a single node in sysfs that corresponds to a domain, in
this case there are two for the same domain.
