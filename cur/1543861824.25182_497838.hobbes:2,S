Well, in the past I think new drivers have been added after the merge
window, given that there's no chance of regressions (old kernel == no
support for device X, so even if the new driver is buggy it's no worse
than the old kernel).  (eg a quick git scan shows commit 0f64478c
added a USB driver between 2.6.19-rc2 and 2.6.19-rc3, and I'm sure you
can find lots of other examples)
Anyway, you answered my question.  I wasn't pushing to include the
driver now, I just wanted to know what you were planning to do.
Thanks.
