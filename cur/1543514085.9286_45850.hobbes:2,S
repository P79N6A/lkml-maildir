   An idle time of more than 27 bit times (3 chars) on the wire
   signifies the end of an incoming packet, so the callback (a) would be
   necessary even when there's nothing waiting to transmit. It also
   needs to give the current length of the input buffer, or stick a
   marker in the buffer somehow - at the same time as I receive this
   callback, I know that some machine somewhere else on the RS485 bus
   will immediately start transmitting, before I have a chance to clear
   the input buffer.
There's no end of packet character?  How.... awful.
