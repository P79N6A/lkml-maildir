I've been playing with creating a filesystem in a file, mounting it with the
loopback device, copying files to it, and then unmounting it.  In the process
of doing this, the directory acting as the mount point has become corrupted:
% ls -l /mnt
br-xr-S-wx   0 root     root       0,   0 Jan  1  1970 /mnt
The loopback filesystem was an ext2 filesystem in a file consisting mostly of
holes (until I filled it up).
I haven't yet been able to recreate the situation.
In trying to use /dev/loop0 again, I received the error:
	ioctl: LOOP_SET_FD: Device or resource busy
The 'df' and 'mount' commands insist that /mnt isn't mounted, though
/proc/mounts
lists it as being mounted.  It seems that there was some confusion on
unmounting
it.
