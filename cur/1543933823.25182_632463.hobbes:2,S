depmod has a bunch of issues that need taking care of, this is just one
of them, but yeah, for now it should just ignore these additional sects.
I'd rewrite the thing but I need some more time to do that in the new
year (and there's lots of special casing for cross-building for
32/64/little/big endian that would need a lot of testing).
I'll push a new release over the weekend.
Jon.
