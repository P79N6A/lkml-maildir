Note that our default spinlocks _depend_ on a bog-standard store just 
working as an unlock, so this wouldn't even be anything half-way new:
	static inline void __raw_spin_unlock(raw_spinlock_t *lock)
	{
		asm volatile("movb $1,%0" : "+m" (lock->slock) :: "memory");
	}
There are some Opteron errata (and a really old P6 bug) wrt this, but they 
are definitely CPU bugs, and we haven't really worked out what the Opteron 
solution should be (the bug is apparently pretty close to impossible to 
trigger in practice, so it's not been a high priority).

We probably could. It should be easy enough to mark "struct address_space" 
to be 8-byte aligned.

You're right, it could be really painful. We'd have to rename the field, 
and use some inline function to access it (which masks off the low bits).
