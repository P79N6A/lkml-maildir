gcc 3.4 seems to be the first gcc version that could actually handle 
such cases.
But since the kernel uses -fno-unit-at-a-time, it doesn't work.
The problem with unit-at-a-time is that it might increase the stack 
usage. Arjan explained this in the "GCC 3.4 and broken inlining." thread 
that started Thursday.
