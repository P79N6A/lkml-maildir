Each directory dentry contains hash of items and pointer to inode. Each
directory has it's d_parent.

That is problem. If you create file in foo/, there could still be cached
"not found" response in foo/baz/qux/. When you delete the file in one
directory, it still exists in another. You can make directory hardlinks
with ext2ed and see what happens. Maybe you could solve it so that you go
through all aliases and invalidate cache entries when you change
something.
There is another problem: moving directory to itself. The dentry cache
contains test that prevents you from doing it, however if you disable the
test, you will create loop of dentries, each poining with d_parent to
other. An when something like d_path is called on it, it locks up.
Additionally, this dentry loop can't be freed; you would have to implement
garbage collection for dentry cache.

It's not impossible, but you'll have to change a lot of things in VFS. It's
not just "write filesystem driver".

No. dentries are passed to almost all VFS calls, you can't avoid them.
