Well, hdc=ide-scsi is for 2.2 and hdc=scsi is for 2.4. Yup, yet another of 
those gratuitious incompatibilities.

I'm not sure why this is happening for you, my CDR drive works for both 
reading and writing using the ide-scsi driver. But it's a known fact that 
ide-scsi is not perfect, so that could explain it.

So now you're saying it *does* work with ide-scsi? I'm utterly confused...

Nope. Ide-scsi should be fine for both reading and writing.
