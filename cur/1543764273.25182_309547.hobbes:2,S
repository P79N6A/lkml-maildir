Greg dropped it for some reason.  I think that's best because it needed a
significant amount of rework.  I'd like to see it resubitted in totality so
we can take another look at it.
It's a new piece of core kernel infrastructure and the barriers for that
are necessarily high.

I could put the fork connector into -mm, but would like to be convinced
that it's acceptable to and useful for all system accounting requirements,
not just the one project.  That means code, please.
