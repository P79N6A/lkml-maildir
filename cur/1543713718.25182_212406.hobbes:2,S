It does two different things because it's trying to run from keventd.
In the case that current is not keventd, it schedules the work, so
keventd will pick that work up later to run in it's process context.
How early is this hang?  It looks like init thread adds work and waits
for it's completion while holding a semaphore.  It is never woken up by
keventd which is sleeping waiting for wakeup from semaphore that init
thread took.
Seems troubling to hold the sem while calling call_usermodehelper, as that
could go off for a long time.
