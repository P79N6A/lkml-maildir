You have to touch all the wait queues in case you want to sleep. So it becomes
16384 iterations of sock->ops->poll() doing a wait queue add and then
16384 tear downs.
There has been experimental work doing caching of tables to avoid some overhead
but for large scaling signal based I/O with rt signal returns is going to
scale better as you pay one setup per handle not one setup per handle per
event.
