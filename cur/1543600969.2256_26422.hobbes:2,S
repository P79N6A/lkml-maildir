The patch I submitted to Andrea had logic to make sure that
two CPUs don't execute wait_for_rcu() at the same time.
Somehow it seems to have got lost in Andrea's modifications.
I will look at that and submit a new patch to Andrea, if necessary.
As for wrappers, I am agnostic. However, I think sooner or later
people will start asking for them, if we go by our past experience.
Thanks
