I tried various approaches to reduce the overhead that power of two slab 
sizes cause in SLUB during the initial comparison of memory use with SLOB. 
This involved creating slabs in 32 byte increments and trying to add a few 
additional extra slabs in between the power of two sizes. None of that led 
to convincing results.
I found that the SLAB scheme with power of two caches and two extra ones 
(96 and 192 bytes) was optimal.
