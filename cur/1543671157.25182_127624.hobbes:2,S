Well.. sure.. it's easy enough to write something that supports plugging in
a terabyte.  The *tricky* part is supporting it well - you have page table
issues, you have swapping/thrashing issues (if you *do* have to page something
out, you're in trouble.. ;), you have process scheduling issues (how many
Apache processes does it take to use up a terabyte?  What's your load average
at that point?), you have multi-processor scaling issues (you're gonna want
to have 64+ processors, etc..)
Consider - the number of machines with over a terabyte of RAM is limited:

That's the sort of box that has a terabyte.  Do you *really* think that
M$ 2003 has all the stuff needed to scale to THAT size?
