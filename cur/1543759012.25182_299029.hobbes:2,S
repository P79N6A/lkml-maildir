There is not much the ALSA developers can do about this, because we just
do not have access to the 1000s of hardware varieties out there,  and
vendors are inexplicably loath to give out any docs on something as
simple as a cheap shitty laptop AC97 codec.
The usual pattern that leads to a regression like the Thinkpad issue is
that a user reports a bug, a fix is merged, the user reports the problem
is fixed on $FOO hardware, then a week later we are deluged with reports
that $BAR hardware is now broken.
Catching a problem like this before it gets out the door would require
access to 1000s of laptops, unlimited time, and reasonable hardware
documentation.  Chances are we would still miss something.  IOW it's
impossible.
The *only* solution for these kinds of driver regressions is to get more
people to test the release candidates.  "Being more careful" will not
help, because we just don't have access to all of the hardware.
