From kbuild 2.5 top level Makefile.
# FIXME: Current kernel source includes linux/version.h, mainly to get
# KERNEL_VERSION().  version.h also includes UTS_RELEASE which changes every
# time the kernel identifiers change.  The presence of UTS_RELEASE in version.h
# causes lots of unnecessary recompilations, very few places actually want
# UTS_RELEASE.  The new makefile generates separate linux/version.h and
# linux/uts_release.h, with version.h including utsname.h to avoid compilation
# errors.  Find all the source code that needs just UTS_RELEASE and change it to
# include uts_release.h, then remove #include <linux/uts_release.h> from the
# commands below.  KAO
Unfortunately this area of kbuild 2.4 is fragile.  At the moment,
changes to the top level Makefile indirectly force a rebuild,
Makefile -> version.h -> KERNEL_VERSION() -> almost everything.
Breaking that chain _might_ cause problems in 2.4 because it does not
have a complete dependency chain to pick up changes to the top level
Makefile, it only works at the moment due to the extra recompiles.  I
am not willing to change this in 2.4 until I have got it stable in 2.5.
