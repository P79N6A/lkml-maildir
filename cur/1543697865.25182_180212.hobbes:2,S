The user sets the SO_TIMESTAMP setsockopt to 1 and then you get the cmsg.
That's per socket state. The other way is to use the SIOCGTSTAMP ioctl.
That is a bit more ugly because it has no state, but you can do 
a heuristic and assume that an process that does SIOCGTSTAMP once
will do it in future too and set a flag in this case. 
The first SIOCGTSTAMP would be inaccurate, but the following (after 
all untimestamped packets have been flushed) would be ok.
Doing for IP would be relatively easy, the only major user of the
timestamp seems to be DECnet and the bridge, but I supose those could be 
converted to use jiffies too.
