you just grab a DRI snapshot which contains new userspace and DRM, and
install it... it builds the DRM against your current kernel, now if your
current kernel has a DRM module built-in which is a different version, you
are screwed, snapshot process breaks..
It's one of the major successes I feel of the DRI project, those
snapshots allowed people with Radeon IGP chipsets to get 3d acceleration
long before now (they still can't get it any current distro), same goes
for i915 as Keith points out..
Dave.
