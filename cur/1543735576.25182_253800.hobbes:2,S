I suppose this reply is a bit late, but...
I'd be happy to hear of alternative methods of dealing with hugetlbfs'
operational constraints. The unusability of the core VM function
truncate_inode_pages() on hugetlb pagecache was IIRC be the primary
reason for it, but there also appears to be some inode management going
on there now that it's been disturbed by someone else.
