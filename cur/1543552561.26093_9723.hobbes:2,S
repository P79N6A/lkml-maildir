In serial.c, it appears that unless do_autoconfig() is called through an
ioctl() call, the variable state->type, which is used to index into the
uart_config[] array, is not set, resulting in problems (I'm working with
a mips embedded board).  Why not set info->type from sstate->type in
get_async_struct(), where the rest of the async_struct parameters are
set?
