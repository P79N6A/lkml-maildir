No; this is a "I'm doing something magic and need to know before someone
else takes the CPU".  Almost by definition, you cannot have two of them
at the same time.  Let someone else try that if and when...
But having different hooks for different tasks makes a great deal of
sense.  This hook makes a great deal of sense.
But KVM-specific code in the scheduler is just wrong, and I think we all
know that.
Cheers,
Rusty.
