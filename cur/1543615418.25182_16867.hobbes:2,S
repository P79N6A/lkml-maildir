Uh, no. Almost all 486 PCI boards and early Pentium/K5/K6 boards have
the PCI bus hanging of the VLB or other local bus, and on those ISA
isn't behind an ISA bridge. These chipsets do have ISA but no ISA
bridge.
To name one example: VIA Apollo Master, vt82c570 chipset has only Host
Bridge and IDE Controller visible on the PCI bus.
