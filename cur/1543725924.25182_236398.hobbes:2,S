An uncontrolled namespace is no better than the existing printk info,
IMO. And I think it's next to impossible to control the kevent
namespace if it's scattered across the tree as strings, having tried
to do something analogous for another large project.

An API that looks like sysfs + dnotify to userspace is almost what you
want. While the sysfs namespace has some of the problems above, we're
already stuck with it.

Per mountpoint sysfs trees? I'm sure there are lifetime issues there.
Btw, we probably already have potential issues with kevents being
stale by the time userspace picks them up - eth0 up, eth0 down, eth1
renamed eth0, userspace notices eth0 up, tries to config downed eth1.
