Sounds somewhat familiar. The pump that came with RedHat 6.2 never worked
correctly at work, but dhcpcd worked just fine (we don't have static IP
addresses, but there are fewer machines than there are addresses in the pool,
so effectively, we do :-). The odd thing is that I (mis?)understood in this
case that dhcpcd was not working either (unless I'm confusing this with a
different thread). Suffice to say that newer versions of pump seem to work
much better, at least for me.
