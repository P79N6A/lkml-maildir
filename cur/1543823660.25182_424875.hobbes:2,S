It may not be clear, but by "pool", I mean some group of individually
activated hooks, doing little but calling some routine of
instrumentation with a few parameters.  Special-interest data like
timing, latency would be computed in the instrumentation code, not
necessarily at the hook site, so that part need incur no waste for
disinterested users.
Not-activated (dormant) hooks would indeed cost a little.  The
question is how much time/space cost is acceptable, in order to reap
the benefits of widely available probing.
