Actually it just makes it marginally more probable.
Normal open without O_CREATE runs ->d_revalidate outside of i_sem i.e. neither 
devfs_lookup vs. devfs_d_revalidate_wait nor devfs_d_revalidate_wait vs. 
itself are protected  by i_sem and this is (should be) the most common case 
for /dev access.
This race happens under non-trivial conditions. devfsd descendant (i.e. some 
action) should be involved; and action triggered by devfs_lookup does not 
race with it by definition because devfs_lookup waits for action to finish. 
I.e. it needs another devfsd action that would access /dev entry after it 
just has been created or two concurrent lookups in LOOKUP action itself. 
Quite unlikely in real life and race window is very small.
I do not want to sound like it has to be ignored - but devfs code is so messy 
that no trivial fix exists that would not make code even more messy. So I 
would still apply original fixes and let this problem be solved later - it is 
not so important as to delay two other.
