Dave-
If you do:
grep TUNER_MULTI_I2C < patch-2.6.12-git9
you will get:
+config CONFIG_TUNER_MULTI_I2C
+#define CONFIG_TUNER_MULTI_I2C /**/
+#ifdef CONFIG_TUNER_MULTI_I2C
+#ifdef CONFIG_TUNER_MULTI_I2C
+#ifdef CONFIG_TUNER_MULTI_I2C
+#ifndef CONFIG_TUNER_MULTI_I2C
+#ifdef CONFIG_TUNER_MULTI_I2C
... So in fact, after applying your patch above,  NOW it is a silly 
config option, which in effect, removed all functionality of 
CONFIG_TUNER_MULTI_I2C alltogether.  It so happens that this has been 
completely removed in the current -mm, and I've confirmed with Mauro 
Chehab (video4linux maintainer) that nothing will be broken after 
applying your patch, so there is nothing to worry about.  After the 
current tuner patches in -mm get merged, this whole thing will be a moot 
point.
