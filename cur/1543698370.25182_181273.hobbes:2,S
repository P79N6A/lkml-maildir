Isn't this what SSCSI (Serial SCSI) will be doing also -- one drive one cable?
I'd imagine that you'd have one connection to the enclosure, and the entire
enclosure will look like a single drive.  I've heard of SCSI enclosures like
this (even ones that hold ide drives, but talk scsi to the host).

There will probably be many ways to get around any issues that may come up
with SATA until SATA-2 comes out.
