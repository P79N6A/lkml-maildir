hm.  Maybe.  I'd worry that the memory at vc->vc_screenbuf isn't of the
correct size and this patch will convert a leak into a buffer overrun.
Also, what's up with this, in vc_resize()?
	if (vc->vc_kmalloced)
		kfree(vc->vc_screenbuf);
	vc->vc_screenbuf = newscreen;
	vc->vc_kmalloced = 1;
if vc->vc_kmalloced means "there is kmalloced memory at vc->vc_screenbuf"
then this is wrong.
This code is all pretty twisty and I fear touching it.
