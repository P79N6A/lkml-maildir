I have a Radeon All-In-Wonder 7500.  I downloaded the tar.gz patch and
applied it to -test7.  The resulting kernel panics at startup, while
test7 with the same config works fine for me.
Before it panics, the penguin shows up at least, so it works a little
bit :-/
I have not had time to attach a serial console to capture the oops yet,
but hope to do that by the end of the day...
