Again, the point of the patch is to get rid of such poking.

On the size, I beg to differ.  One of the reasons the glue module is
so large is because of the fact that GPFS was written to run in an AIX
kernel rather than a Linux kernel.  I would guess that if GPFS had
been instead been derived from Linux, the glue module would be much
smaller.  On the kernel version checks, the point of the patch is
to get rid of at least some of these.

So why are you coming out against something that you seem to believe
allows -better- alignment with Linus's rules?
						Thanx, Paul
