That was just one random example.
Another one would be :
drivers/chat/tty_io.c, __do_SAK() contains
    read_lock(&tasklist_lock);
    task_lock(p);
kernel/sys.c, sys_setrlimit contains
    task_lock(current->group_leader);
    read_lock(&tasklist_lock);
task_lock is a shorthand for spin_lock(&p->alloc_lock). If read_lock is 
a normal spinlock, then this is an A/B B/A deadlock.
