Hi all,
I have been investigating the random invalid instruction occourances on 
sparc32 (sun4c) and identified that the problem was introduced 
pre-v2.6.22-rc1. v2.6.21 is OK. The first time I have observed the issue 
so far is after commit b46b8f19c9cd435ecac4d9d12b39d78c137ecd66:
Increase slab redzone to 64bits.
Prior to this commit there apears to be a problem with the memory 
management (depmod -a causes the system to run out of memory!) that may be 
masking the issue. As a result of this, I am going to try to find the 
'last known good' commit after v2.6.21 to see if this helps narrow down 
the cause.
Regards
 	Mark Fortescue.
