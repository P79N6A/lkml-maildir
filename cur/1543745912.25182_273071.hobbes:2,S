As below - note I have also got a printk in cdrom_timer_expiry () - but 
nothing there.  I have included a couple of commands before the key one, and 
also a few 'lost interrupt' calls after the lock to show how it then doesn't 
recover. (and I made a spelling error in one of the messages the message - 
seld should mean self).
