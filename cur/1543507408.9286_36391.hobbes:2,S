  I just finished a nice class on System Performance Tuning for Solarise. 
Covered some great topics and had some really nice parameters.  Does Linux
have the capability to modify an "/etc/system" style file and such in a 
similar manner or such an easy interface atleast?  I'd like to custom tune
a few of my boxes.
