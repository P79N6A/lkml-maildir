I understand this idea at last.
Section size of DLPAR of PPC is only 16MB.
But kmalloc area of virtual address have to be contigous 
even if the area is divided 16MB physically.
Dave-san's implementation (it was for IA32) was same index between 
phys_section and mem_section. So, I was confused.

But, I suppose this translation might be too complex.
I worry that many person don't like this which is cause of
performance deterioration.
Should this translation be in common code?
Bye.
