I have an Award bios on MSI nforce2 mboard. Their bios flash
file begins with
"w" for Award  w6570nms.760(W6570 v760 bios flash file)
"p" phoenix
"a" ami
also appears at boot but goes by in a flash
and appears on first cmos setup page
So Award bios has a fix for the nforce2.
How about Jesse's bios that can fix the
problem without a kernel patch, as my
Award bios is doing? What kind of bios
is that you have, Jesse?
My Award bios does not make any way for
me to have ioapic edge timer turn on,
though. I need a patch to get that on.
Also I don't have a cpu disconnect choice in
setup and by running temp range 41C to 48C
I guess cpu disconnect is not on. 48C once in
a while does not hurt anything though.  -Bob

Thanks for explaining. We got some new functionality
just by turning nmi_watchdog on but I don't know if
anybody has learned anything from the extra debug
have they, as far as this nforce2 timing thing?     -Bob
