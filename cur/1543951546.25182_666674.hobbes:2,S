Subject: [patch 3/6] Guest page hinting: mlocked pages.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Add code to get mlock() working with guest page hinting. The problem
with mlock is that locked pages may not be removed from page cache.
That means they need to be stable. page_make_volatile needs a way to
check if a page has been locked. To avoid traversing vma lists - which
would hurt performance a lot - a field is added in the struct
address_space. This field is set in mlock_fixup if a vma gets mlocked.
The bit never gets removed - once a file had an mlocked vma all future
pages added to it will stay stable.
The pages of an mlocked area are made present in the linux page table by
a call to make_pages_present which calls get_user_pages and follow_page.
The follow_page function is called for each page in the mlocked vma,
if the VM_LOCKED bit in the vma flags is set the page is made stable.
