It's hard to test the IPv6 server until we have an IPv6 client I
guess, so thanks for the code review, even though we aren't going to
end up using that code...

Do you?  It's surely a lot better than code duplication, and it is

And what do you do if it isn't?
Log an error and drop the packet I guess.
I'll see what I can do.
