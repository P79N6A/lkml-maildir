     Huh?  That seems very bizarre;  I know that some early Slackwares
     really didn't like it when you had a SCSI disk and IDE CD-ROM
     (or visa-versa) and would insist on trying to lilo a boot sector
     onto the CD, but I'd think that that would all be solved by now.
     Certainly Mastodon doesn't have any trouble doing this, and it's a
     distribution I do as a hobby (of course I pretty aggressively trim
     away SCSI support <to nothing more than Aha1542,1740,2940 and
     friends, BusLogic, NCR810, AMD, and Advansys>, because SCSI has
     become Too Damn Expensive for mere mortals.)
     Fitting PCMCIA card services onto the install floppy is, on the
     other hand, a complete nightmare:   libc4 + BASIC + the installer
     + insmod + all the pcmcia modules + a diagnostic shell == 10k
     larger than a 1.44 floppy.   Aaaaarrrrgggghhhh!   A hybrid card
     services stack, where tcic.o, i8<mumble>.o, and pcmcia_core.o are
     built into the kernel, but all the drivers and cs layers are left
     in userspace might solve this problem, at least until the next
     major release bloats up the kernel by 100k :-(

     david parsons \bi/ I dread fitting 2.2 into Mastodon. Floppies aren't
                    \/   getting any bigger, and I don't know of any small
			  bootstrap loaders that can load arbitrary images
			                                       for initrds
