There ought to be one more option... checkpoint the process. This is as
drastic as a coredump, but makes it possible to restart the process later.
Hopefully the process would not require more buffers - the current resident
pages would be the output buffers, and as the I/O completes, they could
be reused to save the swapped out pages into the checkpoint file. Eventually
the entire process  is saved, but the resident+swap memory would be freed.
Checkpoint is a very usefull capability, especially for those long running
CPU intensive processes. It can provide protection against power failures
(by making checkpoints periodically), recovery - the process can be restarted,
and, when resources are short, saved for later execution.
