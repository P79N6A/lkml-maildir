Well, someone obviously played with the SELECTs, and broke the bcm43xx driver.
Now I've got a patch that I believe gets the SELECTs right and fixes
the driver, so
what is wrong?

Yes, it's a 4311 rev 01, but I'm probably was just too lame to upgrade the
firmware or something. :E
I really don't get it, what is going on here? You state that the new b32 driver
has problems on some hardware, where the old bcm43xx driver just works.
And at the same time, you are surprised that I "refuse" to use the b43 driver
and push patches for the bcm43xx driver you broke... Oh, really, why?!
