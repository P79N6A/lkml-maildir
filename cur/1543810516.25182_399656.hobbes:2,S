The problem is that at least on the e1000 it only applies to some of the 
many PCI-IDs it supports. So the original patch had an long ugly switch
with PCI IDs to check it. I suggested to use driver_data for it then,
but Kenji-San ended up with this new field.  I actually like the idea
of the new field because it would allow to add such things very easily
without adding lots of code.
it's not an uncommon situation. e.g. consider driver A which supports
a lot of PCI-IDs but MSI only works on a few of them. How do you
handle this? Add an ugly switch that will bitrot? Or put all the 
information into a single place which is the pci_device_id array.
I prefer the later solution. 
Of course there are some boundaries that shouldn't be exceeded here.
It probably only makes sense for parameters that are simple boolean,
nothing more complicated. But for that it's quite nice.
