Hi Rohit,

Ah.  Is that RedHat's 2.4.7?

As Francois says, check /proc/filesystems.  If you don't find ntfs
there, you'll have to build a new kernel (not as scary as it sounds).
  
http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Kernel-HOWTO.html
covers ALL the details.  If you have a RedHat system, then install the
kernel source and you'll find a .config that matches your system.  You
just need to select NTFS support.
If you have any more questions or problems please go to our NTFS help
