Unless it is native and legacy addressed on the mainboard via the system
bios, Linux can not query the proper geometry.
I have always argued to defautl to LBA when beyond 8.4GB, but people want
to use the orphan sectors, why ... ??  Best guess is not wanting to leave
used sectors.  The was a holy war some time back and I gave up on the
issue.  CHS is dead, but it lives as a Zombie until there are only drives
which support 48-bit feature sets in existance.  Then the problem goes
away.
