it might have been so a few years ago but it's changing slowly but 
surely - BSD is becoming more and more irrelevant. What matters mostly 
to app writers these days: "is it in most Linux distros" - and the key 
to that is upstream kernel support and glibc support. The days of BSD 
(and UNIX) are pretty much numbered. (I'm not against standardizing APIs 
in POSIX of course - the BSDs tend to follow the Linux APIs in that area 
with a few years lag.)
