 Hi,
 a module compiled for kernel 2.4.19-ac4, with CONFIG_MODVERSIONS, and
importing flush_signals() from kernel, fails to load, reporting
"unresolved symbol flush_signals_xxxxxxxx".
 The problem is that the type of the argument passed to flush_signals()
has been changed from "struct task_struct *" to "task_t *" in sched.h,
but it remains unchanged in kernel/signal.c. The same happens with
flush_signal_handlers().
 Sorry if this is a known issue.
Regargs,
Juanma
