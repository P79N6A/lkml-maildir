The START/STOP unit command (0x1b) will, with some devices, shut down
the drive motor. However, this command is optional and not implemented
on all drives.
Further, the first READ/WRITE, etc., access does not automatically
restart the drive. You have to specifically restart it. An attempt
to READ/WRITE from a stopped drive will return a not-ready error.
It takes quite a bit of time to get a drive back up and running after
it has been shut down.
If your drives are noisy, check their mounting. The CPU fan on my
system is louder than the SCSI drives.
