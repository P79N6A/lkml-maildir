Perhaps a nicer way to do this is to add a compile warning or error:
#warning "arch/i386/mach-pc9800 unmaintained since xx/xx/xx, nominated
for removal xx/xx/xx if unclaimed"
..where the second date is, say, 3+ months after the warning goes in.
Then people can nominate stuff for removal with one liners and users
will get ample opportunity to complain.
