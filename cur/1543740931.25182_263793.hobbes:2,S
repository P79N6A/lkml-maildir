what? the point of alloc_pages is to allow people to allocate memory,
what's the difference of 1 2M allocation and 512 4k allocations? No
difference at all. Infact if something the 512 4k allocations hurts a
lot more since they can fragment the memory, while the single 2M
allocation will not fragment the memory. So if you really want to limit
something you should do the exact opposite of what the allocator is
doing.

yes, it makes little difference, this is why it doesn't hurt that much.

2.4 has everything functionally properly but it has no
pages_min/low/high, it only has the watermarks. Infact the watermarks
_are_ low/min/high. That's what I'm forward porting to 2.6 (besides
fixing minor mostly not noticeable but harmful bits like the order
nosense described above).
