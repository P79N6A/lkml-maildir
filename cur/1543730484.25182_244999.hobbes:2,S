I am able to generate unbounded latencies in kswapd by running `make
-j12' for any C++ program that uses KDE/Qt.  The build will allocate all
available RAM, then all available swap, then the machine grinds to a
halt.
I am not sure this is solvable though.  If you fire off a bunch of
processes that try to allocate way more memory than is physically
available then you will have worse problems than latency.
