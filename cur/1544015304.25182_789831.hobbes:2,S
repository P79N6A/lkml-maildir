If you mean, does pppol2tp work with the patches applied when no
namespace is configured, yes it does.
But to test this patch, I ran two l2tp daemons (in different namespaces
on the same box) and used the veth device to connect them. The failure
happened on the first l2tp session create because each side tried to
create a ppp interface called ppp0.
Should all interface names be unique across the system even when netns
is used? If so, then ppp_generic needs to assign system-wide unique ppp
unit numbers.
