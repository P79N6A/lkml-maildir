(this is directed to linux-kernel just this once; future announcements
will be limited to the linux-net and netdev mailing lists.)
A new version of ethtool was just posted on its homepage, at
	
http://sf.net/projects/gkernel/
This version adds Wake-on-LAN support courtesy of Tim Hockin.
You need kernel 2.4.9 or later, hardware which supports Wake-on-LAN, and
a driver which supports Wake-on-LAN to take advantage of this.
Since it takes a little while for SourceForge's database to post the new
file locations, you can optionally use this direct (and permanent) link:
http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/gkernel/ethtool-1.3.tar.gz
What is ethtool?
ethtool is a general diagnostic utility for your network adapter.  It
allows for general media selection, interrupt-based coalescing and
mitigation control, NIC diagnostics, and Wake-on-LAN manipulation.
