I remember inserting a "nop" into a loop and it went significantly
faster on a Pentium Pro :)

If we had enough developer resources to write the whole thing in good
assembly, then for _sure_ we'd have enough to write a perfect compiler!
I would argue that the most powerful algorithmic transformations are a
nightmare in C, too.  Less so, though.
