This is certainly true, but as you observe below it's a fair bit more
fiddly to specify in the API. I wasn't sure how much people recursive
bind mounts, so I figured I'd throw out this simpler version first.

The "flags" argument could be the same as for regular mount, and
contain the mnt_flags - so the extra argument could maybe usefully be
a "mnt_flags_mask", to indicate which flags we actually care about
overriding.
What would happen when an existing super-block flag changes to become
a per-mount flag (e.g. per-mount read-only)? I think that would just
fit in with the "mask" idea, as long as we complained if any bits in
mnt_flags_mask weren't actually per-mount settable.
Being able to mask/set mount flags might be useful on a remount too,
since there's no clean way to get the existing mount flags for a mount
other than by scanning /proc/mounts. So an alternative to a separate
system call would be a new mnt_flag_mask argument to mount() (whose
presence would be indicated by a flag bit being set in the main flags)
which would be used to control which bits were set cleared for
remount/bind calls. Seems a bit wasteful of bits though. If we turned
"flags" into an (optionally) 64-bit argument then we'd have plenty of
bits to be able to specify both a "set" bit and a "mask" bit for each,
without needing a new syscall.
