The problem scenario was that only one configuration
is valid at a time ... it would have been clearer if
both the add-on boards used CS1, so that device would
be either ads7864 _or_ at25640a, but not both.

That wiring can be through an expansion connector though, which
is what I meant when I wrote that it's "vaguely hotplug-ish".
Example, the mainboard could have some SPI devices hard-wired,
on CS0 and CS2, while each different plugin board might add very
different devices on CS1 and/or CS3.
In any case, you were the one who also wanted to ship sample USB
peripherals that acted as adapters to various SPI chips... so that
bus adapters would really need to hotplug! :)

Right, but as I had explained, the scenario is that the
SPI devices are on some easily-swapped add-on card.
That's a common physical arrangement for small embeddable
boards, because it takes so few wires per device.
Swapping those SPI connectors shouldn't involve changing
the declaration of the controller on the mainboard ...

I'll post a refresh of my patch that seems to me to be
a much better match for those goals.  The refresh includes
some tweaks based on what you sent, but it's still just
one KByte of overhead in the target ROM.  :)
