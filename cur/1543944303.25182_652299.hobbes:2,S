Yes.  A stopped CPU is very visible and hence can change the behaviour of
the system which is being tested.

I don't think you'd want to be poking around in kernel internals while some
of the CPUs are continuing to run.  It sounds rather creepy.  You want
everything to stop.  Including time-related things.
Bear in mind that one of the things you do with kgdb is to modify kernel
memory - I'd do things like
int foo;
	...
	if (foo == 1)
		special_stuff();
	...
to trigger a particular behaviour at a particular time.  If you're making
multiple changes, you want them "atomic" wrt all CPUs.  (Of course, if you
happeed to breakpoint one CPU while it was partway through reading multiple
locations, you lose.  But that's a teeny window).
OT: another thing you can do with kgdb is error-path testing:
	foo = kmalloc(...)
BP->	if (!foo)
		recover();
put a breakpoint on the !foo test and set foo to zero by hand.
