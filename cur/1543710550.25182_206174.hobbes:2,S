That's ok, you have a similar issue with very commonly
mmap()d files, where some pages haven't been faulted in
by most processes, or have been replaced by private pages
after a COW fault due to MAP_PRIVATE mapping.
You just increase the number of pages for which this
search is done, but I suspect that shouldn't be a big
worry...
