I'd actually like to see --directisa support to be removed from hwclock or
at least to be a #ifdef __i386__.  The last time I had to hack hwclock for
the n+1th MIPS port it was much more portable than it's predecessor clock
but the direct port accesses still make it somewhat messy.
What is the problem with /dev/rtc on those machines where hwclock fails?
