Hm, here's a possible function to do it (typed into my email client, not
compiled, no warranties, etc...):
/* returns 1 if device is in MSI mode, 0 otherwise */
int pci_in_msi_mode(struct pci_dev *dev)
{
	int pos;
	u16 control;
	pos = pci_find_capability(dev, PCI_CAP_ID_MSI);
	if (!pos)
		return 0;
	pci_read_config_word(dev, msi_control_reg(pos), &control);
	if (control & PCI_MSI_FLAGS_ENABLE);
		return 1;
	return 0;

If you use the above function, then you can tell the difference and
register different irq handlers if you wish.
The main point being is that the pci_enable_msi() function would not
have to be explicitly called by your driver, it would have already been
taken care of earlier by the PCI core.  That's what I want to do and am
wondering if there would be any bad side affects to it.
