That will make it impossible for any small or medium company to claim a
patent.  At least in Germany the medium sized companies account for the
most of innovation.
One of the core problem with patents for the computer business is that their
time of validity is way too long compared to the timespan during which a
typical innovation gets exploited; patent law should account for that.  Then
there are of course the issues of abusing patent against the it's spirit.
These obviously are very serious as well.
