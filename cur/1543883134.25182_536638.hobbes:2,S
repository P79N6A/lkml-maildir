My problem with the proposed scheme is not that it uses large pages,
but rather that it requires large pages.  So in the mmc case you would
go from getting 20MB/s soon after the system booted to failing to be
able to do I/O at all a couple of days later when memory gets
fragmented.
I think a reliable 8MB/s is much better than an unreliable 20MB/s.
With your bounce buffer scheme it seems probable that we can even
get a reliable 20MB/s.
So I'm interested to hear that we have several in tree users that
could benefit.
I do think large block support if we don't require large pages makes
sense.
