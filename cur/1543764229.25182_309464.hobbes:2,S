Well I think extends is one way to look at the subsystem objects,
Couldn't it also be said that these objects from each subsystem have just
a relationship (parent / child, etc). As reference counting has been
implemented in each subsystem sometimes interfaces that cross subsystem
boundaries (had / have) not been converted to use similar life time rules.
Well your solution tries to solve the problem by creating a new larger
object that contains both of the old objects. Another solution would be to
use a consistent lifetime rules and stay with smaller objects. Unless
going to large objects helps with allocation fragmentation or we get some
other benefit it would seem that these combined structures may sometime in
the future limit creation of lighter or flexible objects.
It would appear another solution is that when you allocate a resource from
another subsystem (i.e. blk_init_queue) that both subsystems participate
in the same reference counting model and in the allocation routine you
past in your object to be referenced counted by the allocating subsystem.
Then when it is time to shutdown you do not free the others subsystems
object directly, but use the normal release routines.
