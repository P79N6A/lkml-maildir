I haven't looked at it, in depth, today but one of the problems I saw was the 
apparent loopholes in the text. No specifics, but I remember thinking "a 
lawyer would have a field day with this - dozens of ways they could sidestep 
these issues"

Agreed. I'm still stuck trying to keep the language concise and understandable 
without delving into the descriptive flights of fancy I enjoy. (I write a lot 
more fiction than I do code, even though I started writing code a long time 
before I started on fiction)

What I was getting at, here, is that the GPLv3 isn't backwards compatible with 
GPLv2, because you aren't allowed to remove rights from the GPLv3. Remember, 
there are rights encoded in the GPLv3 that don't appear in v2. In fact, if 
you want to use GPLv3 code in a GPLv2 project you have to use GPLv3. For some 
projects, like the Linux Kernel, the upgrade is impossible to accomplish.

Yes. I almost replied "-ENOPARSE" because, when I first read it, I parsed it 
as "by depriving [the authors] of the freedoms they're morally entitled to 
have". When my brain finally rebooted after that bought of idiocy I was able 
to parse it properly.
