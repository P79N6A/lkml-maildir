The Linux Test Project is an open source project originated by SGI and
recently joined by IBM and OSDL to provide a collection of tools for
testing the Linux kernel, and Linux in general.  The project consists of
well over 100 individual testcases and a test driver to automate
execution of the tests.  This release includes many new tests and
updates.
-Over 20 reliability network tests for remote procedure calls, network
file systems, multicast, and various network commands.
-An assortment of robustness tests that cover pthreads, memory,
filesystems, and disk I/O
-Several tests for commands commonly used in an application development
environment.
