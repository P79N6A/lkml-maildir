Yes :-(

It does solve the __GFP_IO issue but triggers another lockup later.

That's what I think. But from my observations I get the impression
that balancing the vm for big shm loads will not work. So the second
approach is perhaps what we have to do to get it working.
Actually I would appreciate some hints, where I could hook into the vm
if I implement a swap_shm_page() which could be called from the
vm. Can I simply call add_to_lru_cache or do I need to add it to the
page cache...
