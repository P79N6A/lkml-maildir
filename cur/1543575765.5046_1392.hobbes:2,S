| I should add that I didn't have these lockups in test12-pre8.
just for statistical purposes, test12 has been running problem-free 
here on a k6-2-550 (running at 500), glibc-2.2, built with 
gcc-2.95-2, since about an hour after it was announced. no anomalies 
at all, and the cd reader has become reliable again. in X the entire 
time, and heavy system activity with a wide variety of applications.
