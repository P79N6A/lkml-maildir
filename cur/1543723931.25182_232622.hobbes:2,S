I did a bit more messing around with GCC and it seems in 
int x = 4;
if (x == 0xDEADBEEF) { ... }
It will warn that 0xDEADBEEF is unsigned (which it isn't).  Either
there is an obscure clause in the C standard [I personally don't have a
copy of C99 nor do I plan on reading it for this] or GCC cause an
incorrect diagnostic [which isn't in violation of the standards...]
Really GCC should just warn that 0xDEADBEEF is not a valid int constant
[for portability sake...].   It's simple, any constant > 16-bits should
have a UL/L or ULL/LL suffix.
