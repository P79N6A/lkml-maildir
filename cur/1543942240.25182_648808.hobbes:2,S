The difference is quite simple:
	a		- this section occupies address space
	w		- this section is writable
	x		- this section is executable
	progbits	- this section has data in the file
In contrast, a nobits section is implicitly zero-filled.
By default:
.bss 	is (aw,nobits).
.data 	is (aw,progbits).
.rodata	is (a,progbits).
.text	is (ax,progbits).
Since .bss is nobits, it doesn't occupy any space in the executable, and 
is zero-filled by the loader.
