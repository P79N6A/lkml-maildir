Is there a standard for that? Or is it an opaque type that you have
defined this way?

Posix only defines a process and a thread clock. This is much more.

The proper information to realize these clocks is only available on the
kernel level. A clean API for that would remove lots of code that
currently exists in glibc.
I wonder how glibc will realize access to special timer hardware. Will
glibc be able load device drivers for timer chips?
