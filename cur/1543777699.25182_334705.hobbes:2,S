Hi Linus,
I get several warnings like the one below when building with gcc4.0. 
net/ipv4/netfilter/ip_conntrack_core.c: In function 'ip_conntrack_in':
net/ipv4/netfilter/ip_conntrack_core.c:612: warning: 'set_reply' may be used 
uninitialized in this function
The trivial patch below fixes it:

However, being so trivial, is it at all worth it fixing them or should I just 
ignore them?
