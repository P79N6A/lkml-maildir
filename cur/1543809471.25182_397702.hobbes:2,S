This is a good thing?

Yup.  Apparently with SAS, the controllers are far more likely to fail than 
the drives.

Or you could use raid and get complete redundancy rather than two paths to the 
same single point of failure.  Your choice.

If it uses a PHY then it's gig ethernet under the covers.  Each hop is a point 
to point connection, but throwing switches in there isn't exactly a new 
problem.  When demand arrives, I expect supply will catch up.

I still don't see why drives are expected to be more reliable than 
controllers.
I think the most paranoid setup I've seen was six disks holding two disks 
worth of information.  A three way raid-5, mirrored.  It could lose any three 
disks out of the group, and several 4 disk combinations.  If six SATA drives 
are cheaper than two SAS drives.  (Yeah, the CRC calculation eats CPU and 
flushes your cache.  So what?)
I keep thinking there should be something more useful you could do than "hot 
spare" with extra disks in simple RAID 5, some way of dynamically scaling 
more parity info.  But it's not an area I play in much...

Only because the firmware doesn't support it.  (I.E. It's an intentional lack 
of support.)

I was under the impression that SATA came first and SAS surrounded it with 
unnecessary extensions so they could charge more money.  But then I've 
largely ignored SAS (as has everyone else I know outside of Dell), so I can't 
claim to be an expert here...
