I'd expect something that you can extract with:
~# cd /
/# tar xzf /path/to/kernel.tar.gz --no-same-owner
That tar file should contain:
./boot/vmlinux-<version>	# unstripped vmlinux file for debugging
./boot/vmlinuz-<version>	# bootable file - non-i386 archs obviously
				# need different files
./boot/System.map-<version>	# Map file for 'ps' and for me
./boot/config-<version>		# To recreate the kernel
./boot/patch-<version>		# Only if it was requested at .tar.gz
				# build time, containing a -Nurp style
				# diff to a clean source tree (which
				# needs to be specified then)
./lib/modules/<kversion>/*	# Modules
The tricky part is the <version> and/or <kversion> part. For my personal
use, version is like kversion, but extended with whatever the user
specified. kversion is Makefile's $(KERNELRELEASE).
As I stated, it's clumsy at ./lib/modules/<kversion>/*, because you'll
probably overwrite other modules of the same kernel version with a
different(ly compiled) .tar.gz .  The tarball's name should exactly
contain <version> in it's name so that a script that extracts is can
place a proper symlink within ./boot easily.
