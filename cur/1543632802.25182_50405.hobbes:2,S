We've established that pretty comprehensively. Any bit of ACPI causes

It may be that the IRQ routing and other bits of ACPI logic need to know
that their are dependancies. We handle that already for other legacy
stuff. If you don't have an MCA bus we don't do MCA bus enumerating. If
you don't have a PCI BIOS32 irq router we don't consider that option and
so forth. Having ACPI IRQ/Enumeration code that says if(!acpi) return
NULL isnt that demanding
