Take it the other direction - people *also* actively choose a distro based
on some reason (to be honest, a major reason I ended up in RedHat/Fedora
rather than some other Linux distro or even a *bsd was because at the time
I needed a *nix with an X server that supported the i810 chipset, they were
the only ones shipping one pre-built).
On the flip side, I freely admit that the vast majority of things Andrew
puts in his kernel basically get flooded to me, because installing the
entire -mm patch is a lot easier than installing half of it....
