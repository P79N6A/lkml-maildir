Is there any way how this would be resolved?
I can easily imagine that two courts, no matter whether they are in the 
same or different countries, would decide differently in grey areas like 
non-GPL modules or the GPLv2 and private keys.
If the two courts are in the same country there's usually a higher court 
above both that can resolve this. But what if let's say the highest 
court in the USA and the highest court in Germany would disagree on such 
a matter?
