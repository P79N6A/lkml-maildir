Basically yes. I've merged the update patch, which was not yet added
to -mm, did some cosmetic code changes, and updated the patch headers.
There's one open point, that I think we haven't really explored, and
that is the propagation semantics.  I think you had the idea, that a
propagated mount should inherit ownership from the parent into which
it was propagated.
That sounds good if everyone agrees?
