I think we should simply define a macro for use in the kernel, e.g. in
<asm/types.h>. There already is a BITS_PER_LONG macro in there, maybe
we can add an exported __BITS_PER_LONG there that checks for the right
macro on each architecture.
On parisc, there is a major confusion in this area, at some point, all
checks for __LP64__ got replaced with CONFIG_64BIT there. While I have
not understood what the problem with __LP64__ was, the check for
CONFIG_64BIT on parisc user space looks very wrong.
