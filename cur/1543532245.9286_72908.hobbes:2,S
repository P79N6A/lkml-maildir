Peter,
Please trust that I know the world is full of broken hardware, and even
if you follow the exact OEM directions for the hardware, it still can go
wrong.  I see some of the worst night/day-mares in ATA hardware than
anyone can imagine.
There is only three possible solutions for the 05/14/99 (and older) AWARD
BIOS problem........
1) Users purchase an ADD-ON card that will handle the large drives.
2) Users issues a bogus geometry to the BIOS and we ignore it and use the
entire disk.
3) Users runs OEM capacity shrinking tool. Depend on Linux to issue
READ/SET_MAX_ADDRESS and update the values "soft" and not clobber the
"protected memory area".  In principle, a reboot/power-cycle will revert
the capacity back to 32GB so that one may reboot with out a hang.
This is the preferred order in my book.
FYI, I am working with the ADD-ON card manufacturers to get them to
correct their BIOS code to prevent this problem.
Cheers,

I only got wierded out because of potential partition fragmentation if any
goes wrong.
