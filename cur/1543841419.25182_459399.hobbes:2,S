The individual share within the group may not be important, but the 
relative priority might be.
We have instances were we would like to express something like:
--these tasks are all grouped together as "maintenance" tasks, and 
should be guaranteed 3% of the system together
	--within the maintenance tasks, my network heartbeat application is the 
most latency sensitive, so I want it to be higher-priority than the 
other maintenance tasks
 From my point of view, task group cpu allocation and relative task 
priority should be orthogonal.
First you pick a task group (based on cpu share, priority, etc.) then 
within the group you pick the task with highest priority.
This was something that CKRM did right (IMHO).
