Sorry about the silence. The last month I have been devoting all my time 
to look for work. As of next month I will be out of money. Meaning no home 
to live in thus no internet. Because of this I like to have someone 
replace me. Antonino you have done some really great work. I like you to 
replace me to work with Geert to further the framebuffer layer. I still 
have a month left to live on so I will contribute as much as I can. Thank 
you.
