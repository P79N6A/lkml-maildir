Good. I added this to
http://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/partitions/partition_types-2.html#above1024chs
Now that I looked at this disk.c anyway: it has a table of
partition types, and it seems I collect these.
(See 
http://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/partitions/partition_types-1.html
 )
Are types 57 and 77, labeled "VNDI Partition", actually in use?
