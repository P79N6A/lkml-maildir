hi!
..I installed Manfred's patch and the d-link-card was now able to
reset after the tx-timeout-error. that means that the card was again
reachable after the error. but the smb-transfer-connection-error still
appeared. then I set "static int debug = 2;" in the patched
via-rhine.c to get more debug-informations but from then on the card
worked without errors!? I tested this several times and produced a lot
of network traffic - but there was no more error-message!
..but I will do some more tests to get sure. ;-)
bye.
