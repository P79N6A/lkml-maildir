I can't help you with your second issue, but as for the first:

Blame this one on Windows. One of the options that can be set in the
Windows shell is to turn any all-lowercase name into all-uppercase on the
display (I believe this option is on by default). I'm in Linux right now,
so I can't tell you exactly what the option is, but I hope this sets you
on the right path...
(BTW, I *think* that, when Windows has this option on, if you make a
directory called "test" then it'll change the name to "TEST" for you, at
least on-screen)
