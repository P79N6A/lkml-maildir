I have a machine with an Adaptec 2940U2W adapter running 2.6.11.  When I
try to go into standby like so:
    echo standby > /sys/power/state
this is what happens:
Stopping tasks:
===============================================================
stopping tasks failed (1 tasks remaining)
Restarting tasks...<6> Strange, ahc_dv_0 not stopped
done 
The machine fails to suspend, and ahc_dv_0 is now wedged, consuming all
available CPU until reboot.
