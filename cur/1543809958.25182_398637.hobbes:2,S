Hello everybody,
DIPC (Distributed IPC) is a system software that provides distributed access
to messages, semaphores, and shared memory segments. It can be used to
transparently exchange data between distributed applications.
As another step in porting DIPC to Linux 2.6.x, the example programmes in 
2.1-alpha3 version of DIPC now work on a single machine (they haven't been 
tried over a network). Please let me know of your experience if you 
installed and tested DIPC, especially in a distributed environment.
You can download this version of DIPC from:
