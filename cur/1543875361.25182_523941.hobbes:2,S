Hi Christoph and Anil,
Thank you for your comments.

OK, I agree. I had chosen a confusable name.

Thank you.

I'd like to change that to prepare_to_unregister_kprobe(p) instead of
disable_kprobe(p).
I think Josh and other people want interfaces to disable/reenable all
probes at once when the sysrq is pressed.
So, IMHO, these interfaces should use a global (and per-cpu?) flag which
controls whether kprobes calls user-defined handler or not, instead of
self-modifying.
For example,
if (p && p->pre_handler && kprobe_enable) {
                           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   ...
}
But, I think this would be another story.
I'd like to discuss this topic in other mails.

And also, I'd like to change it to unregister_prepared_kprobes().
What would you think about this idea?
Thanks,
