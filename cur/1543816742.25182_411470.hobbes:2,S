This type is called OS-level virtualization, or kernel-level 
virtualization, or partitioning. Basically it allows to create a 
compartments (in OpenVZ we call them VEs -- Virtual Environments) in 
which you can run full *unmodified* Linux system (but the kernel itself 
-- it is one single kernel common for all compartments). That means that 
with this approach you can not run OSs other than Linux, but different 
Linux distributions are working just fine.

It is actually not a future goal, but rather a reality. Since os-level 
virtualization overhead is very low (1-2 per cent or so), one can run 
hundreds of VEs.
Say, on a box with 1GB of RAM OpenVZ [
http://openvz.org/
] is able to run 
about 150 VEs each one having init, apache (serving static content), 
sendmail, sshd, cron etc. running. Actually you can run more, but with 
the aggressive swapping so performance drops considerably. So it all 
mostly depends on RAM, and I'd say that 500+ VEs on a 4GB box should run 
just fine. Of course it all depends on what you run inside those VEs.

This is a different story. If you want to run different OSs on the same 
box -- use emulation or paravirtualization.
If you are happy to stick to Linux on this box -- use OS-level 
virtualization. Aside from the best possible scalability and 
performance, the other benefit of this approach is dynamic resource 
management -- since there is a single kernel managing all the resources 
such as RAM, you can easily tune all those resources runtime. More to 
say, you can make one VE use more RAM while nobody else it using it, 
leading to much better resource usage. And since there is one single 
kernel that manages everything, you could do nice tricks like VE 
checkpointing, live migration, etc. etc.
