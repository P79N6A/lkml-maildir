Hello??
The latest 2.0 version of the Linux kernel is:  	2.0.40 	2004-02-08
07:13 UTC 	F 	V 	VI 	  	Changelog
You have FOUR.  2.6, 2.4, 2.2, 2.0
In my scheme it's time to let go of 2.0; support moves to 2.6, 2.4, 2.2.
~ Development goes to 2.7, in the same way the 2.6 model is done now (so
that it's always usable and needs no feature freeze etc before release).
~ In 6 months, 2.2 support is dropped, support moves to 2.8, 2.4, 2.2
with development on 2.9.  Support includes bugfixes (security and
otherwise) only.

| Distributors get paid by their customers to do the long term backporting
