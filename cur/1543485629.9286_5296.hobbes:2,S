    I don't know about a formal standard, either.
    Nevertheless, in my initial post, I wasn't talking about rmdir (2), I was
    talking about rmdir(1)'s behaviour on linux-2.[12].x breaking gcc/fixincludes
    for building cross-compilers.
A formal standard for rmdir(1) can be found in POSIX.2
(I have the 1993-12-22 edition here).
It says:
"The rmdir utility shall remove the directory entry specified by each operand,
which shall refer to an empty directory."
No exception is made for ".".
Thus, gcc/fixincludes needs fixing.
