For what it's worth, I still haven't found exactly what is causing
this problem, but it has shown up more than once. It seems that it
might have something to do with repeatedly loading and unloading the
psmouse driver using different protocol options (proto=bare|imps|exps)
and loading and unloading gpm (I said gdm previously, which was a
mistake) using different -t (type) options (ps2|imps2|auto) and/or
different mouse devices (/dev/mouse or /dev/input/mice). I've done
lots of things to try to reproduce this behavior, but nothing yet
seems to make it happen every time.
I haven't used the laptop 'normally' very much yet, so I don't know if
this problem shows up in normal use or just under strange
circumstances like setup and testing.
When it does show up, the mouse cursor moves quickly up to the
upper-right corner of the display - be it the X display or on the
console with gpm - when the lower or right sides of the touchpad are
used. Using the other areas of the touchpad produces normal curser
movement.
I'll continue to test things to see what might be causing problems.
One thing I can contribute which showed up after this problem is an
Oops during a boot. It could be totally unrelated and it's only
happened once (a reboot produced no such Oops), but here it is:

If anything looks odd or unlike normal Oops output, I was unable to
capture it digitally and so had to type it out longhand, which could
contribute to typos :-/ . Also, since it seems to have occured between
the swsusp code loading, I may need to submit it to those guys
instead.
HTH. Thanks.
