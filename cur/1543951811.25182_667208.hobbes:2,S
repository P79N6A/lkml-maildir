True, but while this change simplifies the code a bit, the semantics
seem more muddled - devcg will be enforcing when CONFIG_CGROUP_DEV=y
and:
	SECURITY=n or
	rootplug is enabled
	capabilities is enabled
	smack is enabled
	selinux+capabilities is enabled
It will not be enforcing when
	dummy is loaded
	only selinux (and not capabilities) is loaded
If that's ok with people then I'm fine with it.  I suppose it should be
explained in the CONFIG_CGROUP_DEV help section, which it isn't in this
version I'm about to set.  Patch hitting the wire in a minute.
thanks,
