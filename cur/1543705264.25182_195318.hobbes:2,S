What is needed for the 2.6 kernel is rather volatile
(and maybe the present kernel version is not quite final yet).
But setkeycodes does ioctl(fd,KDSETKEYCODE,&a) where 
                a.keycode = atoi(argv[2]);
                a.scancode = strtol(argv[1], &ep, 16);
                if (a.scancode >= 0xe000) {
                        a.scancode -= 0xe000;
                        a.scancode += 128;      /* some kernels needed +256 */
                }
The 2.6.1 kernel is still very messy, with code
        if (atkbd->emul) {
                if (--atkbd->emul)
                        goto out;
                code |= (atkbd->set != 3) ? 0x80 : 0x100;
        }
where the representation of the e0 prefix depends on the current scancode mode.
A bad idea.

kbdrate first tries the KDKBDREP ioctl, then the KIOCSRATE ioctl,
and if both fail it will try to write to /dev/port.
