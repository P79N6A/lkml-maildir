This patch (as654) adds a line to gdth.c that was removed by accident as
part of the big notifier-chain update patch series.

The patched source file for gdth.c you sent wasn't quite right.  The
reboot-notifier block was registered but never unregistered!  An extra
line of code got removed by mistake; this patch puts it back.
The driver has other issues -- it uses the old SCSI host model and it's 
subject to races as a result.  Really the notifier block should be 
registered when the module initializes and unregistered when the module 
exits.  But at least this will now be no worse than it was before.
