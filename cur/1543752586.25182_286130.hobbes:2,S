More info comes.  The embedded system has a single PCI slot.  So I tried 
the PCI card with the RICOH CARDBUS support on it in the embedded 
system, and plugged in the problem CARDBUS card into the RICOH board 
before powering up.  This is analogous to the case before, when the 
motherboard resident TI1520 chip was in play. 
Now the system can load yenta_socket fine.
So it is definitely not a power supply _capacity_ issue, although I 
suppose it could be power availability timing issue.  This experiment 
tends to put more doubt into the TI1520 chip and the yenta support for it.
