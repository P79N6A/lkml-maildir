It was me.
Reason: 
	I misunderstood your suggestion down_timeout() as "down and hold
	a semaphore until timeout" instead of "try until timeout to get
	the semaphore". I suggested using waitqueues for this.
But now that I understand, what you really want, I agree that this is
very useful and also agree that the kernel should provide it.
I don't think that I prevented it from being accepted, but my opinion
about it might had have the wrong influence.
I'm really sorry, that this simple communication problem caused you,
the ACPI development and users such a big pain.
PS: And I still think that semaphores with a maximum hold time are a bad
    idea in the linux kernel. But this is just *my* opinion ;-)
