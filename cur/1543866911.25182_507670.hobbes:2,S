You have a Maxtor connected to that port, right?  That's caused by 
firmware bug.  Future kernels will consider that condition as protocol 
violation and blacklist the drive such that NCQ is not used on it.  I 
think it can be dangerous on rare corner/error cases but there hasn't 
been any actual report of problems caused by that, so no need to worry 
about it too much.  If it bothers you, you can turn NCQ off using sysfs 
node.  Take a look at FAQ section of 
http://linux-ata.org

Slightly OT, but it's generally a good idea to use LABELs to access 
filesystems.  With so many ports and EH dynamics including hotplug, it's 
much more difficult to keep device names persistent and remember them.

That's sil4726's config device acting weird.  When reset as a normal 
device (not PMP device), sil4726 acts as a normal ATA device which is 
used to configure how the chip behaves.  Unfortunately, the emulation 
seems to contain some flaws and cause lots of delays as you've seen. 
I'm attaching a patch to clear TF before IDENTIFY which fixes similar 
IDENTIFY failures on buggy ATAPI devices.

This problem is likely to be fixed by clearing TF before IDENTIFY.
So, please test the attached patch and report the result.
