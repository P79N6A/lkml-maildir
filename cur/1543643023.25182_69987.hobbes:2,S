I can't disagree with any of that, but the idea of releasing resources
when they are not in use and preventing new use of the resource from the
time of the release request is hardly new to UNIX. It's exactly the way
filespace is treated when a file is unlinked while open.

Which if true doesn't preclude solving the problems it does address.

Clearly there are people who don't agree, and you don't help by insulting
them. I'd like a single solution, but it looks as if Al's idea will work
for filesystems, and it's relatively simple.

Solutions which work are most certainly correct, and no degree of elegance
will make a non-working solution correct for any definition of correct I
use. I think you mean "optimal" here, and clearly an optimal solution is
simple, reliable, efficient, general, and easy to code and understand.
Anything less is subject to improvement, and that certainly applies to
module removal ;-)
