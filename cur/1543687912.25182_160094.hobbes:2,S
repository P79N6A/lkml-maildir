Isn't the confict cause here (just) that one is compiled with gcc 2.x 
and the other with gcc 3.x?
In other words, retry compiling this module on one system with the two 
different kernels, as you want to compare kernel source level interface 
  differences and not kernel ABI (Application Binairy Interface IIRC) 
differences.
