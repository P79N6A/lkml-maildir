In a hardirq context one is bound to a processor and through the slab 
allocator to a slab from which one allocates objects. The slab is per cpu 
and so the slab is reserved for the current context. Nothing can take 
objects away from it. The modifications here would not be needed for that 
context.
I think in general irq context reclaim is doable. Cannot see obvious 
issues on a first superficial pass through rmap.c. The irq holdoff would 
be pretty long though which may make it unacceptable.
