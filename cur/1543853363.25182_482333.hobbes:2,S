We could carry on this argument indefinitely.  Yes, the device_may_wakeup
stuff does work without sysfs.  But it doesn't do anything significant; it
amounts to no more than device_can_wakeup().  AFAIK there's no way to
change the setting of the may_wakeup flag other than via sysfs.  That's
what I meant by "tied".

Things work differently in uhci-hcd.  I still haven't submitted the patch 
to add device_may_wakeup support (although it was written quite a while 
ago and may have been posted to linux-usb-devel; I can't remember).
However even when it is added and may_wakeup is off, autostop will still 
function.  It won't rely on interrupts or other wakeup events, though -- 
instead the root-hub status polling mechanism will be used.
