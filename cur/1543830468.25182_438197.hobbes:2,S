the problem here is not the change in semantics compared
to a real linux system (as there basically is none) but
compared to _other_ technologies like UML or QEMU, which
add the need for bridging and additional interfaces, while
Linux-VServer only focuses on the IP layer ...

why? a set of IPs is quite similar to a single IP (which
is actually a subset), so no real change there, only
IP_ANY means something different for a guest ...

hmm, maybe you should try to optimize linux for Xen then,
as I'm sure it will provide the optimal virtualization
and has all the features folks are looking for (regarding
virtualization)
I thought we are trying to figure a light-weight subset
of isolation and virtualization technologies and methods
which make sense to have in mainline ...

well, we have not even touched the permission issues yet
