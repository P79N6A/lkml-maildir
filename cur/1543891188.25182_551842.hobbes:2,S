Don't those thingies usually have NV cache or backed by battery such
that ORDERED_DRAIN is enough?
The problem is that the interface between the host and a storage device
(ATA or SCSI) is not built to communicate that kind of information
(grouped flush, relaxed ordering...).  I think battery backed
ORDERED_DRAIN combined with fine-grained host queue flush would be
pretty good.  It doesn't require some fancy new interface which isn't
gonna be used widely anyway and can achieve most of performance gain if
the storage plays it smart.
Thanks.
