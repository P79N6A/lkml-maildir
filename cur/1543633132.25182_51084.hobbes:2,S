spot on.  this is why i use a dsp card on my studio workstation; latency
doesn't change (therefore no clicks/pops) when you move the mouse
rapidly.  it sticks right on whatever i set it to (13ms on my card, the
newer ones can do around 1ms)
can't say the same for vst (host cpu powered) instruments/effects.
controller latency DOES matter.
sadly all the host software for the card needs windows or macos.  linux
is MUCH better than windows in areas like this, after all the work Sir
Morton has done to clean up latency.  a thousand blessings upon his
house :-)
