Actually, we have an internal IBM project about to ship that has
requested 5000 physical disks, each multipathed at least once to
each possible node.  They even supposedly have customers ready today.
Yes, they do a lot of virtualization, internal striping, etc. but
they still have done their own math and would like to support 5000
disks on all OS's, including Linux.  Not a problem for most of the
others from what I've heard.
