Heh. Now we're getting even further off-topic. I think we've already just
about lost to the lobotomised masses on that one though - even the
historically clueful BBC have started using the US meaning of 'billion' in
spite of the fact that the word has always meant 10^12 throughout Europe,
not 10^9, and it would be trivial to just avoid the word altogether, to 
avoid ambiguity.
Now I reckon it's just a matter of time before they start spelling colour
without the 'u' - 'because the general public don't know any better'. :)
