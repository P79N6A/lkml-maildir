hm, i'm wondering what you would expect the scheduler to do here?
for this particular test you'll get the best result by renicing X to 
+19! Why? Because, as far as i can see this is a partially 'inverted' 
test of X's scheduling.
While the script is definitely useful (you taught me that nice xterm 
-geom trick to automate the placing of busy xterms :), some caveats do 
apply when interpreting the results:
If you have a kernel 3D driver (which you seem to have, judging by the 
glxgears numbers you are getting) then running 'glxgears' wont involve X 
at all. glxgears just gets its own window and then the kernel driver 
draws straight into it, without any side-trips to X. You can see this 
for yourself by starting glitch1.sh from an ssh terminal, and then 
_totally stop_ the X server via "kill -STOP 12345" - all the xterms will 
stop, the X desktop freezes, but the glxgears instance will still 
happily draw its stuff and wheels are happily turning on the screen.
So in this sense glxgears is a 'CPU hog' workload, largely independent 
of X.
now, by renicing X to -10 and running the xterms you'll definitely hurt 
"CPU hogs" - even if it happens to be a glxgears process that draws 3D 
graphics in a window provided by X. But this is precisely what is 
supposed to happen in this case. You should get the best glxgears 
performance by renicing X to _+19_, and that seems to be happening 
according to your numbers - and that's what happens in my own testing 
too.
