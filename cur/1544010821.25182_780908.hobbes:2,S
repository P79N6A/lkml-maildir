Yes. I should have been more explicit about that when talking about
"adding one byte". At least it's better than adding 8 bytes of
additional data, as in the previous patch.
I haven't checked it, but was told that sk_buff is already tightly
packed. It didn't look like there was a better place to put the byte
either.
