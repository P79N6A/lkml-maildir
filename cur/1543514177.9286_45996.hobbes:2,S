The company I work for, NewMonics, does a lot of work on embedded systems
and we've recently ported our product (a lightweight realtime Java virtual
machine) to Linux.  On some of the embedded systems/PLC's we work with
(specifically, those based on the AMD Elan SC310 and SC300 386
microcontrollers) Linux fails to boot because the keyboard controller is
not there to set the A20 bit.  These machines are headless, keyboardless,
and diskless (except for a small PCMCIA flash card).  With the following
patch, we were able to get our virtual machine running on
Linux under this hardware via a serial port console.
