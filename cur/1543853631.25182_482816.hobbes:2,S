The simple question.  If we turn off the NMI watchdog on 2.6.19-rc5 
does oprofile work?  I believe that is what Andi said.
The description I read was a resource conflict. The resources oprofile
just expects it can used are already in use so we tell it no and
the user space oprofile doesn't cope.
Now I don't know the interface allows us to rename the interfaces
from 1 2 3 to 0 1 2.  If we can then that looks like something we can
fix.  Otherwise from the description I tend to agree with Andi.
The user space application assumed it own hardware that it did not.
Hmm.  I bet if nothing else we could move the NMI watchdog from 0 to 3
and make things work that way...
