I had posted under the topic SMP + EXT3 + AACRAID yesterday about lockups
occuring when I ran a 'dbench 32' on a dual pentium 4 with HT, on an Adaptec
2120S (aacraid) with an ext3 filesystem. So far with my testing on mm3 I
have not had a lockup. 'dbench 32' also is also much faster, from about
60MB/s on 2.6.5 (the few times it did not lock) to 108MB/s on 2.6.5-mm3.
I have SMT scheduler support enabled along with 4K stacks.
2.6.5-mm3+SMP+AACRAID+EXT3= completes
2.6.5+SMP+AACRAID+EXT3= lockup
2.6.5+SMP+AACRAID+EXT2= completes
2.4.21-9REL+SMP+AACRAID+EXT3= lockup
2.4.21-9REL+SMP+AACRAID+EXT2= completes
2.4.21-9REL+SingleProc+AACRAID+EXT3= lockup
2.4.21-9REL+SingleProc+AACRAID+EXT2=completes
2.6.5-mm3 is working for me!
