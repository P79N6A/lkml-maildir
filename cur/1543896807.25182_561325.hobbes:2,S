For testing I'd agree, but not for a kernel that is suppose to be
stable.

Since I've been working with -rt (~2 years now I think) it's clear that
the number of testers of the patch isn't all that high compared to the
stable kernel . There are tons of drivers which get no coverage by -rt
patch users.
So the fact that something similar is in -rt is good, but it's not a
silver bullet ..
