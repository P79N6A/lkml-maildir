Isn't it good time to move v4l2-dvb tree to GIT? I am not aware of any
hg-to-git repo. converter, but I can check with hg and git community.
It could be difficult at first, but I am very confident that there are
many GIT users here than mercurial, and yes your v4l-dvb maintenance
process might change due move from GIT, but atleast you will not have
to internal user meta-data per patch.
