Got it. 
I'm not certain this is actually a problem it may be a feature.
But it does fly in the face of the general principle of just
getting out of roots way so things can get done.
I think we can solve your basic problem by simply doing like:
chdir(/share); mount(.);  To simply avoid the permission problem.
The practical question is how much do we care.

If we are not using usual permissions which user do we use current->uid?
Or do we pass that user someplace?
