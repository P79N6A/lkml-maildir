True but irrelevant because the RTC returns a timestamp.  And it's
quietly understood that the RTC is only an approximation.
The remaining fly in the ointment, if indeed the NTP client doesn't
already do what I've outlined, is that leap seconds aren't reckoned into
NTP broadcasts.  As intimated, this is correctable using leap second
information from zoneinfo.
Even though this is manifestly not a kernel issue, I'll work up a patch
for ntpdate (apparently what I use) and post her, which I'm sure will be
useful for all other NTP clients.
However it is now clear that no special kernel support is required for
leap-seconds, and any such code that's been incorporated needs to be
removed.  Removed I say!
