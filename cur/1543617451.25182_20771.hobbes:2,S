I looked it up; its called class IA.  I don't know if it grows from a
limitation of their scheduler (i.e. they can't calculate priority and be
as fair to interactive tasks as us) or if it offers a fundamental
advantage.  I suspect their are a myriad of things things we can do with
an interactive/GUI scheduling policy.
One thing this is, since their kernel is preemptible, it marks processes
that very much always deserve a scheduling boost based on interactivity,
and thus their interactivity is quite nice.
