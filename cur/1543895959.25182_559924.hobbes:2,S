I'm just not going to let this go.  Stable is synonymous with, well 
ummm, "stable."  That means that I don't have 3000 changes a month, it's 
secure and the unexpected doesn't happen.  It means I can write a 
lecture explaining how git works.  ...do updates... then expect my 
lecture to still work the next day.  It means writing local shell 
scripts and expecting them to work until the NEXT stable release without 
changes.  It means knowing what things WILL break if and when I do go to 
the next version.
Stable is a CHOICE not a punishment.
