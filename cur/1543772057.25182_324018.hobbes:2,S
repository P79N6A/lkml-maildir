I agree that we should get the API correct as soon as we can.  However
I would argue that one property of the correct API would be that
changing the default from MSI turned off to MSI turned on should not
affect the API.
I like Jeff's suggestion of rolling more common code into
pci_enable_device().  However I'm not sure if this fixes the MSI mess
completely -- there may be some devices where the driver wants to test
interrupt generation and disable MSI if it fails.  However this may be
enough of a special case that we can just add a flag to those
particular drivers so that users can manually control the use of MSI.
