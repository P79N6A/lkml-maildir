if there is a "contaminant" inside the kernel, why should one see this only when it`s being inserted (i.e. usually at boot time) ?
i don`t know about the "nvidia(P)..." thing, but i would find it really useful to be able to easily distinguish between the "good" and the "not belonging to this kernel" modules.
i have seem several discussions about "modules which taint the kernel are evil" - so why not pillory them by listing appropriate information with lsmod ?
