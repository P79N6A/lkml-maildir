I tried something like that once... (assuming your "mem=32" is literally
what you tried and you didn't miss something in transcribing to mail...)
mem=32 literally means 32 **bytes** of memory... Try mem=32m - it'll probably
be more like what you intended...
from /usr/src/linux/arch/i386/kernel/setup.c (starting at line 308 in 2.2.12):
                /*
                 * "mem=nopentium" disables the 4MB page tables.
                 * "mem=XXX[kKmM]" overrides the BIOS-reported
                 * memory size
                 */
