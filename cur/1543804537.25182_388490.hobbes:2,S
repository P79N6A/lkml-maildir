There's a Documentation/feature-removal-schedule.txt file. Is not that devfs
and other features were removed suddenly from one day to another. If external
developers don't care about maintaining code in (say) a 6 month timeframe
kernel developers can't do nothing. External developers are encouraged to
merge their code in the main tree anyway.
It's strange that you mention the devfs case. People wanted to remove 
devfs one or maybe two years ago, and Linus and/or akpm decided to kept
it to give people time to migrate. 
Please see the archives to understand why the people who maintains the
kernel and gets their ass kicked when a stable released has a bug decided 
to set up this development model.
