fsx had been added to the Linux Test Project with permission by Apple.
I've integrated the above change.  Any other changes can be submitted to
the LTP list or as a patch on the LTP project page.  fsx is filed in
ltp/testcases/kernel/fs/fsx-linux.
Thank to everyone how dug this up and polished it off.
