From before:
The sha1 (ascii) digests for 16817 files take:
	689497 bytes before compression
	397475 bytes after minigzip
New numbers:
The sha1 (binary) digests for 16817 files take:
	336340 bytes before compression
	334943 bytes after minigzip
So compressing binary digests isn't worth a darn, and compressing ascii
digests gets them down to within 18% of binary digests in size.
