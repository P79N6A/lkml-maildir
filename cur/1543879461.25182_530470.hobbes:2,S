It makes no difference.  struct lockdep_map contains at least one pointer and
so is going to be 8-byte aligned (assuming it's there at all).  struct
rw_semaphore contains at least one pointer/long, so it will be padded out to
8-byte size.
If you want to make a difference, you'd need to add __attribute__((packed))
but you would need to be very careful with that.
