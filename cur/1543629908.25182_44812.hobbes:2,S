khttpd is very much production quality on IA32, and has been since
2.4.0-test1.  TUX2 is not, however, since under load it enters a 99% CPU
busy loop.  You may not have enough load to cause TUX2 to do this, and
TUX1 may not have this problem.

khttpd is extremely dependent on alignment and data sizes -- the
filename extension handling is deeply unfunny* for example.  khttpd most
likely has a problem with PPC (endian, etc).  Are you applying any other
patches that could conflict?
