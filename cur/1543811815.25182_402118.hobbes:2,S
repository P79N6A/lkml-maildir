The log is not supposed to say "Intel Corporation".
The controller hardware does not contain a manufacturer string anywhere,
so instead the driver makes up a name based on the current kernel version.  
(Likewise for the serial number; the driver makes up a name based on the
device's path.)
The name you see in the lspci output actually comes from the lspci program
itself, based on a code number embedded in the controller.
It has always been this way, and not just in -mm.
