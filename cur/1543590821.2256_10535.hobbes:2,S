Subject: [PATCH] missing return value from pci_xircom_fn() in drivers/char/serial.c

Hi,
I'm using the 2.4.4-ac8 kernel and found that the pci_xircom_fn() 
function in drivers/char/serial.c does not return a value even though it 
is defined as returning int. I took a look at the other initializer 
functions and they all return 0 (zero) on success, so I assumed that the 
correct return value for the pci_xircom_fn() function would also be 0. I 
don't know anything specific about what goes on in serial.c, so I may be 
wrong on this, but I do know that the function should either return some 
value or be declared as returning void, and since declaring it void 
would mess up the way it is used I guess it should return a value.
I have made a patch against 2.4.4-ac8 that makes the change, it is 
below. I guess someone more knowledgeable than me can probably see if 
this is correct. If this is completely bogus, then please just disregard 
this email.
