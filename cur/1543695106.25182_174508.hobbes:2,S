yea, it's simple enough to do.
/usr/src/linux-2.4.22/Makefile, line 94. Add "-march *" as you wish.
Now all that talent was wasted on this, all this time... for something so 
small, only that you want that simple fix made available for everyone. DIY 
like the rest of the people who are already building their own kernel(!!!)
look: every time i build, i have to uncomment "export install_path=/boot".
go figure out why i never asked them to change it for me, and stop biting the 
hand that feeds.

Don't be fooled... if you can help it.
