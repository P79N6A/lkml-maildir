As far as I know, I was the first to publicly complain about
the bug, first to Bitmover, (I was hitting it when using bk)
who then figured out that it was a kernel bug, hence the
long "1352 NUL bytes at end of page" thread.
I first noticed the bug around April 15, doing almost nightly
kernel updates and builds.  The bug was rather hard to hit
reliably though, so it could have been there for some time
earlier.
