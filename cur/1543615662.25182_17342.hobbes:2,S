That was my goal.

Well Lindent != indent.  The "indent" program can do formatting to the
wishes of the user.  However, "Lindent" is a wrapper script which is
trying to impose the will of Linus on other kernel programmers, and as
such "what the user wants to do" is of no concern.  If they don't want
to follow the "mandated" coding style, then they just don't use Lindent.
