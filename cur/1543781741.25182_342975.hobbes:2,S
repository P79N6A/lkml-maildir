Hi Chuck,
>   The softdog watchdog timer has a bug that can create an oops:
> 
>   1.  Load the module without the nowayout option.
>   2.  Open the driver and close it without writing 'V' before close.
>   3.  Unload the module.  The timer will continue to run...
>   4.  Oops happens when timer fires.

> Release it only when the device is closed and no timer is running.
> Tested on 2.6.13-rc6 using the soft_noboot option.  While the
> timer is running and the device is closed, the module use count
> stays at 1.  After the timer fires, it drops to 0.  Repeatedly

I'll add this to the watchdog tree.
Thanks,
Wim.
