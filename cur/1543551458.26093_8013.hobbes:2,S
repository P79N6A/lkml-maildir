Richard: I agree that the changes "shouldn't" be needed, but from
looking at the code, the alpha doesn't actually share the PGD entry for
vmalloc'ed memory at all.
The PGD is 1024 entries, and the last one is used by the self-mapping
stuff. But the VMALLOC area is NOT there - the self-mapping uses up one
complete PGD entry (it has to - it points to itself), and we don't set
up any other special vmalloc-entry that would be global from the start..
