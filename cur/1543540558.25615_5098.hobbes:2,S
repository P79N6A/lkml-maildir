You probably have a path statement in /etc/modules.conf (or
conf.modules) that says to scan /lib/modules/`uname -r`.  With the new
build symlink you end up scanning all of /usr/src/linux.  Remove any
path statements that point at the top level directory.  This is right
path[xxx]=/lib/modules/`uname -r`/xxx
This is wrong
path[xxx]=/lib/modules/`uname -r`
