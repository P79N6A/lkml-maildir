	Up to a certain point. If you reduce TCP to only one buffer, I
don't think it will work properly.
	I told you, the IrDA queues are totally under my control, so I
can fix them when I need, as opposed to PPP... What bugs me is that
each layer is having reasonably sized queues in itself, and that the
problem is just when we add those layers together...

	No, I didn't tried it because it was not obvious how to do it.

	Will try that.
	Actually, this is why I ask you in advance, so that we have
the time to think about it without rushing...

	Well, it's pretty obvious when watching tcpdump. You see all
the Tx clustered together and then nothing get Tx until the TCP window
opens again. In other word, you have a full TCP window queued in PPP
and IrDA.
	This is pretty bad for latency. Actually, you can verify that
by doing ping while a TCP connection is active, you will see huge
roundtrips.

	I believe that you won't drop packet, but just flow control
TCP (which in turn will flow control the application). At least, this
is the way it's happening within the IrDA stack.
