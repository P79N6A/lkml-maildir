../linux/net/socket.c handles most of the Socket API conversions
(bindings). This interfaces to lower-level code, most of which
is in ../linux/net/ipv4. 
Just `grep` through the kernel sources to follow the path. Most
of the names are similar. For instance:
./ipv4/tcp.c: * tcp_recvmsg has given to the user so far, it speeds up the
./ipv4/tcp.c:int tcp_recvmsg(struct sock *sk, struct msghdr *msg,
./ipv4/tcp_ipv4.c:	tcp_recvmsg,			/* recvmsg */
./netsyms.c:EXPORT_SYMBOL(tcp_recvmsg);
./ipv6/tcp_ipv6.c:	tcp_recvmsg,			/* recvmsg */
