This clearly means that it is a "dirty" shutdown, because it is replaying
the journal log.

It would be troublesome if you got the messages after a clean shutdown.
This might mean that reiserfs is not syncing some journal buffers to disk
when the root filesystem is remounted read-only.  Alternately, it may mean
that it is finding bogus transactions to replay in the journal (I don't
know how reiserfs determines whether the journal is clean or dirty).
It may also mean that your disk claims to have written data to disk, but
then only puts it in cache and you power off before in actually writes it.
Do you have APM/ACPI power off after shutdown?
Cheers, Andreas
