I need help with fork() on SPARC Linux.  I am trying to port my diet
libc to SPARC Linux but can't get fork() to work.  Even when I copy the
fork() code from glibc verbatim, the tasks have a corrupted stack frame.
I tried to strip the init code and it looks like I broke fork in the
process.  Does anyone have a pointer about fork() constraints that I
might have failed to notice?
Felix
PS: In case anyone is interested: the intel only version of diet libc is
