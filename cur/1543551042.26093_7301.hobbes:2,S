You have a point. How about specifying the complete path in the /proc file,
so that a special bit is set on the process when it is executed.
echo "/sbin/init" > /proc/sys/oom-ignore
User does an execvp("init", ...)
At this time, the user's path is searched for a match for "init".
The kernel determines "/sbin/init" is the correct path name and begins
to execute the program. It creates the process structure.
Then, before starting program execution, it compares the full path with the
list of entries in the /proc file. Seeing a match, it sets a bit (or a
variable kill-rate) on the process structure. OOM reads this process structure
in at kill-time and instantly determines which it should kill quickly or stay
away from. If none apply, default to standard algorithm.
