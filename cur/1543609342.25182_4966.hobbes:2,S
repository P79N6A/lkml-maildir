The implementation of module symbol versions is fundamentally broken.
The idea is good, to prevent incompatible modules being loaded into
your kernel and crashing it, but the implementation is built on several
assumptions that are not valid.  Total redesign coming up in kernel
2.5.  See the build 2.5 history package[1], expecially the html files.
Sometimes modversions work, more often then don't.
