How about
__usb_set_configuration - lockless version
usb_set_configuration - locked version
?
By the way, here is the list of routines that cause trouble for usbfs:
usb_probe_interface
usb_reset_device
usb_set_configuration
usb_unbind_interface
Both usb_set_configuration and usb_unbind_interface can be trivially
modified to have a __ form.  usb_probe_interface and usb_reset_device
require thought.
All the best,
Duncan.
