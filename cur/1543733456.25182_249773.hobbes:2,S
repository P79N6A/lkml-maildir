But this still solves only part of the problem.  A backup application
won't have any use for a copyfile syscall, it will need to be taught
about streams.

Definitely.

In that case I'd argue that:
    mount -t userfs -o driver=tarfs foo /tmp/foo
is a rather good kernel interface for plugins.  userfs (or something
based on userfs) is the plugin API and tarfs is a plugin. :-)
To make this efficient, well have to allow non-root users to perform
the mount syscall (with the limitation that they can only mount on top
of directories they own and that the mounts have the nosuid and nodev
flags set).
