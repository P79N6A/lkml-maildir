I know I can be a bit unclear some times, so feel free to be utterly
confused. :)
What I don't like is defines used for structure offsets where those
fields will be transformed into a normal C structure. I.e. the defines
will only be used once.
In this case, it's protocol opcodes, which are far more vital to have
readable. Currently we only use this in one place, but this will
probably grow. If I understand things correctly, switching to 4-bit and
8-bit bus also uses the SWITCH command?

A variant of this would be to do a macro. But this is fine as well.

Looks good.

Very nice. This is a lot less confusing when someone else will be
mucking about with the clock selection routines (e.g. adding SDIO support).
