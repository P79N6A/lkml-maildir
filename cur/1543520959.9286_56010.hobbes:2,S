Hi,
I received this message after participating to a meeting in Helsinki (of
Torvalds fame :-).
It occured to me that this could be good publicity for open source/free
software projetcs. The competiton is open to submissions from all over the
world.
Why not flood them a little bit, with good non-proprietary submissions since
they want to "offer you the chance to take part in a global sharing of
knowledge". Participation is free.
Just an idea
the site is:   www.challenge.stockholm.se
Bonne Annee

Dear Sir/Madam,
It has been brought to my attention that you were one of the participants at
the IST 99 in Helsinki and that you might be involved in IT projects of
excellence. I believe your projects would benefit from participating in the
Stockholm Challenge Award:
	1. It offers you the chance to take
	   part in a global sharing of
	   knowledge and brokering of
	   contacts.
	2. International marketing of the
	   Award attracts the attention of
	   media and venture capitalists and
	   paves the way to fruitful business
	   synergies and personal contacts.
I am working as Project Search Co-ordinator within the Stockholm Challenge
Award. As you probably already know, it is the successor to the Global
Bangemann Challenge, the international IT award that attracted widespread
international participation and recognition in 1997-1999.
The projects are invited to compete in seven different categories:
	Health & Quality of Life,
	New Economy, Education,
	Public Services & Democracy,
	Culture & Entertainment,
	Environment,
	Equal Access.
Make sure your project makes an impact! Technology is not the issue here. The
single most important criterion is the benefit that your project can bring to
individuals, society and the environment.
Entries are accepted until February 29th, 2000. Then the jury of 25
international experts will judge the projects and choose the winners and
finalist in each category. All competing projects in the Challenge will be
invited to participate in the Challenge Awards Ceremony in Stockholm in June
2000.
What does it cost to participate in the Challenge? - The participation is
free!
It would be very exciting to have your projects among the competing,
therefore I hope you will enter our web site at www.challenge.stockholm.se
and fill in the entry form as soon as possible.
If you have any questions I would be happy to answer them.
Best Regards,
Lars Malmsten
Project Search Co-ordinator
