This isn't dead, it's a placeholder ... the 53c700 can be wired either
LE or BE ... there's only one current BE user, and that's a parisc box
that has to be runtime switchable (the later integrated SCSI chip was
wired LE).  However, it was thought there would be ppc users for
unconditional BE drivers.
