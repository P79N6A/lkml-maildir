I'm pretty sure that on both amd64 and i386 the alignment has to be 
_before_ the address push from the call, though I cannot find any exact ABI 
specs at the moment. Experts please advise.
What do you get when running this slightly modified version of your test 
program? My patch would fix the alignment of Aligned16 here.
And for amd64, please also see arch/x86_64/kernel/signal.c where 8 is 
subtracted from the get_stack() result. Actually I wonder if other archs 
might be affected as well...

#include <stdio.h>

typedef struct { double x,y; } Aligned16 __attribute__((__aligned__(16)));
void *saved_esp;
void handler(int unused) {
         Aligned16 a;
         assert(__alignof(a) >= 16),
         saved_esp = (void *) &a;
}
int main()
{
         Aligned16 a;
         assert(__alignof(a) >= 16),
         printf("%p\n", &a);
         signal(SIGALRM, handler);
         alarm(1);
         pause();
         printf("%p\n", saved_esp);
         return 0;
}
