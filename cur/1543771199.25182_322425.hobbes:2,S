I see. I was totally unaware of that, many thanks for the information. 
Getting more memory bandwidth (to/from the PCI bus at least) will have 
to wait for my next system, I suppose.
Added EHCI maintainer to this one as well. If possible, this looks like 
a good candidate for a /proc or /sys knob?
Or maybe even starting out with a low querying frequency and dynamically 
adjusting it up (and down again!) with traffic? Probably not that. I'd 
like to have the knob though, so that I can have EHCI builtin and still 
tell the controller to take it easy (certainly after I've switched of 
the external HDD again, but on this system possibly also while in use).
Rene.
