Excellent catch.  This broken truncation thing....
And I don't know what the right solution should be for this scenario at
this point for 2.6.14....may be to actually look at the HUGEPTE
corresponding to the hugetlb faulting address or don't allow mmaps to
grow the hugetlb file bigger (except the first mmap).  I understand that
both of them don't sound too good...
Any suggestions.
