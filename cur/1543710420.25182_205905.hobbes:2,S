Just a question, but I remember from VMS a long time ago that
as part of the working set limits, the "free list" was used to keep
pages that could be freely used but could be put back into the working
set quite easily (a "fast" page fault). Could you keep track of the
swapped pages in a similar manner so you don't have to go to disk to
get these pages [or is this already being done]? You would pull them
back from the free list and avoid the disk I/O in the morning.
By the way - with 2.4.24 I see a similar behavior anyway [slow to get
going in the morning]. I believe it is due to our nightly backup walking
through the disks. If you could FIX the retention of sequentially read
disk blocks from the various caches - that would help a lot more in
my mind.
