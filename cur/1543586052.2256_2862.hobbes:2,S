Hi Ollie and List,
the recent changes (as of 2.4.3-pre8) completely broke the driver for the 
ALi5451 sound codec on Acer Travelmate 522TX. The driver has been somewhat 
flakey all the time, xmms or lamp worked most of the time, KDE's arts stuff 
never worked at all.
With 2.4.3-pre8 I cannot make it working at all. Once the module is loaded, 
the Log is filled with the following messages:
Mar 28 10:11:26 melap kernel: ali: AC97 CODEC read timed out.
Mar 28 10:11:45 melap last message repeated 482 times
This happens even if you don't try to play sound.
If you need more information or testing, please reply directly, as I'm not 
subscribed to the list.
best regards,
	Matthias
