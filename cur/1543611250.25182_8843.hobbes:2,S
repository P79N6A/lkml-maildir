Hi All,
I am facing a problem ( ???, maybe it works that way, but i really dont
know ) with regards to routing table behavior when using ifconfig on a
network interface.
1) netstat -nr      Shows my default gateway for network 0.0.0.0
2) ifconfig eth0 down
3) netstat -nr      No entry for the default gateway is shown (
understandable )
4) ifconfig eth0 up
After the the 4'th command, my interface is up and has it's IP address set
correctly. But .....
netstat -nr  does not show my default gateway for network 0.0.0.0 !!.
Pinging any IP outside of my subnet, results in "Network is unreachable"
error.
Is is meant to be that way ? or is there a problem here ?
I've tried it on kernel versions, 2.4.0, 2.4.5 & 2.4.15
FYI : This has been tried using both DHCP and Static IP.
Thanks in advance !
Regards,
Raj
