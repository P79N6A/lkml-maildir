So suspend took 15 second, and boot another 5 to read the image + 20
first time desktops are switched. ... ~40 second total.

Lets say 20 seconds suspend, plus 20 seconds resume, and no time
needed to switch the desktops. So it is ~40 seconds total, again ;-).

Of course, there are many ways to improve suspend. Some are easy, some
are hard, some can be merged, and some can not.

Should be easy, mergeable and possibly very effective. Relevant code
is in kernel/power/disk.c.

This would be fine if you can do it in userspace, but it is not going
to be so easy... ... actually, there's one entry in FAQ:
Q: After resuming, system is paging heavilly, leading to very bad
interactivity.
A: Try running
cat `cat /proc/[0-9]*/maps | grep / | sed 's:.* /:/:' | sort -u` >
/dev/null
after resume. swapoff -a; swapon -a may also be usefull.
...does that help for you?
Other possible ideas are:
* get suspend to RAM working if you want it *really* fast :-)
* compress the image. Needs to be done in userspace, so it needs
uswsusp to be merged, first. Patches for that are available. Should
speed it up about twice.
* and of course you can apply one very big patch and do all of the
above :-).
