This patch seems to mostly cure an oddity I've been seeing since
2.5.7x, or maybe very late 2.5.6x (I forget exactly when) where
running 'ps aux' or 'ls -l' in an xterm (and only xterm it seems; I've
tried rxvt and aterm) would more often than not result in a wallclock
run time of up to two seconds, instead of the usual tenth of a second
or so, with system and user time remaining constant.  If I keep
running 'ps aux' its output does start to become slow again, snapping
back to full speed after a few more runs.  Kind of an odd one.
