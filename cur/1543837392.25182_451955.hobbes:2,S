Right, so I managed to save logs as root, perm 600, and try and
 attach them as non-root and got not even a warning from either
 Firefox or the GMail interface. Tsk, tsk.
In any case, I now put them up here:

http://xoomer.alice.it/incident/messages-boot-battery.log
Sorry for the double message. Thanks,
