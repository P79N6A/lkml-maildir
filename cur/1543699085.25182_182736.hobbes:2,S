Hi all ! 
I'm upgrading my kernel to 2.6-test9
The option CONFIG_VIDEO_BT848=m in .config was available in 2.4, but I
can't find in  doing a "make gconfig" in the new  version. (This is to
manage my Pinnacle PCTV card)
However,  the files  related  to bttv  are  still there,  so, this  is
probably a trivially solvable problem.
