Just a sad little note that I've utterly lost the plot on the workqueue
changes.

I don't know which of these are good, bad or indifferent.
Furthermore I don't know which of these need to be tossed overboard if/when
we get around to using the task freezer for CPU hotplug synchronisation. 
Hopefully, a lot of them.  I don't really understand why we're continuing
to struggle with the existing approach before that question is settled.
