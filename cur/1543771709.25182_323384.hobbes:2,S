Thanx, now the module loads and (partly) works: I now have 500MHz and 650MHz
*only* as selection and I can switch between them both. But why only this two
options? If I enable speedstep in bios and force it, Linux reports 133MHz or
alike as CPU speed,which seems to be a more realistic lower limit, as I don't
think going to 500MHz will save me much.
Anyway, shoudl a quirk for this notebook be added somewhere? Do you need
additional infos for this, in case?
Is there a possibility to get the ACPI P-state driver going? Perhaps this
would give me a lower minimum clock. Or is the ACPI crew responsible for this
driver and should I ask them?
Cheers,
Prakash
