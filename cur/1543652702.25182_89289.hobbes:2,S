Is there an easy and plainless way to do this?  Are the LVM2 tools
backwards-compatible with the old LVM?  I've got important partitions on
LVM (/usr, /tmp, /var, /home) and I'd like to be able to switch back and
forth between 2.4 and 2.5 kernels without needing to keep around separate
copies of bootscripts and userland tools if possible.
Thanks!
Pat
