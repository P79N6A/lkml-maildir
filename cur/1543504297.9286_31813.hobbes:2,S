When composing that list, start by listing the entire CURRENT Packard
Bell range. Certainly all the models I've checked have 64 byte NVRAM
chips on them.
OTOH, some people are so keen to bloat the kernel that they'll put
just about any kind of rubbish in it - or are you implying that the
list of systems with various CMOS sizes is going to be small!!!

I'm still waiting to hear a valid reason why it might be bad...

Who said anything about using userspace?
Perhaps I can emphasise a point I believe I made in a previous post,
which is that the code snippet I wrote was to show the ALGORITHM that
I was suggesting be used. My quote from the sleep(3) manpage was to
point out the problems that need to be considered when doing anything
like that, as they are best summarised by the text therein.

Since you're the one proposing a userspace solution, you'd better
propose a way round that...if you see it as a problem, that is.

Both true and irrelevant.

Again, ditto.

Thanks for confirming my suspicion that suchlike chips do indeed
exist. That basically means that ANY auto-sizing algorithm needs to be
able to detect suchlike locations AFTER first detecting the chip's
address bus size.

Don't expect to see it get in the kernel then - Linus has already
stated that requiring parameters for something the kernel should be
able to auto-detect is a no-no, and that definately applies here, at
least unless somebody can come up with a sensible reason why it can't
be done.
OTOH, you might get away with inserting a new config option in one of
the various config.in scripts, and require the user to select the
correct RTC chip at compile time...
Best wishes from Riley.
