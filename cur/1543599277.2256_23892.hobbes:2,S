the userspace solution is simply `setterm -blank 0'
if you dont want setterm, I wager it just uses an ioctl to set the
appropriate option.
if you want to disable it permanently, take a look around
drivers/char/console.c
there is a
static int blankinterval = 10*60*HZ;
setting that to 0 should do the job.  you could take it further and rip
out some of the *blank* functions that you wont be needing, to make your
kernel smaller.
