This is insane.  You start with a lofty ideal involving "freedom", and
when you end up with a meaningless technicality (and in technical terms
a change for the worse) you consider it a victory?
Yes, I know that this is what happens in politics (look here, our laws
had an effect!), but I have more respect for you than to think you fall
for these kinds of games.  I do not wish to revise my opinion.
