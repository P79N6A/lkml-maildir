Reasonable.  As long as what the quirk is to avoid errata and
chipset specific issues I don't have a problem with it.
I figure the quirk should be a separate patch though.
My concern is that the general rule that always enabling HT MSI
mapping capabilities is reasonable.  Even if there are some
specific exceptions where we don't want to do that.
I want code that requires the smallest list of chipset
exceptions that we can make.
