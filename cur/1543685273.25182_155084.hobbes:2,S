I have been searching for a Howto (which is not outdated or Broken), on
how to mount a Netware 3.x or 4.x Filesystem on Linux.  I have 2.4.21
operating on Linux Mandrake 9.1.  I have installed ncpfs-2.2.2 and
desire to mount this filesystem to recover lost information for a
Non-Profit Organization.  I will post a HOWTO to the Slueth-kit List for
future reference.
As the Vender list is non-technical (more of a SCO Flamewar) nature
currently, and I am in need of this procedure to mount the Drive (I have
a 60 GB Disk on a USB Port with the Ghost Image installed on the drive -
full Inode replica).
Please reply back to me personally.  I was under the impression that
NWFS or NCPFS may be in the kernel and may support this functionality
that I need.
Best Regards.
