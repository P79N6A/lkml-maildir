Subject: Adaptec 1542 and kernel 2.2.11&12 not working?

I have a strnage problem and have spent a number of hours investigating
but haven't found a solution so I thought I'd try the list.
I have an old aha1542 card thats driving a sony dat drive, with all the
scsi options set for module and under kernel 2.2.9 everything works
fine as below:-
Configuring Adaptec (SCSI-ID 7) at IO:334, IRQ 11,DMA priority 5
Sep 11 17:21:14 bored kernel: scsi0 : Adaptec 1542
Sep 11 17:21:14 bored kernel: scsi : 1 host.
Sep 11 17:21:14 bored kernel:   Vendor: SONY      Model: SDT-5200      
 Rev:3.02
Sep 11 17:21:14 bored kernel:   Type:   Sequential-Access              
   ANSI 
SCSI revision: 02
However, if I use kernel 2.2.11 or 2.2.12 then it will not find the
scsi card at boot time and I cannot convince it to find it at all using
modprobe or insmod. Under both of these kernels if i try to use
modprobe I get:-
/sbin/modprobe aha1542.o
/lib/modules/2.2.12udma/scsi/aha1542.o: init_module: Device or resource
busy
I've tried adding parameters to lilo etc but this doesn't resolve what
ever is making the above error. However rebooting into kernel 2.2.9 the
scsi card loads as a module without a problem.
Any idea's would be appreciated I can't believe that the 1542 driver is
broken perhaps its just the module.
