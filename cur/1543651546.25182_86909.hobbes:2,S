Subject: 2.5.46: drivers/mtd/mtdblock.c won't compile -- misordered declaration

[This is a repost of my earlier message, since the problem doesn't seem
 to have been fixed in 2.5.46; could someone please look at this?
 I don't think it should be controversial...]
When I compile 2.5.45, I get the following errors:
     v850e-elf-gcc -Wp,-MD,drivers/mtd/.mtdblock.o.d -D__KERNEL__ -Iinclude -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -Wno-trigraphs -O2 -g -fomit-frame-pointer -fno-strict-aliasing -fno-common -mv850e -ffixed-r16 -mno-prolog-function -fno-builtin -D__linux__ -DUTS_SYSNAME=\"uClinux\" -nostdinc -iwithprefix include    -DKBUILD_BASENAME=mtdblock   -c -o drivers/mtd/mtdblock.o drivers/mtd/mtdblock.c
   drivers/mtd/mtdblock.c:398: parse error before `struct'
   drivers/mtd/mtdblock.c:399: `p' undeclared (first use in this function)
I fixed this locally as follows:
diff -ruN -X../cludes ../orig/linux-2.5.45-uc1/drivers/mtd/mtdblock.c drivers/mtd/mtdblock.c
