I don't see how the driver can write the sectors out of order, if
there is no TCQ (we're talking PATA) and every write must be committed
before it's acknowledged (write cache disabled).

Are you refuting the following assertion by Eric D. Mudama's, based on
your measurements?  In other words, are ATA's 32 TCQ slots enough to
eliminate the performance advantage of write cacheing?
