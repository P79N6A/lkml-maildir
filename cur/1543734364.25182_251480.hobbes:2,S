Looks like arithmetics on void* to me, so while removing a warning you
add a different one. Same for all other "fixes" later in the patch.
It doesn't look to me like you are fixing the code, only hiding the
warnings. I am not really confident you aren't breaking things while
doing this.
After a quick look at the code I'd say that the buffer-like parameters
involved should be declared as char* instead of void* in the first
place, which would effectively make all further casts unnecessary, and
still work exactly as before.
Thanks.
