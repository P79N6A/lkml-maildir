Hi
If you don't pay attention (yeah, I know) Its easy to write
kernel commond lines like 'console=ttyS0, console=.., etc'
The lack of a baud rate after the comma causes the kernel
to panic. The patch below will cause the kernel in treat the
non-existant baud rate specifier as the default without panicing.

     Think of the mess on the carpet. Sensible people do all their
     demon-summoning in the garage, which you can just hose down afterwards.
