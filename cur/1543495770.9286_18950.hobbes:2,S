In the 2.2.8 patch I just posted, I included the settimeofday fix
forwarded from Thorsten, and for SMP am not including the rpcc bits
in the [sg]ettimeofday results.
I think I'm back to, for SMP, using the rpcc only for lost interrupt
estimation.  Please look over what's there and send me any corrections
as necessary.
