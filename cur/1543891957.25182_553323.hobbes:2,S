Sorry. 
For modifications that crosscut the kernel it is not very practical to
look each time for the maintainer. We plan to send a patch that
replaces some calls to kmalloc/memset with kzalloc; do we have to split
it for each maintainer ?

I have launched my tool to detect such situations and I get this 
(in a diff-like format).

Ok. Do you have a preference on the format ?  a <file>:<line> format  ?
Is there a place that gathered all those implicit programming rules 
(that copy_from_user must not be called inside a spinlock, etc) so that
I can translate them in a script for our tool.
