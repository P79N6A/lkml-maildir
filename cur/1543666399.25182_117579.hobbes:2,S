Looks like a good guess to me.
I hadn't considered raid0/linear properly in that last change suite.
They don't have a thread so there is nothing to wake up.
There are two places where the wrong thing will happen:
  do_md_run where it also calls md_update_sb which doesn't
    hurt but isn't really needed (there is never any point
    updating the superblock metadata for raid0/linear).
  restart_array where we switch back to read/write and wakeup
    the thread to see if there is anything to do.
We either need this "if(!thread)" test inside md_wakeup_thread
or at those two call sites, in which case we can avoid md_update_sb
as well.
I send one to Linus later...
Thanks,
NeilBrown
