Hi all,
This is just a report back... I'm now running 2.2.14pre5 in the servers
that I was having problems with my Intel Etherxpress cards... I have also
changed the /proc/sys/vm/freepages to read as follows :
512     1024    1536
Since doing this the servers have stabilised and the load on them looks
better.
Thanks for all the help.
