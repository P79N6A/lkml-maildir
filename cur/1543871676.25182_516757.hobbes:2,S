Hi,
the fix "revert-optimize-and-simplify-get_cycles_sync" breaks the build:
  CC      arch/i386/kernel/asm-offsets.s
In file included from include/asm/timex.h:10,
                 from include/linux/timex.h:187,
                 from include/linux/sched.h:50,
                 from include/linux/utsname.h:35,
                 from include/asm/elf.h:12,
                 from include/linux/elf.h:7,
                 from include/linux/module.h:15,
                 from include/linux/crypto.h:21,
                 from arch/i386/kernel/asm-offsets.c:7:
include/asm/tsc.h: In function ‘get_cycles_sync’:
include/asm/tsc.h:45: warning: implicit declaration of 
function ‘alternative_io’
include/asm/tsc.h:46: error: called object ‘"=a"’ is not a function
include/asm/tsc.h:46: error: called object ‘"0"’ is not a function
include/asm/tsc.h:46: error: expected ‘)’ before ‘:’ token
make[1]: *** [arch/i386/kernel/asm-offsets.s] Error 1
make: *** [prepare0] Error 2
seems that alternative_io is only defined in the x86_64 case ...
what's the fix for the fix ?
Marc
