That code is going to have to be hacked anyway to use the new nodemask 
semantics, so it can easily add a flag to the set_mempolicy() call for the 
system-wide node numbering.  This then only requires a small addition to 
the documentation: use MPOL_F_MODE_SYS_WIDE for system-wide node numbering 
that isn't constrained to your cpuset.

That's a very legitimate concern, but those libraries will eventually need 
to be made to support this new extention anyway.  They will be modified 
just like we're modifying the kernel once people want to start using the 
different nodemask semantics.  As mempolicy modes become more popular, 
those libraries are going to start accepting custom mode flags to pass to 
their set_mempolicy() wrappers that will get OR'd with the mempolicy mode 
that is used.  It will be the natural progression of how mempolicies are 
supported in userspace.
