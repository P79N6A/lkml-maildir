Not to keep complaining, but I now have the following issue.  I running 
Fedora Cores  2.6.15-1.1826 kernel.  When I run dmesg I now see this:
Serial: 8250/16550 driver $Revision: 1.90 $ 2 ports, IRQ sharing enabled
serial8250: ttyS0 at I/O 0x3f8 (irq = 4) is a 16550A
00:06: ttyS0 at I/O 0x3f8 (irq = 4) is a 16550A
before 2.6.15 I saw
Serial: 8250/16550 driver $Revision: 1.90 $ 32 ports, IRQ sharing enabled
The serial driver now correctly reports that I have two serial ports instead 
of 32.  So shouldn't the patch register the minimum of 
CONFIG_SERIAL_8250_NR_UARTS and the number of serial ports detected by the 
serial driver?
Thanks,
Jason Dravet
