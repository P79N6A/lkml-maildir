    The bandwidth isn't a big problem, but the disk space is an issue.
    It does use more space to have this stuff under revision control and I 
    want to discuss that to see if it is acceptable to the community.  Here's
    an example: consider just the Historic kernels (0.1 .. 0.99.15, 38 in all).
        Size    What
        17M    All 38 tarballs gzipped
        11M    All 38 versions checked into BitKeeper
        1.8M    All 38 versions checked into BitKeeper and bzip2-ed
         .5M    The 0.99.15 tarball, gzipped
    The bad news is that I have a feeling that we might be looking at
    a 100-200MB repository for all the history going back to the beginning.
Hmm.

.5M is a really rough estimate for 1230386 bytes.

The actual patches (maybe very few prepatches included)
take somewhat over 200 MB uncompressed (context diffs).
Maybe this is about the size one should expect for a
source control system. It can represent the diffs more
compactly if they do not create new files, but there is
some more overhead.
A complete archive including lots of marginally related stuff
takes 1.3 GB here, less than 10% of a $350 disk.
