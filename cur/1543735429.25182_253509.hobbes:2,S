Maybe next evolutionary step is to put VFS layer directory on top of
RDMA -> PCI
Express/Latest serial IO, etc.
Similar to access file thru NFS/SMB just on a faster standardize
(RDMA) transport.
On the networking front, instead of TOE, it should be services
offload, similar to
web load balancer.     Offload service base on src/dest addr port
proto (tcp/udp).
NSO (Network service offload.)    - kind of like Apache's reverse proxy 
with URL rewrite, but maybe for other applications. 
Question for Leonid of S2io.com:  Your company has an interesting card.
I think it must have some kind of embedded CPU.  Care to tell us what kind 
of CPU are they?
