In the following code the parent (i.e. kernel) tries to set the child (i.e. task)
as owner for the socket. Does this work for you? It doesn't for me, for the
reason I described earlier.
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/socket.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <unistd.h>
int main (void) {
  int sockets[2], flags;
  pid_t pid;
  if (socketpair (AF_UNIX, SOCK_STREAM, 0, sockets)) {
    perror ("socketpair");
    return -1;
  }
  switch (pid = fork ()) {
    case -1:
      perror ("fork");
      return -1;
    case 0:
      pause ();
    default:
      if ((flags = fcntl (sockets[0], F_GETFL)) < 0) {
        perror ("fcntl, GETFL");
        return -1;
      }
      if (fcntl (sockets[0], F_SETFL, flags | O_NONBLOCK | O_ASYNC) < 0) {
        perror ("fcntl, SETFL");
        return -1;
      }
      if (fcntl (sockets[0], F_SETOWN, pid) < 0) {
        perror ("fcntl, SETOWN");
        return -1;
      }
  }
  return 0;
}
