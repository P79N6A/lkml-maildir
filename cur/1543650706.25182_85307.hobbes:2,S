So you're not really arguing against ACLs, you're complaining that
userspace is broken when there's shared write access.  That's fine,
userspace should be fixed, inclusion of ACLs into the kernel shouldn't
be denied because of this.  ACLs should be optional, of course, and if
you want them some really noisy warnings about the problems of shared
writeable area with current userspace tools.  Of course, that same
warning should probably be included in 'groupadd'.
