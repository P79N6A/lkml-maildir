Yes, there are reasons to NOT make something a tunable:
o increases system complexity (admin)
o increases the amount of documentation (learning curve)
o increases test matrix/cost (devel/support cost)
o generally hurts performance (var vs a constant of the same value)
Any reason to make something a tunable has to compensate
for the above drawbacks. An answer to Roland's question
is a reasonable prerequisite if someone wants add a tunable.
IB doesn't have the much in /sys/class/infiniband* or module parameters
and I think that's a Good Thing.
