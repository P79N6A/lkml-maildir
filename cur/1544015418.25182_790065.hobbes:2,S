Subject: [PATCH -tip 2/2] kernel/sched.c: forward declaration for 'double_rq_lock' missing
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2009/1/11/52

Impact: compile error eliminated
Added 'double_rq_lock' forward declaration, allowing double_rq_lock
to be used in _double_lock_balance().
