Actually, I believe that the LGPL allows for static linking as well. As
long as you only interact with the library through the defined API, it
is OK.
>From the LGPL preamble:
 The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
be combined with the library in order to run.
Point number 5 of TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION:
 5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
So, I would say that the LGPL _does_ allow statically linked to non GPL
work.
