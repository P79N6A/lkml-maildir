Ok, I'll try again ;-)  People have been seeing null bytes in data files on
reiserfs.  They see this without seeing any other corruption of any kind,
and they only see it on files of very specific sizes.  They see this
without crashing, and without hard drive suspend kicking in.  They see it
on scsi and ide, on servers and laptops.
Elevator bugs and general driver bugs could certainly cause nulls in data
files.  But they would also cause other corruptions and probably would not
be selective enough to pick files that happen to have the same range in
size that reiserfs packs tails on.
In other words, updating to 2.4.2pre2 or your favorite ac series kernel is
probably a good plan.  It won't fix this bug ;-)
Perhaps I haven't seen it yet because I've also been testing code that does
direct->indirect conversions slightly differently, I'll try again on a pure
kernel.
