They already show up underneath of the PCI bus.  The issue is that there 
are two separate 'struct device's for each virtio device.  There's the 
PCI device (that's part of the pci_dev structure) and then there's the 
virtio_device one.  I thought that setting the dev.parent of the 
virtio_device struct device would result in having two separate entries 
under the PCI bus directory which would be pretty confusing :-)
