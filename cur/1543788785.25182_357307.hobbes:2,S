Why programming errors?  It could be faulty memory or other corruption, 
perhaps even caused by a different driver altogether (e.g. I found a bug 
in ntfs last week which caused it to memset() to zero a random location in 
memory of a random size and it caused a lot of strange effects like my 
shell suddenly exiting and me being left on the login prompt...).  Also it 
could be that the function one day changes and it can return NULL.  It is 
far safer to do checking than to make assumptions about not being able to 
return NULL.

What do you mean corrupt filesystem?  If a filesystem is written so badly 
that it will cause corruption when a NULL is returned somewhere, I 
certainly don't want to have anything to do with it.
Going BUG() is generally a bad thing if the error can be recovered from.  
Certainly all my code attempts to recover from all error conditions it can 
possibly encounter.
I would much rather see NULL and then handle the error gracefully with an 
error message than go BUG().  You can then still umount and remove the fs 
module and everything works fine (you may need an fsck you may not depends 
on how good your error handling is).  If you do a BUG() you are guaranteed 
to cause corruption...  I only use BUG() when something really cannot 
happen unless there is a bug in which case I want to know it...
Best regards,
