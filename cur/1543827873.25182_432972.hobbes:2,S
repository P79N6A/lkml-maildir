Hi,
I haven't been following this closely, so I apologise if I'm out of
my depth. It would be a useful add-on to be able to use this
interface to force something _out_ of the page cache also. For
example, for performance tests, or selectively ditching pages before
software suspending.
I realise it'd probably be much more work and more intrusive than
the current patch - though perhaps just considering the possibility
of this in the interface, so that the interface could be reused if
the feature was added later?
Kind regards,
Bernard.
