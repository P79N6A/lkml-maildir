I will start picking stuff up now I'm back and catching up on email
(I've been away for a week). I'm not however interested in kexec or ltt
or a lot of the other large stuff so don't bother resending me that kind
of thing.
I really want to collect up bug fixes/compile fixes/driver updates and
small but ready to merge stuff like the console updates if James Simmons
is paying attention.
