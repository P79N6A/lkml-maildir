Nah, search the archives for 'sucker tree' -- was much worse before 
we have the stable bugfix patchlets in between the main kernel 
releases, there was never going to be a 2.6.X.Y to 2.6.X+1 patch as 
mainstream kernel development may fix issues entirely differently.
Kernel development is an ongoing process, the stable trees are 
temporary branches outside of (or beside) mainstream development, 
that easier for you?
