  I don't have a strong opinion on this but I like the current state
slightly more. I know there's a mess that VFSv0 = quota_v2. But
currently it's at least in the state that what users (admins) see is
VFSv0 and v2 appears only in the name of kernel config options and in
the identifiers in the code. Changing VFSv0 to "v2" in kernel is no
problem but quota-tools use VFSv0 too and it's also used as an
identifier of a quota format in the options of quota tools (hence
renaming is higly unpleasant for admins). So I'm not sure that renaming
config options in kernel doesn't make things even more messy.
