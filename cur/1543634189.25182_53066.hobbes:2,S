Garet,
You are wasting electons, the interface is gone and the API to the
transport is wrecked.  I will need to compose a loadable module to renable
the support.  Clearly 2.5/2.6 is not friendly with the needs of the
industry and it will never be at this rate.
In the end, I will end up writing a closed ATA binary driver for sale as a
replacement.  I have had several requests to consider the option.  As much
as I do not like the idea, it is less offensive than the current
direction.

This has been working well, thanks to Andre's patch that gave us taskfile access through the ioctl API. We were counting on it to be a permanent part of the 2.5/2.6 kernel, since there is a lot of hardware in the field using these apps.
