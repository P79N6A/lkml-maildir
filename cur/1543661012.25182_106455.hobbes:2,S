Probably harmless, but if you figure it out please send me a patch.
Basically the steps are:
- find out which ioctl it is.
- check its arguments. if the arguments are 64bit clean (see
http://www.firstfloor.org/~andi/writing-ioctl32
 for a definition) you just
add it as COMPATIBLE_IOCTL to arch/x86_64/ia32/ia32_ioctl.c
If not you have to write a conversion handler, also following the tutorial
in writing-ioctl32.

It works with the SuSE 32bit gdb/userland.
I think RedHat has a different libpthread. I don't have a RedHat userland,
so someone else will have to debug it.

I put your previous patch already into CVS, but that was after the 
last Marcelo sync.
