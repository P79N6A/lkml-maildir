I'm trying to keep it from getting too complicated.

There are advantages to having a larger base page size, such as
increased TLB reach.  I'm specifically targetting kernels built with
CONFIG_PPC_64K_PAGES, but other architectures could benefit.

I don't see page_cache_size() in linux-2.6.21-rc6-mm1.  Is there
something newer?
Anyway, my patches are at a proof-of-concept stage.  I look forward to
more discussion when I post the patch set.
Thanks,
