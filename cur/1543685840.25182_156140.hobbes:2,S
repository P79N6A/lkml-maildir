Hi:
   (I filled a bug report to 
http://bugme.osdl.org
 a couple of days ago, and
   it seems the automated email to linux-kernel on each new bug filed
   doesn't work anymore, so here it is the problem explained.)
[1.] One line summary of the problem:    
"rmmod floppy" hangs the box if done shortly after "modprobe floppy" and
no floppy in the drive
[2.] Full description of the problem/report:
Doing some tests to see why ide-cd doesn't autoload while floppy does, I
came across this problem. I was basically doing the following:
mount /dev/fd0 /floppy ; sleep 1 ; rmmod floppy
And most of the times, shortly after (a couple of seconds) the last command 
I get a kernel panic on the console: no networking, no disk access, just
SysRq to reboot the box, but nothing else. The following panic message
was copied by hand from the screen maybe there is something missing,
becasue resolutino was 80x25 and nVIDIA framebuffer still doesn't work
completely ok.
Badness in device_release at drivers/base/core.c:84

 <0> kernel panic: Fatal exception in interrupt
In interrupt handler - not syncing
I tried the same sequence of commands with ACPI disabled in the BIOS,
with the same results (but slightly different stack trace, of course).
[3.] Keywords:
2.6.0-test2-mm2 floppy module rmmod panic kernel panic
[4.] Kernel version:
Linux version 2.6.0-test2-mm2 (jdomingo@dardhal) (gcc version 3.2.3 20030415 (Debian prerelease)) #2 jue jul 31 20:45:59 CEST 2003
[5.] Output of Oops.. message
See above [2.]
[6.] A small shell script or example program which triggers the problem
See above [2.]
[7.] Environment
Debian Linux Sid, kernel version 2.6.0-test2-mm2 compiled with gcc 3.2.3, 
libc 2.3.1, module-init-tools 0.9.13-pre-1. Kernel compiled with ACPI
support, but not modular. Box booted in "minimal mode" (linux
init=/bin/bash) to avoid messing things up.
Hope it helps.
