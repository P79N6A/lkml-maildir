Hi,
             I have compiled a 2.6.10 on FC3.It
compiled successfully .But When i boot to this option
,it gives me warning 
        Warning: unable to open an initial console
I know this is due to something genromfs . I also read
about romfs in documentation .
In my .config file romfs type is y (built in ).
What should i do ?
                    Waiting for reply .
                    Thanks in advance .
