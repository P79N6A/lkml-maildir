Andrew Morton has either adapted, rewritten, or both the code I'd
devised for this vs. 2.4.x-based rmap involving the pagemap_lru_lock,
and that code is in 2.5.3x-mm. Momchil Velikov also originally devised
the ratcache early in 2.5.x. So this is a bit beyond alpha, and
probably needs Andrew Morton's, Momchil Velikov's, and Dave Hansen's
names on it, possibly even removing mine.
Thanks,
Bill
