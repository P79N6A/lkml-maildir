Hi,
The first issue is a bug, I'll send a patch in a few minutes.
The second one is not a bug. kfree on line 477 is freeing the
strucuture allocated by v9fs_t_walk. v9fs_t_create call overwrites
fcall (after the call it is either NULL or points to another memory
area) so the kfree on line 294 (or line 301 in case of error) don't do
double-free.
There is another bug in the second function though. If v9fs_get_idpool
fails, the execution goes to error label and kfree is called on the
uninitialized fcall. I'll include a fix of this bug too.
Thanks,
    Lucho
