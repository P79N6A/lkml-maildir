Hm. 11000 is a bash, so it forked some process. Just wanted to note,
that there are _no_ Zombies around, but this wait()ing bash.

... following more processes with 0.0% CPU.
As you can see, it's impossible to generate a load of 10.59 with these
few processes running. There are two processes running full time.
FahCore_78.exe at nice 19 and tvtime never uses more then 15% CPU.
But as the load grows, the system is usable as with load 0.0.
And it really should be usable with 76.0% nice. ;) No problem here.
This really high load is not correct.
