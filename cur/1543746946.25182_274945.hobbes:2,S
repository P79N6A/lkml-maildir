I will soon. Although I have to apply this patch also, more than one
person use my machine at once. My 2 and a half year old son would be
angry without his cartoons. ;-)
In the meantime it turned out that downing eth1 did not solve this
problem. The r8169 stopped spitting its messages but I still had one
hda: dma_timer_expiry: dma status == 0x24
hda: DMA interrupt recovery
hda: lost interrupt
in dmesg.
