in an earlier thread i suggested to not scan kernel stacks at all, but 
to delay the registration of new blocks to return-from-syscall time (via 
having a per-task list of newly allocated but not yet registered 
blocks). That way we dont get false positives for stuff that is on the 
kernel stack temporarily and then freed, and we correctly register newly 
allocated blocks as well.
