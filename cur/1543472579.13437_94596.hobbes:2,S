Heidy heidy ho!
The spice girls now include oregano, parsley, orange peel, basil, and
three other herbs and spices. This is an upgrade from the previous
scary and infant spices of unknown composition.
This secret blend of herbs and spices is included with all versions of
Linux 2.1.131. This hot and spicy version of the Linux kernel is
guaranteed to stimulate your technological tastebuds. Use of PGP is
encouraged to ensure that this secret blend of spices remains a
secret. 
Scheduled for release next month are spiced and chickend. spiced is
designed to deliver spices on demand. chickend delivers chicken on
demand. Together they deliver a dish which can be sold for excessive
prices. 
Sincerely,
Colonel Flanders
