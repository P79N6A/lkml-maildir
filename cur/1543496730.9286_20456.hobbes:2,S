    Certainly I would not want to discourage anyone from writting code that
they find interesting.  From that standpoint if we have 2 journaling
filesystems or 15 journaling filesystems then so much the better.
    However, from the standpoint of improving Linux, there are a lot of things
that need to be done.  If whoever was going to write ext3 has other projects
they want to work on too, then its certainly better not to duplicate work.
Just my 2 cents,
Jim
