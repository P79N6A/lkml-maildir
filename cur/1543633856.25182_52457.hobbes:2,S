Runtime is much more interesting to me.  However, if you are keeping
enough information to do the accounting as you suggest, then it would
be trivial to make it available incrementally over the life of the
socket.
Billing is not the only interesting aspect of this.  It is also good for
any program trying to dynamically tune or understand the lower-level
characteristics of a particular routing path or interface.
