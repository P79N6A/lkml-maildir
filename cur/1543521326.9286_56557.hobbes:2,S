Hi there,
while using PPP/dial-on-demand together with IP_MASQ, I was annoyed by the
link being established with a local address different from the one kept in
the masquerading entry (which matched the previous link address). So I've
implemented the IP_MASQ_CMD_FLUSH command for the target IP_MASQ_TARGET_CORE.
This allows to quickly flush all masquerading entries.
Here is the patch against 2.2.14. It slightly modifies net/ipv4/ip_masq.c and
adds an example program in Documentation/networking/ip_masq. The scripts ip-up
and ip-down on my firewall box now call it and I now have a true dial-on-demand.
It works correctly, and I'm sending this mail using it.
For those who can't extract the patch from this mail, it's available at :

Happy dialing :-)
