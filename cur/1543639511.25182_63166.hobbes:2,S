There are manual pages on the concepts and xattr syscalls and kernel as well 
as user space code at <
http://acl.bestbits.at/>,
 and a CVS repository at 
<
http://oss.sgi.com/projects/xfs/>.
 For implementing the kernel code please 
take a look at the ext2/ext3 patches. If you have further questions, the 
appropriate forum would be the acl-devel@bestbits.at mailing list, 
<
http://acl.bestbits.at/mailman/listinfo/acl-devel/>,
 and also the 
<linux-fsdevel@vger.kernel.org> list.
Regards,
Andreas.
