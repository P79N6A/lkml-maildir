We don't, but we can, and we should.  "bk relink tree1 tree2" seems like 
the right interface.
Right now we aren't too worried about the disk space, the data is sitting 
on a pair of 40GB drives and we're running the trees in gzip mode, so they
are 75MB each.  But yes, it's a good idea, we should do it, and probably
should figure out some way to make it automatic.  I'll add it to the
(ever growing) list, thanks.
