Which problems do you have at runtime? Do all ide disk work?
I.e. do you have problems with ide, or is the reporting wrong?
Legacy ide always uses irq 14 and 15, it could be overeager error 
detection that notices that unused fields in the pci configuration data 
contain odd values.
Could you add lspci -vxxx -s 00:11.1?
