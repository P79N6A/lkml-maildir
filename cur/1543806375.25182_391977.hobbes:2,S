Great advice, however, the EFF are not experts in IP law.  I would 
suggest a good firm in Palo Alto, like Rosati, Goodrich and Sonsini, 
they are experts
in corporate IP law and Corporate law in general.  They would know all 
the loopholes people and companies are likely to use.  Stay away from these
freebie Law Groups who are more likely to kiss your butt and tell you 
waht you want to hear rather than what you NEED to hear. 
OSDL should pick up the tab.  It will cost around 30K for a good 
analysis from them.
