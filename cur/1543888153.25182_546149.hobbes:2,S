Hello All
           I tried to execute a program which creates 8152 process.(
i=0; while( i<14) i++ fork(); )  with ulimit 8200. This program
created 8152 processes and then stopped and came back to command
prompt. this proves that my machine do have sufficient resources to
create 8000 processes.
           I found one more interesting thing on the same machine
having FC6 distribution and Linux Kernel 2.6.18. i have set "ulimit -u
100". after setting this limit i tried to execute fork bombing program
with guest account. after executing it
expected result:-  guest uesr should not able to fork another single
process when it reaches to 100 processes count.
actual result :-  kernel allow me to create another processes without
giving error. due to this i tried to execute same fork bombing program
on another terminal with guest account and this fork bombing attack
killed the box completely and machine needed reboot.
will any please tell me why this is so?
Regards
Anand
