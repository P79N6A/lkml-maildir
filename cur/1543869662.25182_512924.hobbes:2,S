The reason I noticed these issues was that I was studying the signal
delivery code for a virtualisation project, and these discrepancies
were immediately obvious just from reading the code.
I'm definitely not using that signal number translation feature; heck
I didn't even know it existed until a few days ago.
If it's dead as you say then it really ought to be removed. It currently
seems to make a mess in every arch's signal delivery code.
