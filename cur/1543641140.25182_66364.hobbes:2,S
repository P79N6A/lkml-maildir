Well we wouldn't want to leave tons of free pages on the LRU - the
VM would needlessly reclaim pagecache before finding the free pages.  And
higher-order page allocations could suffer.
If we go for explicit lru removal in truncate and zap_pte_range
then this approach may be best.  Still thinking about it.
