Ahh.. overloading a failure code. OK, I can deal with that...

From the .config ("turn them all on and see what sticks" here)
CONFIG_IRDA=m
#
# IrDA protocols
#
CONFIG_IRLAN=m
CONFIG_IRNET=m
CONFIG_IRCOMM=m
CONFIG_IRDA_ULTRA=y

# IrDA options

CONFIG_IRDA_CACHE_LAST_LSAP=y
CONFIG_IRDA_FAST_RR=y

CONFIG_IRTTY_SIR=m
On my doesn't-complain -rc2-mm1 kernel:
% lsmod | grep -i ir
irnet                  21409  0 
ppp_generic            22177  1 irnet
irtty_sir               8321  0 
sir_dev                14473  1 irtty_sir
ircomm_tty             35345  0 
ircomm                 20425  1 ircomm_tty
irda                  188973  5 irnet,irtty_sir,sir_dev,ircomm_tty,ircomm
crc_ccitt               2817  1 irda
My guess is that irda fails to insmod because of the sysctl errors, so when
the other ir* modules try to load, they come up empty on symbols that irda
provides.
