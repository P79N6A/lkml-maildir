 Hi,
I am constantly having problems with my G550 matrox card.
I'm trying to get same video mode in framebuffer as in XFree.
I'm using 1280x1024x16 in XFree but this mode in fb don't work.
My LCD monitor turns black and slowly change into all white.
There is some very bright white area in lower right corner of monitor.
% dmesg | grep -i matrox
