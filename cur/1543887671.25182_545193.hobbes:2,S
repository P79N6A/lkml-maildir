I have introduced an ioproc_update_page_locked() call for this and
related paths, and updated the kernel patches; this avoids a race
condition I was seeing in multi-threaded processes taking concurrent
page faults under the split locks. The split lock is now acquired
once, and the changes allowed me to do other some optimisations on
this path too.

The split locks were used previously via pte_offset_map_lock(), so
this race wasn't possible previously.

This does make most sense and is now the case, although atomiticity
wasn't a problem, since it's fine to use ioproc_update_page/range()
speculatively.
