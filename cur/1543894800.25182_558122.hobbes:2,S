Hi,
This is the latest release of the previously called "Conditional Calls"
infrastructure, turned into a static variable synchronized with the load
immediate instructions whenever it is changed. Important changes were made
following the advice received (more details in the specific changelogs). Please
feel free to have a look at this improved version.
It applies at the end of the 2.6.22-rc4-mm2 patch series.
Mathieu
