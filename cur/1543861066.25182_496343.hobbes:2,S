This is the same bug as:
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=6449
Which should be "fixed" since 2.6.17 (and late 2.6.16.y), because the
SMBus unhiding quirk which this laptop needs was disabled when the
kernel is built with suspend support. The real fix was provided by Alan
Cox and will be in 2.6.20 if anyone could try the RCs and report.
So the blacklisting should no longer be necessary for any version of
Ubuntu which comes with a kernel >= 2.6.16.18.
