Maybe this could be off-by-default behavior that can be enabled with a
special mmap flag or madvise, or something similar.  It seems that apps
don't want to get SIGBUS for low memory.  But, if they have _asked_ for
it, perhaps they'd be a bit more willing.
(BTW, I fixed the bogus linux-mm cc, finally ;)
