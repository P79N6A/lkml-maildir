How well would _this_ notion of an operating point scale up?
I have this feeling that it's maybe better attuned to "scale down"
sorts of problems (maybe cell phones) than to a big NUMA box.  I can
see how a batch scheduled server might want to fire up only enough
components to run the next simulation, but I wonder if maybe systems
dynamically managing lots of resources might not be better off with
some other model ... where userspace makes higher level decisions,
and the kernel is adaptive within a potentially big solution space.
(Likewise, maybe some of the smaller systems would too.)
Also, I suspect everyone would be happier if cpufreq were left
responsible for the CPU-specific parts of an operating point.
That could mean system-specific hooks, e.g. to rule out certain
voltages based on available power or what devices are running.
Unfortunately, examples of non-CPUfreq part of an operating point
may be tricky to come by on desktop systems.

Taking a more extreme position or two:
  - Why have any parsing at all?  It's opaque data; so insist that
    the kernel just get raw bytes.  That's the traditional solution,
    not having the kernel parse arrays of integers.
  - Why try to standardize a data-based abstraction at all?  Surely
    it'd be easier to use modprobe, and have it register operating
    points that include not just the data, but its interpretation.
  - If those numbers are needed, having single-valued sysfs attributes
    (maybe /sys/power/runstate/policy_name/XXX) would be preferable
    to relying on getting position right within a multivalued input.
What I've had in mind is that "modprobe" would register some code
implementing one or more named runtime policies.  Now one way to use
such code would be to equate "policy" and "operating point"; a static
mapping, as I think I see Todd suggesting, but compiled.  (Or maybe
tuned using individual sysfs attributes.)
But another way would be to have that code pick some operating point
that matches various constraints fed in from userspace ... maybe from
sysfs attribute files managed by that code.  It could use all sorts
of kernel APIs while choosing the point, and would clearly need to
use them in order to actually _set_ some new point.
It's easier for me to see how "echo policy_name > /sys/power/runtime"
would scale up and down (given pluggable policy_name components!)
than "echo 0 35 98 141 66 -3 0x7efc0 > /sys/power/foo" would.

Sysfs already has all that infrastructure, if you adopt the policy
that such system-specific constraints show up in system-specific
attributes somewhere ... matching the system-specific knowledge that's
used to interpret them.  That'd also be less error prone than "whoops,
there wasn't supposed to be a space between 35 and 98" or "darn, I
switched the 141 and 66 around again".
