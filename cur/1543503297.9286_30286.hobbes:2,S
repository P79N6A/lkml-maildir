I once noticed that gprof had such a feature, one of it's outputs was an
ordered list of functions that you pass to the linker which then clustered
them together.
If I remember the general technique of reordering procedures to improve
load time has been called 'page tuning' because the idea is to get
commonly used functions in the same page of memory. It also has the happy
benifit of reducing real ram usage for common cases.
