...and she still can't stop grinning. 
Basically I've tracked down the poweroffs on my system using the stock
kernel. I'm now running what is basically a slightly reduced config
whose only real difference with the crashing one (that I build along the
way - 20 kernels in total) was the i2c code.
The majorly big email I sent describing exactly what happens is here:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=104860726612212&w=2
I2C components that were compiled in:
-CONFIG_I2C=y
-CONFIG_I2C_CHARDEV=y
-CONFIG_I2C_PIIX4=y
-CONFIG_I2C_PROC=y
-CONFIG_SENSORS_ADM1021=y
Please help. I like knowing what temp my cpu is at. :)
