Daniel's original patch MADE it optional. Its just that the code is
apparently more complex looking that way, so its cleaner to do what Ingo
did.

Then this will help you.

We aim to make IRQ latencies deterministic. This affects preemption
latency in a positive way. 
Anywhere in the kernel that IRQs are disabled, preemption is impossible.
(you can't interrupt the CPU when irqs are disabled)
But you said you are worried about overhead. You have to incur overhead
to make task response deterministic.
Are you sure you are not just trying to make it FAST?
But then - even if you do, this is still in your interest.
Let's wait for some numbers.

The following two are the same. The former is an earlier implementation,
and has been superseded by the latter. The former is NLA.
