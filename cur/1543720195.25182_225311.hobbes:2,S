Subject: [PATCH] Proposed change to Documentation/CodingStyle regarding newline at end of file
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Having found a few files in the source that did not end in a newline
(patches for those submitted earlier) I thought it might be good to add a
small bit to Documentation/CodingStyle telling people to please ensure
their files end in newline.
Here's a patch with the Change I propose, comments are welcome. Btw, I
could not find any maintainer listed for this document, so I just send
this to linux-kernel - if someone specific should be send the patch please
inform me.
