First let me apologize for posting without being on the
list.  Please cc me on responses.  I did search archive
before posting...
I need to know if support for KNI has propagated into
supported kernels.  In particular, Redhat kernels.  I need
this on my workstation, but can't afford to get out on the
hairy edge where MIS won't support me.
The basic features I'm interested in are correct context
switching (fxsave/fxrstor) and dispatching KNI exceptions
(vector 19) back to the user application.
