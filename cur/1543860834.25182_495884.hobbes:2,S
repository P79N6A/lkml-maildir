Hi Florin,
I have not seen any similar bugreports, but it seems that you are able to 
reproduce the problem reliably to some extent.
Do you think that you could try to narrow down whether the HID core 
patches that went to 2.6.20-rc1 might possibly be causing your problem?
The easiest way might probably be just reverting the following commits and 
see if you can still reproduce the problems. It would be nice if you could 
try, so that we know whether it is caused by HID core, or any other 
post-2.6.19 USB/input changes.

They should be revertible without conflict in this order.
Thanks,
