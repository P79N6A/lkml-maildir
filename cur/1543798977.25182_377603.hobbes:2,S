Cleanups are always good, I am open to any suggestions.

Thanks, but it was NOT changed from my last attempt. Just rediff.

I don't do that? Could you clarify?

I don't mind to rename, probably plist_head is better. I'd like to know
Ingo's opinion first.

For example?

Agreed, I already thought it makes sense to add plist_add_prio() helper.
Note that ->prio is set directly mostly right before plist_add() call.

plist_empty(head) means this list empty. plist_unhashed(node) means
this node is not on list.

Again, this patch is unchanged. I don't mind to rename, but recall
that it was sent before the current implementation become functional.
And honestly I don't like 'sp_node', this name is misleading, and
reflects first buggy implementation. It should be called 'all_nodes'
or something like this.
