Yes, I know the presented approach wasn't too generic.
How about doing it in a device-like model? There would be different
providers for e.g. AES encryption and the kernel would autoload one of
them depending on say modprobe.conf settings. This way we'd have AES
implemented in software in one module and the PadLock AES in another.
By default the software versions would be used, but the user could choose
the one specific for their hardware.
Comments?
And how about the first patch for crypto/cipher.c? It extends the
interface for not only encryption/decryption of one block for given
algorithms, but also provides a way to do the transform of the whole
buffer in a given mode (ECB, CBC, ...). Is this acceptable in this form?
Should I do something similar for hash and compress functions to stay
consistent?
