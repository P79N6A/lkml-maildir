I'm sure that's what the driver writers had in mind.  ;-)
And I think we probably have a great shot at getting Intel, Microsoft, 
HP, et al.. to add a feature for Linux to one of the ACPI table 
specifications that define an "unused port for delay purposes" field in 
the ACPI 4.0 spec, and retrofit it into PC/104 machine BIOSes.  At least 
Microsoft doesn't have a patent on using port 80 for delay purposes. :-)
