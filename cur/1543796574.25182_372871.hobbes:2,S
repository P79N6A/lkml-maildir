If you want a userspace governor to change the CPU speed, you need to
export the value to userland. There are several papers showing[1] that
such speed scheduling should be done by power-aware applications which
need to tell the OS what speed they require to run to meet their
processing needs.
I agree that /proc/cpuinfo shouldn't be used (though it is a nice
interface for humans to read about the CPU speed), but the current
sysfs interface should do.
