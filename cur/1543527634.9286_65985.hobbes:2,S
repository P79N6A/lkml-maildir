Hello,
	Anybody works here on debuggers ? Any body _worked_/_works_ on
core dumps ?
Can somebody point me to sueful information regarding coredumps ?
/usr/src/linux/asm-i386/user.h is not sufficient.
Am currently trying to parse through fs/binfmt_elf.c
Where can I find exact documentations about ptrace. man is definitely
incomplete.
What are the reasons the function access_ok (VERIFY_WRITE,unsigned long
* d) can return FALSE if I am passing a temporary variable to d (which I
assume to be in user space.
Regards
shourya
