By allowing tools to read the rom from the pci device itself, instead of
whichever device's rom happens to be at 0xC0000.  libx86emul allows you
to define routines that it uses for memory access, so you can copy the
ROM out to normal memory, and map that memory to the appropriate address
that way.  X and vbetool both already have to do this, but without
copying the firmware image, to do DDC probing on x86_64.

I'm actually talking about vbetool here, though X could use these
methods.  Indeed, libx86emul comes from X itself.
