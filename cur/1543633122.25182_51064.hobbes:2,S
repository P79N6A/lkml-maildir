Subject: [PATCH] IDE oops with generic ide driver

Hi,
In driver/ide/ide.c file, at function ide_revalidate_disk,
If there is no IDE-disk particular driver,
DRIVER(drive) is NULL, which means it is generic IDE driver.
The 2.4.x ide.c code was not written to check if it is NULL or not.
That's the problem. All other part is checked.
