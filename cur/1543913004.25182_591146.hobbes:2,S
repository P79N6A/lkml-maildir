Hi,
the problem I am seeing with __weak functions is that as far as I can see, 
gcc 4.1.0 optimizes the empty __weak function away with -O2, so it is not 
later properly overridden by the other non-weak function, as the callsite 
already doesn't have the corresponding call. (when I stick a printk() into 
the __weak function, everything works fine - it is not optimized away and 
non-weak version of the function gets called).
I persume this is a bug in gcc (4.1.1 doesn't seem to expose this 
behavior). I will look at it a little bit more.
Thanks,
