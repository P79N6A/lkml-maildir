I tried the test pgm.
First run didn't even hit the disk, so I added O_SYNC to the opens.
No errors were detected.  Then i split out the checking code from the
building code after noticing the checks were run against the buffer cache.
Still no errors.
This is a SuSE 7.0 machine w/512M memory, plenty of disk space and no swap,
running 2.4.2
