Again something that could be easily handled by limiting "creative" uses of
C++.  Just using a regular constructor and calling it in a normal way (ex.
classptr = new classname(param, ...);) works perfectly well, is perfectly
readable, straitforward, and understandable.  Using this example to
criticize C++ is much less fair than Java trying to use pointers to
criticize C/C++.  At lease pointers are used and must be used commonly in
C/C++.  The above is need not be implemented in the way it was, I could
write just as crappy code in C if I decided to be creative.

No need to use temporary variables, again an example of people generally
trying to be creative.  A class could easily be implemented to assign
strings in a more effient manner, somthing like
stringname.assign_string("a", "b");.

C can even be more cryptic, especially with the extensive use of macros.

This can be done in C++.  You could do the same function pointer hack within
a C++ class.  You could keep that particular rare implementation in C as
well.  You could also do this with virtually inherited children.

Umm, the C function pointer sceme is also a hack, in that case to implement
an object-like model.
