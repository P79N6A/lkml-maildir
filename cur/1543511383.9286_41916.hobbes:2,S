p>After a few hours of use, the 3com 509 NIC that is connected to the cable

It's not a kernel problem it's a problem with netkit-base... it's not in
the errata (I don't think). I had exactly the same problem so I went and got
the netkit-base rpm which comes with RawHide and it fixed my problems.
netkit-base-0.10-37
[root@server chuck]# rpm -q  --file /bin/ping
netkit-base-0.10-37
