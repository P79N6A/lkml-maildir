Hi,                                                                             
Why does (2.2.14) linux/kernel/sched.c::count_active_tasks() consider tasks     
sleeping with the TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE flag to be the same as TASK_RUNNABLE     
for the avenrun computation?  (In 2.3.x the code is in linux/kernel/timer.c)    
It would seem that a sleeping task shouldn't contribute to the load avg...      
Thanks in advance,
