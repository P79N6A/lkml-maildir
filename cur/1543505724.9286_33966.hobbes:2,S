Subject: Linux 2.2.11 hang

(I originally sent this yesterday, but it seems to have disappeared as I
haven't seen it on the kernel list yet; apologies if this is a repeat)
After updating my machine to Linux 2.2.11 (from 2.2.10), it hung
solid after being up 2 days.  There was no response to keyboard/mouse, and
couldn't connect to the machine over the network (connection refused). My
desktop was still visible on the screen, but that was the only sign of life.
The lockup occured while I was away from the machine for 10 minutes, so I
wasn't running anything special.
This hasn't occured with earlier versions of the kernel. I'm afraid I don't
have much more info to provide other than system config and kernel config - if
there's any more info which I can provide to help, let me know.
System:
	Pentium-II 350
	128M ram
	D-Link DE-220P PnP Ethernet card
	ATI 3D Rage Pro AGP 2x video card
	mounted filesystems: ext2, msdos, ntfs, nfs, smbfs
	compiler: gcc-2.95
