This is not a bug. It is by intention. The LOG target (as well as the 
ULOG target from netfilter CVS) prints the whole layer two header.
6 bytes mac-source, 6 bytes mac-destination and 2 bytes (08:00) indicating
it is IP. == 14 bytes :)
On the other hand, the --mac-source match (emphasized mac-SOURCE) allows
you to match on the source part of this mac header (i.e. the first 6 bytes)
