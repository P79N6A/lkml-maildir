Makes sense to me.

I also recall a few oddball cases where PaX randomization broke things,
I'll try and dig one up and see if it fails as well on ExecShield.

IMO you have this backwards, John.  Rather than having the majority (ES,
mainline NX stuff) respect your less popular branch, it would make sense
to have PaX work as well as possible with PT_GNU_STACK, and politely
request that any missing functionality be duplicated in ES. PT_GNU_STACK
is the most widely available header, and we should leverage that
ubiquity as much as possible.  Marking our binaries with PT_PAX_FLAGS
and then begging everyone else to support our way of doing things will
never work.
