Hi!
Tried to compile util-linux-2.9i and failed.
SHM_DEST and SHM_LOCKED were not defined. I traced it down to
a missing definition of _SYS_SHM_H which is used by /usr/include/sys/shm.h
to acces /usr/include/linux/shm.h, which defines those missing definitions
SHM_DEST and SHM_LOCKED (and others).
Where is it defined? I grepped through /usr/include and below and through
/usr/src/linux and below and took a look at the specs-file of the gcc and
haven't found anything.
May be this a missing definition in the kernel sources of v2.2.2 at all?
KEEP HACKING!
