I've been gone for a while and suddenly drowning in mail...
Anyway, I don't really like the metafs thing.
To access the data, you still need to refactor userspace,
so that's not a real advantage. Doing lookups from /meta
all the time, instead of in the file-as-dir-whatever...
And the best thing to do would be to bring these "Reiser4-specific"
enhancements to every FS.
