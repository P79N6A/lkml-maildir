Hi.
This may be a stupid question, but I found this strange. In making a small
benchmarking utility, I made the following directory structure by mistake:
a/a/a/a/a/a/a/a/a/a/.....
By ..... I mean this goes on and on, there were around 18 thousand
directories inward like this. A great example of the damage a bug in a
recursive program can do ;) Anyway, I've removed it now (btw, rm -rf on
this sigsegved :D).
And now for the question. My /proc/meminfo looks like this:
        total:    used:    free:  shared: buffers:  cached:
Mem:  195678208 192753664  2924544        0 116613120 45502464

As you can see, there is no shared memory here. Is this something I ought
to worry about, or is it normal? I've been using the system, and since
things were lagging, I looked at 'top', and this just caught my eye.
Any reason for worry?
And if you *really* want me to, I can see if I can reproduce this, though
I'd rather not. :-)
