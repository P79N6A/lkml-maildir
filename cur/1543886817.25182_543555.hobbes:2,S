In which case we won't be freezing this task at all.

This is a special case that needs special handling.

Well, I disagree.  We need the locking *exactly* to avoid situations in which
the threads don't really change, but we might think that they *have changed*.
More precisely, it's needed, because without it kernel threads which execute
use_mm()/unuse_mm() might be identified as user space processes, and that
would be wrong.  The other cases are beyond the scope of this patch.
