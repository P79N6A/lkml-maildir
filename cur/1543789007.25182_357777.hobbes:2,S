I agree that dependability is important, but so important that we keep
the absolute worst case scenario for all cases because it could happen
occasionally? We can warn the user that removing media without umounting
/ejecting it may cause data loss and prompt them to reinsert the media.
If they don't reinsert the media soon enough (for any reason, including
the availabilty of memory) we can inform them that data loss may have
occured and that they should attempt to recover the file system.
