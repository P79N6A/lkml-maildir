Its an optimisation for probable packet paths. The 16 is chosen for
cache reasons too. The largest common packet transfer for forwarding is
one that adds 14 bytes of needed header space - slip/ppp -> ethernet so
we drop the 16 in to ensure that for almost all cases the packet
will not be copied

No you cannot. If you want an sk_buff with 16 bytes head room do
	skb=alloc_skb(len+16, GFP_whatever);
	if(skb==NULL) panic()
	skb_reserve(skb,16);

Correct. It may break in future if you use it for anything else.
