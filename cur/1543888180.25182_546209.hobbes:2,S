Well, it might decide it would be nicer if some elements were aligned to
64 bits. Or to a cache line. Or something. I don't care about _why_ --
the point is that it's _allowed_ to. Hence the original use of
__attribute__((packed)).
In practice, there's no real reason why it would do such a thing, which
is why I removed the packed attribute and replaced it with a runtime
check on the size of the structures in question.
