Hi all.
I'm delighted to announce that I've accepted a call to serve a congregation in 
Victoria, Australia, as a Home Missionary elder. As a result, some time in 
the next month or two, I will stop working for Cyclades and make the move.
Users of Suspend2 can rest assured that I will not allow the patches to suffer 
bitrot. I will be continuing to use them myself, and will therefore have the 
best of incentives to keep them up-to-date.
Now for the downside: I won't, however, be making any sort of concerted effort 
at getting them merged into the vanilla kernel after my move, and am not 
inclined to make a big effort beforehand. Recent discussions on LKML clearly 
showed that Pavel doesn't want to see them merged, and I didn't see much in 
the way of other kernel developers expressing a desire contrary to Pavel's 
wishes. I don't want to waste my time and effort, so I don't see the point to 
doing anything but maintaining the patches as they stand.
I'd like to take this opportunity to thank Cyclades for their employment and 
support of the project.
Regards,
Nigel
