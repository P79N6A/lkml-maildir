Linus, I hate to be a killjoy on this, but I just had to reboot again, 
it was killing processes, even first the shells I had open then kmail 
and X this time, but with nothing in the logs, and when X had quit, a 
top in the launching shell reported nearly 250 megs free with nothing 
in the swap.
So I'm not getting any usefull data, the machine is dog slow:
real    17m51.460s
user    13m11.201s
sys     1m34.718s
That should have been 6 minutes maximum.
I got rc4 as the whole thing just now, maybe there was something wrong 
with the 2.6.7 base I was using.  Thats rare since I quit getting 
the .bz2's, switching to tar.gz's which seem to be the more 
dependable format here.

The above was not available (X wouldn't restart), and trying to print 
from any kde app causes the app, and its launcher, to exit.  So I 
don't have a paper copy and my memory isn't photographic, please 
accept my apologies on this.  Maybe rc4 will also do it.  We'll find 
out I guess.  Reboot time again.
