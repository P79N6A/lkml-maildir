Per-page protections might be workable just through mremap().  As you
say, it's just a matter of appropriate bits in the swap entry.  To
userspace it is a transparent performance improvement.
Unfortunately without an appropriate bit in the pte too, that
restricts per-page protections to work only with shared mappings, or
anon mappings which have not been forked, due to the lack of COW.  It
would still be a good optimisation, although it would be a shame if,
say, a GC implementation of malloc et al. (eg. Boehm's allocator)
would not be transparent over fork().
