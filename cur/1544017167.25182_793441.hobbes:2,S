After making my latest changes, I see a half sec lag. I don't know
why it was so slow before. But I do have all the debug features enabled
which would also slow things down quite a bit (lockdep, et. al)

Now that I see only a 1/2 sec lag, do you still think this is necessary?
Maybe I should go back and see why it was so bad before?
But I do notice that not all functions produce a valid stack trace. Maybe 
it would be better to add that api :-?
