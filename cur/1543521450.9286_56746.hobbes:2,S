You can make things quite a lot better by including these lines in your 
program:
exit() { }
abort() { }
atexit() { }
void *__libc_stack_end;
The latter is really a granularity problem with libc but the first three are 
probably to be expected.  There's no easy way to avoid that excess code being 
linked in without imposing additional runtime overhead.
