Subject: wrong usage of __devexit_p and __exit_p

Hello,
I found several drivers that use __devexit_p and __exit_p on functions
that don't live in .devexit.text or .exit.text resp.
The impact is either that these functions use memory without being used
or that they don't link.
I send 24 patches as a reply to this mail.  I choosed to move the
functions into the respective function instead of using the right
__{dev,}exit_p wrapper because it seems to me to have less impact.
I didn't made the effort to find out the right people to Cc: but I hope
that Andrew takes care of that :-)
Best regards
Uwe
