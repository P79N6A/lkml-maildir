Actually, I was planning on doing on putting in a hack to do something
like that: calculate a checksum after every buffer data update and check
it after write completion, to make sure nothing scribbled in the buffer
in the interim.  This would also pick up some bad memory problems.

This is all coming, but as you say, it's not quite here yet.
