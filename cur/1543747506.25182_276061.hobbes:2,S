Subject: [2.6 patch] compile with -ffreestanding

Hi Andrew,
for the kernel, it would be logical to use -ffreestanding. The kernel is 
not a hosted environment with a standard C library.
The gcc option -ffreestanding is supported by both gcc 2.95 and 3.4, 
which covers the whole range of currently supported compilers.
I'm currently running a 2.6.10-rc2-mm4 with this patch applied and 
compiled with gcc 2.95 and haven't yet observed any problems.
Regarding changes caused by this patch:
Andi Kleen reported:
  Newer gcc rewrites sprintf(buf,"%s",str) to strcpy(buf,str) transparently.
This is only true with unit-at-a-time (disabled on i386 but enabled
on x86_64). The Linux kernel doesn't offer a standard C library, and
such transparent replacements of kernel functions with builtins are
quite fragile.
Even with -ffreestanding, it's still possilble to explicitely use a gcc
builtin if desired.
Could you add the patch below to the next -mm to see whether there are 
any problems I didn't find?
TIA
Adrian
