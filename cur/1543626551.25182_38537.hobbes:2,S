Because we don't _HAVE_ an API, let alone ABI.  What we have is 4000-odd
more or less randomly selected functions and variables that had been used
by some module at some point of history.
It's not an interface, it's a wide-open gut wound.  Yes, set of syscalls
is also too large and chaotic, but it's nowhere near that bad.
Situation in the tree itself is also not pretty, but there we at least
can do global changes.  With external stuff we don't have that, but
we can say "recompile and go ahead" - it reduces the set of changes we
can do without breakage, though.   With external binary stuff, we
are fucking stuck - a lot of things _will_ break it.
Again, that wouldn't be a problem if we had a well-defined interface.
We don't.
Moreover, "well-defined" includes mechanisms in place that would resist
changes and prevent adding random stuff to the interface.  Again, no
such thing.
And that's the real problem.  If we can turn the thing into stable _sane_
API (and that will mean changes in 3rd-party code and a *lot* of resistance
from binary-only module authors) - wonderful.  Until that happens any
talk about kernel/module boundary is crap.  There's none.  "You are allowed
to use this API without making your work a derivative" is all nice and
dandy.  When there is something that resembles an API.
