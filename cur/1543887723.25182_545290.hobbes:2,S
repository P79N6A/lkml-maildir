Because invalidate_inode_pages() forcibly removes the dirty flag from each page
in the inode and then calls invalidatepage() - and thus they don't get written
back, but some of those pages may contain writes from other processes.  The
whole inode isn't owned by one user at a time.
I hadn't considered invalidate_inode_pages_range(), but that suffers from the
deadlock problem.

 (1) prepare_write() is called with the target page locked and does not release
     the lock.  The truncation routines lock the page prior to invalidating it.
     Any truncation routine that skips locked pages is of no use.
 (2) Consider a run of pages that make up a single write by one user.  Two
     other writes from other users may be attempting to overwrite that run at
     the same time.  Each of them would need to invalidate the other's locked
     page(s).
Furthermore, the caller of prepare_write() probably won't take kindly to the
page it's dealing with being evicted from the pagecache.

How do you do a write-through cache for shared-writable mmap?

There might be, yes.  I guess I should ask the VM to nuke all PTEs to each of
these pages too.
