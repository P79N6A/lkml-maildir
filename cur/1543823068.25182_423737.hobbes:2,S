I've done that "two disconnected trees" in 2.0 kernel. Boot with an initrd.
/linuxrc runs something in the background (telnet server, just for kicks)
/initrd doesn't exist ont the new root.
So, try mount new root succeeds, but try unmount old root fails.
Presto. Two disconnected trees.
I wonder if it still works.
