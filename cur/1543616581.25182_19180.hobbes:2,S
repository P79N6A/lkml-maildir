Duh!!!  All of the reports thus far have been artsd.  My guess is that we 
are getting a signal during drain_dac() and returning with -ERESTARTSYS on 
close.  Well, as it turns out i810_release() isn't checking the return value 
of drain_dac() and if we take a signal in drain_dac() then i810_release() 
releases the card's data structs without actually shutting down the card: 
Lockup.  So, try this patch and see if it doesn't solve your problem.
