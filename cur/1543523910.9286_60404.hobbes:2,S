A small SMP kernel 2.2.14 (but I've seen similar effects 
since at least 2.0.x) crashes reproducible; hardware is
an old Gigabyte board 586DX with two Pentium 200 MMX.
Crashes are triggered e. g. under X by quick mouse (PS/2)
motion while running gv (PostScript viewer) or after some     
time compiling (e. g. make -j 6 zImage).  The only thing
I've found in the log-files is typically
   kernel: unexpected IRQ vector 77 on CPU#1!
   last message repeated 26 times
and sometimes (I'm not sure if this is "typically", 
I've seen it only recently (2.2.14?))
   kernel: unexpected IRQ vector 70 on CPU#0!
and            
   kernel: Uhhuh. NMI received for unknown reason 2d.
   kernel: Dazed and confused, but trying to continue
   kernel: Do you have a strange power saving mode enabled?
Magic SysRq works sometimes after the crash - sometimes not ...
(i. e. hardware reset necessary).
However, to trigger the crash easily, I must have run
  /bin/setserial /dev/ttyS1
Without that, the system is stable or at least much more
stable. setserial /dev/ttyS0 is no problem (and actually,
there is a modem connected to /dev/ttyS0, /dev/ttyS1 is not
used).
Any ideas or suggestions? Any more information I can
provide?
Thanks,
Olaf
