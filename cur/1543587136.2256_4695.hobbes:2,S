The situation might be clearer if you run with aic7xxx=verbose.
My guess is that the target detected a CRC error a transaction
and negotiated async as an indication that the initiator should
perform domain validation on this bus segment again.  Unfortunatly,
the driver doesn't yet support domain validation, so you end up
being stuck at 3.3MB/s.  I would suggest looking for problems with
your cabling or termination on that controller.
