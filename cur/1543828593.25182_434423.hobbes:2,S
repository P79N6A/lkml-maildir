How reproducible is it?  Is it reproducible even after xfs_repair?
If so, can you try Mandy's patch below, to see if it is addressing
the root cause of your problem?  If problems persist, a reproducible
test case would be wonderful, if one can be found..
cheers.

Fix nused counter.  It's currently getting set to -1 rather than getting
decremented by 1.  Since nused never reaches 0, the "if (!free->hdr.nused)"
check in xfs_dir2_leafn_remove() fails every time and xfs_dir2_shrink_inode()
doesn't get called when it should.  This causes extra blocks to be left on
an empty directory and the directory in unable to be converted back to
inline extent mode.
