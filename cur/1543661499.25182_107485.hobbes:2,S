Hi  All,
    I want to do two different linux installations rh 7.2 and rh 
8.0 on the same pc with single hard disk. I installed the rh 7.2 in
partitions say  /dev/hda5 ( /) ,  /dev/hda6  (/home) ,  /dev/hda7 (
/usr) ,
/dev/hda8 ( /tmp),... /dev/hda11  etc. 
   But how can I install the rh 8.0 in partitions say  /dev/hda12
( as "/" )  ... etc ??  Since the installer won't allow as there
already exists a  "/"  partition for the rh 7.2 and tries to override
it with the root partition of rh 8.0. So I tried giving a different
lable to the root partition of rh 8.0 say /root1 and other partitions
as /root1/usr, /root1/home, /root1/tmp etc. But here also the installer
is looking for the partition named "/" and without that the installation
is not happening. 
Please give your suggestions on how to resolve this problem.
At present my partition table with single installation (rh 7.2)  is,
[root@creddy-pc root]# fdisk -l
Disk /dev/hda: 255 heads, 63 sectors, 2434 cylinders
Units = cylinders of 16065 * 512 bytes
