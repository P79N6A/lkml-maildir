May  6 01:49:51 cobra kernel: keyboard: Timeout - AT keyboard not present?(ed)
problem exists for both 2.5.13 and 2.5.14 ( i wasn't able to get earlier 
kernels to work)
When X boots, the mouse works. Mouse freezes on attempt to type anything with 
the keyboard. Single - user mode: keyboard is dead by the time I need to type 
the root password.
Keyboard works fine with 2.4 kernels
