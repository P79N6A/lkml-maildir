Linus,
How about we kill these recursive oopsen by changing the
printk("Aiee, killing interrupt handler") to a panic?  If we're
entering do_exit() from an interrupt, we will eventually enter
schedule(), again as an interrupt, which will BUG(), and then
we'll repeat ad-infinitum.
panic() is better since we break this fatal recursive oops loop,
and we also get the additional advantage that a machine with
"panic=60" set will recover.
Currently, you hit this recursive oops problem, and its game over
until reset (unless you have a hardware watchdog).
