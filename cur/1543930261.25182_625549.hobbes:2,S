Thanks Dave. What version of gcc were you using? I haven't run into this.
BTW, nothing new was added in this patch, things were just shifted,
but even that may be copyrightable. Is it fair to assume you are
licensing these changes under the same license the file is in?
For this file we'd usually use:
Changes-licensed-under: 3-clause-BSD
