Given that the slave mode isn't supported by Linux at the moment, I
don't even see how this is relevant. (So I agree with you that this is
very low priority - I would even kill that part of the code.)

I don't see any relation with the slave address mechanism. The bus
speed is a simple parameter, internal to the device (i2c-core doesn't
care) so it should be very easy to move it to platform data. Not that I
really care, though.

No, it's not low priority, it's a blocker. I can't let that code go in.
The driver must do what it is told to do. If it can't, it must fail.
Yes, this means no (in-kernel) probing on this bus at the moment. Blame
it on the hardware manufacturer (if the chip actually can't do it.) In
user-space, i2cdetect can be told to use byte reads for probing.

This is an optional feature, most i2c adapter drivers don't implement
it. I'm fine without it, this can always be implemented later if needed.
I just sent my own review of the code. As you can see, I had quite a
few comments. Hopefully you now agree that pushing that code to Linus
right away wouldn't have been wise.
Thanks,
