Well, I don't see any shell code here, in /usr/bin/lzma as in istalled from
debian version 4.43-2.
But note that this lzma utility does not have any 'magic number' and does
no crc checks.  On the site it's said lzma(sdk) is under rewrite to support
new format with magic number and crc checks...
After reading this thread I wanted to teach GNU tar to automatically recognize
..tar.lzma archives - and failed, eactly because of the lack of magic number
at the start of a file...
