Right, but a sequence of smaller patches will be easier to get in.
I see this as a first step towards your larger patch ... if we can
do something simpler like Michael has, with enough view to your
later plans to make them merge together cleanly, I think we have
the best of both worlds ... Erich, what would it take to make this
a first stepping stone towards what you have? Or is it there already?
The fact that Michael's patch seems to have better performance (at
least for the very simple tests I've done) seems to reinforce the
"many small steps" approach in my mind - it's easier to debug and
analyse like that.

I don't think we should aim too hard for exactly equal balancing,
it may well result in small peturbations causing task bouncing between
nodes.

I'd add:
(d) take into account the RSS when migrating tasks across nodes
    (ie stickiness is proportional to amount of RAM used on nodes)

Agreed ;-)
