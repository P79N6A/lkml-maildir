Given that 99.99% of programs don't appear to care and you materially
slow down a critical path for every read and write I'm skeptical. 
Teaching the pipe code specifically to behave more nicely in this case
might be worthwhile (and as it happens with sockets in the same case you
can use shutdown() before close to get your preferred behaviour)
