I don't understand the proposal here.  There is a per-device lock
already.  But the plugged queue need to be on some list outside itself
so a group of them can be unplugged later on to flush all the I/O.

It's possible, yes.  It is the preferred solution.  We need to identify
all
the queues which need to be unplugged to permit a VFS-level IO request
to
complete.  It involves running down the device stack and running around
all
the contributing queues at each level.
Relatively straightforward, but first those dang sempahores in device
mapper need to become spinlocks.  I haven't looked into what
difficulties
might be present in the RAID implementation.
