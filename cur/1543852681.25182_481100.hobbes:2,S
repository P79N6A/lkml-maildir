I disagree that the ioremap change is needed.

Actually, ioremap itself already does the calculations that your patch
adds - that is, it generates the offset within the page and the
physical address of the start of the page, does the mapping using the
latter, then adds on the offset to the virtual address of the page and
returns that.
