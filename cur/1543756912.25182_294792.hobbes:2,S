Doing it "at memory management" is what many other OS's do and
is incredibly costly especially on SMP systems.  Please ponder
those issues for some time before you blast Linux's MM design
decisions.  They were not made in a vacuum.
I used to be heavily against this scheme long ago, but over time
I've seen more and more how it's the right thing to do.
