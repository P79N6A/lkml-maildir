I wouldn't recommend gutting the oom killer...

First you should know what is causing them. Is an application leaking 
memory, or is the kernel leaking memory? "ps" can help you answer the 
first question, while "watch cat /proc/meminfo" can help you answer the 
second.
If kernel memory usage seems to be rising steadily over time, report it as 
a bug. Otherwise, fix the broken application.
The reason for the "OOM killer" is because Linux does "VM overcommit". 
Please read "Documentation/vm/overcommit-accounting" for more information, 
including what you'll need if you want to disable "VM overcommit" to 
hopefully stop the OOM killer from coming around.
(When using VM overcommit, the OOM killer is very necessary for a healthy 
system... sometimes the kernel _needs_ memory, and you can't tell it NO. 
In those cases, the OOM killer is invoked to find something to 
sacrifice...)
