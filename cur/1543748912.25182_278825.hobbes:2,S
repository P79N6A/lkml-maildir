This is why I inserted pte_none() for each page_table in case of
read fault too.
If read access fault occured for the address "addr".
It is completely unnecessary to check by pte_none() to the page_table
for "addr". Because page_table_lock has never been released until
do_anonymous_page returns (in case of read access fault)
But there is not any guarantee that the page_tables for addr+PAGE_SIZE,
addr+2*PAGE_SIZE, ...  have not been mapped yet.
Anyway, I will try your V2 patch.
