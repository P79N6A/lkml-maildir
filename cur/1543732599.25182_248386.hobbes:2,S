What about my idea from yesterday of inverting the fastcall
relationship? Instead of creating a structure that exports values and
pointers the fastcall can use to create a time of day, why not use the
fast call to read the raw time and return it back to the time of day
code (which may be running in user context)? This avoids the duplication
of having to re-implement the timeofday/clock_gettime functions in
fastcall asm code.
