Hello kernel list
I knowm this is not really a kernel problem but I have been unable
to get this problem solved on other lists. I am having trouble
building a new 2.4.20 kernel on a machine running RedHat9 and
it appears that the problem has something to do with the mptbase
module (scsi module?).
The machine is a Dell Precision 350 machine and lspci tells me this
about my SCSI controller:
02:07.0 SCSI storage controller: LSI Logic / Symbios Logic 53c1030 (rev 07)
02:07.1 SCSI storage controller: LSI Logic / Symbios Logic 53c1030 (rev 07)
I am trying to recompile my kernel but after when doing a "make install"
I get the folloeing error message:
sh -x ./install.sh 2.4.20-rthal5 bzImage /usr/src/linux-2.4.20/System.map ""
+ '[' -x /root/bin/installkernel ']'
+ '[' -x /sbin/installkernel ']'
+ exec /sbin/installkernel 2.4.20-rthal5 bzImage
/usr/src/linux-2.4.20/System.map ''
No module mptbase found for kernel 2.4.20-rthal5
mkinitrd failed
make[1]: *** [install] Error 1
make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/linux-2.4.20/arch/i386/boot'
make: *** [install] Error 2
There does not exist a /lib/modules directory for my new modules
and it looks like "make install" can't find the mptbase driver.
Does any one know how to fix this?
Thanks a bunch,
Daniel
