???  I'm talking about the name/directory collision you get when you have
multiple builds of the same version of the kernel.  This happens, for
instance, whenever a newbie installs Linux & then tries to recompile the
kernel.  What I think I am suggesting is adding an extension (to
EXTRAVERSION?) for each build to guarantee that collisions are avoided.
