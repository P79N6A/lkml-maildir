O.K.  Let's test some more assumptions.  Can you apply the following
patch and observe the system logs when the device is first loaded and
again after resume.  The patch looks at the pci command register to
verify that memory space IO is indeed enabled.  (It should be.)  This is
all that should be needed for MMIO to work.
If the PCI_COMMAND message doesn't match, then it means that the
PCI_COMMAND register isn't getting restored for some reason.  If they do
match, then something else in the system is not getting restored
correctly.
