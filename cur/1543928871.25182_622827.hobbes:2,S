BTW, that's a fine example of a common fallacy: "$FOO is 98% of the way to
$TARGET" does not allow to interpolate the properties of $TARGET to those
of $FOO.
Telling that a condom is a 98% approximation to platonic ideal of such is
not particulary useful, especially if it turns out that what this number 
really means is that there's a hole on its tip covering 2% of surface...
