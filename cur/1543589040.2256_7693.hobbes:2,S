I believe it is common practice for this type of problem is to mix both
approaches:
Wait for a certain number of requests *OR* a timeout, whichever comes first.
Then, if there's not much IO, things are still guaranteed to be updated
reasonably
quickly.  If io is heavy,
then things will be updated in large chunks, becoming more efficient (fewer
interrupts) when it is needed most.
