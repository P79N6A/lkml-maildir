Well, in that case - the original patch sent out is good enough to fix
the problem. All the original patch did was after completing the IO,
truncated the size to filesize. The problem is only with the last
block in the file. If the file ends in the middle of the block, we
go ahead and read till the end of the block. I was trying to address
that issue. But, if the block is already zeroed, just truncating the
size after the IO is complete should be good enough.
Thanks,
