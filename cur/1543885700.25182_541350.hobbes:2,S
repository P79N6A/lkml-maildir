bio[n - 1].bi_sector + bio_sectors(bio[n - 1]) == bio[n].bi_sector
IOW, the bio's in the chain on the request are contig in the lba space.

Yeah, I think it's pointless to support highmem. And as long as you
don't call blk_queue_bounce_limit() to actively enable highmem, you are
not going to receive a bio/request with highmem pages. The block layer
wil bounce any highmem pages before it reaches you. So for a driver like
this, I would recommend just forgetting the mapping aspect.
I don't have time to review your driver right now, but I will applaud
your effort to write a maintenable mitsumi driver! Basically all the old
cdrom drivers are utter crap, so they are destined for removal.
