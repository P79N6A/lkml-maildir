Hi everyone,
I'm just writing to say how impressed I am with the new CFS scheduler.
 I've been following it's development from the first patch, right up
to now (running on the latest vanilla kernel I could!) and I can
honestly say I've never had such a responsive experience.
I'm currently writing a major patch to the ext2 file-system driver, as
part of a University project - it involves a lot of kernel rebuilds as
I'm testing the patch in UML.  I've had a couple of kernel compiles
happening simultaneously (on my moderate single CPU PC), and tried out
a few make -j12's, and I'm amazed at the difference the new scheduler
makes.
I've got quite a few instances of Firefox (whoops, Iceweasel) open,
I'm listening to music and theres a few other apps running (like KNode
the newsreader) and the interactivity response has been excellent.
In conclusion, well done to the scheduler people and I look forward to
seeing this go to mainline.
(If there's anything I can do to help, I'd love to throw a few patches
at the mailing list ;)
