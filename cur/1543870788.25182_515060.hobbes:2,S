I'm not talking about cache warm up. And if we do - and that the whole
freaking point of AIO - Linux IIRC pins freshly loaded clean pages
anyway. So there would be problem but only under memory pressure. If
you under memory pressure - you already lost the game and do not care
about performance/what threads you are using.
It is the whole "threadlets to threads on blocking" things doesn't
sound convincing. It sounds more like "premature optimization". But
anyway, not that I'm AIO specialist. For networking it is totally
unnecessary since most applications which care have already rate
control and buffer management built in. Network connections/sockets
allows greater level of application control on what and how they do.
Compared to blockdev's plain dumb read()/write() going through global
cache. And not that (judging from interface) AIO changes that much -
it is still dumb read() what IMHO makes no sense whatsoever to mmap()
oriented Linux.
