ftp://people.redhat.com/mharris/hacks/mingetty
This allows you to do:
5:2345:respawn:/sbin/mingetty --autologin=mharris tty5
in /etc/inittab at boot time.  The only problem with it is if you
upgrade and mingetty gets upgraded the standard mingetty doesn't
grok --autologin so it explodes and respawns until init kills it.
I'm rewriting it to use a config file instead, and might possibly
change the name if Florian doesn't mind.
