For example, I have a test that locks some pages, then calls
mlockall(MCL_FUTURE).  Resutls in unlocking all locked pages.
# pages locked, before MCL_FUTURE
$ cat /proc/`pidof mlockall`/status | grep VmLck
VmLck:      1244 kB
# after MCL_FUTURE
$ cat /proc/`pidof mlockall`/status | grep VmLck
VmLck:         0 kB
And, with just a simple call to MCL_FUTURE:
# before MCL_FUTURE
$ cat /proc/`pidof mlockall`/status | grep VmLck
VmLck:         0 kB
# after MCL_FUTURE
$ cat /proc/`pidof mlockall`/status | grep VmLck
VmLck:         0 kB
Now with the patch:
# pages locked, before MCL_FUTURE
$ cat /proc/`pidof mlockall`/status | grep VmLck
VmLck:      1244 kB
# after MCL_FUTURE
$ cat /proc/`pidof mlockall`/status | grep VmLck
VmLck:      1244 kB
	    ^^^^^^^
That's the only differenece, and I believe fixes a real bug whose
existance is more likely to surprise apps than it's squashing ;-)
And, again (unchanged) with just a simple call to MCL_FUTURE:
# before MCL_FUTURE
$ cat /proc/`pidof mlockall`/status | grep VmLck
VmLck:         0 kB
# after MCL_FUTURE
$ cat /proc/`pidof mlockall`/status | grep VmLck
VmLck:         0 kB
The crux of the problem is in do_mlockall() in the for loop:
                newflags = vma->vm_flags | VM_LOCKED;
                if (!(flags & MCL_CURRENT))
                        newflags &= ~VM_LOCKED;
                mlock_fixup(vma, vma->vm_start, vma->vm_end, newflags);
So, for flags == MCL_FUTURE only, might as well bail out before the loop,
since MCL_FUTURE does nothing w.r.t. current mappings.
