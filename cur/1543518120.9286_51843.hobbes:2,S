The kernel does not report back to hdparm the "corrected" raw or current
values of geometry...
purcell:/proc/ide/hda # cat  geometry
physical     26853/16/63
logical      1684/255/63
raw          16383/16/63	< additions added to prove the point >
current      16383/16/63	< additions added to prove the point >
Now go cat /proc/ide/hd(X)/geometry
Then tell us that answer...please.
