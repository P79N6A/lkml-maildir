Hi, guys, I have a small question about
/proc/sys/vm/bdflush . I am working on a SMP machine.
The kernel version is 2.4.18. I want to modify the
content of /proc/sys/vm/bdflush. But once I modify the
content, it will go back to the default value after I
reboot the OS. Is there a way by which I can
permanently change the content of this file? The OS
keeps the default value in somewhere? 
Thanks in advance.
