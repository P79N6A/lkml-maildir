They're also unused...I'll remove them.

Hmm. uart_circ_get_multiple() or something?
Also, we should probably be using UART_XMIT_SIZE here, not
SERIAL_XMIT_SIZE. Why do we have two such definitions (which both
happen to be PAGE_SIZE)?

Hmm...I don't understand. What does it do wrong?

Hmm...no. I think we really want something CIRC_CNT_TO_END()-ish.

Yeah. Would you like a patch that inline-ifies <linux/circ.h>?

Absolutely.

No. "head" is the current offset that the DMA controller is reading
from, while "tail" is the offset we stopped at the last time around.
head will only wrap around when we recycle the DMA buffer, and when
that happens, we explicitly set tail to 0.
