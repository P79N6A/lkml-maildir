Just as a heads up, I have now confirmed that the problem does not
happen on vanilla 2.6.13.1. The config is a bit different, but mostly
the same - although I had to disable SELinux due to other reasons, so
that might still be the culprit. Or the bug may have been fixed, or
never existed, in the mainline kernel.
