These are the more common MVP3s. The host bridge has a programmable
device ID, which most BIOSen set to VP3 for some unknown reason.
Driver backwards compatability?
Though I have reports from users of this type that they are generally not as
reliable wrt HDD DMA, and AGP x2 as the 'true' MVP3s.

Dave.
