    ACPI: Enable C3 even when PM2_control is zero
    On systems that do not have pm2_control_block, we cannot really use
    ARB_DISABLE before C3. We used to disable C3 totally on such systems.
    To be compatible with Windows, we need to enable C3 on such systems now.
    We just skip ARB_DISABLE step before entering the C3-state and assume
    hardware is handling things correctly. Also, ACPI spec is not clear
    about pm2_control is _needed_ for C3 or not.
    We have atleast one system that need this to enable C3.
