thanks. In -52-09 i've unapplied the original patch, and i've now 
uploaded -52-10 with Daniel's original patch plus your patch applied.
I think 10 seconds is pretty reasonable - if an RT task runs 
uninterrupted for that long time i think we want to know about it. It's 
not illegal for an RT task to monopolize the CPU for that long, but it's 
certainly unusual enough to warn about. (and the warning can be turned 
off)
