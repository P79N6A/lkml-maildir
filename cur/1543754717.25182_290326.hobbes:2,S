Nope, RLIMIT_RSS does not seem to be used at all in v2.6:
linux-2.6.11-rc1 # findgrep RLIMIT_RSS
./fs/proc/array.c
./include/asm-arm26/resource.h
./include/asm-ia64/resource.h
./include/asm-frv/resource.h
./include/asm-i386/resource.h
./include/asm-alpha/resource.h
./include/asm-ppc64/resource.h
./include/asm-x86_64/resource.h
./include/asm-s390/resource.h
