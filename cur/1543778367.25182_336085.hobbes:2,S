Actually this has a much greater potential of loosing buffers because
we have to poll the buffer for completion. Seen another way, the kernel-
side has got to wait until the user-side has "figured out" that it needs
to commit content to disk. As it was originally, it was relatively
straightforward to dertermine why data was lost: ok, we've signaled it
from kernel space, but the daemon never flushed it out. Without commit/
deliver, things are much less clear, and I still miss what gain we
are making by removing them.
I would very much like to see the commit/deliver functionality back.
Such mechanisms are required for any sane producer-consumer model.
