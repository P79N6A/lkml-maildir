No comparison possible. The amiga dos would stall all read/write
requests when a device came offline (e.g. a floppy disk ejected) and
would cancel them all if the user or something else decided the medium
wouldn't be available anymore, and resumed everything when the medium
was online again (even if in a different device/drive).
That was a pretty sophisticated volume management if you ask me, one I
can only dream of happening one day in linux.
