Hmm....  I suspect the problem is that serial8250_isa_init_ports()
doesn't initialize port->type for the ports in SERIAL_PORT_DFNS,
so we fail the console setup.
Does the attached patch make it work like it used to?  ISTR that
Russell didn't really like testing port->ops, but I can't remember
why, and I don't see anything better.
