You should probably direct Xen questions to the Xen users or
developers mailing list.
I have Xen running happily with various versions of adp94xx and
aic94xx. aic94xx has recently been merged into the mainline Linux
kernel (as of 2.6.19-rc1, which isn't out yet) but Xen is currently at
2.6.16.29, so it will take a bit for it to trickle down.
Cheers,
Muli
