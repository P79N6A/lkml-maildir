The basic idea is to allow modules to let the unload fail. The unload
process would basically look like this:
	unregister all interfaces;
	if (no users)
		free all resources;
These two phases have to be done anyway, making it explicit in the module
interface gives more control to the user, e.g. you can disallow the
mounting of a new fs, while others are still mounted.

I meant the first entry point into the module code that needs to be
protected (e.g. get_sb during mount).

It's possible to use the filesystem model, but it's unnecessary complex
and inflexible. It should be possible to keep try_inc_mod_count() out of
the hot paths, but you have to call it e.g. at every single open().
Another problem is that the more interfaces a module has (e.g. proc), the
harder it becomes to unload a module (or the easier it becomes to prevent
the unloading of a module).

The problem is that the module can't do anything with that information, at
the time cleanup_module() is called it's already to late. That information
has currently to be managed completely outside of the module.
