Hi Markus,
> Anyway, I just installed BitKeeper and start finding my way into the code...
Maybe setting up an own repository (like the parisc, mips, m68k, etc
people currently do using CVS) would also be a good idea, just to test out
stuff before pushing it into the main tree and to have a common code base
to work on.
This way we could apply e.g. the module patch from kernel.org and fix the
remaining parts.
