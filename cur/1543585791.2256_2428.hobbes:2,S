This is tweaking 39 symbols out of 1831, hardly large-scale.  These
irregularities in the namespace cause trouble out of all proportion to
their size, is my problem.  If you knew what I've been through trying
to write analysis tools...*shudder*...

My patch fixes those installer utilities.  All three of them.  And no driver
code is or possibly could be broken by it, that's a red herring.  *No
object code will change as a result of this patch*.

Yes, I know, that's what I said about Peter's DERIVED patch a week ago.
You notice *he* ain't bitching about this one?
I want this in before the 2.5 fork for several reasons:
(1) 19 of the 39 changes fix things that are outright bugs even in CML1.
    These should not be allowed to persist in the stable branch.
(2) I want to finish my analysis tools and do some really thorough
    consistency and correctness checking before the stable branch
    separates.  Alan will thank me for this later.
(2) If we do adopt CML2, having these changes in will make it *far* 
    easier to contemplate back-porting it to 2.4.x later on.
The present configuration system is a mess, everybody agrees on that.
I'm trying to clean it up, and it's a tedious and grubby enough job
even with the full cooperation of the kbuild team.  Jeff, would you
please support this instead of obstructing it?

  "This movement of yours, does it have slogans?" inquired the Chink.
  "Right on!" they cried. And they quoted him some.
  "Your movement, does it have a flag?" asked the Chink.
  "You bet!" and they described their emblem.
  "And does your movement have leaders?"
  "Great leaders."
  "Then shove it up your butts," said the Chink. "I have taught you nothing."
