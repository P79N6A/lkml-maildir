   If so, what if the bug had nothing whatsoever to do with VMWARE,
   but was in fact a legit kernel bug?  Is there not a way to tell at
   all?
Without source code to VMWARE's kernel modules, we cannot
know what it does, nor can we fix the problem even if we
wanted to.  So therefore it is a big question mark every
time we get a report when VMWARE is being used, and most
of the time we are just going to tell people to go to
them about the problem.  They offer support with their
product right?
This is the price you pay for proprietary software, you've
put a black box into your kernel which no-one but them can
help you fix problems with.
