Hello,
I received a forwarded message from SuSE regarding a security vulnerability
with respect to randomization of the ISN for SYN cookies - or something to
that effect.  I have not been able to find the patch which addresses this
problem; if anyone can point me towards it, I would be appreciative.
thanks,
-bp
