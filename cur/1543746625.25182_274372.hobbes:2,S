Dear Sirs,
Recenly, I test five big distributions with almost all kernels
from 2.4.21 to 2.6.9 on several slow computers with many different
(not quite new) graphics cards (most of them - nvidia: Riva TNT,
GeForce, GeForce2 and S3Savage).
I observe very wrong Xserver performance on each of kernel 2.6.x
and good performance on every 2.4.x kernel when computer boot
with vesafb
For example, when I try mplayer or xine - CPU utilization
by X process is 30 times larger on 2.6.x kernel then 2.4.x

Every time when I use 2.6.x kernel I get warnigs (in xorg.log) similar
this:
(WW) NV(0): Failed to set up write-combining range
(0xe3000000,0x1000000)
When I use boot option "video=vesafb:nomtrr" with any 2.6.x kernel,
Xserver performance is nearly as good as under 2.4.x kernel
and warning (in xorg.log) does not appear.
It seems to be a problem with mtrr and vesafb described several times,
for example Jan 18, 2004 in thread "Overlapping MTRRs in 2.6.1"
but it was a long time ago.
My questions are simple:
1. The problem is because of a kernel bug or because of kernel feature?
2. Is this the same problem all the time not resolved yet
   or I found several different kernel bugs (with the same symptoms)?
   I did not test 2.6.0, 2.6.2 and 2.6.5 kernel yet:-)
Inspite of this problem is not as important as for example kernel panic
I am sure because of it many of trivial users think linux is slowly :-)

P.S.
Sorry for my English. It is not as perfect as I wish it to be.
