Linus sees Kai as being the most promising fellow to
integrate kbuild2.5 right now (see
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=102307114005894&w=2 )
and Kai is willing to take it on in just the way Linus wants.
It's probably worth giving Kai and Linus the benefit of the doubt for a while,
even if it does mean having to rejigger the kbuild-2.5 patch
each time Linux accepts one of Kai's patches.
I personally am anxious to see kbuild-2.5 make it into the kernel,
but I also feel it can only benefit from a strong review of
the sort that comes about during gradual evolution
of the kernel build process towards the techniques used by kbuild-2.5.
Thanks to everyone, Keith, Daniel, Thunder, and Kai, who are
working (together or not!) on moving the kernel build process
into the modern era.
