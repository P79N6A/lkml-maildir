For HugeTLB, there are cases were the sysadmin won't configure the server
because it's a tunable that can badly affect the machine if they get it
wrong. In those cases, the users just get small pages, the performance
penalty and are told to like it.

Ok, so lets consider the 99.99% of users then. One two machines, aim9
benchmarks posted during this thread show some improvements on page_test,
fork_test and brk_test, the paths you would expect to be hit by these
patches. They are very minor improvements but 99.99% of users benefit from
this. Aim9 might be considered artifical so somewhere in that 99.99% of
users are kernel developers who care about kbuild so here are the timings
of "kernel untar ; make defconfig ; make"
2.6.14-rc5-mm1:				1093 seconds
2.6.14-rc5-mm1-mbuddy-v19-withoutdefrag 1089 seconds
2.6.14-rc5-mm1-mbuddy-v19-withdefrag::  1086 seconds
The withoutdefrag mark is with the core of anti-defrag disabled via a
configure option. The option to disable was a separate patch produced
during this thread. To be really honest, I don't think a configurable page
allocator is a great idea.
Building kernels is faster with this set of patches which a few people on
this list care about. aim9 shows very minor improvements which benefit a
very large number of people and 0.01% of people who care about
fragmentation get lower fragmentation.
Of course, maybe there is something magic with my test machines (or maybe
I am willing it faster) so figures from other people wouldn't hurt whether
they show gains or regressions. On my machine at least, 99.99% of people
are still benefitting.
I am going to wait to see if people post figures that show regressions
before asking "are you still saying no?" to this set of patches
