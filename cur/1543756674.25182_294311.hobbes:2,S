Hi,
I'm running Linux 2.6.10 from Fedora Core 2  and I have enabled
rejected packet logging so
log-watch is able to alert me on possible attacks.   This however goes
in "dmesg" making it unusable to check for serious condition.  Is
there any way to only redirect such messages to the file
without having them in Dmesg ? 
Thanks.
