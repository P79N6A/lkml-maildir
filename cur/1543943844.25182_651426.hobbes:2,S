something related or not.
my server doesn't have serial connector. the SP has serial port to
host's internal serial port.
I need to ssh to SP ( service processor) and start console there.
wonder if there is program that is running on SP, and one program on
develop workstation --- make it have one virtual serial port
gdb or other legacy serial port program could use that virtual serial port.
