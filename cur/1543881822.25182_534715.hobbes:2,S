The forcedeth on my nforce2 board is 100Mbit.  I think the driver
handles both 100Mbit and GBit type devices.  Makes for an interesting
categorization problem.  Moving it would cause confusion.  Leaving it
where it is could cause confusion.  Moving it may confuse existing users
more though so I would recommend leaving it alone unless you can somehow
make it appear in both.
