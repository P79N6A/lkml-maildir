Hi,
I wish to be personally CC'ed the answers/comments posted to the list in 
response to this post
why in multithreading, each thread has its own stack, but all share the same 
heap?
I understand that one stack is needed for each thread as each could have its 
own procedure call. but why we don't associate a heap for each thread since 
each thread can also create dynamically its own data?
Many thanks
