Same with set_phy_reg, ohci_soft_reset, ohci_hw_csr_reg. At least the 
callers of ohci_hw_csr_reg (in particular, csr_highlevel.host_reset, 
furthermore csr_highlevel.add_host) could fairly easily be converted to 
a workqueue job or perhaps moved to the nodemgr thread. I have not 
checked the other offending functions yet.
