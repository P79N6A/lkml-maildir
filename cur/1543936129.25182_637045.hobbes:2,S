What Dick writes is true.
If you can move devices between slots, you can often get onto a different
physical interrupt wire.
However, if your system has an IOAPIC but you're not using IOAPIC mode,
often that programs the "glue" above so spread interrutps out.
See if your BIOS setup has any IRQ options, and see if your kernel
has the IOAPIC enabled.  dmesg would tell.
