	This message is partly an answer to some questions I've seen on
this list in the previous months and (most important) it asks some stuff
I'd like to know.
	Things I've already discovered:
	The (UMAX) UDS-IS11 card is a super-cheap SCSI-II ISA card made in
Taiwan that usually ships with SCSI scanners made in that part of the
globe. I have a KYE (Genius) HR-5 (Astra 1200S clone) that came with
such a card.
	The card is based on the DTC-3181x chip. On the chip itself you
will find written DTC436E (or P). There are plenty of card revisions out
there, a good source for identifying them is at:
	
http://www.imcnet.com/support/doc/f096B.htm
	A couple of months ago Alan said something about the brains of
UMAX and I tend to agree. However not all hope is lost. Some card
revisions feature a magic jumper J1. By default this thing is on (and if
you're unlucky its soldered) and it makes the card work in Plug and Run
mode (that is brain-dead). What it means is that the card has no IRQ, only
a port range. When the PC is booted the 3181 will scan for a free port
range starting from 0x300 and will configure itself for that. This really
works, as I have a NIC at 0x300 and the 3181 stucks to 0x280.
	The nice part comes if you can remove J1, you get a PNP card! And
it does feature an IRQ. Whether it works or not I cannot say right now.
The output from pnpdump follows:
(CONFIGURE DTC436e/-1 (LD 0
#     Logical device decodes 10 bit IO address lines
#         Minimum IO base address 0x0240
#         Maximum IO base address 0x03e0
#         IO base alignment 32 bytes
#         Number of IO addresses required: 32
# (IO 0 (SIZE 32) (BASE 0x0240))
#     IRQ 3, 4, 5, 11 or 15.
#         High true, edge sensitive interrupt
# (INT 0 (IRQ 3 (MODE +E)))
 (NAME "DTC436e/-1[0]{DTC436E             }")
# (ACT Y)
))
# End tag... Checksum 0x00 (OK)
	Most scanner manufacturers don't seem eager to tell their
customers that in fact they have a fully functional ISA PNP card! For DOS
and windoze9x/NT there is a full ASPI driver at:
	
http://www.domex.com.tw/service_/index_01.htm#scsi_driver_download
	I've managed to activate the card with isapnp, but none of the
drivers I've tried with a 2.0.36 kernel worked. The one for DTC 8x30
failed to detect the board (as it looked for completely different
parameters) and the g_NCR5380 hanged despite my attempt to launch it as a
NCR53c400. The 3181LE I've got claims to be NCR 400a compatible.
	My card has a P/N: 970160-16 and a DTC-3181LE chip. This matches
the inscription on the back of the PCB which may be found near the
external connector, in fact the only one on this revision.
	The DOS driver says something like this on startup:
	DTC-3X8X/3X5X SCSI ASPI Manager for DOS, Version 3.9T.05 08/22/96
	Also the windoze drivers are for an 328x. So, I assume that there
is not much difference between the chips. It looks like an initialization
problem.
	Domex (former DTC) seems Linux friendly; in fact they have Linux
drivers for the high-end DMX3194, but tough luck with 3181x.
	So, my hope is that one of you SCSI guru guys will get the info
from Domex and tweak the driver. If you think it's not worth the effort
please try to get some info and pass it to me. I'm new to Linux drivers,
but I might be able to capitalize on the existing DTC stuff.
	Best wishes and Happy New Year (almost forgot!),
	Vasile
