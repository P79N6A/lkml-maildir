  (That's when the spring in the usb connector decides it had enough and 
  spits the ipod cable out. It is advised to wear a helmet to not get hurt 
  by the HV usb device, e.g. usb mass storage sticks. j/k)
Ejecting flash media is what `sdparm -C eject /dev/sdX` does. In case of 
cdroms, that's eject. In case of zip drives, I guess, it will be - see 
above - unloading zip disks via springs (now these things really eject 
hard), and in case of mass storage drives that can usually not be ejected 
(so-called "non-removable media", such as harddisks), it disconnects them. 
Another stage after umount, so to speak. (And BTW, you cannot run `sdparm 
-C load` on these usb media again; at least I cannot for my memory stick.)
