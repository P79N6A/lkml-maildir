I don't think that we'll see a global clock with reliable femtosecond resolution 
(not to talk about accuracy) in the foreseeable computer generations. Even plain 
gigahertz RAM is quite some time away. So how would you distribute such high 
resolution time across CPUs? As long as a syscall takes significantly longer than 
1ns, or has a jitter of more than 1ns, a higher resolution clock would be just a 
source of additional noise bits.
