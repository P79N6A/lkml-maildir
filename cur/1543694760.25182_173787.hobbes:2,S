The 2.6.0-test-7 boots fine and works great -- until I plug
in the ethernet cable. Within a second I get an oops and
everything freezes. Booting with "acpi=off" makes no difference.
If I boot with the ethernet cable plugged in, I get to the 
login prompt, and it oopses within a second. If I time it right,
I can log into the machine remotely for one second before it 
oopses (so the natsemi driver is working). Very reproducible! 
/proc/kmsg is empty. 
If I compile natsemi as a module, I don't get the oops. 
However, now the driver is not working -- I can't ping out.
Everything works fine in 2.5.69, which I've been running
since early July.
Here's some of the oops, taken by hand:
Process swapper (pid: 0, threadinfo=c042a000 task c03a47a0)
Stack
Call trace:
ipxitf_auto_create
ipx_rcv
netif_receive_skb
process_backlog
net_rx_action
do_softirq
do_IRQ
_stext
common_interrupt
acpi_processor_idle
cpu_idle
start_kernel
unknown_bootoption
Kernel panic: Fatal exception in interrupt
In interrupt handler -- not syncing
Configuration, lspci, and dmesg attached.
Cheers,
David
