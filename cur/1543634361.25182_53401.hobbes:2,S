Subject: another sched.c error with athlon

Here's another error I'm getting from sched.c and don't seem to be
able to find where it should be #define'd.
  gcc -Wp,-MD,./.sched.o.d -D__KERNEL__
  -I/usr/src/linux-2.5.23/include -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes
-Wno-trigraphs -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer -fno-strict-aliasing
-fno-common -pipe -mpreferred-stack-boundary=2 -march=i686
-malign-functions=4  -nostdinc -iwithprefix include
-fno-omit-frame-pointer -DKBUILD_BASENAME=sched   -c -o sched.o
sched.c
sched.c: In function `sys_sched_setaffinity':
sched.c:1332: `cpu_online_map' undeclared (first use in this function)
sched.c:1332: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
sched.c:1332: for each function it appears in.)
sched.c: In function `sys_sched_getaffinity':
sched.c:1391: `cpu_online_map' undeclared (first use in this function)
make[1]: *** [sched.o] Error 1
The only reference I can find is in smp.h but don't see it actually
declared there either only used.  I'm not using smp and have
CONFIG_smp set to no.
