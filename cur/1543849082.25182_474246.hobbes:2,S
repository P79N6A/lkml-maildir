Suresh,
I have a patch (though a very old one...) for handling hotplug and cpusets.
However there were some ugly locking issues and nesting of locks that I
ran into and I never got the time to sort them out. Also there didnt
seem to be any users for it and so I had no motivation to further complicate
the cpusets code/sched domains code. However I can dust up the patches if
there is a need
