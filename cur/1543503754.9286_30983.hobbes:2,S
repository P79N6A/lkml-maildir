Hi!
  I'm a LUG president in western Canada, don't get involved
in kernel development.  But I am involved in LPRng, a print
spooling system.  A while ago, it was pointed out that
RedHat 6.0 (probably Linux in general) has a "bug" in
that they set the f_frsize value in struct statvfs to
0 instead of the f_bsize value.
  Anyway, as I don't know where to pass this onto, I was
hoping maybe you did.
  Have a great weekend.
Gordon Haverland
