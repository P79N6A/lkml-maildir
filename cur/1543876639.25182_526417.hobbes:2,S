I honestly don't doubt that there are regressions, somewhere.  Could you
elaborate, and perhaps actually show us some numbers on this?  Perhaps
instead of adding a completely new model, we can adapt the existing ones
somehow.
But, without some cold, hard, data, we mere mortals without the 1024-way
machines can only guess. ;)
