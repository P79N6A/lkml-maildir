not at all. It's just that patches on the list take more and more time
to check, we're around something like 1 patch for 5 mails. And when the
author himself suggests that the patch is not for inclusion, it wastes
time. However, I agree that Alexey announced it as [RFC] and not [PATCH],
so he proceeded correctly and I was wrong to yell at him (that's why I
apologised when I noticed this). But generally speaking, I do not find
it very constructive to send random work in which even the author does
not believe. It only lowers the SNR.
