My appologies, it wasn't intended.  I changed a few files from semaphores
to completions and sent them off to Ingo to work on.  I tried to always CC
the maintainers that are either listed in the file or in MAINTAINERS.  I
must have missed you (and probably others).
This was by no means something to circumvent the maintainer, it was just
an oversight.
