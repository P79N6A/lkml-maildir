The spirit gives the intuition of "passing on all the rights".  The
legal terms have to be more careful about that, to avoid the very
situation you're debating, so they state "you can't impose further
restrictions on the exercise of the rights".
Do you understand the difference?

No dispute about that, and this is irrelevant to this point.  I've
already responded and clarified this point 2 or 3 times in this
thread.  Do you need me to find a URL for you?  It was in respose to
Dmitri Torokhov.

In fact, I haven't even tried.  So far, I've merely been trying to
show that it still follows the same spirit, dispelling the muth that
it doesn't, and trying to understand why you think GPLv2 is so much
better, which I think is related with tit-for-tat and retribution in
kind.
