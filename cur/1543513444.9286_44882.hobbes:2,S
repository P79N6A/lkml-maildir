"enable_pci_device()" does that.
I do NOT think that finding a device should automatically enable it.
Especially as there are known instances where you might have to do extra
work before you truly enable it (ie USB would usually need to make sure
that the SMI interrupt is disabled before it takes over the USB device, so
that a SMM BIOS won't do anything confusing).
Don't make a monster. Make something that is simple, and expand on it as
needed. I do not like the way you usually sit on the code until you are
happy, and then release it in one big bunch without any input from others.
I prefer the incremental approach.
