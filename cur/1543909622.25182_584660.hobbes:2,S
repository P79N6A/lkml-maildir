IMHO, the DEBUG_KERNEL will build a big kernel and the building time
is long, so if the we only want to look at the boot messages at panic
point, the DEBUG_KERNEL is not needed.

I386 for me. I tested boot_delay=300 again:
1. From "Uncompressing Linux.. Ok,booting the kernel" to "console
[tty0] enabled"
keep the same screen about 5-6 minutes
2. After that every line will need 20-30 seconds.
