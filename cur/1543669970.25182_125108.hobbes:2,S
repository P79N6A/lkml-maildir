I was just about to propose the same. Please use subdirs or namespaced files
like in:
for I in "${DIR}/$1".* "${DIR}/"default.* ; do
	test -x $I && $I $1
done
Note that a single event can not only cause one hotplug event for many devices
but also _multiple_ events for every device. E.g. enabling a dasd devices
will cause hotplug to be called for the local subchannel devices as well as
the actual (remote) disk. Maybe someone adds hotplug calls for partitions
and logical volumes.
Since dasds are usually not larger than 2GB, you are quite likely
to enable many at the same time. Imagine you get 500 disks * 4 events * 10
agents in response to a single user command...
