Yes, it probably does, but if you do, you get all .o files in the new
tree into your diff. This way I get to selectively say which files
need to be diffed. 
Yes, this puts the burdon on me to create the list of files that are
new..... Your approach has some advantages, as indeed I sometimes
forget one or two new files.....
