If it was instant it shouldn't matter. I'm aware of that in theory, but
there
have certainly been reports of pthread_join taking quite a while happening
in
a sort of lazy/sloppy way. I don't know why this is the case but I wondered
if it was showing up here.
I've looked through the detailed run results and found this:
Thread DS 0, TID = 7646
Thread DS 0, TID = 7645
Thread DS 1, TID = 7648
Thread DS 1, TID = 7650
Thread DS 2, TID = 7651
Thread DS 2, TID = 7652
Thread DS 3, TID = 7653
Thread DS 3, TID = 7654
Main exit ...
real 23.25
As you can see except the first 2 threads all finished in order they were
created. With the average being at about 16.5 this is a high result and
thread order was almost ideal.
Cheers,
Con
