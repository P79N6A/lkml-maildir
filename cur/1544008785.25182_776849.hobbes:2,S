This could be a simple if (dm->type == 0xda), it looks like the switch
is abused as documentation.

Could these bit numbers be defines with declarative names, e.g define
DELL_WIFI_BLOCKED (1<<17)? It would make reading the code that just uses
plain numbers easier.

sizeof(buffer)
Likewise for other sizeof() occurrences that follow.
