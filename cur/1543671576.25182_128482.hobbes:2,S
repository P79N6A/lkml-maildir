Hello,
I am trying to make a 2.4.20 kernel with 3c59x support.
My card is a:
3Com 3c900 Cyclone 10Mbps TPO 
card and it only works with the 3c59x-scyld module, I found with Debian Woody 
with a linux v2.2 kernel.
It does NOT work with the normal 3c59x module and as I am trying to make a 
2.4.20 kernel, it still doesn't work. I chose support for "Vortex/Boomerang" 
and normally my card would be supported I think.
Can someone help me with this?
Greetings,
Michiel Borkent
