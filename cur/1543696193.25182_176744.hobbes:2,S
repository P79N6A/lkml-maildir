I can't traceroute behind NAT firewall but I can ping it no problems:
root@student8:/#> ping linux.bkbits.net
linux.bkbits.net is alive
the problem is attempt to enter any repository there (linux-2.5, linux-2.4
or the third, I forgot) just times out.
Oh well, I have to try once more when I am back on my regular system.
thank you
