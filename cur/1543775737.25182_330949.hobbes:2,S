Perhaps the IDLE or IDLEIMMEDIATE commands imply a head parking, that
would make sense. As you say, you can hear a drive parking its head.
Here's a test case, it doesn't sound like it's parking the hard here.
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <sys/ioctl.h>
#include <linux/hdreg.h>
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
	char cmd[4] = { 0xe1, 0, 0, 0 };
	int fd;
	if (argc < 2) {
		printf("%s <dev>\n", argv[0]);
		return 1;
	}
	fd = open(argv[1], O_RDONLY);
	if (fd == -1) {
		perror("open");
		return 1;
	}
	if (ioctl(fd, HDIO_DRIVE_CMD, cmd))
		perror("ioctl");
	close(fd);
	return 0;
}
