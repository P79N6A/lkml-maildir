Well, the LOC thing is for the local apic timer, so while regular 
interrupts are indeed very skewed, both CPU's is nicely getting the local 
apic timer thing..
That said, the timer interrupt generally happens just a few hundred times 
a second, and if there's just a higher likelihood that it happens when the 
spinlock is taken, then half-a-second pauses could easily be just because 
even when the interrupt happens, it could be skewed to happen when the 
lock is held.
And that definitely is the case: the most expensive instruction _by_far_ 
in that loop is the actual locked instruction that acquires the lock 
(especially with the cache-line bouncing around), so an interrupt would be 
much more likely to happen right after that one rather than after the 
store that releases the lock, which can be buffered.
It can be quite interesting to look at instruction-level cycle profiling 
with oprofile, just to see where the costs are..
