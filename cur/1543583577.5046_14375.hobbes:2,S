But then you need SMP_CACHE_BYTES, not L1_CACHE_BYTES.
And 128 byte aligning the 32-byte kmalloc cache wastes too much memory
;-)
If the caller of kmem_cache_create really wants do avoid false sharing
he could set align to SMP_CACHE_BYTES. (e.g. for some per-cpu data
structures)

How? You've already noticed that noone in the linux kernel uses offset.
