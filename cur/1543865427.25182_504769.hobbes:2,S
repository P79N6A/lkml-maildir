As Matt Mackall said:
"So yes, if a user reports a bug that's attributable to a single bit 
memory error that's otherwise unreproduced and unexplained, it's totally 
reasonable to chalk it up to cosmic rays until some sort of pattern of 
reports emerges."
So I guess that the only way to figure out if this is indeed a one-off 
cosmic ray is to post it somewhere public in case someone else sees it?
As there is no APIC mailing list, I am posting to LKML - sorry for the 
line noise, feel free to tell me to post elsewhere (/dev/null?).
Here it is: on a Dual-Opteron Tyan board which is rebooting every hour 
to run some unit tests, I caught this -only once- at boot (partially 
copied by hand):
