I know I've attempted to use the same IBM hard drive on the HPT366
controller with little success.  I got hangups until I moved it back to the
secondary IDE controller.
Otherwise, with 2.4.8 I could print to my Lexmark E310 printer using USB
fine.
One thing I have noticed is that, with the 2.4 kernels, my system doesn't
like sharing IRQs as well as the 2.2 kernels.  So you may want to see what
devices share interrupts with your USB controller, and move the cards if
necessary.
