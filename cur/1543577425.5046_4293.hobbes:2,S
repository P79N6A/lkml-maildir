The problem with directories is that they don't always grow rapidly
like that.  Spool directories are perfect examples of directories
which grow sporadically over a long time, which is why we wanted
persistent preallocation.
The most common instance where that happens to regular files is the
case of log files, but those tend to be held open even while idle so
the preallocation persists anyway.
