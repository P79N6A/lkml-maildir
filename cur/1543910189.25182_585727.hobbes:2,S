This is just nit-picking.  You can draw the boundary of the "software
net stack" wherever you want, but I think Sean's point was just that
RDMA drivers already are part of Linux, and we all want them to get
better.

Same thing with TSO and LRO and who knows what else.  I know you're
going to make a distinction between "stateless" and "stateful"
offloads, but really it's just an arbitrary distinction between things
you like and things you don't.

It's ironic that you bring up firewalling.  I've had vendors of iWARP
hardware tell me they would *love* to work with the community to make
firewalling work better for RDMA connections.  But instead we get the
catch-22 of your changing arguments -- first, you won't even consider
changes that might help RDMA work better in the name of
maintainability; then you have to protect poor, ignorant users from
accidentally using RDMA because of some problem or another; and then
when someone tries to fix some of the problems you mention, it's back
to step one.
Obviously some decisions have been prejudged here, so I guess this
moves to the realm of politics.  I have plenty of interesting
technical stuff, so I'll leave it to the people with a horse in the
race to find ways to twist your arm.
