hm, tricky patch.  I can't see any holes in it.  The volatile variable is
awkward but should be OK on x86 and I can see the need for it.
There's a preposterous amount of inlining happening in this code.  Hence
your patch took the size of drivers/char/rtc.o from
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
   3657     540       8    4205    106d drivers/char/rtc.o
to
   5419     540       8    5967    174f drivers/char/rtc.o
Do you think you could take a look at uninlining everything sometime?
