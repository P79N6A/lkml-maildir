Hello,
I am running RedHat Wolverine (beta) with kernel 2.4.2.  I have a SCSI subsystem (AHA2740) with a Panasonic LF-D101 DVDRAM on it.
I read that the CDROM driver is built to recognize DVDRAMs and allow writes; well I can mount and read the UDF file system fine, but am not allowed writes.  I have UDF2.0 on the disk, because it didn't recognize UDF2.1.
Also, when I  make xconfig,  it includes UDF support, but read-only. (Write-Experimental is grayed-out)
In fstab: /dev/scd1 is mounted to /mnt/dvdram  udf  default 0 0. (paraphrasing)
I need the DVDRAM for backups and file transfers.  Is the problem the driver, the UDF filesystem, my setup, or what?
