Hi,
I have the same problem. But if I say my CD-RW is the cdrom all works as 
expected (/dev/scd1).
Also the capabilities aren't correct I think:
Jan 14 21:26:31 worf kernel: sr0: scsi3-mmc drive: 0x/0x writer cd/rw caddy
for my CDROM; it is a TEAC-CDROM without caddy, but tray and has a 
read-speed of 42. It is NOT a writer.
The writer seems to be recognized correctly (again a TEAC-CDRW):
Jan 14 21:26:31 worf kernel: sr1: scsi3-mmc drive: 24x/24x writer cd/rw 
xa/form2 cdda tray
Only the write-speed isn't correct (it can only write 8x not 24x)
As I have no time in the moment to dig this down further, I just write 
this for information.
Btw I'm using kernel 2.4.0 with reiserfs and NVIDIA patch.
Bye
