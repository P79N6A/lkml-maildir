Looks kinda similar to the Bulk Storage spec from their block diagram.
Could you plug in the device and get a descriptor dump from it? It'll
let us better figure out how difficult/easy it is to support.

The best way to learn the USB code is to look at the already existing
drivers. There is no documentation for it since the code was recently
developed (and is still in development).

It should be more like usb_scsi than anything else I would guess. Once
we get a descriptor dump, we'll have a better idea.

Doesn't sound completely unreasonable. It all depends on how comfortable
you feel with programming, the kernel and undocumented interfaces.
There's a mailing list for USB at linux-usb@suse.com. I suggest
subscribing since the biggest hurdle you'll most likely have is the USB
portion since it's the newest/least tested part of the code.
