NAK
The kernel drivers work on the basis that if you are using drivers/ide
then the IDE driver will grab all the ports, if you are using libata then
the PCI boot quirks will switch to split AHCI and PATA mode and the
libata drivers will take both. 
If you build both IDE and libata support for the same hardware into your
kernel it should generally end up with only one driver claiming the
hardware but the AHCI case doesn't handle this in 2.6.18.
