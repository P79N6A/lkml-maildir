Is this designed to replace sysctl?
In general we want to support using sysctl and similar features WITHOUT
procfs support at all (of any type).  Nice for embedded systems
especially.
sysctl may be ugly but it provides for a standard way of manipulating
kernel variables... sysctl(2) or via procfs or via /etc/sysctl.conf.
AFAICS your proposal, while nice and clean :), doesn't offer all the
features that sysctl presently does.
