That might work, though I'll be using the ACPI namespace to drive PCI
discovery soon (hacking the PROM now).  Maybe I should add some MADT and
_PRT entries while I'm at it?  The problem is that we don't support
IOAPIC or IOSAPIC interrupt models/hw registers.

That would work I guess.

We also use ACPI tables SLIT and SRAT for memory/proximity detection,
and fill in the proper FADT fields.
