The newest I could find:
linux-2.6.5-userdev.20040507.patch
Known problems:
	- The kernel internal psmouse driver should not be loaded when using
	  user space driver, otherwise the drivers may try to initialize the
	  device into incompatible state.
That's what I call 'cannot coexist with other kernel drivers'.
Coexisting would mean that when someone wants to open the raw device,
the serio layer would disconnect the psmouse driver, and give control to
the raw device instead. I believe that could work.
Anyway, looking at the patch, it's not bad, and it's quite close to what
I was considering to write. I'd like to keep it separate from the
serio.c file, although it's obvious it'll require to be linked to it
statically, because it needs hooks there - it cannot be a regular serio
driver.

It's indeed time for me to examine the SERIO_USERDEV patch, and I
should've examined it earlier than now, sorry for that, but I don't need
to test your userspace drivers, as I'm not interested in those.
