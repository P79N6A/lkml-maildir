It is racoon transport setup with ESP4 only ecryption with AES-128 CBC
mode.
Hardware.
FC4 vanilla kernel 2.6.16-1.2069_FC4smp runs on P3 3 Ghz with HT
enabled, 512 Mb of RAM, sk98lin gigabit ethernet.
Acrypto kernel runs on Xeon 2.4 Ghz with HT enabled with 1Gb of RAM 
and e1000 gigabit ethernet adapter (in pci-x slot).
HIFN card is old 7955 (it was quite challenging to bring it to Russia
when I started acrypto developemnt several years ago, so no new toys) 
in PCI-X slot.
When HIFN driver is not loaded, asynchronous SW crypto provider is
loaded for one processor.
Benchmark is scp (yes, it encrypt packets too to simulate some real work
on hosts) of big files over the gigabit link.

That would be good :)
