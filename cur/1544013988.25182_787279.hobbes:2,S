I'm pretty sure that I've done it on other systems from this buy, but on 
this system, no I don't have any working 64 bit system. I tried ubuntu 
8.10 and 8.04 before trying to use the config for my working 32 bit system 
as the basis for a make oldconfig to try and get a working 64 bit kernel 
to start using.

I just uploaded some snapshots of the bios screens
