Any of the above, eventually.  All I might know is that a block on disk
has changed, and yes, I see what you are on about.  I will know that the
changes are consistent from a file system point of view.  They will have
been caused by a file system operation in a remote computer miraculously
sharing the same underlying device.  There isn't a write mutex right
now, but there will be.  I'm just looking around to see if I can get
away without communicating higher-level info.
As a first approximation, say "contents of file". Your answer rather
leads me to suppose that that at least is possible. (Being a good idea
is another question).
Thanks for the response.
Peter
