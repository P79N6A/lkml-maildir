Find out which one is in that linksys possible-gpl-violation and use
that one.  (I think its broadcom.) 
FWIW I got my laptop with the broadcom (dell truemobile) intentionally,
as it is useful under XP and might eventually work under Linux.  (Then I
bought the older truemobile, the 1150 I think, for $80 or so. Swapped
right in, leaving the pcmcia slot for my ipaq's hdd, etc.  Even the
Fn-wireless button correctly turns the radio on/off, although Linux has
no way to detect it except loss of signal.)
