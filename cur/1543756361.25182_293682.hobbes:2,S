Hi, Ben.
How kind of you to remember.

Now I have a rewrite of the previous "clear/read_pci_errors" patch.
The new one adopts iomap infrastructure, considering generality,
capability and so on. And the part of its implementation for IA64 is
now under test using converted SCSI/NIC drivers.
Soon I'll post the patch to lkml(+IA64ML) with some explanation of the
change and the result of test, and will beg/hear comments.

Interesting.
Actually I don't have enough knowledge about platforms other than IA32/64,
so it will be helpful if you could tell me practical matters about ppc64
etc.

It goes slowly but steadily...
I'd also like to start the discussion about PCI error reporting again.
Thanks,
