Not at all :)
Your mail is just another proof why kref is a good abstraction :)
If you are the last user of a kref, (refcount = 1), then
you are sure that nobody else but you is using the object, and as we are 
kref_put() this object, the atomic_dec_and-test *will* set the count the 
object and you are going to release() object.
The release() function is not going to look at kref_count again, just free the 
resources and the object.
Maybe a change in the documentation is necessary to explain this point 
(release() can e called while the apparent krefcount is 1)
Or in kref_put doing this :
if (atomic_read(&kref->refcount) == 1) {
	atomic_set(&kref->refcount, 0);
	release(kref);
}
if (atomic_dec_and_test(&kref->refcount)) {
         release(kref);
         return 1;
}
