Hi all.
We are in trouble configuring an Adaptect AVA 1505
controller. We are using a RH 6.0 kernel 2.2.5 (just out of
the box). We both tried to pass the configuration parameters
on the fly (i.e. when inserting the module) and to hard wire
them (-DSETUP0=...) but with no success.
Since the day before the server was running on NT, and it
was fine with it, I wonder if upgrading to any 2.2.X could
be useful.
TYIA
