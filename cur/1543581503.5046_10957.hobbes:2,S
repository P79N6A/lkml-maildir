Hmm. df is not the kernel.
But df does a statfs system call, and something might be broken,
especially if you have an unusual filesystem type.
You might report on (i) what filesystem type lives on /dev/hda2?
(ii) what does "strace -e statfs df" say? What df outputs in the
"Size" column is the value of f_blocks.
Of course, if you write garbage to the size field of some superblock,
then the kernel will happily report it - there need not be a bug.
But now that you say "2.2.18 did not have this problem":
what is the 2.2.18 df output?
What is the "dmesg | grep hda" on both 2.4 and 2.2?
