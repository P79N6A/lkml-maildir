Hi,
In an earlier message 
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0304.2/0765.html
It was suggested that someone should set up a web page to track all
these dead hard drives that seem so common today.
Well, goto the link below and you can log your dead drive and view all
the other submissions. Yep it's all pretty basic just now and the data
is just stored in a CSV text file.
Anyways if you think this is useful head along to 
http://digital-domain.net/fscked-disk/
it doesn't really need much explaining ;).
Cheers,
Andrew Clayton
