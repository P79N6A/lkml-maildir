But, how are you going to make the sysfs attribute look generic so that 
application will not have to know whether to go
to /sys/.../mdps /sys/.../hdaps/ or /sys/.../whatever?
I'd probably prefer netlink, since this way it's something more generic 
and if some more functionality is added, you don't need to start
adding more sysfs attributes.
Sorry it took me a while to respond - I was too busy lately.
