Could be a useful addition, if only during debugging.
The idea iirc is that kernel should put it into a state
where userspace only needs to clear the 'successful boot' flag.
By the time we get to userspace, the parity should be correct also,
so you shouldn't need to hack sbf.c to chop that test out.

Dave.
