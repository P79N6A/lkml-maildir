I don't care either way.
If we say that the DMA api works on "DMA cacheline boundaries"
(and in reality it does) we do need to either:
1) Require that entire buffers are commited by call sites,
   and thus "embedding" DMA'd within non-DMA stuff isn't allowed
2) Add the __dma_cacheline_aligned tag.
But note that with #2 it could get quite ugly because the
alignment and size both have a minimum that needs to be
enforced, not just the alignment alone.  So either:
struct foo {
	unsigned int other_unrelated_stuff;
	struct object dma_thing __dma_cacheline_aligned;
	unsigned int more_nondma_stuff __dma_cacheline_aligned;
};
or:
struct foo {
	unsigned int other_unrelated_stuff;
	union {
		struct object dma_thing __dma_cacheline_aligned;
		char __pad[(sizeof(object) + DMA_CACHELINE_SIZE &
			   ~DMA_CACHELINE_SIZE)];
	} u;
	unsigned int more_nondma_stuff __dma_cacheline_aligned;
};
I hope you see what I'm trying to say.
