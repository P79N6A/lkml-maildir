And if you had actually cared to follow that thread with Roman Zippel to
its logical conclusion, you would have noticed that patches including an
update to match the coding style have been made available:

Care to comment on why? All what the above says is that this trace point
shouldn't be active on an SMP box. That's one of the very rare cases
(if not the only case) where such a build-condition is added. And if this
really is too much for the kernel crowd's stomach then it is easily remedied.
I would have thought you had something a little bit more substantial
to stand against LTT's inclusion.
