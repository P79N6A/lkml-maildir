Seems sane to me.  We'd need a definition in compiler-intel.h too.  I don't
know if ICC implements __attribute__((unused)) - probably it does.
I guess we can get by without any commentary describing __maybe_unused, but
I think __used would need one - it's pretty obscure.
+@cindex @code{used} attribute.
+@item used
+This attribute, attached to a function, means that code must be emitted
+for the function even if it appears that the function is not referenced.
+This is useful, for example, when the function is referenced only in
+inline assembly.
