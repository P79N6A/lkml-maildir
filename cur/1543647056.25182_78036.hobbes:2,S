whoa.  I've been asleep.  The 2.4 kernel _does_ return zero
if passed a zero segment count.
So we need to fix 2.5 to do that as well.  Sure, the spec
appears to allow either, but given that, we should preserve
the 2.4 behaviour.
Does that sound sane?    If so then we should unfix this fix
in LTP.  Sorry.
