In response to the many replies like this one, Oops.  Sorry about the huge
attachment.  I was guilty of trying to provide all the information someone
would need.  That's all.  I will not let that happen and require the
person to ask for more information in the future.
Sorry if the attitude above is rather sarcastic, but it is more polite
than most of the posts that I received.  Maybe setting a limit on the
message sizes in the majordomo server allowing someone to realize the
mistake would be a Good Thing (tm).  Obviously I didn't intend to swamp
everyone's email, just provide all the facts.

Apologies
