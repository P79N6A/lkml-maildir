Further on, in LTTng 0.5.113, I added the possibility to trace the location
where the printk happened. Within a huge amount of information, this kind of
data identification can be very useful.
Example of a printk as shown from the text dump of a trace :
kernel.printk_locate: 181.713815470 (/tmp/trace2/cpu_0),
  4357, 0, insmod, UNBRANDED, 4234, 0x0, SYSCALL,
  { file = "/home/compudj/repository/tests/kernel/test-printk.c",
    function = "init_module", line = 14, address = 0xf88eb000 }
kernel.printk: 181.713817590 (/tmp/trace2/cpu_0),
  4357, 0, insmod, UNBRANDED, 4234, 0x0, SYSCALL,
  { loglevel = 0, text = { printk message } }
Regards,
Mathieu
