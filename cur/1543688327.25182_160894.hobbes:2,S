I have a Soyo P4I875P motherboard that has a HPT372 chip with bios 2.344
The hard drive on the controller is a Maxtor DiamondMax Plus 9 200GB. I
have tested the drive on ICH5 and it does around 48-52MB/s but on HPT372
it does ~ 9MB/s. This still shows up on 2.6.0-test4-bk2 and did on 2.4.x
but I haven't tested on 2.4 for several weeks.

/dev/hdi:
 Timing buffer-cache reads:   4128 MB in  2.00 seconds = 2063.28 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  156 MB in  3.00 seconds =  51.99 MB/sec
