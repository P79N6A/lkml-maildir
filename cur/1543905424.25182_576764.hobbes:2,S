In terms of this whole patch, I should have been a little clearer about
it's meaning .. It represents code getting moved inside the -rt series..
For example the code above was originally in the,
preempt-realtime-core.patch and I moved it to the
preempt-realtime-i386.patch.
So I'm not actually adding any code.. I wasn't trying to put Ingo's code
up for evaluation either, since it's all still in development ..
