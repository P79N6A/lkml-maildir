   It's not a new idea but that doesn't make it a good one.  The idea
   of distributing the _same_ compiler but different versions is
   nutty.
Actually, this is common practice even in the commercial UNIX world
for kernel development.  I have seen several UNIX vendors who use a
specific version of a specific compiler for kernel development.  When
you want to build a kernel, you check out the kernel build kit, and
this is the compiler that gets used.
I honestly see nothing wrong with it.  There are different parts of
the compiler stressed by the kernel build as opposed to most userland
compilation, and furthermore the desired compiler stability/feature
ratio is different for each task.  So one way to solve these differing
needs is to simply use different compilers.
