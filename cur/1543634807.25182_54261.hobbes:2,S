In the physical device tree, what's wrong with setting the name to 
something simple, like 'iscsi0', etc. All you're looking for is 
a locally unique ID. 
You need a globally unique ID to do persitant attribute setting and 
restoration, including naming. When /sinb/hotplug gets a call to name the 
device, it can look up the GUID to determine what to name the device.
