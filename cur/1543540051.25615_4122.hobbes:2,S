   I like this one. It puts the thing in the same tree as the modules
   themselves, so it's self-contained. Let's _document_ it as a symlink, and
   make "make modules_install" do that part too (I don't use modules so I'd
   rather somebody else sent me the tested - likely one-liner - patch to do
   this).
You asked for it, you got it.....

P.S.  Vendors should test this against their kernel packaging tools,
which tend to do all sorts of non-standard stuff because they try to
build build multiple kernels and multiple sets of modules from a single
kernel source tree.
