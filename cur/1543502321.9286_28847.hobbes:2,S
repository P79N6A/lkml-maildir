I almost sent this comment before, but withheld because I wasn't sure I
knew what I was talking about.  I'm sure someone will correct me if I'm
wrong.
Wasn't there some discussion a while back when capabilities were being
discussed about putting the capabilities in the ELF header with some
tag or something that is supposed to be ignored if the app/loader does
not know about it?  I believe the arguments against that had to do with
security and how one would ensure someone couldn't modify the
executable to gain greater capabilities.  There may have also been some
discussion about backwards compatabilities and if it would work on
"old" systems.
Well, capabilities may have these problems but Icons certainly don't. 
There's no security attached to icons, so if someone mucks with it who
give a hoot.  We also don't need to worry about backwards
compatabilitiy because there CERTAINLY wasn't and of this resource fork
stuff in older version of Linux so the apps that may be written
to use them couldn't run on old systems anyway.
Is there any reason that this ELF header tag thigamajig would not work
for capabilities?  I don't really know what I'm talking about (and
admit it) but it may be something that people could agree on.
Let me know if I'm out of my mind and should just get some sleep.
