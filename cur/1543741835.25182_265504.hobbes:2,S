Nope, p4-clockmod is completely useles. It doesn't slow down the CPU
frequency, it only executes 7000 tick some kind of 'hlt' / 'halt'
instruction out of 8000 ticks (for example, to get 12.5%) just like
Linux's idle routine.
So you've got the _disadvantages_ of a slow clock (programs run
slower), and not the _advantages_ (power consumption is same as idle
CPU and not lower, temperature is same as idle CPU and not lower).
But why does the P4 have such a mode? It uses this mode during thermal
throttling to get to the 'idle' temperature.
Therefore, p4-clockmod is completely misnamed: it's _not_ a cpufreq
driver in the sense that it does not change the frequency. The
documentation should be updated to reflect this (eventually).
In short: p4-clockmod can be emulated in software.
