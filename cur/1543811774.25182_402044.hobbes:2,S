Yeah, I think that Bryan just wrote something different than what he
meant: there is no desire for wc_wmb() to make sure that writes via a
write-combining mapping have gone all the way to the device, any more
than a normal wmb() makes sure normal writes have gone all the way to
the device.  All that wc_wmb() needs to do is make sure that writes
via a write-combining mapping don't get passed by later writes.
This does speak to the need for precise documentation though :)
