As I've already said elsewhere, does anything say that "reset" means
that UTF-8 is turned off, or merely reset back to some known state? I
personally would consider that UTF-8 being on is the default, and if
something wants it off it should ask specifically..
Consider any other terminal emulator, such as those running on X11; when
they're reset, they know to keep UTF-8 mode turned on, because it said
so in their config, or in the locale. Kernel doesn't really have nice
access to the LANG environment variable, but we can give it something
similar; namely, via a module parameter.
