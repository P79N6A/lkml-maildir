This is a Linux-Kernel development list, it's not for end-user support
other than with kernel development. You're not a kernel developer, you
would not be asking such questions if you were. 
There is a self-contained list for NFS v3. Check
http://sourceforge.net/project/?group_id=14
And there's Red Hat that sell support.
And before doing anything else, get a properly fixed kernel. Don't stick
with 2.2.14. Check with Red Hat Errata for details.
