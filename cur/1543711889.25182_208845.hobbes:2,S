Of course I *am* against bootsplash. Unfortunately I've probably lost
that war already. But at least it is not in -linus tree (and that's
what I use anyway) => I gave up with bootsplash-equivalents, as long
as they don't come to linus.
[And I believe Linus would shoot down bootsplash-like code, anyway.]
