This might be the same as the problem discussed in the
thread
  "xine pauses with recent (not -ac) kernels"
(try searching the list archive).  The conclusion seemed
to be that since there was a workaround if you are
using raw io (doing a
         sleep 100000 < /dev/dvd-device &
in the background before starting xine), the fix could wait
for the 2.5 kernels.
I hope this helps,
Duncan.
