Can we avoid adding this please?
It should at least have been a CONFIG_foo thing, defined in arch/*/Kconfig.
But that still requires nasty ifdefs in the C code.  It would be very small
overhead just to require that all architectures implement
arch_kretprobe_blacklist[] (which can be renamed to kretprobe_blacklist[]).
 Architectures which don't need a blacklist can just have { { 0, 0 } }.
If the few bytes of overhead on non-x86 really offends then one could do
something like this:
in powerpc header file:
#define kretprobe_blacklist_size 0
in x86 header file:
extern const int kretprobe_blacklist_size;
in x86 C file:
const int kretprobe_blacklist_size = ARRAY_SIZE(kretprobe_blacklist);
and then this code:

can be put inside
	if (kretprobe_blacklist_size) {
		...
	}
so the compiler will remove it all for (say) powerpc.
There are lots of ways of doing it but code like this:

really isn't the sort of thing we like to see spreading through core kernel
code.
Have a think about it please, see what we can come up with?
