I never said, that the current implementation of CFS fits the criteria
of modularity, but it is a step in that direction. I'm well aware that
there is a bunch of things missing and it has hard coded leftovers,
which are related to the current two hard coded policy classes.

Ack. I don't worry much whether the CFS policy is better than the SD
one. I'm all for a truly modular design. SD and SCHED_FAIR are good
proofs for it.
