I've seen this too, it doesn't have anything to do with bonding, it's the
fact that you are sending packets out several interfaces at once that's
the cause. Same thing happend to me when transmitting at high speeds on
two interfaces at once without bonding. And you are using 4 interfaces so
I can imagine that it will be even worse than I saw.
And bonding on my two eepro100 in another machine works perfectly,
no problem maxing out at aproximatly 200Mbit.

Linux hackers are funny people: They count the time in patchlevels.
