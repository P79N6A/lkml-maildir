Well, maybe it's not the answer, but it's working for me with
2.5.67-mm3. Besides being too verbose, I have tried booting with the
card plugged, booting with the card unplugged and then plugging it, and
plugging/unplugging it several time to check that hotplug is working.
Haven't found any problems, although I'm testing right now on my main
system (my everyday use laptop).
Nice work, Russell :-)
