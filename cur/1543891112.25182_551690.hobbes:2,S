hdparm in the other identify mode does list the UDMA3/4 modes twice
[1], which looks odd.

Seems less likely, as the Extreme IV reader (and another) supports
UDMA mode 4; in PIO mode 6, they apparently top out at 17MB/s [2],
which seems reasonable.

100MB transfers still achieve 32MB/s:
# dd if=/dev/sdb of=/dev/null bs=100000k count=10
10+0 records in
10+0 records out
1024000000 bytes (1.0 GB) copied, 31.9328 seconds, 32.1 MB/s
> Also, just for fun, you could try "hdparm --direct -t /dev/sdb"
# hdparm --direct -t /dev/sdb
/dev/sdb:
 Timing O_DIRECT disk reads:   96 MB in  3.05 seconds =  31.47 MB/sec
It is conceivable that the controller in the two particular readers
which get 40MB/s are doing some kind of prefetching, but seems seems
like an extreme gain.
I'll check things out with the IDE PIIX code also. Thanks for your help!
