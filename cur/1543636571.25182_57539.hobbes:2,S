That was really a very different patch.  The hang up has
been time to work on the code.  There are a few, minor,
changes, like eliminating nanosleep() (it should call
clock_nanosleep()), and then the code clean up to remove all
the debug cruft.  
The next bit I want to submit is the changes to the timer
queue to allow subjiffie timers...
I am hoping to convince my boss to allow me to work on this
full time so I can make some real progress.  As always, any
help will be gratefully accepted :)
