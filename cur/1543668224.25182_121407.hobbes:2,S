No, this is wrong. spinlock debugging never forces an oops, it just 
complains with printk and tries to continue.
What happened is that someone registered a timer, and then kfreed the 
timer while it was still active. Then the call from run_timers() caused 
a crash, which corrupted the spinlock state, which provoked a spinlock 
debugging message.
Shawn: If you want to debug this, then you should try to print the "last 
user" field of the slab object that contains the timer. Add a test into 
run_timers that checks if timer->function is < 0xC0000000.
Something like
    kmem_cache_t *c = GET_PAGE_CACHE(virt_to_page(timer));
    struct slab *slabp = GET_PAGE_SLAB(virt_to_page(timer));
    void * obj = slabp->s_mem+c->objsize*((timer-slabp->s_mem)/c->objsize);
    unsigned long last_user = *(unsigned 
long*)(obj+c->objsize-BYTE_PER_WORD);
finds address of the last caller of kfree() or kmem_cache_free() on the 
slab object. It only works if slab debugging is enabled. Just print 
last_user, and look it up in System.map. Or use print_symbol (see 
mm/slab.c for an example).
If you need help I can write a patch.
