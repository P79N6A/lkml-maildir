Well, let's cut through the B.S. ;-)
* Even when the SATA core is updated to support NCQ, nForce will not
support it under Linux.  No hardware info.
* "hardware firewall" -- sounds silly.  Pretty sure Linux doesn't support
it in any case.
* overclocking -- overclockers are always playing with fire.  any
overclocked hardware is suspect and unsupportable.
* via comes with gigabit lan these days.  My own VIA-based Athlon64
system comes with r8169 gigabit.
