Hello,
tcp_vegas produces division by zero kernel oopses in dom0 when running
a Xen-patched 2.6.16.28 kernel. I have tracked down the problem to
line #256 in tcp_vegas.c: presumably due to flaky Xen timing, the rtt
seems to get zero from time to time (adding 1 to the rtt variable
solves the problem for me). The same should apply to line #140 in
tcp_veno.c, too.
Best regards,
Mark
