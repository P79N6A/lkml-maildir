This might also be a nice idea to keep in mind when creating a
linux-hardware web site; What kind of info we need to support hardware.
Perhaps it is possible to maintain a list of missing info on hardware
pieces. We all the info is collected we turn over the info to the actual
kernel developers. Might even save the developers some time?
