I remember I read an argument against this a long time ago, but I
don't remember where. I think it was some arbitrary decision that
people using more than X ARP entries will need arpd. Most probably
the code path in the ARP updates is/was not much optimized to handle
large number of entries. Think about cable operators who may have
10-20000 entries !

The "server" ones are not necessarily more robust, often they are faster.

That's often how linux penetrates the enterprise ;-)
