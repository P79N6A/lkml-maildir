There are not a lot of them:
drivers/s390/net/ctcmain.c
drivers/s390/net/netiucv.c
drivers/net/irda/vlsi_ir.c
drivers/net/tun.c
>From netiuvc.c:
  /*
   * Since receiving is always initiated from a tasklet (in iucv.c),
   * we must use netif_rx_ni() instead of netif_rx()
   */
This implies that the author thought it was a matter of correctness to
use netif_rx_ni vs. netif_rx.  But it looks like the only difference is
that the former sacrifices preempt-safety for performance.
I could not find maintainers for the two s390 drivers, or a specific
maintainer for vlsi_ir.
