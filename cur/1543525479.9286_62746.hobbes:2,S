Subject: Question on porting proc-fs code from 2.2 to 2.3.

Could someone point me to some info of some kind on how to port
my 2.2 proc fs code for the VLAN devices to however it's being
done in 2.3?
If not, any particularly clean implementation in the kernel that
would be a good choice to learn from?
Thanks,
Ben
