ok, i think i have managed to fix both bugs. I have released -rt3, 
please re-check whether it works any better. If it still doesnt then 
please send me the exact .config that fails.

btw., latest SMP kernels (2.6.18 and later) "patch themselves back" to 
UP instructions to a high degree if they run on a single CPU - that's 
why for example Fedora uses only an SMP kernel these days. Running a 
genuine UP kernel is still more efficient - but the difference shouldnt 
be /that/ large anymore. (if someone would like to measure it that would 
be interesting to see)

hm, this is a -rt specific thing that i hoped to have worked around but 
apparently not. The ACPI code uses a waitqueue in its idle routine 
(argh!) which cannot by done sanely on PREEMPT_RT. In -rt3 i've added a 
more conservative (but still ugly and incorrect) hack - could you try 
it, does -rt3 work any better?
