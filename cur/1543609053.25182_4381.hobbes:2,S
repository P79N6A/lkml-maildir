Hi list,
I have a 3c980 NIC plugged into an Abit KT7-RAID and connected together
with a WOL cable. I can't seem to get WOL to work using the ether-wake
utility if I power the box down with shutdown(8). The only way I can
currently get WOL to work is if I reboot the box, then physically press
the power button to turn it off.
I'm loading the 3c59x.o driver using the enable_wol option, but I'm not
currently using ACPI. Looking through the 3c59x.c code, I notice it relies
on the box being put into a certain ACPI state. Will the ACPI code do this
on shutdown?
Cheers
Matt
