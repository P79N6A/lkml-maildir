I currently only have a 6 GB FAT32 partition, you can read things like
"MSWIN4.1", and "FAT32" in the first 100 bytes. If it doesn't contain
those, I doubt it's formatted. If it's not formatted, it's pretty normal
that you can't mount it, and get an error like that.

It could be formatted using different block size, I think there is some
option you can give somewhere, but I forgot.

Someone that has some disk he can play with can format a partition with a
fs bigger then 8 GB? (or different blocksize then 4K)
I agree that it's probably something easy to fix if it's just the cluster
size the kernel doesn't like.
