well, no-napi shouldn't fail any worse than napi, so that may well be
a driver bug.  Lets follow up offline or at mailing list e1000-devel %
lists.sf.net
otherwise no idea.  There are a lot of people using these boards
without issues, it seems that ABIT even has some of this same board
that work for some people.  If you can find someone that has one that
works you might try comparing your ethtool -e output to theirs. If you
change your eeprom however, thats you taking risks on your own, and we
can't support you.  But it might be a useful thing to know, to give
more information to ABIT.
