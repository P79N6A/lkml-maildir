To whom may concern
We had a Linux Kernel Dump Summit 2005.
The participants are
Dump tools Session
diskdump -- Fujitsu
mkdump   -- NTT Data Intellilink
LTD      -- Hitachi
kdump    -- Turbolinux
Summary  -- Miracle Linux
Dump Analysis tools Session
Alicia/crash -- Uniadex
Other participants are
VA Linux/NEC/NSSOL/IPA/OSDL/Toshiba
Some discussion topics are (but not limited to)
- What kind of information do we need?
    trace information
    all of registers
    the last log of panic, oops
    LTD (Linux Tough Dump) has some nice features
- We need a partial dump
- We have to minimize the down time
- We have to dump all memory
    how can we distinguish from the kernel and user if
    kernel data is corrupted
- How we are not able to dump data
    device
    power management
    we need a generic mechanism to reset a device
- Hang
    NMI watch dog
    mount
- It is very difficult to debug a memory corrupt bug
- hardware error
- Where will we go to?
   IHV and Linux Kernel community collaboration are needed
Dump Analysis tools are very important
- There is a concern that the development process of 'crash'
is not open.
- Do we have to extend gdb?
- We'd like to collaborate 'crash'
- kexec/kdump, mkdump, LTD, all of them use the second kernel
to dump it.
- We have to share the test data, check list, test tools of
dump tool developments.
We agree to have the Linux Kernel Dump Summit.
Regards,
  Hiro
