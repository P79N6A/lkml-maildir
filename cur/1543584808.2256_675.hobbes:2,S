Subject: Lockup after IDE setup

I have the following problem that has completely
stumped me. I have tried searching the Mailing list
archives, but have found nothing. I am not subscribed
to the list, so I would ask that I be CCed
(stempbm@yahoo.com) on the responses to this message.
I have a Dell Dimension XPS Pro200n Pentium Pro 200Mhz
computer with a Promise PDC 20246 (Ultra/33) PCI card
running a Quantum FireBall LP 13Gig drive. Everything
was running fine under 2.2.13 Mandrake 6.0. I decided
to upgrade to Mandrake 7.2 and the Kernel locks up as
soon as the IDE stuff is initialized. So, I tried 7.1
which booted, upgraded, and then I had the same
problem
on reboot with the new kernel from the CD-ROM. I next
downloaded the 2.4.0 kernel and recompiled from
scratch. I have tried to keep most anything "strange"
out of the IDE settings. I do have an IDE tape and IDE
CD-RW on the 2 internal IDE controller ports. I also
made sure support for the Promise card was compiled
in. So, here is the output from the screen. Once the
last line is displayed nothing more happens. I have
tried disabling the internal IDE controller, but that
does not help.
Uniform Multi-Platform E-IDE driver Revision: 6.31

ide1: at 0x170-0x177, 0x376 on irq 15
ide2: at 0xfff0-oxfff7, 0xffe6 on irq 10
During the upgrade I switched to a console and used
fdisk to lookup my partitions. Here are the results of
the partition table list. 
Partition 1 does not end on a cylinder boundary
phys = (2,254,63) should be (2,15,63)
Partition 2 does not end on a cylinder boundary
phys = (264,254,63) should be (264,15,63)
Partition 3 does not end on a cylinder boundary
phys = (1023,254,63) should be (1023,15,63)
Partitions 1 and 2 are primary, 16Meg and 2Gig
respectively. Partition 3 is my extended partition
that contains all my Linux Logical partitions (expect
/boot with is Partition 1). 
When I use fdisk after booting with my old 2.2.13
kernel, I do not get these messages. I suspect the
partition problem to be related to, if not the cause
of, the problem. Since I will have to re-install
everything to fix it, I would like to know if I am
correct, or if something else is wrong.
Thanks!
