Maybe it should be answered by a lawyer,
but it's better to protect our freedom because
law is very 'variable'.

This is not a duplicate, it's only an advertisement.
Long time ago Torvalds wrote at COPYING:
"[...]
Also note that the only valid version of the GPL as far as the kernel
is concerned is _this_ particular version of the license (ie v2, not
v2.2 or v3.x or whatever), unless explicitly otherwise stated.
[...]"
what does MODULE_LICENSE("GPL") mean at tg3.c ?
GPL 1.0 ?
GPL 2 ?
any GPL ?
only 'GPL' ?
Is possible to write BSD or BSD/GPL or GPLv2 or GPL drivers/code
*inside* Linux kernel ?
