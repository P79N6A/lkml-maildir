Hmm, I made a mistake in my maths somewhere, and some of those values
are incorrect, so having the compiler do the work would have stopped
me screwing up, but once the correct values are used, I doubt there's
ever a really compelling reason to change the slab poison pattern.

In case where we detect a single bit has been flipped, we spew
the usual slab corruption message, which users instantly think
is a kernel bug.  In a lot of cases, single bit errors are
down to bad memory, or other hardware failure.
This patch adds an extra line to the slab debug messages
in those cases, in the hope that users will try memtest before
they report a bug.

Single bit error detected. Possibly bad RAM. Run memtest86.
