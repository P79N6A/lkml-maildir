You mean:
Module                  Size  Used by
...
scsi_transport_spi     20864  1 sym53c8xx
scsi_mod              131304  7 st,sr_mod,sg,sym53c8xx,scsi_transport_spi,libata,sd_mod
...
autoloaded on boot, and scsi_mod has verbose sense strings built in
(call it bloat, but on a Peeceeh a few kB don't hurt).
libata is Linux's SATA driver, still under development but quite solid
for some chips, such as via 82*. Chances are that adding PATA to libata
(which is planned or in the works) obsoletes your whole ATAPI ide-* module
arguments, sym53c8xx - no surprise - the host adaptor driver, sr/sd_mod
the CD-ROM and disk block drivers, st and sg tape and generic drivers.

You've been stating this oft enough now. It won't change in a day even
if you post this every hour. Please cease posting the same stuff over
and over again.
