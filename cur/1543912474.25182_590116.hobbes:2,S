Subject: recent nfs change causes autofs regression

I am re-sending this after help from Ian and git-bisect. To me it's a
show-stopper: I cannot find an acceptable workaround that I can implement.
The problem: upgrading to 2.6.23-rc4 from 2.6.22 causes several autofs
mounts to fail silently - they just not appear when they should.
I believe it's caused by the NFS change that forces multiple mounts from
different directories under the same server side filesystem to have the same
mount options by default, otherwise it returns EBUSY.
For example, if server has a filesystem /a, and it exports /a/x and /a/y
(maybe with rw or ro), and a client must mount /a/x and /a/y with the same
mount options now.
Since in my setup they are managed by autofs, and the autofs map is managed
by nis, there is no way I could easily workaround it..
If we have to live with this regression, I want to hear some suggestions
about how to fix them realistically. Thanks.
By the way, I am not sure if I did the bisect right, but FWIW, git-bisect
says:

Subject: regression of autofs for current git?
Hi,
I am wondering if this is a known issue, but I just built the current git
and several autofs mounts mysteriously disappeared. Restarting autofs could
fix some, but then lose others. 2.6.22 was fine.
Is there anything I could check other than bisect? (It may take some time
for me to get to it)
Thanks for your help.
Hua
