Hi.  I am having a terrible time compiling 2.5.21 -- first some
missing includes which I think I have fixed and now at the very end
of the process after the modules have been installed I get the
following:
make[1]: Entering directory `/usr/src/linux-2.5.21/arch/i386/boot'
gcc -E  -D__BIG_KERNEL__ -traditional -DSVGA_MODE=NORMAL_VGA -DRAMDISK=512 bootsect.S -o bbootsect.s
as -o bbootsect.o bbootsect.s
ld -m elf_i386 -Ttext 0x0 -s --oformat binary bbootsect.o -o bbootsect
make[1]: *** No rule to make target `/usr/src/linux-2.5.21/include/linux/compile.h', needed by `bsetup.s'.  Stop.
Any help would be appreciated with this.
