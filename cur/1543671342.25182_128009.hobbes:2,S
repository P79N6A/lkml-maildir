Yes. You won't get a continuous sbrk/brk heap then anymore. Not sure it is a 
big problem though.
But apparently Solaris/x86 is doing that.
It's probably worth a sysctl at least.

You could, but I bet it would break some programs
(e.g. just moving __PAGE_OFFSET on amd64 to 4GB for 32bit broke some things)
