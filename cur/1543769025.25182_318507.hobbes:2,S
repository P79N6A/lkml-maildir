A 8-way set associative 1M cache is guaranteed to go at l2 speed only
up to 128K (no matter what the kernel does), but even if the secret
payload is larger than 128K as long as the load is still distributed
evenly at each pass for each page, there's not going to be any covert
channel, simply the process will run slower than it could if it had a
better page coloring.
So I don't see the need of kernel support, all it needs to do is to know
the page size, and that's provided to userland already.
