I've tried the variations I can think of---putting the line:
   install net-pf-10 /bin/true
in /lib/modules/modprobe.conf via update-modules, or directly by hand-editing.
Then depmod; then reboot. Also:
   install net-pf-10-* /bin/true
   install net-pf-* /bin/true
All variations still lead to:
Jan 31 23:08:01 ohlone kernel: request_module: failed /sbin/modprobe -- net-pf-10. error = 256
Jan 31 23:23:01 ohlone kernel: request_module: failed /sbin/modprobe -- net-pf-10. error = 256
on each run of exim from cron (Debian exim has ipv6 support compiled
in). If I run modprobe manually, I get:
   ohlone#  modprobe net-pf-10
   FATAL: Module ipv6 not found.
indicating that modprobe knows about the alias, but is not running
/bin/true when requested to load the module.
However: if I manually edit /etc/modprobe.d/aliases (which you're not
supposed to do), so as to comment out:
  # alias net-pf-10 ipv6
and then add:
  install ipv6 /bin/true
(update-modules; depmod; reboot), `modprobe ipv6' from the
command-line completes silently and without error (but without loading
the module, of course, since it doesn't exist). Which I think is the
expected behaviour.
But even at that point, in the logs we still get:
Feb  1 00:53:01 ohlone /USR/SBIN/CRON[280]: (mail) CMD (  if [ -x /usr/lib/exim/exim3 -a -f /etc/exim/exim.conf ]; then /usr/lib/exim/exim3 -q ; fi)
Feb  1 00:53:01 ohlone kernel: request_module: failed /sbin/modprobe -- net-pf-10. error = 256
(because exim is trying to load the module under the name net-pf-10??)
Here are some pointers to what seems to be the same or a similar problem:

Oh well, it is a very small problem (all it does is clutter the
log-files). Thanks very much to all who helped,
Jim
