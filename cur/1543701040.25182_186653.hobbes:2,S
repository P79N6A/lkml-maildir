I have it happening on both my optical drives. One is a lite-on ATAPI cd-rw, the
other an ATAPI Pioneer dvd-rw/cd-rw.  No fam/gnome running. I do use automount
with these drives, but I can see that the mounts have been expired, yet I can't
eject them using the button. Tested last night using both ide-cd and ide-scsi.
Same result with either access. When they're locked, fuser shows nothing
attached, as does lsof. I can eject them with the eject command.
