It seems jbd_debug() might need modification:
fs/ext4/inode.c: In function ‘ext4_write_inode’:
fs/ext4/inode.c:2906: warning: comparison is always true due to limited 
range of data type
fs/jbd2/recovery.c: In function ‘jbd2_journal_recover’:
fs/jbd2/recovery.c:254: warning: comparison is always true due to 
limited range of data type
fs/jbd2/recovery.c:257: warning: comparison is always true due to 
limited range of data type
fs/jbd2/recovery.c: In function ‘jbd2_journal_skip_recovery’:
fs/jbd2/recovery.c:301: warning: comparison is always true due to 
limited range of data type
I'm surprised this was not noticed in a test build before pushing upstream.
