I made that change, and I thought about letting the caller check it, but
this was a much cleaner way to fix it overall given that it needed to go 
in the 2.4 stable series. Actually, the caller having to check driver
details is not very nice at all. It has to do this for the dmaproc because
the DMA and PIO modes are fundamentally different, but in this case it's
probably better if the caller does not have to bother.
Now, what is lacking in the current implementation is that the caller
should use the hw ptr directly instead of first calling the ide_xx_data
which subsequently checks for an override, and ide_xx_data could be put as
default in that ptr. But that would require changing in a lot of places in
a very mission critical piece of code - it can be fixed during 2.5 of
course.

In what way, exactly, does the current mechanism stop you from doing this?
