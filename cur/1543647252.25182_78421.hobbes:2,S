In this case capable() call has been made from a kernel module. I think a
module doesn't have a PID? Should I check capabilites of program that does
a ioctl() call that will cause module to do capable() checking?
Process that does ioctl() call is owned by root and has following 
capabilities:
CapInh: 0000000000000000
CapPrm: 00000000fffffeff
CapEff: 00000000fffffeff
 
I think there are at least CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability.
