First of all I will try to gather all the data necessary for the device
handling my major into a single struct. Thereafter I will collapse
all the minor stuff into a "sub structure" and so on.
Then I will replace all the direct refferences by proper
access/setup methods, then one can start to try to remove
all those kdev_t by pointers to this stuff bottom up... 
However I will just go read through the comments you mention.
