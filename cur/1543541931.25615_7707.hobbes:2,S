Note it should be 
* ^TOlinux-kernel@vger\.redhat\.com
since procmail uses egrep-style regexp matching there.
Note also that if your MTA and MDA support address extensions, you
better have your mail delivered to an extended address such as
user+lk@your.example.com
(qmail uses - instead of + by default).
Check with your _LOCAL_ mail administrator for details.
