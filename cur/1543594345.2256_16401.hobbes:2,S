I apologize to all for my first post!
To partly answer my own poorly documented problem:-
First, once the code added for the debugger (int3) was removed from
the driver, the driver worked fine with kernel version 2.4.2-ac28 (but
still not with 2.4.2-2rh or 2.4.2).
Second, with sincere apologies to all (some suffer from brain
lapses more than others), I neglected to mention that the system
hangs, in both 2.4.2-2rh and 2.4.2 kernels, when the driver
performs:
    ...
    save_flags(flags);
    cli();
    ...
    TimeRemain = interruptible_sleep_on_timeout(&pEvent->WaitQue,
WaitTime);
    restore_flags(flags);
    ...
Again note that there were not any code changes to the driver,
with the results that the driver worked for 2.4.0 and 2.4.2-ac28
but did not work for 2.4.2-2rh or 2.4.2.
Does anyone know if there was a bug introduced between 2.4.0 and 2.4.2
in the interruptible sleep area that was fixed by 2.4.2-ac28?
If not, then there might still be a timing related problem in our
driver (or possibly the kernel).
Thanks again,
Dan Davidson
