syscall performance is something the other 99.99% of users not using the
feature will care about however. 
One of the things that you can sensibly do I think which will also avoid
a performance hit is to use the same kernel path as strace and friends
do for syscall tracing but capture and verify the syscall in kernel mode
rather than trapping back out. That will at least keep the usual fast
path unharmed by the security toys.
