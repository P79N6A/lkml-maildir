So why not replace it by mask_ack_irq() ?

Your patch would result in default_disable() when no shutdown function
is provided. default_disable() does the delayed disable thing, while you
remove the handler. The next event on that line will cause a spurious
IRQ.

Fair enough.

Agreed, it just depends on how they get fixed.

Agreed. Nothing is using this currently.

The remaining question is whether mask_ack_irq() or shutdown() is the
correct approach. Your patch would make it mandatory to implement
shutdown at least for such removable stuff.
I'm not sure about that right now as I'm too tired.
