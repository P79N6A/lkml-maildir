I want to turn a Linux box into a Multicast router running IGMPv3 and 
PIM-Sparse-Mode.
I have only managed to find linux support for Multicast host mode.
I.e. support for a Multicast Client application.
Is there any support for turning linux into a multicast router.
I have looked at mrouted, but it does not support IGMPv3. It only 
supports IGMPv1/2.
Kind regards
James.
