There is no way to open files within the kernel. Any attempt is
just a hack. The kernel is designed to perform tasks on behalf
of the caller. It doesn't have a context. It uses the caller's
context. A file-descriptor is a number that relates to the
current context. i.e., STDIN_FILENO is __different__ for you
and somebody else, even though it has the same numerical value.
To open a file in the kernel requires either a task with a
context (like a kernel thread) or you have to steal the context
of somebody which can destroy some innocent task's context.
You are never supposed to use files inside the kernel; period!
If you need to obtain file-data for a driver or receive file-
data from a driver, we have read(), write(), mmap(), and ioctl()
to accomplish these things from user-mode. A user-mode program can
write data directly to your driver using mmap(), for instance.
Or it can use a function-code you define to upload/download data
using ioctl().
This is a FAQ. Many persons have rejected this advice, only
to later on modify their drivers to correspond to the correct
way of writing Unix/Linux device drivers. This, after they've
trashed many innocent tasks.
