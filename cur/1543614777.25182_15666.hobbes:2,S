You can't, the scheduler is changed.
Try this, in sys_sched_yield() remove :
        spin_lock_irq(&runqueue_lock);
        move_last_runqueue(current);
        spin_unlock_irq(&runqueue_lock);
and replace it with :
        local_irq_disable();
        if (current->counter > 0)
            --current->counter;
        local_irq_enable();
