These aren't correct.  (Correct for the sentence you quoted, but not its
context).  I should have said: If you've got a partial read's worth of
data pending, you should return immediately -- without sleeping.

?? I don't understand.  This affects read() somehow?

You don't lose the event.  The syscall returns, the signal is delivered,
then the interrupted code continues with EINTR.  Or, if the signal is
blocked, it is queued (if RT) or made pending (non RT).

:-) Fair enough; I hope you can see that there is a way to reduce the
over-signalling without breaking applications.
