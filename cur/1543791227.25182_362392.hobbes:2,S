You mean the RCU-style update?  It will hang when a callout routine tries 
to deregister itself as it is running, although we could add a new 
unregister_self API to handle that.  Just check for num_callers equal to 1 
instead of 0.

Agreed.

Yes.
Note that on an SMP system you run the risk of starvation (the chain gets
called so frequently that it's _always_ running on some CPU).  We can
probably ignore that possibility.
Would you like to code up these ideas?
