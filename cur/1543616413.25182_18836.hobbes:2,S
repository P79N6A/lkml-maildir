No, you're wrong here.  That would violate the following provisions of
the C99 standard, because the two accesses to `a' would not have occurred.
(It would also violate similar provisions of the C89 and C++ standards.)
The "as if" rule -- which is stated in 5.1.2.3 [#3] in C99 -- is explicitly
defined to NOT allow optimizing away accesses to volatile objects.
