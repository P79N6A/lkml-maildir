TWAIN is an old attempt at an Apple standard, started in 1992.
It is a protocol for Scanners, Audio, and Camera controls, etc.
The last 'event' recorded by www.twain.org was in May of 2001,
supporting Mac OS X. It is an API, i.e., applicatons programming
Interface, not a protocol on the wire or related to hardware.
