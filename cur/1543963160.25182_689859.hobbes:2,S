As far as I can tell, authorship has been destroyed by at least two of the 
patches (ie Christoph seems to be the author, but Andrea seems to have 
dropped that fact).

Yeah, too late and no upside.
That "locking" code is also too ugly to live, at least without some 
serious arguments for why it has to be done that way. Sorting the locks? 
In a vmalloc'ed area?  And calling this something innocuous like 
"mm_lock()"? Hell no. 
That code needs some serious re-thinking.
