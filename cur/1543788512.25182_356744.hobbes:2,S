You cannot do anything else without getting into trouble over dentry
races. Given that choice, I prefer to take my chances with the mounts as
those are rare.
We can add locking in order to exclude the mount races, or we can just
ignore them. AFAICS there are 2 cases:
  1) umount races
	refcounting of any in-use dentry is supposed to prevent trouble here.
  2) mount races. Either
	Just ignore if the filesystem has already opened the file.
     or
	Add locking to prevent races.

...but I cannot do that once I get to dentry_open(). You are ignoring
the case of generic file open without creation.

Which again only deals with the case of open(O_CREAT). My point is that
the race exists for the case of generic open().
If you first lookup the dentry in open_namei(), then end up opening a
completely different file in dentry_open(), then you are fscked.
