Oops, sorry for the bad labeling.  The baseline I used was actually x86/mm.
(This was originally going to be just some x86_64 cleanups destined for
post-2.6.25, before I noticed that powerpc had issues.)

The only differences for that stuff should be to pass any new BTS requests
through to arch_ptrace as is done for e.g. PTRACE_GET_THREAD_AREA.  I'll
admit I tried not to think about that since it's disabled now and still in
so much flux.

It is a prerequisite for ptrace cleanups/fixes, yes.  The change does not
affect any signals code behavior.  It may also be useful for other generic
signals compat code later (though I haven't looked into that yet).  I'd
call it "compat-related" really.

Yes.

2/4 depends on 1/4 for powerpc64 to keep building.
3/4 depends on 2/4 for x86_64 kernel's 32-bit ptrace calls to keep working.
4/4 depends on 3/4 for same.
I've become fairly confused about the various trees and the state of the
ill-fated BTS code.  It's hard to figure out when it's coming and going
from where lately.  But resolving the actual code bits in any conflicts
with that will be trivial.
Thanks,
Roland
