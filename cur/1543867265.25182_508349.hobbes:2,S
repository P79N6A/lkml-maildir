I would just like to add that I belive that I have
made all the relevant adjustments from the feedback
from the previous two patches. If there is nothing
else from anyone, could this be merged in the current

We have several successful reports from users of the
previous patches on a variety of architectures
including SH4, PowerPC and ARM.
