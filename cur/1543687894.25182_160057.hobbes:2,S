Hrm, lsusb seems to have an endianess problem, the vendorid is garbled.

Doesn't really make sense to me. RS232 is specified electrically, the
adapter doesn't know which kind of device it is talking to. I'm using
mine to connect to a TTL-RS232 adapter which sits on a DSL-router, so
it's like a "null-link".

Why do you need this, don't you know what you set it to? :)
There are ioctls for it and probably a terminal program will know how to
read and write it.
