Menuconfig is fairly popular, and requires curses.. etc. etc.  There isn't
a configurator which doesn't require something more than gcc is there?
OTOH, python here says: Python 1.3 (Dec 19 1995)  [GCC 2.7.2]. I didn't
have it built at all during the years prior to 1995, so I'm sure you can
imagine how enthusiastic I am about upgrading that old turd ;-)
