Hi Fengguang,
 something really bad has happened between -rc3 and -rc6. Embarrassingly I did not catch that earlier :-(
 Compared to the numbers I posted in 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/10/26/208
 , dd1 is now at 60 MB/sec (slight plus), while dd2/dd3 suck the same way as in pre 2.6.24. The only test that is still good is mix3, which I attribute to the per-BDI stuff.
 At the moment I am frantically trying to find when things went down. I did run -rc8 and rc8+yourpatch. No difference to what I see with -rc6. Sorry that I cannot provide any input to your patch.
Depressed
Martin
