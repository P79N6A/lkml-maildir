The slab code _should_ be faulted for being ugly as hell, and much too
complex for it's uses. I've wanted to remove it several times completely,
going back to the older kmalloc(). I appreciate people looking into
removing features that are hardly ever used and of dubious value. 
I bet that 100% of the benefit of slab could be gotten with a really small
skb "cache" in front of a much simpler kmalloc() (where the skb cache
would be a few entries worth of pre-initialized skb's). Or alternatively
just keep sab, but separate the notion of allocation and caching - so that
the 99% that are _not_ interested in constructors would never have to go
through any parts that know about them.
