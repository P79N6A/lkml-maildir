Subject: PROBLEM: Total lockup with 2.3.12 (during heavy mmap activity)

Maybe someone's already aware of this, or perhaps it's fixed in 2.3.13-pre,
but I've not seen it mentioned (which doesn't mean it wasn't, of course)..
Err..
I was running tin compiled with electric fence - lots mmap()ing going on -
and got a total lockup, no response to pings, sysrq, nothing. Strangely
similar to what happened with that mmap / msync exploit someone posted
recently.
Of course, it could also be due to the horrible heat and a potentially dodgy
CPU fan, but the temperature alarms haven't gone off (yet).
What else might relevant? Kernel compiled with egcs-1.1.2, for UP. I'll
try with 2.3.13-preN and see what happens.

If it's tourist season, why can't we shoot them?
