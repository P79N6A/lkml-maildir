Yes, this is true.

Hmm, if you want to do this, then SCSI Core needs to know about:
	- Domain,
	- Domain device and
	- LU.
The reason, is that you do not know why a task timed out.
Is it the LU, is it the device, is it the domain?
(Those are concepts talked about in SAM.)
Since currently, SCSI Core has no clue about those concepts,
the current infrastructure, stalling IO to the host on eh,
satisfies.

No, no Patrick, I don't.  The SCSI Core does this for me, and then
calls my eh_strategy routine and all the commands are on the list.

No, it is actually pretty huge for a controller, and have to 
more than halve it and give that to SCSI Core.

Hmm, let me know if I'm missing something out.
