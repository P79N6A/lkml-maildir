I can't see this.  This code fragment is from cpia_do_ioctl.  This is
never called directly, the entry point is cpia_ioctl, which always passes
ioctl calls to video_usercopy (which calls cpia_do_ioctl through the
supplied function pointer).
In video_usercopy, it calls copy_from_user for an _IOW ioctl (which
VIDIOCSPICT is).  There is certainly no differentiation between the
different ioctl calls made by video_usercopy.
Is there something I have missed?
