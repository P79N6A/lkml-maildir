Agian - thinking outside the box.
If the permissions were don'e right in your own directories your 
inherited rights would give your permissions automatically to your home 
directory and all directories uner it. Netware has a concept called an 
inherited rights mask - something Linux lacks. Windows also has rights 
like this and Samba emulates it. So unless root put files in your 
directory and specifically denied you rights to them, you would have 
full rights to your own directory.
However - if you were browsing the /etc directory and there were files 
there that you had no read or write access to - then you wouldn't even 
be able to list them. If you went to the home directory and lets say 
everyone had 700 permissions on all the directories withing home, you 
would only see your own directory. You wouldn't even be able to know 
what other directories existed there.
If you want to start thinking about DOING IT RIGHT you need to think 
beyond the Unix model and start looking at Netware. Maybe in 5 years 
Linux will evolve to where Netware was in 1990.
Unix permissions totally suck but it's old baggage that you're stuck 
with somewhat. Are you going to be stuck forever and is Linux ever going 
to grow up and move on to better things? Linux is crippled when it comes 
to permissions. The Windows people are laughing at you and you don't 
even get it why they are laughing.
