Nah! Some programs just "try to seek" and if it works, will. 
dd if=/dev/zero count=200 | strace sox -t raw -r 44100 -s -w - -t wav - > /tmp/test
dd if=/dev/zero count=200 | sox -t raw -r 44100 -s -w - -t wav - | dd of=/tmp/test
sox: Length in output .wav header will be wrong since can't seek to fix it
