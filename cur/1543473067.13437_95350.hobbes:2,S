Addendum to the above: The switch to 80x25 mode occurs as follows:
In 80x60 mode:

 Q> Checking all file systems.
 Q> ----------------------------------
 Q> [/sbin/fsck.ext2] fsck.ext2 -a /dev/hda2
 Q> /dev/hda2: clean, 23/2784 files, 952/11088 blocks
 Q> ----------------------------------
 Q> Mounting local filesystems.
Switches to 80x25 mode here...
 Q> Turning on user and group quotas for local filesystems
 Q> Setting clock: Sat Dec 26 14:03:59 GMT 1998
 Q> Enabling swap space.
 Q> Initialising random number generator...

The relevant part of /etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit was...
 Q> # set the console font
 Q> if [ -x /sbin/setsysfont ]; then
 Q>     /sbin/setsysfont
 Q> fi
I've now commented that block out, and the system now sticks in the
80x60 font I selected at bootup.
Pierfrancesco: Many thanks for the suggestion. Although it wasn't
correct, it pointed me in the correct direction to fix the problem.
Alan: Maybe you could point this problem out to the boys at RedHat,
and get their comments thereon?
Best wishes from Riley.
