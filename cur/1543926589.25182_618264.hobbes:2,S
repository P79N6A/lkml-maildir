Steve,
   I'd forgotten about that package going away. I think I've been
building the interface forever in the kernel but then not actually
using it. I haven't loaded the realtime_lsm driver in a long time.
Certainly back in the 2.6.22 past somewhere since I stopped.
   Anyway, with that change to the config the rest of my old .config
file seems to have worked. The kernel boots. I have Jack running
realtime. No xruns in the few minutes I have left with this task
tonight.

   Very good so far. I'll continue to run the kernel over the next few
days and see how things go. Nothing I do these days is a heavy load.
Just desktop work with a little bit of audio but I still run the
realtime kernel.
   Great work!
Cheers,
Mark
