Hi Ted,
OK I think you are right, because this is a nice step towards developing 
an on-disk extent format for Ext4 that avoids committing design 
mistakes to permanent storage.  The benefit can be proven using a pure 
cache, in order to justify the considerable work necessary to make it 
persistent.
Chris and Jens have an effort going to implement a physical disk extent 
cache for loop.c.  It is actually the same problem, and I smell a 
library here.
Issue: how do you propose to make this cache evictable?
Regards,
Daniel
