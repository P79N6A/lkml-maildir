I don't really see what class of problems this would solve. It could be that we
mean different things with modular. Do you mean distribute the driver source
separately from the kernel source or do you mean going none monolitic by creating a
stable binary interface?? I think the second one is going to be hard to get pass
Linus and the first one is going to result in alot of drivers not uptodate with
kernel changes.
The problem with a binary interface is that if it was easy to do one we did not
need one in the first place as that would suggest that the source code interface
also was stable.

Good luck finding anyone doing this job. It's hard to make people write
documentation this is going to be impossible. This is a solution that works if you
can pay people but I don't think it's going to work when volunteers is doing it.

Yes but is anyone taking notes on what work really is taking up all the time? Is it
really drivers that is the problem? To me it lookes more like a problem with
deciding what really is the goal of every new version that make all sort of late
changes creap into the kernel that increase the time to a stable version. Making
the TODO list before instead of at the end would probably make people concentrate
on the same thing.
Just another thought.
