Well as a mildly technical 'user' who's been tracking the 2.6 series I
can't recall having to update _any_ userland packages due to kernel
changes. An example of this would be helpful.

As many here say. Too bad, we really don't care. Hardware providers
should have the requisite relationships with the distros and target
their management utilities to those. Surely no business using this sort
of high end hardware is running anything other than RHEL or SLES etc ?

See above.

Only kernel interfaces. And that's too bad for out of kernel modules.

If you want stable you want a distro 'enterprise' version.

In my experience this isn't the case.
