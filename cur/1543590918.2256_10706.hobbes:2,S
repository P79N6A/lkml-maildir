Just define a structure like:
struct user-to-kernel {
	unsigned int	uid;
	unsigned int	gid;
	...
}
and copy the header into your user space program. The alignments may
differ between different Linux architectures, but that won't matter.
You aren't going to be running a program compiled on a sparc on an i386
anyway...
If you are writing a filesystem or sending data over the network directly
via the kernel (without going through the user space program), then you
will need to decide upon a fixed byte order and alignment. (but this
doesn't seem to be the case for you, right?)
