Our commercial OSS drivers work perfectly with Linux 2.6.5, 2.6.6, 2.6.7
and they are failing to install with SuSE's 2.6.5 kernel. The reason is that
they have gone and changed the kernel headers which mean that nothing works.
For instance our kernel interface module doesn't compile anymore we see the following
errors:
> make -C /lib/modules/`uname -r`/build scripts scripts_basic include/linux/version.h

Why is this happening?. It's working fine with Linux 2.6.5 and also worked with
Linux 2.6.4 kernels from SuSE 9.1
