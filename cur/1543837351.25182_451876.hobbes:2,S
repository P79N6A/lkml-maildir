The kernel doesn't perform those, your distro's init scripts do that.  And 
various distros have various success at doing the right thing.  I've had 
the best luck with Debian and Ubuntu doing this in the right order.  RH 
seems to insist on turning off the network then network services such as 
sshd.

The kernel probably didn't do this, usually by the time the kernel gets to 
this point init has already sent kills to everything.  If it hasn't it 
points to problems with your init scripts, not the kernel.
