Hi,
	I almost sure Iknow why this happens,
		The problem is that both hpet clock source and hpet clockevents doesn't have a suspend/resume function
		On resume we should enable the main counter _and_ enable legacy replacement mode,
		On my system main counter in enabled, by I think by bios, but legacy replacement mode is not, so if
		a system doesn't use lapic as a tick source, but use hpet+broadcast, it will hang for sure on resume, and i tested it
		The patch below is a temporally fix, until clock-events and clocksources will get proper suspend/resume hooks:
		Regards,
			Maxim Levitsky
