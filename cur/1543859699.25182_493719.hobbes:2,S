But as it happens that driver does not work for a large segment
percentage of linux users who potentially could place the card in
their system.  Did that driver support all 23 architectures?

Every market is different, and you have to different things in
different markets.  It is close to incompetent not to acknowledge
the fact that rules are different in different markets and different
places.  That is one of the reasons why people try to harmonize laws
so there is not too much of this going on.
Usually it is also the case that binary vs source release does nothing
to a hardware manufacturers business model they sell hardware after
all, and usually having a helping hand in writing the necessary
software and making it work (the source release) is a plus for the
hardware manufacturer.
The difference is that we don't expect the hardware manufactures to do
anything we only hope they will support linux.  Once they support
linux we do expect they will play well with others and if they don't
then it is rude.
Please none of this amoral Neither is wrong crap.
