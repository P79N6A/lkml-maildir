Subject: [PATCH] atmel_spi: Fix handling of chipselect after SPI transfer
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2009/1/30/328

According to include/linux/spi/spi.h chipselect should stay active after a SPI
transfer or after a SPI message unless modified by
spi_transfer.cs_change != 0.
The current atmel driver passes this field to atmel_spi_msg_done as a
parameter with oppositional meaning: "cs_change" -> "stay" (see
atmel_spi_interrupt).
This patch fixes this behavoir by adapting the called function and its
callers. IMHO this solution is better than an one line fix of inverting the
function's argument as the meaning of the field remains throughout
the hole stack.
