Hi,
    How much kernel memory does a connected socket occupy? I know of
following :
For the fields which are declared pointer to some structure, i am taking
the size of that structure because eventually it will be kmalloced().
- the file table entry (struct file, struct file_operations, struct
dentry) = 260 bytes.
- the inode table (struct inode, struct inode_operations, struct 
super_block, struct file_lock) >= 716 bytes.
- struct socket + struct proto_ops = 104 bytes.
  Other structures in the network subsystem for a connected socket - How
much ?
Thanks,
Sushil.
