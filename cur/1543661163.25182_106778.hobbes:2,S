Since it's a system call I felt it was at least worth mentioning.

This is most odd, the system on which I discovered the problem most
definitely says in the man page that it's <unistd.h> Quite honestly it
didn't occur to me to check other systems... And sendfile is defined on
that system in unistd, and works.

See above, I just converted an app to use sendfile, that's how this
discussion came up.

The only sendfile I found was in libucb and is BSD compatible, there is no
man page. The two Solaris machines are less than a year old, so I'm not
sure what release you mean by "now" and can't check before Monday, as I
have no Solaris machines here.
