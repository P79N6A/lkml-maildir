An orderly shutdown will:
~    * claim locks and block as necessary
~    * free memory associated with the device
~    * flush device queues
~    * Fully shut down the device
An orderly shutdown should make sure the system remains sane after it
finishes and the data on the device is correct.
A panic shutdown should only disable DMA with as little code as possible
without locking, blocking, etc.  No effort should be taken to keep the
system sane (beyond clobbering memory), since it's not sane to begin 
with :-).
You may want to say that this shutdown will be the panic shutdown and not be
an orderly shutdown.  That's fine, although I would suggest a name change.
I couldn't find any documentation on what the shutdown call was supposed 
to do.

Are you sure this will be ok?  I'm not sure either way.  How much memory 
does
a kernel take to boot up and operate for this?  If it's a few meg, it's 
probably livable.
If it's a lot of memory, it's probably not going to be acceptable.
Plus, perhaps you would want to protect the output of the kernel dump 
somehow.
That's going to be a lot more memory than you can reserve.  And if you 
can shut
off DMA, none of this should matter anyway.
The rest of what you said, about the panic kernel only taking the core 
dump and
then rebooting, makes sense to me.
