Quite possible that it gets a double spindown with these laptop/drive 
combinations as well. I don't think it's particularly harmful as long as 
there's no emergency unload..

Don't think it would be very easy, it's presumably being done off some 
SMI code triggered from the ACPI power off register or something, so I'm 
assuming it's nothing the kernel sees in its ACPI tables..
