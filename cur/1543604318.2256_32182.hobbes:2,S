Looking at the vga screen without console-serial going on, I just saw an
endless stream of those errors.  With console getting logged over the
serial line though, I would see the same random garbage in the output I
sent you earlier, and not see the error message.
So, I tried inserting the die() like you said without console serial.  I
got pagefulls of dumps and pretty soon it rebooted itself.  So, I logged
to the serial console again on the next reboot to capture the output. 
Looks like we got the "APIC error" message in the log too.  It's a
really long log so I attached it rather than putting it inline.
Thanks,
Paul Larson
