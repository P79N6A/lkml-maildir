Yes. All the issues that I already brought up with Zach's patches are 
still there. This doesn't really change any of them. Any optimization that 
checks for "am I single-threaded" will need to be aware of pending and 
running async things.
With my patch, any _running_ async things will always be seen as normal 
clones, but the pending ones won't. So you'd need to effectively change 
anything that looks like
	if (atomic_read(&current->mm->count) == 1)
		.. do some simplified version ..
into
	if (!current->async_cookie && atomic_read(..) == 1)
		.. do the simplified thing ..
to make it safe.
I think we only do it for fget_light and some VM TLB simplification, so it 
shouldn't be a big burden to check.
Side note: the real issues still remain. The interfaces, and the 
performance testing.
