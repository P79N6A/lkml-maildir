Fine.  rm then.  perfectly useable.

I don't understand why you are saying that (in this context)

Sure.  But what is easier, to glance "something" about DMA errors among all
the other usual chatter, or just by itself?  That's something the different
KERN_ could do for us.

*laugh* true :)  Thats what il-user friendly tools are for.  I'm sure theres
some gtk/gnome/kde gui thing to select how to boot next time.  And if there
isn't I'm sure you realize its easy to do.

Soo.. bob goes to alice, and sees the usual messages.  Or, bob goes to alice:
"wow, how did you get all those mysterious messages from?"
Not only hiding would enhance this factor you are alluding(sp?), but it
would also help the people who are "impressed" by them.

Theres people who don't want to.  Mostly because for normal operation they
don't have to, and because they aren't willing to commit enough time/effort
to figure out what is going on.  If their car doesn't work, they take it to
a mechanic, they don't try to figure it out by themselves.  They know and
only want to drive it.
