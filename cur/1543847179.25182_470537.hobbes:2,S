You haven't demonstrated such a need either; so why doubt it?

If "close lid" means system suspend, then you _do_ want that
(by definition of system suspend).  If that doesn't trigger
system suspend, then it's up to you to decide whether or not
you "ifdown eth1" or not ... as with non-USB network adapters.
Likewise with autosuspending of network devices, which I'd
actually like to see happen.  Starting in 2.6.19-rc, the USB
drivers could be updated to do that, as I understand ... at
least for hardware that has sane remote wakeup capabilities.
No point in having host controllers doing nothing except
polling a USB network adapter, unless there's actually some
traffic directed to that host!

Lots of us would be even more unhappy to see USB network adapters
be made to follow different rules than non-USB ones.
