There is some code which might be useful in:
http://www.rpsys.net/openzaurus/patches/usb_add_epalloc-r3.patch
http://www.rpsys.net/openzaurus/patches/usb_pxa27x_udc-r3.patch
In the past I've tried to merge other peoples changes into these to make
one more useful driver but there are known issues with try to merge
either of these into mainline (particularly RNDIS support).
Cheers,
Richard
