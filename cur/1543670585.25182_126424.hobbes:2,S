The "good memory test suite" I have didn't catch it.  The copy method you 
suggest didn't catch it.  The BIOS memory check didn't catch it.  Only the 
linux compile method -- mentioned on this list -- did catch it.  And so did 
using md5sum on very long files.
(Maybe you missed reading the part that md5sum on small files never 
fails.  File copies on smaller files don't fail, either.  Otherwise, how 
did I get a Linux environment loaded and running with no problem?)
I'm pissed about this because, when I purchased the RAM a year and a half 
ago, I used the memory test suite to see if the stuff would work in these 
servers, AND THE TESTS PASSED.  So I accepted the RAM.  The money-back 
guarantee is long gone.  No, I didn't try a kernel compile.  My stupidity 
for believing in running only one diagnostic.
The server in question ran for a year as a moderate-use Web server, and 
would mystery only once in a great while.  It was taken out of service when 
a faster computer replaced it.  It's only now I find out the truth about 
the RAM incompatibility in it, when I tried to use the 40-GB hard drive in 
it as a staging vehicle.
