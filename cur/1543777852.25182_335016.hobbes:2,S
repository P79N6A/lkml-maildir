Have you checked how the statm shared is calculated? I guess it does
something like:
shared = mm->rss - mm->anon_rss
But in smaps output you can have anonymous area like:
b6e0e000-b6e13000 rw-p
Size:                20 KB
Rss:                  4 KB
Shared_Clean:         0 KB
Shared_Dirty:         4 KB
Private_Clean:        0 KB
Private_Dirty:        0 KB
Look that it presents 4 KB of shared value in area considered anonymous.
ANDREW: anon_rss is the rss for anonymous area, right?

How dou you know that 11MB is the correct shared value  and the 35MB
is the wrong value?
