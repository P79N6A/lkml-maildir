No, not like that at all. Structured storage adds an extra allocation
and namespace layer above the filesystem. This works in userspace,
but the performance is poor.
You can get the performance today by using directories, but that
destroys usability. Documents need to appear as files to the user,
so they must appear as files to traditional POSIX software.
It isn't enough to patch a file manager. You'd have to bloat
everything in the whole system, perhaps losing the performance!
The kernel can examine inodes and other structures directly,
so it can avoid much of the bloat.

Huh? This isn't about tagging files with creator, MIME type,
author, copyright, etc. No, the document itself is multi-part.

Well, we already have that in userspace. Performance is not great.

There is no real need to let dumb commands access document
internals. It might be useful, but also cause trouble.
