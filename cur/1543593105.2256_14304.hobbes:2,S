It clearly fills a need, though, and has the distinct side benefit of 
cutting down on the proliferation of ioctls. Sure, it's non-standard 
and a mess. But it's semi-documented, easy to use, and v. general. 
What's the preferred alternative, to state the first question another 
way? For any single small project/driver, creating a new fs simply 
isn't going to happen.
