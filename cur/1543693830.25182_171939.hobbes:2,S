How about The Vinum Volume Manager?
From Vinum homepage:
"The Vinum Volume Manager is a block device driver which implements
virtual disk drives. It isolates disk hardware from the block device
interface and maps data in ways which result in an increase in
flexibility, performance and reliability compared to the traditional
slice view of disk storage. Vinum implements the RAID-0, RAID-1 and
RAID-5 models, both individually and in combination.
Call for participation
Vinum is part of the base distribution of the FreeBSD operating system.
Versions exist for NetBSD and OpenBSD. I'm actively seeking people who
can help me port it to Linux."
