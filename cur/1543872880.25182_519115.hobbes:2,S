I consider that harder to read and uglier.  If anything maybe something
like:
#define __const_devinit
[...]
static __const_devinit struct snd_kcontrol_new snd_ice1712_delta1010lt_wordclock_status __devinitdata =
Worth it?  I doubt.

No, that results in warnings:
  CC      sound/pci/ice1712/ice1712.o
