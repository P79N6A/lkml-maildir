in 2.6.8 with all features and config options (at least those that will build) with 4GB memory option selected, kmem_cache_alloc crashes when called with requests for 64KB chunks of memory which exceed the kernel address space of 1GB in size rather than returning an out of memory error.  
It is crashing here:
     /* Get colour for the slab, and cal the next value. */
->>>>CRASH!!!        offset = cachep->colour_next;
        cachep->colour_next++;
        if (cachep->colour_next >= cachep->colour)
                cachep->colour_next = 0;
        offset *= cachep->colour_off;
                                                                                
        spin_unlock(&cachep->spinlock);
                                                                                
        if (local_flags & __GFP_WAIT)
                local_irq_enable();
