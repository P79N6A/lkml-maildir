latest checkpatch.pl works really well on sched.c.
there's only one problem left, this bogus false positive warning 
reappeared:
  WARNING: braces {} are not necessary for single statement blocks
  #5710: FILE: sched.c:5710:
  +       if (parent->groups == parent->groups->next) {
  +               pflags &= ~(SD_LOAD_BALANCE |
  +                               SD_BALANCE_NEWIDLE |
  +                               SD_BALANCE_FORK |
  +                               SD_BALANCE_EXEC |
  +                               SD_SHARE_CPUPOWER |
  +                               SD_SHARE_PKG_RESOURCES);
  +       }
(there's another place in sched.c that trips this up too.)
i think it has been pointed out numerous times that it is perfectly fine 
to use curly braces for multi-line single-statement blocks. That 
includes simple cases like this too:
	if (x) {
		/* do y() */
		y();
	}
it's perfectly legitimate, in fact more robust. So if checkpatch.pl 
wants to make any noise about such constructs it should warn about the 
_lack_ of curly braces in every multi-line condition block _except_ the 
only safe single-line statement:
	if (x)
		y();
thanks,
	Ingo
