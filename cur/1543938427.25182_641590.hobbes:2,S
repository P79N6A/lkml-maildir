SIGOPS Operating Systems Review Special Issue on
  Research and Developments in the Linux Kernel
The Linux kernel, since its inception in 1991, has captured the
interest of many thousands of developers and millions of users. It
recently celebrated its 16th anniversary, includes many millions of
lines of code, and is used in production systems around the world. It
is also advancing at an increasingly rapid pace, undergoing many
changes every single day.
For this OSR special issue, we welcome technical papers covering the
latest advances that have been or will soon be merged into the Linux
kernel, as well as wild idea papers discussing promising experimental
work. In recognition of the current chasm that we wish to bridge, we
encourage papers from both the Linux kernel community and the research
community. The OSR issue aims to:
a) expose members of the Linux kernel community to exploratory
   research work that is going on which might influence Linux's
   evolution, and
b) expose members of the systems research community to the latest
   happenings in a mature, production kernel that is widely used and
   advancing rapidly.
Please submit papers related to all aspects of the Linux kernel. In
particular, papers are solicited for the the following areas:
* Virtualization
* I/O, networking and interconnects
* Support for multi-core and heterogeneous CPUs
* Co-existence with other operating systems
* filesystems, clustering, SSI
* Profiling, performance tuning, debugging
* Scaling up (e.g., supercomputers) and down (e.g., embedded devices)
* Experience reports
* Research directions
Submissions should be between 5 and 10 pages (in a font no smaller
than 10 pt). Standard SIGOPS formatting rules apply (see
http://www.sigops.org/osr.html
). Papers should report on significant
new results or directions and include at least some material that has
not been published before. Papers will be reviewed by the guest
editors and the review committee. Accepted papers will be published in
the July 2008 issue of Operating Systems Review.
Please upload your submissions (in PDF format only) to the conference
website, at 
http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=osrlk2008.
 If
you have any questions or comments, please do not hesitate to contact
the guest editors.
