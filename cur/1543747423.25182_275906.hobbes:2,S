reported resource usage is an estimate based on sampling. With HZ=1000 you do get a more accurate
sampling of reality.....
In addition, do check if your code (or X) doesn't do timeouts of < 10 msec; in HZ=100 kernels those always 
delay 10 or 20 msec, while with HZ=1000 kernels the delay becomes far more accurate.
