You can at least get a backtrace, which is useful enough.

Ah this was a misunderstanding. I was just talking about plain recovery
from stack faults; not from hardware stack overflow detection. Even without
wather tight overflow detection they happen often enough and usually not
too long after a stack page overflow.
