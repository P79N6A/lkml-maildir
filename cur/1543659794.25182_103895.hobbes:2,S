kmem is in `/dev`. It's a device you would use if you wanted to read
all of kernel memory without locking problems.
If you really want to get a snapshot of kernel memory, then do
cat /proc/kcore >/tmp/foo.  /tmp/foo can then be manipulated.
The problem is that /proc/kcore is dynamic, the mere act of
'inspecting' it modifies is. 'tar' ends up doing 'morecore',
extending the break address when it encounters this large "file".
This attempts to modify the kernel which has a lock because of
the read. The result is a deadlock. Since `cat` or `cp` use
small blocks and never have to call the kernel for additional
resources, you can use them to get a snapshot.
