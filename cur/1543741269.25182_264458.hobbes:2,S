That's strange, I wonder why you think BK doesn't help.  The prevailing
wisdom is that it has helped.  It's well documented by third parties
who have nothing to do with you or me.
Is it possible that you have an axe to grind about BK and that any
positive statement about BK will be challenged by you no matter how
silly that makes you appear?
Maybe you know about some different system that would have worked better.
Perhaps you could share with the rest of us what that system is and how
it works better.

The implication that Andrew doesn't use BK is incorrect, we see him in
the logs all the time.  You're right that he uses other tools to manage
his collection of patches and we agree with his reasons for doing so.
But he also uses BK and has pointed out himself the fact that BK has
helped the kernel development effort.
