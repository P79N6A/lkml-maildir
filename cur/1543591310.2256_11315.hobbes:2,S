Hmm.  It's interesting to me that there have been no replies discussing
Tim's code.  Are any of you looking at it or do you simply think it is
inconsequential and deserves to be ignored?
Or, perhaps folks feel that it is off-topic?
Since, as Alan mentioned, the lack of device serial numbers for USB mice
and keyboards means that the only way to implement a relatively stable
assignment of USB input devices to a quasi-multiuser system with 
multi-headed displays is by paying attention to USB topology, I would
like us to explore any implementation that includes this support.  As
Linus mentioned, this approach is unreliable, but it's all we have for
these devices -- Topology can be disturbed by a variety of events
(plugging a hub into a different host-controller port, etc).
