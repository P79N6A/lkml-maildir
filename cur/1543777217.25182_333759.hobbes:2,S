OK, I do indeed have critical sections spanning rcu_check_callbacks()
and process-level code.  Since rcu_check_callbacks() is called from
account_user_vtime() and update_process_times(), both of which call
scheduler_tick(), looks like I need to disable hardware interrupts.
Looks to me like I need to use _raw_spin_lock() and
_raw_spin_unlock() from within rcu_check_callbacks(), but to instead
use _raw_spin_lock_irqsave() and _raw_spin_lock_irqrestore() outside of
rcu_check_callbacks() for locks acquired within rcu_check_callbacks().
Of course, for fliplock, which is only acquired conditionally from
a rcu_check_callbacks() callee, I can just use spin_trylock() and
spin_unlock().  Though _raw_spin_lock()/_raw_spin_unlock() might be
faster?
No -wonder- I have been seeing hangs in CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT!!!  ;-)
						Thanx, Paul
