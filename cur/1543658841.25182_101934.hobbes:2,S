1. All recent 2.5/2.4 kernels have a blacklist rule that is supposed
   to prevent the kernel from enabling the local APIC.
   That kernel version are you using? What .config?
   Doesn't the kernel boot log contain something like "Dell Inspiron
   with broken BIOS detected. Refusing to enable the local APIC"?
2. There is no "APIC support help page" that I know of.
Are you sure you didn't mean ACPI instead? APIC != ACPI but
people keep confusing the two.
