The ABI is actually a very small part of the asm/ files [1] and typically
one that does not see many changes. I found 5 files (fcntl.h ioctl.h
siginfo.h statfs.h types.h) that have trivial differences between i386
and x86_64 and can be merged, as well as 6 files (posix_types.h ptrace.h
sigcontext.h signal.h stat.h unistd.h) that are so different that it
makes sense to keep them completely separate files with an extra file
to choose between them.
The rest is either not part of the ABI or already identical.

[1] A quick browse over the files suggests we need only:
  errno.h fcntl.h ioctl.h ioctls.h ipc.h ipcbuf.h msgbuf.h
  param.h poll.h posix_types.h ptrace.h resource.h sembuf.h
  shmbuf.h shmparam.h sigcontext.h siginfo.h signal.h
  socket.h sockios.h stat.h statfs.h termbits.h termios.h
  types.h unistd.h
  If anyone has a better list, please post it.
