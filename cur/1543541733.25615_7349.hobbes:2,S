CONFIG_VISWS
  The SGI Visual Workstation series is an IA32-based workstation
  based on SGI systems chips with some legacy PC hardware attached.
  Say Y here to create a kernel to run on the SGI 320 or 540.
  A kernel compiled for the Visual Workstation will not run on other
  PC boards and vice versa.
