This reminds me - the current logic is currently a bit suboptimal on
many NUMA systems. Often it would be better to be a bit more
aggressive at freeing memory (maybe do a very low overhead light try to
free pages) in the first node before falling back to other nodes. What
right now happens is that when you have even minor memory pressure
because e.g. you node is filled up with disk cache the local memory
affinity doesn't work too well anymore.
