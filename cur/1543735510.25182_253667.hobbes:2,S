There is a recent post with details of what's needed for the nvidia 
driver to compile and work. Links to patched are included. For that one, 
put as the first line in nv.c
unsigned int __VMALLOC_RESERVE;
There is also the need to add "PM_SAVE_STATE, /* save device's state */" 
to included/linux/pm.h after PM_RESUME line and a previous patch to nv.c 
that's been around a few weeks now.
Regards
Sid.
