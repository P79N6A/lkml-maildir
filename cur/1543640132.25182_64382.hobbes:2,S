Hm, I think you're missing the whole point about classes.  You are
trying to do to the driver code, what will be done with the class
code.
Here's the interaction:
	- devices have a driver bound to them
	- devices live in the /root tree, showing how they are
	  interconnected.
	- drivers register with a bus (possibly more than one.)
	- drivers bind to a device present on a bus, and a class (some
	  drivers bind to many classes)
	- classes interact with userspace somehow, providing the
	  interface between the device and the user.
As an example:
	- A USB keyboard lives in the device tree.
	- The USB HID driver binds to the device, and the input class
	  (both the keyboard and generic subclasses of the input code.)
	- the user types keys, and that data gets sent from the USB
	  code, to the HID driver, to the input core, which then
	  translates them and sends the info out the /dev node.
Within your model, you are not accounting for the different classes
(input, serial, usb-serial, tty, disk, video, etc.).  Take a look at the
documentation for all of this for more information.

No.

No.  Let's leave that the way things are today in this regards.
