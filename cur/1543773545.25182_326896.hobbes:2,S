Subject: [PATCH] I2C: add i2c sensor_device_attribute and macros
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

[PATCH] I2C: add i2c sensor_device_attribute and macros
This patch creates a new header with a potential standard i2c sensor
attribute type (which simply includes an int representing the sensor
number/index) and the associated macros, SENSOR_DEVICE_ATTR to define
a static attribute and to_sensor_dev_attr to get a
sensor_device_attribute reference from an embedded device_attribute
reference.
