Subject: [PATCH] 2.6.14 include/asm-arm/arch-ixp4xx/timex.h: fix clock frequency on NSLU2
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/10/28/67

The basis for this patch has been discussed on l-a-k on a thread
with subject line "IXP4xx timer interupt bug" then later on 
nslu2-developers@nslu2-linux.org on a thread "ixp4xx variable
timer base issue".
The problem is that the NSLU2 deviates from the Intel IXDP425
system by using a cystal with frequency 66MHz as opposed to the
Intel stated (not quite mandated) value of 66.666666MHz.  This
results in serious errors in the RTC (1%).
The patch configs in the correct value for the NSLU2.  The problem
with the patch is that a multi-config kernel which includes NSLU2
support will use the NSLU2 frequency.  However such kernels are
not a requirement as generic kernels are never flashed into NSLU2
systems (so there is no need to build NSLU2 support into a generic
kernel).
