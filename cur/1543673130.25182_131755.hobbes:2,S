Larry,
I was wondering if you would considier putting a bkbits web frontend on 
kernel.bkbits.net.  I can think of a few cases where it might come in 
handy.  For example, one of the devs is too busy (understandably) to 
roll a patch at a given point in time and states in response to a bug 
report that (s)he'll get linus to pull the fixes later on.  In this 
case, people who like to live dangerously and don't want to wait might 
take it upon themselves to surf over to kernel.bkbits.net and download 
the ChangeSet rather than cloning an *entire* tree just to get it.  I 
suppose this would also serve as a means for people who do not (or 
cannot) use bitkeeper to get said ChangeSet.
Cheers,
Nicholas
