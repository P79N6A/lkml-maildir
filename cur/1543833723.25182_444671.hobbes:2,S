before this got spread around wrong. What I saw was an error window when
logging into Gnome. It said "failed to initialize HAL!". In fact it
seems that this is not a HAL error, it is an error of an application
using HAL and I suspect it was NetworkManager. However with 2.6.17.6 or
2.6.18-rc2 this is no problem anymore.
