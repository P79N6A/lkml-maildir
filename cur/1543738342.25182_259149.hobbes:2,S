I think your missing something here.  CKRM, as I understand it, aspires
to be a general purpose resource management framework.  To that point I
will accede.  But the second part, about CKRM being the embodiment of
fair share scheduling, is secondary.  That is simply one of it's
potential functions as a general purpose resource management framework. 
It could also be the embodiment of unfair scheduling, if you choose to
implement such a resource controller.  It wouldn't be very useful, but
it could be a fun exercise! ;)

I don't think that is terribly fair.  I can honestly say that I'm not
opposing your implementation because of who you work for.  I could care
less.  I'm opposing it because I think I've got an alternative that can
offer the same functionality with less impact.  I don't work on CKRM,
and when I wrote my code CKRM was not even on my radar.  If
sched_domains will play nicer with CKRM than cpusets, thats just a
bonus.  I certainly didn't design it that way!

*More* analogies!?! ;)
