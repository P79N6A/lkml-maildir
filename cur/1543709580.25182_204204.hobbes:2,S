Start out by forcing it to a lower link speed, at that signal quality
you really don't want to try and go above 2MBit/sec. If you keep
trying to do 11MBit/sec the card will constantly try the higher rate
and then lose signal, drop down and try again. Fixing the rate should
improve the situation - at least it has always done so for me ;-)
Cheers,
Jes
