eth0: Transmit error, Tx status register 82.
This is an "out of window collision", otherwise known
as a "Transmit reclaim error".
It is almost certainly caused by another machine on
your network entering full-duplex mode.  It stomps 
on the 3c905's Tx packets and the collision is
detected too late for the 905 to be able to
retransmit - some of the packet contents have
been discarded from the on-chip FIFO.
Next time it happens, you need to run around the
building and find out who just did something such
as turning their computer on, or mucking around
with dangerous Linux netdriver module parameters.
If this description doesn't match your situation
please let me know and we'll work on it.
