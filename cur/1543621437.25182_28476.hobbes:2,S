Subject: ALSA fails to build sequencers?

This has been an issue for a long while in the alsa-driver CVS tree and 
now is an issue in 2.5.4-dj2: the only snd-seq-* module to be built is 
snd-seq-oss.o, the rest of them are not built at all.  Under the ALSA 
CVS tree I could build them manually, correctly - they were just skipped 
over in "make all."  I suspect this is  a trivial Makefile issue, but I 
have not found it in what time I have spent on it.
