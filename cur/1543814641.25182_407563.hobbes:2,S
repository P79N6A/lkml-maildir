Only x86 has this bug, so only x86 needs to be fixed. Neverthless
Ashok's patch [1] should address all architectures that may implement
smp_prepare_cpu() in future as well.

I have done some basic test of the patch using Bryce's scripts.
Regarding enable_nonboot_cpus(), from my reading of it, it should not
call smp_prepare_cpu on online cpus, so the check added should not cause
it to panic. Am I missing something?
Finally, I think the patch Ashok posted sometime back [1] is probably a more
neater solution to this bug (he probably needs to modify it slightly to 
remove smp_prepare_cpu from enable_nonboot_cpus as well).
