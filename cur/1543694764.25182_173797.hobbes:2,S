Subject: Module problems with NVIDIA and 2.6.0-test8?

I recently built test8 and also the NVIDIA driver using the patches from
minion.de. The compile had no errors and I can load the module without
errors as well (aside from the "NVIDIA taints the kernel" message).
However, even with the module loaded, X says it cannot initialize it and
acts exactly as if the module was never there. Not much is left to work
with in the logs so frankly I'm stumped. The system works fine with the
"nv" driver and I had the driver working in test1. Has anyone else
experienced a problem like this?
