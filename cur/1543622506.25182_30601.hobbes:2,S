Perhaps you three remember my reports about crashes in the scheduler.
After I was able to fetch an Oops on 2.4.17 (without kdb) I noticed
this:
my bt848 didn't generate any interrupts (so videotext and epg didn't work
but TV worked)
In a last temptation I checked the BIOS and switched from MPP 1.4 to 1.1
And guess what? The box is running fine again for several weeks.
The BIOS was buggy before(different MTRR on CPUs) , I upgraded "years" ago.
I can't remember when I switched this entry in the BIOS.
Possibly there is a bug in the MPP tables (setup through BIOS) when set to 1.4?
Damn, never play with your BIOS settings if the box runs fine ... especially
if you forget that fact ;-)
