I stand corrected. after looking a little bit deeper, the sun partition
has been corrected, the other are not touched.
However, I found out that sgi partitionning had this "renumbering"
issue even before viro's patch.
I don't know if this is correct, in any case this is an untested patch
that changes this behaviour for sgi partitions.
patch is attached because of dumb mailer.
thanks,
