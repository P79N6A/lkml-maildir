While the above is true, maintaining sane device request queues is
not the only purpose the io_request_lock serves (unfortunately). Many
low level drives (SCSI was particularly bad) uses it as well, so
just replacing it with per request queue spin locks is not as
straight forward as it may seem.
It is a future plan, though.
