It's not only that Dell that has trouble with broadcasts. On newer platforms
which support CPU hotplug there are races at the hardware level with
broadcasting. That is why we're moving away from it.
Not sure why this particular case got missed. Ashok might want to comment -
he did the hotplug work.
