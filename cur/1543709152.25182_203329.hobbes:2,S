02 is "receive checksum error". Your mainboard is
corrupting messages on the APIC bus. That's extremely bad.
Many people have had problems with older dual-Athlon boards.
Ensure that the power supply and cooling solution are adequate,
and that the memory modules are certified.
Failing that, try the "noapic" kernel parameter.
