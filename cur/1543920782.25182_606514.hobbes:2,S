I don't have any particularly strong opinions on which would be the best
way to clean this up.  Hopefully someone who is more involved with the DMA
mapping interfaces can help out.
It wouldn't be efficient for you to implement something new, only to have
it criticized again.  I'd suggest that you come up with a concrete
design, describe to us what you propose to do and let's take it from there.
