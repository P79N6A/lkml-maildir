Bart, I'm really not interested in a 500 email rehash of the fact you
chose to refuse the hotplug support (that was working) for 2.6.x. You
did, the world has moved on, and there is no point putting a busproc
function in that driver.
Do something useful. Send a patch to make Sergei the IDE maintainer as
he's doing all the IDE stuff these days.
