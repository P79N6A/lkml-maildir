  /******* Eid Mubarok and greetings to all of this kernel mailing list
                        on the occasion of the Holy Eid

hi,
        thanx for ur quick response. Actually what i need (a part of my
academic project), is just to comile ur code and load it as a module and
then to see whether the bare mouse specific events occur. but the painful
reality is, i failed to do so. FYI,  i just a sophomore undergraduate
student, and i don't find any resourse inside or outside my faculty to help
me to do this. So i had to come in the kernel mailing list, though i am
almost a newbie.
        i tried with minor numbers other than 0. first i tried with ,inor
number 1, cauze this is the number i got in /proc/misc allocated for psaux,
in that file. but the result is same. now while i try to load the module,
the error message is:
        init_module: no such device, invalid parameters
        hint: invalid IO or irq number
        then i arbitary tried with some other minor numbers, but the result
is same.
So plz help me to just load the module. as u r the author, certainly u
compiled that code and load the module. so plz tell me ur parameters, i.e.
the port address and major-minor number and irq number, or other hints so
that i load that module.
TIK

Shahid
