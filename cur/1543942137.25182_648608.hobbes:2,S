I'm in same position as you here. I only have few old binaries :-(.

SuS:
# The brk() and sbrk() functions are used to change the amount of space
# allocated for the calling process.
It talks about "space for calling process". It does not talk about
heap, and I think it implicitely assumes "bss and heap" are
continuous... 
(It also says return 0 or success, and we return address).

I believe it implicitely assumes start_brk is well known,
actually. Otherwise it should have told us how to get start_brk.
