Oooh. Cool. (-:
Talking about performance. When streaming I noticed that the request size
increases until it reaches 128kiB. 
This would be all fine except that nbd (or other part of the kernel?)
splits those up into two requests, one 130048 bytes and one 1024 bytes
which is not the best for performance. Note I am running a kernel with
memmory debugging (and everything else debugging) enabled so that might be
interfering here, haven't tried without debugging support in the kernel
yet... Just thought you might want to know... (The client here is 2.5.7 +
latest nbd-client from nbd CVS on SF.net.)
Best regards,
	Anton
