I see a contradiction in your sentence.  "a new ip_tables is loaded"
every time a user changes a single rule.  There are numerous setups that
dynamically change the ruleset (e.g. at interface up/down point, or even
think of your typical wlan hotspot, where once a user is authorized,
he'll get different rules.
