On Linux we run through all handlers for shared interrupts, it is up to 
the handler to figure out wether it really was supposed to receive that 
interrupt (normally quick status checks for hardware).

For sanity's sake stick to running through all of them, there should be no 
partial handling, every registered handler should get serviced once per 
NMI interrupt.
