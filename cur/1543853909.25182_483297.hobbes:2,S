Can you try this updated patch?

Changes from v6b (which you were using)
  * A few PPC-related fixes and other cleanups from BenH
  * Rewrote the suspend/resume code to use standard 
    pci_save_state/pci_restore_state/pci_set_power_state calls instead 
    of the manual saving and twiddling of PCI registers.
This power management code change is very much of an experiment -- it's 
certianly possible there's a good reason to do it manually, but I 
suspect it's just because that code is old.
Let me know if this is an improvement.
