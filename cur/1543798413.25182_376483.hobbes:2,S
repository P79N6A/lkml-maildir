You are using the wrong hammer to crack your nut.
You should instead approach your problem of why the ARP entry gets lost.
For example, you could give as critical priority to your TCP session, 
but that still won't cure your ARP problem.
I would suggest that the best way to cure your arp problem, is to 
increase the time between arp cache refreshes.
