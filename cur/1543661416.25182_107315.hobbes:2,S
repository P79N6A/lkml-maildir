What kernel was kernbench compiling ? The reason I'm asking is that
2.5s (and more recent 2.4.21pre's) will use -march flags for more
aggressive optimisation on newer gcc's.
If you want to compare apples to apples, make sure you choose
something like i386 in the processor menu, and then it'll always
use -march=i386 instead of getting fancy with things like -march=pentium4
