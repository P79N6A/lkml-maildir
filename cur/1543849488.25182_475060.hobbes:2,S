Why not do the cache flush _after_ the TLB flush? There's still a mapping, 
and never mind that it's read-only: the _mapping_ still exists, and I 
doubt any CPU will not do the writeback (the readonly bit had better 
affect the _frontend_ of the memory pipeline, but affectign the back end 
would be insane and very hard, since you can't raise a fault any more).
Hmm?
