Thats a fairly large 'mandatory' requirement for existing users
of hptraid and friends.

I held off on this to see if Kai would get things in order in time.
Looking at current BK, it looks like he's done quite a bit.
Kai, any changes from a user point of view wrt tools ?

Hadn't realised they were still broken. Added to the list.

Added. Was covered by the 'most drivers wont compile' though now that
current BK has nuked the abort: and reset: members.

Was covered in the devicemapper section.
Reworded to make the 'backwards compatability' thing a bit more obvious.

I'd agree that it would make sense to at least remove some of the
lesser maintained drivers. Linus didnt seem to keen on the idea
last time I proposed it.

Oops, my bad. Hard to keep up with the crazy world of IDE these days..

Ok, I'll make that a little bolder. (In fact, I'll just
cut-n-paste your text 8-)
Thanks for the feedback. I've merged the rest of your
comments, and will put an updated version up after
merging everyone elses feedback too 8-)
BTW: How's i2o shaping up in 2.5 ?
