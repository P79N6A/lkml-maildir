Yes, absolutely.  And I don't think we need to confine our audience to the
novice user, even the most seasoned users will benefit from a central
repository of performance tips.

Funny, at my company, we were just discussing making a similar offer to the
Linux community.  I guess you've beaten us to the punch!  That's probably
a good thing because our web server is currently behind a busy ISDN
connection. :-(
Is anyone on this list a member of the linux-perf list?  I just joined it
recently but there's not much traffic.  Perhaps we should take this
discussion there.

We're also very interested in sar and other performance monitoring tools.

Have you considered contacting the LDP?  The contact for HOWTOs is
linux-howto@metalab.unc.edu but I think a Performance-HOWTO is a little
limited, at least for what I have in mind.  I'm not sure who to contact for
larger projects, anyone know?

Same here.
