Andrew/Tony/Russell/Dmitry,
This is a revised patch as per the review comments from the RMK
on thread:

Please review it and give me the Ack if looks ok.
This patch adds keymapsize, delay and debounce flag in the
keypad platform data for various TI OMAP1/2 based boards like F-sample,
H2, H3, Innovator, Nokia770, OSK, Perseus and H4.
