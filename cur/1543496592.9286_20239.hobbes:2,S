What I found is useful is to create a dummy function at
the top of the c source file (so it is 1st in text section).
Then in init_module(), call the dummy function which
returns the address of the dummy function in eax. Follow this
with a hardcoded breakpoint. When the module is loaded
gdb will hit the breakpoint and you can use the add-symbol-file
command with the value in eax.
#define BREAKPOINT() asm("   int $3");
/* add as 1st function in module */
void* get_text_ptr(void);
void* get_text_ptr() {return mgsl_get_text_ptr;}
int init_module(void)
{
/*
 * mgsl_get_text_ptr() leaves the .text address in eax
 * which can be used with add-symbol-file with gdb.
 */
    get_text_ptr();
    BREAKPOINT();
    /* other init code */
}
