Ok, if there are other high precision timers we can use, I guess it may
be better to fall back on them.

Hrm, I see. I though those freq change without notification would happen
rarely and could be dealt by resynchronizing the CPUs. I guess I was
wrong.

So we can get a monotonic, non NTP corrected timestamp quickly from user
space without going through a system call. Are there other alternatives ?
Thanks,
