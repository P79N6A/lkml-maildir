Hi,
I can't get locking to work with nfs with server/clients
2.2.{3-6}-ac{various}
I saw that there's a nolock option to mount, so i tried passing a
"lock" option. no change.
rpcinfo -p on the server:
    100005    1   udp    926  mountd
    100005    1   tcp    928  mountd
    100005    2   udp    931  mountd
    100005    2   tcp    933  mountd
    100003    2   udp   2049  nfs
    100021    1   udp   1024  nlockmgr
    100021    3   udp   1024  nlockmgr
    100021    1   tcp   1024  nlockmgr
    100021    3   tcp   1024  nlockmgr
but no matter what i try the testlk programme included with
knfs-1.2 fails, with:
fcntl(3, F_SETLK, {type=F_RDLCK, whence=SEEK_SET, start=0, len=0}) =
-1 ENOLCK (No locks available) 
am i missing something obvious? I need locking to work.
