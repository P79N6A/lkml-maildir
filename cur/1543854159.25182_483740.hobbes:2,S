I am sorry but I am completely unaware of the details of Copyright
information. Somebody please tell me what should be the right info
here given that basically I have taken the code from
arch/x86_64/boot/head.S, picked modifications done by Eric and minor
changes of my own.
Do I copy here all the copyright info of head.S and then add Eric's
name and mine too?
Thanks
Vivek
