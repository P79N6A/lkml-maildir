Serial drivers should then at least (when seeing ldisc->modem_change
!= NULL) do no RTS/CTS/DTR/etc handling at all (to avoid interfering),
and activate "MSI" for calling modem_change in the interrupt handler.
Being able to call port->ops->start/stop_tx by some way will also be
necessary, by grouping 
{
  struct uart_state *state = tty->driver_data;
  struct uart_port *port = state->port;
  tty->hw_stopped = 0;
  port->ops->start_tx(port, 0);
  uart_write_wakeup(port);
}
and its dual in some function for instance.
