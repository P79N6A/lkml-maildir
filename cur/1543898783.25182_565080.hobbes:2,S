Actually it isn't necessary to have a test to check if the device is 
suspended.  We simply call the autoresume routine; if the device isn't 
suspended that routine doesn't have to do anything.
I agree that that the extra test (for system-wide suspend underway) is
needed only if the autoresume fails, which isn't part of the main
pathway.  So it doesn't add runtime overhead -- but handling it does
add code overhead.
