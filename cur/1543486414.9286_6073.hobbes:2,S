Bring at least one instance of each parent into dcache.  I don't think
this should be significantly worse than having a long path for the first
reference to a directory.
I haven't thought a lot about tricks with mount (union filesystems, etc.)
but I'm assuming that we're not going to allow stunts like mounting a
file system in a subdirectory contained inside itself.  So, you don't
have to worry once you cross the mount point, even if the mount point
has multiple identities -- hard links can't span filesystems.
Note that I'm presuming that, within the filesystem, each directory must
have an internal unique id (perhaps block # -- if the file system doesn't
have inodes), and that the test you want to perform is: directory being
renamed is not in the set of {target directory, ancestors of target
directory in this same filesystem}.

Use a per-filesystem directory rename lock when renaming a directory
and parallel parents are an issue.  [I guess, to be safe, we'd have to
use the lock to determine if parallel parents are an issue.]
