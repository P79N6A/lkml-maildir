What does this mean, "image is sent"? Can you be more specific, like
"I do this: 'cp my_file /dev/sdb1'"
Also, watch logs closely, both syslog (where hotplug and udev are sending
their messages (btw hotplug is shell scripts, you may add debug messages
into them if you need to)), and kernel log.
You can also 'strace -p <pid of udevd>' and strace your cp or whatever
you use to copy image to device.
