As I was digging through the functions there was one thing that struck 
me. The parameter for the tasklet is of type unsigned long, not void*. 
Since the parameter in most cases is a pointer this might cause problems 
on 64-bit systems. Or does the kernel do some magic to map kernel memory 
in the first 4 GB?
