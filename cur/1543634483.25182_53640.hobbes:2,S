No.  The platform group is set on a journaling file system. They had already
run a comparison of the ones available and based on their criteria, ext3 was
the best choice.  Based on the lockmeter data, it does look as though the
scaling is trapped behind the BKL.

Yup.  I take it back - high ext3 lock contention happens on 2.5
as well, which has block-highmem.  With heavy write traffic onto
six disks, two controllers, six filesystems, four CPUs the machine
spends about 40% of the time spinning on locks in fs/ext3/inode.c
You're un dual CPU, so the contention is less.
Not very nice.  But given that the longest spin time was some
tens of milliseconds, with the average much lower, it shouldn't
affect overall I/O throughput.
Possibly something else is happening.  Have you tested ext2?
