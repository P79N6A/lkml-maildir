99.9% of people run the DRM code in the kernel tree, so definitions of 
canonical might vary. I don't personally see a problem with the ifdefs.
The DRI devel tree has to work with anything, the kernel gets the luxury
of being able to strip out the defines that aren't needed for that
specific release.
