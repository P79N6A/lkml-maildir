A software modem DSP is bad because it is very timing-sensitive,
no matter how powerful the cpu is.  The very sensitive stuff is
better left to dedicated hardware.  Use the cpu for less critical stuff,
such as running generic programs and tossing bytes/pages to the
dedicated hardware.  
IDE used to be a cpu-intensive cheap disk interface.  They have
implemented DMA now in order to offload the cpu - guess why?
The same applies to winmodems.  (Can you even run several winmodems
in one machine?)
A cheaper modem with compression & the hayes command interface in 
software might make sense.  Putting DSP jobs like echo cancelling and such in
software is just broken.
