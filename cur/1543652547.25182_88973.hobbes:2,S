When register_kprobe() is called with a bad addr, we crash the kernel.
Should it be the reponsibility of the caller, or the kernel to make sure the
addr is ok?
The kernel could check by adding a
+unsigned short tmp;
....
+if(__get_user(tmp, (unsigned short *)p->addr)) {
+        ret = -EINVAL;
+        goto out;
+}
to register_kprobe()

BTW, I have a stupid little sample char driver that reads in address/message
pairs and then adds a probe that printk's the message at the address.  This
was just my way of learning how to use kprobes.  Should I post it?  I would
love to get feedback on what I did wrong, but I hate to spam the list.
