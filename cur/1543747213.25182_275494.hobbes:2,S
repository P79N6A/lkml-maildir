Ok, I finally got -13 to run (typo in grub), and you are now correct 
in that the final entry in the log after I shut tvtime down is like 
this:
Nov 29 23:43:40 coyote kernel: rtc latency histogram of {tvtime/3911, 
10430 samples}:

What does this tell you now?  The last 2 lines look a bit strange to
me.  Particularly since the runtime was random enough that your 
previous comment about the number 820 was a mssing count, and what 
came out of a seperate run IS an 820.
I find that a bit hard to believe that I timed those two runs 
identically.
