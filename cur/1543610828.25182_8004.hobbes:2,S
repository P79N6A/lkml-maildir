   umm..  I've never seen any numbers from you, David.
   
I'll work on something for you this week then :-)
Not a problem.
   ergo, there is no point in futzing with the pagecache_lock *at all*
   until either TUX is merged, or we decide to support large-scale
   NUMA hardware well
   
Or your "1a", "other sendfile applications", right?
I really still feel (and will try to show with numbers) that the copy
being present is not so important.  Like I have stated on other
occaisions, several platforms do not harm L2 cache state during
copies, new lines are never brought in.
I expect x86 systems to move more in this direction if they aren't
somewhat there already.
