We're still getting our act together since Nathan is no longer here.
Going forward the new git tree is at:
     git://oss.sgi.com:8090/xfs/xfs-2.6
This has some more recent changes than the "nathans" one but
is far from up to date with the internal sgi tree and the external
cvs tree (as you noticed with the nathans one:).
I will get the "xfs" one updated in the next day or so.
(Aside: for some strange reason, the "nathans" one has 3 extra
  mods (commits) and as expected (to me:) the "xfs" one has 10 extra
  mods (commits) and there is about 46 mods (including missing 3)
  pending for the "xfs" tree.
  If we end up moving from our internal SCM to git at some point,
  this could make the updates less of a hassle:).
