The LSM patch's goal is to only _allow_ you do add access control
mechanisms to the kernel easily.
This accessfs patch doesn't collide with that goal at all.  If it gets
accepted into the kernel, people who write LSM based access control
modules need to remember to medaite access to the accessfs if they want
to.  Since the LSM hooks are much lower in the vfs than accessfs, it is
a simple thing to add this kind of access mediation.
Hope this helps clear it up a bit.
