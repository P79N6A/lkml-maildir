In the user-mode kernel, I need to be able to have a process fork and have the 
child stopped.  I do get to rewrite the system call, but I don't get to chose 
the code that gets cloned to.
Right now, I write a halt instruction right after the system call, and use the 
resulting seg fault to stop the child.  A CLONED_STOPPED flag would be far 
more pleasant.
