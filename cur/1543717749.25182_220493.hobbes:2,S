You are correct; defaults are indeed needed. The current default value
for mq_msgsize seems rather large considering that mq_msgsize*mq_maxmsg
bytes will have to be allocated on queue creation. If variable sized large
payload messages are needed one might consider using shared memory in
combination with a message queue.
My main point was that mq_send()/mq_timedsend() may not return ENOMEM
and I am positive I did not misread the standard on that.
