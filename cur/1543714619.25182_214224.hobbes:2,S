This is pretty much covered in the NFS FAQ entry B10.
You are experiencing the classical effects of using unreliable transport
(i.e. UDP) on a mixed speed network. Writes to the server are getting
lost, because it is on a slow segment that cannot keep up with the
faster 100Mbit clients.
Use the 'proto=tcp' mount option, and all will be well again.
Cheers,
