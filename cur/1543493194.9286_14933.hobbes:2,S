uid 'named' has write rights to /var/named/(secondaries); the admin user
in a capabilities-based system design should probably not own any files.

In case admin fires it up by hand, so it can still write to it's
secondaries files.

So anybody who breaks uid=0 can modify the file's inheritable set to
inherit everything, and no CAP_SETFCAP is required.  That's wrong.

Yes, I do need to mark it as capability enabled, because setting caps in
the fs (permitted -or- inheritable) is a priviledged op.

What's worse here is the inheritable set; if admin exec's named by hand,
it gets a full inheritable set!  That could be bad, which is why I'm also
suggesting addition of an fM, inheritable Mask.  This would apply
inheritable for pP purposes, but also then drop most of pI.  So the new
formula for pI would be pI' = pI && fM.  With this, it would be safe for
an admin bash shell with a full inheritable set to exec named, and not
worry that named could then run a bash shell which inherits all.
cheers,
