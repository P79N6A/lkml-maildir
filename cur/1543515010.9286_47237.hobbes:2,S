  There's a VGA palette manipulator in ../contrib in the SVGATextMode
  package, if I recall where I got it, and you can bang on this stuff
  from userland via something that can lseek /dev/port.

  The kernel (at least 2.0.x) recognizes also magic escape strings,
  when echoed to screen, change the palette. I don't remember exactly
  the sequence but something like "<esc>[RRGGBBP" where RR, GG and BB
  are the primary colors (0x0..0xff) in hex. Possibly [ is actually ]
  (?).
  
  The original palette can be restored with "<esc>[R". (This too 
  is from my faulty memory...)
