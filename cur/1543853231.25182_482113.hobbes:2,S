I've had another look at it, and I believe I have a solution. There is
one assumption I need to verify though.
After del_gendisk() and after I've flushed out any remaining requests,
is it ok to kill off the queue? Someone might still have the disk open,
so that would mean the queue is gone by the time gendisk's release
function is called.
