One of the recent trends in kernel driver development is to make as much
as possible accessible through standard tools (like with echo and cat  
via
sysfs).

 From my point of view, this driver could use sysfs almost entirely  
and put
all of the hardware-manipulation code completely in kernel space, along
with the hardware detection code.  You could have plain-text files in
/sys/bus/platform/dellbios/ that have all of the BIOS F2 options  
accessible
to the admin from the command line, without special tools.  (You could
always add an extra program that presents a BIOS-like interface)

Please ensure that the code is only run on reboot (and maybe halt), but
definitely not in the poweroff code.

This is an _excellent_ reason why more of this should be in the kernel.
What happens if the wrong SMI is used?  Shouldn't it be relatively easy
for the kernel to determine the correct SMI itself?
Thanks for your hard work!
