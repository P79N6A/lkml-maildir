nitpicks:
1) "selinux" is a poor toplevel directory.  We already have the toplevel
"security" directory, this code should go in there.
2) stick includes in the standard include/ directory.  I would suggest
include/security (if the headers are general) or
include/security/selinux.
3) I wonder if the kernel should have a generic hash table ADT?
