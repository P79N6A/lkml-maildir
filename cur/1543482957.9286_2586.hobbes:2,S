Linus, we are in violent agreement: see my previous email. :)  I agree
with both you and Andrea that the atomic_t is not strictly necessary,
and agree vigorously that removing it is wrong because it will just make
the job of fine-graining the locking ever more harder.  As we relax the
kernel locks, the atomic_t becomes more and more important.

Yep, but Andrea did point out what looks like at least one valid race:
sys_wait* on a zombie task can remove and deallocate the task_struct
without taking the global lock.  Reverting the diff is the right thing
for 2.2.1, but once we've done that we may need to look at either
keeping the task lock until we have finished with the task_struct in
array.c, or doing a memcpy on the task while we still have it locked.
That does seem to be a valid fix.
