New patch below defines cpu_has_invlpg as (boot_cpu_data.x86 > 3).
But I do feel safer with that original cpu_has_pge test, which was
using a decent capability flag, and only changed behaviour of the
CONFIG_M386 __flush_tlb_one when it's necessary.
Isn't CONFIG_M386 about maximum safe applicability, rather than speed?
Am I imagining it, or were there a few i386 + i486 SMP machines built?
Or might there be some i486 clone which didn't really implement invlpg,
which could be used with a CONFIG_M386 kernel before this change,
but not after?  But perhaps I'm just dreaming up excuses for my
senselessness - your call.
Hugh
CONFIG_M386 kernel running on PPro+ processor with X86_FEATURE_PGE may
set _PAGE_GLOBAL bit: then __flush_tlb_one must use invlpg instruction.
