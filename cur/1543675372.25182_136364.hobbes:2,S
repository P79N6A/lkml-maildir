Hello all,
	I have an Asus A7V8X Deluxe motherboard with a couple of WD Raptor 
hard drives that I'm trying to get to work with linux 2.4.21-rc6. The 
problem I'm having is that it's REALLY slow and crashy. The kernel reports 
this on bootup:
Uniform Multi-Platform E-IDE driver Revision: 7.00beta4-2.4
ide: Assuming 33MHz system bus speed for PIO modes; override with 
idebus=xx
NFORCE2: IDE controller at PCI slot 00:09.0
NFORCE2: chipset revision 162
NFORCE2: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later
AMD_IDE: Bios didn't set cable bits corectly. Enabling workaround.

The nforce2 ide controller works great, as does the drive on it. When I 
try to use either of the drives on the siimage controller, it brings 
everything else on my system to a temporary halt, and hdparm -t reports 
about 1.3MB/sec reads. This is a bummer, as I was hoping to RAID 0 them 
together and make them my boot drives :)
If I try and enable DMA, the machine instantly hardlocks.
I'm running debian sarge, if it matters.
Is there anything I should try, or is the siimage driver just still very 
early on in its development? I would be more than happy to beta- (or 
alpha) test code, or give developers access to my box if testbed platforms 
are needed. Whatever I can do to make it work :)
Thanks very much in advance
