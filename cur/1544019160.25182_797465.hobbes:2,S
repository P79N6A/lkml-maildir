This indicates that userspace was trying to wait for an event on a pipe that 
was disabled.  There are some fixes in Mesa to help avoid that (especially at 
app startup time); for the most part though they're harmless, since Mesa will 
eventually figure out which pipe to wait on and you won't see additional 
errors.
