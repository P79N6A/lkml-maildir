That's not completly wrong nor is it completly true. :)
You _CAN_ guard yourself from root's breaking out of some chroot environment.
Using grsec (www.grsecurity.net). Denying double-chroots, creation of special
files within chroot-environments and if you like it... Deny mounting within
chroot. :)
There are many options provided - just use 'em. :)
Best regards,
 Oliver
