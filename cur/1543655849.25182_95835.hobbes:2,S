I believe those actions have to be taken.  I haven't seen how flexible
the chips are with respect to which memory they take, which is
generally where most of the complexity comes in.
I have written northbridge memory initialization code that generally
does not depend on the motherboard, I would be very surprised to find
out that video card are generally more difficult (except in the area
of documentation).

Without documentation surely.  Though for that aspect of things
I primarily care about the cheap controllers that are used for onboard
video.  Which I suspect is a much simpler case to handle.
