Any chance you're running spamassassin on that box? I've seen similar issues 
lately and, comparing /var/log/messages with crontab, have concluded that 
sa-learn sometimes kills the box when run by cron. It seems so odd that I 
haven't found the guts to ask about it figuring that I should do some more 
test myself, but I don't have much else to go on...
