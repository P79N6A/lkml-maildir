Subject: [FS] New monitor framework in 2.6.10?

Hi,
i'm maintaining a kernel patch which is monitoring file system activity 
underneath a special directory tree and reporting occuring events via a 
character device to userland where it is processed.
Right now, this patch works via a number of hooks in fs/read-write.c and 
fs/namei.c. 
This is not really efficient at the moment because this way I get an event for 
any written block and not per file which can slow things down a lot.
A couple of days ago I heard rumours about a new feature in 2.6.10 which will 
be exactly for this kind of purpose. Some kind of monitor frameworks that can 
generate events for all sorts of things. Sorry, I don't know any more about 
it.
Is that true? 
Would that be suitable for my task?
And where can I get information about it?
Greetings...
Stephan
