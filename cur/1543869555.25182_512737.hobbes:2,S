I do not agree. Fortunately, the greatest part of the files are written at 
once, so what you usually have is:
Segment 1: [                  data                  ]
Segment 2: [some data] [ D0 DA DB D1 D2 ] [more data]
Segment 3: [                  data                  ]
......
On the other hand, the DualFS cleaner tries to clean several segments 
everytime it runs. Therefore, if you have the following case:
Segment 1: [some data] [ DA D1' D2' ] [more data]
Segment 2: [some data] [ D0 D1' D2' ] [more data]
Segment 3: [some data] [ DB D1' D2' ] [more data]
......
after cleaning, you can have this one:
Segment 3: [                  free                  ]
Segment 3: [                  free                  ]
Segment 3: [                  free                  ]
......
Segment i: [D0 DA DB D1 D2 ] [       more data      ]
Moreover, if the cleaner starts running when the free space drops below a 
specific threshold, it is very difficult to waste more than 50% of disk 
space, specially with meta-data (actually, I am unable to imagine that 
situation :).

Well, our experimental results say another thing. As I have said, the 
greatest part of the files are written at once, so their meta-data blocks 
are together on disk. This allows DualFS to implement an explicit 
prefetching of meta-data blocks which is quite effective, specially when 
there are several processes reading from disk at the same time.
On the other hand, DualFS also implements an on-line meta-data relocation 
mechanism which can help to improve meta-data prefetching, and garbage 
collection.
Obviously, there can be some slow-growing files that can produce some 
garbage, but they do not hurt the overall performance of the file system.

Yeah :) If you have taken a look to my presentation at LFS07, the disk 
traffic of meta-data blocks is dominated by writes.
