No. This is the only one. Even when I enter 'reboot' and hit enter, it
just freezes without any message. For quite a while (more than 5').
Nothing more appears, niether on screen nor on my serial console.

That I tested. No bad block on the remote host (assertion happens
only when writing to a loop residing on a samba share, on a Win2k
host).
> Could you also please run ksymoops to decode the log trace?
Unfortunately no, I haven't got enough place on the machine to test
more than two kernel at a time. Now is time for the 2.4.18-pre7 with
the ext3 debug patch. But this one will get ksymoops run against.
Regards,
Yann.
PS. Because I'm  often away from work in these days, and because my
test machine is a plain old Pentium Pro, I can't do tests as often as
I might want to... Please forgive slowliness...
YEM.
PPS. I'm not subscribed to ext2-devel, please copy me (or lkml).
YEM.
