Are you by chance using procps < 3.1.12? The kernel reports absolute
values for cpu usage, the conversion to percentage is done by top/vmstat
itself. And those old versions don't know about the new fields that 2.6
kernels have in /proc/stat, thus they simply ignore the si and hi
values, producing quite misleading results...

PS: procps 3.1.12 was released in 2003, so if DEC was stone age and my
assumption about your tools holds, then your tools are like... medieval :)
