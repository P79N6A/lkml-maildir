Btw, I hate the name of the helper function for that. "task_is_current()"? 
"current" means something totally different in the linux kernel: it means 
that the task is _this_ task.
So the only sensible implementation of "task_is_current(task)" is to just 
make it return "task == current", but that's obviously not what the 
function wants to do.
So it should be renamed. Something like "task_is_oncpu()" or whatever.
I realize that the scheduler internally has that whole "rq->curr" thing, 
but that's an internal scheduler thing, and should not be confused with 
the overall kernel model of "current".
