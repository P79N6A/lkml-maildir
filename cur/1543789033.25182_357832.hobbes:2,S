I have actually done this
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-scsi&m=112487427230642&w=2
(this is just the bio users, the end_that_request_first/chunk users are 
in another patch).
I am just trying to figure out how to support some wierd scsi HW before 
reposting. If you have suggestions about how to implement the bitmap 
suggestion in that thread I am listening too (I implemented it like 
scsi's scsi_cmnd result field).
