As you obviously noted, the core of the code was lifted from mmiowb().
But no, an mmiowb() as such isn't correct.  At the time this code is
executing, it's on a CPU remote from the one which issued any PIO writes
to the device.  So in this case we need to poll the Shub register for
a remote node, but mmiowb() only polls for the Shub corresponding to
the current CPU.
My first incarnation of this patch (never publicly presented) did
implement a new mmiowb_remote(cpu) machvec instead, and this was
placed in the context-switch (in) path instead of the task migration
path.  However, since this behavior is only needed for the task
migration case, Jack Steiner pointed out that this was a more
appropriate way to implement it.  As migration is much less frequent
than context switching, this is a better-performing method to solve
the problem.
Thanks,
Brent
