Andrew,
Using this test program and changing the type of x to int, long, long long signed and
unsigned the comparison always worked on x86, x86_64, and ia64. It looks to me like
the comparsion will always do what we expect. Unless you see some other problem.
#include <stdio.h>
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
	unsigned long long x;
	
	x =  0x00000000ffffffff;
	printf(sizeof(x) == 8 ? 
		"x = %lld, sizeof(x) = %d\n" :
		"x = %ld, sizeof(x) = %d\n",  x, sizeof(x));
	if (x == 0xffffffff)
		printf("equal\n");
	else
		printf("not equal\n");
	
}
