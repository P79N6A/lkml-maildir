Subject: [PATCH 2.6.19-rc5-mm2] fs/dlm: fix recursive dependency in Kconfig
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/11/18/85

make xconfig says
"Warning! Found recursive dependency: INET IPV6 DLM (null) DLM_TCP INET"
Seems to be another example of how badly the "select" keyword is handled
by the .config make targets. Replace all occurences of "select" in dlm's
Kconfig by "depends on" and some additional help texts.
