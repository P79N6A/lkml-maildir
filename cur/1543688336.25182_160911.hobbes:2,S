Forget it... It had crap in mind. Anyway, my point was actually the
opposite than what I wrote :( I was really to make sure that if a
device is "held" up by pm_users beeing non-NULL, it's _parents_
(and not it's children, sorry about the confusion), are also held
non-suspended... I think I'll sleep a bit and then just go look at
the code ;)
