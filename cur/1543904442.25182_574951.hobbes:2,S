I cooked up following patch - but I do not claim I understand this
code. It was done only by merging the functionality into one function.
I need this patch or a similar one to be added so the weak declaration
of arch_vma_name in mm.h can be made a normal prototype.

[PATCH] x86_64: merge two identical named funtion into one
The function arch_vma_name() is declared weak and thus it was
not noticed that x86_64 had two almost identical implementations.
It was introduced in syscall32.c by: c633090e3105e779c97d4978e5e3d7d66b291cfb
It was introduced in mm/init.c by: 2aae950b21e4bc789d1fc6668faf67e8748300b7
