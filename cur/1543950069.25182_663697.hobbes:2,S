This is something that's been discussed before, originally as part of
CKRM with a complex rule engine in the kernel space.
Basically, the general agreement was that it's a case where a simple
API is going to be too simple for the majority of users, and a complex
API that satisfies everyone is going to be too messy/heavyweight.
This is something that can be done in a userspace daemon via the
process events connector - when you get a PROC_EVENT_UID event, you
can move the process into the appropriate cgroup (you may also need to
check any recently-forked children). This also gives you more
flexibility than you can have in the kernel - you can base your
decision on more complex factors than simply the uid of the process.
Dhaval Giani had a prototype implementation of such a daemon.
