Could you add:
	b_state = 0;
in bforget (buffer.c)? (after or before b_count = 0). I don't know why
it's not been included in 2.2.6. If it helps let me know (I had the
impression to have a memleak here too before I fixed such bug).
Tomorrow I'll reread your email in detail though (now it's time to sleep ;).
