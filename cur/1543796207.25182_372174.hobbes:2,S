While I'm not challenging the possibility of doing this, my timekeeping
work does not provide quite this level of flexibility you imply. Indeed
one could use jiffies as a clocksource, limiting all time users
(including ktimers) to jiffies resolution, but I would consider that to
be abusing the interface.
