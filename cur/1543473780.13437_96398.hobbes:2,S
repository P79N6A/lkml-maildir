Subject: 2.2.0pre2 bug? NTFS and powered down EIDE drives

Folks,
My setup here comprises of a Quantum Sirocco 1.7Gb EIDE drive on hda, and
a Quantum Fireball 2.1Gb EIDE drive on hdc.
On /dev/hdc1, I have an NTFS partition - in kernel 2.2.0pre2, if the drive
is powered down (either through inactivity, or via hdparm) and I then
mount /dev/hdc1, I get the error 'Trying to open MFT' (from line 609 of
drivers/ntfs/fs.c).
Not being an expert on the innards of either NTFS or EIDE, I don't know
whether this is a bug in the kernel or not. All I do know is that it
didn't happen on 2.0.36 :-)
