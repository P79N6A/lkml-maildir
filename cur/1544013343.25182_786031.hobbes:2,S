I don't disagree.  It's about 6 lines of code though, and just hasn't
been at the top of my list.  I'm sure the generic version will be
faster, as it could add checks to see if the holder of the lock was
actually running.

It helps debugging that my standalone tree is generated from and exactly
the same as fs/btrfs in the full kernel tree.  I'll switch to a pull and
merge system for the standalone tree.

Yes, the most important one is the device scan ioctl (also missing the
root check, will fix).

I'll switch to checking against directory permissions for now.
subvol/snapshot creation are basically mkdir anyway, so this fits well.

I think the larger question here is where we want development to happen.
I'm definitely not pretending that btrfs is perfect, but I strongly
believe that it will be a better filesystem if the development moves to
mainline where it will attract more eyeballs and more testers.
