Cool. 
Does that mean that BSD already has page coloring implemented ?
The agony is: 
Page Coloring helps to reduce cache conflicts in low associative caches
while large pages may reduce TLB overhead.
One shouldn't rule out one for the other, there is a place for both.
How did you arrive to the (weak) empirical evidence?
You checked TLB misses and cache misses and turned
page coloring on and off and large pages on and off?
