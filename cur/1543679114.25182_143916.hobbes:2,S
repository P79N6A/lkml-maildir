Oh Murphy! Bug: 250K log buffer causes a hang on boot. 
Sorry for the shock. I configured the log buffer bigger - 250K and it hangs on boot.
Default 14K log buffer all OK, the NBD hang is fixed too.
This was my only config change besides that driver which didn't compile ;)
I want a bigger log buffer in preparation for testing swsusp on 2.5. On 2.4, 
the test io load prevent the big swsusp logs from making it to disk...
Thank you
Regards
Michael
