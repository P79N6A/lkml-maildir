The physical device was spinned down by cdrecord just before ejecting
(same like pressing the eject-button under windows --> bluescreen if
access to the drive.
I think this is a problem of allowing "general SCSI-Device" you must
have for scanners, recorders and so on ... it lets the software do the
hardware-things,
cdrecord seems to have more rights than the kernel, kernel doesn´t
notice that the cd is ejected, he will notice that on next access.
I don´t know too much about kernel-lolevel related things. While in
kernel-setup I thought only my cd-recorder can be accessed by general
scsi device/interface.
I think this option has to be built in so the kernel only lets
cdrecord access the logical scsi-device 0,6,0 (my recorder). What
would happen if I access 0,0,0 (== my Harddisk) via cdrecord?
I don´t have a scanner but i think the software will work like this,
it has full access to the scsi-scanner device (or is a scanner
accessed via logical kernel-device?)
Can someone give me a hint if this what I think is right?
