I think we're arguing over semantics; what's important here is that the
STA tells the AP to buffer frames while we're performing a scan,
correct?

An excellent point.  This is particularly relevant for APs that have a
DTIM interval of 1 -- if you're doing a passive scan, the dwell time on
that other channel (you need at least one beacon interval) could cause
you to miss bufferend MCAST frames.
In all fairness I don't think I've seen any implementations that handle
this cleanly.
