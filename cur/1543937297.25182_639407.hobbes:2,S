Subject: [PATCH -v5 0/2] Updating ctime and mtime for memory-mapped files
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This is the fifth version of my solution for the bug #2645:
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2645
New since the previous version:
1) the case of retouching an already-dirty page pointed out
   by Miklos Szeredi has been correctly addressed;
2) a few cosmetic changes according to the latest feedback;
3) fixed the error of calling a possibly sleeping function
   from an atomic context.
The design for the first item above was suggested by Peter Zijlstra:
> It would require scanning the PTEs and marking them read-only again on
> MS_ASYNC, and some more logic in set_page_dirty() because that currently
> bails out early if the page in question is already dirty.
Miklos' test program now produces the following output for
the repeated calls to msync() with the MS_ASYNC flag:
