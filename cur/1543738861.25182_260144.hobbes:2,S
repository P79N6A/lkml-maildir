Hi,
Here are 5 USB fixes against the latest 2.6.9-rc4 tree.  They do the
following:
	- fix a oops in the digi_acceleport driver
	- fix a SMP race in the ehci_hcd driver
	- fix a lockup in the net2280 driver
	- fix a oops in the usblp driver
	- fix a oops in the hiddev driver
These patches have all been in the -mm tree for the past few weeks
Please pull from:
	bk://kernel.bkbits.net/gregkh/linux/fix-2.6
Patches will be posted to linux-usb-devel as a follow-up thread for
those who want to see them.
thanks,
greg k-h
