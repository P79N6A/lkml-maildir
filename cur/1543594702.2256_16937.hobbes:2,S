Amen.  This is one of the reasons why I also prefer OS/2 over Linux.

Feature Installer is a bad example.  That software is a piece of crap for lots
of reasons, excessive threading being only one, and every OS/2 user knew it the
day it was released.  Why do you think WarpIN was created?

Not quite.  What makes OS/2's threads superior is that the OS multitasks
threads, not processes.  So I can create a time-critical thread in my process,
and it will have priority over ALL threads in ALL processes.
A lot of OS/2 software is written with this feature in mind.  I know of one
programmer who absolutely hates Linux because it's just too difficult porting
software to it, and the lack of decent thread support is part of the problem.

Exactly.  Saying that threads cause bad code is just as dumb as saying that a
kernel debugger will cause bad code because programmers will start using the
debugger instead of proper design.
Oh wait, never mind .....
