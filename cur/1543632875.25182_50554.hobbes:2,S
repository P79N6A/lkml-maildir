New files:
kbuild-2.5-core-17
kbuild-2.5-common-2.5.20-3
kbuild-2.5-i386-2.5.20-2
    Synchronize link order with 2.5.20.  Between 2.5.15 and 2.5.19
    there were several changes to the kernel link order that look
    dubious to me.  Originally kbuild 2.5 for 2.5.20 preserved the
    original order from 2.5.15, but I have since decided to follow the
    2.5.20 link order, even if it looks broken in places.
    common-2.5.20-3 also adds workarounds for include/linux/zlib.h.
