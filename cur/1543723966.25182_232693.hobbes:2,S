Now that John has accepted the LANANA device number request, can you please 
merge this into the BK tree?  It fixes the panics we were seeing with the 
8250 driver and also includes early printk support, which is really nice for 
debugging early boot problems (and, as luck would have it, the ia64 tree has 
one at the moment).
Thanks,
Jesse
