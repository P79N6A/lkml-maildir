Thanks.  I've got genesis-1.10 now looking and digesting to see if you
have any unexpected tricks takes a little longer.
For my purposes I intend to fully disable the BIOS and then after I
have done all of my work, reenable the BIOS.  Which should be a little
easier and have a slightly different set of issues.

except for those BIOS functions that drive the hardware.  For those I
need to setup the legacy PIC back to it's default setting, and
possibly a few other hardware things.   I wonder just how sensitive
the an x86 BIOS really is to changing those things...
For the most part I find it perfectly acceptable if I break all of the
firmware hardware drivers.  As long as the information callbacks are
preserved.  But preserver enough so I could load dos from linux would
be nice.
