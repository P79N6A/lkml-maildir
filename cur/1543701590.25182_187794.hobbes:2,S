Eliminating up to half of the ->poll calls using wake_up_info() and
reducing the number of wakeups using an event mask argument to ->poll
are not the best ways to speed up select() or poll() for large numbers
of descriptors.
The best way is to maintain poll state in each "struct file".  The
order of complexity for the bitmap scan is still significant, but
->poll calls are limited to the number of transitions which actually
happen.
I think somebody, maybe Richard Gooch, has a patch to do this that's
several years old by now.
