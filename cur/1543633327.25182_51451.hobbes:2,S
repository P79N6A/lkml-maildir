ok, the point that *_t is hiding implementation details (when used for
structs is valid). but is there a general consens on not using typedefs
for structs?
if yes, can we _please_ get rid of the *_t for structs.
if no, shouldn't we use the types already defined?
a similar thing will be unsigned (int|short|long|...)
just my $0.02 for the day,
