While vgetcpu() can be used for this most likely glibc TLS is already 
good enough for this. So it will help, but I don't think it's the primary
motivation.

The implementation is x86-64 specific and optimized for x86-64. You could 
probably implement something with the same prototype for IA64 too,
although the internal implementation will likely be very different
(there is nothing x86-64 specific in the prototype) 
AFAIK ia64 supports fast system calls so it might be possible to 
do a simple implementation without vsyscalls.

CPUID 1 is a x86 instruction that is one way to implement a user level
vgetcpu on x86.
