Actually shared pagetables require significant semantic changes in rmap,
e.g. every usage of ptep_to_mm() is broken by shared pagetables and
tracking down assumptions that the (pte, mm) relation is 1:1 is ugly
too. The existing patch for it is not prepared to cope with these.
If they're not already sitting in a back room in ozlabs or Austin
somewhere I'll ship the 3 or 4 singletask 64-bit pagetable OOM's to LTP
etc. to help dispel the 32-bit pagetable space myth, too.
Cheers,
Bill
