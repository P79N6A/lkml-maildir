- users of 2.5 need a new procps but only wchan is "broken" and
  only if CONFIG_KALLSYMS is set anyhow
- I did not kill get_wchan, just do not use it in stat - in fact
  I use it in the new wchan approach, too
- its not an issue now because the updated patch (posted 5 days
  after this email you are replying to) keeps wchan.
So you got your way.  Look at the patch posted 22 Oct.  It is now in
2.5-mm.
