While we're sharing success-stories: I administer a modem-server which 
ran 2.0.31 for ~530 days before a janitor came waltzing in and pulled
the plug to that and 2 other computers. He needed an electrical outlet
for his electric drill and surely couldn't be bothered to use the free 
one 3 feet further away. He probably would have had to fetch more
power-cord to do such a thing, and we can't have that, now can we?
