cool! While you are at it, let me try to enhance the freezer api's
to incorporate the PFE_* flags.

Ok. That's fine by me. Lets get it working first. We can always optimize
it later :-)

A freeze hierarchy! I hope this freeze_level parameter ain't an alternative
to the PFE_* flags because then a task would be in a dilemma as to
what freezing level it should be at, if it wants to be frozen for lets
say kprobes but not for cpu-hotplug. Cpu-hotplug and kprobes
may not have a dependency like the one that exists between cpu-hotplug
and suspend. So, at this moment, even I am not sure if there is a
need for the hierarchy.
