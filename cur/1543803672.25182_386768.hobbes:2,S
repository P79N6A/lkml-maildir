Opportunistic roaming is one of those things that has many knobs to 
twiddle, and depends a lot on the needs of the users. 
But we're not actually in powersave mode -- the 802.11 stack can spit
out the NULL frames to tell the AP to buffer traffic for us. This is 
trivial to do.
Scans should be specified as "non-distruptive" so the hardware driver
has to twiddle whatever bits are necessary to return the hardware to the
same state that it was in before the scan kicked in.  Beyond that, the
scanning smarts are all in the 802.11 stack.  The driver should be as
dumb as possible.  :)
Background scanning, yes -- but there are all sorts of different
thresholds and types of 'scanning' to be done, depending on how
disruptive you are willing to be, and how capable the hardware is.  Most
thin MACs don't filter out foreign BSSIDs on the same channel when
you're joined, which makes some things a lot easier.

With my scenarios, the driver performs the sweep in the order it was 
given -- if the hardware supports it, naturally.

Of course.  The stack is going to need a set of timers regardless of the 
hardware's capabilities, but having (sane) hardware beacon miss 
detection capabilities makes it a bit more robust.

Oh, I know.  I've burned out many brain cells trying to build 
supportable solutions for our customers.
