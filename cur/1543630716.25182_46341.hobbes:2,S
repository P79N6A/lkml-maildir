I have seen this too, with a file system exported with rw,no_root_squash
and mounted hard,intr.  We were running vanilla 2.4.18 on the server
and clients.  We have a text file on the server serving to record
employees' time, and one day the time clock file remained a text file
but was truncated to zero.  All further punch ins/punch outs did not
record in the truncated file (user names, dates, and times should have
appended).  Deleting and recreating the text file on a client returned
behavior to normal.  No error messages whatsoever, and it has worked
fine for two weeks as we watch for the behavior to repeat.
