Subject: Cross-reference analysis reveals problems in 2.4.6pre9

According to my cross-reference generator, the following symbols have
missing help in 2.4.6-pre9:
CONFIG_AU1000_UART
CONFIG_BLUEZ_L2CAP
CONFIG_DDB5477
CONFIG_EVB_PCI1
CONFIG_FORWARD_KEYBOARD
CONFIG_GDB_CONSOLE
CONFIG_HD64465_IOBASE
CONFIG_IT8172_REVC
CONFIG_IT8172_SCR0
CONFIG_IT8172_SCR1
CONFIG_LL_DEBUG
CONFIG_MAPLE
CONFIG_MAPLE_KEYBOARD
CONFIG_MAPLE_MOUSE
CONFIG_MIDI_VIA82CXXX
CONFIG_MIPS_EV64120
CONFIG_MIPS_EV96100
CONFIG_MIPS_ITE8172
CONFIG_MIPS_IVR
CONFIG_MIPS_PB1000
CONFIG_MIPS_UNCACHED
CONFIG_MTD_OCELOT
CONFIG_NINO
CONFIG_NINO_16MB
CONFIG_NINO_4MB
CONFIG_NINO_8MB
CONFIG_ORION
CONFIG_SH_7751_SOLUTION_ENGINE
CONFIG_ST40_LMI_MEMORY
CONFIG_SYSCLK_100
CONFIG_SYSCLK_75
CONFIG_SYSCLK_83
CONFIG_TULIP_MMIO
This list exposes a couple of problems:
1. CONFIG_ORION has been removed from the main MIPS config.in but is
   still referenced in drivers/net/config.in.
2. The MIPS config.in sets CONFIG_AU1000 but does not reference it,
   then references CONFIG_AU1000_UART without ever setting it.  This
   probably indicates that one of these is a mistake.
I have already written help entries for three other symbols CONFIG_DDB5477,
CONFIG_QTRONIX_KEYBOARD, and CONFIG_AGP_SWORKS.  Would responsible
maintainers please supply help entries for the above?
