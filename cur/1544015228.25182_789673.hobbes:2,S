I personally also always found it annoying while grepping that
part of the code is in a completely different directory.
e.g. try to go through TCP code without jumping to .hs all the time.
Long term that problem will hopefully disappear, as gcc learns to do cross
source file inlining (like a lot of other compilers already do)
