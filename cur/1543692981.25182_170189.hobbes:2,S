Hi everyone,
As you might or might not know, the must-fix / should-fix lists have been
inadvertently forked. We are merging them again, so please don't update
the wiki until we have worked out what to do with them. This should be a
day or two at most.
I had the idea that maybe we could put them into the source tree, and
encourage people to keep them up to date by making them become criteria
for the feature and code freeze. Comments?
Thanks,
Nick
