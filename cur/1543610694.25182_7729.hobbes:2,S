I for one believe that Linus was the best person to lead Linux
through the 2.4 series stabilization.  It was bumpy, but who else
could have pulled off the rather deep changes that put 2.4 on firmer
footing?  On the down side, he released some kernels with small but
annoying bugs.  A small price, in my estimation.  Hardly grounds for
disqualification.
If this is such a concern for you, form a post-Linus QA group that
certifies Linus kernels after testing them and applying small
bug-fixes.  Then, you get the benefits of Linus's judgement without
the brown paper bags.  Sounds like a win all around.
If you want to knock Linus[1], I hope you can do better than
complaining about a few bugs.  Demonstrate that Linux would be
better off long-term if Linus had dropped 2.4 after 2.4.0.  I
strongly doubt you can make that case.

[1] Not that it matters in the end, because it's his kernel.  But at
least you should make a respectable argument.
