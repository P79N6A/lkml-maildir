For reference, here's what I get...
 Q> make[3]: Entering directory `/home/cus/rhw/linux-2.2.10/drivers/net'
 Q> gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/home/cus/rhw/linux-2.2.10/include -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer -pipe -fno-strength-reduce -m486 -malign-loops=2 -malign-jumps=2 -malign-functions=2 -DCPU=586   -c -o sk_mca.o sk_mca.c
 Q> sk_mca.c:860: macro `dev_kfree_skb' used with too many (2) args
 Q> make[3]: *** [sk_mca.o] Error 1
Everywhere else that I can find it, that macro only has one parameter,
but just there, it can have two parameters...
Here's my patch against that. The resulting kernel at least compiles.
