2 short function calls instead of 2 "if(current->need_resched)" on the
way out.
I didn't try very hard to fix the inline dependencies, could you try to
move cpu_is_idle() from kernel/sched.c into <linux/pm.h>?
I'm sure it won't be more difficult than the last "Athlon+SMP doesn't
compile" problem ;-)
