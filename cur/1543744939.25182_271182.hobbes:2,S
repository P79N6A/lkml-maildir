I have had quite good luck with the IBM "ServeRAID" controllers, running 
30+ systems with one or two of them and between 1-10TB storage. To 
convince the controller that a drive marked bad really is good does 
require shutting down the system and saying reassuring things to the 
firmware from the console, but it can be done. I'm told that I may be 
able to do that running now, using the control application, but given 
that the servers are spread over four timezones I have no urge to try 
the remote version.
I would like to have some form of hardware RAID on at least what I need 
to boot, so a failure of one of the boot drives doesn't leave the 
machine unable to boot. Particularly with (S)ATA systems which tend to 
fail to the mirror only when the first drive is *dead*, not when it's 
too sick to give good data, but still trying.
