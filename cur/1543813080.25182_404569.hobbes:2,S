hey
there is a bug in the dynsched patch.
(
http://sourceforge.net/projects/dynsched
) the recalculation of the nice
prio must be done before the new scheduler activate the running tasks. 
if you had download it, change scheduler_switch in sched.c like
following:
//add the running processes to the new rq
for_each_process(p){
        nice = sched_drvp->prio_to_nice(p);
        p->static_prio = data->new_scheduler->nice_to_prio(nice);
        p->prio = p->static_prio;
        if(p->state == TASK_RUNNING){
               data->new_scheduler->activate_task(p,rq, 1);
               count_rq_processes++;
        }
}
