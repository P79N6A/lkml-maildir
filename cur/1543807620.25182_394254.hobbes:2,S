i think we might be talking about separate things, so lets go one step
back.
firstly, i think what you call roundrobin is what i call 'global'.  
[roundrobin allocation is what is best for a cache that is accessed in a 
'global' way - as opposed to cached data that is accessed in a 'local' 
way.]
secondly, i'm not sure i understood it correctly why you want to have 
all (mostly filesystem related) allocations within selected cpusets go 
in a roundrobin way. My understanding so far was that you wanted this 
because the workload attached to that cpuset was using the filesystem 
objects in a 'global' way: i.e. from many different nodes, with no 
particular locality of reference. Am i mistaken about this?
