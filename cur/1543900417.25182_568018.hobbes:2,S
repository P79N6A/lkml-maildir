Ok, I can try to split this down further.

We need to give control to the clock events core code once we convert
one clock event device. Having two competing subsystems controlling
different devices (e.g. PIT and APIC) is not really desirable.
The HPET change, which is the larger part of the conversion set simply
because we now share the code with i386, might be split out by disabling
HPET in the first step, doing the PIT / APIC conversion and then the
HPET one in a separate step.
