AFAICR, the BSP is supposed to be logical cpu 0 on all architectures.
Most architectures assign logical cpu 0 to the BSP, even if the BSP has
a non-zero hard_smp_processor_id.  ia64 even has this
int __cpu_disable(void)
{
        int cpu = smp_processor_id();
	/*
	 * dont permit boot processor for now
	 */
	if (cpu == 0 && !bsp_remove_ok) {
