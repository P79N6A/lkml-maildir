Here are some small PCI fixes against your latest git tree.  They have
all been in the -mm tree for a while with no problems.
Please pull from:
	rsync://rsync.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/pci-2.6.git/
or if master.kernel.org hasn't synced up yet:
	master.kernel.org:/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/pci-2.6.git/
The full patches will be sent to the linux-pci mailing list, if anyone
wants to see them.
thanks,
greg k-h
