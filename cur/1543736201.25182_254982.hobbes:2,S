The "2edf" is fine but the "0000" isn't what was _just_ written
to that second register ... some chips are a bit tricky about
initialization.  Ideally, OHCI_QUIRK_INITRESET would be set
for those chips ... the need for that is new, Linux previously
did it in all cases even though only a few implementations
seemed to want it.  (And some strongly dislike it.)
Maybe ServerWorks needs it.  The flag is tested in ohci-hcd.c;
what happens if you kick in that quirk handling?
