Hello,
I now have a much better fix for the "Javastation wont boot new 2.4
kernels" problem which requires no modification to the kernel but rather
to PROLL.
I have made the following files available at:
http://www.sparclinux.co.uk/files/javastation/proll/
proll_14.tar.gz - The normal PROLL straight from Pete's site
proll-14-nfsroot.diff - My patch to allow nfsroot with the newer kernels
proll.mrcoffee.ID14-nfsroot.gz - A mrcoffee binary - UNTESTED!
proll.krups.ID14-nfsroot.gz - A krups binary
(I don't have a MrCoffee so can't test this one).
I think Pete is going to release ID15 with the patch already applied.
My Krups kernel is also at:

Bye for Now,
Ian
