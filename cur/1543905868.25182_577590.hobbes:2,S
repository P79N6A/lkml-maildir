Interesting.  I should have noticed that the first resources looked like
a parallel port.  I've been looking at those recently because they're
also broken :-)
So, the BIOS is telling us that at least as currently configured, the
TPM can't use interrupts.  /sys/devices/pnp0/00:0f/options should have
all the *possible* TPM configurations.  I would guess that none of them
shows an IRQ either.
In general, if the BIOS says there's no interrupt, we should not poke
around looking for one unless we think there's a BIOS defect.  I think
you said that under 2.6.22-rc6-mm1, the TPM didn't find a working
interrupt either.

Yup, I hadn't considered the case of BIOS not telling us an interrupt
for the device.  In that case, I think we should force interrupts off
as you suggest.  Here's the patch I would propose:
