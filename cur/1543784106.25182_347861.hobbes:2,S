Good stuff. Got a couple of small suggestions.
+/* Allocate a buffer with a dma_address.  Don't use dma_alloc_coherent
+ * since that uses GFP_ATOMIC internally and we can tollerate a delay
+ */
+static void *alloc_coherent_buffer(struct server_adapter *adapter, size_t size,
+				   dma_addr_t *dma_handle)
+{
+	void *buffer = kmalloc(size, GFP_KERNEL);
+
+	if (buffer) {
+		*dma_handle = dma_map_single(adapter->dev, buffer, size,
+					     DMA_BIDIRECTIONAL);
+
+		if (dma_mapping_error(*dma_handle)) {
+			kfree(buffer);
+			buffer = NULL;
+		}
+	}
+
+	return buffer;
+}
This should be fixed in mainline, on ppc64 we no longer build the dma_*
ops on top of the pci_* ops. This means we actually look at the flags :)
+	adapter->max_sectors = MAX_SECTORS;
Does this mean we are limited to 128kB transfers? Would it be OK to
bump the default?
