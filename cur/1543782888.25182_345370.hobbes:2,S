This patch has been working fine for me for several weeks now.
I've asked James Cameron, pptp project lead, to try a test to force
the server side to issue a CCP DOWN, to make sure the client-side
kernel ppp_generic module does the right thing and drops packets.  I
don't have a testbed that allows such, but he does.
Thanks,
Matt
