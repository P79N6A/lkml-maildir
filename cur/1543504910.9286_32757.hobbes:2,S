Yes, that is exactly what I meant.  I just said IP because I was
generalizing... ie, the mechanism should work regardless of what
higher-level proto is used, TCP, UDP, RAW, whatever.  So ignore that
part.
As for inetd.conf, assuming inetd is running, it's a good starting
place, as ports will be open that don't necessarily map to any process
except inetd when no connections are open.  That's why I use that...
just to ferret out which program it will END UP being when the
connection gets opened.

I'm already using netstat.  It's the basis of the whole thing.  Based
on that, I know which ports are open and therefore which ones to
analyze.  It's just that I need to match up the port with a PID, which
netstat doesn't seem to want to do with these kernel processes (trying
'netstat -anp' you just get a - where the process name should be), and
fuser won't for kernel processes because... (see below).

That would be a good reason.  :(  Hmmm.... I don't guess there's any
way to keep track of which module answers which port, then.  Yuck.

That's the same problem again... Digging in /proc/net/[tcp|udp], I *do*
find the ports in question, and an inode that they belong to... but I
can't seem go glean anything useful from the inode number.  Thoughts? 
What exactly does it represent?
Thanks again,
