Okay, this is my first kernel project so I didn't know/follow all of the
rules, I admit it is a bit of a mishmash.

The patch and your previous patches look excellent. I have applied them
to my tree and I will be making a new release this evening.

Yes, AFAIK the only places where we rely on the dev not going away are
when we are handling a request from user space. As long as VFS
operations are serialized I don't think we have to worry about that.
