The default settings for the 3w9xxx cards suck.
You need to make sure that the nr_requests (kernel request queue)
is at least twice the size of queue_depth (hardware requests queue).
Also the deadline or cfq i/o schedulers work a bit better for
database-like workloads.
Try something like this, replacing sda with the device name
of your 3ware controller.
	# Limit queue depth somewhat
	echo 128 > /sys/block/sda/device/queue_depth
	# Increase nr_requests
	echo 256 > /sys/block/sda/queue/nr_requests
	# Don't use as for database-like loads
	echo deadline > /sys/block/sda/queue/scheduler
CFQ seems to like larger nr_requests, so if you use CFQ, try 254
(maximum hardware size) for queue_depth and 512 or 1024 for nr_requests.
Oh, remember, if you have just created a RAID array on
the disks, wait with testing until the whole array has been
rebuild..
Mike.
