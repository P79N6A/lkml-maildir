I've had a few problems/issues in implementing kernel 2.4.8-ac8
(and others) and getting agpgart/r128 to work.  I've continued the insanity of
chasing the latest and greatest upgrades, and upgraded to XFree86 4.1.
But I had a similar experience with 4.0.
I have an ATI Technologies Inc Rage 128 PF video card.
The module r128.o needs to have agpgart loaded first and depmod
does not seem to set this up properly.  I've added the line:
"pre-install r128 modprobe agpgart " to my /etc/modules.conf file.
I wouldn't have thought this would require user intervention like this.
My motherboard is FIC AD11 with the AMD 760 chipset, so I had to add
"options agpgart agp_try_unsupported=1" to my /etc/modules.conf file,
which seems to work o.k.
[/proc/pci gives:
PCI devices found:
  Bus  0, device   0, function  0:
    Host bridge: Advanced Micro Devices [AMD] AMD-760 [Irongate] System Controller (rev 19).      Master Capable.  Latency=32.
      Prefetchable 32 bit memory at 0xd0000000 [0xd3ffffff].
      Prefetchable 32 bit memory at 0xdb001000 [0xdb001fff].

  Bus  0, device   7, function  0:
to be precise.]
When agpgart and r128 modules are loaded there are some mtrr complaints
of which I know nothing.  dmesg gives:

Lastly, for all that, agpgart doesn't seem to do much for me -
when loaded in, lsmod shows it as being unused, if r128 is not
loaded.  I have the XFree86 glx module loaded, I think.  I think I don't
understand this at all... without the dri modules agpgart seems
innocuous...so why bother?
Anyways, that's my experience with this; I thought the report would be worthwhile.
