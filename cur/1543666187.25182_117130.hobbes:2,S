Well, fun hack or glibc to-do list candidate, I hope it doesn't get
forgotten.  I am happy to confirm that it did speed up the initial
launch time of Open Office from 20 seconds (2.5-bk) to 11 seconds (-mm6)
and Mozilla from 10 seconds (2.5-bk) to 6 seconds (-mm6).
I did run 2.5.64-mm6 with mem=64M under stress for several hours and it
took a beating and kept on ticking, although quite slowly.
