I've been carrying a change like this for quite some time in a bigger patch,
but never got to actually split it out and submit it. Thanks for doing this,
Thomas! (And yes, it did work at the time it was added.)

while looking at:

I realized that the mtrr.show param cannot work, because
the code is processed much too early.
This patch:
 - Declares mtrr.show as early_param
 - Stays consistent with the previous param (which I doubt
   that it ever worked), so mtrr.show=1 would still work
 - Declares mtrr_show as initdata
