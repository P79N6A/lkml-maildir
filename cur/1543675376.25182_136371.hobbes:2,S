Wow. I feel dumb. When I add the -X66 to tell the drive as well, then 
everything is peachy. Thanks! :)
Now I suppose I just have to figure out how to make that work on boot 
(perhaps just to make the BIOS put them in DMA mode)

I'm running the siimage driver fine with several drives. Your setup is
intriguing in that the BIOS has chosen to leave the drives in PIO mode

Really the SATA drives ought to have come up in UDMA

Thats with hdparm -X66 -d1 ?
The only updates to the siimage driver are those in 2.4.21-ac which you 
shouldn't need.
