In your changelog, explain why you're doing things differently from how 
some people will suggest. That way, when new people read the new thread 
started by your new patch, they see the results of the previous cycle and 
don't rehash old arguments. This also means that people in the future 
wondering why the code is weird there can find out without extensive 
mailing list searching.
