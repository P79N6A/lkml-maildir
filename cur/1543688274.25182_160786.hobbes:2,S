dnsbl           Turns on rejection of hosts found in an DNS based rejection
                list.  If an argument is provided it is used as the domain
[...]
                information.  By default, temporary lookup failures are
                ignored.  This behavior can be changed by specifying a
                third argument, which must be either `t' or a full error
                message.  See the anti-spam configuration control section for

_Anyone_ changing the default behaviour of "temporary lookup failure"
to reject mail should be treated with a really large clue-bat (TM).
