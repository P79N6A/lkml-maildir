 I am fairly sure you have a choice between a steady low and a steady high 
level on the speaker output available if you switch the 8254 to the right 
single-shot mode.  In case you have not been into such details -- the 8254 
offers six modes of operation, selected for each channel separately, of 
which only two are periodic.
