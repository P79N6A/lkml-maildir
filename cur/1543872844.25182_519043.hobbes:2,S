yes, that worked... after booting with root=/dev/sda2 and s/hda/sda/
/etc/fstab /etc/lilo.conf + lilo. didn't mount a /dev/sr0 for a loong
time.
So, are /dev/hd* going to disappear in a few years? iow, does it make
sense to _slowly_ start to migrate to /dev/sd*?
The problem is there's no plan B in case of any troubles except rename
everything back again to boot an old kernel.
