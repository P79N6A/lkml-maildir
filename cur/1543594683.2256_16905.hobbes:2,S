Are you sure about bad memory?
Single-bit errors will be corrected; double-bit errors will generate NMI.
You can also find memory errors with an exerciser.  Unfortunately,
trusty memtest86 bombs on my ServerWorks machine.  Instead I use

which runs in user-mode.  I diagnosed thermal problems by running
this utility.  Within 3 minutes of cold start, it raised main memory
temperature sufficiently to induce a hard error, which was detected
simultaneously by it and the hardware (NMI taken by kernel).
Can you recommend one of your (shorter) tests for me to try?
