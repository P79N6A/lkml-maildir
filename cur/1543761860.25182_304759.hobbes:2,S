The first "#ifdef CONFIG_PPC32" adds some debug fields to raw_spinlock_t.
The debug fields are only used in the pre-existing arch/ppc/lib/locks.c,
and are disabled unless CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK is defined.
CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK is commented out in lib/Kconfig.debug as "# broken,
disable for now".  If CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK is ever enabled it will quickly
become apparent that there are conflicts between arch/ppc/lib/locks.c and
rt_lock.h (compile errors will occur) and the debug fields can easily be
removed from locks.c.
Thus it is OK that you left this chunk out of your patch.
The second "#ifdef CONFIG_PPC32" is in raw_rwlock_t, making the lock
field signed instead of unsigned.  The PPC code uses the value of
-1 to mean write locked, 0 to mean unlocked, and >0 to mean read
locked.  With one minor exception, all of the PPC raw_rwlock_t related
code will work properly with an unsigned type because the code that
checks the value of lock is assembly and treats lock as signed.  The
one non-assembly code that examines lock as a signed object is in
arch/ppc/lib/locks.c and is disabled unless CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK is
defined.  If CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK is ever enabled this will be
very evident as each call to __raw_write_unlock() will result in a
printk() warning.  The strongest reason I could advance for making
lock signed for PPC32 is that any future C code that checks for a
lock value less than zero will not function correctly and might not
be very obvious.
Thus it is also OK that you left this chunk out of your patch.

Yes, -RT should not carry them.  Patch #4 went in via the PPC tree.
Patch #5 is a temporary hack that is only for someone with an IBM 405gp
reference platform who might want to test real-time with an SMP turned on.
