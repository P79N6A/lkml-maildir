I wish you'd stop saying that.  Have you ever done any serious testing?
Here's something to try:  Add a time delay to the end of hub_suspend in
drivers/usb/core/hub.c, so you can provoke a race manually.  Then while
one of your root hubs is being suspended and the system is waiting in
that delay, either plug in a new USB device to that hub or unplug an
existing device.
Be sure that CONFIG_USB_DEBUG is on so that we can figure out what 
happened after the fact.
