So this is one of the boxen where C2 is actually C3 and lapic stops in
C3 mode. Probably BIOS magic.
What's the output of /proc/acpi/processor/CPU0/power ?

Yeah, but it has to be done later in the boot process. Looking into this
right now.

Should happen always as the TSC is driven by the CPU clock and you have
CPUFREQ enabled.

[   11.515305] calibrating APIC timer ...
[   11.618612] ..... tt1-tt2 831283

[   11.618616] ..... calibration result: 532021

[   11.618622] ..... host bus clock speed is 133.0021 MHz.
That looks reasonable. It really boils down to the lapic not working
when going idle.
