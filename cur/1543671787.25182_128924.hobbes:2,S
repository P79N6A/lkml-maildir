OK, but what I want to do is to use a sendfile-like ("streamfile") system
call for streaming multimedia data like video, i.e., sending the whole
file requires large buffers at the client (e.g., 4-5 GB for a DVD video).
Thus, I would like to have a sending/transfer rate equal to the
consumption rate.
Sure, I can use read/write, mmap/write, etc. but these include copy
operations and several address space switches. If I can have a system call
saying "send data segment X to client Y" in one system call and no copy
operations, I'll save resources on a heavily loaded machine.....

Maybe, but then I'll have two system calls...
