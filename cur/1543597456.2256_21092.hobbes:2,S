You want "cramfsboot" to boot cramfs root partitions directly.
(You'll also need the cramfs patch which is part of the Midori Linux
kernel package.)
ftp://midori.transmeta.com/midori-1.0.0-beta2/apps/cramfsboot-0.2_ML1.0.0-beta2-5.mlz
(It's a tarball.)
There are also several packages that handle upgrades of cramfs
partitions, etc.
