more relevant is a large multithreaded (or async model with many
connections per thread/process) webserver spawning cgi.  otherwise you pay
the costs of duplicating the mm and even if you use F_CLOEXEC (which has a
cost-per-connection) you have to pay for scanning the open fds.
if you look at such webservers they tend to have a separate process just
for the purpose of spawning cgi/etc. and use some IPC to pass the data to
the cgi spawner.
