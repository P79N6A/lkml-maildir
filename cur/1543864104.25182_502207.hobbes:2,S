Fair enough; I don't recall that I actually saw a spec saying that.

They should refuse.

Something like that, yes.  It might be nice to have a KERN_DEBUG message
saying which flags were troublesome; production systems will of course
never trigger those failures, so there's no point in having a message
that's not automagically compiled-out.

If a driver wants a repeating 32-bit pattern, they should just
provide a properly initialized tx buffer.

I wouldn't mind a single bit flag either, saying whether to shift
out all ones or all zeroes.  The controller driver would morph it
to something appropriate ... 0xff, 0xffffffff, etc.

The SPI_LSB_FIRST flag describes bit order on the wire.
In-memory bit ordering should be native/CPU bit order
(which may be slightly unclear).  So the confusion is
not for 8, 16, or 32 bit words ... but 9, 12, 20, and
other sample sizes.

No, the point is to alow portable drivers.  So that must be
specified.  What I'm writing up is that it must be right
justified, so its the MSBs that are undefined (for RX) or
ignored (TX).

OK.

Thanks, I'll eyeball it and merge some version.
