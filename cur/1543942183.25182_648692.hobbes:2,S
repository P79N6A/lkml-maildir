Indeed, that would work too...  though we would need to put out a call 
for Gigabyte testers during 2.6.25-rc.
It is an entirely reasonable scenario for NVIDIA to deploy a fix to 
Gigabyte, which would then return us to the same scenario we have today: 
  some work and some don't.
That's my main reason for leaning more conservative here.
