Not sure about that call here. Does the state need to be set so that
you won't be run again immediately? In any case, I think direct
schedule() callers are discouraged? Do you want to call a yield() or
schedule_timeout({0,1}) instead maybe?

I think you are using 2 jiffies to guarantee that at least one jiffy
elapses, which is fine. But, if you do not set the state beforehand,
schedule_timeout() returns immediately, so you have a busy-wait here.
