Hi guys,
I am running the kernel 2.6.21 on my realview_eb system
I got problem at the realview_timer_interrupt():
this interrupt routine is executed 4 times, during one os timer interval.
which means even the real interrupt doesn't happen, the interrupt
routine is still executed.
anyone have any idea where might be the problem?
I have tried a lot but still no idea.
regards,
Yang
