Hi
Sorry for posting this here. I tried e-mailing the authir but the mail
got bounced.
I am trying to get this to compile.
I get the following errors:
In file included from read_cdda.c:71:
read_cdda.h:45: sys/cdio.h: No such file or directory
In file included from read_cdda.c:71:
read_cdda.h:50: sys/scsi/impl/uscsi.h: No such file or directory
I did a find on the file names and my system doesn't have them.
Is there a dependency I am unaware of??
I am using a 2.4.10 Linux kernel.
TIA
John
