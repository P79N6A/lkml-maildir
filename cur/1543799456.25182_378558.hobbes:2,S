Semaphores need a counter, mutexes only a binary representation of the
locked/unlocked state, which makes it possible to use instructions like
xchg, swap, test_and_set_bit depending on what atomic operations are
available on the architecture. On many architectures this is more
efficient than the counter based implementation.
Also the wakeup rules allow smaller and faster implementations for
mutexes.
