The 2.2 kernel can generate aio-like realtime signals upon I/O
completion (see 
http://www.kegel.com/c10k.html
);
you associate a signal to an fd using the F_SETSIG ioctl.
(Those who know better, please correct any mistakes I make here.)
However, you don't have the ability to specify one signal
for one I/O operation, and a different signal for the next,
I think.  And that means you can't tell what the signal
means, i.e. whether the socket is now ready for reading,
or for writing.  I hope I'm wrong about this.
I suppose in practice, this isn't so bad;
you try the likely operation, and if that fails immediately,
try the less-likely one.
