     * Translations of the Press Release. Linux is truely a worldwide
     entity; we need to back this up by announcing the release in multiple
     languages. I'm not sure how the translations would be done; perhaps
     possibly we could borrow translators from the distributions.
A web search for the Linux FAQ or any of the better know HOWTOs should
come up with the names of translators.  The teTeX HOWTO has at least a
half-dozen translations, and the Linux FAQ probably many more than
that.
