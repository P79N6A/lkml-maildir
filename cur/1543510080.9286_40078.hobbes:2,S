How does a user grant crontroled access to a file to a single other user
not in his process group? (or a single user IN the process group, but not
ALL users in the process group?)
Setuid programs are not a safe way to do it since this technique is error
prone, and people do not pay enough attention to the details. Besides it does
not or is not capable of supporting certain file operations in a transparent
manner, the user accessing a file this way must copy it first. Then re-copy
it in case there have been changes... nevermind the possiblility that the
file is a journal/log file that constantly grows.
ACLs are a way a user may choose to grant controled access to file(s) to a
single other user, grant access to a predefined group of users, or deny
access to a user or group of users.
If this is the wrong question, what is the right question?
