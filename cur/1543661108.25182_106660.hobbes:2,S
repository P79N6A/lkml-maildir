then it's fine, the register will be flushed to ram eventually and it
will be within the two wmb(), just write in the example also the line
where the xtimensec ""register"" is flushed to ram and it will be in the
right place
if the register isn't flushed to ram eventually, it will be discared and
the whole critical section is a noop from the point of view of the other
cpus and no wmb() or rmb() or mb() would be needed in the first place
