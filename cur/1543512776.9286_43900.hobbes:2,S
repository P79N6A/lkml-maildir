God no. But if there's some way for the OS to tell the app how long it's 
timeslice is going to be each time it schedules it, then you can do 
interesting things.
Consider an OS which doesn't just preempt and return control later, instead it 
returns control to the same point in a process each time it schedules it - 
with a register set with an estimate of how long the process is going to keep 
the CPU. The process can then return to where it was (special form of 
longjmp?) or start again (rendering a new frame instead of finishing the one 
that's now too old anyway).
This is the kind of thing that I was referring to, and it's not likely to 
happen in Linux any time soon.

If you use all that's available, and react dynamically to the actual amount 
you're getting, rendering at lower quality when you're getting smaller 
timeslices, and rendering at higher quality when you're getting more CPU, then 
you can do fairly clever things. Without setting realtime priority and 
starving the other processes.

None of it is easy to use. It's a difficult problem.
