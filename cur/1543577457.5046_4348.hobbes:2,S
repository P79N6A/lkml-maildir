Alternative reasons for readonly mount include "my hard drive is dying and 
I don't want _anything_ to write to it because it'll explode".
You mount it read-only, recover as much as possible from it, and bin it.
You _don't_ want the fs code to ignore your explicit instructions not to
write to the medium, and to destroy whatever data were left.
