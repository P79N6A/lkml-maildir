Yes, we are still able to reproduce it without calling fork (the new
program just calls
do_pi() a bunch of times, and then we attach and detach to that process)

You seem to need to attach and detach to a program using the fpu -
running pt on a 
process that is just busy-looping over and over some integer adds does
not seem to
while running pi on the machine at the same time, but not attaching to
it does not
seem to affect the floating point state.
