Though 2.6.7 defaults to using APIC, I still get the following with it 
turned on from a Via K8T800 chipset:
Jun 27 21:55:29 palace hda: dma_timer_expiry: dma status == 0x24
Jun 27 21:55:39 palace hda: DMA interrupt recovery
Jun 27 21:55:39 palace hda: lost interrupt
Jun 27 21:57:50 palace hdc: dma_timer_expiry: dma status == 0x24
Jun 27 21:58:00 palace hdc: DMA interrupt recovery
I also saw the following new errors:

I rebooted with "noapic" on the kernel and haven't seen this 
again...yet...  Attaching a small (1KB) .png of CPU usage, notice the 
system time spike around 3:18AM?  This is a 2.6.7 kernel with the 
x86_64-2.6.7-2 patchset.
