Hi Chaps,
I cannot get a newly compiled 2.4.4 kernel to boot. I've searched several
archives but have not found a suitable answer. Can someone please point me
to a suitable FAQ ?
Fails at:
Loading linux .......
Uncompressing Linux... Ok, booting kernel.
<then it hangs>
Same result with kernel versions 2.4.2 and 2.4.3.
Thanks and sorry for asking what must be a common question.
Clive
