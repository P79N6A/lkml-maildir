Sure, but you can't mix that in the same file
with something else. Indentation and braces have
to be consistent. Other stuff matters far less.

Spaces are good for grouping things to increase readability.
So one might do this:
foo(a,b,c,d,e,f);
bar(a+b, a-b);  // space needed for readability
baz(a,b, c,d);  // suppose a and b logically go together, as do c and d
zzz(a==b && c==d);   // common for an "if"
Slapping some arbitrary rule on top of this would
prohibit attempts to make things more readable.
Consider alignment between various lines when
calling similar functions:
foo(a, b+c,          *q, *p);
bar(a, b+c, another, *q, *p);
baz(a, b,   another, *q    );
Sometimes it helps to see things neatly lined up
like that. Sometimes not, of course. The author
needs freedom to lay things out nicely when it matters,
while not concerning himself with trivial spacing
differences when it doesn't matter.
