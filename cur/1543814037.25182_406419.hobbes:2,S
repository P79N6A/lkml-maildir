No such error without your patch on this machine. I've got a RAID5 spanning 
four SATA drives on a dual core Athlon 64, and it'll happily do 185MB/s 
to /dev/null with the command:
for FILE in *; do dd if="$FILE" of=/dev/null bs=1M; done
300,000 interrupts later, still no messages. Anything I can do to isolate this 
further?
