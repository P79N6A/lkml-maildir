Alright, I've really gotten it narrowed down now.
The hard crash occurs only when magicdev is running.  I tried turning
off all my preferences for auto- mounting, running, and playing
data/audio cds in my preferences, and voila!  cdrecord works without a
hiccup in X too.
I will not revert to my nvidia driver for a few days anyway, in case I
can help debug this further -- just let me know what to do.  This looks
like a pretty serious problem, since the upshot is that userspace
programs are able to bring the kernel down.  I'd be happy to help if I
can.
