2.5.74 is some crufty ancient old thing.
ext3_read_inode() got reorganised.  Your latest patch will not apply to
current kernels.
The diff for the current devel kernel is always available at
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.5/testing/cset/
The "gzipped full patch".  You should use that when generating and testing
changess.
There is even a nice patch-script for it:
