I think I found the problem.  Could you try the attached patch?
As I said before FLATMEM is really referring to things like the
mem_map[] or max_mapnr.
CONFIG_NEED_MULTIPLE_NODES is what gets turned on for DISCONTIG or for
NUMA.  We'll slowly be removing all of the DISCONTIG cases, so
eventually it will merge back to be one with NUMA.
