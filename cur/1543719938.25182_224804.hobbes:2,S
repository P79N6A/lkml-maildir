Yes and not... HDIO_GETGEO still exists and report inconsistent
informations. IMHO should be removed. I know this breaks some existing
programs however these programs do not actually works correctly.

EDD 2.0 information consists of
- base port 
- control port
- flags (slave or not)
- others (DMA, etc)
In order to be able (for user space programs) to match these
informations user space programs should be able to read at last base
port of hdX disks.
