If the database threads are at a higher priority than the cpu hog, then no they
shouldn't.  The one that owns the lock should progress as normal.  Assuming that
only the thread owning the lock progresses, the cpu usage ratio between the
threads as a group and the hog should be roughly equivalent to a single database
thread and a single hog.
We certainly shouldn't thrash the yielding threads and starve the hog.
