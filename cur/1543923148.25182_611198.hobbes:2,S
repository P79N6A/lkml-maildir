Hard stuff:
* network character device -- similar to nbd, but for char devices.
  either figure out how to forward ioctls(), or implement
  usb-over-network, or...
* openMosix -- they seem to have userspace solution, but not GPLed.
* compression for ext4. Its about time someone did it right. Special
  bonus if you can do it in a way that it does not slow down. If cpu
  is free, compress, if it is busy, just write it straight to disk.
