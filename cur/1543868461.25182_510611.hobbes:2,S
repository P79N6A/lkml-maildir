This patch has to be split in 2 to make it easier to review -- the change 
moving the event insertion code for the completion queue should stand 
separately, as it is completely unrelated to the rest of the patch.  I 
*think* the patch is right, but picking the changes to the code and watching 
its movement at the same time is making my head spin.
