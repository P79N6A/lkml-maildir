Thanks Douglas!!
So basically the drive was totally unresponsive.
Hardware data point for those interested:
In the space of 3 months i've had 3 IBM SCSI disks just go dead on me! 2
DDRS u2w, 1x DGHS uw. Connected to BusLogic BT-958. (also tried Sym83C785)
In each case the drive has just stopped responding on the bus, and is not
seen by BIOS/firmware or linux on reboot. (but they can still be heard to
spin up normally). Though on rare occasions they mysteriously are detected,
but then die again after 1->2 hours..
My other seagate disks are fine. (in 2 machines connected to APC Smart UPS
420).
Am I just unlucky or are IBM disks a bit fragile?
