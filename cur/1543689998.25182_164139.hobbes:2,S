I tried doing that, but it caused a segmentation violation.  The trouble 
was this line near the start of fs/direct_io.c:dio_refill_pages()
	down_read(&current->mm->mmap_sem);
Unfortunately, in a kernel thread (which is where my code runs)  
current->mm is NULL.
Can anybody offer additional advice?  How about a way to invalidate all 
the page cache entries that contain a page from the file?
