Hmmm, having a look at net/ipv4/ipip.c and net/ipv4/ip_gre.c, neither
one of them does that either.  Do they exhibit the same problems?  How
can I monitor backlog_size?
Presumably whoever called us would have already set that, since
netif_rx() is originally handed the packet to make the decision to
hand it to us?

I could see how this might be a problem...

Should this not be preceded by save_flags() to store and followed with
restore_flags() to restore the flags afterwards? (or whatever it is...)?
Right now I am having other locking problems, I suspect.  See ||ugh
Daniel's post on 'Weekend Edition...' problem report.  Again, ipip.c
and ip_gre.c aren't giving me much to go on...
