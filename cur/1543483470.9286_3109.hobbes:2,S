Subject: Alan Cox ac-series kernel patches - another dumb question

I have another dumb question about Alan Cox's ac-series patches.
It is a general question about patch protocol but can best be expressed in the
form of a specific example.
Are the changes present in the 2.2.0-ac1 patch also included in:
    1) the 2.2.0-ac2 patch?
    2) the official 2.2.1 kernel release?
    3) the 2.2.1-ac1 patch?
If the answers to the above specific example are not indicative of the general
case please say so....
Please cc any reply to my email address given below.
Thanks
Ralph
