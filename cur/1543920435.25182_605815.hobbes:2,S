Actually, I must now take back some of that.
Most of these tests were done a month or two ago.
With 2.6.23.1 running, I just now redid all of the tests.
Now it seems that pciehp fails to notice a newly inserted card
only after a suspend/resume cycle with the slot empty.
I can now get it to work again by just doing:
	1. remove the card, so the slot is empty.
	2. rmmod pciehp; modprobe pciehp
	3. insert the card again -- it works!
So we just need to fix an issue or two with suspend/resume (RAM) in pciehp.
Cheers
