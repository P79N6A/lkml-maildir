I am not sure about it but the NUMA option comes up only when the ARCH
type is set to x86_64. For some reason when I set the ARCH type to x86
then the NUMA option is never present. NUMA is only associated with
x86_64 but I am not sure how it would work if I am trying to run
x86_64 processor in x86 mode.
