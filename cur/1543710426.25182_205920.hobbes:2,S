With my patch though, it gives unmapped pages the same treatment as
mapped pages. Without my patch, pages getting a lot of mark_page_accessed
activity can easily be promoted unfairly past mapped ones which are simply
getting activity through the pte.
I say just set the bit and let the scanner handle it.

Yeah. Hmm, I think it might be a good idea to do this sorting for
unmapped pages on the active list. It shouldn't do ClearPageReferenced
though, because your !PageReferenced pages now get their referenced
bit set, and next time around the scanner they come in above the
PageReferenced page.
I don't like the inactive->active promotion here though, as I explained.
