But assumptions won't change.  Consider your example, 8390.o. 
ethdev_init cannot be marked __init because it is an API function and
might be needed by external modules.  That fact has absolutely no
relationship to whether or not 8390.o is compiled as a module.
If a function is needed by external sources, and it is marked __init,
that is generally a bug.  Even when compiled into the kernel.
IMNSHO this is one subconscious reason why module_init/module_exit were
introduced into the kernel -- to further underscore that modules
compiled into the kernel act the same as loadable binary modules.
__init and __initdata are no different...  they should be treated the
same regardless of whether or not the driver is compiled with -DMODULE. 
(with the implicit understanding that reality will eventually catch up
with theory :):))
