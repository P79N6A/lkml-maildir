Actually I sneakily snuck
git://git.infradead.org/users/jcrouse/geode.git#linus-upstream into -mm (as
git-geode.patch) a month ago - it's been there since 2.6.17-mm3.
So assuming that tree is being kept up-to-date, I don't need to do
anything.  Please arrange for the relevant subsystem maintainers to review
the bits of your tree which affect them (as you have done) and then send a
pull request to Linus at the appropriate time, cc'ing myself.
Unless there are significant bugfixes or this is a new subsystem, the
appropriate time would be in the post-2.6.18 two-week merge window.
And please let me know when there are -mm-affecting changes in that git tree.
Sometimes people add new branches without telling me, or they leave me
carrying abandoned stuff.
