Do that also include the sym53c8xx?
Yesterday I powered up my new server for the first time.  It has two
motherboards with 2 processors on each board (thus the SMP).  Both boards
are plugged into the same 3 channel RAID controller module (the third
channel goes to the array of disks).  While I may try to play with the
Global File System in a bit, right now the RAID module just partitions the
drive array in half and presents one half to one board and half to the
other.
I was just messing around dd'ing /dev/zero over the various drives
presented to the boards.  I found if I started a dd on one board and then
a second on the other the board that was started second would eventually
oops with a lost interupt.
Remember these boards aren't fighting over the same drive space.  The only
thing I can figure is the first dd slows down the transfer rate enough
that the second gets its timing screwed up.  But I don't know enough about
this part of the kernel to offer any real guesses.
(Oh, I'm also receiving a huge number of NMIs and LOCs, just about 1 for
every timer interrupt).  But that might be unrelated, and probally needs
to go in another post.
Oh, one more thing, this was with 2.4.0-test5-pre3.  I'll try again today
with the final test5, and maybe copy that oops by hand.
