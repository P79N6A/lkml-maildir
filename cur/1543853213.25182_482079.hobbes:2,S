device.firmware_data was born when we went to link Linux devices
and ACPI devices using device.platform_data and found it was already used.
You recommended we create a new field to avoid the conflict, and
IIR the discussion suggested that eventually device.platform_data use
would get cleaned up and the fields could perhaps some day be combined.
I don't know if we are any closer to that day, before or after this change.
However, I'm fine with Ben's re-name -- it changes no functionality on ACPI-enabled
systems while potentially deleting an unused pointer/dev on other architectures.
Please ship his patch #2 along with patch #1 that it depends on.
