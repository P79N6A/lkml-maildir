I am getting the same unexplained error message: Can't run
/bin/insmod.old, file doesn't exist, when trying to load jbd.o and
ext3.o. My system is running Redhat 9, and the error occurs with 2.4.21,
and 2.4.22-pre1
I have 2.4.21-rc7-ac1 booting fine. It seems I came across the same
error when first booting from that kernel, but I can't figure out what I
did to make it work.
This is a strange error so I'm not sure what info to post. Not being
able to boot and run on 2.4.21/22 is holding me up from important
projects, so everyone please help, or tell me what info I should send in
order to solve the problem.
