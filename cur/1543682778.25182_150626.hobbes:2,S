I was having the same jumpy mouse behaviuor with 2.6.0-test1, and on an
otherwise idle Pentium III at 600 MHz box, scrolling a very simple HTML
page in Mozilla makes xmms skip audio.
Then I tried 2.6.0-test1-mm2, and several things happened: now scrolling
an HTML page in Mozilla seems not to affect MP3 playback with XMMS, but
this is the only possitive effect. Focusing windows raises them way
slower than in 2.6.0-test1, scheduler starvation is constant (just try
to do something like going to another virtual desktop), and then, after
several minutes, only XMMS got CPU time, the rest of the applications
(at least, those running over X-Window) get stalled.
Hope this helps.
