If the object is to minimise confusion by not showing
back-tracked changes, why not simply allow the user
to mark changesets with a "visibility":
1) hidden, for stuff which shouldn't be seen by default,
   like backed out changes, etc..
2) small, individual development steps to achieve a new
   feature
3) normal, the normal commits
4) major (tagged versions ?)
This way the user can select how detailed the overview
of the versions should be.
Also, when viewing a changeset/version of a certain
priority, bitkeeper could optionally "fold in" the
hidden changesets between the last changeset and the
one the user wants to view.
Would this be a workable scheme ?
(keeps the bitkeeper repository intact, can reduce
the confusion)

Rik
