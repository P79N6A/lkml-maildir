I'd be willing to step up and do this. I have a reasonably large number of
usb devices here to test stuff with, and feel comfortable with the code
base. I have stayed out of the recent URB vs. current argument as I
haven't made many contributions to the main usb core, but agree that we
should switch to it as it does clean up the driver model (I ported my
usb-serial driver to it easily.)
