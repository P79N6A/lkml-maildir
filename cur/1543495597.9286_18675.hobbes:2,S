Hi!
I've put up the 3rd big release of the input patches. It includes
debugged support for USB keyboards, mixing of data from a PS/2 and
USB mouse into one device, so that you can use both simultaneously
under X, LED support (except on USB keyboards), and other nice stuff.
Please try it out if you can.
Get the patch at:

Have fun,
	Vojtech
