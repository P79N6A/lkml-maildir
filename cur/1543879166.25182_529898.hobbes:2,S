Indeed.

It's not a preference - it's more of a supplement.  It's helpful when
some combination of such factors exists:
- kprobe int3-fault dispatching overhead orders of magnitude too high
- fault dispatching not permissible in some areas
- local context variables not easily retrievable via dwarf information
- dwarf information not available at all
- costs of permanently placed but passive marker acceptable
From systemtap's point of view, instrumentation hooked to markers,
kprobes, and other facilities like timers, coexist just fine.  A
greater number of probe-able event sources makes for a richer tool.
