Of course but the CPU speed is a minor cost (unless you run on a
ramdisk and in such case the heuristic should be disabled in first
place since seeks are no cost there :).

Please focus on my above sentence. Waiting time without knowing there will
be a request is a no-way IMHO. Any kind of guess will lose and will harm
the fast path.
I remember you said the larger the seek is, the more probability another
request will happen in the middle. Ok. But the whole point is that you
_can't_ know if there will be another request any time soon unless the fs
tells you about that. The FS is the only entity that can know that
_sometime_.

It's related IMHO because that's nearly the only place where we can't do
readahead and where we do "near" sync requests at regular intervals
(read, wait, read next, wait, read next).
