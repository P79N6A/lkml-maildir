No I'm wrong there. Instead of doing all these migrations and having the
ugly nr_iowait and nr_uninterruptible things I would much prefer just to
migrate the stat when the actual task is migrated. This should take care
of cpu hotplug, and also can make everything consistent.
I'll try doing a patch for that sometime.
