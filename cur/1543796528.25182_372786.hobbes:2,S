Yes, 2.6.15-rc4 restores previous functionality - the error in
$subject is now gone, and it seems the system goes to standby
as it should, without errors and 'standby process interruptions'.
Thanks.
With the only problem which was here all the time - it comes "back
to C" after less a secound all the disks/monitor/etc are placed
into sleep mode..  Ie,
  ..preparing for standby...
  ..hdd stops spinning..
  ..monitor is turned off..
  ..less-than-a-secound-pause..
  Back to C!
  ..the system goes back, restoring interrupts etc...
I tried various 'wakeup' settings in bios, incl. turning everything
off in that menu - no difference.
The same behaviour is shown by all 2.6 kernels I tried so far
(since 2.6.6 or so).
BTW.. It looks like i should change the $subject now.. ;)
