Hi,
I was trying to modify the file ip_input.c. I created a new function of my
own in that file. This function has the following declaration
int switch_check(struct sk_buff *skb)
Within this function I am trying to read the ack value as follows
__u32 ack_value = TCP_SKB_CB(skb)->ack_seq;
However I am getting the following compile errors when I try to recompile
the kernel.
warning: implicit declaration of function TCP_SKB_CB
error: invalid type arguement of ->
Can someone point me where I went wrong.
Thanks,
Rahul.
