If its just linux i would use asynchronous notification using RT
signals. You can use sigwaitinfo to check for the arrival of the
signal by blocking it. siginfo will contain the fd which receivd the
notification. That saves you the call to select as you would have to
select upto maxfd. If you are using just one fd poll would be a better
option IMHO.
