I don't know why SET_PERSONALITY() came to be where it is now, but it
does make some sense to me.  One thing that comes to mind: on ia64, we
normally don't map data segments with execute permission but for
backwards-compatibility, we need to do that for x86 binaries.  I think
there might be a problem with that if SET_PERSONALITY() was done too
late.  Certainly something that could be fixed, but I suspect a
similar ordering issue (perhaps on SPARC?) might have triggered the
current placement of SET_PERSONALITY().
