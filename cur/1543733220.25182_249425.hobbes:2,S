These users I would expect to use a 3D card with open source drivers,
since correctness is more important than performance in these
situations.
I am more interested in using hw-accelerated 3D for GUIs for audio
apps.  It's by far the cheapest way to update banks of meters, etc.  A 
binary only 3d driver is out of the question, it's hard enough to get it
all to work when you have the source...
