Right.

The ppc64 vDSO is mapped with a real VMA bot not mmap call (the vDMA is
built from scratch from binfmt_elf, or rather from an arch callback
issued by binfmt_elf, like the stack VMA). Though should be fine too
though but you may want to double check.

Why 2 ? we map the 32 bits one for 32 bits processes and the 64 bits one
for 64 bits processes on ppc64 without problem ... In fact, Andi could
even re-use our hook I suppose. The way I do it allows also for free
copy-on-write semantics (with mprotect though, I don't set it writeable
by default) so that gdb can put breakpoints in it, etc...
