To clarify, an FMR Work Request is simply posted to the SendQ like
any other Work Request (of course the QP has to be privileged, or
it will complete in error). An SQ Post should never block.
But yes, if the current iSCSI initiator always does all call-based
FMRs in a sleepable context then I would agree then any changes can
wait for the first vendor that wants to support FMR Work Requests.
FMR Work Requests can be pipelined, so anyone with hardware that
supported them would have strong motivation to enable the open
iSCSI initiator to take advantage of this.
