Just to give a litle bit more precise information: this braille terminal
has been designed more than 10 years ago by the Handialog socity which is
now part of the TechniBraille/United Vision group.
Modern VisioBra"lles (with Prom of version 4 or higher) support both a
standard serial port management, and this odd flow control which was
originally designed to be used under MS-DOS, and was appropriate for doing
polling.
The integration of Samuel's patch into the kernel would allow users of
teominals containing a PROM older than 4 to use brltty with their terminal,
which would be a very useful thing, because updating such a PROM has a very
high cost.
Sébastien.
