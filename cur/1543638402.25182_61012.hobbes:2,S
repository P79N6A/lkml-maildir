Looks basically sound. You probably want to use spinlock_irqsave - the
spin locks are less overhead than the reader/writer locks and you don't
really seem to be using it for anything else. I'm assuming we want the
irqsave to block interrupts because the I/O cycles might have to happen
one after another - if not they could be relaxed - perhaps Jonathan
knows ?
