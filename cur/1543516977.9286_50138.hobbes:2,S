I think this concern is addressed (though hardly explicitly) by the
following two sections (in two different manuals!!!):
In section 7.2.2 of the System Programming manual, rule 5 states:
"5. Writes are not performed speculatively; they are only performed for
    instructions that have actually been retired"
In section 2.5.5 of the Basic Architecture manual it states:
"It [the retirement unit] then retires completed micro-ops in their original
 program oder, taking into account interrupts, exceptions, breakpoints and
 branch mis-predictions"
So if I read this correctly, the read instruction (which includes the
actual read from memory) will have been retired before the write is
actually performed so in Linus' example, the actual read associated with
'read b' on CPU #1 can never happen after the actual write associated with
'a = 0' is performed so it can never see the "future" write of "b".
If my reading of this is correct, then it could have been covered by a
new rule (call it 2a) in section 7.2.2 of the System Programming manual:
"2a. Writes cannot pass reads"
