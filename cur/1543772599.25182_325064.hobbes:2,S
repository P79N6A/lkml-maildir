I have one machine inmy lab that turns out to need to boot from /dev/sdq1
trust me, that partition info has LONG since scrolled off the screen by 
the time it fails to mount and panics.
I ended up setting up a serial console to capture the boot to figure this 
machine out, but that's a pretty extreme measure to have to go to.

P.S. I had to do this after grub failed to mount by label (my guess is 
that grub only looks at so many drives before giving up on finding the 
label) so don't tell me that I should just use labels and then I wouldn't 
have to worry about this type of thing
