It requires too much people overhead. I have proposed another idea which is at
about 10 months in or when seems appropriate we say 'ok which bits can we
fairly reliably backport to 2.4 and call 2.6' then go on to make 2.5->2.7 and
stabilise the big changes as 2.8
That would mean driver features and the like get a yearly cycle but deep magic
gets what seems to be needed as a 2 year cycle
