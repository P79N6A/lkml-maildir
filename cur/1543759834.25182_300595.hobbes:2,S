In ext3 this case is handled because the filesystem won't reallocate the
metadata blocks freed from file A before they have been committed to disk.
Also, the operations on file A are guaranteed to complete before or with
operations on file B so fsync(B) will also cause the changes from A to
be flushed to disk at the same time (this is guaranteed to complete before
fsync(B) returns).
I'm not sure how easy it would be to fix this in ext2 without introducing
at least some of the mechanisms from ext3, nor whether there is desire to
do this given the presence of ext3.

If B file was larger than 48kB, and you are filling it with e.g. 0xffffffe
then this could overwrite file A's indirect block from the data in file B.
