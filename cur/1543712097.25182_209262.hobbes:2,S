For Opteron simply placing all cpus in the same sched domain may solve all of 
this, since we will have balancing frequency of the default scheduler.  Is 
there any reason this cannot be done for Opteron?
Also, I think Erich Focht had another patch which would allow much more 
frequent node balancing is the nr_cpus_node was 1.
