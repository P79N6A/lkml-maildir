   Yes, this is a known bug with CONFIG_MODVERSIONS.  If you have
   CONFIG_MODVERSIONS turned on, and you build a kernel, and then you change
   certain options such as CONFIG_SMP, you will get stale *.ver files and
   your build will blow up.
   Workaround:
       copy your /usr/src/linux/.config file somewhere
       make mrproper (or remove your whole tree and re-install it)
       put your /usr/src/linux/.config file back
       make oldconfig
       make dep
       make clean
       make bzImage
       make modules
       make modules_install (if you want)
Another workaround is to do a make clean, followed by an rm
/usr/src/linux/include/linux/modules/*.   This is where the stale *.ver
files live, and they should get cleaned out by a make clean.
A patch to do this to the Linux Makefiles is left as an exercise for the
reader.
