Unless you have configured PREEMPT_RT which requires
PREEMPT_SOFTIRQS and PREEMPT_HARDIRQS such that
spinlock-mutexes are able to synchronize interrupt
processing.  In other PREEMPT_* configuration modes
inclusion of IRQ threads is optional.
I think this may have been the source of confusion in
prior discussions.
