Touching .h files is a kludge.  I have a whole new set of Makefiles
that doesn't touch the .h files at all, and it runs faster than the
existing Makefiles, too.
In the meantime, how about changing scripts/mkdep.c to emit .PRECIOUS
lines for the appropriate files?  .PRECIOUS is well-documented and it's
meant for this problem.  And mkdep.c knows when it is emitting a "touch"
command, so on the next line, it could easily add ".PRECIOUS : foo.h ;".
I don't have time to mess with this myself, but if someone wants to
send me a patch, I can test it.
