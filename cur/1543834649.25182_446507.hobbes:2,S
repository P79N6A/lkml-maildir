Actually, I was curious about that.  I had initially planned on using xchg to
update the counter on the mmaped page, but then it occured to me that an
unsigned long would always be an atomic update (or so I thought).  Is there a
case in which userspace will read a munged value the way the code is now?

Honestly, because it seemed to be a quick way forward.  The real time clock
driver was there, and its infrastructure lent itself rather easily toward adding
this functionality.  If you can elaborate on a better suggestion, I'll happily
take a crack at it.

That is true, but only in the case where someone opens up /dev/rtc, and if they
open that driver and send it a UIE or PIE ioctl, it will start ticking
regardless of this patch (or that is at least my impression).
