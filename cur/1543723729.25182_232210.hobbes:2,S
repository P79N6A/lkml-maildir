Hi.  I'm a list member, subscribed as miller@techsource.com, but I am not at 
work right now, so I'm posting from my spam account.  :)
Anyhow, I'm having a heck of a time getting ALSA to work.  I have an ABIT 
KD7, which has the KT400 chipset. I have determined that the applicable 
driver is "via82xx".  I'm using kernel "gentoo-dev-sources-2.6.7-r7".
Right now, the state is that regular digital audio works, but MIDI refuses 
to work, and some other audio channel is on which produces random clicks and 
other such noise.
There's tons I can tell you about my system, but most of what you probably 
need to know about my situation and what questions have been asked, etc can 
be found by looking at this Gentoo forums discussion that I started:  
"
http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic.php?t=193711".
  Please have a look and 
see if you can't figure out what I'm doing wrong.
Thanks!
