There are several branches of the megaraid driver available.  
(Un)fortunately, it's not one common source file anymore.
For 2.4.x, the driver in BK now (1.18g) is fine.  This has the
backward-compatability stuff for 2.2.x that isn't quite right, but patches 
on linux-megaraid-devel exist to make it sufficient.  See January 2 
archives at 
http://lists.us.dell.com
.
For 2.5.x, the driver in BK now (1.18 + 2.5-specific fixes)  should be
superceeded by v2.00.2 at some point.  This replaces the existing driver, 
and doesn't have backward compatability cruft.  -ac and the OSDL patch set 
have this now (-ac has 2.00.1, minor update for really old iomapped 
controllers is needed).  Since 2.00.2's release around the holidays I 
haven't heard of any problems with the driver - eventually someone needs 
to pull the trigger and submit the switch.
There's also a v2.00.2 specifically for kernel 2.4.x available that drops 
in alongside the existing megaraid, new one is 'megaraid2', to maintain 
stability.
