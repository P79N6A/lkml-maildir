This is really a QEMU question.  I've been focused on making cross-compilers 
and using those to create kernels and a minimal native build environment I 
could use to natively compile packages with.  (The way I designed the thing 
you could substitute real hardware for the qemu step, assuming you had it.  
Or another emulator like armulator for a specific platform.)
I don't believe QEMU emulates parisc yet, although it adds new platforms all 
the time.  (It just grew an alpha emulation last month.)  It's under very 
active development.
