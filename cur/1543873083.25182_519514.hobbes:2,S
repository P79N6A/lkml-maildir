Subject: [PATCH] Remove duplicated code for reading control registers
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Tiny cleanup:
In x86_64, the same functions for reading cr3 and writing cr{3,4} are
defined in tlbflush.h and system.h, whith just a name change.
The only difference is the clobbering of memory, which seems a safe, and
even needed change for the write_cr4. This patch removes the duplicate.
write_cr3() is moved to system.h for consistency.
