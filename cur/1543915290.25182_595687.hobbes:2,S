I have a CAN PCI card installed on my Ubuntu box.
I understand that PCI interrupts should be level rather than edge
triggered.
The output of cat /proc/interrupts is :-
           CPU0
  0:    1614601    IO-APIC-edge  timer
  1:        164    IO-APIC-edge  i8042
  8:          3    IO-APIC-edge  rtc
  9:          1   IO-APIC-level  acpi
 12:          0    IO-APIC-edge  CAN-ACx-PCI_01
 14:      65786    IO-APIC-edge  ide0
169:       3220   IO-APIC-level  eth0, i915@pci:0000:00:02.0
177:      46459   IO-APIC-level  eth1
209:          0   IO-APIC-level  uhci_hcd:usb3, eth2
217:          2   IO-APIC-level  uhci_hcd:usb1, ehci_hcd:usb4
225:        697   IO-APIC-level  uhci_hcd:usb2
NMI:          0
LOC:    1614399
ERR:          0
MIS:          0
You see that irq 12 CAN-ACx-PCI_01 is edge triggered.
Is there any way of forcing the BIOS to see the interrupt as a
level-triggered one?
