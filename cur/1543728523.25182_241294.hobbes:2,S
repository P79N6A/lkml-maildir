This halves all my performance values.
I've just tried 2.6.8-rc4-mm1 with the same results.
I also tested the 2.6.8-rc4-mm1 kernel on a dual P4 Xeon 3.2GHz with
2MB Cache (with HT, so 4 logical processors) using 15K RPM U320
Fujitsu SCSI drives.
[root@minbar root]# hdparm -T -t /dev/sda
/dev/sda:
 Timing buffer-cache reads:   1852 MB in  2.00 seconds = 927.07 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  218 MB in  3.02 seconds =  72.29 MB/sec
[root@minbar root]# ./bw_tcp 127.0.0.1
0.065536 333.85 MB/sec
Ran this 5 times with no real difference in value.
[root@minbar root]# ab -n 100000 -c 2

Ran this 5 times with no real difference in performance.
So a single 2.8GHz P4 HT with a 2.4 kernel has better performance than
a dual Xeon 3.2GHz HT with a 2.6 kernel. I think the SCSI drives
eliminate the IDE results as a factor, so this looks like it's a net
loopback performance issue. Maybe. :)
