Yes, it was related to me unplugging it in the hopes that a re-plug
will make it work again ;)

[See my message to Alan]: It happened twice, within 15 minutes of
boot+login, with 2.6.23-rc3-$whatever .  I does not happen with
2.6.2[123](-rc*)?  After the two incidents, I rebooted in 2.6.23-rc2
and it is working for an hour now.
