+.LP
+The following ptrace commands provide access to the hardware's last
+branch recording. They may not be available on all architectures.
+.LP
+Last branch recording stores an execution trace of the traced process
+in a circular buffer (called Branch Trace Store). For every
+(conditional) control flow change, the source and destination address
+are stored. On some architectures, control flow changes inside the
+kernel may be recorded, as well. On later architectures, these are
+automatically filtered out.
+.LP
+The buffer can be accessed as an array of BTS records from newest
+record to older records. 
+.LP
+In addition to branches, timestamps (in jiffies) may optionally be
+recorded when the traced process arrives and departs,
+respectively. This information can be used to obtain a qualitative
+execution order, if more than one process is traced.

+PTRACE_BTS_MAX_BUFFER_SIZE

+PTRACE_BTS_ALLOCATE_BUFFER
+Allocate a new BTS buffer big enough to hold \fIdata\fP \fBstruct
+ptrace_bts_record\fP entries.
+\fIData\fP must be in the range of 0..PTRACE_BTS_MAX_BUFFER_SIZE.
+If a buffer is already allocated, that buffer is freed after the new
+buffer was successfully allocated. The new buffer initially contains
+invalid entries.
+Typically, a buffer is allocated once when tracing starts. It is
+automatically deallocated when the parent detaches from the child.

+.TP
+PTRACE_BTS_READ_RECORD
+Reads the BTS record at index \fIdata\fP into \fIaddr\fP. The caller
+is responsible for allocating memory at \fIaddr\fP of at least
+\fB sizeof(struct ptrace_bts_record)\fP bytes. The index \fIdata\fP
+must be in the range 0..PTRACE_BTS_GET_BUFFER_SIZE - 1. The bigger the
+index, the older the record; the latest record can always be found at
+index 0.
+.TP
+PTRACE_BTS_CONFIG
+Configures last branch recording from \fIdata\fP in the parent.

+\fIdata\fP is interpreted
