It's dangerous because NTFS is a proprietary format, and the full
rules for updating it (including journals etc) are known only to
Microsoft and those that have signed Microsoft NDAs.  If you update it
incorrectly it gets corrupted and you will lose data.  It's certainly
possible to reverse-engineer these rules, but very difficult and
time-consuming.
