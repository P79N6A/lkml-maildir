OK, so you are not arguing with the "AMD" row, but rather with the
x86 row.  So I was looking in the wrong manual.  Specifically, you are
saying that the x86's "Loads Reordered After Stores" cell should be
blank rather than "Y", right?

Yep.  But I would not put it past some JIT writer to actually do something
like double-mapping the JITed code to two different linear addresses.

Agreed.

Only if there is a context switch between the writing of the instruction
and the executing of it.  Might not be the case if someone double-maps
the memory or some other similar stunt.  And I agree modern cores seem
to be getting less aggressive in their search for instruction-level
parallelism, but it doesn't take too much speculative-execution capability
to (sometimes!) get some pretty strange stuff loaded into the instruction
prefetch buffer.

No argument with your last sentence!  (And, believe it or not, there
was a time when self-modifying code was considered manly rather than
strange.  But that was back in the days of 4096-byte main memories...)
I believe we are in violent agreement on this one.  The column label in
the table is "Incoherent Instruction Cache/Pipeline".  You are saying
that only the pipeline can be incoherent, and even then, only in strange
situations.  But the only situation in which I would leave a cell in
this column blank would be if -both- the cache -and- the pipeline were
-always- coherent, even in strange situations.  So I believe that this
one still needs to stay "Y".
I would rather see someone's JIT execute an extra CPUID after generating
a new chunk of code than to see it fail strangely -- but only sometimes,
and not reproducibly.
Would it help if the column were instead labelled "Incoherent Instruction
Cache or Pipeline", replacing the current "/" with "or"?
							Thanx, Paul
