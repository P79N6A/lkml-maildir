Sorry but there will be number of those once we get the dirty writeback 
for cpusets fixed. Did you review that patchset (only internally mailed

I do not think it makes much sense to do these macros for the single 
occurrence here and otherwise. Having the #ifdef here is much clearer.
Also the #ifdef is in already NUMA specific code.
