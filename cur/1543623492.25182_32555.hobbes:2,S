True. PPP is a sort of "pass through" thing in your case.

Yes. I see your point. It doesn't really make any difference which layer
buffers stuff (unless that layer introduces delays). So I guess in your case
you can just set txqueuelen to 1 if you're sure that underlying layer has long
enough queues.

I see.
Did you try ifconfig txqueuelen 1 ?
