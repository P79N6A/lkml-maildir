I heard one interesting presentation by John Mashey which basically
maintains that the capacity of disks increases its growth rate and
grows faster than the disk interconnect speed and faster than CPU
speeds. Disk capacities reached rate of 60% per annum.
So in the long run you will not be able to do traditional fsck  
which scans a volume, which is O(capacity). Journal commit, which   
is O(outstaning_data_size) may be done if we constrain journal size
growth rate. May be I am getting something wrong but this is how
I see things.
Pavel sounds non-scientific and guesses perhaps. But strangely enough
he got it right. We are going to see 144GB disks in two years time.
