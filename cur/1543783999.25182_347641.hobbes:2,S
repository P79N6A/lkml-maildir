I'm not really a big fan of such dummy symbols, those whole point is to 
only enable dependencies, but are otherwise unsused.
The basic problem is similiar to selects, that one has to grep the whole 
Kconfig to find out what modifies the dependencies of a symbol.
If we really want to describe dependencies like this, I'd prefer to extend 
the Kconfig syntax for this:
config FOO
	allow BAR
config BAR
	option hidden
The hidden option would explicitly hide the symbol, unless otherwise 
allowed.
bye, Roman
