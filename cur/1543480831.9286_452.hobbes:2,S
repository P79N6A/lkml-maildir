Checking patches from pre7 to pre8 I noticed something which looks
weird in drivers/block/ide-cd.h.  Namely:
@@ -307,8 +307,7 @@
        /* Drive can read from CD-R/W (CD-E) discs (orange book, part III) */
         __u8 cd_rw_read          : 1; /* reserved in 1.2 */
        /* Drive supports reading CD-R discs with addressing method 2 */
-       __u8 method2             : 1; /* reserved in 1.2 */
-       __u8 reserved2           : 5;
+       __u8 reserved2           : 5;
In other words, if __LITTLE_ENDIAN_BITFIELD is defined then 'method2'
is gone.  OTOH it is still there for __BIG_ENDIAN_BITFIELD.  It is not
likely that both can be right at the same time, especially when the field
comment stays. :-)
Not that this helps me to understand why Alpha does not boot anymore;
changes in 'poll.h' look like a possible candidate. :-(
