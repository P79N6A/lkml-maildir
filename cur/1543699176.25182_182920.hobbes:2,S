That wasn't covered by this: ??
[root@coyote linux-2.6]# grep SENSORS .config
# CONFIG_SENSORS_ADM1021 is not set
CONFIG_SENSORS_EEPROM=y
# CONFIG_SENSORS_IT87 is not set
# CONFIG_SENSORS_LM75 is not set
# CONFIG_SENSORS_LM78 is not set
# CONFIG_SENSORS_LM85 is not set
CONFIG_SENSORS_VIA686A=y
CONFIG_SENSORS_W83781D=y
I just rebuilt, but haven't rebooted to test it yet, a kernel without 
the VIA686 stuff just in case that was getting in the way.  I should 
reboot and see what I've got now.
