Indeed it shouldn't be. Having a two-phase NRU unmapping in the
page table scanning and a maybe better LRU reclamation in
shrink_mmap() may help here, but the CPU cost may put some
people off...
Then again, not having this better memory reclamation is probably
more expensive than having it :)
Now where did I put that asbestos underwear?

Read requests are easily tied to a process, so this could
be relatively easy. Doing it properly before 2.5 may be a
little difficult though ...
