Badley, you've made an unvaluable contribution today.  The least I can
do is punctuate your words with my own thoughts, below:

Hey, I didn't realize that!  It seems so unlikely.

I hear you: if it were slow and buggy, it *would* be slow and buggy.
I had never really thought of it in that way before.

Now, I've heard that too!

And who's thinking about the poor users?  Their upturned faces, full of
trust and love: their shining lack of experience, unstained by harsh
knowledge of programming realities.  These people have needed a voice:
a hero if you will.

Agreed.  Not to put it too harshly, these "kernel hackers" are cruel
overlords, jealously guarding their free code from the users who need it.
It's time for the USERS to rise up and speak.  But who will speak for
them?  Who?

You're right: WE know what we want!  All we need is someone like US:
close to the users, NOT close to the code!

This Viro, he's another one of these oppressive "coders", right?
It seems pretty clear that we need LESS coders making technical
decisions which effect users, an MORE users making technical
decisions!
> I've spent two hours on this problem, and that's absurd
After reading the precision and sophistication of your prose, your
grasp of technical content is clear.  Finding out that you'd spent two
hours on *anything* technical is shocking to me.

Reading this last sentence brought tears to my eyes.  Really.
I think I speak for most people on this list when I say that the kernel
NEEDS people like you like we need devfs itself.  I remember in 2.3, when
we all needed devfs badly, and that's how we got it: we needed it, and
it went in.  Now those same people who didn't want it in the first place
want it removed.
Badley, I ask you in all seriousness: will you take up the challenge,
and fill the gaping hole which we've all felt for so long in the Linux
community?  To give raw, unvarnished feedback, unconfused by the
complexities of code?
I, for one, see the future lies in your posts.
Rusty.
