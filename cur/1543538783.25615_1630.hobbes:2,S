Same number of ticks. The nice 10 one gets scheduled more eagerly, though
(ie the "nice" level does more than just determine the number of ticks: it
is also used to determine relative priorities if two processes have the
same number of ticks to run).
In 2.5.x we'll probably make the timer run at a higher rate, making this
issue go away, but for 2.4.x this was the expedient way to maintain UNIX
semantics and get good interactive behaviour.
