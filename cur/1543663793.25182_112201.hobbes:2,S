   Ok, here's revised one.
    - sync with linux-2.5.45.
    - change default value for use_tempaddr sysctl to 0 
      (don't generate and use temprary addresses by default)
It is applied.
Hmmm, some thinking is needed in order to backport this to
2.4.x due to lack of crypto library.  I guess USAGI 2.4.x
version of this patch uses crypto library from USAGI 2.4.x ipsec?
