Andrew,
Here are more updates for adaptive readahead.
It's not likely to have more big changes, so the next plan is to convert some
accounting items to the statistics infrastructure by Martin Peschke.
[Martin: Sorry for the long delay.]
I'm also playing with the current readahead code, trying to make it more clean
and reliable. I guess it would also be a long journey. It may be better to
wait and confirm if the adaptive readahead works in the wild, before touching
the stock readahead.
Regards,
Fengguang Wu
