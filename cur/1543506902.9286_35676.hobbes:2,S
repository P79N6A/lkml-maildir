Yes, yes, I was tired when I posted, ok?

Yes, I know that, we have applied it to our Solaris/SunOS systems. The
patch for one of our servers wasn't publicly available (too old), so we
had to ask one of our contacts at Sun.

Well, I can't verify this myself.

My point is, that there might be more 'ix:es that has licensed Sun's code,
and that it'd be far easier to fix it in our end, where the source is
free, than in the closed source, propriety loose ends...
If it's hopelessly unfixable, I guess this isn't feasible, but there must
be SOME explanation why NFS seem to work neatly from other clients than
Linux.
