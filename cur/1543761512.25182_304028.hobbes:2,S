I think it's a problem in your code.  I built and ran the following
example module just fine (based on your example, which wasn't the
smallest or cleanest...), with no oops.  Does this code work for you?
Oh, and the pci_find* functions are depreciated, do not use them, they
are going away in the near future.  Please use the pci_get* functions
instead.
thanks,
