They are probably only useful as debug messages - although it 
may be desirable to know when the configuration has been set.
Also... it doesn't make sense to load the configuration only 
in heavy_init - if the configuration is changed then there's 
no way in the module to resend it without powering the device 
down and up. Some sysfs parameters to change configuration 
could be useful... except there's no information as to what 
these settings are.
