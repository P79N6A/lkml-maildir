I've been getting a somewhat random error in a few of the recent 2.5
kernels with SMP machines.  I noticed this on a 2.5.47 bk pull, but I
was also able to reproduce it on 2.5.46.  I haven't tried any earlier
kernels yet.  The LTP gettimeofday02 test sometimes fails with this
message:
gettimeofday02    0  INFO  :  checking if gettimeofday is monotonous,
takes 30s
gettimeofday02    1  FAIL  :  Time is going backwards (old
1037138184.846333 vs new 1037138184.843346!
I have not been able to reproduce this on a single processor machine
though.
Basically, all the test does is:
gettimeofday(&tv1, NULL);
while(!done) {
	gettimeofday(&tv2, NULL);
	FAIL if tv2 < tv1
	tv1 = tv2;
}
Any ideas on what could be causing this?
Thanks,
Paul Larson
