yes. I think there are 2 cases.
- copy-on-write case..... OS handles this.
- page is writable and app just rewrites it ...... the app should handle this.

I think it's true. But, in this case, i-cache doesn't contain *incositent* data.
There are inconsistency between L2-Dcache and L3-mixed-cache. At L2-icache-miss,
a cpu fetches data from L3 cache.
This case seems defficult to be generalized...

generic_file_write() does flush_dcahe_page() but no flush_icache_page()...
Then..maybe this will be necessary...
==
	flush_dcache_page(page);
	if (page_mapcount(page) > 0 && page_is_mapped_as_text(page))
		flush_icache_page(page);

But I don't know whether write(2) to mapped text file is expected to work well.

Yes, DMA flushes all levels of cache.
