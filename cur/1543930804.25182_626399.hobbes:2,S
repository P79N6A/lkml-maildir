it means that cpufreq doesn't know the actual frequency (although bios sometimes tells us about the relationship, often the bios just lies through it's teeth); it only knows what it asks for, not what it gets. We know it'll get at least what it asks for, but it can get more than it asks for basically.

it'll get way worse going forward.
(but even on todays systems, the tsc no longer represents frequency, but is some fixed clock totally unrelated to cpu frequency)
