The legacy IDE layer is handled by Bartlomiej so you should direct your
enquiries and requests to him and the linux-ide list.

and while I'm working on libata pata a fair bit the pdc202xx driver is
the excellent work of Albert Lee.
The 20269 has always shown up as a problem for some users but not for
most. Nobody ever really got to the bottom of it to be honest. Please
send Albert your reports about which hardware works and which fails
(<albertcc@tw.ibm.com>) as it may be very useful. In particular the
drive that works appears to be UDMA 100 and the failing one UDMA 133
