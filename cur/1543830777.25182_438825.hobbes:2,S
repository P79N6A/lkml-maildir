Sorry for the delay
(as root) I get
5184  open("/dev/snd/controlC0", O_RDONLY) = -1 EACCES (Permission denied)
5184  open("/dev/snd/controlC1", O_RDONLY) = -1 EACCES (Permission denied)
... (upto 31) ...
5184  open("/dev/sound/dsp", O_WRONLY|O_NONBLOCK) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or d
5184  open("/dev/dsp", O_WRONLY|O_NONBLOCK) = -1 EACCES (Permission denied)
ccontrol0 is
crw-------  1 andi audio 116, 6 2006-06-29 11:49 /dev/snd/controlC0
It also doesn't work as andi
I stuck printks to the EACCES in sound/* and they don't trigger so it must
