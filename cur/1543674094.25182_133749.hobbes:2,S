Cool.
Thank you for the spiffy idea.  I implemented this in my (hack/chop) mm5 
tree in about 30 seconds, and it works just fine.  Very simple 
time_after(jiffies, p->last_run + MIN_TIMESLICE) checks in wake_up_cpu() 
plus the obvious dinky change to schedule(), and it worked 
instantly.  Hmm.. I wonder if this might help some of the other scheduler 
(seemingly) bad behavior as well.
Is there any down-side to not preempting quite as often?  It seems like 
there should be a bandwidth gain.
