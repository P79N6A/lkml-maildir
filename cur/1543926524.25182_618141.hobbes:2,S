From our perspective, the main issue is that some of these machines we spent 
quite a bit of money on the big RAM (for it's day) + lots of 15k RPM SCSI 
drives + multi-year support contracts. They're highly IO bound, and barely 
use 10-20% of their old 2.4Ghz Prestonia Xeon CPUs. It's hard to justify 
junking those machines < 5 years.
We have a couple of 6G machines and some 8G machines using PAE. On the 
whole, they actually have been working really well (hmmm, apart from the 
recent dirty pages issue + reiserfs data=journal leaks + inodes in lowmem 
limits)
