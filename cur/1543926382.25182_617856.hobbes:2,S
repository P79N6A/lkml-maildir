Yeah, I was talking about the hot paths. That's the only place where
raw vs. non-raw performance matters.

Exactly. If we add two (quite reasonable) restrictions:
  * The GPIO framework must ensure that GPIO chips cannot be removed
    when one or more pins have been assigned to a client.
  * The client must ensure that it never calls gpio_free()
    simultaneously with gpio_[sg]et_value(), adding locking of its own if
    necessary.
this should be safe.
