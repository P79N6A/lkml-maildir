(there is really no need for name-calling, i was purely describing
technical arguments. I started the development of half of the debugging
utilities which are IKD today - so you certainly cannot accuse me of not
being support-oriented enough.)

debugging tools are not necesserily the most important goal to help the
Linux kernel. IMO we rather need people who have a deeper understanding of
things - even if this makes support a bit harder. If it was up to the
support department then the Linus would drop dead today and only bugs
would be fixed in the kernel tree. Being only support-oriented isnt
exactly helping Linux. If we can do something that helps support - sure
lets do it! But if something contradicts with some other, potentially more
imporant goal, then that other goal takes precedence.
