Nevertheless, it would be good to have a designated security contact
just in case, when something is discovered that needs a more
coordinated form of disclosure.  Death by a single IP packet in the
default configuration, for example.
Local privilege escalation (or even denial-of-service) is not really
relevant.  We know from experience that Linux does not enforce local
account separation and won't do so for the forseeable future, and the
prudent don't rely on it.
