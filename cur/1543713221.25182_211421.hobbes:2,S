Subject: [PATCH] remove the warning from arch/i386/boot/setup.S
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Not sure how many people tried to fix this before, but it's still in
2.6.4.  And guess what, we depend on undocumented behaviour, so I'd
prefer to make this dependency explicit.

reasonable talk, and lead the audience to an unreasonable conclusion.

The warning is correct, the calculated value for ramdisk_max would be
0xb7ffffff instead of 0x37ffffff.  Truncating 0xb7ffffff to 0x37ffffff
is desired behaviour, so we should do it explicitly.
