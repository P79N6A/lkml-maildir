Almost all pci drivers use the pci_find_slot or some functionality that
requires a scan of all the pci devices (to identify their device). I agree
that it is not very often.

I have a question, can this kind of locking used in cases where an interrupt
context may be involved. For example looking through the list of timers, we
disable interrupts and grab a lock using spin_lock_irqsave(&timerlist_lock, flags)
Should we just use __cli() with the RCU or something similar? or  can RCU
be used in such cases?
