My problem is that I just don't see the point. What's the difference 
between 256 and 254 sectors? 128kB vs 127kB? 
Also, looking closer, the current limit actually seems to be _controller_
dependent, not disk-dependent. I don't know how valid that is, but it
looks reasonable at least in theory - while the IDE controller is mostly a
passthrough thing, it does end up doing part of the work. So the picture
look smore complex than just another drive blacklist.
In short, the headaches just aren't worth the 127->128kB gain.
