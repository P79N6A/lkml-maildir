Look at mm/memory.c:map_user_kiobuf. It is used by drivers/char/raw.c,
or by drivers/media/video/bttv-driver.c, for example. It is 2.4 solution.
For 2.2 solution, you have to
(1) pagein page to memory (getuser(c, (char*)addr)),
(2) walk pagetables (yourself, as p[gm]d_offset and pte_offset are 2.3 things),
(3) increment page reference count (get_page(mem_map + pagenr))
I believe that it is implemented by 2.2 drivers/char/bttv.c, and by
vmware's vmmon module.

P.S.: Last week I wrote that incrementing page->count can cause troubles
under 2.4 kernels. I found that you do not have to increment page count,
just shared mappings are not correctly truncated at ftruncate at all...
So you can use 2.2 solution in 2.4 too. But kiobuf is not i386 specific,
so it is preferred solution.
