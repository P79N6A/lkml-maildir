Ok, but I can clearly see an expiration happening for sleeping tasks, like X.  
It looks like it's climbing a ladder halfway, then it sleeps, and when it 
wakes up, it continues to complete the ladder to expiration.  Couldn't this 
sleep be taken into account, and reset the ladder position accordingly?

Most of the time we only run a small number of tasks.  And for the case of 
1000's of tasks, you could put in some lower threshold, that would trigger 
an increase of latency, if the timeslice became ridiculously small.
Thanks!
