As one of the founding members of the X3J11 ANSI committee, and having served
on the committee for 10 1/2 years, I can state categorically that Appendix A of
the original K&R (which was one of the 3 base documents for ANSI C) had the
requirement that non-bitfield fields are required to have monotonically
increasing addresses (bitfields don't have addresses, and different compiler
ABIs do lay them out in different fashions within the words).  C89 never
changed the wording that mandates this.
