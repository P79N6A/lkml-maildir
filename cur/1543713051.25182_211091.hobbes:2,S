I consider "reliable" to mean it returns whatever is
used by /proc and other kernel interfaces. Prior to the
2.6.xx (and late 2.5.xx) kernels USER_HZ did not exist.
On a 2.6.xx kernel, you get back USER_HZ.
On a 2.4.xx kernel with recent glibc, you get
back HZ, which works OK since there isn't any
HZ to USER_HZ conversion.
On any i386 system with the default HZ, you
will get back 100. On older systems, glibc is
just giving you a constant value -- so it is
correct if your system is an i386 without any
non-Linus modifications. An old glibc can only
do sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK) this way.
