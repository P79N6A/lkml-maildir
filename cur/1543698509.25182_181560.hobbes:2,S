The initramfs is the "real root" -- you shouldn't pivot_root from it,
instead you should mount the new root on top of it.
This makes cleaning up a bit of an issue -- the proposed rootfs
mount_single patch takes care of that -- but it can also be done by
leaving a cleanup process with cwd inside the initramfs with would use
relative paths to clean up.
Something like this:
	  mount / /dev/real_root_whatever
	  ( rm -rf . ) &
	  exec /sbin/init "$@"
	  -hpa
