   Unfortunately zero-copy doesn't help to avoid the schedules:
   Zero copy just avoid the copy to kernel - you still need one schedule 
   for each page to be transfered.
The zerocopy patches copied up to 64k (or rather, 16 pages, something
like that) at once, that's going to lead to 16 times less schedules.
The 64k number was decided arbitrarily (it's what freebsd's pipe code
uses) and it can be experimented with.
