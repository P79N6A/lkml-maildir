But I'm sure if that happened you could find a way.
The 'best' way would be for mac.com (and everyone else) to accept mail
submission (and only authenticated mail submission) on the
'submission' port (which is an IETF standard RFC2476).
Then port-25 blocking wouldn't be a problem for you.
Now, it could be that SPF might become a standards-track RFC.  And if
it did (may not be likely, but should be seen as possible as a lot of
people are pushing despite the fact that many push back) then people
would feel justified in implementing it and you might start to find
your mail isn't getting through.
So if you want to be sure of continued access to your mac.com mail
address, I would suggest you try lobbying the mac.com admins to
support 'submission' (I notice it doesn't currently).  Then you can
start using 'submission' to submit mail.  And you can use exactly the
same mail configuration no matter what ISP you are talking through,
and you will be ready in case the crazy loons out there do manage to
convince IETF to move SPF to the standards-track.
		  Don't be held hostage by your ISP.
	   Insist on using 'submission' for mail submission.
