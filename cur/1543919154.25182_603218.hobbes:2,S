I'm sure they're correct, my problem is that how can my driver know what they are?

I was hoping that there would be some compile-time constant I could check that 
would give me this information.

Yeah, I read that article some time ago when trying to diagnose the problem I 
was seeing.  It does explain the point I'm trying to make.  We have a device 
that's used on two product lines: one ARM-based, and one PowerPC.  The ARM is 
little-endian, and the PowerPC is big-endian.  The device can support 
little-endian or big-endian data, as long as the bit-order matches the byte-order.
For now, I'm going to have to assume that they do match.
