at me .. 
I kompiled a Ben0 Kernel with ext3 support and then I made tune2fs to
convert ext2 to ext3 partitions by making a .journal - file! 
After 45 min after the reboot the ext3 system, the IBook freezes at havy
disk/IO (an untar at OpenOffice source , tar.gz 100MB, Sourcetree
550MB).
The IBook freezed and I reseted it .. but I had to install the whole
system .. the yaboot wasn't able to find a kernel on the / Partition.
(ext3 too) :)
