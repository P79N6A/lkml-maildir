Ok, they exist, but they are the 20% not the 80% case, and for that 
reason preserving order in hashing is a legitimate optimization.

Subdir games won't help you if the names are random ordered.
If names are truly random ordered, then the only optimization that can 
help is compression so as to cause the working set to still fit into RAM.
Compression will be sometime later than Reiser4, unless an unexpected 
sponsor comes along, but we will do it eventually.
