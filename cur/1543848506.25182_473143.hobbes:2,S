Adrian --
Two separate problems, please do not confuse them.
My tda10086 and tda826x patches are correct -- there is no question of it.
I did not get an email from you with a suggestion for a fix for 
DVB_FE_CUSTOMIZE, but my cable / internet has been down for a day and a 
half, maybe it will come in soon.
I am not the author of DVB_FE_CUSTOMIZE, adq (cc added) seems to be busy 
at the moment.  Please send in your patch suggestion to the 
v4l-dvb-maintainer list, if you haven't already, and we can discuss that 
issue separately.
