Coincidence, I was bashing the #debian channel today with this problem
too. Used 'lynx -source www.iu.nl/nl' as testcase. After ignoring 
"it's ECN, you moron" and some tcpdump analyses, turned out to be 2.6.8.1
related. I really hope someone explains in this thread if 2.6.8.1 needs 
some extra configuring compared to 2.6.7 or either point to a patch or
so.
