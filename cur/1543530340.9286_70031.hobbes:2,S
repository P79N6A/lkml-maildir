Hello everyone,
reiserfs 3.6.2 (linux kernel 2.3.51) is available for download from:
ftp://ftp.devlinux.com/pub/namesys/2.3-beta/linux-2.3.51-reiserfs-3.6.2-patch.gz
It has some stability fixes that we wanted to get out quickly.  The VFS
cleanup is still in progress, but none of it is in this release.  The
biggest fixes are in the tail packing code.  It is much cleaner, and
easier to verify as deadlock free.  Other fixes are for bugs using device
files, and detecting old format filesystems.
Please send any bug reports to reiserfs@devlinux.com
thanks,
Chris
