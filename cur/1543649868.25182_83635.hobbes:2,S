Which shmctl() test is this?  To my knowledge, there are no current
known issues with shmctl tests.  There is however one with sem02 in
semctl() that last I heard has been partially fixed in the kernel and
still needs to be fixed in glibc.  Is that the one you are referring to,
or is there really some other shmctl test in LTP that is failing?
Thanks,
