Hi,
you disabled CONFIG_KALLSYMS in your kernel configuration, which means
the backtrace isn't really useful for anyone to look at (unless you run
ksymoops with the exact System.map)... the problem is that it only shows
the addresses of the bad guys, but not the names. Those addresses are
different for each compilation, and you can use YOUR System.map file to
decode. However it's a lot more robust to let the kernel decode it for
you by enabling CONFIG_KALLSYMS....
