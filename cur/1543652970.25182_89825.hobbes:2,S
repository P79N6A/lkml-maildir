TCPHPAcks - An ack received in TCP fast path. i.e. 
	    header prediction path. In sequence ack
	    that moves the window. See tcp_ack()
	    in tcp_input.c.
TCPPureAcks - Pure ack recvd (i.e. no data was sent).
            This excludes the above category.
I am working on documenting this stuff. Probably a couple
of weeks away. 
I also suggest posting to netdev@oss.sgi.com, which is the
mailing list targeted to networking developers, or even
linux-net@vger.kernel.org, which is the mailing list most
networking users post problem reports and questions on.
Your chances of reaching a networking person who has time to
answer the question are greater :).
thanks,
Nivedita
