Subject: random ioctls - are they supposed to be like this?

include/linux/random.h has:
#define RNDADDENTROPY   _IOW( 'R', 0x03, int [2] )
#define RNDGETPOOL      _IOR( 'R', 0x02, int [2] )
However, these seem to be used differently in practice.
For example, the one user of RNDADDENTROPY I find does:
struct {
	int ent_count;
	int size;
	unsigned char data[size];
} entropy;
if (ioctl(fd, RNDADDENTROPY, &entropy) != 0) {
...
And, looking at the random driver, it does appear to expect
this format.
Now, RNDGETPOOL in the kernel does:
if (get_user(size, p) ||
    put_user(random_state->poolinfo.poolwords, p++))
	return -EFAULT;
...
if (!copy_to_user(p, tmp, size * sizeof(__u32))) {
...
if(put_user(ent_count, p++))
	return -EFAULT;
Which obviously isn't going to work right if you
just pass in a two-int structure.
Am I reading this wrong, or are callers just supposed
to know to use the other interface?
