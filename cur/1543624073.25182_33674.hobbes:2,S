OK, so the .spec in the tarball should be without (for rpm -ta), and
the one left in %_topdir/SPECS should carry it?
Basically why I made the .spec files carry the version was that I have
several trees (linux-2.4-[ac|plain|clean|mystuff] and
linux-2.5-[dj|plain|clean]) and that way I can build the trees without
interfering with eachoter, as all the .spec files, tarballs, RPMs and
SRPMs will actually be named something like
kernel-$version-$extraversion. That way, if you build two trees they
wont stamp on eachother.
