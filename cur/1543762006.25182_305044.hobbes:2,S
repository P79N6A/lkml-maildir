Hi all,
kernel version:2.4.29
board :net4521
wireless card : Atheros
diriver  madwifi-cvs-current.tar.bz2
I built the customized image  from 2.4.29 and  booted from this image
The following sequence restarts the board
modprobe ath_pci xchanmode=0
ifup ath0
The board and Atheros work fine up to this point. After this once we give 
the
command
iwconfig
the system gets restarted. No error messages are printed.
Has any one faced this problem before?
What could be the possible cause?
Thanks in advance
  Govind
