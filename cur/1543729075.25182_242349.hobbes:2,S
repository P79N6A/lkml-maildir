it's a bit of all of this.
If BSD doesn't have a conflicting udelay(), why not just implement one
there instead of a superfluous rename.
DRM_ERR() otoh should have been dealt with by making a core function for the
ioctl with only the really needed/used arguments (probably even such that
the arguments are already copied from userspace) and then a linux and a bsd
specific API wrapper. The BSD one can then easily flip the sign (that's
basically free), it also takes case of DRM_IOCTL_ARGS mess as well and
DRM_COPY_FROM_USER_IOCTL if you do it right.
DRM_CURRENTPID probably shouldn't exist at all, drivers shouldn't use pid's
in general.
