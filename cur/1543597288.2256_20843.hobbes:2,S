So you break binary compatibilty within a _stable_ kernel release just
for the sake of beauty? Besides, this does not only affect VTUND but
also other applications like Hercules. Just recompiling Hercules doesn't
help here anyway, because it (rightfully) refuses to include kernel
headers but (due to the lack of net/if_tun.h within glibc) constructs
the IOCTL command on its own.

Can you tell me why it does not apply here? Just because you happen to
be the author of both the driver (which is, without doubt, very
valuable) and _one_ of several applications using it?
