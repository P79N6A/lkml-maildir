Hammers and Alphas have 48bit virtual and 40bit physical, in the
current implementations.  The most common 48bit address though is that
ide recently moved from 28bit sector addresses to 48bit sector addresses.

I just did.  The values are per arch, but at least for X86 the values are
unsigned int.  Which is 32bits..
