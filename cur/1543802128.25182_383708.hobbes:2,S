 Okay, but a quick look at the initialization functions called from
'init/main.c' shows that some of them does the same thing (test an
error condition, and panic() if necessary).
 Should they be changed to call BUG_ON() instead?
PS: I'm asking becuase I also found several untested returns, I'll
send patches for they too.
