This card isn't found when I boot the machine.  The kernel versions tried
are 2.2.1 and 2.2.10.
Output of lspci:
00:0e.0 Ethernet controller: 3Com Corporation: Unknown device 9200 (rev 6c)
Output of /proc/pci
  Bus  0, device  14, function  0:
    Ethernet controller: 3Com Unknown device (rev 108).
      Vendor id=10b7. Device id=9200.
      Medium devsel.  IRQ 11.  Master Capable.  Latency=80.  Min Gnt=10.Max
Lat=10.
      I/O at 0x1000 [0x1001].
      Non-prefetchable 32 bit memory at 0xf4000000 [0xf4000000].
I may try the newest 2.3 kernel (stability won't bother me actually =)
