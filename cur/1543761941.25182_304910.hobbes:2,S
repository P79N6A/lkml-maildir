But Hugh I think you may still be freeing pgd (PGDIR_SIZE)
regions that you don't quite cover with flush_tlb_pgtables?
I would have thought you'd need something like this:
	if (!tlb_is_full_mm(tlb)) {
		/* This is the full range of page tables we could possibly free */
		start = max(start & PGDIR_SIZE, (floor + PMD_SIZE - 1) & PMD_SIZE);
		end = min((end + PGDIR_SIZE - 1) & PGDIR_SIZE, ceiling & PMD_SIZE);
		flush_tlb_pgtables(tlb->mm, start, end);
	}
But I'll have to go away and look at it more...
