To be fair the discussion on security does get down to real set theory
but at that point most people's eyes (mine included) glaze over somewhat.
You can reasonably quantify the behaviour and correctness of a security
model based upon mathematical principles - if anything its *easier* that
schedulers which are so much based on "feeling right".
Smack seems a perfectly good simple LSM module, its clean, its based upon
credible security models and sound theory (unlike AppArmor). I don't see
why it shouldn't go in.
