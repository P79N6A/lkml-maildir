Let me explain, as a person who did this mistake and deeply
regrets about this.
F.e. in this case you just cannot use kevents in 32bit application
on x86_64, unless you add the whole translation layer inside kevent core.
Even when you deal with plain syscall, translation is a big pain,
but when you use mmapped buffer, it can be simply impossible.
F.e. my mistake was "unsigned long" in struct tpacket_hdr in linux/if_packet.h.
It makes use of mmapped packet socket essentially impossible by 32bit
applications on 64bit archs.
