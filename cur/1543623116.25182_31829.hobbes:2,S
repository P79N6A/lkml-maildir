Subject: Handling of bogus PCI bus numbering

The 2.4 PCI subsystem seems not to handle bogus BIOS-assigned PCI bus numbers 
well. (OK, it shouldn't be necessary for the OS to have to tweak the 
numbering, but alas, it is.)
I've got an IBM Thinkpad 240 and the BIOS incorrectly assigns bus number 0 to 
the CardBus (obviously, bus 0 is the primary internal PCI bus). Because of 
this, it's impossible to use CardBus devices - when one is inserted, its 
device number (00:00.0) collides with the 82443BX Northbridge and Card 
Services understandably gets rather confused, thinking I've just plugged in a 
440BX chip... ahem.
I've emailed Martin Mares (listed as the PCI maintainer in the PCI-driver 
source) a while back but I think he must be busy at the moment. I had a look 
at the source myself with a view to trying to write a patch but had to get 
myself a stiff drink after about 5 minutes to help me recover from the 
shell-shock :o)
(I'm using stock 2.4.17 on the machine at the moment.)
Here's /proc/pci without any CardBus devices inserted:

With a 3Com 3CCFE575CT CardBus 100Mbit NIC inserted, /proc/pci is identical 
except for one extra device at the end of the listing:
  Bus  0, device   0, function  0:
    Host bridge:  (rev 3).
      Master Capable.  Latency=64.  
and the entry for the CardBus bridge, which shows Min Gnt=128 instead of 192.
Card Services (version 3.1.31, from pcmcia-cs.sf.net) reports:
Mar  2 12:10:08 rodin cardmgr[47]: unsupported card in socket 0
Mar  2 12:10:08 rodin kernel: cs: cb_alloc(bus 0): vendor 0x8086, device

Mar  2 12:10:08 rodin cardmgr[47]:   PCI id: 0x8086, 0x7192
when I insert the NIC.
Please cc any responses to me - I can't take the lkml traffic!
Thanks
