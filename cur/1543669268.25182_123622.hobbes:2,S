You can do 2.0 compat with kcompat.  Just needs a couple more compat
macros in kcompat tarball.  I grant you that net drivers are much more
resilient across kernel versions, and are easier to make portable across
the various kernel API changes -- precisely because we've managed to
keep the core interfaces fairly stable, logic- and locking-wise.
SET_MODULE_OWNER is just one more piece of this conscious effort.

In general, the mainline kernel has two conflicting goals:
* maintain source back-compat as long as it is reasonable
* keep back-compat garbage to a minimum, eliminating it where possible
It really comes down to a maintainer decision, unless there is an
overriding decision to purposefully break source back-compat.
To answer your question specifically, SET_MODULE_OWNER eases source
back-compat in general, but it's main user is network drivers.
