Overheat is not neccessarily hardware failure.
You see, I have a notebook. I put pen in it to stop the fan. Hardware
is pretty much okay, but, well, pen does not allow fan to spin.
What's the best behaviour? Throttle is okay.
I take the same notebook, let it compile kernel, put it into my bed,
and cover it. What should happen? Throttle is okay. I'll get warm bed
and compiled kernel.
Is there something better you propose notebook to do.
And now, you have fire at server room. All cpus throtle, then are
burn. Does it matter if they throttled? No.
And now, you have your must-be-running server at university. Its fan
fails. What do you want it to do? Throttle is the best thing. (It
might deliver mail slightly slower, but it can probably handle load
during the night so I can get there).
So it seems to me throttle is always right answer.
