This whole situation is very theoretical, but I think this actually can
happen *theoretically*.
OK, the spin_lock doesn't do any serialization, but the unlock does. But
the problem can happen before the unlock. Because of the loop.
CPU 1                                    CPU 2
    task_rq_lock()
    p->state = TASK_RUNNING;
                                      (from bottom of for loop)
                                      set_current_state(TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE);
                                    for (;;) {  (looping)
                                      if (timeout && !timeout->task)
   (now CPU implements)
   t->task = NULL
   task_rq_unlock();
                                   schedule() (with state == TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE)
Again, this is very theoretical, and I don't even think that this can
happen if you tried to make it.  But I guess if hardware were to change in
the future with the same rules that we have today with barriers, that this
can be a race.
