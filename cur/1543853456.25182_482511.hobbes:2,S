OK, very bizarre.  Another instance of this pattern:
   1. Recent Core Duo Thinkpad (X60, T60, X60s)
   2. tainting wireless driver loaded (ipw3945, madwifi)
   3. fault at "Genu" somewhere in filesystem code
   4. not long after a resume from ram (?)
Not exactly the same backtrace as before
(
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=208488
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=207658
), but pretty
close.
The only things I can think of are:
   1. ipw3945 and madwifi are sharing some 802.11 code, which splats
      this pattern into memory for some reason
   2. some firmware/smm bug which end up corrupting a register (?)
   3. erm?  anyone?
