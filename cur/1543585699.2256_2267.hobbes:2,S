What about the following (it is an estimate):
early nineties  -->  early eighties
18 developers   -->  18 developers
16mb of memory  -->   1 mb of memory
600 mb of disk  -->  70 mb of disk
Most current applications are so huge BLOATAGE that they should not 
deserve to be run just once. :-)
The kernel must try to cope with that and also with its own BLOATAGE.
Human nature is to eat what can be eaten, regardless if it is useful or
not.

What about 'My M$.02' in some decades. :)
Btw, 'decade' comes from Latin 'deca'=10 and dies=days (not sure for
dies). As a result, it should have meant a period of 10 days instead of 10
years. It means a period of 10 days in French.
May-be, a knowledgeable person at this list has an explanation for this
misinterpretation. Could it be due to the word 'decadent' that has a 
very different ethymology.
10 days is too short for getting decadent, but 10 years should be enough,
no ? :-)
