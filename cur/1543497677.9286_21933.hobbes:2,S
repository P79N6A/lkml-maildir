Hi,
it looks like there's some bug in the TCP stack of
at least 2.3.5.
When there's heavy incoming traffic (6kb/s over 33.6),
all outgoing traffic seems to stall forever, eventually
bleeding to death.
IMHO the kernel should at least try to resend outgoing
packages, and not let them reside in kernel memory forever.
There's heavy traffic on the line without any trouble, so
why doesn't it send outgoing data?
