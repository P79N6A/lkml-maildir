The original desire came out of the linux-vserver project.  It allows a
sysadmin to share directories between many vservers/containers and keep
those containers from writing to it, even though the users in that
vserver may have "root" privileges.
This also has the advantage of cleaning up the somewhat hackish "look
for writable-open-files during remount/ro operations".  It should also
allow us to separate the concepts of the user wanting a filesystem to be
r/o and the filesystem _itself_ being r/o because of a r/o device or
some kind of corruption.
