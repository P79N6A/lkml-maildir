i'll quote a few 'digesting' comments of you:
- about the Linux networking code:
" [...] what a mess indeed. "
- about Linux itself:
" The lack of a Kernel Debugger and other basic kernel level facilities on
  Linux make TRG's job about 20 times harder on Linux and take almost 10
  times as long as is possible on NT, NetWare [...] "
- about people who argue that kernel debuggers are not necesserily
  the panacea:
" They seem focused on keeping us in the dark ages. We need tools to
  make it faster and easier for folks to perform kernel development
  and make field support of Linux easier. "
" A kernel debugger will reduce development costs. No one cares what's
  underneath, they just care about getting their stuff out the door and
  reducing the $$$ to support it.  This whole argument is one of control
  and not of technical merit. "
i have trouble recognizing this as a digesting process ;-)
