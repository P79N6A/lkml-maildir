- It seems a major shortcoming that the feature is disabled if
  CONFIG_DEBUG_MUTEXES=y.  It means that lots of people won't test it.
- When people hit performance/latency oddities, it would be nice if
  they had a /proc knob with which they could disable this feature at
  runtime.
  This would also be useful for comparative performance testing.
