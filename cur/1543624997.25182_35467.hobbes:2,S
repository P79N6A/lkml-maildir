We don't need fadvise IMHO. That is what open(2) is for. The streaming 
request you are asking for is just a normal open(2). It will do read ahead 
which is perfect for streaming (of data size << RAM size in its current form).
When you want large data streaming, i.e. you start getting worried about 
memory pressure, then you want open(2) + O_DIRECT. No caching done. Perfect 
for large data streams and we have that already. I agree that you may want 
some form of asynchronous read ahead with passed pages being dropped from 
the cache but that could be just a open(2) + O_SEQUENTIAL (doesn't exist yet).
All of what you are asking for exists in Windows and all the semantics are 
implemented through a very powerful open(2) equivalent. I don't see why we 
shouldn't do the same. It makes more sense to me than inventing yet another 
system call...
The Windows NT/2k/XP CreateFile() call is documented at below URL. Search 
for FILE_FLAG_* and there is a nice big table with all the possible access 
method hints one can give when opening or creating a file. Many of those 
make perfect sense to have in the Linux kernel, too and in fact with 
O_DIRECT we already have some of the functionality Windows offers (there it 
would be FILE_FLAG_NO_BUFFERING)
