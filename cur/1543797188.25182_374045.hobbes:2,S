If one boots with 'console=ttyS0', the 'ctrl o' should be handled only
on ttyS0. However, I'm not sure if anyone uses ^O in this situation via
the system console. In our case, ttyS0 is automatically activated via
add_preferred_console in arch/powerpc/kernel/setup-common.c.
If there is a clever way to handle ^O only for the system console, would
such a patch be accepted? I'm currently looking through the code to see
how it could be done.
