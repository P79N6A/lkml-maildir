Richard,
	I did a few experiments using the example (jiq, I changed jiffies 
to do_gettimeofday() ) from Linux Device
Driver, 2nd version (p196). 
	I have two machines m1 and m2. On m1, I run a timer queue (jiq)
module. Then I download a big file from m1 to m2. The timings are
different between before ftp and during ftp.

It shows that
timer queue is still not accurate. So
the conclusion of " you're guaranteed that the queue will run at the next
clock tick, thus eliminating latency caused by system load" is WRONG!!!
	What is your opinion?
