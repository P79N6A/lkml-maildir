You're right, which is why I wouldn't offer it as a general mechanism.  I
was merely offering a method to solve the current issue and fix Masud's
problem.  This solution is good in many cases but dangerous in others.  It
can be used as long as you inspect the original syscall to make sure its
param is just a simple string/int.  True in most cases though.
Note that this method is used, often by common LSM modules, for opening
and handling files from kernel space.  (think persistent labeling on a
generic filesystem).
