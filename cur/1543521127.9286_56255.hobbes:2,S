This comes down to you definition of "best". For long-term embedded
apps. A large component of fitness will be based on how proven and
reliable the part is. Other factors such as power consumption may also
come before niceties such as 64-bit math.
The definition of "obselete" is subject to similar pressures. A Z80
variant may never be obselete for many practical purposes.
