From my point of view, the reason for focussing on this was that 
your scheduler degraded the performance on my machine, rather than
boosting it. Half of that was the more complex stuff you added on
top ... it's a lot easier to start with something simple that works 
and build on it, than fix something that's complex and doesn't work
well.
I still haven't been able to get your scheduler to boot for about 
the last month without crashing the system. Andrew says he has it 
booting somehow on 2.5.44-mm4, so I'll steal his kernel tommorow and
see how it looks. If the numbers look good for doing boring things
like kernel compile, SDET, etc, I'm happy.
