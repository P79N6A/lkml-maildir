Hi Alan,
I planned to do a massive disk replace/relocate action on my machines
soon and part of the plan is having a 160GB Maxtor in some machines.
Got scared by statement above .. :-)
I got myself a 2.4.19-ac3 tree, looked around in the IDE code and wasn't
able to find the answer for my questions:
Any chance of lba48 working on a:
    - Promise Ultra66 (PDC20262: chipset revision 1) ?
    - Intel 82371AB PIIX4 IDE (rev 01) (On P-III BX-chipset mobo) ?
    - Intel 82371FB PIIX IDE [Triton I] (rev 02) (On P-I Triton I mobo) ?
	greetings,
	Rob van Nieuwkerk
