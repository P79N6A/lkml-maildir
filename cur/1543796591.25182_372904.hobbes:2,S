Dear List,
I have looked through all the archives, and have unfortunately not  
been able to
find any answers to my questions regarding using the /proc filesystem.
I would greatly appreciate it if anyone in the know, could spare the  
two minutes
to have a look at my question below, or tell me where I should look  
to get it
answered.
Thanks in advance for your help,
Andrew
