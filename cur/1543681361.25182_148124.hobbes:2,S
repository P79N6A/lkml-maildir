Hi there,
just realised that I forgot to run ksymoops over the sysrq+t output.
the resolved output is attached. (it's big, so I had to gzip it.i sorry ). 
Also, I was wondering if the deadlock I encountered might whave been the 
IO-pausing under SMP systems that people have been talking about? 
thanks in advance.
