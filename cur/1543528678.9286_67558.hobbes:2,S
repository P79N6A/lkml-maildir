We had an Alliant manufactured i960-based Super-Computer here at the
University. It was binned because Alliant didn't, despite a LOT of
patching, ever manage to make it work properly... Now I know this has
little to do with the i960 CPU, but I just thought it was a episode
to tell about...

POWER and PowerPC are in almost all aspects the same; binaries are
mutually compatible to most parts (apart from specific stuff like
AltiVec)
Oh, another strange processor is the RT that's used in IBM's RT machines.
Those are horrible things. I would STRONGLY advice against a port to
those beasts.
But a port to the MCA-models of IBM's RS/6000's is VERY high on my
wish-list, considering the number of RS/6000-machines out there. These
are very nice machines.
