FWIW, distributions generally let you install older GCCs. Hopefully your 
distribution still has 2.95.3 in its repository, so you could install this to 
get a well tested (and probably smaller code generating) compiler for 2.4 
kernels. gcc -V <version> can be used to switch between them, if your 
distributor opts to install to the same prefix.
