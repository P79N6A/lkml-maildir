As long as the page is on the pagevec it should be off the LRU. 
Marking a page PageMlocked requires the page to be on the LRU. So a page 
cannot be marked PageMlocked as long as it is on the regular pagevecs.
Somehow a page off the LRU was marked PageMlocked. Or a new anonymous page 
was allocated and marked PageMlocked and then some later processing put it 
onto the LRU?
Maybe try_to_set_mlocked does work some havoc here.
Could you see if this patch fixes it? This just disabled an optimization 
to set PageMlocked early.
