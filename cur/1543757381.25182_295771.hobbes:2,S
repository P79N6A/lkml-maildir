I used to send this to LKML periodically:
Sending bug report/patch:
=========================
* Some device drivers have active developers, try to contact them first.
* Otherwise find a subsystem maintainer to which your report pertains
  and send report to his address.
* Small fixes and device driver updates are best directed to subsystem
  maintainers and "small bits" integrators.
* It never hurts to CC: Linux kernel mailing list, but without specific
  maintainer address in To: field there is high probability that your
  patch won't be noticed. You have been warned.
