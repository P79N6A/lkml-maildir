Is this absolutely true?  I've never been sure about this point, and I
was rather convinced after reading various documents that once you
program up the MSI registers to start generating MSI this implicitly
disabled INTX and this was even in the PCI specification.
It would be great to get a definitive answer on this.
If it is mandatory, perhaps the driver shouldn't be doing it and
rather the PCI layer MSI enabling should.
