Yes, sounds good. Also, if I understand you correctly, I would suggest
actually taking the size of the disk from the PMBR 0xEE entry itself,
rather than depend on what size the disk reports (perhaps double-check
that it is sane, of course - the more careful the better).
With people doing things like concatenating partitions with "md", the size
of the disk itself is less important than what the partition table was set
up with - even if the size reporting of the disk itself is reliable.
For example, let's say that you create a EFI table on a RAID (striped or
whatever), and that in turn then means that the first sub-disk used for
the RAID will contain (as part of the RAID array) the EFI signature in its 
PMBR, we don't want to look at the GPT at the end of _that_ disk. See what 
I'm saying?
