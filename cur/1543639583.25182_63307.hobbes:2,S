Yes but common multithreaded applications will have at least 1 for
pthreads.

((26 - 5) / 2000) * 100 ~= 1
Benchmarks done in kernel mode (2.4.18) with interrupts disabled on a
Pentium3 running the rdtsc timed benchmark in a loop 1 million times
with 8 unbenchmarked iterations to warm up caches and with the time to
execute an empty benchmark subtracted.

Surely, this patch is better than the old LDT method but much worse than
the 2-TLS one.
So I would use the 2-TLS approach plus my patch plus the syscall and
segment.h improvements of the tls-2.5.31-C3 patch plus support for
setting the 0x40 segment around APM calls.
BTW, are there any programs that would benefit from having more than 2
user-settable GDT entries but that don't need more than about 8?
(assuming we have a fixed flat code and data segment and 0x40 segment)
