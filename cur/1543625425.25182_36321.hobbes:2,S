Still trying to get 2.5.7 to compile for the Alpha.
I've got it down to a handful of undefined symbols at link time, the worst
of which are the "flush_cache" like functions which should be included
from <asm/pgtable.h> but as of now for the Alpha code they reside in
<asm/pgalloc.h>.
So I moved the defines over to pgtable.h, but I find one of the functions
uses the "VM_EXEC" define from <linux/mm.h>.  As luck would have it, mm.h
includes pgtable.h.
What is the prefered method for resolving this?
