Please take a look at the pre-7 code (I think it was in pre-6 too, but I
can't be sure without checking, and I'm lazy).
What happens is that the =busyness= of a region is maintained by having
special "busy" resources that are sub-resources of the actual hardware
resources. This means, for example, that two different drivers can (if it
makes sense - and it might, especially for multifunction devices) carve
out different portions of the same hardware resource.
In particular, look at __request_region() and __release_region() to see
how they traverse the resource tree..
