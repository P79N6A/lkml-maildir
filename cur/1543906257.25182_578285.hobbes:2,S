No, just a.out interpreters for ELF binaries.

Nothing would change for them.
The only thing that would change is that if someone has a a.out system
with ELF executables then they would need to update their ELF ld.so to ELF.
Dynamically linked a.out executables should also still run because they
use a different ld.so.

I'm not concerned about binfmt_aout; just about the special case a.out ld.so 
code in binfmt_elf.
