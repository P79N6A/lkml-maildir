I've got a shell script which does this (I use it to take test patches from my 
build tree back to a pristine source for submission to linus).  I'm afraid 
it's a bit rough and ready, but it takes a given set of changes, wraps them up 
as patches, extracts the comments and applies them as patches to a different 
tree and then inserts the comments.  I wrote it a while ago, so it may be a 
little dusty and lacking in the newer bitkeeper features.
