System time is still rather higher in kernbench, though maybe the
elapsed time isn't degraded so much any more. Not sure if this is
scheduler changes or not, but last time, we isolated a change of
exactly this magnitude to one of those patches (Ingo's IIRC).
I tried "set TIMESLICE_GRANULARITY to MAX_TIMESLICE in sched.c" as
requested, makes no difference really (-max result below).
Kernbench: (make -j vmlinux, maximal tasks)
