My assumption is that all file systems are reachable somehow, e.g. via
some device file. Since you should know fairly well what mess your initrd
may have left behind, the cleanup should actually be quite simple. Even
a "general" cleanup mechanism doesn't look too difficult to me, provided
that you have the access information somewhere (/proc/mount-devs ?).

Yes, and it could even do more clever things than NFS root does right
now. What I meant was that it's trivial to just make a kernel boot
floppy, but constructing something with kernel, nfsroot, and boot loader
is more complex. Naturally, with time, packages and scripts should show
up to simplify this too.

Great, so we're already half there :)
