just wanted to point out that recent news shows that sha1 isn't as good as 
it was thought to be (far easier to deliberatly create collisions then it 
should be)
this hasn't reached a point where you HAVE to quit useing it (especially 
since you have the other validity checks in place), but it's a good reason 
to expect that you may want to change to something else in a few years.
it's a lot easier to change things now to make that move easier then once 
this is being used extensively
