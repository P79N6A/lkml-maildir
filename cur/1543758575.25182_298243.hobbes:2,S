Subject: [PATCH 0/4] Allow reiserfs to work with selinux
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hello all -
I sent out these patches in December, but they were dropped somewhere along the
way. There was only a simple reject from the switch from dentry to inode in
get/set/listsecurity which has been fixed.
I'm posting the following patches against 2.6.11-rc5:
* 01-vfs-private-flag.diff
  - vfs: adds the S_PRIVATE flag and adds use to security
* 02-vfs-private-selinux.diff
  - selinux: internal inode loop needs IS_PRIVATE test
* 03-reiserfs-priv-abstract.diff
  - reiserfs: private inode abstracted to static inline
* 04-vfs-private-reiserfs.diff
  - reiserfs: change reiserfs to use S_PRIVATE
Please apply.
-Jeff
