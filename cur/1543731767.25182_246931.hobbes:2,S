Subject: 2.6.9-rc1-mm1 can't compile a kernel

Seems to crap out with file corruption partway through, saying things
like:
ld -m elf_i386  -r -o utilities.o utalloc.o utcopy.o utdebug.o utdelete.o uteval.o utglobal.o utinit.o utmath.o utmisc.o utobject.o utxface.o
uteval.o: file not recognized: File truncated
2.6.9-rc1 seems to work fine. You got any likely candidates to try backing
out / trying separately? Else I guess I'll try linus.patch.
(test is just compiling 2.4.17 on the NUMA-Q).
But hey ... it makes my kernbench times super-whizzy-fast! ;-)
