ok, i've tried all snapshots starting with today's bk patch. bk[567]
crashed upon x startup. bk[34] crashed while moving windows around (i'm
using the ion window manager, so it got more of a "beam window around").
bk2 and vanillia seemed stable, but both crashed after a short time.
Then I've looked at my /etc/X11/XF86Config-4 and found my "aggressive" AGP
Settings (enabled 'fast write', agpmode set to 4), i'm now running
with bk2 with agpmode set to 2, seems stable. I will try bk-5 after some
working with bk2.
