Probably yes.  I don't have another idea for something /generic/.
Of course there is option to use matroxfb/atyfb/whatever if a native
framebuffer driver exists for your hardware...

vesafb is a very simple fb driver.  It expects to find a initialized vga
and the information "framebuffer memory starts at adress foo, video mode
is 800x600 at 16 bpp".  The initialization is done using the VESA bios by
the real mode startup code.
On PPC (+sparc?) offb does much the same:  Video is initialized by Open
Firmware, offb just uses the configured video mode.
