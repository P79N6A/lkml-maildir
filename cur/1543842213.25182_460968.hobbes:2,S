There's also some interesting high-performance FPGA-based products  
out there which stack another layer or two of reed-solomon coding on  
top of a group of N existing drives so that you can handle up to M  
drive failures where M < N, and optionally also a failure of a stripe  
of up to K sectors out of every group of J sectors.  IIRC your  
average CD and DVD uses this kind of encoding, so if you have a bunch  
of scattered errors or a single big error up to like 9k long you can  
still recover all the data while decoding.  Those kind of matrix  
transformations would be dog-slow on a general purpose CPU, but with  
custom FPGA or VLSI chips you can do it in parallel easily better  
than disk bandwidth
