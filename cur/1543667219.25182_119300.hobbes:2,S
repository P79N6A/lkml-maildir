I have the same kind of machine.  I've seen the same problems, but
they're intermittent; I haven't been able to really discern a pattern.
I have the feeling that part of the problem may be with the machine on
the other side of the connection.
I have no problems copying between two 2.5.65 machines.  In fact, my
speeds are ~10 MBytes/sec.  (yes, megabytes)

Yeah, kirq was causing that and it _was_ broken for a bit.  It should
have been fixed by 2.5.64, though.

I'm running on a full-duplex 100Mbps network, so maybe these things have
some kind of issue with 10Mbps.  I'll try plugging an old hub in and see
what happens.
Here's mine:
pcnet32.c:v1.27b 01.10.2002 tsbogend@alpha.franken.de
pcnet32: PCnet/FAST III 79C975 at 0x2240, 00 02 55 fc 43 20 assigned IRQ 16.
eth2: registered as PCnet/FAST III 79C975
pcnet32: 1 cards_found.
eth2: link up, 100Mbps, full-duplex, lpa 0x45E1
