I still think that is weird and not something that should be merged. The
0x01 bit means load the tray and read TOC.

It has no logical implications other than from what pool it allocates,
and we've always used the WRITE pool for these requests. There's no
protection implications.
WRITEs cannot have length 0, and READs cannot as well. Since it's just
one bit for direction, those are the rules.
