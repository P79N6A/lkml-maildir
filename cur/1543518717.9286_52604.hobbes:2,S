Wrong. The alpha is not creating a single zone. Try to run 2.3.31 on a
ruffian. You'll have the DMA zone and the no-DMA zone. TWO zones. The DMA
zone between 0 and 16mbyte. The no-DMA zone between 16mbyte and the end of
memory or at max 2g.
On other platforms that can do ISA_DMA on all memory there's only one zone
of GFP_DMA. But that _must_ work fine or we are very buggy also on 2.2.x.

The alpha just have a DMA24BIT in the platforms that needs it.
