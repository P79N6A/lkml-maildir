No. The sole role of the kernel in case of broken hardware
(hence, floppies) is to ensure data integrity, not to tell the user
"please insert floppy #adead007". Easing removable media manipulation
would sure be a great plus (for users), but not to the expense of
unneeded and unnecessary tell-user-what-to-do stuff. If it were to
take this path, then IMHO the already mentioned proposal of a kernel
space (ultralight) daemon noticing an userspace daemon about missing
medium would be the best solution.
And even if user space notification and report were implemented and
functional, a user in a hurry is a user in a hurry and would be far
away from the culprit machine before the "please insert" message pops
up on the screen. OTOH, he'd be happy to see that "the floppy I forgot
yesterday" is alive and well...

Sure, turn already-broken hardware into fubar hardware...
