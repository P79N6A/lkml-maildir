I cooked up a patch that calculated the BIOS C*H*S and set lba capacity to that..
It doesn't help though since you still can't do IO access to the disk past the
66055248 limit.

Well actually, the drive reports 65531/16/63 and 66055248 (which is exactly that
CHS multiplied out).  The award bios then translates the LBA capacity to
4111/255/63, and EZ-Drive then reports 4982/255/63 which is much much closer to
the total capacity.  What I really don't get though is if they are clipping the
drive at 66055248 sectors, how in the world do they expect to have it be readable
by DOS above 32GB unless EZ-Drive fixes this when it gets an extended BIOS call
for values over 66055248.  Hmm.. I wonder if it would be possible to boot to DOS
with EZD loaded, check to see if the whole disk is accessible, and if so try
booting Linux from DOS and see if now Linux can see the full capacity.

Yeah, that sounds like what I was looking for.  I will try inserting some code
which does that just before it goes to check the LBA capacity, and see if it picks
up on everything.
