We can't do that, some older boards hang if C1 disconnect is used.
However you can enable fixup and then C1 Halt Disconnect yourself. :-)
setpci -v -H1 -s 0:0.0 6C.L=$(printf %x $((0x$(setpci -H1 -s 0:0.0 6C.L) & 0x9F01FF01)))
- to enable fixup first
setpci -v -H1 -s 0:0.0 6F=$(printf %x $((0x$(setpci -H1 -s 0:0.0 6F) | 0x10)))
- to enable C1 Halt Disconnect
[ this is untested as I don't have nForce2 board ]
