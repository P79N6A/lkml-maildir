Doing without shared runqueues is what I meant. A single runqueue appears
to avoid having to move processes between runqueues, or considering
*where* to move a process.

If Ingo is happy, I am happy. I find shared runqueues very easy to
understand as a way to send tasks to a single HT chip, which is the only
case which comes to mind in which a CPU change is free. Clearly it isn't
going to apply to CPUs which don't share cache and behave more like
individual packages.
