Weird stack inbalance, i'm surprised that works. %6 must be doing strange
things.

This seems incredibly slow. Since GS changes are controlled in 
the kernel why don't you just cache them in the per cpu area? 
The only case where user can reload it is using segment
selector changes, which can be also handled.
Also why do you need the guest gs value anyways? 
You could just use your own stack and let the guest
switch to its own.
