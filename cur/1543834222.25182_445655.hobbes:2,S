Not for the case being discussed in this thread, adapter-wide tags.
AFAICS, no file in include/scsi/* or drivers/scsi/* ever calls 
blk_queue_init_tags() with a non-NULL third arg.
The block tagging capability being discussed here is poorly validated 
due to overall underuse, and its never been used in SCSI AFAIK.
