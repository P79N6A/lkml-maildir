as i see it,  the reason that we are in this state today is that most of
the time instead of finding out the bugs for gcc-kernel we are given 
the reason below:
"the kernel has bugs of its own that we do not want anything introduced by
some buggy compiler". 
When will this be resolve? when the kernel has no more bugs? :(
Maybe we have to address the issue that gcc may someday be the standard
compiler of major distros that someday somebody might be able to say:
Hey I got this great compiler that compiles everything except the kernel 
:(
