Careful --- I found out to my cost that there are hidden recursions
here.  ext3 was bitten once by the fact that shrink_icache does a
quota drop, and that involves quota writeback if it was the last inode
on that particular quota struct.
shrinking the icache _usually_ involves no IO, but the quota case is
an exception which a lot of developers won't encounter during testing.
Cheers,
 Stephen
