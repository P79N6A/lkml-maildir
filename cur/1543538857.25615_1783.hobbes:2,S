Linus,
We already have versioning with modver to enforce version mismatches. 
This sounds like a control and freedom issue relative to being able to
efficiently make changes, which I agree is very important.  Novell
requires all driver writers to provide source code for driver
certification for the very reasons you cite.   I think this could be
made a policy issue since it relates more to the human element than any
technical arguments (other than the freedom to fixed busted and shitty
drivers, and BTW I agree completely with your position here).  
If folks were always required by licensing to post the code for binary
drivers they want you to consider for inclusion in Linux (the Linus
Torvalds driver certifiation program), I think this could be easily
dealt with.  Also, having an NLM-like "kernel only" interface much like
modutils provides that would allow you to segregate specific code pieces
for Linux kernel mode only would allow you the freedom to control these
issues since you could easily create a special binary interface just for
this stuff -- and you'd be the one making the rules the rest of us live
by.
