Currently, the CPU cache information is printed as a part of kernel bootup
messages and /proc/cpuinfo using cpuid(2). This patch is trying to use cpuid(4)
to print the messages in these places. I think this part of the patch is
required. Otherwise, we may end up printing 0 cache sizes on some CPUs.
It will also reduce the zero_cache_size_complaints on lkml :-).

Agreed. Exporting it in /sysfs is debatable. And some of the information like,
'Which CPUs are sharing what caches' may not be useful today. But,
with CPUs with HT and multiple cores and combinations of it, sharing different
caches, having this information will be useful inside the kernel as well. 
scheduler for example. We can setup some of the scheduler domain parameters 
based on whether L2 is shared or not. 
Also, we felt, exporting this information to userspace in a consistent way will
help userspace apps to do various things like binding to specific CPUs, using
the working set size based on cache size, etc, to optimize the performance. 
Again, this can be done in userspace as well. But, if kernel is already doing
it, it may be better to export it from the kernel space.
Thanks,
