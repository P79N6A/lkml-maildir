I'm wondering about the -m32 additions at the top of your patch.
Shouldn't the following at the top of arch/i386/Makefile already do the 
same?
HAS_BIARCH      := $(call cc-option-yn, -m32)
ifeq ($(HAS_BIARCH),y)
AS              := $(AS) --32
LD              := $(LD) -m elf_i386
CC              := $(CC) -m32
endif
