That would require a polymorphic macro __fls that adapts to 32bit and 64bit
arguments.  Not good C style.

AFAIK it only exists because some ancient sparc chips had incredibly
slow multipliers.

I bet most different approaches who might be slightly
faster for larger bit strings would make the one bit 
case slower.
