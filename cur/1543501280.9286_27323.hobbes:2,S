I've been playing with writing real-time guitar effects boxes, and I've
gotten the latency down to 11ms with stock linux.  Would changing the HZ
constant to 1024 help me reduce the latency (ie, does it cause a task to
get scheduled more often)?  Any other/better suggestions for decreasing
latency?  Thanks in advance.
