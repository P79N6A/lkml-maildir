Well if it doesn't happen again...

Oh it's reproduceable OK.  Just run
	make-teeny-files 7 7
against a few filesystems and watch the fun

Maybe you didn't cat /dev/sda2 for long enough?
You should end up with very little dcache and tons of icache.
Here's what I get:
  ext2_inode_cache:   420248KB   420256KB   99.99
       buffer_head:    40422KB    41648KB   97.5 
      dentry_cache:      667KB    10211KB    6.54
biovec-BIO_MAX_PAGES:      768KB      780KB   98.46
Massive internal fragmentation of the dcache there.  But it takes
a long time.
Generally, I feel that the proportional-shrink on slab is applying
too much pressure when there's not much slab and too little when
there's a lot.  If you have 400 megs of inodes I don't really think
they are likely to be used again soon.
Perhaps we need to multiply the slab cache scanning pressure by the
slab occupancy.  That's simple to do.
