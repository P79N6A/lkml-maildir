No dice.  Your program does not fix the problem.
If it were a hardware problem, I would expect the problem to occur
under 2.4.2 as well as 2.2.*, and I would be surprised that we can
consistently produce the behavior across our 64 node cluster.  But we
are keeping the possibility in mind.
Thanks for your suggestions.
Vic
