We have three mode for one controller - IDE/RAID/AHCI, we want sata_nv being load when user select the IDE mode in BIOS, load ahci driver if RAID/AHCI being selected, which will verify if our legacy mode work well and have additional option if there is any
bug for the ahci mode.

I don't understand why these are being moved?
If an interface can be driven via the AHCI driver, that is greatly 
preferred over the sata_nv driver.
