Subject: Hm.. [IPV4]: Be more verbose about invalid ICMPs sent to broadcast.

Hello,
I have just changed kernel on one of my servers from 2.4.21-rc6 into
2.4.22-pre3. One host in my network has some problems with so IP stack
implementation so I get used to read a lot of error messages from kernel
about invalid ICMP error.
I noticed that old, well known message:
Jul  9 18:27:46 mac kernel: 192.168.0.108 sent an invalid ICMP error to a broadcast.
suddenly chaned into:
Jul  9 18:36:28 mac kernel: 192.168.0.230 sent an invalid ICMP type 3, code 0 error to a broadcast:192.168.3.255 on eth0
As you can see the sender is different. If you look at the patch you can
see that NIPQUAD(skb->nh.iph->saddr) was chaned into NIPQUAD(iph->saddr):

                        goto out;
                }
        }
There is a line:
  iph = (struct iphdr *) skb->data;"
so AFAIK this line:
  ((struct iphdr*) skb->data)->saddr
is not the same like this one:
   skb->nh.iph->saddr
or am I wrong? Any other reason why this message has now different sender
address?
Best Regards,
