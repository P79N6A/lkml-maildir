>From my experience with mode 2:
you can't do _anything_, if the overcommitment range has been reached. Even 
running programms are crashing if they want to have some more memory. So, 
new processes cannot be started and old processes cannot run and are 
crashing as far as they want to have more memory. At last, there will be 
only one user-process on the machine running - the bad programm, eating up 
all the memory.
