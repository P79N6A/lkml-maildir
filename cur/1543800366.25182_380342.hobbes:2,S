Give memtest86+ a spin (
http://www.memtest.org/
) as well. memtest86 is
good, but I've found in the past that memtest86+ sometimes finds
errors that memtest86 does not, so giving both a sin fo an extended
period of time is usually a good idea.
Also, make sure you enable all the tests of both tools.
