I understand that if FMODE_WRITE|FMODE_EXEC opens must fail, then
FMODE_EXEC is a poor fit for DENY_WRITE.
What I don't understand is the source of the requirement that
FMODE_WRITE|FMODE_EXEC opens be disallowed.
The only users of FMODE_EXEC introduced by Oleg's patch use a hardcoded
FMODE_READ|FMODE_EXEC, so it doesn't seem to impose any constraints on
the meaning of FMODE_WRITE|FMODE_EXEC.
