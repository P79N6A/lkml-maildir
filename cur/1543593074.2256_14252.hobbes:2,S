Hello
I am writing a profiling tool for a project I am working on,
and I need to know how to map addresses of calling functions
to the appropriate human-readable name.  Is there a data structure
in the kernel that I can access to achieve this?  Or can I reference
a load map (in days gone by, I used to refer to this as a link-edit
map) given the load address of the program?  Where can I find the
load address of the program?
Thanks
Tom Collins
