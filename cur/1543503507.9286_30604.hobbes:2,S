Subject: [2.3.11=pre6]: No OOPS, but mount segfaults remounting "/"?

I have UP PPro.  2.3.11-pre6 works great... seems significantly smoother
than pre5 somehow.  However, when 'mount -n -o remount,rw /' is called on
bootup, the command succeeds, but segfaults.
If I run this command AFTER '/' is already mounted read-write, then no
segfault occurs.
