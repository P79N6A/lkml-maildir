Rather than mixing problem and solution, let me just define the two 
problems in this thread:
1) There is no clear, CONSISTENT point where "bugfixes only" begins. 
Right now, it could be -rc2, -rc3, -rc4... who knows.
We need to send a clear signal to users "this is when you can really 
start hammering it."  A signal that does not change from release to 
release.  A signal that does not require intimate knowledge of the 
kernel devel process.
This is a key reason why we don't get more pre-release testing.
2) After 2.6.11 release is out, there is no established process for "oh 
shit, 2.6.11 users will really want that fixed."
--------------------
Linus's even/odd proposal is an example of a solution for problem #2, as 
is my 2.6.X.Y proposal.
The 2.4.x series -pre/-rc is an example of a solution for problem #1.
