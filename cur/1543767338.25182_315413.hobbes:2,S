Hi List!
I am relative sure that I found an annoing bug in the pdc202xx_old driver.  
The problems are officially solved, but there are still those DMA-problems  
with the pdc20262 and drives >40 gb.
Are you aware of that? I am at will to test anything you suggest...
Please CC me to any responses.
Best wishes,
Macskasi Csaba
