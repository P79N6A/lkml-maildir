This is policy, and policy should be implemented in userland. Have your
driver implement a device node that presents the value when userland
reads it. Imlement a simple userland program that read()s the device
and writes it to whatever file you like. The advantage of this approach
is that userland can decide *where* to write it: on a hard disk, send
it over a network, etc. etc.
