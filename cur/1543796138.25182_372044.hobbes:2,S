Hmm... These times of day don't coincide with any actual commits....
Anyhow, this was the day Hartmut added tda8275a support.  It broke many 
things, which we thought that we had eventually fixed.  Maybe there are 
still a few bugs as a result of this?
This is enough for me to put together a test patch for you, but I cant 
do it right now..... I'll try to email you an experimental patch tonight 
or tomorrow that will remove tda8275a support, just to confirm that this 
is in fact the problem.
If it turns out that I'm right, then we'll have to figure out a way to 
fix it, since reverting Hartmut's patch is NOT an option.
Thanks for the testing!
