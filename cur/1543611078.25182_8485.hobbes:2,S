I've running 2.4.16 with this VM patch combined with your
2.4.15-pre7-low-latency patch from www.zip.com.au.  (it applied with a
little fuzz, no rejects). Is this a combination that you would feel
comfortable with?
So far it hasn't blown up on me, and in fact seems very quick and
responsive.  
Unless I hear a "No, don't do that!", I'm going to push this kernel into
testing for our video applications...
Thanks!
