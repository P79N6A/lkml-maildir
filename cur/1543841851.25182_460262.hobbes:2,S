hello
I have now tested the patch found here:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/9/3/148
And that patchs works fine, I can now boot the system.
I have also tested this patch pci-quirk_via_irq-behaviour-change.patch
and it works fine as well, I can boot the system again.
It is kernel version 2.6.17.11 that I have tested the patches on.
So any of those two patches makes my system boot again.
Johnny
