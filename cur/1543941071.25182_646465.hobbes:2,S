In recent kernels, I had a hard hang in -git6 on my Fedora8-based
 Dell D610 (x86, UP) - and since at least -git4 I can't shutdown my
 Oracle 11.1 instance, with the VKTM thread remaining in R state,
 while taking up no CPU at all:
[root@sandman ~]# ps ax | grep vktm
 3211 ?        Rs     0:00 ora_vktm_t111
 additionally, VKTM is
 - non-straceable (strace hangs)
 - non-gdb'able (gdb hangs)
 - non-pstack'able (pstack returns empty)
 - non-killable (kill -9 doesn't kill it)
echo'ing 't' in /proc/sysrq-trigger, I have (2.6.24-git8):

Once I'm done with a largish FTP I'll try and find out where
 this exactly began.
