Stefan,
Did earlier versions of 2.6 (or 2.5) work?
Does booting 2.6.0-test4 with acpi=off make any difference?
Curious that vanilla 2.4.x has an issue with kbd interrupts on this box, but SuSE 8.2 does not.  Apparently SuSE 8.2 has a fix or workaround for this box that isn't in the baseline -- anybody know what it is?
Thanks,
-Len
