Hello....
I've got an HP NetServer LHr3 running v2.2.11.  It's got 3 PCI busses in it
with a Symbios/NCR 53c895 on-board, an HP NetRaid/AMI MegaRaid adapter, and
an Adaptec AHA-2944UW.  The AHA-2944UW is supposed to be attached to an
external storage device, but the host panics at boot when it's attached.
I've tried changing the reverse_scan to 1 in aic7xxx.c and recompiling, but
to no avail.  I've tried the AMI as static, but the host won't boot.  I've
tried the NCR both as  modules and static, but if I have the Adaptec
attached to the storage, the ohst panics either way.
I've kept the aic7xxx as a module in the hopes that it would come up after
the ncr53c8xx when it is static, but it still loads before the NCR.  
How do I change this so I can use the Adaptec to attach to the external
storage and still boot my system without making it panic?
Any suggestions are greatly appreciated.
Thanks.
Heather
