<DIV><FONT color=#000000 size=2>Somebody took the liberty of subscribing me to 
the linux kernel against my will and without my knowledge. I don't want to be 
subscribed to it. I don't even have linux or know anything significant about it. 
I would appreciate it dearly if you would help me unsubscribe from linux kernel. 
I would be happy to give you any info you need to aid you in helping me. Thank 
you. In advance, my name is Joshua Harris, my email is <A

I cant' imagine anything else you would need to know; Please unsubscribe me from 
linux kernel; thank you.</FONT></DIV></BODY></HTML>
