Kernel: 2.5.58 + bitkeeper patches + a patch by Patrick Mochel to fix an 
initrd oops: 
http://www.uwsg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0301.1/2364.html
I hit the following BUG twice while working with GNU parted.
The first time I tried to remove (rm) a partition and create a smaller one in 
its place (mkpart). The second time I tried to remove a partition and create 
a larger one in its place. Both times the partitions were created with the 
proper size, but parted crashed with a segmentation fault.
Here's the important parts of the BUG:
parted: OOPS	 devfs.put: Poisoned put
...
Kernel BUG at fs/devfs/base.c: 930!
