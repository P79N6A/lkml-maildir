That makes sense.
Can we make the following two conclusions?
1. In a single machine, inode+dev ID+i_generation can uniquely identify a file
2. Given a stored file handle and an inode object received from the
server,  an NFS client can safely determine whether this inode
corresponds to the file handle by checking the inode+dev+i_generation.
Thanks,
