This is completely wrong.
Andrew, I don't know what happened.  But if you go back and compare my
original patch to the
pm-make-wakeup-flags-available-whenever-config_pm-is-set patch you
actually applied, you'll see that you managed to leave out a hunk.  
Possibly because of a conflict with one of Rafael's patches affecting 
the same area of code.
Here's a URL for that patch as rebased by Rafael:
	
http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=120528034413861&w=2
The very first hunk in that patch makes the should_wakeup flag
available always, not just when CONFIG_PM_SLEEP is set.  If you go back
and import it with that first hunk intact then there should be no need 
for this "fix" patch.
(In order to do this, you'll first have to revert
pm-convert-wakeup-flag-accessors-to-inline-functions.patch and then
re-apply it afterward, because it depends on this one.)
