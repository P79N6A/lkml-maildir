Ahha!  So there is in fact already an interface!  I just hadn't realized it was
hiding as a syscall (and linux/module.h header seems to neglect mentioning it).
Very cool.  Wish I'd known about that before I wasted yesterday evening writing
devmodules.  Oh well.
Ok, devmodules is now history.  The rest of the patch
still stands (unless somebody can point out better way to 
do the other stuff in there).  Thx for your help,
 -Erik
