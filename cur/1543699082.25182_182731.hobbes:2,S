Hello,
I was trying to recomile my kernel and when configuring it I got the next
message:
Quote:
********
Menuconfig has encountered a possible error in one of the kernel's
configuration files and is unable to continue.  Here is the error
report:
 Q> scripts/Menuconfig: line 832: MCmenu78: command not found
Please report this to the maintainer <mec@shout.net>.  You may also
send a problem report to <linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org>.
Please indicate the kernel version you are trying to configure and
which menu you were trying to enter when this error occurred.
make: *** [menuconfig] Error 1
********
End quote.
Therefore, I'm reporting you that the kernel version is: linux-2.4.22-10mdk
The "uname -a" command returns:
"Linux core.ondems.com 2.4.22-10mdk #1 Thu Sep 18 12:30:58 CEST 2003 i686
unknown unknown GNU/Linux"
The menu I was trying to get into (when this error appeared) was the "Advanced
Linux Sound Architecture".
If it helps, before I was trying to enter into that submenu I removed the
support for *all* the sound cards in the "Sound" menu.
Hoping that it helps,
Best regards
Aurelian
