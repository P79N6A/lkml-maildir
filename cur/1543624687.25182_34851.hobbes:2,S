Port ED is fine for a BIOS, which (by definition) knows what the
motherboard devices are, and thus knows that ED cannot be used by
anything.
But it _is_ an unused port, and that's exactly the kind of thing that
might be used sometime in the future. Remember the port 22/23 brouhaha
with Cyrix using it for their stuff, and later Intel getting into the fray
too?
So the fact that ED works doesn't mean that _stays_ working.
The fact that 80 is the post code register means that it is fairly likely 
to _stay_ that way, without any ugly surprises.
Now, if there is something _else_ than just the fact that it is unused
that makes ED a good choice in the future too, that might be worth looking
into (like NT using it for the same purpose as Linux does port 80),
