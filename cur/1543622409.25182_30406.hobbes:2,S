It would be nice if there was a 'deleted' dir per mount point, as that would
keep similar speeds as rm.  Also, 'deleted' would probably have to be marked
writable, but not readable and would need a suid binary to read that dir and
limit the output to only list files owned by the calling uid.  But that's a
bit too offtopic for this list...
