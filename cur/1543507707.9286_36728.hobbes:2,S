After looking through the strace (and my original problem) - I see that
the read which is giving me trouble is in read_extended().  Naturally
since the change in 2.2, the entry in the main partition table points to
a sector somewhere which isn't the one containing the extended
partition - and may even be beyond the end of the disk as the previous
extended partition was in the 8-9 gig area.
However, after dd-ing /dev/zero over the first sector (the partition
table), the same error (from ll_rw_block) still occurs.  Viewing the
strace output (included below) makes it appear as though the HDIO_GETGEO
ioctl() call is the one that produces the printk(), as it appears before
the first output from fdisk on the console.  (4 lines after the open()
on /dev/sda, so it must be in there somewhere.)  This appears to solve
my immediate problem, as fdisk no longer dies with the failed read.
