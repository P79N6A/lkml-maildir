The roaring-penguin solution can use the in-kernel module, if
requested.
Mr. Ostrowski isn't maintaining his patch anymore, it seems.
The pppd got the plugin-architecture, as requested but didn't
adapt the pppoe module from Mr. Ostrowksi.
Maybe he himself or the PPP maintainer could elaborate, if they
read the message.
