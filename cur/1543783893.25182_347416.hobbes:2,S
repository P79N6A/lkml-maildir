I'm not sure you're receiving my mails, but I'll give it a try anyway.
It would also seem that my MTA is choking on your MX entries. I'll look
into that once I get home.
CONFIG_PM is missing because of consistency with i8259.c, on which the
code is based. So if it is desired I suppose a patch for them both would
be in order.
