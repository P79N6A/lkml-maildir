x86: revised - use explicit timing delay for pit accesses
pit accesses in i8253.c and pcspkr driver use outb_p for timing.
Fix them to use explicit timing delay for access to PIT,
rather than inb_p/outb_p calls, which use insufficiently explicit
delays (defaulting to port 80 writes) that can cause freeze problems
on some machines, such as Quanta moterboard  machines using ENE EC's.
Since the pcspkr driver accesses PIT registers directly, it needs
the symbol outb_pit exported, so it can be built as a module.
Explicit timing delay is only needed in pcspkr for accesses to the 8253 PIT.
Fix pcspkr driver to use the new outb_pic call properly, use
named PIC port values rather than hex constants, and drop its use of
inb_p and outb_p in accessing port 61h where it has never been needed.
