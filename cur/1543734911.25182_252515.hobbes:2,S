I thought it has been ironed out here.
Note that the difference arises only whether softirq-preempt and
hardirq-preempt are enabled or not.
- with softirq-preempt=0 and hardirq-preempt=0, jackd realtime runs
perfectly, as advertised (jackd -R -p 128 -n 2), and sounds good too ;)
- with softirq-preempt=1 and hardirq-preempt=1, the XRUN storm is terribly
annoying. And sound is obviously a crackling festival.
Remember, that all this is on same hardware, same smp kernel configuration
(CONFIG_SCHED_SMT is not set), same everything else (SuSE 9.1, NPTL 0.61,
jack-0.98.11cvs).
I hope the latency-traces show something useful. Til then...
Take care.
