Marc,
Everything you say betrays the fact that the Free Software mentality is 
not a consideration in your thinking.  You clearly think it is, but it 
is clearly not.  This argument you're speaking one language, and you're 
speaking another.  Before you can get along with us, you have to learn 
to think like us.
Until you grok the Free Software mentality, you will continue to get flamed.
