Now I've tried -22 in mode=4 and its the same hard lockup after this 
line is printed to the screen:
"Checking to see if this processor honours the WP bit even in the 
supervisor mode...  OK"
reset button to recover. -22 in mode=3, no hardirq's now building 
while running -19.
-22, mode=3 no hardirq's is running, but it took kmail a couple of 
minutes to fully init its screen, with a spamd child eating 99% of 
the cpu.  The logs are silent after "loading the r200 code" from 
startx.  But, it seems to be ok now.  More data when available.
