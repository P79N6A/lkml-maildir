The saga continues. It happened again this morning even with the
patch:
irq 193: nobody cared (try booting with the "irqpoll" option)

The drives on this controller went offline.
This is my interrupts table:

lspci -v shows this for the controller. No other device (at least
pci device) is using IRQ 193.
0000:01:03.0 0106: Pacific Digital Corp: Unknown device 2068 (rev 01)
        Subsystem: Pacific Digital Corp: Unknown device 2068
        Flags: bus master, 66MHz, medium devsel, latency 64, IRQ 193
        I/O ports at eff0 [size=8]
        I/O ports at efe0 [size=8]
        I/O ports at efa8 [size=8]
        I/O ports at efa0 [size=8]
        Memory at febf0000 (64-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=64K]
        Expansion ROM at febe0000 [disabled] [size=64K]
        Capabilities: <available only to root>
Any other ideas I can try to look for? Is there any other type
of device that may be using the IRQ but not listed with the above
commands?
Thanks,
Alberto
