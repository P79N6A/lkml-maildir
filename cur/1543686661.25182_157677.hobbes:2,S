NFORCE2: chipset revision 162
A quick google for "NFORCE2: chipset revision" reveals no chipset revision 
dmesg except 162. It seems likely most manufactures are using the same 
revision.
I use APIC and ACPI on my EPoX 8RDA+, and I've never had any IO problems. So 
it seems unlikely that it is tied to a chipset revision.

I have not noticed any such APIC issues.

Sounds suspiciously like software to me.
