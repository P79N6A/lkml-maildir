I used the on-board serial port as a known working control (after 
getting it to work with the other onboard serial port) to try and 
connect over to one of the Syba card ports (using Cutecom & getty).  The 
lines light up, but there's nothing getting sent from the 8-port as far 
as I can see.  The onboard port works as I'd expect, the Syba (running 
getty identically from inittab) doesn't.
