Compiler used? memcmp() used? Machine?
Note that the latest egcs snapshots by default enable optimizations based
on the assumption that only pointers to the same type can create aliases
(this according to ANSI C). The in-kernel mem* functions break this
assumption big time, probably other implementations do so too...
Try -fno-strict-aliasing
