I have a Dell Inspiron 3700 running Redhat 7.2 with the latest updates,
and I just upgraded to kernel 2.4.18. On random intervals, usually within
about 10 minutes of usage, it hangs completely solid.
Enabling sysrq, recompiling 2.4.18 with kdb, and going to tinker with APIC
tomorrow. Results, kernel .config, lspci -v, and so forth will be posted
when I'm more awake.
Anyway, the short form: anyone else have any problems, or have I gone
crazy again?
