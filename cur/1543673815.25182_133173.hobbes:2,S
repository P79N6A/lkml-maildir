Hello,
Sorry for the late answer.
Thanks for the tcpdump thing. I've tried it and I saw nothing on the link.
So I verified that the parallel port was correctly configured and ... it 
was (I was able to print things
on my printer).
No error/warning messages about plip.
So, I returned back to my computer shop and looked at what precisely had 
I bought:
A SERIAL null-modem ?
I thought null-modem was only dedicated to parallel port ?
So, I bought a PARALLEL null-modem and now it works fine (with kernel 
2.4.19).
Your sincerely,
Yann COLLETTE
