	Obviously Dan didn't bother to read my e-mail. The problem is
definitely not with kbuild. The problem is with the
__define_initcall() levels.

	The problem is *not* the networking initialisation (I wish
people were *reading* my e-mails). The basic networking is initialised
early enough. The various networking stacks could be initialised
earlier, but I don't depend on them. Note that there might be a reason
to initialise networking after the file system, so to do that we might
need to insert a level between fs_initcall() and device_initcall().
	The problem is with the initialisation of the random
generator. It needs to be done earlier.
