I doubt it, these ioctls are generally frowned on and noone touches
them these days - eg. from fs.h...
#define BMAP_IOCTL 1            /* obsolete - kept for compatibility */
#define FIBMAP     _IO(0x00,1)  /* bmap access */
#define FIGETBSZ   _IO(0x00,2)  /* get the block size used for bmap */

There's an XFS-specific way if youre using XFS, and other filesystems
may have their own custom way of providing that information, I'm not
sure.  For XFS, the xfs_bmap(8) command uses XFS_IOC_GETBMAP to get
an inode's extent layout, and that works for all file types.
cheers.
