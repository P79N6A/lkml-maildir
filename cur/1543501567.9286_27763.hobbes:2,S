(Western Digital Caviar AC420400, 20 GB UDMA drive)
Should not in ide-proc.c around line 715 the sprintf parameters %hi be
replaced by %hu so that the kernel returns the proper "39560" cylinder
count? Looking at ide.h, the cyl is unsigned short anyways so %hi is
actually really wrong (Just wondering why gcc doesn't warn although
-Wall is set). 
Find the patch against 2.2.10 attached. (Also works for 2.3.8 with 9
line offset, untested since 2.3.8 doesn't compile for me.) 
Below the hdparm -i stuff for that drive:
| Model=WDC AC420400D, FwRev=J58OA30K, SerialNo=WD-WT662
| Config={ HardSect NotMFM HdSw>15uSec Fixed DTR>10Mbs }
> RawCHS=39560/16/63, TrkSize=0, SectSize=0, ECCbytes=34
| BuffType=3(DualPortCache), BuffSize=1966kB, MaxMultSect=16, MultSect=off
| DblWordIO=no, maxPIO=2(fast), DMA=yes, maxDMA=2(fast)
| CurCHS=2482/255/63, CurSects=39876480, LBA=yes, LBAsects=39876480
| tDMA={min:120,rec:120}, DMA modes: mword0 mword1 mword2 
| IORDY=on/off, tPIO={min:240,w/IORDY:120}, PIO modes: mode3 mode4 
BTW: What will happen for IDE drives that are larger than 32256 MB (31.5 GB
== 33.8 marketing GB)? That's the limit for 65535/16/63 geometry.  
Find the patch attached as MIME text.
