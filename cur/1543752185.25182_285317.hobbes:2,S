You might see if you can swap positions in the case first, then I guess 
you would have nothing to try but actually flipping master with slave 
(and contents as well, good fun).
Just wondering, where is your swap? Your Journal? Do you have a small 
fast drive you could use for swap and external journal? I checked all 
the machines which have a similar configuration, and I don't see any 
pattern, although all the machines with really high i/o load are using SCSI.
