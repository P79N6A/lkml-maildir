On my part, its mostly a matter of not crashing the kernel when someone
tries to force modprobe of a proprietary module (where the checksums
doesn't match) on a kernel that supports the markers. Not doing so
causes the markers to try to find the marker-specific information in
struct module which doesn't exist and OOPSes.
Christoph's point of view is rather more drastic than mine : it's not
interesting for the kernel community to help proprietary modules writers,
so it's a good idea not to give them marker support. (I CC'ed him so he
can clarify his position).
