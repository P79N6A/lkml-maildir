You want a huge white list or what? And you volunteer to maintain
it?
My current thinking is to just wait for Vista certified machines
and then use DMI year >= 2007 or so to enable it. 
Most likely your secret card won't ship before that anyways and 
maybe it can be even somehow used without MCFG. And if it can't
it is out of luck right now. Send blame to the BIOS writers
who are unable to get the MCFG tables right.
I don't think white list is the right answer though. If it
was only a small list of machines with broken BIOS it would
be possible to black list, but Intel pretty much sabotated that 
by releasing a broken reference BIOS that is used in lots of different
boards. 
I considered PCI ID checking for those chipsets instead of
SMBIOS checking, but that has other problems too.
