Looking at it the current check is indeed incorrect.
Primarily because it is a check on open and not a check
on access.  We can open the directory anytime so if
this is a serious permission we need to check on access.
Further when it is ourselves we always have access to that
information directly, and /proc is just a convenience.  So
we should not be denying ourselves.
Other processes we do need to deny if we aren't dumpable because
they don't have another way to get that information.
Speaking of things why does the *at() emulation need to touch
/proc/self/fd/*?  I may be completely dense but if the practical
justification for allowing access to /proc/self/fd/ is that we
already have access then we shouldn't need /proc/self/fd.
I suspect this a matter of convenience where you are prepending
/proc/self/fd/xxx/ to the path before you open it instead of calling
fchdir openat() and the doing fchdir back.  Have I properly guessed
how the *at() emulation works?
