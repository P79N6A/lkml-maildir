I plan to try and push LVM2 to Marcelo after the next release. Whether
he will take it I don't know. Obviously its good to have the ability to
move back nicely to older kernels.

Throwing away a big piece of code really sucks. I think however its the
right path - adding those things EVMS needs kernel side into a cleaner
framework and the tools is better than two systems in one kernel. I
appreciate you guys doing what looks to be the right thing for the Linux
project overall even when it must be a bitter disappointment.
