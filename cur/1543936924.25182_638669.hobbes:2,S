Something like the loop above is not going to go in for sure.  Once we
get rid of the sb->s_files we can put the list_head in struct file to
new use eventually if we don't want to get rid of it.  E.g. and
per-inode list would be much better than the per-superblock one and
would regularize what the tty driver is doing.
But I'm not too interesting in hashing out these details currently,
my primary concern is to get the per-mount r/o plus fallout like the
correct remount r/o and file_list_lock removal in and stable first.
