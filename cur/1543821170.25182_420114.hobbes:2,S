Subject: [PATCH 0/7] Uml fixes for 2.6.17
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/4/30/63

This series fixes one "regression" in the 2.6.17 cycle (the mismerge of a
patch broke some code), makes UML compile & run with GCC hardened and fixes
some regressions of the compile infrastructure - special CFLAGS settings for
some files, needed in some configurations (say with profiling enabled) weren't
applied due to bad interactions with Kbuild. Finally, we make UML compatible
with Debian settings for uml_utilities (which conform to the FHS).
From stg series:
+ uml-diagnose-64-bit-broken-padding    | uml: fix patch mismerge
+ uml-PATH-for-uml_net.patch            | uml: search from uml_net in a more
	reasonable PATH
+ uml-copy_user-inatomic-v2.patch       | uml: make copy_*_user atomic
+ uml-makefile-nicer                    | uml: use Kbuild tracking for all
	files and fix compilation output
+ uml-compile-nopic-clone-stub          | uml: fix compilation and execution
	with hardened GCC
+ uml-fix-unprofile-kbuild-interaction  | uml: cleanup unprofile expression
	and build infrastructure
+ uml-export-stack-protector-symbols    | uml: export symbols added by GCC
	hardened

Inform me of my mistakes, so I can keep imitating Homer Simpson's "Doh!".
