Yes. I've got another patch to include a non-unrolled version of SHA
in cryptolib but that depends on some config magic I haven't thought
out. Another thing I failed to mention at 3am is that most of the
speed increase actually comes from the following patch which wasn't in
baseline and isn't cryptoapi-specific. So I expect the cryptoapi
version is about 30% faster once you amortize the initialization
stuff.

Remove folding step and double throughput.
If there was a recognizable output pattern, simply folding would make
things worse. To see why, assume bits x and y are correlated, but are
othewise random. Then x^y has a bias toward zero, meaning less entropy
than just x alone.
Best case, this is the moral equivalent of running every bit through
SHA four times rather than twice. Twice should be more than enough.

They're probably equal on modern machines. The random code is from 486 days.

Preventing data leakage is the intent, though I'm not sure its worth
the trouble. If your attacker can leverage this sort of data leakage,
you probably have more important stuff to worry about.
