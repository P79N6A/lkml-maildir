FWIW, I've just tried loop-AES with 2.4.24, after using cryptoapi for a
number of years. My machine froze dead in the midst of copying 2.8GB of
data onto my file-backed reiserfs encrypted loopback mount.
Since the system didn't ever freeze on me before and since I've had zero
problems with cryptoapi, I attribute the freeze to loop-AES.
Yes, I know this isn't a good bugreport...
