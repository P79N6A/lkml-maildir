Dear diary, on Sun, Apr 10, 2005 at 11:39:02PM CEST, I got a letter
where Linus Torvalds <torvalds@osdl.org> told me that...

That's great, just when I finally managed to properly fix the xargs
boundary case in gitdiff-do (without throwing away the NUL-termination).
You know how to please people! ;-)
(Not that I'd have *anything* against the change. The logic is simpler
and you'll be actually able to work with diff-tree a little sanely.)
BTW, it is quite handy to have the entry type in the listing (guessing
that from mode in the script just doesn't feel right and doing explicit
cat-file kills the performance). I would also really prefer the fields
separated by tabs. It looks nicer on the screen (aligned, e.g. modes and
type are varsized), and is also easier to parse (cut defaults to tabs as
delimiters, for example).

...oh, I probably forgot to ask - why did you choose -R instead of -r?
It looks rather alien to me; if it starts by 'diff', my hand writes -r
without thinking.

Ok, this looks reasonable. (Provided that I DWYM regarding the joins.)

I will definitively try "git merge", but maybe not this night anymore
(it's already 1:32 here now).

98% of the time I am right. Why worry about the other 3%.
