Actually you can legally (at least/even with author's rights hereover).
But it will be very hard to convince a judge and/or lawyers that you
didn't actually copy it.
And the question is moot anyways since it is extremely unlikely you end
up with the same implementation for the same problem (unless the problem
is small/simple/trivial enough like "binary search in a sorted array on
int's").
