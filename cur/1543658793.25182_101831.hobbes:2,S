Yes.  Richard withdrew the one about allocation (we used a special
per-arch allocator, he missed it), the one about common section
ordering was fixed by RTH noticing we use -fno-common, so all that
logic was dropped anyway, and his section ordering query was fixed by
his section ordering patch (which changed the arch interface
slightly).

It's certainly simpler.  My ia64 current implementation is around 500
lines, vs 225 lines for the shared version.
But I'm not prepared to shaft an arch over it this late in the cycle,
and the current scheme puts less pressure on toolchains (several other
binutils "issues" were discovered in implementing
modules-as-shared-objects).
Hope that clarifies,
Rusty.
