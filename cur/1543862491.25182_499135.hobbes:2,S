Why? Could you explain?

Because CPU_DEAD/CPU_UP_CANCELED doesn't wait for cwq->thread to exit.
cpu_populated_map never shrinks, it only grows on CPU_UP_PREPARE.
We can change this, but it needs some more code, and I am not sure
we need it. Note that a "false" bit in cpu_populated_map only means
that flush_work/flush_workqueue/destroy_workqueu will do lock/unlock
of cwq->lock, nothing more.

The whole purpose of this change to avoid this!

With this change workqueue_mutex is only taken to protect workqueues
list, why should we hold it for (say) CPU_UP_PREPARE->CPU_ONLINE path?

I think this is not needed.

This change ir not strictly necessary but imho make the code better and
shrinks .text by 379 bytes.
But I believe that freezer will change nothing for workqueue. We still
need take_over_work(), and hacks like migrate_sequence. And no, CPU_DEAD
can't just thaw cwq->thread which was bound to the dead CPU to complete
kthread_stop(), we should thaw all processes.
