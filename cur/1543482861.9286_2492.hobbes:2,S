Mike,
You have the ALI V chipset..........
Recompile and do not enable 'CONFIG_IDEDMA_AUTO' this option.
For drives hda and hdb, ide0=dma through your lilo.conf append line.
ide-scsi with EIDE-CDRW freak with DMA.  You get buffer under runs,
and lots of shiney skeet targets...........
This was explained a long time ago, but never documented correctly.
Jens, can you make a note somewhere for me, thanks.
