Just as a warning: This is your own legal opinion/advice, one which is
apparently not shared with many other kernel developers, including me.
For example see Greg's OLS keynote:
http://www.kroah.com/log/2006/07/23/#ols_2006_keynote
or some of Linus' emails on this topic:
http://cvs.fedora.redhat.com/viewcvs/
*checkout*/rpms/kernel/devel/COPYING.modules?rev=1.5
I hope you have talked to a lawyer about your advice, but I sort of
doubt it since your answer doesn't sound like something a lawyer will
tell you (it sure doesn't match what the various lawyers I talked to
told me, not at all)
Anyway the best advice for anyone who asks such a question is to go talk
to a lawyer, and probably he should take a few of those links printed
out with him just to alert the lawyer about the controversial nature of
things.
