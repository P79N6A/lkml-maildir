A number of other people are seeing the same thing and Tejun is putting in
a blacklist of machines which cannot use libata+acpi.  That patch is not
yet in any git tree which I pull.
AFACIT the machines kepe working OK - there's just some nasty dmesg spew.
If any machines _are_ breaking then this could cause real problems and I'd
prefer that we either go for a whitelist or arrange to detect the condition
and fall back to non-acpi ata.
