FWIW, I'm seeing the same message after which any attempt to play any sound 
simply hangs (with an additional instance of the message). Unloading all 
sound-related modules and reloaded them doesn't help and I end up rebooting 
to clear the problem. I'm only running into this about once per week so it's 
more of a nuisance than anything else.
