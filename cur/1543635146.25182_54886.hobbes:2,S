Minicom doesn't care which port you use. It might be that some
people have saved configs of 6 years old that still contain
references to a cua device, but that's a problem any serial
program has.
From the manpage of any recent minicom:
       Serial port setup
          *A - Serial device
               /dev/tty1   or   /dev/ttyS1   for   most   people.
               /dev/cua<n> is still possible under linux, but not
               recommended  any  more  because  these devices are
               obsolete and many  newly  installed  systems  with
               kernel  2.2.x  don't  have them.  Use /dev/ttyS<n>
               instead.
Mike.
