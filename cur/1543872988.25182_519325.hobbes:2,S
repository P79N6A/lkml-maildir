If Con actually implements SCHED_IDLEPRIO in RSDL, life is good even
in that case.

Exactly. Driving us again toward the fact that different workloads
might benefit from different schedulers (eg: RSDL is cool for server
loads, previous staircase did an excellent job on desktop, etc) and
thus that having a choice of schedulers might be something that would
satisfy (some) people...

It certainly is. "Negative" feedback can be a good thing too, as it
helps improving it anyway. It's nonetheless true that it's practically
impossible to satisfy 100% of use case with a single design, so
choices will have to be made.
