No, it has indeed been possible to build scsi as a module for a long
time and in that case, scsi_ioctl becomes part of that module. The same 
problem also exists for any user of register_ioctl32_conversion(), e.g.
ieee1394.

Right, it appears to be a physical address, which therefore would require
a new mapping macro to be really correct. If this were used on s390, that
macro would be the same as compat_ptr(), the other architectures probably 
need a simple cast (again, like compat_ptr()). Either of 1. new macro, 2.
compat_ptr() or 3. the existing code works correctly here, so just do
whichever you prefer. Maybe somebody else has a strong opinion on it.
