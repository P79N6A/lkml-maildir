Oooooopppsss...sorry,  s/PARPORT/PARIDE/  8-Z
Typo on my part when entering the email. However, the following is the
relevant section of init/main.c relating to these options...
===8<=== CUT ===>8===
#ifdef CONFIG_PARIDE_PD
	{ "pd.", pd_setup },
#endif
#ifdef CONFIG_PARIDE_PCD
	{ "pcd.", pcd_setup },
#endif
#ifdef CONFIG_PARIDE_PF
	{ "pf.", pf_setup },
#endif
#ifdef CONFIG_PARIDE_PT
        { "pt.", pt_setup },
#endif
#ifdef CONFIG_PARIDE_PG
        { "pg.", pg_setup },
#endif
===8<=== CUT ===>8===
As you can see, all of the above options are listed as being a series
of letters terminated by a dot, nothing else being shown as following
the dot in any of those cases.
 >>+    LPT 		Printer support is enabled.
 >>+    parport=	[HW,LP]
 >>+    plip=		[LP,NET] Parallel port network link.
 >>+    lp= 		[LPT] Parallel Printer.
 > If `LP' and `LPT' are supposed to be the same, this is bogus.
They were all meant to be LPT rather than LP. Also, I'm not quite sure
what you mean by "this is bogus", so if you could explain, it would be
appreciated.
Here's the patch to correct those errors you identified that I
understood.
