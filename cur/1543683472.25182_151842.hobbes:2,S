I already posted a patch that read:
+         Ext3 is a journaling version of the Second extended fs
+         (or just ext2fs), the de facto standard Linux filesystem
+         (method to organize files on a storage device) for block
+         devices such as hard disk partitions.
I can resend with your version, though we have an almost perfect match
as far as the first clause goes. :)
