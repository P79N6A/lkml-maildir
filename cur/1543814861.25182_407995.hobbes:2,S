True, someone might be doing something like that, but consider this as well;
an app promts the user to enter a value and passes it on, expecting to
get EINVAL back if the value is wrong and has code in place to handle
that (like, say, prompt the user for a different value).
That app is not buggy, but it will not work correctly because *we* are buggy.
IMO we should cater to the correctly written app and prevent it from
breaking unexpectedly rather than continue to keep the buggy one
working.
