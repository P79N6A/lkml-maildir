Hi,
I think that the speed of the kernel boot is not the main speed problem.
You may want to try minit written by Fefe. You can download it and test.
I have not tried it myself but I heave seen Fefe's laptop on 18c3 and it
booted really impresive fast.
cheers Piotr

Certainly if something like grub or lilo can figure out how to access a file on the drive the kernel could check for a 'defaults' file or something to get the default irq's, hardware, interrupts, etc from.  Then the kernel could probe these first and if the probe fails proble elsewhere for the device.
