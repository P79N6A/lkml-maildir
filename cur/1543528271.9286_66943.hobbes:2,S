I would like to create a separate process (given the filename of the binary), WITHIN A SYSTEM CALL.   The new process created should not affect the current running process in whose context the system call is executing.
I tried with the do_fork function followed by the do_execve, but making the exec happen on behalf of the process just created would mean forcing a context switch to that process before the exec, which seems quite problematic.  Can anybody propose a solution ?
Thanks in advance,
