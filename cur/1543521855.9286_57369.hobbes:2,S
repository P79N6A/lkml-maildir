Hi,
If you look back a little in the archives, you'll find Ingo's last
comments wrt raid status.  I don't have the message handy, but he
said the word `fundamental' in a context which I interpreted to mean
that it needs some serious updating.  [I think he was refering to
raid-5 then, because raid-0 and raid-1 are still rrrock solid here
at 2.3.39 with no logic changed (why it still works:) since 2.1.131.]
