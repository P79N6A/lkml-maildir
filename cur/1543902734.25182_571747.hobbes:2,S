Subject: does CONFIG_UNUSED_SYMBOLS have any value anymore?

  just curious -- under kernel hacking, there is the option
UNUSED_SYMBOLS to "Enable unused/obsolete exported symbols" using
EXPORT_UNUSED_SYMBOL[_GPL].  reads the help text (in part):
"This option is provided temporarily to provide a transition period in
case some external kernel module needs one of these symbols anyway."
but it's not clear if that means that it was a *one-time* transition
aid which is now unnecessary, or whether it's an *ongoing* aid which
might be used at any time.  currently, there are no invocations of
EXPORT_UNUSED_SYMBOL[_GPL] anywhere in the tree.  so does that mean
this feature can be tossed?  or might it still be used every so often?
