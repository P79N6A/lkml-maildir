Argh, forgot to cc my reply to someone else's question to the ML. The 
problem could be traced to a faulty DIMM - by coincidence it was only 
used while fscking; even during an attempted kernel rebuild no problems 
arose (or rather: make ran into a different problem before it caused 
RAM-related problems). That's why it took me so long (more than three 
weeks and two mainboards, in fact) to figure out what it was.
For the sake of completeness, I found out when I finally resorted to 
installing Windows so I could at least test the GPU and the setup CD 
kept bluescreening.
Sorry to needlessly bother you.
