Why would it?  Sync deals with write requests, read requests are left as-is.
Notice that in your tree the thing shuts readahead requests down is
invalidate_bdev() and we don't want to get it called - for very obvious
reasons.

Sure.  But there may very well be requests coming into driver from the
queue.

Umm... So you want sync to wait for read requests, not just the write ones?
That would certainly be enough, but that's not what everyone expects from
sync...
