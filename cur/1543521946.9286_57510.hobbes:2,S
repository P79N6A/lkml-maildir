Aaaargh. Resync time... Actually it's wrong way to handle that stuff -
correct one being per-disk instead of per-major. I'll have that done in a
couple of days.
Ob_gendisk(): Linus, why on the earth do we have this ->init() thing
there? It should be called from driver initialization code instead of the
middle of partition_setup(). Modules are calling it directly anyway,
conditions wrt interrupts are same, so what's the reason for postponing
the thing? IOW, will you accept moving the call to initialization and
removing gendisk.init?
