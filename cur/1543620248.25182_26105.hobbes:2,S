The latest version of the PnP BIOS driver, available at:
   
http://panopticon.csustan.edu/thood/pnpbios.html
refrains from reserving ioports 0x3f0 and 0x3f1.  This
is a temporary fix for the floppy problem.  I hope
someone will fix the floppy driver soon so that this
change can be reverted.
Note that at earlier version of the driver was included
in 2.4.18-pre7-ac2 and an even earlier version was
included in 2.5.3.  If you are using either of these
kernels and you don't want to update the pnpbios driver
then boot with "pnpbios=no-res".
