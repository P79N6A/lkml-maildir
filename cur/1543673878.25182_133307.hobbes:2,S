GET_APIC_ID was moved into mach_apic.h (it used to be wrapped in
CONFIG_X86_SUMMIT in apicdef.h). However, init_apic_ldr()  in
mach_apic.h uses hard_smp_processor_id() (in smp.h), which to complete
the circle, requires GET_APIC_ID from mach_apic.h
You did get around it in the generic subarch (which I love, by the way,
thanks so much for doing that work), but in a roundabout way. (via
#ifdef APIC_DEFINITION trickery).

Yea, ok. I guess we can move GET_APIC_ID out into its own mach specific
.h file. That will eliminate the circularity as well. I'll respin the
patch later today.
thanks
