Of course, and even if it's built into the kernel tree it doesn't have 
to be monolithic (one binary.)  Current kinit is monolithic (although 
there are chunks available as standalone binaries, and I have gotten 
requests to break out more), but that's mostly because I've been 
concerned about bloating the overall size of the kernel image for 
embedded people.
