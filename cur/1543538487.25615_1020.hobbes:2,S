Forget that 101%.
The most above quote tells me that scheduling latency is practically
reliable with 10 ms latency (while taking account those not-to-do's).
If only 7 ms peaks are observed, it looks 101% reliable to me.
It would be very silly to talk that Linux would have 1 ms latency
if it reaches it only once a week. Get the point? Lets not talk about
4 ms latency but 7 ms from practical point.
Development point is that 4 ms is reached at most of the time and somehow
we should get those 7 ms occasional latencies away. Remember, this was the
situation before Ingo's patch, and I'm sure we reach the reliable 4 ms
latency.

I was not suggesting that. We should look at a possible good way to solve
this problem. I'm not happy with 4 ms audio-I/O latency, but it could be
reached. I'm willing to dig in to this mess just in case more people means
more suggestions, at least in this case.

My own audio code design is a far from a hack. Everything is very well
organized, well thought. I would like to see if I'm able to say my opinion
in kernel's low-latency matters from non-hacker's point of view.
>Huh ? What's "the most important points of how kernel works" ???
How about telling what are those 6 points where the patch additionally
schedules? A good start. You don't need to give me a full lecture.

Yep. I would like to see more scientific analysis, and would like to help
on that.
>Since there are MUCH less pre-emption points.
Were they choosed the same way than Ingo choosed his points?
Empirically based on a program analyser whatever...?
If yes, we at least have a way to improve if this patch is ignored
as well.
Yes, I think Ingo's patch is kludge, and wonder if this new one is
another kludge.

Hey, I just wanted a short cut for understanding the issues related to
low-latency audio, not the full lecture on kernel design.
