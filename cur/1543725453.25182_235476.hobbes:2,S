What aspects of it do you find unnecessary?  The second thread is
needed to maintain the current high/low priority semantics (without
that, you'll either starve regular tasks with a lot of softirqs, or
starve softirqs with a busy userspace, depending on how you set the
priority of the softirq thread).

Why is it "clearly wrong"?  As far as I can tell, the only legitimate
use of it currently is to protect against deadlock (as in
spin_lock_bh()), which is not an issue if all softirqs run from a
thread.  Ksoftirqd already ignores such disabling (unless I'm missing
something?), so code that uses it to synchronize with a softirq is
already broken.
There's also the possibility of code relying on it also being
preempt_disable(); if that's happening, it could be left alone
(though IMHO it'd be better if such code made its dependence on such
behavior explicit), with preempt_disable() being the only real
effect.

BTW, it was my patch; Yarroll only submitted it to the list (as he
stated at the time).
