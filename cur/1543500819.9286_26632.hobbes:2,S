i think any FS can do it - i've got plans for implementing this in the
near future, it's rather easy with the new pagecache. And we can do it
with minimum lowlevel-fs support. [basically the only thing to protect
against is over-allocation of filesystem resources - thus the lowlevel fs
has to export a free space estimator (doesnt have to be exact, it only
must prevent overallocation) - constructing such an estimator isnt too
hard for most local filesystems. In the quota case it can be a bit more
complex but i dont expect there to be big problems.] The point is that we
only have to allocate filesystem blocks when we write out dirty data. This
means quickly created and destroyed temporary ext2fs files will be
super-fast and involve no lowlevel-fs. (apart from creating/destroying an
inode and calling the [trivial] free-space estimator)
