no, the problem is exactly the opposite. Here's the key observation:

the kernel has detected this process to be a CPU-hog - and indeed the
traces and the above description all say that it really is a CPU hog.
by renicing it to -10 it gets super-attention from the scheduler, so it
can be a CPU hog _and_ create sound.
this is analogous to the 'game problem'. Games too tend to be CPU hogs,
and if anything else is running on the system, they might be hurt and see
longer latencies in getting scheduled. By renicing them the user
(sysadmin) signals towards the kernel that despite these application's CPU
usage pattern, they should get extra attention.
