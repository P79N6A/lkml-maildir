Yeah, that's unpleasant.

Is this page still lookable-uppable in swapcache?  If so, that's the way to
get the refcount on it.
We don't _have_ to use the page lock of course.   A simple
	wait_event(some_wq, !is_migration_entry(entry));
would suffice.
But what prevents this swp_entry_t from becoming an is_migration_entry
swp_pte_t two nanoseconds after we've passed this check?
