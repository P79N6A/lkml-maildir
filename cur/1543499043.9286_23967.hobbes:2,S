Patch 2.5 is a necessary evil.
Necessary...well, there is a good example.
Evil...they screwed over all the older users by totally changing the

I know this is offtopic but does anyone know why they did that?
I end up keeping the old and new around since the new one will munge some
perfectly legal patches. :(
