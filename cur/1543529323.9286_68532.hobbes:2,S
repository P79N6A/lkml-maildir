I'll second that...  after buying into all of the hype on the BP6, I was
sadly disappointed when I was left with a terribly unstable machine
(this was before the "fix-it-all" latest BIOS upgrade and I've since
gotten rid of the board).  Unfortunately, the whole experience has soured
SMP for me.  I am hoping that should I decide to build another dual
Celeron machine around an ASUS dual board, it'll be no less stable than
any of the single CPU ASUS boards I've used with Linux.
