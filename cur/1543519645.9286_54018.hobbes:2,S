I have a 2x 366 system which has this problem at 66MHz. It might be a thermal
problem, however it hasn't improved with adding heatsink paste and a fan to the
BX chipset heatsink. 
It certainly got WORSE if overclocked the system, but it never goes away at
66MHz, it just happens less often.
My suspicion would be board fault, or a timing problem somewhere.
It's not necessarilly a kernel bug, but I think blaming this one on
overclocking is taking the easy way out.
