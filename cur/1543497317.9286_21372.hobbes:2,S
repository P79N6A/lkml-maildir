 Good morning, 
 i've an intel server (slink) which export homes over nfs.
 The client (a sparc with slink) use autofs to mount dinamically homes.
 The problem is with quota, which is ignored if i use autofs to mount only
 user's home which are currently logged and not the entire filesystem.
 The quota works perfectly if i mount the entire file system 
 (mount -t nfs server-name:/home-dir /home).
 I use a configuration like this for autofs
 /etc/auto.master
 /home   yp auto.home
 and the auto.home nismap contains entry like these
 plasma chiara.dei.unipd.it:/home/plasma
 Since the quota should be checked be the server, it's a server problem, i
 think nfs-server. Any idea why this strange behaviour?
 thank in advance
 regards
     Cristian Prevedello
