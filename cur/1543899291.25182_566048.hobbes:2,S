We'll have to solve them as they come.
Face it, hardware drivers _have_ to know about suspend/resume. Even
userspace drivers will have to know about suspend/resume, because they
need to reinit the hw during resume.
Now... most parts of kernel need to know (a bit) about suspend/resume
-- at least enough to play nicely with refrigerator. In retrospect it
is pretty obvious that this covers fused, too, unfortunately noone
noticed that when fuse was designed.
Can we try to solve the suspend vs. fuse problem now? "Just removing
the refrigerator" is not the answer. First, refrigerator is impossible
to remove in few months timeframe, and second, it does not solve the
problem anyway.
(Actually, there are two separate problems with suspend vs. fuse.)
