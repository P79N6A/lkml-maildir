capabilities all get dropped on the floor across exec().  We discussed this
on this list after Bill and I spent half a day getting cap_pam working,
only to discover that the kernel had been nobbled years ago.

If vendors are forced to ship a nasty hack it often points at problems in
the mainline kernel.  Certainly that's true in this case.
And if we are unable to fix the kernel acceptably then I'd prefer that the
expedient fix be in the mainstream kernel so as to prevent divergence in
user-visible features between vendor kernels.
And let's remember, code-wise, this is a very small change.
If someone comes up with an acceptable SELinux (or whatever)-based solution
then fine.  But it's too late.  This stuff is going out the door to end 2.6
users and that's just tough luck.  The least we can do is to ensure that it
works the same across different vendor's kernels.
