Here is a third-hand suggestion that popped up in a reply to a similar
problem on comp.os.linux.networking:
# RFC 1323 "TCP Extensions for High Performance"
echo -n 0 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_window_scaling
echo -n 0 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_timestamps
# RFC 2018

It turns off some "bandwidth*delay product" optimizations.  We'd be
interested in whether it works for you or not.  Yes, I noted that you've
already tried turning off tcp_timestamps but perhaps one of the others will
make a difference.
