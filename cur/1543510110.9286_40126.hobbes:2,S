I'll take a look.
I had patch which allowed to use > 115K on many chipsets, and Tytso
told me I had better put it into setserial. [I do not know what your
patch does.] I also did lots of cleanups.

PS: Here's what I have. enable_hispeed() needs to be called from right
place.
PPS: I'm also attaching userland version. It would be nice to
integrate my changes to serial.c into official serial.c, plus
integrate hispeed-user into setserial. You only need to perform
enable_hispeed and then tell kernel that uart type is hispeed.
Once you have hispeed-user integrated into setserial, talk to tytso,
and he is likely to accept that into official distribution
