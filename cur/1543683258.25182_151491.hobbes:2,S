I thought that patch got merged already ...

Yes, it seems like all the HCDs (and the hub driver) need attention.
Plus, the enumeration process should respect hubs' power budgets,
and handle overcurrent better.  I had a hub re-enumerate over forty
times not that long ago, just because it enabled too many things at
once and the surge currents made lots of trouble.  Plenty of power,
if it got turned on carefully enough... :)

Agreed, this needs work.  Some USB device drivers will likely need to
implement suspend()/resume() callbacks, which thoughtfully enough the
driver model conversion already gave us.  At one point it was planned
to have it automatically traverse the devices and suspend, leaves up to
root; and resume in the reverse order.  Is that behaving now?
Suspend should likely enable remote wakeup (trevor.pering@intel.com
has been asking about that), at least as a config option.  That'll
be useful for things like keyboards and mice.
Now's probably a good time to work on this sort of integration issue.
I'll be glad to see contributions in this area.

There's already code in the OHCI driver to handle that for some
of the Apple hardware, as you know.  And it should kick in on at
least some of the power management paths; although not all, as
Pavel has noted.
