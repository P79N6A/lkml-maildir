Umm, Jeff, for years if you rmmod netfilter it very will
do this for you even if you have firewall rules installed.
This behavior exists in all of 2.4.x
People who do modprobe -r in their crontabs are asking
for trouble, losing their netdevice is the least of their
trouble especially if they have firewall rules installed.
Module reference counting added complications to net device
handling, and once I killed it off we could begin addressing
all of the real bugs that exist with network devices.  For example,
now that we're foreced to make net devices dynamic memory in all
cases we can deal with dangling procfs/sysfs references to the device
sanely.  Fixing that was not possible with module refcounting.
