Its a known problem. Use the Red Hat kernel tree for now and all will be
well. I've spent some time working on this and after a long false trail caused
by what appear to be very very nasty bios bugs in the ASUS AM7-266D mainboard
I think I have the i2o_block and i2o_core problems sorted for x86, at least
on the FC920 and Promise cards I have for testing. i2o_scsi I have some thinking
left to do and may not be able to fix because it works on my cards and fails
on some others.
Fixing i2o for 2.5 is a major undertaking and I don't plan to address that
until close to the point 2.5 is frozen for a new stable release.
