batch_requests at least in my tree matters only when each request is
512btyes and you've some thousand of them to compose a 4M queue or so.
To maximize cpu cache usage etc.. I try to wakeup a task every 512bytes
written, but every 32*512bytes written or so. Of course w/o the
wake_up_nr that I added, that wasn't really working w/ the _exlusive
wakeup.
if you check my tree you'll see that for sequential I/O with 512k in
each request (not 512bytes!) batch_requests is already a noop.
