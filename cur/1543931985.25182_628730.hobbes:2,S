I think there is sense in it if you do it subtly differently.
	printk(".. if this hangs do ... \r");
	edd_stuff();
	printk("                          \r");
So that we display it, do the EDD call, then write over it with whatever
is next that matters.
That way you'd only see it when it hung - and that might be worth a patch
and test from someone.
