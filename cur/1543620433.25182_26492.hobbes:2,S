   That is incorrect. The warning occurs because someone made bogus changes to
   the vesa driver without understanding what was going on. The vesa frame
   buffer returned by the BIOS is a physical cpu address not a bus address
   and nothing to do with magic PCI mappings.
There were no changes made, in fact the VESA driver by your own
definition was buggy before my changes went in. :-) It was using
bus_to_virt and virt_to_bus all along Alan.
