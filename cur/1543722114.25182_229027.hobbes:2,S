Wouldn't it be nicer to define a more generic style like
struct page *dma_to_page(struct device *, void *, dma_addr_t)
??

Yes, the struct page pointer is needed for vma_ops.nopage in mmap on
ALSA.  So far, this is broken on some architectures like ARM.  We need
a proper conversion from virtual/bus pointer to a page struct.
Of course, mmap is not mandatory, and we have a fallback via
ioctl/read/write.  But it's important to _know_ whether remapping is
available...
