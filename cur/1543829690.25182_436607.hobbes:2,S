Yeah, I was using CONFIG_MODE_TT with 2.6.17 to test the inode
slimming patches, mainly because it was a lot easier to test each
patch one at a time, and UML was working just fine for me.  The only
reason I was using TT was because it had always worked before, so I
just carried over the .config file and I didn't know that TT mode was
getting deprecated.  (I was using UML with 2.6.17-mm1 to port the
patches to the -mm tree so they could get wider testing.)
