Hello!
With 2.6.13.4 I've problems on several machines:
- IBM Thinkpad 600: Hangs (no panic, simply dead) after HDC (cdrom)
  is initialized [Works with 2.6.13.5]
- Dell Latitude C400: Keyboard does not work
- new HP-Servers (ML-350): Hangup when syslog is started
What information do you want to have from those machines?
lspci, dmesg, cpuinfo, .config when running with older kernels?
The kernel configurations are used from the versions before, with running
make oldconfig before.
Greetings,
Nico
