Con,
I've just tried your benchmark against a vanilla 2.4.19 and 2.5.34 
Results:
_NO LOAD_
Kernel		Time		CPU
2.4.19		7:37.99		99%
2.5.34		7:47.68		99%
_IOLOAD_
Kernel		Time		CPU
2.4.19		11:23.86	65%
2.5.34		10:48.24	72%
_CPULOAD_
Kernel		Time		CPU
2.4.19		9:07.80		82%
2.5.34		8:50.56		87%
_MEMLOAD_ [Probably wrong with 2.5*]
Kernel		Time		CPU
2.4.19		10:00.63	78%
2.5.34		7:45.80		99%
Hope it helps.
Ciao,
         Paolo
