  Would non-trivial process pipelines create fairly fast switch rates
and possibly deep RQ's?  It seems to me that one of the early ANSI C
compilers was a 6 stage compiler implementing each phase of
compilation in a separate binary.  Pipeline the stages and you have
six process running.  Obviously this compiler was less optimal than a
2 pass compiler, but it would have been easy to debug.
