Hello
	sorry if I'm mailing this twice, but there is a kernel bug in
linux 2.2 and linux 2.4. Linux 2.0 is not affected. I tested also
FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Windows 95 and DOS and they all work.
	The problem is that linux doesn't find the video card: after
lilo has loaded the kernel the screen becomes black. The system boots
regularily but the screen stays black forever.
	In this PC I haven't configured any framebuffer and there isn't
X Window. The video card is a TRIDENT 9660 and it is integrated on the
mainboard.
	I tried to access the system via ssh and I tried to issue the
lspci -xvv command. You can find the output (along with the output of
pciconf -l from FreeBSD) on 
http://www.gest.unipd.it/~iig0573/lspci.txt
lspci can't find the video card; FreeBSD finds it on 0:9.0
	I tried then to boot with pci=direct, bios & conf1 (as somebody
told me) but anything changed. I tried also vga framebuffer and to pass
the vga=ask argument to the kernel. Nothing changed. 
	With vga=ask the system asks to choose a video mode. The system
can also scan all the video modes of the card. But if I choose any of
them the screen becomes black. After some investigation I think the
problem is in arch/i386/boot/video.S but I haven't the skills to debug &
solve.
	Please, help me, I really hope to use linux on this PC...
otherwise I must use something else.
	Thank you,
	Gianluca
