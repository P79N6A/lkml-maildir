I'm afraid we have different understandings of what a "guarantee" is.
Don't we?
Guarantee may be one of
  1. container will be able to touch that number of pages
  2. container will be able to sys_mmap() that number of pages
  3. container will not be killed unless it touches that number of pages
  4. anything else
Let's decide what kind of a guarantee we want.
