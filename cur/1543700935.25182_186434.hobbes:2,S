After some fixing on ide-scsi my DI-30 is now working fine. I don't know 
of any bugs in it. All works fine for me. Getting rid if ide-scsi might 
be a good idea but it ain't going to be easy as a lot of programs are 
using the code.
 If you need a tester for the di-30 please feed me the patches and I'll 
play around with them.
Cheers,
Stef
