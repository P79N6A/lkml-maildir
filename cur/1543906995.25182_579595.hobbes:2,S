Subject: [PATCH] Enable lguest drivers in Kconfig
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/8/5/228

Lguest drivers need to default to "Y" otherwise they're never selected
for new builds.  (We don't bother prompting, because they're less than
4k combined, and implied by selecting lguest support).
