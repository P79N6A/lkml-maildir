Thanks, Christoph: your split_vma mods in 2.5.33-mm1 fix that issue.
(Linus didn't apply my patch: maybe he just missed it, or maybe he 
saw, as I later did, that it would be a lot better to use splitvma
inside move_vma, instead of second-guessing what do_munmap might do.
But when I went to do so, I recoiled in fright from trying to work out
the right handling of splitvma error which move_vma currently forgets.)
