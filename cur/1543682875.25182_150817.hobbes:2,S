you can eliminate the security implications for all fd types by
simply translating
	open("/dev/fd/N",...)
to
	dup(atoi(N))
w.r.t. fd N in the current process
the problem is that linux took an implementation shortcut by symlinking
	/dev/fd/N -> /proc/self/fd/N
and by the time the kernel sees /proc/self/fd/N the "self"-ness is apparently
lost, and it is forced to do the security checks
if the /proc fd open code has access to the original /proc/PID/fd/N path
then it can do dup(atoi(N)) when the PID is the current process without
affecting security
otherwise there is a bug in the /dev/fd/N -> /proc/self/fd/N implementation
and /dev/fd/N should be separated out to its (original) dup(atoi(N))
semantics

 for
an early (bsd) discussion of /dev/fd/N vs. /proc/self/fd/N
