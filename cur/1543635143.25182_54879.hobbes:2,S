But, this at least means that we don't need to protect 
file->private_data during the open itself, right?

Well, I certainly have the hardware to measure the difference.  But, I 
seem to remember several conversations in the past where people didn't 
like this behavior.

Yes, something less controvertial, please!  A dumb implementation 
would be pretty easy on top of current semaphores, but I think it was 
already done (see above).
