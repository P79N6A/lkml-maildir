Btw, might there be any idea in making the kernel just to freeze if a new
trap occurs while displaying the Oops dump. It's the first dump that is
important. Any subsequent dumps just scroll the important data away from
the screen. 
A crash during crash is a sure indication that the system is out of
business anyway (memory and/or kernel code is corrupted).
Best regards,
