AFAIK: I could take BSD- (or ISC-)licensed code (legally), patch it,
sell it (nor not) and (legally) not give back anything putting the whole
code effectively under proprietary license.
And you can't do anything (except negative propaganda) independent if
you are maintainer, author or whoever.
And you seriously have a problem with GPLed patches (which is BTW more
"open" since you cannot legally hide the changes once you gave a binary
away - at least from the receiver of said binaries)?
BTW it's the same as with other "open code": Take it or leave it - it's
your decision.
SCNR,
