This was the approach I tried to make it cache friendly.
These are the problems I faced.
- Reader checks the write_active flag. If set, he waits in the global read
queue. else, he gets the lock and increments percpu refcount.
- the writer would have to check each cpu's read refcount, and ensure that
read refcount =0 on all of them before he sets write_active and 
begins a write operation.
This will create a big race window - a writer is checking
for a refcount on cpu(j), a reader comes on cpu(i) where i<j;
Let's assume the writer checks refcounts in increasing order of cpus.
Should the reader on cpu(i) wait or go ahead? If we use a global
lock to serialize this operation, we the whole purpose of maintaining
per cpu data is lost.
- If the reader decides to wait on cpu(i) and the writer on cpu(j+1) 
finds refcount!=0,do we have both reader and writer waiting?
Or should the writer perform some sort of a rollback, where he wakes up
the readers on all cpus i < j+1?
- When a reader is done, he decrements his percpu refcount. But, a 
percpu refcount = 0 does not mean there are no active readers in the 
system. So the reader too, would have to check for each cpu refcount
before he wakes up the writer in his queue. this would mean 
referencing other cpu's data.
- How do we deal when a reader takes a lock first on cpu(i) gets
migrated to cpu(j) during an unlock. Again, we have to cross-reference 
other cpu's data.
I tried and gave up. But I would love to have this whole thing
implemented in a more cache friendly manner if we can.
Thanks and Regards
