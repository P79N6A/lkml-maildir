Hello list,
an info for the enthusiastic:
I have played a little with my new cd/dvd/whatnot writer and just had this 
idea (see pic). Well then, DVD+RW makes it possible.

The worst thing is not the atime update (as cdrecord-prodvd manual says), but 
the initial mount / log replay which seeks a lot more.
Commands used were:
  cdrecord-prodvd -dev=/dev/hdc -format -v
  mkreiserfs -f /dev/hdc
(Looks like the =/dev/hdc method works best (besides =ATAPI:x,y,z or 
=ATA:x,y,z), even though cdrecord bleaks about it.)
And the question aside: is writing CD-RW in packet mode also supported in 2.6, 
like DVD+RW is?
