This looks like erase not working properly... This usually happens
after switching back from X as X tends to leave some garbage in some
engine registers, and is usually cured by switching to another console
(this is why I tend to force-reinit the accel engine on console switch).
Since your problem seem to not depend on XFree, I suspect something
else hairy is going on with the engine, I don't know what yet though,
I'll try to find some clue.
In the meantime, can you send me a dmesg output ?
Thanks,
Ben.
