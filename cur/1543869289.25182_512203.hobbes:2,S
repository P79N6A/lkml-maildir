You're right; I overreached there.  I haven't measured branch
misprediction penalties in dog's years (I focus more on system latency
issues these days), so I'm just going on rumor.  If your CPU vendor is
still playing the tune-for-SpecINT-at-the-expense-of-real-code game
(*cough* Itanic *cough*), get another CPU vendor -- while you still
can.

Do you not understand that real user code touches FPU state at
unpredictable (to the kernel) junctures?  Maybe not in a database or a
web server, but in the GUIs and web-based monitoring applications that
are 99% of the potential customers for kernel AIO?  I have no idea
what a %cr3 is, but if you don't fence off thread-local stuff from the
threadlets you are just begging for end-user Heisenbugs and a place in
the dustheap of history next to Symbolics LISP.

Dude, it's thread-local, and the glibc wrapper around most synchronous
syscalls touches it.  If you don't instantiate a new TLS context (or
whatever the right lingo for that is) for every threadlet, you are
TOAST -- if you let the user call stuff out of <stdlib.h> (let alone
<stdio.h>) from within the threadlet.
