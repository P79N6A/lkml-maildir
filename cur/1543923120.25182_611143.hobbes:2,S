It would be easier to review the actual locking changes if you did the 
SlabXXX removal in a separate patch.

Memory barriers deserve a comment. I suppose this is protecting 
page->flags but against what?

We don't need preempt_enable for CONFIG_SMP, right?

This needs a less generic name and maybe a comment explaining that it's 
not annotating a proper lock? Or maybe we can drop it completely?

This is hairy. Perhaps it would be cleaner to have totally separate 
functions for SMP and UP instead?

Same here.
