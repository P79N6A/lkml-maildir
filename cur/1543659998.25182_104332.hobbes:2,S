FUD. The keyboard is a matter of taste and I for one haven't seen a
better one fitting my typing needs. One mouse button is not a problem
on the road, because I rarely need a mouse at all and the others are
emulated. When really needing a mouse a trackpad is not a solution 
anyway because it often doesn't come with a scrollwheel (which would
disqualify most notebooks but a few Sony Vaios anyway), solution is
an external mouse which I always have with me (and also had to have with
any other notebook I had so far FWIW).
You can see quite a few developers in the opensource scene with an Apple
notebook and you would be surprised where some applications would be
today if those notebooks where "not for real work".
