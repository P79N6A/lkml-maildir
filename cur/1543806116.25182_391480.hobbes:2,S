Sorry for the delay. I had to fix a totally bogus patch (mine ;).
The problem with your patch is that it hides too early mntput's. Think about
following situation:
 mntput(path->mnt);   // too early mntput()
 dput(path->dentry);
Assuming that in-between this sequence someone unmounts the file system, your
patch will wait for this dput() to finish before it proceeds with unmounting
the file system. I think this isn't what we want.
Regards,
	Jan
