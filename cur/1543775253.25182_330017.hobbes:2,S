devfs has been marked OBSOLETE for a year now.  It has also been
documented as going away.  Because of this, you should not have been
supprised at all.

What are the speed differences that you see?  I've tested it and on a
slow old laptop, with a lot of devices, udev only takes 2 seconds to
initialize the whole device tree.  If you put it in initramfs, it will
take no additional time, as it will operate on all of the hotplug events
as they happen.  Can't get faster than "nothing" :)

That's probably a good idea.
