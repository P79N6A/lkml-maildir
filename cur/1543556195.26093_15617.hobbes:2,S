Sure I bet it works, but you just broke all the programs that currently
use any of the above ioctls. I've known about this for years... You
can do all that you want with cdrom_msf, it's just more hassle. For
2.5 I'll introduce newer variants of the above ioctls and keep them as-is
for compatability, tossing them out is not an option.
I will take a patch that corrects the comment though!
