and it still happens ;(
I un-emerged nvidia-drivers & checked via dmesg |grep nv -> it wasn't
loaded, but the box also hanged
it's a little tricky to reproduce it:
I tried it with root-account: firefox-bin, thunderbird-bin wouldn't trigger
user-account (with used account-directory of both apps):
thunderbird-bin triggers it more reliably
probably it has to do with the x86 compatibility apps of gentoo ?
gentoo amd64-users with 32bit firefox & thunderbird - anyone able to
reproduce it ?
it seemingly is being caused by softirq (see pictures; the zen-sources
is also using parts of rt-kernel); approx 1 minute later there also
was a spinlock lockup by syslog-ng (?)
I'll recompile the newest git-sources and see if it's still triggered
with hardirq & softirq disabled ...

 (<--
omploader is down so I'll host the picture somewhere else)
hope there's everything revelant to see / read ...
I'll recompile the kernel in question with debug-info probably this
evening - if I find some time, you guys also need frame-pointers set ?
this also happens with rc7-based kernels, btw
