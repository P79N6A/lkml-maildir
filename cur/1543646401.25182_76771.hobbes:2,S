Ok, that definitely clinches it - it's the cache miss coupled with host
bridge confusion that causes it to start fetching from PCI space instead
of RAM (or, more likely just get really confused about it and maybe 
fetch from both).
It's always good to understand why someting doesn't work, rather than just
revert it because it breaks inexplicably.
