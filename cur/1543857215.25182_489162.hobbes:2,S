I've added a comment to explain whats going on here, and also the
following patch. I know it could be better, but its still an improvement
on what was there before,
Steve.

Subject: [PATCH] [GFS2] Change gfs2_fsync() to use write_inode_now()
This is a bit better than the previous version of gfs2_fsync()
although it would be better still if we were able to call a
function which only wrote the inode & metadata. Its no big deal
though that this will potentially write the data as well since
the VFS has already done that before calling gfs2_fsync(). I've
also added a comment to explain whats going on here.
