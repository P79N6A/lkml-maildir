Also,
You will probably ask this question when you try to use it.  The volume
name it expects is the driver letter.  If your volume is drive E:, then
would enter "E" for the volume name.  NT assigns drive letters to
logical partition it detects.  If you volume is really trashed to the
point the boot record and mirror record are trashed, you may need to
manually assign a drive letter so NT will see the partition.  Use the
"dosdev" utility to do this.  You will need to locate the device context
in NT object space (a text string path to the partition).  There are
several utils in the DDK that will let you look at the NT kernel symbol
space and associate a drive letter with a partition device context). 
Email me if you have problems.
