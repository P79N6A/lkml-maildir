Hi
I tried using the 2.4.12 kernel on my machine and it won't even boot. I get a
LIL- and nothing after that.
>From what I've seen, the 2.4.11 had some serious problems and 2.4.12 was an
attempt to address those. I think 2.4.12 still has issues so I dropped back to
2.4.10.
You might want to try 2.4.10 if you can.
