(See attached file: 08-ide-scsi.patch)Hello,
I have two problems with building kernel version 2.5.6.
 - kernel cannot be build with ide-scsi support. Attached patch solves my
problems.
 - ALSA cannod be sucessfully build for AWE 64 without CSP support. depmod
for snd-opl3-lib.o fails and driver does not initialize itself
