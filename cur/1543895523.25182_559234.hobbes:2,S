Sorry.  I stand corrected.  I didn't mean to disagree with the "in my
opinion".  I guess I was too distracted by the beauty of your kind
words ;-)  Sorry, it takes some effort to take focus away from that.
I agree that this is your opinion, and you're entitled to it, no
matter how much I disagree with this opinion.
I disagree that what TiVo did is good.  I think it is wrong on ethical
and moral grounds, and I think it is bad for the user, for the
community, and quite possibly even for TiVo itself.
We can agree to disagree as to our opinions, if you want.
