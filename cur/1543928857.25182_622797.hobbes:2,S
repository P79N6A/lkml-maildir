I think you misread what I said. I implied the exact opposite :-)
I'm trying to show that I understand the problem by saying the above,
that doing this perfectly is impossible, but I also happen to believe
that there are those who have solutions that provide a level of
protection to their users, who ask for such things. Hence my point is
that it's not really our place to debate whether virus scanning is
good/bad but more how to provide a sane API. I'll get a spec.
Jon.
