Fascinating ! But how is this possible ? What stops me from
using this algorithm from entering N values and extracting 
them again in order and so end up with a O(N*log log N)
sorting algorithm ? (which would be better than log N! ~ N*logN)
(at least the web pages I found about this seem to suggest you
can use this on any set with a full order relation)
