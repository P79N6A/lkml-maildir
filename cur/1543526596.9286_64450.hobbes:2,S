But it does really does ingress filtering. Are you sure that your routing
tables were correct and that it was really enabled (just echoing
it to conf/all is not enough). Also if you switch it on you need to 
flush the routing cache (write something to route/flush), otherwise the 
old routing cache entry that was created earlier prevents the source 
validation.
