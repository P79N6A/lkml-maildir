I have found that there is a setting in my BIOS, that says something like
< 64 MB RAM
and the options are 1) OS2
                             2) NON OS2
When the setting is changed to NON OS2, my computer only recognises 14 MB of
RAM. But When OS2 is selected, the computer recognises all 192 MB (if I have
the mem=192M parameter appened).
Maybe this has something to do with the 14 mb problem?
Daniel.
