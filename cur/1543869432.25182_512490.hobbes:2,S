Yes, kinda. But wouldn't the compiler complain if you included both 
input.h and bitops.h (multiply definitions of BIT)?

Sorry about that. Am surprised I didn't notice it earlier...

Is the reason for the modulo to put a bitmask larger then the variable 
into an array? I did just a quick 'grep' for "BIT(" in drivers/input/ 
and from what I saw, most (or all?) of the values are defined constants 
and those in input.h were noway near the limits of a 'long'.
The reason I don't like it with modulo is simply because it hides 
potential bugs (when x is to big). And what about the "1%"?
IMHO BIT should be as simple as possible.
