There is no IDE in the system. The destination for the file transfer is on
cpqarray RAID5. Do you have a recommendation for how I test the transfer rate of
that without stressing the VM?

One of my original tests[0] was to take the cpqarray update from -ac and bring
it forward to 2.4.17. I saw about 20 sec improvement with that, still not
competitive overall with -ac performance. I'll try doing the same with eepro
driver, which is the NIC I'm using.
