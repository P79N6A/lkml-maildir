In this context, it does not. Any hot-swappable hardware could be removed
from the production system, flashed and tested off-line, then restored.
Much safer, and not OS dependent - without any downtime on the production
system.
This approach is only a problem for non-hot-swappable hardware on a
mission critical system, or if you don't have any non-critical systems
with a suitable interface. In the case of IDE or SCSI, this doesn't seem
likely.
