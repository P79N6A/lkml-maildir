Subject: Samba 3.0.2a and smbfs (2.4.21) sometimes missing files (CRITICAL BUG)

Hello,
I'm using the newest Samba 3.0.2a and smbfs which comes in 2.4.21 kernel.
Sometimes or actually always when I copy, rsync or even list files from a
share which resides on NT4 server all the files don't show up (only in
directories which have lots of files >1000 files..)
First I noticed this when I was rsyncing a "mirror" of this share to an
another machine and rsync was deleting some files which still existed in
the NT4-server. After some debugging I made a little test with 'ls -l
/mnt/point/manyfiles | wc -l' and these was the results (no one was using
the share at that time):
2335
2335
2336
2332
2334
2327
2328
This is quite annoying bug. Same thing happens when using smbclient for
example: 'smbclient //192.168.0.1/d$ -U username%password -c "ls
directory/*"|wc -l'
It's quite random which files are missing when doing directory listing. I
also tried to google problem down but nothing more than some random
questions about the same problem without a solution. So could we
investigate this problem more?
(please cc me when replying)
