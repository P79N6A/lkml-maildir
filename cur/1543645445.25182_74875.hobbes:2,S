Block layer being the tag generator (and manager), yes I 100% agree that
if we extend the support of block level tagging slightly it is very
possible to simply generate the type of tag required (as already replied
to Patrick, REQ_BARRIER would be an ordered task attribut, etc).
Currently IDE tcq has no notion of tag options, unfortunately.
