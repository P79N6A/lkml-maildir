Poeple do bad things, and it sometimes gets missed.

The general rule is: no typedefs.
typedefs make sense when the underlying type can change: u64, size_t,
resource_size_t, etc.  We also use them for really hairy definitions like
filler_t.  Nothing else.  Please don't use them just to save typing.

cpp == C preprocessor.
It would be better to do
/*
 * nice comment goes here 
 */
static inline void msp_led_pin_hi(...)
{
	msp_led_turn_off(...);
}
