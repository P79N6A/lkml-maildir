I do not think this should be reverted, as the odds that some one will
rename their network device to be "irq" or something else that is in the
pci device's directory is pretty slim.  It also only shows up if
CONFIG_SYSFS_DEPRECATED is disabled, not the common option.
But I am still working on it, I sent you and Kay a patch that, while it
locks up at boot time, should be close to what we need to address this
:)
