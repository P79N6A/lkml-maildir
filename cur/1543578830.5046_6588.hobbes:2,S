If you use 'idebus=40' or 'idebus=50', the driver will add an extra
margin to the timings, trying to compensate for the 40 or 50 MHz PCI bus
it will be tricked to think it's working with.
This could add a data point, yes.

UDMA1 is 22.2 MB/sec, UDMA2 is 33.3. UDMA0 is 16.6.
Could you (if didn't already) send me the lspci -vvxxx after the -X65
(UDMA1) command, together with the one before? That also could tell
something.

Actually, the CRC messages are safe and only mean a data transfer is
retried. That is, only if it doesn't fail every time. They happen on
many boards and drives using UDMA even under normal correct operation :(

If 'fails after several hundred megabytes' only means a single CRC error
which is recovered from correctly, then that actually means 'working and
probably would work perfect with a shorter cable'.
