So what's a reasonable value for 'not just above' and 'not just below'?  We
could skip the entire hole, which would give us reasonable behavior for the
brk area, but it wouldn't work so well for the area below the stack.  I'm
sure if we define a 'reasonable' value to skip someone somewhere will
collide with it.
