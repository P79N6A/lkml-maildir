From OSDL STP, on the 4-cpu platform
OSDL-aim-7 test, using the new_dbase workload. 
AS looks very good, tho i will be repeating for confirmation. 
(Would be happier if both runs were on same machine)
I was told that CFQ is still WIP,
test was already on a machine when i found out, so it's included.
