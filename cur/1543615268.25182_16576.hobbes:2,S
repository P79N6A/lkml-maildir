No.  You still have the problem of using pointer arithmetic past
one past the end of the object.
C99 6.5.6/8:
   If both the pointer operand and the result point to elements of the
   same array object, or one past the last element of the array object,
   the evaluation shall not produce an overflow; otherwise, the behavior
   is undefined.
