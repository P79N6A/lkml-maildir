So what's wrong with collecting the slaves' receive stats and reporting
them as stats for the bonding driver?  At least then you can quickly see
the total for all devices currently owned by the bonding device.
Stats are just a tool so that you can see if things are behaving
properly, you can report back whatever you like.  I prefer to have the
bonding driver collect the slaves' stats so you can easily see if
enslaved devices are receiving packets.  If you want to see which device
is getting more traffic, that's easy to see by looking at the individual
slave.
