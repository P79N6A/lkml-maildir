If it works, then you can just take a huge textfile and it will be
compressed immediately if you put the c flag on it? Or do you have to
read/write it afterwards, or do you even have to start with a touch
file?

What does nodiratime do exactly? A quick grep on the kernel source
didn't educate me, and man mount only mentions noatime.

Hmm, do you have an url about this? How is it possible that data is
still on disk if you write 0's and 1's over them? (or am I missing
something?).
Thanx!
