Stephen Hemminger has already added TCP port randomization on
connect() to the 2.6.x tree.  See
net/ipv4/tcp_ipv4.c:tcp_v4_hash_connect(), where randomized port
selection occurs.  And unlike your patch, Stephen did add ipv6
support (via net/ipv6/tcp_ipv6.c:tcp_v6_hash_connect()) for
port randomization as well.
I'd like to ask two things:
1) That you use netdev@oss.sgi.com for networking patches as that
   is where the networking developers listen.
2) That you do some checking to see that the feature you're adding
   is not already present in the tree.
Thanks a lot.
