| Ah OK, that sounds all right.  I was reacting to the "broken
| userspace" in the patch description which at first glance seemed to be
| saying that userspace (i.e. pppd :) is doing something which has
| recently been declared to be wrong and therefore it is "broken".

David, if you pick this patch could you rename
the subject then as Paul proposed? Or I should
resend the patch with new title?
To Paul: my bad, sorry. I thought like -- I broke
user-space pppd so it's broken now and lets fix
it -- here is "fix broken userspace" grown from :)
