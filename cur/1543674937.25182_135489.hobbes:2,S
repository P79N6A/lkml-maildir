Sure - there is lots of stuff that ought to be generic error
handling/timers/requeue/ioctl stuff that right now happens to be in the
scsi layer, and a megaton of user space that only supports it

SATA is SCSI with some legacy crap nailed on the back end, next
generation SATA controllers look like scsi, act like scsi, think like
scsi. The bang a register count to ten poke a couple of bits and babysit
the command world of IDE is dying. 
Also with regards to the confusion comment, several vendors now have
identical hardware interfaces for their smart SATA and SCSI devices.
dpt_i2o has an ATA form, aacraid has a SATA form so the confusion 
problem about device names also won't be going away in a hurry.
