2.6.16 with this patch and your former patch applied, crashes during
stressing a raid5 connected to a MV88SX6081.
2.6.16-rc6 crashes too.
2.6.16-rc6-mm2 is rock solid wrt sata_mv.
I get no output of the crash on netconsole. Would it help if I get the
output of the crash (if any)? In that case I'll connect a screen and see
what it produces.
I'll test 2.6.16-rc6-mm2 with your patches now.
I'll also try 2.6.16-rc6-mm1 to see if it is fixed between -rc6 and
-rc6-mm1, or between -rc6-mm1 and -rc6-mm2.
As soon as 2.6.16-mm1 comes out, I'll check to see if sata_mv still
works for me. Whatever fixes it should stay in :-)
