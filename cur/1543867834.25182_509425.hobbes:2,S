There's nothing strange about it.  Promoting (as opposed to mandating)
contributions is a great possible, even probable consequence of the
GPL, but it is far from being the whole point of the GPL.
If Linus' whole point had been to funnel back contributions, assuming
he fully understood the GPL back when he chose it, he'd probably have
chosen a different license that *required* contributions to be
funneled back.  And then Linux would have remained non-Free Software.
