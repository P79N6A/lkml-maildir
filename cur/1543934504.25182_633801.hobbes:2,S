Subject: [PATCH] aio: partial write should not return error code.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

When an AIO write gets an error after writing some data (eg. ENOSPC),
it should return the amount written already, not the error.  Just like
write() is supposed to.
This was found by the libaio test suite.
