all these things have trade-offs, plenty of people are happy with the
current balance
for those that are not you can use something else

i don't see how for ordered updates that can occur,  otherwise they

i've seen both KDE emacs loose data by crashing, does the fix for that
belong in the fs too?

let's see a patch, please give details of performance differences
i don't think the current situation is all bad or even undesirable,
yes, it is a balance and i think it's fine as-is
what you want a much more high-level semantics in the filesystem which
possibly will have large performance implications.  im not sure such
semantics are *required* to be in the fs or should be there
also, this is fixing the relatively rare case where the system
crashes, which to be quite honest is a bigger concern, why no seek
solutinos that deal with more common failure modes like applications
crashing or bahaving badly?
