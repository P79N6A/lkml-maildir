I don't have a good sampling of applications.  The one's I've used are
temporal like gpg, or they mlockall the whole thing and never look back.
But I did a quick benchmark since I was curious, a simple loop of a
million lock/unlock cycles of a page that could trigger a merge:
vanilla
(no merge): 659706 usecs
patched
(merge):    3567020 usecs
Heh, I was surprised to see it that much slower.
cheers,
