  Tried PDC20268 + 20262 and the IDE channel order is still rearranged
in 2.5 even though the BIOSen now initialize in bus order (it can
boot from hd again.)
  Why it goes from (1,2,3) in 2.4 to (1,3,2) in 2.5 is still a mystery.
I could see it reversing, but not this.
  Tried 2.5.66-ac1 with no APIC support and IDE was still backwards.
It also spewed continuous keyboard errors until I hit reset:
   atkbd.c: Unknown key (set 0, scancode 0xfc, on isa0060/serio1) pressed.
