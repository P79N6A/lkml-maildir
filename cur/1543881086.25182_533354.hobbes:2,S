A significant bugfix for SMP balancing was just posted for the staircase 
deadline cpu scheduler which improves behaviour dramatically on any SMP 
machine.
Thanks to Willy Tarreau for noticing likely fault point.
Also requested was a version in the Makefile so this version of the patch 
adds -sd045 to the kernel version.

Renicing X to -10, while not essential, may be desirable on the desktop. 
Unlike the CFS scheduler which renices X without your intervention to 
nice -19, the SD patches do not alter nice level on their own.
See the patch just posted called 'sched: implement staircase deadline 
scheduler ymf accounting fixes' for details of the fixes.
