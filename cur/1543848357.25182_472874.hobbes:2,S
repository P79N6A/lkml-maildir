Looking at it again, my explanation seems wrong: I can't see any danger
of calling down to the _driver_ there (there's no remove_vma): rather,
it's __remove_shared_vm_struct we're avoiding by setting vm_file NULL.

Yet in your patch below, you do nullify vm_file _after_ unmap_region.

So I'm not sure if we are!

Yes, it would be quite okay to defer the fput until after the
unmap_region; but there's no point in making that change, is there?
