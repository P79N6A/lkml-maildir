mproper does a wash in your kernel source, removing junk from old
compilations (or old tries...), like dependencies, core files, and so on.
Is highly recommended to run make mrproper at each new kernel compilation.
But now you can say: Sure, doing this i've lost my configs. I tell you:
Right, but just copy after the build the .config file. And, voila, you have
your config in a secure place (until you delete it.).
Hope this helps. More info at kernel's top dir/README,
Documentation/Changes and linux-kernel@vger.rutgers.edu :)
