Open source does not work by telling about some seemingly good idea you 
had and expecting other people to implement your idea.
Open source works by you implementing your idea.
Try it yourself, and you will see the technical problems of your idea
(e.g. porting userrspace code to the stack-limited kernel or crashing 
the whole computer with bugs in the libraries) yourself.

Please do your homework before spreading wild guessings and ideas.
