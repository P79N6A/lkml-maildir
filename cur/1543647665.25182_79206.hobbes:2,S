Should EVMS be included, the team will make it our top priority to resolve 
the disputed design issues. If the ruling should be that some of our design 
decisions must change, so be it, we will comply. Certainly some changes can 
not be done by the 20th or 31st, however I feel the team can handle most 
changes before 2.6 ships.

More accurately, we do use generic block layers structures to present 
volumes that are visible to the user/system.

The point of contention is that EVMS does not provide generic access (block 
layer operations) to the components that make up the volume, but only to the 
user/system accessible volumes themselves. EVMS consumes (primarily disk) 
devices and produces volumes. The intermediate points are abstracted by the 
volume manager.

I guess it comes down to the point of whether the block layer should evolve 
to also handle volume management generically, or whether volume management 
is separate component that utilizes and works with the block layer.
Linus, if you feel that volume management and the block layer can and should 
be separate components that work together, then EVMS is ready today, and at 
least functionally, could be a pretty good starting point. As a separate 
component, only the EVMS tools would have to know or care of the new EVMS 
APIs. The volumes EVMS produces, being standard block devices, interface, 
interact, and operate as any other block device does today.
