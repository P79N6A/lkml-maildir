That last wmb is suspect. We dont put an wmb after a spinlock to "make it
visible". If you think of an wmb as an ordering tag that propagates out
through the cpu and storage hierarchy then wmb is not going to help us here.
I guess the store could get reordered (and so delayed) a bit, but an wmb
is relatively expensive on some architectures.

It would be interesting to compare a spinlock or rwlock against a frlock
in a write mostly situation. Actually isnt it going to be slower because
we have to take a spinlock to serialise around the frlock write path?
