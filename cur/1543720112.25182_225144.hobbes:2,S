Hi,
just a lousy bugreport... I noticed that agpgart doesn't work anymore on
2.6.7-rc2. Xorg reports that AGP isn't supported, and dmesg doesn't show
the
agpgart: Putting AGP V2 device at 0000:00:0b.0 into 4x mode
agpgart: Putting AGP V2 device at 0000:00:10.0 into 4x mode
It only shows
Linux agpgart interface v0.100 (c) Dave Jones
agpgart: Detected Apple UniNorth 2 chipset
agpgart: Maximum main memory to use for agp memory: 565M
agpgart: configuring for size idx: 4
agpgart: AGP aperture is 16M @ 0x0
Using 2.6.6, it works fine. 
hth,
