Hi Jamie,
Thanks for posting the summary of your experiment - very useful!

What's the basis for deciding wheter SHMLBA is defined or not? There are
definitions of SHMLBA in include/asm-sh/shmparam.h and
include/asm-sh64/shmparam.h for the kernel.  The sh64 /usr/include/asm
headers have effectively the same thing (not identical because the copy
I'm looking at hasn't been synced with the latest kernel sources), and I
assume the sh userland is OK too (haven't checked though).
In both cases the kernel headers are showing correct and useful values :
16k for SH-4 in the sh file (16k direct-mapped, or 32k 2-way associative
on latest devices), 8k for SH-5 in the sh64 file (32k 4-way
associative).
Cheers
Richard
