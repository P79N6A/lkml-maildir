Here is a quick overview:
I am able to make a connection to a Win2K share and access all the
directories and files, except one.  It is rather large also...  When I
access try to access the directory, it will leave the error:
smb_proc_readdir_long: name=, result=-2, rcls=1, err=123 in the
/var/messages.  It normally shows 0 files in the directory, but if I enter
'ls' enough times it will give me roughly half the files in the directory.
I am listing the properties of the directory below.
Size: 225GB (241,700,612,216 bytes)
Size on disk: 225GB (241,760,051,200 bytes)
Contains: 17,466 Files, 1,215 Folders
I was running 2.4.18 with the Hendrick patch to support a 160GB HD.  I have
since moved up to 2.4.19pre10 hoping the fix the samba problem, I have also
upgraded to the latest Samba on the server, thinking a new smbmount might
help. None of this made a difference. 
Let me know if there is any other information I can provide.
Any suggestion will be appreciated...
