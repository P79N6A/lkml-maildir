Well, as far as I know it's still officially 2.95.3 for both 2.4 and
2.5.
There shouldn't be _major_ problems compiling with 3.2, but it has had
far less testing, so something like a filesystem corruption bug could
go unnoticed for longer if it wasn't happening with 2.95.3 compiled
kernels as well.
