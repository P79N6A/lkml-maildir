No, not for me alone. Probably only I and Thomas Osterried have systems 
where it is so easy to reproduce. Please note that the problem exists on 
my all systems, but only on one it is critical. It is enough to run
"sync; sleep 1; sunc; sleep 1; sync; grep Drirty /proc/meminfo" to be sure. 
With =>2.6.20-rc1-git8 it *never* falls to 0 an *all* my hosts but only 
on one it goes to ~200MB in about 2 weeks and then everything dies:

Different, depending on a host: mail (postfix + amavisd + spamassasin + 
clamav + sqlgray), squid, mysql, apache, nfs, rsync, .... But it seems 
that the biggest problem is on the host running mentioned mail service.
Thanks.
