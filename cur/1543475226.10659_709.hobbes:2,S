I don't think it does confuse or scare anybody, but rather tell the truth: 
 The way your kernel was compiled, it only supports 960MB of phys.
 RAM. If you want more, you have to change it. But there's a drawback, if
 you have processes needing very much virtual memory.

This is the better approach, I agree.

As said, you don't need full understanding. sed s/0x.0000000/NEWVAL/ will do
the job.
