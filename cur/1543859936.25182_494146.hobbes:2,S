sorry for the late answer, I totally missed your mail....
I'm not sure I get what you are saying but this is what's there under
2.6.19.1
 ls -al /sys/class/sound/audio/
insgesamt 0
drwxr-xr-x  2 root root    0 2006-12-24 16:12 .
drwxr-xr-x 22 root root    0 2006-12-12 17:53 ..

these are the two entries /sys/class/sound/audio*
the only difference between the kernels before my last mail about the
issue is that with .19.1 i can use the sound hardware which was not
possible beforehand; it was simply dead after the borked dmesg.
if you need anything else, please dont heasitate to mail. thanks.
