I understand the points of both of you well enough. But how come this is interpreted 
as saying I'd "toss this piece of code over the wall"? I can understand getting tired 
of cowboy coding jobs, but there is a misunderstanding here.
Of course do and will I maintain that code and every issue related it. I have been
maintaining, improving, testing this code for 9 months. The protocol spec (RFC 3828)
was developed at University of Aberdeen, and there is continuing research into 
UDP-Lite here, i.e. it is not a `dead' project. That is why I held back regarding the 
IPv6 port: I can ensure that this (IPv4) code is up to standard and to date, but am 
lacking the required additional time to implement the same for IPv6. 
I am trying to contact people to help with the port, but for the moment I will take 
responsibility only for the IPv4 version.
And if there is someone `well-known and respected' who is interested in taking this code 
over, I would only be happy for him/her to do this. But I won't simply `disappear' :-)
