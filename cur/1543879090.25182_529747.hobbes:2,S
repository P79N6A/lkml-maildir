init_idle()?  Yep in sched_init.  I wondered where that happened
for the initial idle thread.  Ugh. That is the first thing that
we fix after we fork init as well.  So yes it would be a good
idea to fix that...
I was expecting init_idle() to happen after we forked kthreadd. I almost
wonder if I should move init_idle....
Anyway that is one bug caught.
