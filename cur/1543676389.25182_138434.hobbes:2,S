AFAICS the patch implements semmnu and semume, correct? The current 
implemention permits an unlimited number of undo structures.
1) Why do you want to introduce a limit? Have you found a potential DoS?
2) What is counted by semume? Individual undo entries, or undo arrays? 
Linux differs from the normal unix sysv implementation: there is a per 
process, per semaphore set array of undo entries.
