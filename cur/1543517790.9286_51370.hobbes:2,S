It's always been so. Sorry if I am been not clear. I was talking about the
VFS not about lowlevel fs. I don't either know why coda especially 
dislikes hardlinks.

This works fine for a .gnupg directory but I just don't like to close the
door completly to be sure that an rm will delete my files. I can take in
my home directory useful stuff. I just don't like the idea that when I
delete a file, the same inode could stay  allocated somewhere with my
ownership and the admin may think I moved my file there.

Yes. I think it's a minor issue as you just need root involved also for
sharing rw some file in a limited workgroup.

Really it seems nobody cares about the implications of the problem and if
nobody needs the change I don't need it either for myself. So probably
it's better to put the change in an unofficial patch (for example in the
Solar's secure-linux patch with the stack not executable stuff?) so very
special cases will have a way to go with linux.
Actually AFIK there's no such a patch floating around but it's very
trivial to implement. Something like that should do the trick. It's not
checking the gid field yet as I am been too lazy (if somebody needs
I can produce a fully featured one).
