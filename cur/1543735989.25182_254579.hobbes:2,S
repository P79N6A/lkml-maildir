In case it's not clear what this is about, it about lynx not being able
to dump the whole page but hanging in the middle somewhere. Where seems
to be at the same point, though changing the MTU changes that.
With 2.6.7, lynx dumps this page, as it seems, in one stroke. Just now,
I tested it with 2.6.9-rc2-bk8 and I do get the whole page, but it hangs
for half a second or so at the same point and then continues the rest of
the page.
I found this problem after a report that our squid proxy wasn't able to
get some web pages. The reported page was on the service provider in the
above link. So it's not a lynx thingy. Even tried it with netcat, same
result. Also different linux-2.6.8.1 boxes (one dual P200MMX, celeron700,
PIV-2.4GHz) and 2.6.9-rc2-bk8 only on celeron700, with different network
adaptors (eepro100, ne2k_pci, ne).
