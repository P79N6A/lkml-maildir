James,
Thanks for the reply.  We will resubmit the patch to rollback it to our
original implementation.
Regards.

OK, read the thread; Matthew is right.  What you propose would pretty
much destroy compat ioctl handling within the driver.  You need a compat
handler for MEGASAS_IOC_FW.
With your current patch you'd get a failure both from a 64 bit binary
running on x86-64 and if someone ran the x86 binary on ia64.
The driver already uses the compat infrastructure, it shouldn't be too
hard to add this in the correct manner.
