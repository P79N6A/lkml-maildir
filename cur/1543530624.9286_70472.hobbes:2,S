The "ACPI" here is not the ACPI configuration option the kernel talks
about, but simply the internal driver knowledge about the power management
interface on the 3c575 network card, which is ACPI-enabled.
What seems to be happening is that the PCMCIA layer has ejected the card
and freed the PCI device structure, but the driver still used it. Boom.
The problem seems to be that the vortex driver doesn't detach very nicely.
I would LOVE to have the vortex driver too just converted to the new PCI
driver interfaces which are less likely to have this kind of confusion
(synchronization between PCI events and PCMCIA events).
