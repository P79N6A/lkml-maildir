Subject: [PATCH 0/5] UML - Optimizations and fixes for 2.6.22
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/4/26/523

Patches 2 and 3 are more work on making tlb flushing more efficient.
Patches 1 and 4 are trivial.
Patch 5 fixes a problem with virtualized time not being fully virtual
with the kernel's current timekeeping.
