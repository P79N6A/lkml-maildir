It seems to me that kernel/cpu matching can be broken into two relatively 
simple parts.
1 - Put a cpu "signature" in the kernel image indicating cpu requirements; and
2 - Have the bootloader (lilo) detect cpu type and match it against the cpu 
"signature".
The bootloader would then load the kernel, or could give an informative 
diagnostic.
