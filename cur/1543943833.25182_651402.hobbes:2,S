Subject: [PATCH] Documentation: prune redundant SubmitChecklist items
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/2/10/314

From: J. Bruce Fields <bfields@citi.umich.edu>
Kernel style is mentioned twice, and the git apply trick is a bit
redundant given the checkpatch.pl recommendation (which also checks for
bad whitespace).
