Me too.  But at least we'll *get* a report if someone does spurious
wakeups.

Sure, I jumboed them together for feedback from you guys.
All users I am currently aware of won't care either way.  Current
test-5 is:
				Sees Changes		Sees FUTEX_WAKE
			   from another MAP_SHARED   from another MAP_SHARED
MAP_PRIVATE read-only:		Y			N
MAP_PRIVATE read-write:		Y*			N
MAP_SHARED read-only:		Y			Y
MAP_SHARED read-write:		Y			Y
[* Only until page is written to, after which COW splits them ]
Previously, the FUTEX_WAKE column was identical to the first column.
Now, IMHO, this new semantic is more sensible, but I don't really
mind.
But I don't recall anything about believable use of RO futexes: Jamie?
Cheers,
Rusty.
