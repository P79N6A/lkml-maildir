James,
The submitted previous version of megaraid (2.20.3.1) had 
register_ioctl32_conversion & unregister_ioctl32_conversion 
defined to empty statements if CONFIG_COMPAT was _not_
defined.
But I think the preferred way was to have the occurances of 
(un)register_ioctl32_conversion in the code surrounded by 
#ifdef CONFIG_COMPAT ... #endif directly. In the kernel source
only register_ioctl32_conversion has these #ifdef .. #endif. The
unregister_ioctl32_conversion doesn't.
This patch should take care of that.
Thanks,
Sreenivas
