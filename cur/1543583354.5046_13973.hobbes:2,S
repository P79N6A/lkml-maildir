This was the report:
	[on mke2fs]
	This command hangs my system. It works for a 100K file, but it
	hangs my system, if the file is 470M. It does not matter, if the
	disk is SCSI or ide.
so you pretty much have to assume that he's losetup the files first.
How else could he state that it works for a 100k file, but not for
a 470m one?
BLKGETSIZE will return the device size, nothing unexpected here.
