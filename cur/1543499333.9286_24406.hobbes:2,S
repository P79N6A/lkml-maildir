	The Solaris /devices directory (Under Sparc at least) has much
nastier stuff than that.  I agree the above, however, could be useful.
	What about dynamic devices?  I take it devfs would notify a daemon 
that something new appeared in /devices, and then that daemon would go off
and create the /dev entry?  
	What about module loading by an attempt to access a particular 
device under /dev?  You might be able to simulate that by having symlinks 
for any modules you have, but then, how do we know what modules you have?  
Something in the kernel makefile to create the /dev entries?  Yuck.  
Perhaps the devfsd proggie could create them on boot from whatever is in 
/lib/modules/`uname -r`/*?  That might work, except you could end up with 
lots of junk in /dev, much of it pointing to things that might not exist 
in /kernel/devices.  And might not be able to exist if someone compiles 
modules for hardware s/he doesn't have.

	Now this sounds like you want /kernel/devices to be a filesystem
somehow, and to not be virtual.  Unless of course symlinks can have
permissions...  Or you have something like what devfsd does w/ tar for
/kernel/devices.
	I don't THINK Solaris even does this (I try to avoid playing in
/devices too much).  IIRC, if you remove something out of the system, the
entry in /devices goes away, but the symlink persists, and if the identical
device is put back in the system in the same place, the /devices entry
comes back, and as such the /dev symlink becomes operational again.
	This doesn't keep permissions around, at least, I don't think so,
I could be wrong on this.

	There have been folks asking for it.  So you'd have a
/kernel/devices/cd file(?) that has a list of the /dev entries for all
the devices on the system?  Or have it be a directory w/ symlinks to /dev,
which are symlinks back into /kernel/devices?  I would think someone
looking for CD drives would want to open the 'proper' device under /dev.
	Though, this could all be handled in user-space, and could be
configured by a user.
mkdir /dev/cd; ln -s /kernel/devices/ide0/slave /dev/cd/ide_cd1
	But then, programs couldn't depend on it...
