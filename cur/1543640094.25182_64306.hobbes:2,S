Yes, except that to find the host/pci bridge for bus 0, for example, I need
to run _INI on the device before I run _HID (which is the method that
returns the PNPID). _INI can theoretically access a bus 0 pci config
operation region.
People have mentioned to me that this is unpleasant and I agree, but the
ACPI spec *specifically* says that bus 0 pci config access is always
available.
That said, maybe it is better to keep ugliness caused by ACPI in the ACPI
driver, so if you want to have interfaces that depend on struct pci_dev or
pci_bus, fine, and the ACPI driver can generate a temporary one in order to
call the function. This completely violates the abstraction you are creating
but sssh we won't tell anyone. ;)
BTW this is not just a matter of spec compliance. Some machines actually
didn't work until this was implemented originally.

Is this the one that was on bkbits.net for a while? I liked a lot of what
you did with that, but I was so busy with other stuff I didn't get a chance
to pull it in before it got too stale... :(
