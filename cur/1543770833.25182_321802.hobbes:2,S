It will not work if drives are absolutely identical, however if there is
something even slightly different about them (serial number, model,
firmware version - anything) you can set up udev to produce "stable" name.
FWIW, my example was about a single drive that can "change" it's X,Y,Z
depending on how and when it was connected.

Are you talking about <bus>,<target>,<lun> numbering by any chance ;) ?
Because for the most types of devices out there they don't make any sense
and just provided for compatibility with legacy software.
Also, from a bit different perspective - do you also want users to mount
the CD they burnt using not device (/dev/xxx) but <bus>,<target>,<lun>?
If not why writing application should use different addressing?
