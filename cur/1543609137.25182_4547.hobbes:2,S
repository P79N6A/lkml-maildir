Me thinks the real solution is the ACPI pm timer.  3 times the
resolution of the PIT and you can not stop it.  The high-res-timers
patch will allow you to use this as the time keeper and just use the PIT
to generate interrupts.
Finding the ACPI pm timer, on the other hand, is MOST obscure and not
all x86 platforms have ACPI.  Still, we are almost there.
