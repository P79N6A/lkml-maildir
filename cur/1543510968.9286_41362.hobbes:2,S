It is not yet clear from this line whether it announces itself as removable.
(But no doubt you are right.)

As I wrote yesterday, bit 7 of the first (config) word of the
data returned by the IDENTIFY DRIVE command should be set.
It indicates a removable drive. The phenomena you report
indicate that this drive does not do this.
On the other hand, if I am not mistaken these disks can be instructed
by software to report themselves as either Fixed or Removable,
where Fixed is the from-factory default. If that is true then
only the default is wrong, and you can correct things using a
suitable ATA command.
It would be interesting to know precisely which commands are used
for that job.
Maybe someone can trace their DOS/Windows utility under dosemu
(or just ask them).

The CurSects looks funny, but is in fact OK:
LBAsects=4307184, in hex 41B8F0, and written big-endian
this becomes B8F00041, which is -1192230847 viewed as a
32-bit integer.
