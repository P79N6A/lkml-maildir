If compression could make the data take up fewer cylinders on disk,
and fragmentation is not greatly increased, then seek times would be
reduced.

There are two issues here: disk space and network usage.
gzexe can compress executables, but not shared libraries.  It would
reduce network usage if the cache of decompressed binaries is kept on
local storage.  It works by replacing binaries with a file containing 
a `#! ...' line followed by the compressed original file.
e2compr (
http://debs.fuller.edu/e2compr/
) can compress executables,
shared libaries, and indeed any regular files on an ext2 filesystem,
but does nothing to reduce network usage.  Also, you can't use it for
swap files or files to be used as backing store by the loop driver
(because the swapper and loop driver access the underlying block
device instead of going through the filesystem; this is also why they
can't use network filesystems).  e2compr works by patching the ext2
filesystem code.  It works but is is still in development.
Applying compression to network protocols is another matter.  The
Linux ppp driver already supports this.  Adding compression to the TCP 
layer would be impressive, though a lot of work.  Adding compression
to NFS (or somewhere else in the networking stack?) might be easier.
