Hi,
After I upgrade to kernel 2.4.27 from 2.4.25 I get the following error
in the syslog from keepalived:
Sep  1 09:18:39 cas-lb2 Keepalived: Watchdog: Error connecting
/tmp/.vrrp wdog socket
And when I downgrade again to 2.4.25 the error is gone and keepalived
works a before.
I am using the e1000 driver for my network card's. I have also
backported the e1000 driver from kernel 2.4.27 to 2.4.25 and then I got
the same error there.
So my conclusion is that the e1000 driver from 2.4.27 doesn't work with
keepalived 1.1.7
2.4.25: Intel(R) PRO/1000 Network Driver - version 5.2.20-k1 2.4.27
:Intel(R) PRO/1000 Network Driver - version 5.2.52-k3 <- doesn't work
with keepalived 1.1.7
Has some one the same problems and is there a fix?
Regards,
Dennis
