I'm not a scsi-guru nor a kernel-guru or whatever but nevertheless:
I think it is very obvious that you are able to talk to the driver using
the functions defined for/by the driver.
If the driver is not compiled-in or included as a module you won't be able
to see the harddisks anyway...
Just my guess, maybe I'm wrong but that wouldn't matter.
You said to appreciate "All responses" so this is mine ;-)
