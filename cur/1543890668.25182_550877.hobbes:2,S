Perhaps that's the best course of action. Then again, there can be a
long time between the problem and crash (weeks even). For someone who
can't collect a coredump, it might be preferable to not immediately
crash the box and allow them to try to reboot it at a convenient time.
That was my reasoning for adding the procfs tunable.
Either way, if the machine doesn't crash immediately, I'd like to see a
different error message here. The current one is confusing to users.
They see it and figure "my box didn't crash in 5 mins, so everything
must be OK!"
