I finally got bridging to work with 2.2.5.  The problem was my ethernet
card.  I was trying to use the SMC 1211TX card.  Once I replaced the SMC
card with a 3Com 3C905B card, everything started working.  Same slot, same
interrupt, different driver in /etc/conf.modules.  It was not my cable or
my BIOS.  The SMC card works fine by itself, but not with bridging.
I am convinced that some Linux Ethernet drivers just don't work with
bridging enabled in the kernel.  Someone with more time and expertise than
me should figure out exactly what is going wrong.  That's the bad news. 
The good news is it will work if you have the right Ethernet card.
I also patched br.c to make a packet filtering firewall.  I wrote a
whitepaper about it if anyone is interested.
