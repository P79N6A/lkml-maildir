Just to throw in an alternative: On m68k we map currently everything
together into a single virtual area. This means the virtual<->physical
conversion is a bit more expensive and mem_map is simply indexed by the
the virtual address.
It works nicely, it just needs two small patches in the initializition
code, which aren't integrated yet. I think it's very close to what Daniel
wants, only that the logical and virtual address are identical.
bye, Roman
