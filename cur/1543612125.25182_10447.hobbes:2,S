This is what happens under most of the drivers i've played quake with 
(under DOS too, I think). OSS and OSS/Free, and most of the other PCI 
drivers I've looked at, I believe they don't actually program the DMA 
engine during GETOPTR calls. Actually one could argue that in the case 
of quake it's better to let it chase its tail indefinitely (that's what 
they seem to have assumed when they wrote the game anyway according to 
comments in the source code) because that allows ambient sounds to 
continue uninterrupted during some slowdown, eg possible network 
congestion. (The side effect is that sometimes you end up with endlessly 
repeating weapon sound effects if you fire during congestion but of 
course that coincidence happens less often than congestion itself)

yep...
