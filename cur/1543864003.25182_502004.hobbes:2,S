They just add a few for ZONE_DMA where we alreaday have similar ifdefs for 
ZONE_DMA32 and ZONE_HIGHMEM.

They avoid unecessary complexity on platforms. They could be made to work 
on more platforms with measures to deal with what ZONE_DMA 
provides in different ways. There are 6 or so platforms that do not need 
ZONE_DMA at all.

Hmmm.. How would that be simpler?

I have send you numbers showing significant reductions in code size.
