y'know, I think I think it's been several years since I saw a report of an
honest to goodness, genuine SMP race in core kernel.  We used to be
infested by them, but the term has fallen into disuse.  Interesting, but
OT.

I expect that 2) has the maximum niceness*suitable-for-2.6.23 product.
That's if you actually care much about kernel.org major releases - do many
people run kernel.org kernels on Xen?  If "not many" then we could perhaps
do something more elaborate for 2.6.23.1.  But adding ever more pvops as
core kernel evolves was always expected.
