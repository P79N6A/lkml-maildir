Bjorn,
You have the following registers to consider (for P4/Core):
#define MSR_IA32_PEBS_ENABLE            0x000003f1
#define MSR_CORE_PERF_FIXED_CTR0        0x00000309
#define MSR_CORE_PERF_FIXED_CTR1        0x0000030a
#define MSR_CORE_PERF_FIXED_CTR2        0x0000030b
#define MSR_CORE_PERF_FIXED_CTR_CTRL    0x0000038d
#define MSR_CORE_PERF_GLOBAL_STATUS     0x0000038e
#define MSR_CORE_PERF_GLOBAL_CTRL       0x0000038f
#define MSR_CORE_PERF_GLOBAL_OVF_CTRL   0x00000390
With Barcelona, you'll also have to consider:
#define MSR_AMD64_IBSFETCHCTL           0xc0011030
#define MSR_AMD64_IBSFETCHLINAD         0xc0011031
#define MSR_AMD64_IBSFETCHPHYSAD        0xc0011032
#define MSR_AMD64_IBSOPCTL              0xc0011033
#define MSR_AMD64_IBSOPRIP              0xc0011034
#define MSR_AMD64_IBSOPDATA             0xc0011035
#define MSR_AMD64_IBSOPDATA2            0xc0011036
#define MSR_AMD64_IBSOPDATA3            0xc0011037
#define MSR_AMD64_IBSDCLINAD            0xc0011038
#define MSR_AMD64_IBSDCPHYSAD           0xc0011039
#define MSR_AMD64_IBSCTL                0xc001103A
I think you could organize by groups with a bitmap 
per group and some sorted linked list to keep track
of all of them.
