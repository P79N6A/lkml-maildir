Thanks for the patch.  I'm a bit busy today, but should be able to test
this out later tomorrow if all goes well, sorry in advance for the
delay.
That being said, I have a minor nit:
-config HOTPLUG_PCI_COMPAQ
-       tristate "Compaq PCI Hotplug driver"
-       depends on HOTPLUG_PCI && X86
+config HOTPLUG_PCI_COMPAQ_INTEL
+       tristate "Compaq/Intel PCI Hotplug driver"
+       depends on HOTPLUG_PCI
The device is _still_ a Compaq device, Intel just licensed it from them.
Changing the name to an Intel device does Compaq a disservice, and in
the past, when I accidentally did this, they complained loudly.
So I'd stick to the Compaq name only :)
I'll get back to you with actual technical comments on the patch
hopefully by tomorrow evening.
thanks,
greg k-h
