The behavior described for the chip is that it traps after executing one
instruction.  From the user-mode perspective, the system call instruction
is one instruction that does not normally generate any kind of exception.
It just does one magic thing, that being having the kernel do something for
you.  If someone sets TF in user mode then they probably expect that they
will get a trap after executing one instruction, even that one.

There is no "set SINGLESTEP|SYSGOOD".  PTRACE_SINGLESTEP is a one-time
operation.  PTRACE_O_TRACESYSGOOD is a persistent flag you set when you
intend to at some point use the PTRACE_SYSCALL operation.
