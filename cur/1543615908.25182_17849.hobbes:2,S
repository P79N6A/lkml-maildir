Subject: [patch] O(1) scheduler, 2.5.2-pre9-C1
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

i've uploaded an updated O(1) scheduler patch, against 2.5.2-pre9:
 	
http://redhat.com/~mingo/O
(1)-scheduler/sched-O1-2.5.2-C1.patch
 	
http://redhat.com/~mingo/O
(1)-scheduler/sched-O1-2.4.17-C1.patch
only minimal fixes were added to the code, the goal is to reach a stable
base.
Changelog:
 - fixed the mozilla crash, forgot to revert the ->prio value in
   setscheduler() which caused a wrong index ... (many thanks go to Pawel
   Kot for testing this out.)
 - fixed a load balancer bug that would get the runqueue count incorrectly
   if there is a RT running. With this fixed a 2-CPU system is completely
   usable even if a RT task is taking up 100% CPU time on one of the CPUs.
 - fix the sys_sched_yield export in ksyms.c (Davide Libenzi)
 - adds an RT event counter to optimize RT scheduling. (Davide, me)
