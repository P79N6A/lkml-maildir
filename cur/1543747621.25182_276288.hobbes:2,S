    There have been recent sonypi patches, althought they're fairly
    minor-looking.  But make sure that you're using the latest kernel. 
    2.6.10-rc2 is ancient history ;)
Yeah, i found out 'sonypi' looks pretty good now as of 2.6.10-rc2, about
15 minutes after the posting.  But didn't want to generate excess traffic
until i had something else to post about.  It now seems to handle software
suspend decently, thank you very much(!), and my earlier problems were due 
to obsolete (as of -rc2) work-arounds.  There is still at least one software
suspend issue that i'm aware of, besides firewire, on a built-in USB device
that i've never used.
I'll report again on pending issues when -rc3 comes out, as i have no 
clues which 'bk' patches are stable or otherwise, and don't have time to
find out for myself right now...  I will check specific releases upon
request or recommendation.
