I think you meant to say RLIMIT_STACK rather than RSS, didn't you, Dan?

Stack RSS should certainly be included in Committed_AS,
but RLIMIT_STACK merely limits how big the stack vma may grow to:
at any moment the stack vma is probably very much smaller,
and only its current size is accounted in Committed_AS.

I'm guessing that the pthread stacks are mmap'ed as greatest extents
(probably because that's the easiest way to keep them apart), rather
than as small MAP_GROWSDOWN areas to be expanded later on fault.
If so, then those would indeed account the maximum in Committed_AS.

I'm suspecting it's an oddity rather than a bug.
