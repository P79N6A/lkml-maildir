It will cause only a slight difference, noise is mainly visible in the
high-frequence parts.

And since you cannot do `exact' comparisons of the luminance due to noise, but
have to do some averaging, you're back to the previous solution: Hence compare
the DC terms of the luminance. They're the average luminance of the 8x8 chunks.
