Andrew, the latter thing is a very good point. For me personally, the fact
that -mm is not available via git is the major obstacle for trying your
tree more frequently than just a few times per year. How difficult it
would be to switch to git for you? I guess there are good reasons for still
using the source code management system from the last century; please
correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe that using a modern SCM system could
make life easier for you and your testers, no?

For busy (or lazy) people like myself, the big problem with linux-next are
the frequent merge breakages, when pulling the tree stops with "you are in
the middle of a merge conflict". Perhaps, there is a better way to resolve
this without just removing the whole repo and cloning it once again - this
is what I'm doing, please flame me for stupidity or ignorance if I simply
am not aware of some git feature that could be useful in such cases.
Finally, while the list is at it, I'd like to make another technical comment.
My development zoo is a pretty fast 4-way Xeon server, where I keep a handful
of trees, a few cross-toolchains, Qemu, etc. The network setup in our
organization is such that I can use git only over http from that server. This
cannot be changed, it's the company policy. In view of that, it's a pity that
quite a few tree owners don't make sure that http access to their trees works
(I added Ingo to the Cc: list in the hope that this will be corrected soon for
the x86 tree, which I am using quite extensively), and I have to use a much
slower machine (a two and a half year old laptop) for these trees. Please see
this:
