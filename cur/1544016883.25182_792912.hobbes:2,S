I'd like to see this trace_mark turned into a tracepoint probe. Having a
periodical interrupt which saves this information is good, but I would
also like to have a tracepoint probe that we could attach at important
execution sites, like sched change, irq, softirq, nmi entry/exit where
we would read the performance counter.

I'd be interested in merging your patchesfor 2.6.28 into the LTTng tree.
Please keep us posted.
