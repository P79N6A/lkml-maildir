But you made big boboo in SPARSEMEM. Virtual memmap is a textbook case 
that was not covered. Instead this horrible stuff that involves calling 
functions in VM primitives. We could have been there years ago...

I think we could start with x86_64 and ia64. Both will work fine with 
SPARSE VIRTUAL (and SGIs concerns about performance are addressed) and we 
could remove the other alternatives. That is going to throw out lots of 
stuff. Then proceed to other arches
Could the SPARSEMEM folks take this over this patch? You have more 
resources and I am all alone on this. I will post another patchset today 
that also includes an IA64 implementation.
