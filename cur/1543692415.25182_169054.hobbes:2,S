It's working fine for me, but I still need to unload some modules before
trying to suspend. In my case, I must remove the CardBus/PCMCIA modules,
the sound drivers and UHCI-HCD for my system to suspend and then resume
properly.
I have created a shell script which, when used with the "apmd" daemon,
makes things work automagically. Thus, simply by closing the lid, the
system suspends automatically.
