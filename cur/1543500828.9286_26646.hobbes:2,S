I thought the 4192 process limit was gone with the latest kernels?
Granted, you'd probably want to be using an ftp daemon which is quite efficient
(eg, internalizes 'ls'), and probably want to run a front-end cache which 
serves multiple connections if possible, but doing it with 6000 processes 
would be an interesting test of how Linux could handle such things.  (hmm,
hopefully an ftp daemon which doesn't touch too much RAM in every process
too...)
