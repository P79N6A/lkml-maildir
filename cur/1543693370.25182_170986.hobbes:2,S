Yes.
However the issue is with XFree86 server rather than with linux kernel.
Also, without knowing _what_ hardware does your motherboard have, e.g.
builtin AGP display controller, or some additional card in an AGP slot,
even XFree86 folks can't help you out.
The minimum data needed for it is   /sbin/lspci -v    output.
You just might have a display card that isn't supported by the XFree86;
yet...
