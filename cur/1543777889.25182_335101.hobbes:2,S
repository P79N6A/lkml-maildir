Hi,
With this function, system needs to mount read-write file systems on
every boot cycle, due to avoid inconsistency between FS and memory.
How did you address this problem? Did kernel check RW FS remained as
mounted on boot up or hibernate time ?
I think I need to discuss with you at San Jose at the beginning of 
this year.
Regards,
Hiroyuki Machida
