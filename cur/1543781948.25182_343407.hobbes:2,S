Linux being a registered trademark is old news.
Linus clarified the whole "Linux is a registered trademark of Linus
Torvalds" thing back in 2000 in a lengthy email to LKML.
He explained both why Linux was registered as a trademark, why he has
to enforce/police it to keep it, and what the groundrules regarding
its use are (and don't worry, it's all quite sensible).
