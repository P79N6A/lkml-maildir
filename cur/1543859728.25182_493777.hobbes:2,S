According to cachetlb.txt:
   void flush_anon_page(struct page *page, unsigned long vmaddr)
         When the kernel needs to access the contents of an anonymous
         page, it calls this function (currently only
         get_user_pages()).  Note: flush_dcache_page() deliberately
         doesn't work for an anonymous page.  The default
         implementation is a nop (and should remain so for all coherent
         architectures).  For incoherent architectures, it should flush
         the cache of the page at vmaddr in the current user process.
                                                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Is the documentation wrong?
