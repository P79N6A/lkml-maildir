Hey guys,
Whenever I suspend to disk without quitting X first, I do not get a
status, ie. 58%
I updated my kernel a couple weeks ago and it miraculously came up, I
was able to get a status when using the kernel.
Then when I just recently updated my kernel again it went away.
All I get now is a blank, but lit, LCD screen with a blinking cursor at
the very top left.
How can I get it to display the status?
Thanks!
George
