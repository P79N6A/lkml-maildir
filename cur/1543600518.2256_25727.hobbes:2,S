Unless you like having all your clients hang when the server happens to
be rebooted, and like having to go round hunting for them in dark
recesses in order to try and fool them into unmounting and remounting,
I'd recommend soft mounts every time!

It would be nice if nfs could do the a remount automatically when the
nfs handle it has goes stale an dit discovers it.  Is that part of v3
nfs or not?

But soft mounts at least break nicely and automatically.  And since
failures are inevitable, I prefer them.
Come to think of it, why not have an option that does a hard,intr but
sends a ^C automatically to all referents when a stale handle is detected.
