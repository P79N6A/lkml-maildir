Subject: can't resume with recent kernel

Hello,
I have an IBM ThinkPad 600E. It runs perfectly with 2.6.15.1: namely, I 
can suspend (apm -s) and resume without trouble.
I just upgraded to 2.6.16.18. Suspending works fine, but resuming just 
locks it up completely: terminal cursor doesn't blink, caps lock won't 
respond, can't VT switch, etc. As far as I know, my .config was the same 
for each.
I can try to see exactly when this got broken, if that would help.
Thanks,
Brannon Klopfer
