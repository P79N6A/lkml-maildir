Obviously you have never programmed an X application. The STANDARD toolkit is
the X intrinsics.
It is complete. Now if you want fancier displays, add the athena widget set.
Or something with more bloat- Motif/Qt/KDE/...
Hell, I even wrote one for a specific application - MUCH faster than any of
the bloated ones on Motif/Qt/KDE... it is even faster than the athena set
because I eliminated everything that didn't apply to my application. It was
also only 10% of the size of any of them.

Yes there is. They ALL work together. Write to the X standard and you won't 
have any such problems.
So? It is about choice. It is about standards. Motif is a standard. KDE/QT
is another (just not the same).
Inter-application communication is defined by the X protocol using the ICCM
standard. As far as I know they all do that.

There is always an easy answer. Use the one approprate to the problem.
Of course you must know the problem, and you must know the tools you have
available. without that you better start learning.
One of the BEST things about X is that it is platform independant. This
gives me the ability to cut and paste from a QT application (kmail) into
a Motif terminal window, or even into an Xaw based xterm (or into TGIF, a
diagraming tool). I can even cut and paste from Mozilla without serious
problems.
Each application may be running on a completely different system.
You really need to go an learn some X programming.
