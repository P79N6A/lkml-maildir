I have an older MSI motherboard and when I enable the following option:
From lshw:
        description: Motherboard
        product: MS-6730
[*]   IO-APIC support on uniprocessors
I get the following errors in dmesg:

I normally do not use this option (which also gets rid of the errors*1), 
but I am curious, why do these errors occur?  I remember them with the early
2.6.x series and they are still re-occurring in 2.6.22.1.
The weird part-- is when IO-APIC is disabled, I see this on boot:
IO-APIC DISABLED:
[   46.902712] XFS mounting filesystem md0
[   47.017322] spurious 8259A interrupt: IRQ7.
[   47.273009] Ending clean XFS mount for filesystem: md0
IO-APIC ENABLED:
[   46.851012] XFS mounting filesystem md0
[   47.103066] Ending clean XFS mount for filesystem: md0
* 1 Anytime I see a spurious interrupt on (usually older hardware) 
especially during file I/O this usually means corruption (from what I 
have seen) that is why I don't really want to trust anything on this host.
Anyone have any idea what's going on here?
Justin.
