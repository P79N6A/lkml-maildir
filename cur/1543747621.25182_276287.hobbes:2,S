I know, but the console and the reset button are 150km away. When I dial
into the machine or try to connect via the network, I cannot connect
with the current kernels. Neither 2.4, because the fork fails, nor 2.6
because oom killed sshd. So I cannot send anything except a service man,
who drives 150km to hit sysrq-F or the reset button.
If this happens the kernel just should make sure to make the machine
accessible and let me repair the problem. Nothing else.
