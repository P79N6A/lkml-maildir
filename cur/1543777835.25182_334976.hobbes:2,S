I can't find now changes of initialization static variables, but i have 
deleted section
dealing up with gcc warning from patch, it would go on a queue later.

I don't know now the difference between API accurately, but I'll study 
it in a few days
and delete this sections from patch, alternatively rewrite the code.

Done.

Yeah, the patch now provides only changes of pci_find problems.
[Gcc will be discussed later, after doing more changes and completing patch
against gcc 4, where are more warnings...]
OK. The new patch is:
http://www.fi.muni.cz/~xslaby/lnx/lnx-pci_find-2.6.13-r3g4_1.patch
and bzipped
http://www.fi.muni.cz/~xslaby/lnx/lnx-pci_find-2.6.13-r3g4_1.patch.bz2
[Kernel version is the same (2.6.13-rc3-git4)]
And the patch now contains only:
* This patch removes from kernel tree pci_find_device and changes
it with pci_get_device. Next, it adds pci_dev_put, to decrease reference
count of the variable.
* Some code was unpretty, or ugly, so the patch provides more readable
code, in some cases.
* Marks the function (pci_find_device) as deprecated in pci.h
