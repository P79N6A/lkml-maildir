I've been lurking awaiting to see such a discussion.  Alerting the PCI drivers that their resources have been changed from underneath them by extending the suspend/resume model, or perhaps (heresy?) adding a new callback entry point specifically for instructing PCI drivers to re-read their BARs, etc. would be a step in the right direction to enable this whole re-balancing work; well, granted root/paging devs bound to PCI devs could be tricky.  It seems entirely natural (to me) that Microsoft would shudder at the amount of work and verification of all drivers to do this, but the Linux community's attitude seems to embrace sweeping changes ;-).
