Subject: [PATCH] Export touch_nmi_watchdog

Sometimes drivers do long things with interrupt off and the NMI watchdog
triggers quickly. This mostly happens in error handling. It would be 
better to fix the drivers to sleep in this case, but it's not always
possible or too much work.
This patch exports touch_nmi_watchdog so that they can at least be 
fixed to not trigger the watchdog.
Matches a similar patch for x86-64.
