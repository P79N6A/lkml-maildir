Involvement of the kernel depends on  how we are treating the elastic 
files:
    -   when files are made elastic, are we increasing the user's quota? 
if so kernel becomes neccessary for if
       -   elastic file is deleted: decrement the user's quota
       -   elastic file is chowned: do the needfull (decrement previous 
owners and increment new owners quota)
    -   when files are made elastic, we are just not accounting the file 
size for the user's quota. In this case I dont see any involvement of 
the kernel,  but will need some other hacks.

Admin assigns quotas to the user with using some case studies, like he 
won't be allocating 500 Mb for a C language course students. We are 
trying to harness some user behavior here. I wish I had some Gartner or 
Forrestor figures to show you that how often _all_ the users use up 
their 100% quota at any given point of time. I'm assuming that this 
*does* happen very rarely and I also assume that my assumption is very 
close to correct. The point is their is some 'free' space available for 
the users who use up all their quotas. Of course this free space is 
likely to be someday fall short for the over-spilling users, but then 
its time to increase quotas of all the users, and its then admin's duty 
to look at this. Perhaps this could become a good indication for the 
admin for increasing the quota of all the users.

I do believe that this system can be done in userspace, but it has its 
own flaws then. Suppose theres a daemon, call it eqfsd. It forks parent 
listens a char device, child watches the disk space usage. A kernel 
module reports the file deletes, chowns to the char device, parent does 
the needfull. Child 'periodically' checks that the threshold is not 
reached. Here what can be done is suppose a user can transfer data with  
say 5 Mbps speed to his account....then we can easily get the minimum 
time required to fill up the remaining free space. Child sleeps for this 
much time minus some value for safety.  i.e. child sleeps for: ( (D - 
Ui) / 5 ) - safety_value seconds.
I'm sure this gotta be slow and *will* slow down the system, so I still 
insist that this should be in kspace.
It cannot be denied that there _are_ applications for such a system that 
we already discussed and theres a class of users who will find the 
system useful.
