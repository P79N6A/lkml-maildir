     This problem arises from the code being half way in between the final
results. The idea was to register a console if we have a displayed.
All we need for printk. When we detect a keyboard to attach to a display
without a keyboard then we would register a tty device then. The idea was
to allow for a setup like having one keyboard and one display as your
normal tty and a extra display as printk display. The code will be
changing lot over the next few weeks.
