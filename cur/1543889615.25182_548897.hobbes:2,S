Well, the pathnames we check against are namespace relative, so no matter what 
pathnames the chrooted processes think they are looking at, we always know 
the actual pathnames up to ``outside the chroot''. Having the same filesystem 
mounted in multiple chroots or in multiple locations in the same chroot 
doesn't matter.
The main problem I see when it comes to defining per-namespace policy is that 
namespaces are inherently anonymous, and there is no obvious way of 
associating different sets of profiles with different namespaces. 
Implementing something to also handle multiple namespaces doesn't seem 
hard -- after all, it's not such a difficult concept -- but I don't have a 
good enough idea what would work best.
Thanks,
Andreas
