I agree and I already fixed this here, so with the next update this will 
look like this:
Subarchitecture Type
> 1. PC-compatible (X86_PC)
  2. Voyager (NCR) (X86_VOYAGER)
  3. NUMAQ (IBM/Sequent) (X86_NUMAQ)
  4. Summit/EXA (IBM x440) (X86_SUMMIT)
  5. Support for other sub-arch SMP systems with more than 8 CPUs (X86_BIGSMP)
  6. SGI 320/540 (Visual Workstation) (X86_VISWS)
  7. Generic architecture (Summit, bigsmp, default) (X86_GENERICARCH) (NEW)
choice[1-7]: 
This has other advantages too, one can see now which options were newly 
added and the individual help texts are accessible.
bye, Roman
