Subject: [PATCH] fix oops on resume from apm bios initiated suspend

Hi Pavel.
Didn't know if you caught this one, but it fixes it for me and others
who responded on the list.  
mm is NULL for kernel threads without their own context.  active_mm is
maintained the one we lazly switch from.
Without this patch, apm bios initiated suspend events (eg panel close) 
cause an oops on resume in the LDT restore, killing kapmd, which causes
further events to not be polled.
