Please, let's at least warn the x86 disassembler opcode folks...

This patch already went into Linux 2.5.5 and 2.4.19-pre3-ac4, sounds
like it may be heading for 2.4.19-pre5.  It's good for kernel debug,
and good for kernel space-saving, but... it confuses disassemblers
which think that "ud2" is a 2-byte instruction: they need to pretend
it's an 8-byte instruction when dealing with the new kernel objects.
I suspect it could be transparent if we used one more byte per BUG, but
that's not how it is, so may affect gdb, kdb, ksymoops, lcrash, objdump...
