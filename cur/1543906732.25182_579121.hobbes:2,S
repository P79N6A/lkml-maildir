Yeah, that's a REV-F

And yeah, that claims that C1E is not on, but:

since this makes it all work for you, it does appear that the AMD local 
timer stops in C1 even when that isn't true, and as such is not useful.
Sad. It probably means that we have to disable the local timer for *all* 
modern AMD CPU's.
Thomas/Ingo - did something change in the local apic programming? Or why 
did this work before? Was it just that we didn't use the local timer apic 
for some other reason?
