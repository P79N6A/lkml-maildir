As of 2.6.9-rc4 (I have verified this to be case all
the way up to 2.6.10-rc2), kernel displays this
message:
Uniform Multi-Platform E-IDE driver Revision:

(blacklisted)
The kernel disables DMA on the CD-R/RW (/dev/hdd) and
of course it would not let me enable it manually
either. Up until 2.6.9-rc3 the drive worked in DMA
mode just fine.
(I have been using this drive for more than 4 years. I
have used it under 2.2.x, 2.4.x, >=2.5.50 in DMA mode
just fine. Although I have changed everything else in
the computer in those long years: CPU, M/B, RAM, HDD
etc., save this great CD-R/RW drive, which has been
working fine.)
So the question is: why?
(And what can I do to enable DMA again?)
Thank you.
Hari.
