This has been done before, on (Classic) Mac OS (the program's name was
RAM Doubler). It was *far* faster than Apple's swapping implementation,
although I don't know how much of that was due to the compression and
how much was due to Apple's horrid virtual memory implementation back in
the day. It also had some stability problems, but that could have been
due to the implementation quality rather than to the overall approach.
