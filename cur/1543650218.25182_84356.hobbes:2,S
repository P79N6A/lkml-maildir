Hello,
I have a new WDC WD800BB drive running on an ALI15X3 IDE controller. The drive 
comes up with
hda: 156301488 sectors (80026 MB) w/2048KiB Cache, CHS=9729/255/63, (U)DMA
at boot and is set to mdma2 mode. If I set UDMA33 with hdparm the following 
message appears in the syslog:
hda: set_drive_speed_status: status=0x58 { DriveReady SeekComplete DataRequest 
}
hda: dma_intr: status=0x58 { DriveReady SeekComplete DataRequest }
hda: CHECK for good STATUS
After that the drive runs happily in udma2 mode. Can somebody tell me what the 
(error) message (CHECK for good STATUS) means? 
Btw, why is the drive not set to UDMA(33) on boot (like the other 80 GB 
Samsung drive)? I haven't found the drive in the ida-dma.c UDMA blacklists. 
Could this be some braindead BIOS thing? I had to flash a beta BIOS (Asus 
P5A-B) to get the board to boot with the 80 GB disks at all.
Regards,
Oliver Feiler
