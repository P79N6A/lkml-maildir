Sorry for the late reply...
Steve Pratt seem to have a SDET setup already and he did me the favor of 
running SDET with a reduce dentry entry hash table size.  I belive that
his table suggest that less than 3% change is acceptable variability, but
overall he got a 5% better number using the new hash algorith.
