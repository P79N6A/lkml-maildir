I can do this sometime, I did it in the patch I posted for example. If
you want transparency and genericity you can still do it in userspace
with an LD_LIBRARY_PATH that loads a libc that builds the hole-lookup
data structure (tree?) internally, and then passes the hint to the
kernel if the program suggests 0.
OTOH I prefer those kind of algorithms (if needed) to be in the kernel
so they're faster/cleaner and also a lib would need some magic knowledge
about kernel internals virtual addresses to do it right.

in short it checks if there's 'len' free space at address 'start', and
if there is, it maps it there, without having to search for the first
large enough hole in the heap.
