Subject: 2.6.16-rc1: iptables broken on ppc32?
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

When trying out kernel 2.6.16-rc1 on a ppc32 box (G4 eMac),
the kernel refused to load my /etc/sysconfig/iptables. strace
on /sbin/iptables-restore shows that the kernel returns EINVAL
instead of accepting the configuration:
setsockopt(3, SOL_IP, 0x40 /* IP_??? */, "filter\0\214\0p\0\230\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0"..., 1664) = -1 EINVAL (Invalid argument)
The exact same configuration is accepted and works on an x86 box
also running 2.6.16-rc1, and of course the configuration worked
in all kernels up to and including 2.6.15 on the ppc32 box.
A much simplified /etc/sysconfig/iptables that fails on ppc32 but
works on x86 is the following:
*filter
:INPUT ACCEPT [0:0]
:FORWARD ACCEPT [0:0]
:OUTPUT ACCEPT [0:0]
:RH-Firewall-1-INPUT - [0:0]
-A INPUT -j RH-Firewall-1-INPUT
-A FORWARD -j RH-Firewall-1-INPUT
-A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT
-A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT -i eth0 -j ACCEPT
COMMIT
My 2.6.16-rc1 kernel configuration includes
CONFIG_NETFILTER_XTABLES=m
CONFIG_NETFILTER_XT_MATCH_STATE=m
CONFIG_IP_NF_CONNTRACK=m
CONFIG_IP_NF_IPTABLES=m
CONFIG_IP_NF_FILTER=m
CONFIG_IP_NF_TARGET_REJECT=m
and the iptable_filter, ip_tables, and x_tables modules were all loaded,
just like they were on the working x86 box.
User-space on the ppc32 box is YDL 4.0 with iptables-1.2.9-2.3.1.
