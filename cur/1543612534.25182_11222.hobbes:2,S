Huh!!
There is a problem: I made a (really small) patch to Config.in saying:
   int  '  Maximum number of cards supported by HiSax' CONFIG_HISAX_MAX_CARDS 8
If I check this in the source, it gives me CONFIG_HISAX_MAX_CARDS as (8)
Can you check this out please. It doesn't look like I could do anything against
this.
How do you make your CONFIG-definitions come back without "()" ?

Stephan
