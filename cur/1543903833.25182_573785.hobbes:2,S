That's what I used when available, especially to properly time stamp 
those commits.  Using the latest date on files included in the archive 
isn't always reliable.
OK so actually what I have is from v0.01 up to v1.0 creating 93 commits.
What is missing is:
 - v0.02 sources
 - v0.10 announcement
 - v0.96 sources
 - v0.99.12 announcement
 - sources for v0.99.13{abcdefghij} (got k, don't know where the serie 
   ends) as well as announcements for all of them
 - all announcements for v0.99.14{a-z} except for pl14r
 - announcements for pl15c to pl15j, 1.0-pre1, and ALPHA-1.0.
Otherwise the archive appears fairly complete with almost 3 years of 
Linux development history captured in a 3MB pack file.
