People don't find it confusing, exactly because it gives them the wrong 
idea about it, neither "API" is restricted to just timeouts or timer.
I don't insist on the term "process timer", but I'd really like to find 
something better than ktimer. We already have kernel timer API, which is 
the primary API for kernel usage (for both timer and timeouts).

Only access to first element is needed, which can be cached in the base.
Please explain the second part.

The return path can also get it from the base.

Testing a pointer is not "arbitrary", we do it all the time in the kernel.

Where I think it's possible to separate the timer from the interval 
functionality to get a simpler timer base implementation.

Not really, these fields have to be initialized and maintained, which 
quickly goes beyond "micro optimizations".

That's not all what I had it in mind regarding complexity, I just started 
with the more simpler parts and never got to the more complex part.

This is fine, but then you should explain them, I'm not a mind reader, so 
that I can guess what you're planning.

In this case you don't interpret the spec, you ignore the spec. (I'll 
leave it open whether that's a good or bad thing.)

It doesn't explicitly specify which resolution (see the previous mail).
It doesn't explicitly specify how this rounding has to be implemented.

A portable application simply cannot make this assumption.
Anyway, it's rather confusing how you ignore the spec, when "it makes a 
lot of sense" and OTOH how you can stick to the spec. I honestly don't 
know how to argue on this basis, where the spec can be arbitrarily 
redefined based on undocumented assumptions.
