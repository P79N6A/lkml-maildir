This is weird.  When I touch a file, the timestamp on the file is
7 hours ahead of the system time (I'm in the US/Pacific time zone,
which is UTC -0700):
    [root@srv01 /root]# date
    Thu Jul 13 13:57:03 PDT 2000
    [root@srv01 /root]# touch fred
    [root@srv01 /root]# ls -l fred
    -rw-r--r--   1 root     root            0 Jul 13 20:57 fred
Both the system and hardware clocks are set to the current local time
and correct timezone (PDT).
So, being the stupid person I am, I must ask a couple of questions.
First, just how the devil does the filesystem forget about the date
offset?  And the second question: How do I fix it?
I need an answer fairly quickly, so feel free to call/email directly.
This is wreaking havoc with one of my customers' databases.
