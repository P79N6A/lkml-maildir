So it's that time again.  We need to decide which of the queued sched
patches should be merged into 2.6.17.
I have:
sched-fix-task-interactivity-calculation.patch
small-schedule-microoptimization.patch
#
sched-implement-smpnice.patch
sched-smpnice-apply-review-suggestions.patch
sched-smpnice-fix-average-load-per-run-queue-calculations.patch
sched-store-weighted-load-on-up.patch
sched-add-discrete-weighted-cpu-load-function.patch
sched-add-above-background-load-function.patch
# Suresh had problems
# con:
sched-cleanup_task_activated.patch
sched-make_task_noninteractive_use_sleep_type.patch
sched-dont_decrease_idle_sleep_avg.patch
sched-include_noninteractive_sleep_in_idle_detect.patch
sched-remove-on-runqueue-requeueing.patch
sched-activate-sched-batch-expired.patch
sched-reduce-overhead-of-calc_load.patch
#
sched-fix-interactive-task-starvation.patch
#
# "strange load balancing problems": pwil3058@bigpond.net.au
sched-new-sched-domain-for-representing-multi-core.patch
sched-fix-group-power-for-allnodes_domains.patch
x86-dont-use-cpuid2-to-determine-cache-info-if-cpuid4-is-supported.patch
I'm not sure what the "Suresh had problems" comment refers to - perhaps a
now-removed patch.
afaik, the load balancing problem which Peter observed remains unresolved.
Has smpnice had appropriate testing for regressions?
