It's a given.. are you seriously contending that if you combine two
copyright works you are not obliged to conform with the conditions of
the license on one of them when making a copy of the combined work?
If you are just arguing about the term, what term do you find more
appropriate?  Compilation?
You guys seem to love pointless semantic arguments.  Are you always in
violent agreement?
