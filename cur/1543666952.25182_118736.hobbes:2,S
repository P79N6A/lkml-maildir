The following patch should do what I was thinking of:
--- linux-2.5.65-full/drivers/mtd/maps/Kconfig.old	2003-03-20 16:56:25.000000000 +0100
+++ linux-2.5.65-full/drivers/mtd/maps/Kconfig	2003-03-20 16:56:45.000000000 +0100

 config MTD_UCLINUX
 	tristate "Generic uClinux RAM/ROM filesystem support"
-	depends on MTD_PARTITIONS
+	depends on MTD_PARTITIONS && !MMU
 	help
 	  Map driver to support image based filesystems for uClinux.
 
Any comments on whether this is correct?
