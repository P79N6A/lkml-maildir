Hello,
We plan to install Linux (2.4.21 and later with epoll patch) on an Intel
Server Board SE7501WV2 with 1 XEON 2.4GHz CPU, 4GB PC2100 DDR memory, and
a Seagate 120GB ATA 7200RPM harddisk, and use the server box for high
demand SpecWeb99 tests. Does anyone have any experience on this Server
Board, and see any compatibility problem here?
An other question about this box is the two on-board Gigabit Network
Controller. Do they work fine on Linux? May I use fiber Giganet NCI like
Netgear GA621 on it?
Any thoughts/information are welcome.
Thanks a lot
- Yaoping Ruan
