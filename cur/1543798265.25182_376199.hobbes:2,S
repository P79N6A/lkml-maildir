At least in the first version I'd prefer not to do draw the dialogs over 
each other. It's just weird if a string dialog pops up over the help text.
In the next version we should add some infrastructure to properly layer 
windows on top of other (and should also help with resizing).

The <esc><esc> as described in mconf.c still produces two exits, which is 
a little annoying if one is used to it. I don't know how easy it is to 
supress that second <esc>.
Otherwise it looks good. Regarding merging please coordinate with Sam and 
if you move it, I'd prefer to keep it in a subdirectory, e.g. just "mv 
scripts/lxdialog scripts/kconfig/lxdialog".
bye, Roman
