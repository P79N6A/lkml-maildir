The hell it is.
a) kernel has *NO* *FUCKING* *KNOWLEDGE* of fs type contained on a device.
b) kernel has no way to guess which options to use
c) fs _type_ is a fundamental part of mount - device(s) (if any) involved
are arguments to be interpreted by that particular fs driver.
d) permissions required for that lovely operation (and questions like
whether we force nosuid/noexec, etc.) are nightmare to define.
Frankly, the longer that thread grows, the more obvious it becomes that
file-as-a-dir is a solution in search of problem.  Desperate search, at
that.
