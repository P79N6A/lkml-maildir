This makes a lot more sense than I expected to hear. This argument 
alone is enough for me to understand the reasoning behind the kernel 
knowing how to interpret a shell script. Problem is, the program 
would not be fragile or hackish - it'd be almost as simple as a 
"hello world" program.
#include <unistd.h>
int main() {
  /* if this fails the system is busted anyway */
  return execve( "/bin/sh", "/sbin/init.sh", 0 );
};
-- This program would do the trick nicely, and since init is run as 
root, there is no need to worry about the program having to grab 
privs. 
However, the real problem is that this would break the initrd systems 
used by most distributions for installation, and it would probably 
break most of the "early userspace" systems just coming into use. As 
I said originally - my  comment about having the shell itself 
interpret the sh_bang would break a lot of stuff and I've been shown 
that I have to spend more time in the kernel code (as I haven't 
finished going through the various drivers to see how those have been 
made to work) before I can make a good suggestion in a discussion 
like this.
