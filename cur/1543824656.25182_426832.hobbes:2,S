I also disagree with this change at all. The callers of request_firmware
should not fiddle around with kobject's to make this work. All of them
have their struct device and they should use it.
So I would propose that we fix the caller and the not request_firmware
code. However one option would be calling it with NULL as device
argument and it registers itself a dummy device for the operation.
