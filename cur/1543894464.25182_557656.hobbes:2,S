See also the September 29, 2006 entry where we set up an email address to 
forward license violation reports directly to them so we wouldn't have to 
deal with any of it.
I'd say this "hasn't cost me a dime", but I believe I'm on my third stamp.
(I also note that I'm not busybox maintainer anymore and Erik isn't uclibc 
maintainer anymore either, but since it's our copyrights they're basing the 
enforcement actions on, they still bounce an email off us every few months.)
