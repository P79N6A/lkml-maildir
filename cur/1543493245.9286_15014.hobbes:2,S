I'm busy trying to get a new disk for www.nl.linux.org
and I'm willing to host the site as well.
Btw, I'm also hosting a mailing list which seems to be
perfectly suitable for a project like this:
	kernel-doc@nl.linux.org
OK, the name doesn't seem to be entirely on-topic, but
I guess the kind of activity and the target audience is
_exactly_ the same :)
Majordomo@nl.linux.org is happy to accept your requests...
