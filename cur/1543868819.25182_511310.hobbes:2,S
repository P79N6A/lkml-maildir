Greetings,
I just got a unusual message from lockd on a webserver running a
custom compiled 2.6.13.4 (yes it is ancient, I know).
# uname -a
Linux webserv.somedomain.example 2.6.13.4 #1 SMP Wed Nov 16 10:03:05
CET 2005 i686 unknown
# dmesg | tail -n 3
do_vfs_lock: VFS is out of sync with lock manager!
lockd: weird return 1 for CANCEL call
lockd: weird return 1 for CANCEL call
The server seems to be running fine, so I'm not really worried, but I
thought maybe someone would like to know. :-)
