I just took a peek at the code.
The version on bugzilla (last attachment, comment #22), which was
reported to work correctly, has the MAC address reversal hardcoded.
The driver in 2.6.18 has some logic to detect if it should reverse the
MAC address. So it looks like a hardware oddity/bug that the driver
wants to fix but fails. I'll see what happens if I force address
reversal and if I can decipher anything, but probably someone else will
have to cast the runes...
