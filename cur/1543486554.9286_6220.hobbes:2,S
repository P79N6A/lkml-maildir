This is my first message to the kernel list, so if my problem doesn't
belong here, just tell me and I'll drag my sorry little ass somewhere
else. Please cc any replies to me personally, as I am not subscribed to
the list.
My problem has been reported before. When playing sounds I get the error
Sound: DMA (output) timed out - IRQ/DRQ config error?
I am using a Dell Inspiron 3000 laptop with a Crystal CS4237B sound
controller. I have installed RedHat 5.2 and kernels 2.2.1 and
2.2.1-ac[4,5,6]. I compiled with glibc 2.0.110 and gcc 2.8.1. I have
seen reports of this error occuring with other sound drivers. My
conf.modules file is simply:
alias sound cs4232
options cs4232 io=0x530 irq=5 dma=1 dma2=0
The problem goes away when I boot with pcmcia-cs disabled. I have tried
versions 3.0.8 and 3.0.9. When I do have pcmcia-cs enabled, I can get
sound to work perfectly by rmmod'ing all the sound-related modules after
bootup and then doing modprobe sound or just running a sound app which
autoloads the sound stuff. Perhaps loading pcmcia-cs after sound does
nasty things to sound. I could probably workaround the problem by
removing the sound loading stuff from rc.sysinit and relying on
autoload.
