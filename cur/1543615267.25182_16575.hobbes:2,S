I saw that in the man page for "ps".  I think that your idea makes sense.
However, I'm concerned about searching in "/usr/src/linux" for it.

I knew that I was trying to download the 2.5.x series for a good reason. ;-)
My bandwidth hasn't let me get one full download yet, but I've got
all the 2.4.x patches that I could need.
