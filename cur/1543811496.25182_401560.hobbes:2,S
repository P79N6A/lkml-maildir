Indeed, this only explains why the DMA zone is full.
The floppy driver is asking for a large contiguous chunk of memory
in the DMA zone, which the allocator tries to satistify by killing
applications.
Andrew's patch makes the allocator give up easier, which allows the
driver to fallback to non-contiguous memory (that is the real problem).

There should be no need to prune it to fix the OOM issue, it explains
why the DMA memory is full though.
