Shouldn't be a problem, since we'll have the lock at a time
we actually /do/ something with those pointers.
In deactivate_page_nolock(), all we can modify is the list
in which the page resides, the flags indicating on which
list the page is and the referenced bit + page age. No other
stuff is touched.
Furthermore, the locking order (first pagecache lock, then
the page_list_lock) would make it difficult to do this right...

Rik
