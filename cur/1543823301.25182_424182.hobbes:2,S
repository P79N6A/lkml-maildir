Subject: [PATCH 000 of 3] md: Introduction - 3 bugfixs for -mm
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/5/15/451

The first of these fixes issues with the new bmap based bitmap file
access code, and possibly should be an -mm hotfix, and without it,
'internal' bitmaps don't work any more :-(
Others are minor and unrelated.
Thanks,
NeilBrown
