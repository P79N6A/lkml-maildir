It's pretty hard to say, considering that: (1) None of the code has been 
written yet; (2) It's impossible to say how big a difference new code will 
make just by reading it -- you have to actually test it; and (3) I don't 
have any hardware suitable for testing latencies.
The biggest advantage would come from using a bottom-half handler to do 
most of the work.  Right now the uhci-hcd driver does everything in its 
interrupt handler.  This would certainly help IRQ latency; it might not 
affect application latency very much.
I'll try adding a bottom half in my next series of patches.  Maybe it will 
be ready in time to appear in the -mm kernels before 2.6.12-final is 
released.

We'll see what happens with the upcoming changes.  Maybe you'll be able to 
test them for me?
