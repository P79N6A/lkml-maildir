This is filthy behaviour.
Decent people do not quote private email in a public forum.

    Hmm... you wrote "there was nothing, and I wrote a page."  It matters
    little to me how vfork comes to be documented.  That said, I wonder 
    if some other motive is at play...
    In September, you and I corresponded via email on this very topic.
Yes, and I already apologized for my bad memory (I get several hundred
letters a day, I really do not remember every letter from two months ago)
and I wrote in the text you quote
"In fact, as it turns out, another page was sitting in my inbox."
In fact I merged some of your text, and deleted some parts
that were obviously wrong and sent you the result.
It seems you have no factual comments, only strange insinuations?
