And that is actually what we do, but without paying attention, when
setting up the identity mappings.

The nasty one is if you have a kernel sized just right.  All you get
from the early page tables of allocatable memory is the low 640K.  If
you have PSE disabled (because PAGEALLOC_DEBUG is enabled) up only
have enough pages in the mapping to setup a 256M identity mapping unsing
4K pages ouch.
Another issue is that we have boot_ioremap, and bt_ioremap for different
stages of the boot.  Enabling fixmap early solves that.
Then there is my personal hobby horse.  Using new fangled hardware with
memory mapped I/O registers for debugging.  You need to be able to modify
the page table to use it so you might as well setup the fixmap entries
and then you have something that can be used as long as you care to
leave the hardware enabled.
