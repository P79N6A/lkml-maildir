So how is this question related to either 
1) network development (netdev@oss.sgi.com)
2) linux-kernel development (linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org)
I would like to ask you this question at an apropriate mailinglist
(netfilter@lists.netfilter.org, or the lartc mailinglist [since the
assumption that you would need to do NAT in case you terminate the two
dsl lines is invalid an can be solved using policy routing + connmark]).
