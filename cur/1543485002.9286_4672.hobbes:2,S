Hi,
This question is about the plug_device and unplug_device routines in
lnux/drivers/block/ll_rw_blk.c
1. I cannot find the place where linux fills up the dev->plug structure
apart from the initilizing routine. But in unplug_device routine
dev->plug.next is used. Also in plug device 
dev->current_request =&dev->plug is done.
Where is the contents from dev->plug coming from ?
2. The plug_device is called when there is a request to the device but
dev->current_request is currently empty.(in make request).
However my understanding is that the request is actually attached to the
request queue of the device in add_request routine which is called after 
the task is scheduled. What happens is the dev->req_fn() is called before
add_request can schdule the requests ? Or is this possible ?
3. If some one can explain how the plug_device and the unplug_device works
with the ide disk drives that will be the answer I am looking for. 
Some help on these questions is very much appreciated.
Thanx
Ravi 
***************************************************************************
plug_device and unplug_device fit in as follows
*****************************************************************************
The initialising is done here
blk_dev_init()
 {
   .....
   
   for (dev = blk_dev + MAX_BLKDEV; dev-- != blk_dev;) {                           
                dev->request_fn      = NULL;                                            
                dev->current_request = NULL;                                            
                dev->plug.rq_status  = RQ_INACTIVE;                                     
                dev->plug.cmd        = -1;                                              
                dev->plug.next       = NULL;                                            
                dev->plug_tq.routine = &unplug_device;                                  
                dev->plug_tq.data    = dev;                                             
        }          
    .......
}
The calling is done in 
static void make_request(int major,int rw, struct buffer_head * bh)
{
  ......
   req = blk_dev[major].current_request;
   if (!req) {                                                                     
                /* MD and loop can't handle plugging without deadlocking
*/             
                if (major != MD_MAJOR && major != LOOP_MAJOR)                           
                        plug_device(blk_dev + major);                                   
        } else switch (major) {             
 
        .............
}
and the two routines are as follows
static inline void plug_device(struct blk_dev_struct * dev)                             
{                                                                                       
        dev->current_request = &dev->plug;                                              
        queue_task_irq_off(&dev->plug_tq, &tq_disk);                                    
}  
void unplug_device(void * data)                                                         
{                                                                                       
        struct blk_dev_struct * dev = (struct blk_dev_struct *) data;                   
        unsigned long flags;                                                            
                                                                                        
        save_flags(flags);                                                              
        cli();                                                                          
        if (dev->current_request == &dev->plug) {                                       
                struct request * next = dev->plug.next;                                 
                dev->current_request = next;                                            
                if (next) {                                                             
                        dev->plug.next = NULL;                                          
                        (dev->request_fn)();                                            
                }                                                                       
        }                                                                               
        restore_flags(flags);
