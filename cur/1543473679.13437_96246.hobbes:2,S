Hey all,
Just wanted to send out a quick update:  I upgraded a number of machines to 
2.1.132ac3, and the corruption problems I reported earlier this month haven't 
occured since.
I'm going to upgrade everyone to 2.2.0pre2 and see if that works as well.
Thanks all, this was a major pain to work with.
