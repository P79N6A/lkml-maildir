Hi,
I agree with you, the order of the initialization should not be changed 
by some config options. Either it works, or it doesn't! So the question 
now is : "is fine to move populate_rootfs() earlier?"
Some data points:
* It used to be called earlier. It was moved to be called later about a 
year ago by Linus (8d610dd52dd1da696e199e4b4545f33a2a5de5c6) with this log:

So there must be some good reasons to keep it late enough...
* This patch is used in SuSE, and it seems noone has ever had a problem 
with the initramfs early init.
I guess the problem that Linus solved by moving populate_rootfs() 
happens only rarely or on only few configurations. Linus, do you 
remember what kind of problem it was? How can I reproduce it?
One different solution that I implemented [1] was to have an 
"early_populate_rootfs()" before the acpi_early_init(), leaving 
populate_rootfs() at the normal place. If the early version fails, it's 
ok: we can't override the DSDT, but the later version will work as usual 
anyway. This solution also seems to work quite often (it's used in 
Ubuntu, Mandriva and PCLinuxOS)
Would that seem an acceptable solution? Or what other way exists?

Christoph, if you have seen this part of the code, you have probably 
also read the big fat warning explaining why this cannot be done by 
firmware loader (ie: userspace cannot be run at this early time, 
corresponding to acpi_early_init()). However, you probably know the 
kernel ten times better than me. Could you explain what I misunderstood 
when writing this warning, and give me some hints about how to use the 
firmware loader in this case?
See you,
Eric
