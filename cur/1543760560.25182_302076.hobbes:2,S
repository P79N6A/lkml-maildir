Will split it up and resend.

The standard PCI Specification calls out SERR and PERR. I am not sure
about the recent discussion of PCI error of recovery. It is perhaps
regarding the possibility of recovering from a PERR or SERR. However,
PCI Express error occurs on the PCI Express link or on behalf of
transactions occurred on the PCI Express link. PCI Express component,
which implements PCI Express Advanced Error Reporting Capability, sends
error message to the Root Port to indicate error occurred on the PCI
Express link where it is connected. The PCI Express error recovery is on
behalf of attempting to do a PCI Express link recovery, not PCI error
recovery. It appears that PCI Express AER is disjoint from PCI error
recovery.
Thanks,
