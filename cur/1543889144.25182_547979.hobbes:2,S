That's because the whole premise of your benchmark relies on a workload that 
yield()s itself to the eyeballs on most graphic card combinations when using 
glxgears. Your test remains a test of sched_yield in the presence of your 
workloads rather than anything else. If people like ck2 it's because in the 
real world with real workloads it is better, rather than on a yield() based 
benchmark. Repeatedly the reports are that 3d apps and games in normal usage 
under -ck are better than mainline and cfs.
