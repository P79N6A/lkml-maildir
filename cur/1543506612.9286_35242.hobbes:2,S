I've been thinking about the huge ISDN patch for a few weeks now. 
I agree completely with Linus that huge patches should not be accepted at
feature freeze time. As Linus has pointed out, they cannot be properly
reviewed in the short time before the kernel is declared "stable". On the
other hand, the work that the ISDN developers have done should make it
into the tree. Asking them to submit small patches has been futile in the
past and I don't see any reason to believe this will change. 
I believe the best time to roll in the huge ISDN patch would be 2.5.1.
This allows the most time for peer review before it makes it into a
"stable" kernel. Users who need it sooner can continue to apply the patch
themselves, as they do now.
Adding a huge patch now to 2.3 risks delaying 2.4. It also jeopardizes the
stability of 2.4. Either of these suffice, IMO, to justify postponing a   
huge patch updating feature that is used by relatively few people (most of
whom probably compile their own kernels) until 2.5.1.
