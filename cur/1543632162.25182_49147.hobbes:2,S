   Precisely what happened is easiest to trace with the identify data in hand.
   For example, maybe the sparc code still has to be extended to fix the
   order of lba_capacity48 or so (in ide_fix_driveid).
Almost certainly this is the problem.  I am looking
at it.   
   BTW, this fixing in-place of the driveid is a very bad idea.
   Nobody should ever touch driveid. It is a read-only variable.
Well, you are probably right.  Currently it is defined as read-only
after ide_fix_driveid() runs on it :-)
