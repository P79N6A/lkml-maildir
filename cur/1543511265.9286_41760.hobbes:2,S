this is just a reminder: IDE requires that your cable is <= 18",
and that you use the end connectors first (no stubs).
udma66 also requires a special cable with extra ground conductors
(these cables work fine for sub-udma66 as well).
from a quick glance at the code, this message seems to originate in
ide_dma.c:ide_dma_intr, as the result of _any_ bad CRC.  occasional bad CRC's 
are not really a problem, and the IO will be retried.
regards, mark hahn.
