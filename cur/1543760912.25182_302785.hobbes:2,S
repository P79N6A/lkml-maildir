bus_to_virt returns void *.
adpt_isr casts the return value to ulong though and adpt_i2o_to_scsi
takes an ulong as its first argument and passes it to readl without a
cast then.
But I agree, the patch just silences the compiler warning. Maybe it
would be a better solution to change the types of reply and msg in
adpt_isr as well as the first argument to adpt_i2o_to_scsi to void
__iomem *.
