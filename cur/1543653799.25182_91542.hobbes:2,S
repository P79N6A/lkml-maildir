Not at all.  That was the point of me entire email, that the LVM code 
should handle these types of shuffles of space and simply use md modules 
as the underlying mapper technology.  Then, you go to one place to both 
specify how things are laid out and what mapping is used in those laid out 
spaces.  Basically, I'm saying how I think things *should* be, and you're 
telling me how they *are*.  I know this, and I'm saying how things *are* 
is wrong.  There *should* be no md superblocks, there should only be dm 
superblocks on LVM physical devices and those DM superblocks should 
include the data needed to fire up the proper md module on the proper 
physical extents based upon what mapper technology is specified in the 
DM superblock and what layout is specified in the DM superblock.  In my 
opinion, the existence of both an MD and DM driver is wrong because they 
are inherently two sides of the same coin, logical device mapping support, 
with one being better at putting physical disks into intelligent arrays 
and one being better at mapping different logical volumes onto one or more 
physical volume groups.
