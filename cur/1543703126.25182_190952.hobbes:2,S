Guys, do you remember my acpi-perflib?[1] Currently, I'm rewriting it so that
it isn't so invasive and can be merged more easily during 2.x.[2] It's exactly
what you want as base for powernow-k7-acpi and powernow-k8-acpi driver.
However, as it relies on CONFIG_ACPI, an acpi-perflib-no-acpi module which
exports the same functions, but includes a minimal parser could be added.
But let's do the easy part (CONFIG_ACPI) first.

[patches are taken down from the website, though...]
[2] http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=acpi4linux&m=107398568612489&w=2 is a
first step, another one will be sent out later today.
