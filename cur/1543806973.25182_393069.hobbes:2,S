We found a workaround for the OOM problems on above server yesterday.  
Add a 1MiB swap file:
dd if=/dev/zero of=/var/swapfile bs=1024 count=1024
mkswap /var/swapfile
swapon /var/swapfile
Run backup script and no problems!
Note: This is a suse SLES9 system and the problem is not present on
kernel kernel-smp-2.6.5-7.193.i586.rpm and all earlier kernels and it is
present on kernel-smp-2.6.5-7.201.i586.rpm and all later kernels
including the latest kernel (2.6.5-7.244).
Seems like a definite VM bug...  Interestingly on the .244 kernel the
OOM conditions print out a lot of debug information to dmesg about the
memory use in the system and AFAICS none of the memory is exhausted!  So
it seems the system goes OOM without it actually being OOM because it
detects that "free swap == 0" or something along those lines...
Or do we nowadays require swap to be present?
The machine has 6GiB RAM so swap was turned off on it.  (In our
experience if a machine with a lot of concurrent connections starts
swapping the system goes down the drain (it becomes too slow) so swap is
not something we want on servers with 40000+ users...)
If the above is not enough information to find/fix the problem please
let me know what more you would like to know...
Best regards,
        Anton
