Using kswapd is easy, but doesn't always work well.  The patch
contains the code to ignore page accessed bits when kswapd is run on
disabled zones, but that's not enough for swapping out frequently used
pages.
In my patch, page copying, or "remapping", solves this problem by
blocking accesses to the page under operation.
