Let's put this straight: it has not been my primary goal to clean it up.
I have posted an alternative implementation. One of the good things about the
alternative implementation is lines-of-savings through code sharing.
Don't hear me say my code is perfect. As anybody else here I am relying on
reviews and feedback in order to make it good enough.
I think there has been enough duplication to consider a component
that statistics data is handed over to.
