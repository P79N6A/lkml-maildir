You mis-understand.
PF_DEAD has _always_ been about the task state, in a very serious way. It 
didn't "slip into" it. It always was very much about it.
The problem is that we touch "task->state" in a _lot_ of places: for 
example, when we take a page fault, we have to clear it, because we can't 
just run with some random task state (see top of __handle_mm_fault). 
PF_DEAD was a "safe haven". It's somewhere that we _don't_ modify the word 
in many places, so it doesn't get lost, and we can do sanity checking (ie 
we can have things like "BUG_ON(tsk->flags & PF_DEAD)" to make sure that 
the task really is valid in a few places. 
Now, arguably the task struct handling is solid enough that maybe we don't 
need this any more. But this is what it was all about: it was hidden away 
in a non-obvious place exactly _because_ we wanted it hidden away 
somewhere where the normal ops wouldn't ever touch it.
