Subject: [-mm PATCH] EDAC: make Kconfig defaults match recommendations in help text
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/12/11/38

"config EDAC" and "config EDAC_MM_EDAC" both state clearly that if the user
is unsure she should select "Y", yet the default for those options is "N".
This patch brings the default for the options into line with the
recommendation stated in the help text.
Please consider for inclusion.

 	  Some systems are able to detect and correct errors in main
