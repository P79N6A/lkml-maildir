I really agree with the way you think the fix should be. I didn't take
this approach, since I just wished to fix a bug and not the architecture
of original and current parents you built. Since now you clearly state
that this was not the right approach, then I feel more comfortable to
fix it is a cleaner way. Unfortunately, I am somewhat busy until end of
February, and I don't think that the patch will be ready before (testing
take sometimes more time than developing ;-). If you can wait until, then
I will resend a better fix then.
