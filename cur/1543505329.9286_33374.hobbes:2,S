	It's doesn't give oops info.  At least, not when I get
the panic, all you get is two lines:
                Kernel Panic: scsi_free:Trying to free unused memory
                In interrupt handler - not syncing
	And that's it, system hung, time to hit 'reset'.  I have
managed to get alt-sysreq to work once, but it didn't actually do anything,
it claimed it was going to do something, but never came back, and
alt-sysreq-b didn't do anything, so got to hit the reset button and
wait a long time. :)
