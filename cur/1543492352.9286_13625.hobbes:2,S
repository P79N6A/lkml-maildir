NFS is insecure because there is no guaranteed user id mapping or access
control. As soon as I can plug in a system on the local LAN I do have access.
You don´t need the big bad internet for NFS security problems, there are enough
inhouse. Most companies I deal with have policies to not use it or at least
disallow sensitive data on NFS.
