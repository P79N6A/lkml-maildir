Yup. Or rather, he suggested 4M (0x400000):
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/2/23/189
Aligning the kernel image on 4M could gain an additional TLB entry if the 
kernel image would fit in one (4M aligned) hugepage, but not in the 3M 
that's left after loading the kernel at 1M physical. And that stuff about 
the MTRRs...
That 0x1000000 (16M) is another potentially interesting value on machines 
with enough memory as it gets the kernel image out of the old ZONE_DMA.

I've been loading the kernel at 16M physical for ages now on x86. No 
problems either.
