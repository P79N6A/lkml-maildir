In 2.6.1-rc1-mm1, KGDB fails to generate breakpoints after the
initial one, in either built-in code or in modules.
I started the debug session as usual w
  gdb vmlinux
The target then halts as expected in bootup
  target remote /dev/ttyS0
  c
causes boot to continue as expects
However, once running, the gdb break command against
the running kernel or a loaded module fails to result in a break.
The module start address was set as usual w add-symbol-file
which in turn matches   cat /proc/modules.
I'll debug this myself if need be, but hopefully
there is some simple solution?
Thnx much,
johnh
