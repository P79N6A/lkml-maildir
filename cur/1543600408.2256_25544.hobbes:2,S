The SMTP RFC requires that user@[ip.address] is correctly recognized
as a final destination.  This requires that Linux provides the MTA
with information about IP addresses that correspond with INADDR_ANY.
I am susprised that it is not possible to ask such information up
front (same with netmasks), and that an application has to actually
query a complex oracle, again and again, for every IP address.
