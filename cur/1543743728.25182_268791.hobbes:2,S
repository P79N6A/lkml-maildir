What you do with the GPL _on_your_computer_ is not relevant.  libc is a
standard interface, which is used by many programs, much the same way
that a keyboard is a standard interface to a computer.  You don't see
companies with copyright to _all_ keyboards, do you? ;-D

This, of course, would assume that said code is compiled as a module. I
posted earlier some available makefile snippets from the code that they
_do_ distribute that shows they do _not_ link it as a module, but 
directly
into the kernel.  Last I saw, NVidia couldn't distribute kernels with 
their
modules compiled directly into the binary.
