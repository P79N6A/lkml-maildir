So I guess we're going to go with Jan's change then.
I just wanted to discuss this briefly since I'm very keen for the kernel 
not to enforce legal/DRM type policy at all - this isn't quite the same 
discussion as we've had previously but the point remains: it should be 
for people to realize when they are violating a license as software 
unfortunately cannot ever be intelligent to catch all the baddies.
Personally, I am less worried if people use an obvious "PROPRIETARY" 
label because they're at least admitting and saying it how it is - then 
if later it can be shown that they are in fact violating kernel 
copyright, they've helped to sign their own death warrant :-)
Jon.
