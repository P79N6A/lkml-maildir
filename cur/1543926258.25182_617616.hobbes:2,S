Maybe not a bad idea, though I'm not the one to ask about taste ;)
In this case, it is enough for your requests to be a set of scalars
(eg. file offsets), so it _could_ be handled with vectorised offsets...
But in general, for special files, I guess the response is usually
some structured data (that is not visible at the syscall layer).
So I don't see a big problem to have a similarly arbitrarily
structured request.

That's true too.
