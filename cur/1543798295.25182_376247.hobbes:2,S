Not at all.
Doing a s/down/lock_mutex/ s/up/unlock_mutex/ - or whatever naming
convention we want to use - all over the place for mutexes while keeping
the up/down for counting semaphores is an one time issue.
After the conversion every code breaks at compile time which tries to do
up/down(mutex_type).
So the out of tree drivers have a clear indication what to fix. This is
also a one time issue.
So where is the problem - except for fixing "huge" amounts of out of
kernel code once ?
