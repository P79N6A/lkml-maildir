Errr... Yeah, I guess I'll take your word for it, because I can't
follow that code at all 8(.  I see that try_to_swap_out() does an
unlock without a lock anywhere in sight, but I can't see the path
between this and swap_out_mm().
Please: am I too stupid to understand this, or is the code a
convoluted mess?
Must be this warm English beer,
Rusty.
