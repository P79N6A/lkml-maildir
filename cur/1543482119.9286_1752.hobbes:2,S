Thank you for the initiative.
There is one known problem with the patch - after a longer
time (and possibly triggered by some more or less
probable circumstances) the Netscape stops accepting
keystrokes and clicks on the links. The only
possibility is to exit and then the browser
is not ended correctly - it leaves lock file
behind etc.
So I wouldn't recommend this patch as a general
solution (nor do I plan to further do the
detective work - my primary goal was to isolate
the problem and the patch is actually
a side-effect :-)).
If you want to include it, I have no problem
with it, but please, advise the users that although
it can help, they are known problems and they
must decide, what is better (for me the benefit
is better than the problems, for others this
can vary). It should not be a default.
I have sent the bug report with the analysis
to Netscape - I hope that the problem will be
corrected in the next version (will there be
any of the 4.x serie?).
The thread became off-topic for linux-kernel - is
there some netscape users mailing list?
