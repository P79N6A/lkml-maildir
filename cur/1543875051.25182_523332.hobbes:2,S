Ingo, 
I had seen it before, and I had no objections under the premise, that it
does not break things and especially survives on Andrews VAIO. I
expected that to come in via -mm so it gets enough testing.
We should revert that patch and add a "trust_lapic_timer_in_c2"
commandline option instead. So we are on the safe side.
