Right.

If the interactive task uses all it's timeslice, then it's not really
very interactive, it's chewing quite a bit of CPU ... presumably in
the common case, these things don't finish their timeslices. I thought
we preempted the running task when a higher prio one woke up, so this
should still work, right?
So it would seem to make sense to boost the prio of a interactive task 
*without* increasing the size of it's timeslice.

That at least makes sense. AFIAK at least the early versions of Con's
stuff make cpu bound jobs' timeslices short even if there were no
interactive jobs. I don't like that (or more relevantly, the benchmarks
don't either ;-)).

If it works in practice, it works, I guess. I just don't see why X
is super special ... are we going to have to renice *all* interactive 
tasks in order to get things to work properly?
