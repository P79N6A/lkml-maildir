I have tried to use cdrecord with any of the new kernels, with no luck. I can
start up the cdrecord process, and it looks like it is going to work, but then
the load starts to increase up to 30 or so...making my machine useless. I am
using Suse 6.0 with a memorex 1622 updated to firmware 4.0. I have  a 200 amd
k6 with 80 mb of ram. the drive is running under ide-scsi. Any thoughts?
