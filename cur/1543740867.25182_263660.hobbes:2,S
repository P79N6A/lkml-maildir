Hi,
I have been looking at sunkbd.c and it seems that it attaches not only to
ports that speak SUNKBD protocol but also to ports that do not specify any
protocol:
	if ((serio->type & SERIO_PROTO) && (serio->type & SERIO_PROTO) != SERIO_SUNKBD)
		return;
Was that an oversight or it was done intentionally?
Thanks!
