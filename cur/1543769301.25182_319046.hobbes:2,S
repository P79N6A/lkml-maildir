Subject: [PATCH 9/9] UML - Change printf to printk in console driver
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/5/18/13

From Al Viro - we have error messages with KERN_ERR in them, so they
should be printk-ed rather than printf-ed.
