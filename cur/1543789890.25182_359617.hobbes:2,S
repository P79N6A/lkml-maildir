you can implement a char device using the block layer.  See
drivers/scsi/{ch.c,osst.c,sg.c,st.c} for examples.
That beeing said I tried this approach.  It looks pretty cool when you
think about it, but the block layer is quite a bit too heavyweight for
queueing up a few SMP requests, and we need to carry too much useless
code around for it.
