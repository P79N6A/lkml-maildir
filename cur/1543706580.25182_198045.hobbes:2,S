Subject: [PATCH] __release_region() race

Hi,
I am testing PCI hot-plug in 2.6.2 kernel, but sometimes
a struct resource tree in kernel/resource.c was broken
if multiple hot-plug requests are issued at the same time.
The reason is lots of drivers call release_region() on hot removal,
and __release_region(), which is invoked by release_region() macro,
changes the tree without holding a writer lock for resource_lock.
I think __release_region() must hold a writer lock as well as
__request_region() does.
A following patch fixes the issue in my environment.
Regards,
Naoaki Maeda
