I HAD a Asus K7M with a 650 MHz Athlon, 256 MB RAM (Infineon, Ram is OK).
Using 2.4.2 AND 2.4.4 didn't work.
Whenever i started KDE2, the crashes startet, even oopses in ext2-code appeared.
The strange thing is : If i startet KDE2 as root, the crashes didn't happen!
I don't know why, my distribution is RedHat 7.1
Now i have a Epox 8kta3+ with an 1,333 MHz Athlon, FSB266, 256 MB RAM (Infineon)
and the crashes still appear.
Changing the Kernel from Athlon to Pentium-II/III makes the system stable again.
