Is there a good reason for id_mask/subsystem_mask to exist at all?
Although the in-driver tables must be changed, it seems much more
logical and simple to split the 'struct match_info' into vendor/device
id pairs and eliminate *_mask.
With that change,
o the number of match_info members stays the same
o the structure gets smaller (4 * u16 instead of 4 * u32)
o you can use constants from pci.h instead of having a literal hex
constant in the code
o there is absolutely NO confusion as to where the vendor/device ids are
placed in the structure
And a fifth item:  from length of this thread, it is also obvious that
the current pci_scan method is error prone.  Using vendor/device id
pairs is what the normal pci_find_xxx functions use... why not continue
to walk down that path?
Regards,
