Not sure if I follow... Generally speaking open is not a mandatory
operation; however every object in driver model has a release method.
What I am saying is that certain drivers need to have their disconnect
method split in 2 parts - one that shuts down the device and second is
releases resources that might be accesses through sysfs (and other
kernel parts). That second part will have to be called from
subsystem's core ->release() method se we need a release() hook.
