I wanted to have a "this changes nothing" patch first. Cleanups in
front would be trickier to do because period of "settle down" is
needed before split. We now had quite a long "settle down" period, so
I've seen opportunity to do the split now.

Nothing we could not handle. Kernel needs to use get_user, while
userspace needs to seek/read/write on /dev/kmem (when accessing "the
other" addresses).

I thought about that -- user/kernel interface would certainly be nicer
-- but I do not think it is feasible without writing a lot of code. 
[I agree that assymetry I have in there is ugly, but I don't see a way
to do alloc_pagedir() in userspace, and I'd like to keep page
relocation in userspace.]

We may have to move function or two, but I think nothing too dramatic
will happen.
