Nope. x++ increments x sometime (not defined when) after taking the value. 
   x = x++ % y
is wrong: There is just one sequence point at the end of the expression,
and x is modified twice in between (++ and =). If this gives the same as:
   x = (x + 1) % y
gcc is smoking potent stuff... but it could legally do anything at all.
