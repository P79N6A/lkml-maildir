Any mapping structure will have to be pre-allocated.

So in my secret heart of hearts, I do indeed hope that cnodes are rare
enough that we don't actually have to do anything smart to make them
go fast.  Either having no fast lookup structure or creating it in
memory as needed would be the nicest solution.  However, since I can't
guarantee this will be the case, it's nice to have some idea of what
we'll do if this does become important.

Yep.  It's much better to optimize away most cnodes instead of trying
to make the go fast.
