Hi all,
Just noticed the above message in my kernel log on my machine running  
2.6.16-rc2-ide2. I know there's a 2.6.16-rc4 now... I'm waiting to  
upgrade until Alan comes up with new -ide patches or ATAPI over  
libata/PATA starts working in -mm.
On another machine I also get:
Driver 'via686a' needs updating - please use bus_type methods
HTH,
Chris
