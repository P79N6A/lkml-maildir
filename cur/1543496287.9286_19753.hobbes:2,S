D'oh, serves me right for replying whilst hung-over :) I looked at your
original message again and I don't think I understand what your problem is.
alias block-major-8 sd_mod will load sd_mod when your scsi disks are accessed;
sd_mod will then request "scsi_hostadapter", which should be aliased to ppa.
Of course, I assume this doesn't work if you have more than one scsi adapter,
but that doesn't seem to be what you're asking.
I can't see a situation in which the feature you asked for would be useful
at the moment, but I'm prepared to be corrected. At any rate, it would be
something to be done in modutils rather than the kernel itself.
