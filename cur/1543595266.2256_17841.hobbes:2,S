The trick if you want a good GUI environment in 32Mb is to run something like
XFce (www.xfce.org). My 32Mb test/devel box I use to prove stuff still works
sanely on non obscene computers is very happy with XFce and with BrowseX as
the web browser.
That is mostly not a kernel problem.  With XFce 3.8.3 the 32Mb box flies,
and its happy doing stuff like web browsing while playing dvd movies with the
Creative DXR2 overlay card, even though its only a Cyrix MII 233
