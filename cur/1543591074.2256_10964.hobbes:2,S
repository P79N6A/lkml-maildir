The lack of coherency would screw this up anyway, doesn't it?
You have a block device, soon to be in the page cache, and
a superblock, also soon to be in the page cache. LILO writes to
the block device, while the ext2 driver updates the superblock.
Whatever gets written out last wins, and the other is lost.
