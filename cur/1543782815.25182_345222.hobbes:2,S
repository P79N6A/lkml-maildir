Thank you so very much for this. This is indeed a quite valuable
resource and being able to download via bittorrent is sometimes faster
for some people and the fact that we can also contribute with a little
bandwidth for other people just gives the feeling of giving something
back to the community.
Thanks for the pointer, Rogério.
