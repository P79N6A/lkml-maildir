Highlights for version 0.2.2
v0.2.2 - 11/04/01
- Support for Devfs
   - If devfs is enabled in the kernel, all necessary device files for
      discovered volumes will appear at boot time in /dev/evms.
   - Updated code in engine for creating device files in the case when devfs
      is not enabled.
- Dual on-disk copies of EVMS-native metadata (system data and
   feature headers)
   - Kernel and engine common code responsible for recognizing and reconciling
      the redundant copies of system data and feature headers
   - Individual plugins responsible for maintaining multiple copies of
      their private metadata.
- LVM plugin
   - Creating snapshot LVs and contiguous LVs, and deleting snapshot LVs.
   - All metadata is now read/written in endian-neutral format
   - Improved option handling and information displays.
- Default Segment Manager plugin
   - Fixed a bug with removing the last segment from a disk.
   - When assigning the segment manager to a new disk, it now adds OS/2 boot
      sector code to the MBR.
- Drivelinking and BBR engine plugins now commit using the new
   dual-metadata format.
   - BBR discovery works, but there is a known I/O bug when running mkfs on
      a BBR volume.
- OS/2 Region Manager
   - Kernel and engine discovery of OS/2 compatibility volumes
   - Kernel discovery of OS/2 LVM volumes
- Fixed kernel-side volume quiesce/rediscover bug
- Modifed kernel patching process
   - EVMS package now comes with several small patches specific to particular
      2.4 kernel versions for patching the common files modified by EVMS.
   - See the EVMS-HOWTO for more details.
