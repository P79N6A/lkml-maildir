I'm not sure that I, personally, am a realtime device anyway ;-)
In the context of an mp3 playback system, worrying about whether the
controls are realtime seems a little excessive.  But it's not too hard to
do.  Just allow the RTOS to take control of the input devices, or at least
to insert itself ahead of the general purpose operating system in the
interrupt pipeline.
As for a GUI with realtime response characteristics, that's more
challenging, but it has been done.  It's also less important I'd say.  You
can always fall back on dedicated hardware for the realtime display.
Such concerns become very practical matters when you get into the world of
industrial control systems.

I think that depends on whether you are an audiophile or not.  Or a
broadcaster.  If you're a broadcaster, how many mp3 skips will you tolerate
a year?  By way of analogy, if you're a network administrator, how many
unplanned reboots will you tolerate a year, if you know that by merely
changing the software, you will have none?  There's something to be said
for reliability that is *provable*.
And who said anything about throwing away most of Unix?
