The whole point was that he was doing extra copies and mount/unmounts that he
didn't need.   He couldn't just mount it in /etc/ in the first place because he
needed to copy stuff from the underlying fs that was there onto the tmpfs.

Which is why I proposed two mounts:
(1) A mount under /dev/shm reflecting its nature and role as providing posix
shared mem (convenient because its not /etc where he already _has_ files)
(2) A bind mount under /etc reflecting its nature and role as providing a
ram-based file system (convenient because that's where he actually wants the fs
to be)
I just suggested that by mounting it what has been established as the canonical
place for mounting tmpfs and using a bind mount he doesn't need the extra
copies/mounts.
Sheesh.  Next thing you'll be asking if a filesystem can have buddha nature.
