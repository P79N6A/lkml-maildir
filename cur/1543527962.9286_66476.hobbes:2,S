Nothing. 
It is a vendor app problem.

The more interesting thing is what exactly happened in your case.
Unfortunately Jeff Merkey did "The Jeff thing (TM)" (i.e. distracting the entire
list with what Caldera/RedHat/etc does/does not do to solve his problems). So
the following stands open:
1. I think it is not just rwhod, any broadcast would have done the same.
2. What network setup caused NT respond to a foreign IP interface broadcast and
should we accomodate for this (i.e. NO shared setup like having different
subnets share same media). 
3. Linux treated the broadcasts as invalid. Your initial posts correspond to :
        /*
         *      Check the other end isnt violating RFC 1122. Some routers send
         *      bogus responses to broadcast frames. If you see this message
         *      first check your netmask matches at both ends, if it does then
         *      get the other vendor to fix their kit.
         */
in /usr/src/linux/net/ipv4/icmp.c
Is it a setup problem or something which should/must be blamed on M$. 
Cheers ;-)
