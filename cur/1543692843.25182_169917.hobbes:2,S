My recent experience in patch submission makes me believe that sending
patches to the kernel maintainers is like sending the patch into a vacuum.
I don't care to maintain any of the drivers with my name on them anymore
partly because of such problems.  I imagine if you keep posting the patch
to the list it will someday reach kernel.org, since apparently being the
author of a driver doesn't mean your patches will be applied nowdays.
good luck! :)
