I'm not waiting. :)
I'm making a cross-compiler for ARM (by hand, figuring out how to do it), and 
I have a whole weekend to thump on it.  I want to build a kernel, uClibc, and 
busybox, and get them to boot under qemu-system-arm.  That will be the "ok, 
declare victory and document what I just did" moment.
I'll let you know what breaks.  (I have Mazur's old 2.6.12 here for 
comparison, so I may even have patches.  You never know... :)
