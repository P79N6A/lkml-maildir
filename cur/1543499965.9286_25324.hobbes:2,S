Look, we've been over this before. This is not the _real_, but the _only_
reason why you would need to have matching kernel headers. And it's
easily fixable.
But this doesn't belong on linux-kernel, I think. Unless someone could
comment on the feasibility of moving /usr/src/linux/include/net to
/usr/src/linux/include/linux/net, which _is_ on-topic and would solve
the problem of compiling with -I/usr/src/linux/include quite nicely.
Mike.
