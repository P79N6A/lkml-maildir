making a patch means you've modfied the source which you are not allowed
to do. The most you can do is report the bug through normal channels
(you dont even have priority in reporting bugs since you have the code).
at least _ANYONE_ was able to contribute to linux. not just people with
gobs of money. I'm not even gonna comment on the embarrasement bit. The
one consultant quoted in the article summed it pretty nicely.
Also notice that you're now paying MS so you can find their bugs. Very
nice.
