The 3 clause BSD though very much a completely free/open license has
requirements conflicting with the GPL 
http://www.fsf.org/licenses/license-list.html#GPLIncompatibleLicenses
http://www.fsf.org/philosophy/bsd.html
An additional problem with a BSD like license is that it makes no
statement on patents - regrettably a critical issue now days in the
USSA. That means nothing prevents CITI from providing BSD licensed code
and then 6 months later sueing everyone who used it. I don't see CITI
doing that but the basic problem is still there.
If it is all their own code, and they want to have a BSD licensed copy
for other reasons - eg to merge the same code into BSD, sell it to
proprietary vendors or whatever, then it would be immensely saner if
they would submit a copy for the Linux kernel under the GPL and keep it
dual licensed. As the owner of a work they can license it many many ways
all at the same time.
The random driver has a nice example of this.
