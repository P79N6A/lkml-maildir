Subject: [PATCH] 32-bit UID support for 2.3.27 (updated)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi. Yet another updated version of the 32-bit UID support patch is now
available. This one includes support for 32-bit UIDs in the real-time
signals, thereby including 32-bit UID support in all possible parts of the
kernel.
The patches are available at:
http://www.engin.umich.edu/caen/systems/Linux/code/misc/2.3/19991112/
Changes in this version:
	- support 32-bit UIDs in the real-time signals' siginfo
	  structures, keeping backwards compatibility with the old 16-bit
	  UID fields
	- support 32-bit UIDs in siginfo for all architectures
	- tested on final 2.3.27 kernel
	- eliminate yet more superfluous comments, making the patch even
	  smaller
	- split off the process accounting patch into a separate patch
To summarize the contents of the different patches:
http://www.engin.umich.edu/caen/systems/Linux/code/misc/2.3/19991112/
linux-arch-independ.patch
	- the core 32-bit UID patch; doesn't do anything unless your
	  architecture defines UID16_COMPAT_NEEDED
linux-acct.patch
	- support 32-bit UIDs in the process accounting record
linux-ipc.patch
	- support 32-bit UIDs in msgctl(), semctl(), and shmctl()
linux-ext2.patch
	- support 32-bit UIDs in the ext2 filesystem, using the same
	  on-disk inode layout as the HURD
	  (fully compatible with existing ext2 filesystems)
linux-filesystems.patch
	- support 32-bit UIDs on udf and ufs filesystems
	- fix up minix, qnx4, and sysv filesystems to not write out the
	  low 16 bits of a UID > 65535
linux-arm.patch
linux-i386.patch
linux-m68k.patch
linux-sh.patch
linux-sparc.patch
	- patches to enable the use of 32-bit UIDs on an
	  architecture-by-architecture basis
linux-other-arch.patch
	- needed to define the uid16_t and gid16_t types on architectures
	  that already support 32-bit UIDs. (these types are used when
	  dealing with filesystems that only support 16-bit UIDs)
Thanks,
