sysfs is a filesystem used to export the device model (a tree of data
structures representing the devices in a system) to user-space in a
clean and efficient way.
procfs is a more generic (and less elegant) filesystem for exporting
anything to user-space.
sysfs only replaces procfs in so far as relevant interfaces, such as
those related to hardware.  process information should remain in procfs.
/proc is not going anywhere.
