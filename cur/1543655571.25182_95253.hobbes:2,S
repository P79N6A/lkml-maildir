That's a known fact, however I experienced Linux to perform the best in 
such worst case situations among several other Unices I tested, and NAPI 
certainly has brought some improvements in this area.

I'm afraid but I don't understand what you mean with the second part of 
your statement.

Huh? Routing performance improvements? Routing is almost possible at 
wire speed. Some 60us delay per packet maybe (in case of load balancing 
decisions) but what do you want to improve?
I agree with you that netfilter NAT performance should and possibly can 
be impoved. And people are working on proof-of-concept improvements of 
NAPT in the Linux kernel including the netfilter team. But again, for me 
the hidden patch (
http://www.ssi.bg/~ja/hidden-2.4.20pre10-1.diff
) as it 
can be found does nothing to improve your situation.

I doubt this would help much but I haven't tested it and I do not see 
all consequences on the routing, the routing cache and the FIB policy of 
modifying HZ. I couldn't comment on that.

Now that certainly is interesting, does he have any nice numbers to back 
this up? I'd be very interested. Also I've cc'd Jamal (I hope he will 
forgive me for that) who's working in this field since a couple of years 
now. Maybe he can comment on the HZ changes.
