Hi Satyam,

I think that the above line should change from "echo eth2 > dev_name" to 
"echo -n eth2 > dev_name" or the newline should be removed at store_dev_name().
The default behavior of echo(1) outputs the newline. 
So, if we write appropriate network device name to dev_name, 
the netpoll can't find net_device in netpoll_setup(). 
I don't have enough time now. So I will check your patches more specific 
at the weekend.
Thanks
