Well, we're unable to build drivers/scsi/53c7,8xx.c and the two ARM files,
the others just get included, so don't affect the build. 53c7,8xxx is 
broken by BIO changes, so nobody but ARM is affected currently.

There's three way around the limitation of "-Wp" to pass arguments 
containing commas to cpp:
o Use the environment variable SUNPRO_DEPENDENCIES instead or
o Invoke cpp directly or
o Rename the generated temporary .d file by substituting ',' with
  something else.

It would in general be saner to generally disallow source file names with 
a ',' in them. Not so much for the build system, but also for the other 
cases where we can't handle them, like e.g. KBUILD_BASENAME as used in 
include/linux/spinlock.h, or in Rusty's work, which will allow to pass
parameters to built-in modules on the kernel command line, like
<module name>.<parm>=<value>.
