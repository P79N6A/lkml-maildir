minor correction - actually, as this is 686 code, it does. (i remember
playing with this too, and mingo _is_ right - it comes out slower anyway
(depending on aligment etc). Actually it's even more interesting --
you can time the difference when using different registers as testl
arguments (the testl only has to clear CF so you can just pick one))
