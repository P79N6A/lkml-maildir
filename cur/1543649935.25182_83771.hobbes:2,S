Certainly.   That however does not imply that Robert's patch should read 
"number of threads" instead of "number of siblings."  The lone word 
"thread" does not automatically imply "active thread running on this 
virtual processor" or anything close to that.
"sibling" makes a lot more sense from an English language perspective.
