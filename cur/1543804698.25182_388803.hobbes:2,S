According to my tests, the struct is 8-byte-aligned on x86_64, and
that's how I'd like it to be. 
Please don't ask me why it happens, I know that the alignment constraint
of a u64 on x86_64 is only 4.  But at least gcc-3.3.6 and gcc-4.0.3
(debian) result in __alignof__ of that test structure (and a 'u_int64_t
alone') to 8 bytes.  
When it comes to these things, I can only do trial+error.
Maybe it's because __alignof__ returns the recommended alignment, not
the required alignment.

That should make sure that we always get what we want, yes.
