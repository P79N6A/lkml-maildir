Bad example, that is not what happened at all.  There was not an
in-kernel USB stack when Linus wrote his.  Inaky had his
all-singing-all-dancing stack outside of the tree, and no one was really
helping out with it.
Only when Linus added his code to mainline did we all jump on it and
_incrementally_ improve it to what we have today.
So, in a way, you just proved that we need to do this in an incremental
fashion, which is what I was also saying all along :)
thanks,
