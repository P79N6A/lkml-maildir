Is something *else* logging the driver name and bus ID?
Just because an interface is called 'eth2' when the message is logged
doesn't mean it's still eth2 when you actually *read* the message.
And no, you *can't* rely on finding the "renaming bus-ID to ethN" message
in the logs - if the system is unstable the last bit of local logging may
go bye-bye if not synced, and messages about network hardware problems are
*very* prone to not making it to the syslog server (I wonder why? ;).
Been there, done that, it's not fun.  Almost swapped out the wrong eth1
a *second* time before realizing what was really going on...
