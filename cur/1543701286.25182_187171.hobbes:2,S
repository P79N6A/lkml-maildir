linux-megaraid-devel@dell.com is closed and gone now (only archives
remain).  megaraid driver issues should be discussed on
linux-scsi@vger.kernel.org now.  Atul had ported 2.00.6 or so to 2.6
already and posted it to linux-scsi for comment, before the hard
freeze hit; James may have newer code pending somewhere.
Thanks,
Matt
