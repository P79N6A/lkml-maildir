The second dma_xfer() can be in if (channels > 1) block (in addition
to different transfer bytes).  Something like below:
static int buffer_transfer(struct snd_pcm_substream*substream,
		int buffer_size, int period)
{
	int transferred;
	int dma_countout;
	struct snd_pcm_runtime *runtime;
	int period_offset;
	long dma_flags;
	period_offset = period;
	period_offset %= (AICA_PERIOD_NUMBER / runtime->channels);
	runtime = substream->runtime;
	/* transfer left and then right */
	dma_flags = claim_dma_lock();
	dma_countout = 0;
	dma_xfer(0,
		 runtime->dma_area + (AICA_PERIOD_SIZE * period_offset),
		 AICA_CHANNEL0_OFFSET +
		 (AICA_PERIOD_SIZE * period_offset), buffer_size / 2, 5);
	/* wait for completion */
	do {
		udelay(5);
		transferred = get_dma_residue(0);
		dma_countout++;
		if (dma_countout > 0x10000)
			break;	/* Approx 1/3 sec timeout in case of hardware failure */
	}
	while (transferred < buffer_size / 2);
	if (runtime->channels > 1) {
		dma_xfer(0,
			 AICA_BUFFER_SIZE / 2 + runtime->dma_area +
			 (AICA_PERIOD_SIZE * period_offset),
			 AICA_CHANNEL1_OFFSET +
			 (AICA_PERIOD_SIZE * period_offset), buffer_size / 2, 5);
		/* have to wait again */
		dma_countout = 0;
		do {
			udelay(5);
			transferred = get_dma_residue(0);
			dma_countout++;
			if (dma_countout > 0x10000)
				break;
		}
		while (transferred < buffer_size / 2);
	}
	release_dma_lock(dma_flags);
	return 0;
}
