Logical or otherwise, people _do_ this. I know plenty of people who
install linux or Redhat from the CD -- they never build their own
kernels, etc. It's not something they would consider; they like the
'shrink-wrap' stuff (sans security updates).
I don't know where Linux NFS is at right now; but in the past I've
tested it and it was pretty terrible compared to freebsd )I forget
what version) and solaris. The servers are NetApps if that matters.
