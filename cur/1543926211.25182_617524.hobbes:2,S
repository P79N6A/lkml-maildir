Quite possible. SLOB is more sensitive to off by one bugs because it
doesn't have the power-of-two buckets that SLAB/SLUB have. IIRC,
SLAB/SLUB's debugging features won't detect when you request 28 bytes,
get 32, then overwrite byte 29. But that will damage other objects or
the free list in SLOB.
But this isn't the per-page SLOB list that's getting clobbered, this
is the list of pages held in struct page.
