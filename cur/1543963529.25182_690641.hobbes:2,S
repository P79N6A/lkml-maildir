Jan, there is code in drivers/video/console/fbcon.c:fbcon_do_set_font()
which makes changes to vc->vc_video_erase_char, maybe that code needs
to update the new vc->vc_scrl_erase_char you added?
It would be nice if you could audit the tree to see if any other cases
have been missed like this as well.
