What for? If you do not want to get events form a device do not
read it. Or do not compile/load the driver. You can do a lot of
things from userspace.
Your problem is that you want to one piece of kernel to take over
another kernel piece instead of making it work together. With
your enable/disable scheme what happens where there is 3rd module
that wants to do stuff with speaker? Does it also disable snd-pcsp?

You just do not want to implement proper access control for the
hardware, that's it.
