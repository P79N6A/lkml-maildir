Hmm, but we seem to already have too many intro-to-git documents in tree.
Perhaps good points in the document can be used to augment or replace
parts of existing documents?  For example, which part of the new
documentation would have helped you avoid the pain you mentioned below...

... and which part of the existing user manual or tutorial should have
talked about it to help you?

"Acquired taste" is a much nicer and more diplomatic way to say the same
thing as what Linus often refers as "unlearning the braindamage inflicted
by years of using CVS." ;-)

I do not think it constitutes any basis for judging the merit of having
the document in git.git tree.  The world domination is not our goal, but
it may come as a mere side effect of being the best in the business.
