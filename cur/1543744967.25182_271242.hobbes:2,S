Excellent, that makes it a lot easier.

Oh, I see. I thought it was that either vm_set or prio_tree_node
was used. (Which I found somewhat confusing, but attributed my
confusion to simply not understanding all the strange ways of MM.)
Sorry about the confusion.
So yes, one more word then :-(

Yes, that sounds better. It would also allow for a later transition
of VMA_PRIO_TREE to GENERIC_PRIO_TREE.
Now, if we want to prepare things already now for a later migration,
it would be nice to call the generic one "struct prio_tree_node",
since it would eventually become the only node type anyway.
Perhaps something along these lines:
struct prio_tree_node {
	struct vma_prio_tree_node prio_tree_node;
	unsigned long r_index, h_index;
};
Or would you consider this as premature optimization ?

I also wonder how expensive the calculations in HEAP_INDEX are.
Probably not very.
To make the intrusive change a bit more palatable, vm_pgoff could
become #define vm_pgoff(vma) ((vma)->shared.prio_tree_node.r_index)
Okay, so now we only need someone who has meaningful MM tests to
tell us how badly this would hurt performance :-)
Thanks,
