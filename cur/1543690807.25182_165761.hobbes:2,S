I do not yet know how to answer such questions confidently.
I see (redhat-config-xfree86 --> tab Advanced) reports:
Video Card
Video Card Type = Intel 865
Memory Size = 16 megabytes
Driver = i810
Enable Hardware 3D Acceleration = no

Please allow me to disavow that first impression.
With CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK_SLEEP=y, I've now been counting keystrokes
til crash.  I count each of Ctrl+Alt+F5 and Ctrl+Alt+F7 as one stroke. 
Sometimes I crash, sometimes I do not.  I began logging life more
carefully when first I saw a few strokes cause a crash, and thereafter,
per boot:
8 strokes crashed.
60 strokes did not crash, so I gave up and rebooted to try again.
4 strokes crashed.  The first 2 seeming had logged me out, killing my
cat /proc/kmsg process.
8 strokes crashed.
26 strokes crashed.
...
The only consistency I see is that always an even number of strokes
cause a crash i.e. always the Ctrl+Alt+F7 switch back to my X console,
not the switch to a text console.
To prepare to crash, I only know of: sync umount ext3.  For me as yet
"Checking ... filesystem..." wastes less than three minutes per crash,
and I haven't yet perceptibly lost a disk.

Meanwhile, whether `sudo cat /proc/kmsg | tee ...` displays printk
intact or not also varies, without clearly correlating with whether a
crash will or will not occur.
So far, with CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK_SLEEP=y, trying `sudo cat /proc/kmsg
| tee ...` has never run well enough to capture the cause of the crash.

Remote ssh freezes and remote ping starts losing all packets.
