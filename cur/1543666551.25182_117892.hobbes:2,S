Thanks a lot for your answers. Well, it is not only microcode.o. It
happens for all compiled modules (at least, for a lot of them). Anyway,
I can see that all modules have been copied to /lib/modules/2.4.20 and
that the files modules.dep and modules.whatsoever have been created. A
fast look to modules.dep makes me think that this file seems to be OK.
May I use this kernel and these modules after all ignoring the depmod
errors or should I expect problems if I do so?
Thanks again.
