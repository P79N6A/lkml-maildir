Hi:
Forgive me if I'm not completely understanding this, but isn't release()
only called when the refcount of the file structure drops to zero? e.g.:
  [18]Note that release isn't invoked every time a process calls close.
  Whenever a file structure is shared (for example, after a fork or a
  dup), release won't be invoked until all copies are closed. If you need
  to flush pending data when any copy is closed, you should implement the
  flush method.
Seems to me that even /with/ a change in semantics of close(), only the
last call to close() would actually get notified of the failure.
Thinking to NFS, would flush() be a better file_operation to use?
Regards,
- Dave
