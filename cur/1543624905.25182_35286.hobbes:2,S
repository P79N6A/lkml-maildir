A synonym that does not exist on older kernels.

That function prototype _must_ _not_ change in 2.4 kernels. That 'int'
better be there on newer 2.4 kernels.

If you haven't noticed, loop-AES compiles and works fine on older kernels
without changing anything in kernel sources.

Transfer function prototype change does affect other implementations. I
would have to add workaround to compile loop-AES on older kernels. If
cryptoapi got one parameter wrong, I don't see why other implementations
should bend over because of that.
Herbert, if you need some special types and/or macros in cryptoapi, just
define them in cryptoapi include files. Please don't mess with code that
other implementations depend on.

What I do notice is having to add workaround. See, loop-AES only creates
patched-loop.c (but not patched-loop.h), and under some circumstances
patched-loop.c may come from newer code than loop.h. So it needs a
workaround if transfer function prototype is changed.

If IV parameter type is changed from 32 bits to 64 bits, you will need new
code and #ifdef's to handle that anyway. And that is 2.5/2.6 thing anyway.
