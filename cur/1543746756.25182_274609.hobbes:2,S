It's mostly used when setting up a new installation, and when attempting
LVM support. It's particularly useful in the later case because you can
swap off and so on, prepare your new LVM volume, prepare swap on it, do
the echo > resume2 and then check dmesg, and be assured that you've got
the right setup, all without needing to reboot. In the case of a new
config, you still need to reboot once, of course, into the new kernel,
but if you get the resume2= parameter wrong, you don't have to waste
time rebooting just because of a typo. You can just fix your lilo.conf
(or equiv) and use echo > resume2 to fix the mistake.

Yes, but that's also far uglier, and who thinks in terms of major and
minor numbers anyway? I think of my harddrive as /dev/sda, not 08:xx.
The parsing accepts majors and minors, of course, but shouldn't we make
these things easier to do, not harder? (Would we insist on using majors
and minors for root=?).

It has had it. We do rely on the user to make a sensible linuxrc/init,
but there are examples and warnings given in the docs on Berlios, and
plenty of checking done. We have to take the risk anyway: without it, we
can't support Debian (ide support built as modules), LVM (needs to set
up mappings in an initrd) or encrypted storage (ditto).

See above.
