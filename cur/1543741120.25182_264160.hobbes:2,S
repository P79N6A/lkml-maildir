Thanks again for the pointer, am slowly getting my head around this.
I haven't proven to myself that the isolcpus code gets rid of all of the
cross-runqueue lock acquisitions, but it certainly gets rid of a large
number of them.  It doesn't seem to do system-call or exception-handler
offload, but it does help me see how to do this sort of thing cleanly.
Dimitri, one nit so far...   Why is sched_domain_dummy under two
layers of #ifdef CONFIG_SMP?  Any reason why the attached patch
would not be in order?
						Thanx, Paul
