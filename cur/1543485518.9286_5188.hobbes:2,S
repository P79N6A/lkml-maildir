Hi,
when I had a look at down_interruptible(), I suspect that there could
be a race condition:
                                        sem->count sem->waking
No process holds the semaphore                   1           0
Process A acquires the semaphore                 0           0
Process B calls down_interruptible()            -1           0
Process B is interrupted and passes
          waking_non_zero()                     -1           0
Process A calls up() (on another CPU)            0           1
Process B calls atomic_inc(&sem->count)          1           1
!! No process is waiting, but sem->waking > 0 !!
Process C acquires the semaphore                 0           1
Process D calls down()                          -1           1
Process D passes waking_non_zero() and
          acquires the semaphore !!             -1           0
My suggestion is to replace in DOWN_TAIL()
	atomic_inc(&sem->count);
by
	wake_one_less(sem);
	up(sem);
[wake_one_less() would be defined analogous to wake_one_more()]
The difference is, that the up() call will take care about the special
condition if sem->count is already zero before it is increased.
This solution would allow sem->waking to be temporarily negative, in
which case waking_non_zero() must not allow processes to wake up.
For most but not all of the architectures waking_non_zero() is
already implemented this way. To make this requirement clearer,
	waking_non_zero()
should be renamed to
	waking_positive()
--
Further I would like to suggest a nonblocking down operation
down_nonblocking() analogous to down_interruptible(). I am working on
a device driver and want to protect resources with semaphores, while
still honoring O_NONBLOCK. For such a case a nonblocking down
operation would be very helpful.

I don't attach patches because they would affect architecture specific
code for all architectures, but I would not be able to test them all.
I'm willing to submit the (partly untested) diffs on demand.
