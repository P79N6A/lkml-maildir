Built and install a 2.2.13pre8 kernel and once I stuck a audio CD in I
started getting the following error. It would repeat steadily on all the
virtual terminals except the one where X was started from. I boot
into run level 3 so the message was showing up on 5 different virtual
terminals. I tried 3 different audio CD players (wmcdplay, wmsvencd, and
the KDE cd player) and still got the same behaviour. Once I shut the cd
players down, the messages also stop.  I could play an audio CD when I
first started the CD players, but if I tried skipping tracks the audio
wouldn't start again. Sound was still working from other utilities.  I
do not get the error with data CDs.  If I boot a 2.2.12 kernel built
with essentially the same .config file (Used same .config, just did a
"make oldconfig" for the 2.2.13pre8) I do not get the error.
Here is the error I was getting.  This was copied by hand, since it
wasn't showing up in any log files.

From dmesg some of the information concerning the ide channels.

I realise that I am a "little" out on the bleeding edge, and that the
error I've encountered may not be relevant to main stream Linux, but if
any one would like further information that might help squash this
particular problem, please feel free to ask for more information.
I am not on the mailing list.
