It would be nice if I had such a box. I can't even
find a user account on one. I have 32-bit ppc, plus
non-root accounts on alpha, i386, and x86_64 boxes
with obsolete kernels.

The inode numbering patch looks sane enough...

In no place does procps itself care about ino_t.
Perhaps your 32-bit glibc chokes on 64-bit inode numbers.
If so, yuck. It's really sad that we have a zillion
versions of stat(), many with oversize dev_t, and still
we use 32-bit ino_t in many places.
Whether or not that's the problem...
1. install a 64-bit or bi-arch gcc
2. install a 64-bit libc
3. install a 64-bit ncurses
4. install a 64-bit procps
(suggestion: keep going until /bin is done)
That's pretty much it. The procps package goes to
great lengths to compile itself 64-bit, even passing
the -m64 option and installing to /lib64 as needed.
If you've broken this, you get to keep the pieces.
In other words: seriously unsupported
I see no reason why 32-bit SPARC users should have
to suffer the pain of running code bloated up to
handle 64-bit SPARC. The 32-bit SPARC hardware is
slow enough already. Just try to look a 32-bit SPARC
user in the eye and tell him "Your system should run
even slower now, so that my hot new hardware can keep
running old 32-bit executables meant for you"
