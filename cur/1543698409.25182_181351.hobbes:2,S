This is where I get mildly lost, from what you are saying here I
would have expected a test on list_empty rather than on
fpos==2 also this occurs in every file, will starting in a different
pos in the list cause problems?
With further testing it also Oops even when the dir is not empty
I did a "touch /dev/shm/1 /dev/shm/2 /dev/shm/3" to put some
entries in the dir first and the original still oops at offset 2
I should do more testing, to see if I can find out what happens
on non empty dirs, because I was thinking it was due to the
dir being empty, which now appears not to be true.

Also is the new variable dentry needed or just a optimization?
It looks functionally equivalent, but perhaps it is needed for 
something I am not seeing at the moment.
