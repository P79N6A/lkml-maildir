Hi,
It looks like the ohci_hcd driver sometimes has problems with the
initialization (eg. USB mouse doesn't work after a fresh boot and reloading
of the driver helps).
I have observed this on two different x86_64 boxes (HPC 6325, Asus L5D),
but it is not readily reproducible.  Anyway I've got a dmesg output from a
failing case which is attached.
Greetings,
Rafael
