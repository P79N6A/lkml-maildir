Subject: [patch 0/8] Immediates Values (real variables)

Hi Andrew,
Here is the new version of the immediate values. It should be _must_ more useful
like this: it now provides full variables encoded as load immediates in the
instruction stream. It has been thoroughly tested too.
It applies to 2.6.22-rc6-mm1 (just like the text edit lock)
It depends on the text edit lock patches.
Mathieu
