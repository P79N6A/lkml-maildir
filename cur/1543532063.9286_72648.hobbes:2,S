I was about to try the same trick as you in your patch just to see... ;)
Well at least I tested your patch... And it works !
The test was done on : 
Linux version 2.3.99-pre3 (root@glacon) (gcc version 2.95.2 20000220 (Debian GNU/Linux)) #24 Tue Mar 28 12:11:33 CEST 2000

No more messages, and the NIC is working fine ! 
Good job...
