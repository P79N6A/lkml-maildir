Yeah, only the kobject_put() would free the name.

Sounds fine, maybe we should also pass the name along, so it will be
obvious what happens here:
  int kobject_init(struct kobject *kobj, struct kobj_type *type, const char *fmt, ...)

Oh, if you want to rewind on error and have an initialized but still
unregistered kobject, and just want to free the allocated name by
calling kobject_cleanup() or kobject_put() you might not expect, that
your whole object that embeds the kobject will be gone. Just something
we need to document ...
