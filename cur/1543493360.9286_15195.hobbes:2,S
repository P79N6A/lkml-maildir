I've set up a (still empty) CVS tree for this documentation
project. By using CVS we can get around the maintainer-on-
holiday and not-up-to-date problem. It also makes for easy
mirroring and editing by a crew of people.
For communication the linux-perf and kernel-doc mailing
lists are, IMHO, the most appropriate. Kernel-doc is
hosted by majordomo@nl.linux.org and linux-perf is hosted
at some German university mentioned a few messages back
in the thread...
