No, -Os is for size only :
       -Os Optimize for size.  -Os enables all -O2 optimizations
           that do not typically increase code size.  It also
           performs further optimizations designed to reduce code
           size.
So it is expected that speed can be reduced using -Os. I won't report
a thing which is already documented !

Optimizing is not a matter of choosing *one* way, but cumulating
everything you have. For instance, on a smart boot loader, I have
a kernel which is about 300 kB, or 700 kB with the initramfs. Among
the tricks I used :
  - -Os
  - -march=i386
  - align everything to 0
  - replace gzip with p7zip
Even if each of them reduces overall size by 5%, the net result is
0.95^4 = 0.81 = 19% gain, for the same set of features. This is
something to consider.
