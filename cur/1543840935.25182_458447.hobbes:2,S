You are changing this behavior right now...

...by adding a WARN_ON even though "work not enqueued because it is 
already in queue" may not be a "failure" at all.
It _is_ robust for callers to depend on the old behavior. This is 
because /we/ who use these functions will remind /you/ who alters these 
functions to first research what the actual usage is. So please check 
every caller which ignores the return code for the actual intent of the 
caller.
Do not add WARN_ON to queue_work() etc.. Instead add WARN_ON or BUG_ON 
or an actual failure handling to callers which _incorrectly_ expect they 
could add the same instance of work_struct to queues more than once 
before the work was executed.
Furthermore, if you already change the type of widely-used exported 
functions (i.e. you change the workqueue API), why don't you delete 
these functions right away?
