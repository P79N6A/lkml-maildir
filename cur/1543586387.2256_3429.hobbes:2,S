Subject: Bug in proc permition checks.

Somewhere between 2.2.16 and 2.4.1 a bug in
vfs_permission() in the file "fs/namei.c" has
been fixed. S_ISDIR(mode) was incorrect,
S_ISDIR(inode->i_mode) is correct.
The same piece of code exist in the proc
filesystem, here the bug has not been fixed.
I wonder why does the function exist in the
proc filesystem, shouldn't proc be able to
use the default permission cheks?
I have also found a lot of bugs in the file
arch/i386/kernel/vm86.c, this is not mentioned
in the maintainer list. Is there a maintainer
I can send a bug report to? If not I will try
to fix the bugs on my own.
