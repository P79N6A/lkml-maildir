yes: the task's position within the rbtree is updated every time 
wherever wait_runtime is change. task_new_fair is the method during new 
task creation, but indeed i forgot to requeue the parent. I've fixed 
this in my tree (see the delta patch below) - thanks!

Nick noticed that upon fork we change parent->wait_runtime but we do not 
requeue it within the rbtree.
