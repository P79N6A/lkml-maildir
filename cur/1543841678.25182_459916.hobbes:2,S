Yes.  Er.  Hm, perhaps not, it didn't build:
  CC      drivers/pci/htirq.o
drivers/pci/htirq.c: In function 'ht_create_irq':
drivers/pci/htirq.c:126: error: 'PCI_CAP_ID_HT' undeclared (first use in this function)
drivers/pci/htirq.c:126: error: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
drivers/pci/htirq.c:126: error: for each function it appears in.)
I'll try again with CONFIG_HT_IRQ disabled...
