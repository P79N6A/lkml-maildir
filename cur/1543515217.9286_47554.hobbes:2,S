Hello,
A while ago I can up with a system where modules could be
distributed as tar.gz's (or tar.bz2's). You would copy
them into /usr/src/linux/extras or some such and from
there it would be automagically included. It would be
unpacked automatically, 'make extras' would build all
the modules, etc. 'make *config' would have an extra option
in the main menu called 'Extras' which lead to a submenu
listing all the installed extras and the options for
those modules.
I got as far as getting it to unpack before my limited knowledge
of the kernel makefile and build system became a problem and
I ran out of time.
What I want to know is if this is the sort of system we should
be aiming for or is there some fundamental flaw? I beleive
its biggest attraction is that it would allow a GUI tool
to automatically download a driver, compile and install with
a minimum of fuss.
You could even run a mini version of xconfig on the subdirectory
to allow users to configure it.
Comments?
In awe of your knowledge, ;)
