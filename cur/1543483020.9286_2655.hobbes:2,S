Uli, can we please have a RELEASE of glibc?  It is now a "stable"
kernel series.  Do we have to use an ALPHA libc with it?  The last
release was 2.0.6, and you long ago were telling people who fell
over the bugs in it to upgrade.
Also, is the crypt for 2.0.111 on the .no site?  There has been no
sign there of a glibc-crypt versioned for recent glibc alphas.  How
are foreigners supposed to get it?  I'm guessing that the version
that is there will work with all later versions of glibc, but that
is not what you say in the documentation, you say there is a
corresponding version, IIRC.
