Subject: [PATCH 8/10] CRIS architecture update - Move drivers
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/11/2/86

This is a shell script to move drivers from arch/cris/arch-v10/drivers to
e.g. drivers/net/cris/v10. This must be applied after patch 1-7 and before
patch 9.
Let me know if you prefer this as a big diff instead.
