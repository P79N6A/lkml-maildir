Greetings,
I've been working on an XTP implementation for Linux for some time
(and will be the first to admit that I'm order due for releasing
it publically).
I recently  ported it to kernel 2.3.x and am in the process of (re)sending
a patch to David.
I'm doing this strictly on a volunteer basis, which means I can respond to
emails
during the evenings and have limitted time for its development--but unlimitted
interested in its growth and potential.  More info will follow.
Quick synopsis of XTP:
XTP is quite flexible and versatile, capable of offering UDP-like and TCP-like
services--and everything in between--in one protocol stack.  However, its
flexibility
is also its weak point.  There is little public
data-experience-testing-implementation
on making XTP work in an IP environment, hence this XTP-Linux project.
There are also several transport issues that need to be explored in an XTP/IP
environment.
If anyone is really interested in this and wants to help out, let me know
offline.
Thanks,
Vince.
