The changes include:
	an update to 2.3.99-pre3
	the block driver now falls back from read-write to read-only when it is given 
a read-only file
	changed the network device to configure itself correctly more often and give 
better errors when it doesn't
	fixed various bugs, including a crash when running it on Mandrake, a hang, 
and a compilation error
It can build kernels (probably including itself, but I haven't checked this), 
and, even more impressively, run emacs :-)
The patch and kernel are available from
