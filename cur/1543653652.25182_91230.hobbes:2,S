Andreas,
Please send the patches separately to Linus and Marcelo.  I know Linus 
doesn't like patches as attachements, especially when mail contains two 
different patches, only one of which he can apply.  (Think about saving 
the email to a file and running patch against it.)
Otherwise, the patches look good to me.
Thanks,
Shaggy
