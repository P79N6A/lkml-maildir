It should work with most kernels. Just the level of tuning
during runtime varies (with more tuning the newer the kernel) 
Certainly does for me at least on the AMD reference motherboards/BIOS.
Can you connect a serial console and boot with
earlyprintk=serial,ttyS0,baudrate and post the full crash log?
Please test in advance from a booting kernel if the serial cable etc. really 
work.
