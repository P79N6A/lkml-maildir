All I said was "ensuring userspace cannot cause invalid GPU microcode to 
be generated."
No matter what runs with root priveleges, other graphics processes do 
not, and one must ensure that app clients cannot generate sequences 
which cause the hardware to fail.  Which is a lot more difficult, when 
the unpriveleged app clients are submitting GLSL.
