All stack offsets are accessed relative to SS. No exceptions.
However a compiler may calculate those offsets based upon
something else.
This is why DS must equal SS if 'C' is going to access both
stack data variables and data segment variables. This is how
the 'C' code converter is set up. It is not a CPU limitation.
If you change the SS in the kernel, strange and wonderful
things will occur.
Cheers,
