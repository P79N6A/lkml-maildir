Hi again.

No swap was used - apart from anything else, the machine in question
didn't have any swap set up to use. What it DOES have is 1G of RAM to
play with, which is all that the standard Linux kernel can make use of
without code tweaking anyway...

What you've overlooked is that make has an inbuilt limit, in that it
won't start child processes for more than one directory at a time.
Here's a count of the number of *.c files in each directory containing
more than 50 of them in kernel 2.2.7 (which I have to hand):
 Q>  67  /usr/src/linux-2.2.7/drivers/sound
 Q>  69  /usr/src/linux-2.2.7/drivers/video
 Q>  74  /usr/src/linux-2.2.7/drivers/char
 Q> 103  /usr/src/linux-2.2.7/drivers/scsi
 Q> 124  /usr/src/linux-2.2.7/drivers/net
As you can see, your -j80 would've been the equivalent of -j on all
except the last two, and the -j that I used was the same as -j124 in
this case...probably lower as 2.2.7 wasnae out when I was playing with
that box - I believe 2.2.5 was current at the time...
Incidentally, the above count was produced with the following script:
 Q> #!/bin/bash
 Q> function fetch() {
 Q>     for DIR in `find $1 -type d` ; do
 Q>         COUNT=`ls -1 $DIR/*.c | wc -l`
 Q>         printf '%5u  %s\n' $COUNT $DIR
 Q>     done
 Q> }
 Q> fetch /usr/src/linux-2.2.7 | sort -n
You can now verify the results on other kernel trees...

I don't have access to the system in question now, so can't do any
more tests on it...

As stated above, I no longer have access to the box in question, so
can't do so...
Best wishes from Riley.
