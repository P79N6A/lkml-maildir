Hmm, I was hoping we'd kill irqreturn_t some day: I don't think 2.4 
compatibility is worth much any more.
That means doing similar things for stop_machine and kthread_create (just from 
looking at this patch series).
The benefits of natural-typed callback args drops if the return type pays the 
price.
Cheers,
Rusty.
