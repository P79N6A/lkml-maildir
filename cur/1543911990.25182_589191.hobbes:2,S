See Documentation/SubmittingPatches:
14) The canonical patch format:
The canonical patch message body contains the following:
  - A "from" line specifying the patch author.
  - An empty line.
  - The body of the explanation, which will be copied to the
    permanent changelog to describe this patch.
  - The "Signed-off-by:" lines, described above, which will
    also go in the changelog.
  - A marker line containing simply "---".
  - Any additional comments not suitable for the changelog.
  - The actual patch (diff output).
so just put whatever you want to be in the permanent SCM logs
into the "body of the explanation" part of the email.
