I doubt any of those will help.  It sounds like a driver bug wrt to
non-coherent PCI.  Presumably this will also hit sparc people if they
use this hardware and some PPC too.
Does the driver use the *dma_sync* API(s)?  You might want to read
over Documentation/DMA-API.txt and see if the driver is doing the
right things.
