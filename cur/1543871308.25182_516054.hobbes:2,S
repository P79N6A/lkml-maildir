Ok, in separate mail I see you already did the work...

...of 3., and code is nicely generic and fairly simple. I thought it
would be too much work to implemente it, and it would get too messy.
Given that it is so simple, I believe 3. is the best option. We can
still do 1. in future if we feel like so...
