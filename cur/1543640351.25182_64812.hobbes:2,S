And where reasonable != 94%. Seriously, 94% scalability could be on a
8 CPUs 880, but, for example, I have a 64 CPUS domain on a E10k which is
far from 94% scalability (ok, an old E10k with an 83Mhz bus).
For what I saw, maybe SGI Origin 3000 is scaling
a little better with a lot of CPUS, but I also never had an E15000 around
for now...
