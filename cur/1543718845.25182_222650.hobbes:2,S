no, that's not what I remeber from alpha, alpha always sets the young
bit as soon as it sets the pte from non-null to something. No matter
what kind of pte is that (readonly/writeonly/whatever). Then this bit is
cleared by the VM but nothing ever happens again. The accessed bit is
quite useless infact.

It definitely is, there's no way the architecture can loop on a bit that
doesn't exist as far as the hardware is concerned.
see the code:
/* .. and these are ours ... */
#define _PAGE_DIRTY	0x20000
#define _PAGE_ACCESSED	0x40000
#define _PAGE_FILE	0x80000	/* set:pagecache, unset:swap */
extern inline int pte_young(pte_t pte)		{ return pte_val(pte) & _PAGE_ACCESSED; }
extern inline pte_t pte_mkyoung(pte_t pte)	{ pte_val(pte) |= __ACCESS_BITS; return pte; }
So alpha will work fine, there's absolutely no way pte_mkyoung can avoid
the next page fault, period.
furthermore there is no way to keep the accessed bit coherent without
hardware support, I tried that while I was working on the alpha some
year ago but there's no way. The accessed bit in software is only useful
to give a second chance to pages paged in recently (if useful at all).
There are two ways to do the hardware support, one is what x86 does,
that is to set the bit without a page fault that enters kernel. The
other way is an option that ia64 has to generate even the page fault.
My fix works fine for x86* and alpha. It may not work for ia64 if it's
using hardware page faults to set the young bit. comments on this detail
from the ia64 developers would be welcome.
