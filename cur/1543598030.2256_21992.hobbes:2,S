Some notes:
1) It should probably print the ioctl as 0x%X, because this makes it a lot
   easier to decode which ioctl it is.
2) The ioctl in question is actually BLKGETSIZE64, which is part of Jens'
   64-bit block device patch, but is not part of the stock kernel.  It
   was added to e2fsprogs in order to support devices > 2TB.
3) Drivers probably shouldn't complain about ioctls they don't understand,
   as it just causes a lot of grief (see this thread here).  If anything,
   they _could_ complain about specific obsolete ioctl numbers, or maybe
   ioctl numbers in their "allocated" namespace (0x09 for MD it appears).
   Even so, this "breaks" forward compatibility, if tools try to use a
   new ioctl on an older kernel before falling back to the old ioctl, you
   get a lot of spurious warnings.
Cheers, Andreas
