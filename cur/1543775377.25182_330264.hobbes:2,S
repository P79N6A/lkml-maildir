Why do parent devices need to be locked?  Reference counting in the
driver core should take care of everything properly, right?  Also, these
are not hotpluggable devices, so it should be a lot easier :)

Well, yes and no.  I see the driver core driving a lot of interactions,
due to the probing and matching and disconnecting all coming from the
core, but I guess as they are usually initiated from the bus itself, I
can see how you feel this way also.  So ok, yes, this is a change, I
agree.  But it isn't one that should cause major issues.

You can set a flag if those functions come from your own bus (due to
device/driver add/remove) and check that, but I agree, that's an ugly
hack...

Heh, at least I tried 2 :)
No, I don't mean to be sloppy, I just tested what I had availble, like
almost everyone else.

"rescan"?  Like reprobe the bus address space?  That sounds like a bus
specific issue.  But if you like I could add a general bus callback for
that and an attribute for it.  I know pci could use that for some odd
cases (see the fakephp driver for an example of how to do rescan for pci
devices from a driver itself.)

Yes, and as such, rescan should be a bus attribute, not a driver or
device one.

No, I put bind/unbind in the driver directory.  There is no additions to
the device directory.

Um, I don't recall what you are referring to here.  Have a
pointer/patch?
