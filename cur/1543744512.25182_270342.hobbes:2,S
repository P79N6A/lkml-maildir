i have released the -V0.7.25-1 Real-Time Preemption patch, which can be
downloaded from the usual place:
    
http://redhat.com/~mingo/realtime-preempt/
this is a fixes-only release that resolves a couple of bugs that slipped
into -V0.7.25-0:
 - lockup/deadlock fix: make debug_direct_keyboard default to 0. It is
   only a debug helper to be used for development, it was never intended
   to be enabled. This fix should resolve the bugs reported by Gunther
   Persoons and Mark H. Johnson.
 - fix symbol export problems in rtc.ko, reported by Remi Colinet, based
   on the patch from K.R. Foley.
 - make preempt_wakeup_timing default to 1 if enabled in the .config, as 
   originally intended.
