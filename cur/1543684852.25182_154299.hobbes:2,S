  HJ> Does it work on bigsur?
It should, apart from a qla1280.c glitch (see the latest ia64 diff for
the one-liner to get it to work; Jes Sorensen said he's going to
cleanup qla1280 for real).
  HJ> Does it support kernel modules?
Sure.  Kernel modules have been working for a while.  You do need
module-init-tools, of course (Debian has the necessary package in the
"unstable" tree).
