I cannot confirm this.  I wasted a lot of time on getting it to work.
Without avail.

That's irrelevant.  Nobody needs the interface in 64-bit mode if there
is the prctl() code.  Yes, there will be one more if() in copy_thread,
but so what?

This limits the scalability.  Forever.

And the problem is?  Nobody must mug around with the segment registers
without knowing what s/he does.
If you want to change the %fs/%gs value temporarily follow this receipe:
  if (%[fg]s index is zero)
    saveidx = 0
    saveaddr = prctl (ARCH_GET_[FG]S)
  else
    saveidx = index of %[fg]s
  [...do your work...]
  if (saveidx == 0)
    prctl(ARCH_SET_[FG]S, saveaddr)
  else
    %[fg]s = saveindex
It's nothing you cannot handle from userspace.

Every program needs porting.  Normal memory allocation isn't guaranteed
to yield addresses < 4GB and therefore the use as a segment base address
fails.  Beside that, any program which modifies segment registers (I
cannot even think of more than two) are special and already have
portability code included if they run on machines != x86.

Who says something about changing the LDT handling?  The set_thread_area
syscall handles the GDT.  And you cannot modify the GDT address
registered with a given index in another thread or process except with
ptrace().  Not even on x86.

You don't need two interface.  Make prctl() do it automatically.  It has
all the info it needs.  Forget about the set_thread_area syscall in
64-bit mode and simply use one fixed GDT entry in case the address
passed to pcrtl() is small enough.  Same for clone(): the SETTLS
parameter shole be a simple address.  Treat it as passed to prctl() and
use a segment or the MSR.
Te only remaining question is who to load the segment register.   There
are two possibilities:
- - have prctl() return the index and expect the user to load it.  This is
  slightly binary incompatible (existing code depends on no such
  requirement).  It could be solved by introducing ARCH_SET_FS_AUTO or
  so;
- - automatically load the %fs or %gs register with the correct value
  before returning from prctl().  This introduces no binary
  incompatibilities and it's really the expected behavior.
If you don't want to do the work help me to get 2.5 running on my
machine and I'll come up with a patch.
