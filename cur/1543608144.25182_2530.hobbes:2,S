The way the test code works is, it keeps mlocking more blocks of memory until 
one of the mlocks fails, and then it does the rest of its work with that many 
blocks of memory.  It's hard to see how we could get a legitimate oom with 
that strategy.

OK, he tried it with pre5aa1:

*Just in case* it's oom-related I've asked Ben to try it with one less than 
the maximum number of memory blocks he can allocate.
If it does turn out to be oom, it's still a bug, right?
