No.  I agree that mkdir/mknod/etc. should all take the same thing.
*However*, it should not be nameidata or file.  Why?  Because it
should not contain vfsmount.  Object creation should not *care*
where fs is mounted.  At all.  The same goes for open(), BTW - letting
it see the reference to vfsmount via nameidata is bloody wrong and
I really couldn't care less what kinds of perversions apparmour crowd
might like - pathnames simply do not belong there.
Said that, I agree that we need uniform prototypes for all these guys
and I can see arguments both for and against having creds passed by
reference stored in whatever struct we are passing (for: copy-on-write
refcounted cred objects would almost never have to be modified or
copied and normally we would just pick the current creds reference
from task_struct and assing it to a single field in whatever we pass
instead of nameidata; against: might be conceptually simpler to have
all that data directly in that struct and a helper filling it in).
Which way we do that and which struct we end up passing is a very good
question, but I want to make it very clear: having object creation/removal/
renaming methods[1] depend on which vfsmount we are dealing with is *wrong*.
IOW, I strongly object against the use of nameidata here.
