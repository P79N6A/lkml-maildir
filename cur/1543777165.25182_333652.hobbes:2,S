Hi,
(2.6.13-rc2 or later)
This appears to be a dependency bug in gconfig to me.
If I enable NETCONSOLE to y, NETPOLL becomes y.  (OK)
If I then disable NETCONSOLE to n, NETPOLL remains y.
If I enable NETCONSOLE to m, NETPOLL remains n.  Why is that?
config NETPOLL
	def_bool NETCONSOLE
Should this cause NETCONSOLE to track NETPOLL?
xconfig and menuconfig have much stricter tracking of
NETCONSOLE -> NETPOLL.  E.g.,
enabling NETCONSOLE=m or y in xconfig also enables NETPOLL=y
and disabling NETCONSOLE also disables NETPOLL.
