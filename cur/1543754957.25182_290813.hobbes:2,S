To be clear, the parisc code defines this in include/asm-parisc/pci.h:
#define HBA_PORT_SPACE_BITS     16
#define PCI_PORT_HBA(a)    ((a) >> HBA_PORT_SPACE_BITS)
and PCI_PORT_HBA gets used in arch/parisc/kernel/pci.c.
Offhand, I don't know if ia64 has the equivalent.
But it sounds like it might need it.
