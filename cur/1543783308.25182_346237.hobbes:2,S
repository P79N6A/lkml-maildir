Great.

Actually to some degree this patch does that, albeit only on things that are 
swapped out "naturally". Anything that is swapped out and is unnaturally 
swapped back in using prefetching is kept on swap, and you often find much 
more swap sitting around ready for freeing up ram whenever there is memory 
pressure again.
