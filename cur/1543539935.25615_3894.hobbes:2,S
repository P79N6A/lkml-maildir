Well, that could be the case in some scenarios but I think it is
more the industry doing it because they know that people aren't
causing a stir about it.  Most likely, they are charging more
money for the drive anyway regardless of the jumper existence or
not, and then making the 45B for it anyways without including
it.  Joe "sheep" just buys whatever, and they get away with it.
If joe sheep started demanding it though, the cost of the jumper
would get eaten pretty quick I think.
