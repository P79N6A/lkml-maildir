I seem to have an issue, maybe a bug, with test7 on athlon smp.
The kernel is compiled for athlon with smp and acpi (acpi makes no
difference though) and I am receiving strange errors with several
network utils.
ifconfig returns this with I execute 'ifconfig':
: error fetching interface information: Device not found
yet, if I run 'ifconfig eth1' or with any other interface as the
argument I get:
eth1      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:04:75:B1:A4:47
          inet addr:12.148.210.98  Bcast:12.255.255.255 
Mask:255.255.255.224
          inet6 addr: fe80::204:75ff:feb1:a447/64 Scope:Link
          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1
          RX packets:10117 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
          TX packets:10592 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0

          Interrupt:19 Base address:0x2000
which is the correct output.  If I configure the ip manually with
ifconfig for the device, and set routes with 'ip', the card works fine.
Also, dhclient and other programs give me similar errors.
output of dhclient:

Can't get interface flags for : No such device
exiting.
Adding the interface as an argument makes no difference here.
Anyone have ideas what is going on?
