If you wait with releases until every last and final bug is fixed,
you'll never get a release out, because there is always SOME bug
somewhere left, the kernel is just too big for that to not be the case.
It's a matter of priorities if a defect is a stopship  or not, and it
seems the bug in question isn't according to the release managers
opinion.
