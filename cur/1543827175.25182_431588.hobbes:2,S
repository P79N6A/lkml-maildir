Nothing precludes it.  The point is that introducing major format 
changes inline in this manner just complicates the code progressively to 
the point where your directory walking, inode block walking, and other 
code winds up being
	if (new)
		...
	else
		...
_anyway_, at which point it is essentially multiple independent 
filesystems.  I guarantee this won't be the last fundamental fs metadata 
design change people will want to make...
