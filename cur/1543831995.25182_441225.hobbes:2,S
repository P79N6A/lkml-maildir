Accept the facts -- for some reason, there is a fairly large user base
that goes to all the bother of using suspend2, which requires
downloading, patching and all the extra work. People do it, in spite of
the wonderful swsusp being in the kernel and all the other extra cool
stuff being worked on.
That is a fact, and all the hand waving won't change it.
I'm tired of this. It's taking years for Linux to get reasonably working
suspend facilities, which is a shame. In my opinion a large part of the
problem is you opposing Nigel's patches. Problem is, for many people
Nigel's code works while yours does not.
One thing to note here: "works" means "suspends and resumes every
time". It doesn't mean "doesn't suspend when blah blah" or "suspends
unless driver X does Y, then it panics" or "suspends most of the time,
except when it says BUG() because that's clearly the right thing to
do". Try using a Mac to see how suspend should work.
I strongly believe suspend2 should be included in the mainstream
kernels, at least to give people the choice and get it on equal footing
with the other implementations.
