I see it exactly the same way.
Well I will continue to provide an alternative stack with alternative drivers.
The peer review shows that it doesn't work too well without people participating
fixing problems, the initial drivers were inkernel based and due some updates in
modules which are used by the em28xx some devices which previously worked
don't work anymore in the kernel.
As for the em28xx the driver will use userspace i2c based tuners, decoders and
demodulators.
The userspace modules will use unaltered sample drivers which are provided by
several companies, which also saves alot time in future for that project.
Those drivers will also officially be provided and recommended by the
manufacturing company of those devices, including the proper firmware.
Personally I won't spend any time on reinventing the wheel and fixing drivers
which get broken by not taking care of it.
Beside that people are welcome to contribute without having to fear a political
overhead of discussing requirements and other issues when changing the
corresponding alternative core code. The project and how it will/should go on
is documented at mcentral.de.
I also see that as a good way for the community, that way the linuxtv guys
have to prove that they can be open to other people without adding too
much noise and overhead otherwise people will contribute to the alternative
project as some already do.
