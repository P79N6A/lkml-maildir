I tried doing it on the ppc for a while (native LE devices running LE and
BE devices running BE).  It was a nightmare that I quickly fled from.  
The overhead of checking the mode we just came from was killing us.  I
couldn't find a clean way of doing that.  The drain in time writing that
code certainly wasn't worth the effort.

You'd argue that running LE on machines with mostly LE devices isn't a
good technical reason?  Even if the overhead of swapping (an instruction
for it) isn't too large it certainly would make things cleaner.
