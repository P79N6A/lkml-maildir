Subject: [PATCH 0/8] RSS controller based on process containers (v3)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Adds RSS accounting and control within a container.
Ported above Paul's containers V10 with fixes received from Balbir.
RSS container includes the per-container RSS accounting
and reclamation, and out-of-memory killer. The container
behaves like a standalone machine - when it runs out of
resources, it tries to reclaim some pages, and if it doesn't
succeed, kills some task which mm_struct belongs to the
container in question.
