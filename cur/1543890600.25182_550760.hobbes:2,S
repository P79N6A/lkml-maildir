Unsafe vs safe is within 10%. Its okay.

Not just numbers. Most of applications cannot afford to use unsafe
versions anyway (like fs people).

compressed cache people require every single percent of that
performance. For now, ccaching is not ready for mainline (many things
need to be done). So, till then I will keep off the unsafe version. If
ever compressed caching is on its way to mainline _then_ I will try
and add back the unsafe version. But I see no other project that
really cares about unsafe version so it's okay to keep it off.
