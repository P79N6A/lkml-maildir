Thanks for the tip. I'll have to read the code more carefully to 
understand better where the userspace ends and the kernel begins, so 
that I don't do similar mistakes in the future.
I'll redo the patch and post it for review, probably during next week. I 
don't think there is much hurry, because, even if this gets accepted, it 
should go in only in 2.6.12-rc1-mm1 or something like that, so there is 
still time to review this more carefully.
Thanks for reviewing the patch,
