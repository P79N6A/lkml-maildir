Unfortunately not - you get the same failure with piix (am I right in 
thinking that piix doesn't have any suspend/resume methods beyond the 
generic PCI ones? I'm afraid I don't have enough knowledge of the IDE 
layer to know if there's some other magic that calls an ide-specific 
resume function in it...)
