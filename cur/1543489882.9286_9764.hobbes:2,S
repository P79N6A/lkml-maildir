You see what M$ already did. They destroyed dr-dos (windows 3.1 beta
detected dr-dos and displayed a stupid error message). They tried to
destroyed netscape. For example: some micro$oft registry clearing program
(I don't know the name) damages registry so that you can't display
preferences in netscape4 (I really saw it). It's quite effective - when
the user clicks on "preferences" after long time, he doesn't notice that
the error is because of M$ registry cleaning. He simply says that netscape
is shit and switches to explorer. 
Now they're going to destroy linux :-(
Windows installation programs generally put garbage to registry, modify
autoexec.bat, config.sys, win.ini and other config files and copy a lot of
dlls to windows/system directory over the original ones. And many of these
programs do it without asking the user.
So what do you think the MS Office instaler for linux will do? Installers
are run with root privileges, so they can do what they want. It will
surelly create a lot of waste over the whole filesystem, modify existing
config files so that some programs stop to work and overwrite the
libraries in /lib and /usr/lib with Microsoft(r) versions. 
They can't stop linux working immediatelly after installation of MS
Office, but I_am_sure, that the installation will make linux or some linux
programs unstable and unusable.
And the user says: "grrr, that linux is shit - when I run Office on
Microsoft Windows, it doesn't crash so often".
