It's possible to 'fix' some remote modems by exploiting the bug. You can
run
 ping -c 1 -p 2b2b2b415453323d32353526574f310d
which will send '+ + + ATS2=255&WO1' - go into command mode, disable the
escape code, store the current config, and go back online. Some modems
choke on the go back online part, but most will process the other
commands.
I've had a web page up for a while which will ping you if you need to fix
your modem:
