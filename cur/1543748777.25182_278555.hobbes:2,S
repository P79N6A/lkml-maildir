While this is all supremely cool, my inbox has several reactions from cifs
users about my never addressed query [1] on linux-cifs-clients regarding memory
leaks you can drive a truck through in cifs.

I'd love to deploy cifs and I've recommended it to many people, they've all
switched back to smbfs!
Now while I fully understand open source ethics (breaks, both pieces etc),
I'd really hope cifs would shape up in terms of ""enterprise reliability"".
Anything I can do to help, let me know. The referred URL contains some of my
conclusions at the time.
Thanks.
