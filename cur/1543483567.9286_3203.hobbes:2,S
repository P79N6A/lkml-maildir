    When I do a `cat /dev/st0' on my system (or access the tape in any other way), 
    the message
            Wrong buffer length supplied for request sense (256)
    is displayed on the console and the system locks up, VC switching
    still works. It's perfectly reproducable.
    From: Joaquim Fellmann <jfellman@prope.insa-lyon.fr>
    I got right the same message on my system at boot time
    Looks like coming from the SCSI driver; I've an Adaptec 1542 too
    Right after loading scsi driver the system locks up and I must
    reboot with another kernel such 2.0.*
    Only the cdrom is scsi; no discs or tape (and very *old* scsi)
    As usual it worked fine with others 2.0.* 
Hmm - yes, my memory is bad but I recall encountering this
and finding out where it was caused. If it was in aha1542.c
then I probably fixed it. If it was in scsi_error.c or so
then I didnt fix it.
Anyway, could you try and see whether my aha1542.c fares any better?
These days it is no longer available on ftp.win.tue.nl
but ftp.cwi.nl/pub/aeb may work.

[Of course the real problem is either a hardware error
or a bug elsewhere in the SCSI code that makes things look
like a hardware error. Linux reacts very ungracefully to
hardware errors, but I hope my aha1542.c does not cause a
system crash in quite so many cases as the default one.]
[This aha1542.c works with 2.1.132 - other kernels untested.]
[Something entirely different is that the semantics of a
semaphore was changed recently. This breaks scsi_error.c.]
