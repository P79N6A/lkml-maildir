LILO reads the field setup_sects and it may write vid_mode. It doesn't
use (or run) any of the code in bootsect.S. When loading images
without implicitly known size, LILO requires the user to specify the
size (i.e. image = /dev/foo range = 1-100).
Considering that nothing but bootsect.S itself uses syssize, the most
straightforward solution to the problem seems to be to change the unit
of syssize from paragraphs to sectors, to increase the header version
number in setup.S (not 100% clean, but the best approximation to a
version number for bootsect.S we have), and to update the checks
accordingly.
