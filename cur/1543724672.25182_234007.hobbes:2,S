As Anders Johansson pointed out to me, the original patch is necessary - 
reversing it makes the loop
do {
                         msleep(10);
                         msec -= 10;
                         pci_read_config_dword 
(to_pci_dev(ehci->hcd.self.controller), where, &cap);
                 } while ((cap & (1 << 16)) && msec);
only execute once and makes the if block inaccessible.  Thanks for pointing 
that out...guess I was overly excited when it worked again and didn't think 
much into it.
I'm confused as to how bypassing all that via my (bad) patch allows it to 
work though.  I'd like to know more about this bit of code, if anyone have 
more general info on it, so I can keep trying to help find the culprit.
