Subject: [PATCH] Moschip 7840 USB-Serial Driver
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Worked with the tech support folks at Moschip Semiconductor to get the driver 
working on the latest kernel.  We've been using it for a bit now and it appears 
to be working well.  They're okay with kernel inclusion of the driver.  I've 
cleaned it up a bit and put this patch together.
The patch is against 2.6.18-rc5.  Please apply, it can be found here:
