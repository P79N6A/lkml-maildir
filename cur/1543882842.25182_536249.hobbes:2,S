8 of them have been reported in March or earlier. [1]
Patches for 2 of these 8 were available at the time of the release. [2]
While the question whether to merge one of them into 2.6.21 was 
controversial, the other one was not controversial.
For one of the bugs, it became obvious when someone looked at it after 
the release of 2.6.21 that between the bug report on March 31th and the 
release of 2.6.21 on April 21th, noone started debugging this bug. [3] [4]

    fixed in 2.6.21, I hope you get my point
