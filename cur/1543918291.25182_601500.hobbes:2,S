But these guys are pinned anyway (or else they would already be moved
into a smaller load balanced cpuset), so why waste time load balancing
what can't move?
And on some of the systems I care about, we don't want to load balance
these guys; rather we go to great lengths to see that they don't run at
all when we don't want them to.
