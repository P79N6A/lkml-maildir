Very strange. Does glxinfo output look sane too? Especially the
OpenGL renderer string. It sounds like it isn't doing hw rendering
even if your X log says it is..

Not good at all. 'bad shit happened'.

It's essentially the same code though, which doesn't
make a lot of sense.

Again, puzzling. What reason is given for this in your
XFree86.log ?

The fact that this lot appears twice is odd, or did you
restart the X server ?

So X tried to load a module (likely the DRI part), and in doing so
something went awry.
Could be that something else caused memory corruption beforehand,
but that's speculation.  If this always happens the second time
the server starts, it could be a problem with reentrancy of the
r200 dri module maybe. *shrug*.
Frankly, from this backtrace, I've no idea.
There are a bunch of radeon fixes pending in the DRI tree,
so things could suddenly 'start working' again, so this could
be one to keep an eye on in bugzilla for now so we don't forget about it.
