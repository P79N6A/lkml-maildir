That's hypocrisy.
"i386-redhat-linux", eh?  On S.u.S.E.?  Debian?  Stampede?  Pacific Hi-Tech? 
 None of which are sufficiently different to require a different canonical 
triplet.  So all of them would end up being identified as "redhat"... and I 
fail to see how identifying other Linux distributions as Red Hat (or Red Hat 
wannabees) differs from your complaint about "GNU/Linux".

     We are Linux. Resistance is an indication that you missed the point.
