I'm sure you do have a nice long story, and I'm sure it seems
correct, but there is something not quite right about the add-on
hacks.
BTW, I'm suggesting that this be about deletion, not protection
of data you wish to keep. It covers more than just file bodies.
It covers inode data, block allocations, etc.

Can a regular user create and use a subvolume? If not, then
this doesn't work. (if so, then I have other concerns...)
