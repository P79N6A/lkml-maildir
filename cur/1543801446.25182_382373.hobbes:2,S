Yes, but we only do this for routines that we look at anyway.
Also, the profiles can be misleading at times: you often get instructions 
with zero hits, because they always schedule together with another 
instruction. So parsing things and then matching them up (correctly) with 
the source code in order to annotate them is probably pretty nontrivial.
But starting with the code-paths that get literally zero profile events is 
definitely the way to go.

We don't have likely()/unlikely() that often, and at least in my case it's 
partly because the syntax is a pain (it would probably have been better to 
include the "if ()" part in the syntax - the millions of parenthesis just 
drive me wild).
So yeah, we tend to put likely/unlikely only on really obvious stuff, and 
only on functions where we think about it. So we probably don't get it 
wrong that often.

That's an interesting use of "fortunately". I tend to prefer the form 
where it means "fortunately, we can trivially fix this with a two-line 
solution that is obviously correct" ;)
