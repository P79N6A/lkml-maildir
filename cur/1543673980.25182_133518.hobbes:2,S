Insert and Delete char are especially funny, as they do:
scr_memsetw(p, video_erase_char, nr * 2);
...
attr = video_erase_char >> 8;
while (nr--) {
   sw->con_putc(vc_cons[currcons].d,
                video_erase_char, y,
                video_num_columns-1-nr);
}
attr = oldattr;
so we can turn whole loop into one single putcs() call, asking
for painting 'nr' characters from 'p' at y,video_num_columns-nr, 
which will definitely help... And I believe that vc's attr is not 
used by putc/putcs anymore, we always pass color explicit (in upper 
bits of character).
