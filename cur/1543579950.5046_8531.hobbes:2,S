Is there a way to know what options a running kernel was compiled with,
if you dont have access to the source or configure files it was compiled
off of?
In particular, I am trying to discover if 'advanced router' and 'equal
cost multi path' options are compiled into RH7 kernel-2.2.16-22. I would
also like to know if there is a way to discover this information for
other settings that do not have a /proc entry or other visible object
(eg modules).
I am not following this list currently, so if you would please include
my email in the replies, I would appreciate it.
tia,
Jacob Anawalt
