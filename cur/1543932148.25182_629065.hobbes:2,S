(Sorry to show up so late...  It has been a bit crazy of late...)
The __acquire(RCU) and rcu_read_acquire() are strictly for the benefit
of sparse -- they allow it to detect mismatched rcu_read_lock() and
rcu_read_unlock() pairs.  (Restricted to a single function, but so
it goes.)
I don't claim to fully understand this code, so may be way off base.
However, it looks like you are relying on stop_machine(), which in
turn interacts with preempt_disable(), but -not- necessarily with
rcu_read_lock().  Now, your rcu_barrier() call -does- interact with
rcu_read_lock() correctly, but either you need the preempt_disable()s
to interact correctly with stop_machine(), or you need to update the
comments calling out dependency on stop_machine().
Or it might be that the RCU API needs a bit of expanding.  For example,
if you absolutely must use call_rcu(), and you also must absolutely
rely on stop_machine(), this might indicate that we need to add a
call_rcu_sched() as an asynchronous counterpart to synchronize_sched().
This would also require an rcu_sched_barrier() as well, to allow safe
unloading of modules using call_rcu_sched().
Or am I missing something?
