I did kick it off, but I've not had the time recently to go through and
find all the others; yes, there are a lot of them around in the kernel
tree.  The main problem anyone will face with this is that a lot of people
remember when there wasn't a zero initialised bss in the kernel, and
the tendency to initialise to zero has become a habbit, or is left in
some ancient documents that new people read.  But whatever the reason,
patches still get generated which add code with explicit zero initialisers.

Probably the best thing to do would be to send them to linux-kernel,
other relevent mailing list or maintainer (see MAINTAINERS/CREDITS file)
in small per-file chunks and copy them to Linus.

Yes.  Anything that does into __initdata by definition has to be initialised,
so there will be some zero initialisers left over.
