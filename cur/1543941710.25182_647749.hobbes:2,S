I think you're missing my point: as long as the license stays the way
it is now, you can never distribute proprietary code unless you've
consulted a lawyer and even then you run the risk of being sued for
infringement if the copyright holder thinks what you have is derived
work. The GPLv2 and thus Linux was never designed to allow proprietary
code and arguing that is pointless, isn't it? There are much better
alternatives available and people interested in proprietary code
should be looking there.
