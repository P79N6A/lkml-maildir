I'm not totally against it, it's just that it has some issues:
 - naming policy in general. Trivially handled by just always calling
   the special node something truly boring and nautral like "node", and
   be done with it. The _path_ is the real name, the "node" would be
   just an openable entity.
 - the issue of persistent permissions and ownership. 
The latter is the real problem.  And I personally think the only sane
policy is to just let "/sbin/hotplug" handle it, which definitely
implies _not_ having the kernel create the real device node. That way
user-space can have any policy it damn well pleases, including having
some default heuristics along with "a priori known nodes".
But clearly that user-space hotplug entity needs to know major and minor
numbers in order to create the real device node, and that's where the
"node" thing may be acceptable - as a template, nothing more.  Although
I suspect that there are other, simpler and more acceptable templates
(ie export the dang thing as just a "node" text-file, which describes
the majors and minors and "char vs block" issues)
