Forgive my poor mastery of the english language and me letting slip
this inconsistency.
The first sentence you cited was a general remark IMO valid outside
of this context and possibly ill placed as it was.
The second sentence pertains the key msg I was trying to deliver and
apparently I did a poor job in phrasing it so let me redo it:
Why would I want to change the SW targetted for some HW if I can't run
the changed version on said HW ?
[note that for the TiVo case I possibly would not own or be able to own
similar HW being able to run my modified SW; so even some HW would not
be triggered either]                                 ^^^^
Remember I'm discussing my understanding of the spirit of the GPL,
not whether the legal part actually does give me that right enforceable
in court.
Here is another stmt which is valid outside of this context AFAIAC:
If the GPLv2 does not legally give me the right that I think its spirit
gives me then the legal phrases should be changed to achieve that.
Whether or not others share my view of what the spirit of the GPL
implies is completely theirs to decide and if they differ they likely
won't agree on my previous stmt either. Fine with me.
And this leads to another observation:
IMO this thread is partly fueled by a fundamental mixing of PoVs.
Some argue based on their perceived view of the spirit of the GPL
and some based on the actual legal phrases in GPLv2 and GPLv3 and
whether or how they reflect the perceived spirit.
Best wishes,
Michael
