To complement this, running Solaris' /usr/{ccs,xpg4}/bin/make and BSD's
portable make (just bootstrap www.pkgsrc.org to obtain "bmake" on Linux)
is probably a much better approach since it tests real-world make
implementations rather than an artificial and not widely available local
flavor.

Proof sketch: Compile Linux without SCSI subsystem and see if
cdrecord dev=/dev/hdc still works.

The other scenario is that nobody but you has problems
developing/porting SCSI applications to Linux, or nobody but you has
problems formulating useful bug reports. Holding on to 1999 bug reports
that you cannot dig up doesn't work without paid support contract,
as you've seen.
