Thanks for the thourough testing. I've reviewed the code, and the only
think that looks weird to me is the case where smp_sanity_check() fails.
The attached patch is an attempt to correct this, Tetsuo, could you
test it?
Ingo, could you please have a look at it? It does what commit
deef325086c3897393b8f7d6bccd0340 "x86: disable preemption in
native_smp_prepare_cpus" was looking to fix, but continuing the APIC
setup in case smp_sanity_check fails.
Regards,
Frederik
