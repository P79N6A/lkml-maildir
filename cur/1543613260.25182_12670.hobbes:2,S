Subject: 2.5.1-pre10: drivers/ide/ide-tape.c compile error

Hello all,
   I haven't seen this posted yet. While a 'make modules' on 
2.5.1-pre10, I received the attached compile error on 
drivers/ide/ide-tape.c . I noticed this with 2.5.1-pre9 as well. I don't 
recall seeing it with 2.5.1-pre7, and I'm using the same .config .
Regards,
Frank
