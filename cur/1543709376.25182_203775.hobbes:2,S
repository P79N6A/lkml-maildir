Not a stupid question at all. Despite the recent announcement, 
efi is still working its way into x86 systems.  I think that 
decision lies with OEMs.  I believe some are already out there...

Not necessarily, although some systems (such as servers) will 
indeed have support for x86-64.  I've just started looking at what 
support needs to added for x86-64, in terms of efi, since I 
learned about the announcement via cnet as well...  ;-(
