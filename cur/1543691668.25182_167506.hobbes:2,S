I would argue that any JVM that doesn't yet implement
JVMPI_EVENT_COMPILED_METHOD_LOAD is broken - JVMPI has been around for a
long time now.
I don't see why the kernel is the correct place to fix such lacking
functionality.

Please be specific about which *actual* cases you're worried about, and
why they shouldn't be fixed in userspace.

Simply flush the sample buffer by echo 1 >/dev/oprofile/dump when you
receive a COMPILED_METHOD_LOAD/UNLOAD that conflicts with a previous
mapping.
