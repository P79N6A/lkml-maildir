there is a bunch of tools able to get a html file and to pipe it. but 
a pipe isnt the same thing that a file.
ex: i have a program and his command line requires a list of file
and i want one of them as "http://.." or "/http/.." (choose the one
you prefer). a pipe cant satify this case.
for PUT, write() seems ok.
for POST,... i dunno :) what is the purpose of the POST command ?
