But correctness is no more upset here than with any other reason that
the page gets COWed.

So we should still solve it for once and for all just by turning off
COW completely.

Well I think that we should have a flag that just prevents copy
on write from ever happening. Maybe that would mean it be easiest
to implement in mmap rather than as madvise, but that should be
OK.
