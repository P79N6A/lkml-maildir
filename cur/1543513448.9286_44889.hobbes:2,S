In August the story was "I won't accept drivers with kernel-compatibility
defines" and "put the very latest versions into the 2.3 kernels, or they
won't get into 2.4".  I did that with the "2.3" series drivers, which were
the very latest (test, not "release" versions) at the time.

From my side, I send an updated driver, you report "it didn't work for
someone" (and that person never sent a problem report to the driver mailing
list), and it doesn't go in.
I'm trying to save you work, and have a broader early-test base, by having a
separate test process that doesn't require people to update to the latest,
probably-broken development kernel.  You should *expect* that a driver has a
three or six month old date on it.

I'm running 50 eepro100 interfaces in a cluster with the new driver. The
old driver in the kernel has known bugs.  The mailing list is active.

I'm the one that has to sort out the bug reports of "version 1.23" with "do
you mean v1.23 of two years ago with five random patches that aren't in my
CVS tree, or with only four random patches".
