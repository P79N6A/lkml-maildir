i386 disabled it because there were claims that it increased stack size
too much, but I haven't seen any real evidence for that. That is why I never
added it to x86-64. On the other hand it tends to shrink text size considerably.
I think it should be reevaluated and enabled by default on i386 again.
BTW there is a patch pending for gcc 4.3+ that prevents optimizations
that increase stack size unduly. Not sure it has been added there yet,
but that was the right fix for these problems anyways.
