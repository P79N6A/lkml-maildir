 Sorry. Since it is small I'll simply split class-casts+release.diff and
 attach both pieces just in case.

 Making a directory for a single source file seams a little overkill,
 although at some point could be interesting to have all firmware images
 in the kernel on the same directory to be copied to initramfs or
 elsewhere.
 For now I don't think it is worth it's own directory, but I don't
 really care as long as the functionality is there.
 If I had to choose I would take drivers/base/firmware/
 Thanks

Let us have the serenity to accept the things we cannot change, courage to
change the things we can, and wisdom to know the difference.
