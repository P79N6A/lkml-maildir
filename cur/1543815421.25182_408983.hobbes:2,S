I disagree with this philosophy seeing as how it is possible to create 
these files from within windows itself:
echo foo > \\?\c:\aux.h
dir *.h
  Volume in drive C has no label.
  Volume Serial Number is F064-30D6
  Directory of C:\
03/21/2006  10:07a                   6 aux.h
                1 File(s)              6 bytes
                0 Dir(s)   4,584,951,808 bytes free
Creates a file named aux.h in c:\ just fine.  Under win2k at least, 
explorer only hangs when I try to click on the file.  Explorer has 
always done really stupid things like this though.  I remember when 95 
first came out we could create files with high ascii names on the server 
like ascii 255, and explorer would happily render it as an underscore 
(_), but could not open it or delete it because it was actually trying 
to access a directory named "_" rather than ascii 255.
Just because explorer/the win32 api is stupid doesn't mean linux should 
be too.
