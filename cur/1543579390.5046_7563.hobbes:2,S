Kernel mods are less drastic than a system call? :^)
Reading the documentation for sched_setscheduler, it's unclear whether
it would even suffice - it seems to deal with preempting other
processes. I am not trying to get into the run queue ahead of other
processes, the machine is sitting there IDLE and my process is still not
getting to run for a full clock tick.
You know, there's one other possibility, and that's if the data that is
being sent isn't actually arriving until the next clock tick, which
means the delay is in the appearance of sent data, not in select().
Given that the two processes are on the same machine, I would expect a
send() on a TCP socket to deliver the data to its destination faster
than that, however.
