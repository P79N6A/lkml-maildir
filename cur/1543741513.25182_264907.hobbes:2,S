Well, as Alan mentioned, there are already five 3D chipsets out there 
with docs going to anyone who is serious about implementing a 3D driver 
for that particular piece of hardware.  You need more than just 
available docs and hardware.
You need...
* engineering resources to implement a complicated driver (3D h/w 
drivers are complex beasts)
* a compelling design and/or [low] cost
* to avoid the problem where the h/w changes so often, the open source 
driver maintainers simply cannot keep up.
