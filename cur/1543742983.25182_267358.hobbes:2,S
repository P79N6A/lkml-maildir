What about all those "multimedia" and "Internet" keyboards out there?
Plus I don't think using DMI is a good idea. Many people use 2 keyboards
with their laptops - built-in and external and DMI mapping will sure be
wrong for external keyboard. Theoretically it should be possible to have
several completely independent keyboards (at least as far as keycodes go).
I actually would love to set up X to have 2 keyboards with 2 different
layouts, I wonder if event keyboard driver can help here... And we'd have
to adjust setkeycodes too...
