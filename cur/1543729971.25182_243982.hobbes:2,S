Thanks - I get that :)
The 'write' point is that from a data perspective you've already lost 
your data (which is the most valuable thing from a security perspective).
I agree it's nice to give people write access to hardware and not let 
them melt it permanently. However, if the semantics don't allow 'safe' 
writing then prevent all user writing and use setgid for safe programs 
(which is essentially what you are doing anyway) to allow users to write.
So, the real point: principle of least privilege.
Why root? why not set[gu]id cdwriters?
