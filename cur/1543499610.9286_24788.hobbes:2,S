Hi,
   While perusing the linux-kernel mailing list archives, I came across
   a message of yours regarding 2.2.x kernel problems. (I'm not a kernel
   hacker, and don't subscribe to the mailing list).
   I've been having problems with 2.2.10 while debugging some code of mine.  
   In my attempts to isolate the cause (at the luser, not the kernel, level :)), 
   I found that a little program (included below) will crash my machine
   every time. Typically, the crashes happen within 10 minutes of
   launching the program. (The crashes seem to happen sooner if I 
   also launch a big application like netscape).  
   This may or may not be related to the problems you've been having,
   but I think it's definitely worth looking into.  Hopefully, some
   other folks can replicate the symptoms I'm seeing.
   I haven't tried this with other 2.2.x kernels, but will do so when I
   have the time.
   Until this problem surfaced, I had been running my machine nearly 24x7
   for over a year with no crashes/flakiness, with both 2.0.x and 2.2.x
   kernels.
   I'm not sure who's the best person to send this to -- Alan Cox,
   Stephen Tweedie, et.al. are probably buried in email, so I'm
   reluctant to add anything else to their in-boxes.  Anyway, if you 
   know of any other folks who'd like to look into this, could you pass
   this message along to them? 
   FWIW, I'm running Debian 2.1 on a single-cpu pentium-II machine.
   If anyone's interested, I can provide more information (.config
   file, ksymoops output, etc..)
                                            --Thanx,
                                                      Ross Myers
