What is done for bypassing the cache when the size of a file lock held
by the
reading/writing process is not a multiple of the caching granularity?
Consider
two different clients with processes sharing a file and locking 2k byte
regions
of the file and possibly updating these regions.  Suppose that each
system caches
4k byte blocks.  If system A locks the first 2k of a block and system B
locks
the second 2k, the updates from one of the systems may be lost if these
systems
cache the writes.  This is because each system will write back the 4k
block it
cached, not the 2k block that was locked.
