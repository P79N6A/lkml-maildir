You don't want  good Longhorn support, as currently  at least Longhorn
still uses  the proprietary GDI 2D drawing  algorithms, and DirectDraw
in rare cases.  MacOS/X does  the drawing and effects in OpenGL, which
is what  you want.  As  will X.Org.  So  you want OpenGL  support, and
you'll be done. (Once framebuffers  are being drawn in OpenGL as well,
which isn't impossible to happen.)
Maybe we'll need a graphics card that does OpenGL *only*...
