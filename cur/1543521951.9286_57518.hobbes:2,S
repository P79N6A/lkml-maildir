     I thought I remembered seeing something here a while back about a utility
to make large swap partitions.
     I'm running into a bit of a problem related to swap, according to the man
page for mkswap:
       The MINCOUNT and MAXCOUNT values for a swap area are:
              MINCOUNT = 10 * PAGE_SIZE / 1024
              MAXCOUNT = (PAGE_SIZE - 10) * 8 * PAGE_SIZE / 1024
       For  example,  on a machine with 4kB pages (e.g., x86), we
       get:
              MINCOUNT = 10 * 4096 / 1024 = 40
              MAXCOUNT = (4096 - 10) * 8 * 4096 / 1024 = 130752
     However, on a Sun 4/670MP, which is sun4m architecture and I thought was
8k pages; it will not let me make a swap partition bigger than 130752k as if it
has 4k pages when it should let me make 523648k swap partitions.  Eight of
those would just about get me where I need to be on this particular machine. 
     I've got 2.2.14 on this box, can anybody tell me what I've got to do to
make bigger than 130MB swap partitions?  Thanks. 
     If I need a newer, bigger, better utility, where to get it would also be
appreciated.
