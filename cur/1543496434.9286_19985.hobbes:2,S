I want to have this:
The generic loopback. That make is possible to write emulators and debugger for
any device. And features like a disk activity monitor and so on.
And a security feature we can call enuc, which is a more generic version
of change root. A prcesses shuld be able to give a way its rigths to call any
systemcall. The processes for example say:I m sure, I will not need to create
any more sockets, child processes or what ever. This should give all the
stack smashers a very hard time.
