I'm sure you'll find the average RTC is off by significantly more than
a second anyway. _Or_ is regularly synced over network.

Depends. Do you need sub-second precision on your wall time? If you're
currently depending on your RTC (not to mention the rest of the kernel
timekeeping system) to give you time of day that matches actual time
to fractions of a second without regular synchronization, you're
kidding yourself. 
All my machines seem to grow out of sync by about a minute per week if
ntpd stops running. That's almost a half second per hour.

I considered that and decided it wasn't worth the effort. People who
care (which ought to be the empty set) can run /sbin/hwclock.
