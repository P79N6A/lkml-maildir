Yes, but if there's no API in the kernel code allowing to obtain page 
pointers using any value returned from dma_alloc_coherent(), then we 
cannot fix this problem.
So, it's not much subsystem (ALSA) problem, but kernel core is not matured
enough.
The same problem is for the cache coherency for mmaped pages.
