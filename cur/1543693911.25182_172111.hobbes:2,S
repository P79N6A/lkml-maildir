Well damn, I must have looked at that a hundred times when wondering why
/proc/vmstat:pginodesteal was always zero.  Thanks.
It would probably be worthwhile teaching the compiler to generate a warning
in this case; I doubt if anyone is likely to want to find out at runtime
whether the linker happened to place a particular function at address zero.
I shall suggest that.
