Indeed. Unfortunately it is orthogonal to the line length limit.
We should limit the nesting level, though I think there is no
universally good value. What is good for one case (a function with a
short multi-level if/for/etc) is bad for another (a long switch()
where any added complexity makes it unparseable).
So I think it just have to meet the author's and reviewers' taste. We
already depend on this.
