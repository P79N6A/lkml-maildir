Well getting firmware out of them tends to be up and down.
However I just looked through the QLogic v4.27 provided driver from
their web site and it does in fact included firmware with a GPL
license.
Dave, if you want to play with this and stick it into the qlogicfc.c
driver then you will at least have something that sorta works for now
(module all the other problems with that driver).
http://www.qlogic.com/bbs-html/csg_web/adapter_pages/driver_pages/22xx/22linux.html
They do have a stupid 'read and agree' license in front of that page
if you go in via the official qlogic.com door, however if the code
inside is GPL then I asume it's GPL.
Cheers
Jes
