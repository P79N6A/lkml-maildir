Hi Martin and linux-kernel readers,
receiving my previous mail myself did give me another view to it and now
I am curious why it did work that fine with following typo present:
> +       val |= newval << (3*(pirq*1));
it should read:
   val |= newval << (3*(pirq-1));
With this changed it still works with the PCMCIA card, but I still need
to gain access to a CardBus card to test it with.
Michael
