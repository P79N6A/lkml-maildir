Well, judging by the fact that pretty much 99.9% of all users won't ever
care about the return value. And coupled with the fact that the current
behaviour is compatible with BSD (except for the BUG_ON() that I added,
and I have no idea what BSD does for that case, since it pretty clearly
_is_ a bug), I definitely prefer having standard return values than trying 
to make it "easier".
The BSD return values do actually make sense for nested operations.
