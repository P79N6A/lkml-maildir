  Hi, all. Version 4 of my msr patch is now available from:
http://www.atnf.csiro.au/~rgooch/linux/kernel-patches.html
Some documentation is also available here.
The patch provides user space access to Model-Specific Registers (MSRs)
and Performance Monitoring Counters (PMCs) via device driver interfaces.
This is against 2.2.0+devfs. Highlights of this release:
- Included experimental page colouring for x86 (other arch's will
  follow when people tell me how to find out L2 cache size). Page
  colouring is enabled via an ioctl() on /proc/<pid>/mem
				Regards,
					Richard....
