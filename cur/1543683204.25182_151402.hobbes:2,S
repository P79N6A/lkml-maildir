Hi all,
I forward to the lkml a mail I posted on kernelnewbies hoping someone of 
you can help me.

Hi,
for a couple of weeks I worked on some examples about boot process. In 
my previous post on kernelnewbies I post some of them.
Now I have a problem. My goal is to boot from a diskette, load the setup 
code (4 sectors), load the kernel at 0x10000 and move it at 0x1000 
trying to execute a main C routine that
should represent the start of the kernel. This C routine print simply 
"Hello Kernel".
For my job I used the examples of Berlin Brown at 
http://bama.ua.edu/~brown084/main.html
  because this code is a 
simplified version of the linux boot process.
Attached there is my code, hoping someone of you can give a look at it 
and tell me if there is something wrong (I think so).
Before the jump to 0x0100 all seems work fine. The problem happen when I switch in 
protected mode and try to jump to 0x0100.
Ahhhh!!! I use bochs for my test.
PS
To build my code type:
make clean (when necessary)
make all
to write on a diskette:
make disk
