Subject: [patch 0/8] PCI Error Recovery patchset
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

What follows is a set of patches to implement a PCI error recovery
system.  Some (newer) PCI controllers are able to detect and report 
PCI errors, these patches enable this hardware function.
-- the first patch adds documentation, explaining what this is and how
   it works.
-- the next patch adds core infrastructure to include/linux/pci.h
-- the next several patches add recovery support to three ethernet and
   two scsi drivers.
-- the last patch is a big monster that implements the recovery
   driver for the ppc64-specific pci controllers.
The first seven patches should apply cleanly to just about any recent
kernel tree; the last patch requires GregKH's pci patchset, since some
ppc64 functions changed recently.
