That's why it's important to be irritating but not obnoxious.  The
difference is that between reminding people that there is work to be done
and being insulting about it.  Thus, I post lists of symbols for which
there is missing help, but I don't cast aspersions on the people who
haven't come through yet (however tempting that sometimes seems).
I also find it helpful to be up front about *why* I'm being irritating,
just as I'm doing now.  When people understand that it's professional
rather than personal, they don't tend to killfile me.
