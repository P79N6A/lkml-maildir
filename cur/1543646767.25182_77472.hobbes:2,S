Somebody already did, there is a backend somewhere that accesses RCS
archives as files through the Coda kernel module. Besides Coda clients
and servers have 'versioning' to detect conflicts, and have a convenient
'OldFiles' directory with the backup volume with yesterday's files. By
increasing the backup interval that could f.i. be the files you had an
hour ago.
The only reason why I think this doesn't affect the license is because
these solutions are not 'competing' with BK (yet) so they don't trigger
the "don't piss off Larry" clause...
I'm expecting that all the BK->gnu patch gateways will be shut down in
about 5 years, which should be around the time that other systems
(perhaps subversion) come in the 'competing with BK' stage. Because at
that point they are aiding in the wider deployment and development of
the competing version control system.
