It's an incredibble bandwidth waste for 99.99% of people downolading 
2.5.xx and it *is* making architectural
changes in the kernel harder, becouse the modularisatoin of the kernel 
isn't nearly as perfect as you try
to disguise it here. Please just have a look at the consequences of the 
kdev_t changes, which where necessary
since already about 8 years. And then my these is somehow tautological 
if it doesn't apply now, it will
apply in about 4 years. At some point in time there is the need to let 
some things go - the problem
is more fundamental.
