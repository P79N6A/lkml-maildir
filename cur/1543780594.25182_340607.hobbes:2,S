I added preempt_*able around radeon_probe_i2c_connector, and now I get the 
output from below and still no sync. Obviously you shouldn't msleep in 
preempt-disabled code. I'll try voluntary preemption, but that will at 
best hide the error.
Maybe I can mess with the msleep()s like thorndike's cat, but any success 
will be an accident.

It is still called paranoia when they really are out to get you.
