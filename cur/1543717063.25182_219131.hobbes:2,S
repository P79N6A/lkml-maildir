Subject: [PATCH] rmap 29 VM_RESERVED safety
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/5/8/94

From: Andrea Arcangeli <andrea@suse.de>
Set VM_RESERVED in videobuf_mmap_mapper, to warn do_no_page and swapout
not to worry about its pages.  Set VM_RESERVED in ia64_elf32_init, it
too provides an unusual nopage which might surprise higher level checks.
Future safety: they don't actually pose a problem in this current tree.
