We are now moved to vger.kernel.org based OMAP list, so removing old
list. Your kernel version looks very old. Could you please try the
kernel from OMAP GIT. You can find instructions at
http://www.muru.com/linux/omap.
 GIT tree is at
http://source.mvista.com/git
 and also at 
http://www.kernel.org/git.
