Well that does look like a pretty good cleanup. It certainly is
the final step in freeing complex architecture switching code
from entanglement with scheduler internal locking, and unifies
the locking scheme.
I did propose doing unconditionally unlocked switches a while
back when my patch first popped up - you were against it then,
but I guess you've had second thoughts?
It does add an extra couple of stores to on_cpu, and a wmb()
for architectures that didn't previously need the unlocked
switches. And ia64 needs the extra interrupt disable / enable.
Probably worth it?
Minor style request: I like that you're accessing ->on_cpu
through functions so the !SMP case doesn't clutter the code
with ifdefs... but can you do set_task_on_cpu(p) and
clear_task_on_cpu(p) ?
Thanks.
