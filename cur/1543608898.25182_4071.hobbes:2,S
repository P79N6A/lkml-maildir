I tried to boot my kernel using the serial console, using the
console=ttyS0,115200 (it does the same thing with 9600) ... it work great
until :
Freeing unused kernel memory: 36k freed
serial console detected.  Disabling virtual terminals.
console=/dev/ttyS0
At this point the output of the serial line slow down dramaticly ... almost
to a halt ... I get 1 line every 30 seconds !!!
why is this slow down occuring ? the part which is 100% kernel is going fast
and ok, but when it become console related ... it slows down ?
thak you

If you can see it, but it's not there, it's virtual. 
If you can't see it, but it is there, it's hidden. 
It you can't see it and it isn't there, it's gone.
