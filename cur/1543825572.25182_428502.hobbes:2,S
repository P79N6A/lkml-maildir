Indeed (fixing ".irq_handler" to be ".handle_irq"), with that change
MSI-X works fine with ib_mthca on my system.  The only slightly funny
quirk is that the IRQ type is shown as "PCI-MSI-X-<NULL>", I guess
because it's printing handle_irq_name(NULL).
However (as BenH pointed out) there's definitely some work to do to
untangle MSI...
