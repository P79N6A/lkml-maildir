Thats because the scheduled work became empty before it was executed.
        --  BUG_ON(!list_empty(&work->entry)); --
Looks like someone forgot to flush_scheduled_work() before exiting. Can you 
try putting flush_scheduled_work() as the first line in cp2101_exit and 
whatever is the exit function of io_edgeport?
Just a wild guess. Things might be more complicated than this, but no harm in 
trying.
