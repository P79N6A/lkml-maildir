And at this point, I can't tell.  This reboot was from a cold start, without 
the argument, and cold by long enough to make the rounds about the house and 
pick up a beer, but not take my evening pillbox.  A minute cold, maybe 2 max.  
The log is clean since except for a kudzu nag of some sort:
[   50.535388] warning: process `kudzu' used the deprecated sysctl system call 
with 1.23.
which isn't your problem, but fedora's.
As I said before, that error has not returned since the first time I used that 
argument, and I have booted several times now without it.  Uptime now is just 
over an hour though, so I'm not taking bets just yet. :)
