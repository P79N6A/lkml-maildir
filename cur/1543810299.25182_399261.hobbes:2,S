With 2.6.16-rc4 on my laptop, I seem to be getting a lot of the following 
spewed onto the console.  It's not reproducible on demand, but seems to be 
related to multi-key press/release sequences when banging away a bit too 
quickly...

atkbd.c: Unknown key released (translated set 2, code 0x7f on isa0060/serio0).
atkbd.c: Use 'setkeycodes 7f <keycode>' to make it known.
