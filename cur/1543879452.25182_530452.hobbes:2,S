I was just thinking about this the other day.  I did an inventory of
the actual _users_ of this code when I added the deprecation to Kconfig,
and the only driver that would catch the notification was for some
old m68k platform serial driver (Amiga?) ... that won't have changed.
So the only reason not to remove it at that time was to make sure that
folk had a chance to squawk about it going away.  I think it's past
time for this ancient stuff to vanish, since it's been obsolete for
most of 2.5..2.6 and there's only that one event consumer left.
Go for it!
