I'm willing to take over this work if you really want
to throw in the towel.  It has to be done, simply to
make Linux better able to deal with load spikes.

Agreed, the slight to medium overcommit needs to be
addressed well.  This is way more important than very
highly overcommitted systems, because computers are
powerful enough for their workloads anyway.
The thing Linux needs to deal with are unexpected
load spikes.  The thing that needs to be done is
making sure that such a load spike doesn't send
Linux into a death spiral.
If such a load control mechanism also solves the
highly overloaded scenario, that's just a nice
bonus.

Under light to moderate overload, a load controlled system
will be more responsive than a thrashing system.
Heavy overload is probably a "docter, it hurts ..." case.
