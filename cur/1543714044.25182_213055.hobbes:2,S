Subject: [PATCH] drivers/char/KConfig: Remove "BROKEN_ON_SMP" tag on CYCLADES entry

Hi Andrew, 
The cyclades.c driver was marked BROKEN_ON_SMP during early 2.6. It was fixed later
on but the tag was left in Kconfig.
The driver is not very smart wrt SMP locking, it can be improved. There is only 
one spinlock percard which guarantees command block ordering and protects different
shared data, which can be held for long periods.
_But_ the locking works reliably, so remove the BROKEN_ON_SMP tag.
Please apply.
