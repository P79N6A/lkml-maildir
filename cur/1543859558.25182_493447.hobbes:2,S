Yes, of course. The odd one here is glibc.
Normal systems enable everything by default. As soon as you
specify a feature define, you get ONLY what you asked for.
I'm not sure why glibc is broken, but I suspect that somebody
wants to make everyone declare their code to be GNU source.
(despite many "GNU" things not working on the HURD at all)
Define _APPLE_C_SOURCE to make MacOS X give you everything.
