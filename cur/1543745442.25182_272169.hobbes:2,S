ksymoops can disasemble the entire code line, but starting at different 
offsets (up to the maximum instruction length) from the start. the first 
disassembly to include the program counter in the output would be deemed 
correct.
this would work for all architectures, and might improve reliability for 
i386.
in case I'm not communicating well:
for (offset = 0; offset < max_instr_len; ++offset) {
    create_object_file(code + offset, len - offset);
    disassemble();
    if (disassembly_includes_eip())
        break;
}
the likelyhood of the first section containing garbage is reduced; and 
the code works for VLI and FLI.
