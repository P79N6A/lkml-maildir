Subject: SGI to be involved in core kernel development?

I just ran into this interesting article at linuxtoday.com.  ( See:
http://www.news.com/News/Item/0,4,39942,00.html?owv
 ) Here is an
excerpt:
"You're really caught in a bind how much value you can add to the NT
operating system," because Microsoft controls the development, Silverman
said. SGI hopes to stand out from the crowd by making its Intel servers
able to use dozens or even hundreds of processors, and for that, "you
need an operating system where you can actually muck around with the
kernel," he  said.
