Talking about reality:
Having perl on the box, or having to upload some special purpose
application on the box are both measures not that easy if you are
going to do a real breakin. (Read: write some buffer overflow stub)
But just echo sum stuff or therelike is
*much* easier. And then there is the capability stuff you could use
to prevent everybody from accessing the syscall interface.
You don't have much expierence with real break-ins. Don't you?
