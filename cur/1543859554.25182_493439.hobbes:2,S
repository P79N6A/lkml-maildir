The MAC uses some part of power, but FYI at least e1000 already does
phy power management when IF_DOWN, if wake on lan isn't enabled, smbus
isn't enabled, etc etc.  If we started using D3 power management its
possible a whole bunch of code would go away out of e1000.
Is there some reason why we can't have the OS just do the D3
transition for all drivers that register support?  I mean, this power
management using D states is actually driver *independent* and at
least way back in the day was supposed to be implemented for "OS power
management"
