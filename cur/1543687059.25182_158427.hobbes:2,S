That was another item in the recent thread about workqueues:  other 
kernel code is very suited to the workqueue API, but only needs one 
thread, not a thread per cpu.  Would be nice to have a JUST_ONE_THREAD 
flag to pass to create_workqueue().
I bet adding such a flag would help alleviate some of the "I have 1001 
kthreads on my 16-way" complaints ;-)
