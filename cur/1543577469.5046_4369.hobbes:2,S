Yes, it is rev 78, but I have at least 20 of these working on other
machines (Precision 620) for a long time now.  The difference in this
machine is the i850 chipset vs. the i810 in the 620.
This seems to be a problem of 3c59x making a successful call of
request_irq(), but nothing shows up in /proc/interrupts.  It sounds like
something is getting dropped on the floor somewhere else.
I will try the patched driver on Andrew's web site.
