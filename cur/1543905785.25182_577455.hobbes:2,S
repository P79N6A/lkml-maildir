Subject: sdio: enhance IO_RW_EXTENDED support

These three patches enhance the support for the SDIO IO_RW_EXTENDED command.
The block size of functions is managed and the I/O ops (sdio_readsb() etc) are
extended to handle arbitrary lengths of data (by using multiple commands).
I've not yet had a chance to test this stuff as I don't (yet) have the time to
write a Bluetooth Type-A driver so these are posted as an example of the sort
of API I'd expect.
