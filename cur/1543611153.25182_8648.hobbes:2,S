Just one thing: If we have lots of locked buffers due to reads we are
going to may unecessarily block writes, and thats not any good.
But well, I prefer to fix interactivity than to care about that one kind
of workload, so I'm ok with it.

I would like to see he interactivity problems get fixed on block layer
side first: Its not a VM issue initially. Actually, the thing is that if
you tweak VM this way you're going to break some workloads.
