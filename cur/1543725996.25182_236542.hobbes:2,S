PPPoE is not needed to crash the kernel. Plain vanilla 2.6.7 will crash
just fine without it, seems like bringing up an ipv6 tunnel is enough.
Then just
$ tracepath6 <your tunnel ipv6 endpoint>
from a remote host and the kernel panics without any entry in the syslog.
But there is a quick and easy workaround. If you modprobe ip6table_filter,
the kernel won't panic!
Also when the ip6table_filter is not loaded, the tracepath never succeeds,
so I guess the first packet crashes the box. On the otherhand when
ip6table_filter is loaded, the tracepath succeeds as expected.
