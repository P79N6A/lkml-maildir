Jean, the default string alignments GCC seems to insist on using are going
to screw you far more than the extra byte here or there ;->
I've measured close to 100K+ of fluff 0x00 pad bytes in a 2.6 kernel that
are due to GCC.  FWIW, a while ago I posted a small utility to measure this
grotesque wastage.
