The mechanism is in place, but the SCSI stack still needs a few changes
to pass down the correct errors. The easiest would be to pass down
pseudo-sense keys (I'd rather just call them something else as not to
confuse things, io error hints or something) to
end_that_request_first(), changing uptodate from a bool to a hint.
I can help get this done, it's not something that should hold up dm-mp
by any stretch.
