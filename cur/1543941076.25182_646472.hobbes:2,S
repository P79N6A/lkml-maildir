Do you know what kernel this problem was introduced in, or is this a
long standing problem?  Presumably the same is needed for jbd2?
Once we have some decent amount of testing going on with ext4, I think
it makes sense to merge the jbd2 changes back into jbd and return to
a single code base, since there is nothing in the jbd2 code that ext3
can't also work with (i.e. all of the changes are properly isolated
with compatibility flags and such).

(trivial) this can be moved back onto the previous line.

Same...
