So you can compile a i386 or i486 kernel with a 'C' compiler that was
built on a i686 machine. It took me a week to find the reason why
a kernel, configured to run on a 486 (or even 386) would crash on
the boot of a 486.

The memcpy and other routines are in the architecture-specific directories
in cases where processors offer certain advantages.
The only built-in I found used was abs().  It was the '486 killer.

Penguin : Linux version 2.3.13 on an i686 machine (400.59 BogoMips).
