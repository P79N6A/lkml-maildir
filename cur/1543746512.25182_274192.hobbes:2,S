Yup.  Pat then posted a patch which supposedly fixed it by placing
something like
	else if (CDROM_CAN(CDC_DVD_RAM))
		ret = 0;
in cdrom_open_write():

Jens' MRW patch also introduces a new function: cdrom_dvdram_open_write
(which, in turn, calls cdrom_media_erasable), CDROM_CAN(CDC_DVD_RAM)
check in cdrom_open_write() is assigned to it; which again is supposed
to fix it.

Which is truly a pity. Yes I can understand that a maintainer needs
to concentrate on new trees etc, but it's pity.  Especially hearing
the pre-recorded "Hey 2.6 already has it, upgrade to it" message is
always nice ;)
