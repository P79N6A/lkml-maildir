Oh, damn, need to fix my daily builder, should be ok for tomorrow. IN the
meanwhile, you can try : 
  
http://people.debian.org/~luther/d-i/images/2005-02-23/powerpc/netboot/vmlinuz-prep.initrd
This is a zImage.prep kernel with builtin initrd, you just put it somewhere
where you can boot it from, usually a tftp server.
