Well, the real difference is that the payload of the "message" is actually
the payload of the SCSI command or ELS/CT Request. Thus, the payload may
range in size from a few hundred bytes to several kbytes (> 1 page) to
Mbyte's in size. Rather than buffer all of this, and push it over the socket,
thus the extra copies - it would best to have the LLDD simply DMA the
payload like on a typical SCSI command.  Additionally, there will be
response data that can be several kbytes in length.

Agreed. In this use of netlink, there's not a lot of wins for netlink over
ioctls. It all comes down to 2 things: a) proper portable message definition;
and b) what do you do with that non-portable user space buffer pointer ?
