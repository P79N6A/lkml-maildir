Hey, I'm not in the middle of this because I don't understand who is right
and it's not my place to make that call.  I said "if Linus or Marcelo says
do it"  specifically for the case that there is some hanky panky going on.
On the other hand, it's perfectly possible that the wrong comment got 
stuck in there and if that's the case why shouldn't it get fixed?
