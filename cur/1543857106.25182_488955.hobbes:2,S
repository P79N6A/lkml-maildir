Let's recap on cmpxchg.
For CPUs with no atomic operation other than SWP, it is not lockless.
For CPUs with load locked + store conditional, it is expensive.
I've shown in the past that a generic implementation based around ll/sc
can be cheaply implemented using cmpxchg.  The reverse is *not* true.
If you want an operation for performance critical portions of the
kernel, please allow architecture maintainers the freedom to use their
best performance enhancements.
