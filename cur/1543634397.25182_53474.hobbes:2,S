Note.  Getting at all of the memory isn't impossible but you have
to allocate a very large posix shared memory segment, and page it
in and out of your address space.
But the only easy solution to this problem is a 64bit machine.  At an
address bit consumed every year or so we have 2 or 3 decades before we
will need to move to 128bit machines to resolve this issue yet again.
At least the situation now is better than with ems.sys and xmm.sys and
their kin the last time x86 hit an address space wall.  Though we are
a little bit out from the point where all machines are configured with
more memory than they can practically use.
