I agree. While the relevance of the USB spec to most people is exactly
0%, the relevance to the USB portion of the kernel is almost exactly 0%
as well. I'd much rather cater to the USB developers since they're the
people who will be looking at those names, not anyone else.
Nonetheless, the current naming is a bit confusing.

Hmm, good point.

I agree too.

This can also be used too, although I typically picture smaller
controllers when it comes to firmware, whereas software runs on more
general purpose controllers, like the ones people would find running
embedded devices and thusly this software.
Anyway, my opinion is that "target" is the best term to use.
