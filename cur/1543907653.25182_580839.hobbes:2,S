Subject: [patch] ipvs: force read of atomic_t in while loop

For architectures that don't have a volatile atomic_ts constructs like
while (atomic_read(&something)); might result in endless loops since a
barrier() is missing which forces the compiler to generate code that
actually reads memory contents.
Fix this in ipvs by using the IP_VS_WAIT_WHILE macro which resolves to
while (expr) { cpu_relax(); }
(why isn't this open coded btw?)

Just saw this while grepping for atomic_reads in a while loops.
Maybe we should re-add the volatile to atomic_t. Not sure.
