eww.
A schedule_timeout_uninterruptible(1) or even cpu_relax() would be less
sinful, but still unpleasant.
It's strange that the problem of kthread_stop(already_exitted_task) hasn't
occurred before.
Again: why is this so hard?  It shouldn't be.  Perhaps because loop is
using completions in bizarre ways where it should be using
wake_up_process(), wait_event(), etc.
