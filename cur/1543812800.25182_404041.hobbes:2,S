Yes, I'm using xawtv + overlay directly to the X display :0.0. Is better 
way to use it with some WM (KDE, Gnome, ...)?

On the mainboard is graphics card Intel 915. I have tryed it with i810 
(with / without DRI) and vesa driver. I have also tryed PCIE graphics 
card from ATI. In all of those cases the PC freeze and as well as if is 
in PCI slot only ONE tuner!
