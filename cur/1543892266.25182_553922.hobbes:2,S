It will kill the kernel, sorry.
The only way in which we can fix that is to allow kernel threads to preempt
rt-priority userspace threads.  But if we were to do that (to benefit the
few) it would cause _all_ people's rt-prio processes to experience glitches
due to kernel activity, which we believe to be worse.
So we're between a rock and a hard place here.
If we really did want to solve this then I guess the kernel would need some
new code to detect a 100%-busy rt-prio process and to then start premitting
preemption of it for kernel thread activity.  That detector would need to
be smart enough to detect a number of 100%-busy rt-prio processes which are
yielding to each other, and one rt-prio process which keeps forking others,
etc.  It might get tricky.
