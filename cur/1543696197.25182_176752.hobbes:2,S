Hello!
1. why is printk used without KERN_* makro?
   like '        printk("[ ");' (267), ide-scsi from 2.6.0test9, version 0.92
   (there are more examples)
2. is the command line hdx=ide-scsi still necessary?
   -> if not, we should update the help
   Can't we pass the options via module parameters (if it is a module) ?
   -> if yes, we should update the help
   -> if no, is it possible to implement it?
Nico
