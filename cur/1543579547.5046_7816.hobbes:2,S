I compiled the nicstar ATM nic driver.
The following happens :

Kernel panic: Attempted to kill init!
I see there are a lot of unsigned long in the driver and I suspect this
may be the cause.
Can someone tell me what happens ? 
Oh, right, it's a ev56a on a ruffian board, exact kernel is : 2.4.0-ac6
I hope I typed the oops message correctly, since no drive was mounted as
it happened. 
Have a nice day.
