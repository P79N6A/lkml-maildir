Ugh.

Although it should be better at not hurting the common case (no
contention), as f_setown() calls should be rare occurences in comparison
to normal SIGIO generation.

CAP_KILL was only previously used for sockets when calling F_SETOWN and
FIOSETOWN, and was not checked during delivery. The cleanup just brings
sockets into line with ttys, futexes and directories.  It may be a good
idea, but probably out of scope of this cleanup.
