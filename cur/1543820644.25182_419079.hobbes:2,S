Hello,
Recently I've come across a lot of problems with 3ware controller on Linux 
2.6.15.4. Everything is in the Thomas-Krenn SR2400 server running on Debian.
3WARE DEVICE:
driver: 1.26.02.001
model: 8006-2LP
firmware: FE8S 1.05.00.068
bios: BE7X 1.08.00.048
DISKS:
2x Seagate ST3300831AS SATA 300GB
I used tw_cli (AMCC/3ware CLI (version 2.00.03.013)) to create RAID1 unit. 
After running cfdisk raid degraded and it can't be rebuilded. 
Next I tried to make JBOD units for testing. A 3ware driver was compiled into 
the kernel and also as a module. 
ERRORS:
Apr 26 15:07:10 krenn kernel: 3w-xxxx: scsi2: Command failed: status = 0xc7, 
flags = 0xc, unit #0.

resetting card.
It looks like some incompatibility with driver. Cables and disks are new, no 
badblocks. Tommorow I will try to compile driver from 3ware website with 2.4 
kernel. 
Thanks in advance.
