>(cause this crap is getting pitched)
I gave Alan a patch to fix the problem where the OOM activates too early
(eg. when there's still plenty of swap and buffer memory to eat).  I don't
know whether this made it into the mainstream kernel, but from the sound of
it, it didn't.
I also did some work on the OOM killer itself (so that it tries to be more
intelligent about *what* it kills), and I'm fairly certain that didn't get
accepted.
If you like, I can post a patch containing these two fixes.
