Really? I bet there is a factor of 2 at least in that lot when you
put them together? (Depending on what you are running)
Remember the reason you are scrabbling around for this ancient machine
is to answer a question along the lines of 'is my program useable on a
.....' ?
Also you want to make sure you haven't made an assumption about an actual
feature (you left a cmov in somewhere? You assumed AGP? LBA block addressing
etc).
