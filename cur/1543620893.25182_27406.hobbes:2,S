Hi!
root@amd:/proc/driver/root/pci0/00:02.0# cat irq
11root@amd:/proc/driver/root/pci0/00:02.0#
root@amd:/proc/driver/root/pci0/00:02.0# cat power
0
root@amd:/proc/driver/root/pci0/00:02.0# cat resources
-> irq does not include newline while power does. Probably irq should
add a newline for consistency.
I briefly tested usb support in driver. You really should figure out
some name ;-).
