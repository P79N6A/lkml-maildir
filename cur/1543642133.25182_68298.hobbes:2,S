Right, but it will work with or without DMA, for some definition
of "work."  Or it should work, right?
The Sony DVD-ROM performs acceptably w/o DMA (FIC Sabre box w/
1Ghz Pentium, Intel chipset) although it runs faster and smoother
w/ DMA turned on.  Same observation w.r.t CD-ROM.  The LF-D210
(probably it's a D231, they all identify as D210 I think)
Do you know anyone who has gotten this particular drive to work?
Or for that matter if there are any troubles with the KT333
chipset?  I wouldn't be surprised if there are some interrupt
"issues" with KT333 because my plain old IDE performance was
not good under the stock 2.4.18-3 kernel ... it would do some
of the same things (lots of system time, temporary "pauses",
etc.).
I wouldn't mind a m/b change although most of the good
Athlon options are KT333, which probably doesn't
solve anything.  I *was* going to build a dual box with an
S2466 ... maybe I should reconsider doing that.
I am also having problems with the C-Media onboard audio +
ALSA (0.9 rc3) ... it hangs the system (totally) after playing
for a few seconds.  So that is another strike against this
particular h/w configuration.
