It looks like in ARM the cpu_idle() (and default_idle) get traced . So
for instance you'll get a situation when preemption is off, interrupts
are off, and then the cpu runs something like halt on x86. Then an
interrupt wakes up the cpu. 
I attached a patch that might fix the tracing. I tried to prevent the
tracing around when the cpu halts.
