That's pretty much what you get if you only apply the first two patches.  Sadly, you can't just pass a vma as you don't always have one when you are making the decision.  For example when a shm segment is being created you need to commit the memory at that point, but its not been attached at all so there is no vma to check.  That's why I went with an abstract domain.  These patches have been tested in isolation and do seem to work.
The other patches started out wanting to solve a second issue, the generality seemed to come out naturally.  I am not sure how important it is, but when we create a normal shm domain we commit the memory then.  For an hugetlb one we only commit the memory when the region is attached the first time, ie when the pages are cleared and filled.  Also we have no policy control over them.
In short I guess if we only are trying to fix the overcommit cross over between the normal and hugetlb, then the first two patches should be basically there.
Let me know what the decision is and I'll steer the ship in that direction.
