Subject: [PATCH] 3c59x and resume
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Here is a small patch tested with 2.4.18 and 2.4.19-pre4.
It was proposed by Andrew but not integrated in pre4.
The problem is when using the vortex driver and suspend/resuming the
machine. Without this patch the card id is each time greater. To resume
correctly this driver need the option enable_wol=1 but as-is it will
only be true for the first ID. You can enable it for the first 8 IDs
with enable_wol=1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1 but you can't do it for all IDs.
Said another way without this patch you can't suspend/resume more than
eight times your machine.
This is a fix for the most common use. The proper fix would be IMO to
keep a bitmap of used IDs but I don't know if it worsts it.
Also a fix would be to separate the suspend/resume functionality from
the wol functionality (wake up on lan).
Thanks,
Christophe
