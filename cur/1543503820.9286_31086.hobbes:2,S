Working.

What do you want here?  The interesting problem is reading from a disk at a
fixed rate, e.g. for display of video or for sound, but this seems
like a buffering problem more than anything else.  Writing data is only
a buffering problem. You are almost always better using a smart very
much non-rt file/ i/o system that does reordering, block aggregation,
extents, .... than going to raw hardware.  
In RTL we do:
                   RT task passes request to Linux process: either waits or does not 
                   Linux process does i/o
                   done
I can trivially implement an "I/O daemon" that will make this transparent, if there is a need.

On the way. Next week probably.
