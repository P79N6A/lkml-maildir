Been away from this for a while, but I do think this needs a comment.  The fact 
that it touches 36 files is tilted rather strongly in that a good number of 
those files are in the Document/* tree.  I.e. there is a rather larger amount of 
documentation.
As to the #ifdefs, I once worked on a kernel (HPUX if you must know) where you 
could NOT remove the debug stub and its bits.  Turns out the kernel began to 
depend on the code that was supposed to be debugging it.  I rather strongly try 
to avoid Heisenberg and the nasty thinks that arise from this sort of thing.  I 
think you will find that most of those #ifdefs are "#ifdef CONFIG_KGDB" so that 
it you turn it off it is just as if the patch was not done (save the configure 
script, of course).
There is also the attempt to make one patch cover several kernels (such as in 
the 2.4 case where we may have O(1) or not) and also the preempt or not AND at 
the same time, want to debug the preempt code.

Yes, I agree.  Some of this is caused by the need to work with a rather fixed 
interface to gdb.  We would, for example, like to tell gdb to flush its cache 
from time to time.  It would also be nice if gdb were to hint to us about what 
it was trying to do.  The single step over a break point comes to mind here, as 
does the function call set up.  Still, improvements can be made.
