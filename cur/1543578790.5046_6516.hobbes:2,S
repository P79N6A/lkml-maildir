No. The correct response to that is _already_ "You have a binary-only
module. Even in the kernel it was compiled against, you are not supported.
Goodbye".

This is a good thing, as long as it doesn't get in the way of real
functionality. We don't _need_ to make life easier for people running
binary-only modules. But if we can do it without making life harder for
real people, then that's nice.
