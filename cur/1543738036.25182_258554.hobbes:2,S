I'm not sure what a better fix would be though ... I think WIndows
doesn't bother entering a low power state at all in such cases.
Which seems particularly pointless for the typical USB controller,
which is probably idle at that point already, and which can't take
all that much longer to resume from D3hot than from D1.
But that part is peripheral to the thrust of this set of patches.
Do you think adding those two bits to per-device PM state
is basically a good way to introduce their wakeup capabilities
to the PM core?  Suggestions on the next step?

I'm not averse to enums, especially once sparse does good things
with them, but I still think that sort of change would just be nibbling
around the edges of a larger problem.  (Which should be addressed
by different patches making device power states/policies, like G0/D1
or "idle yourself", be types that are fully distinct from system power
states like G1/S3, and for which abuse creates compiler errors.)
