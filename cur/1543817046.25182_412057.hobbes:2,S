AIUI inode_ops are not globals, they are per FS.

That to me reads as:
"To avoid having to consider making security_ops non-global we will
force security modules to be container aware".
It also means you could not mix security modules that affect the same
operation different containers on a system. Personally I don't care, I
don't use them. But perhaps this inflexibility will bring problems later
for some.
I think it's a design decision that is not completely closed, but the
inertia is certainly in the favour of your position.
Sam.
