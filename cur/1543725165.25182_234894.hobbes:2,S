 Limitations / TODO List
 =======================
-- Perfctr settings are not inherited from parent to child at fork().
-  The issue is not fork() but propagating final counts from children
-  to parents, and allowing user-space to distinguish "self" counts
-  from "children" counts.
-  An implementation of this feature is being planned.
 - Buffering of overflow samples is not implemented. So far, not a
   single user has requested it.
