IMHO, what everybody agrees on, is that swap-prefetch has a positive effect 
in some cases, and nobody can prove an adverse effect (excluding power 
consumption).  The reason for this positive effect is also crystal clear:  
It prefetches from swap on idle into free memory, ie: it doesn't force 
anybody out, and they are the first to be dropped without further swap-out, 
which sounds really smart.
Conclusion:  Either prove swap-prefetch is broken, or get this merged quick.
Thanks!
