This is because gdb tries packet "C" first. If that fails, which is the case 
with kgdb, it falls back to packet "c". It doesn't need packet "C" for 
SIGTRAP as it's used for breakpoints and single stepping and shouldn't be 
delivered to a debuggee.
SIGSEGV has to be actually delivered to an application for it to die. A user 
has a choice of correcting a bug on the fly and let the application continue 
without segfaulting. It can tell gdb to continue the debugee without a 
signal. It doesn't apply in case of kernel, so it's not a bug. Kernel anyway 
"delivers" the signal, that is, continues with a panic once kgdb returns. We 
don't offer a user the choice of correcting a segfault on the fly.
