I don't see how CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU justifies its own existence.
This e-mail thread would have never happened if it were simply included
in CONFIG_SMP, always.
I agree, of course, that ACPI should never have had to work-around
this by selecting HOTPLUG_CPU.  But even though it is now done at
the right layer, I don't see why PM should have to
be bothered with selecting HOTPLUG_CPU either --
it should just come with SMP.
