Hi Jan,

The JSM driver is a "stripped" down version of the DGNC driver.
There is no "competition" between these 2 drivers.
They were always intended to work side by side with each other.
Both drivers will get all fixes/changes added to them at the same time,
since 90% of the driver code is the same.
The JSM driver was forced to be stripped down when being submitted
to the kernel sources, and many extended features removed as so to be
included into the kernel, as the extended features added special ioctls
and special /proc (/sys for 2.6) files.
Oddly enough, I have had a few of our customers come back to me, after
seeing some of the previous JSM threads about yanking the extended
features,
and I quote:

But this is neither here nor there, as Christoph has made it clear,
actual "Digi customers" don't matter.
I will let the chips fall where they will, and clean up the mess that
will soon be introduced into my driver world. =)
