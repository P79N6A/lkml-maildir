Here is the patch I used that allows my system to boot. If there is
anything more I can contribute to help create a better fix, please let me
know.  Without this patch, my system locks up on boot whenever I put a
drive on the ide3 or ide4 channels.  With this patch installed, the system
will boot successfully and I can reliably use the ide3 and ide4 attached
drives.  Andre, I am assuming your latest patch to 2.2.14pre12 does not
address this.
