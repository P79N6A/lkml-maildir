Thanks Andrea!  
The real problem for ext3 and reiserfs using writepages isn't the
transaction I thought, but the data=ordered buffer based writeback.  The
page lock and page writeback bit are critical to the writepages locking,
which we don't take when doing data=ordered writes.
Since we're fixing writepages, here's a much more minor fix.  When the
page has buffers, and fs blocksize is < then the page size, and file eof
falls in the second to last buffer in the page, we will goto
page_is_mapped, which doesn't zero the bytes past eof.
The fix is to move up page_is_mapped slightly.
