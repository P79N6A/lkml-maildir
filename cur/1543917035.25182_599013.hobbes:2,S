Charming.  They really say that, do they?  Where?  I find no such thing, 
and I looked.  I did find Open Groups SuS which, similar to SCO's UNIX, 
says:

I feel I've presented a good case that that it's a bug.  You made a 
somewhat rude counter-claim, which I don't ascribe to malevolence.  
You're simply disinterested.  Nobody else cares, so why expend effort on 
it, right?  I'll let it drop, but it is a bug.
