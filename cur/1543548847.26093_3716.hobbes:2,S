Both you and Martin told me to look as devfs. I had, but I looked again
to see what I had missed.
I had somehow missed that internally devfs allows majors and minors to
both be 16-bits. However, the interface to the kernel for this
information and thence to the user world is still looks to be the 16-bit
kdev_t; so exceeding 255 for your minor number would "bleed" onto your
major number and cause aliasing of devices in some cases. How bad the
effects would be, I don't know.
Thanks,
John
