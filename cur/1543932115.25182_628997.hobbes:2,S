I did a bit more work and investigation on this and it turns out I could
not read the mmio in kernel space because I had not done a
pci_enable_device_bars() on the device. I had never done this on x86 so
I didn't realize it was necessary.

The PCI_MMIO_BASE is a defined as:
> #define PCI_MMIO_BASE            (0x00040000)
This is define in the technical documentation as the offset to access
pci config space from the mmio. I am using this because I know what the
values should be so it provides a nice sanity check.

So after doing pci_enable_bars() I can now access this mmio region in
kernel space. However, if I try to mmap this into user space I still
receive the bus error. I am mapping this into user space using the
example for LDD which says to use the remap_pfn_range() function. I've
tested this on the x86 and it works as expected, however every time I
access the mmio from user space using the mips, I continue to get the
bus error I previously received in kernel space.
Any idea what I might be doing wrong? How can I access this from user
space?
Thanks,
Jon
