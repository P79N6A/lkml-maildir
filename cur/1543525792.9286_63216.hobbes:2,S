i am really interested and motivated to write an h323 support for linux.
i like to use the socket architecture with a new type for h323. it also
should support all codecs used for h323 including gatekeeper, mixer and
maybe gateway implementation for the kernel. but i have some problems:
there is already an implementation for openh323. i am not shure what the
programmers will use for implementations then.
because of the presence of openh323, the kernel developers might not
accept the implementation as it might fill the kernel with "obsolete"
code.
is it possible to register the socket family AF_H323 somewhere. (dunno
who has control of it.)
what i really need is lots of positive response from programmers that
are willing to write apps for it. for all technical problems i might
find lots of people then...
