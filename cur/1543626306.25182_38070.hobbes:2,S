Agreed, mostly. My experience is that users prefer system 
functionality that is accessible from a shell script, rather than 
requiring a source change to their app. The cua method, be it ever 
so broken on some platforms, is directly usable without programming 
to solve the most common issue - how do I get my app to talk to my 
3-wire RS-232 ports. 
Good to hear from you again.
