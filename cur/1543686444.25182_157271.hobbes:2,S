Not on my box. But since it has an ISA slot, you can add legacy serial ports.

Serial: 8250/16550 driver $Revision: 1.90 $ IRQ sharing disabled
ttyS0: autoconf (0x03f8, 00000000): iir=3 iir1=6 iir2=6 type=16550A
ttyS0 at I/O 0x3f8 (irq = 4) is a 16550A
ttyS1: autoconf (0x02f8, 00000000): iir=3 iir1=6 iir2=6 type=16550A
ttyS1 at I/O 0x2f8 (irq = 3) is a 16550A
ttyS2: autoconf (0x03e8, 00000000): iir=0 type=16450
ttyS2 at I/O 0x3e8 (irq = 4) is a 16450

If I remove the ASYNC_SKIP_TEST flag, I get
ttyS2: autoconf (0x03e8, 00000000): LOOP test failed (10) type=unknown
and only the 2 existing ports are detected! Thanks!
Why is the ASYNC_SKIP_TEST flag needed? Would it be safe to remove it for PPC,
or are there possible side effects?
