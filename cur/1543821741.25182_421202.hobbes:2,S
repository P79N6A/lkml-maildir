Hi Erik,
Even I tried loading sd_mod scsi disk driver; I am not able to see any SATA
disks.
When I cat /proc/scsi/scsi it shows:
Attached devices:
I believe there must be some low level driver for the SATA devices (eg:
mv_sata for Marvel SATA) which allows sd_mod to expose them as a scsi
devices?
I need a generic SATA driver to be used as replace of (eg: mv_sata) driver.
Please suggest.
Yogesh

If the disk behaves like a standard SATA disk the sd driver should work
just fine (like with any other SATA disk).

It comes free with your kernel source.
