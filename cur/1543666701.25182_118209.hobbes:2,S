ie loading from the same cacheline shows bad behaviour, most likely due to 
cache line exclusion. Does anybody have an original Pentium to see if I 
remember that one right?

Wow. There aren't many things that AMD tends to show the P4-like "big
latency in rare cases" behaviour.
But quite honestly, I think they made the right call, and I _expect_ that
of modern CPU's. The fact is, modern CPU's tend to need to pre-decode the
instruction stream some way, and storing to it while running from it is
just a really really bad idea. And since it's so easy to avoid it, you
really just shouldn't do it.
