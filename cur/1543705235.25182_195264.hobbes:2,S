Oh damn. Yeah, we don't allow you to even see the threads in this case (it
checks "pid_alive(task)". We don't want you to try to confuse things by 
opening files of processes that we think are dead.
For the case of trying to figure out sub-threads of a dead thread group
leader, that may actually be a bug.
Just for testing this, you might remove the check for
        if (!pid_alive(task))
                goto out;
in proc_pident_lookup() in fs/proc/base.c.
Ingo - comments? We really want the sysadmin to be able to find threads 
that have a dead group leader, and right now that seems to be impossible.
