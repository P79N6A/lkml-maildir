  Hi Darren,
  FWIW:
  I've been running you test program on my box under a stress-kernel
load and did not observe any failure as you describe, not even a max
latency overshooting the 100 us limit (max latencies in the 60~70 us).
  I even went to decrease PERIOD to 1 ms and still no failure. 
  I'm running rt20 with the futex priority based wakeup patch on
a dual 2.8 GHz HT Xeon box. All hardirq and softirq threads are at their
default priority.
  How do you generate the network load you mention? Maybe I could try at
least with the same load you're using.
  Sébastien.
