Hi Jens!
For doing benchmarks on the I/O-Schedulers, I thought it would be very
useful to disable the pagecache.
I didn't want to make it so complicated so I just mark pages as
not-uptodate, so they have to be read again. Another reason was, that I
wanted to keep the conditions as near to reality as possible.
Further I thought it would be useful, if you could turn the pagecache on
and off without rebooting the system.
I implemented a proc-fs entry "/proc/benchmark/pagecache" for this.
Probably this patch can be useful for anyone else, who wants to do  some
benchmarks on block-layer stuff.
And if not, I would appreciate if you could have a look on it.
