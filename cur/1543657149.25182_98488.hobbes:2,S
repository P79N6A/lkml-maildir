"Ditto"
Actually I have a bit more information.  Using both 2.5.5x (on NFS 
server) and 2.4.19/20, I get in dmesg, "kernel: RPC: garbage, exit EIO" 
and df reports zeroes across the board for NFS volumes.
Nothing fixes it, the NFS server has to be rebooted.  During one of 
these moments, I also noticed the NFS server had a non-fatal OOPS w/ 
rpc.kmountd.  Unfortunately I didn't save the OOPS.
