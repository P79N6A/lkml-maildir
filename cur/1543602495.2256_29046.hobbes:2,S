I have been told of people covering this destance by swin, I do not know
if it is true, but a seawolf told me that from USA to cuba should
be easier to go. :).
I was thinking to  Richelieau princip:
Fare una legge e non farla rispettare significa
autorizzare il contrario.
(sorry, unable to translate in english, it is something like if you say a
law, and you are not
forcing people to respect it, people are allowed by law to do the
countrary).
Do you think Americans are considering this moral aspect?
