i dont think so. perhaps if there was a name change (ie. the old option
name got invalid and deleted), then you get asked by 'make oldconfig'. If
it's still valid and the choice box gets extended then it doesnt get
picked up. It's not an option anyway i want everybody to pick immediately
without knowing the effect :)
