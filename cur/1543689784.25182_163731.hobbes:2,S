hi!
i've got some really odd behavior.. if i do:
ip tunnel add t12 mode sit remote 195.70.51.141 local 195.70.37.175 ttl 64
then ip link set t12 up i got:
RTNETLINK answers: No such device
it must be a bug, because i only get this if i have another 12 or more
tunnels added before this one.. and just with specific ip address, if i
change it or simply use ip tunnel add t12 mode sit remote 195.70.51.141,
then it's working..
this problem exists in 2.4.20, and .22; .21 is not tested..
is this a real bug? has anyone experienced it before?
thanks,
