Hmm. Yes, i just tried it, but i am not impressed.  Somebody tried very 
hard to make the resulting /dev look like devfs instead of following 
devices.txt... Especially unconditionally using tmpfs for /dev is a
bad idea if the user wants/needs to use ACLs.
So i'll continue to work from your sources.

Oh, i realized that. But my point is: shouldn't they be based on the 
CLASS of the device rather than the name? After all the names are 
changeable, but the class is not...
I checked the hotplug-devel archives and saw that somebody has already
posted a patch doing that. So i guess the question boils down to:
Will you accept it or not?

Would you care to explain how to do it?
