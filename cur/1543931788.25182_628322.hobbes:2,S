Then perhaps it is. Perhaps it's a race condition in my userspace
where something NetworkManager related is trying to up the interface,
I don't know. More below.
Regardless, I'm going to have to put off doing more debugging until
tomorrow. I've rebooted back into 2.6.23.0 as wireshark doesn't show
any packets using 2.6.24-rc3 (the version I've been testing), reported
elsewhere, and that's preventing me from doing actual work with my
system, as I'm in the middle of trying to enhance a network server for
a client.
Note, the wireshark issue is very much not a bcm43xx/b43 issue; I'm
not trying to lay that at your feet.

I don't have the patch applied, so that's at least part of the
misunderstanding here. All I have is my sequence of "load b43, ssb,
nothing happens, unload them, load rfkill, rfkill-input, ssb, b43 and
something happens." I could very well be wrong. But I'm at the limit
of what I care to know about the b43 driver, and this is where I'm
asking for your help.
Hopefully tomorrow, I'll be able to build current tip and try this all
again, and I'll also try to do it with NetworkManager killed in the
background in case it was trying to bring the interfaces up behind my
back.

Thanks for treating me like an adult.
