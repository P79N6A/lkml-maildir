Think about it - you seem to be suggesting that adding more and more swap will
free up more and more physical RAM to be used as cache, but that it not really
true, because once you've freed up all of the physical RAM, there is no more
to free up.
That it not to say that there is no point in having more swap than physical
RAM at all, rather that once all non-filesystem-backed pages apart from cache
have been pushed out to swap, (and note that executables can and will be pushed
out to swap independently of swap space anyway), all that additional swap
space will allow is to run more processes, or move cache out to swap, which
admittedly could give a performance benefit in some instances, but in most
cases I think it would be minimal.
