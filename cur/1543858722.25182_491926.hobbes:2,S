Actually, if you want it to be perfectly clear to people who don't keep 
x86 spec sheets in the bathroom for spare time study, a redundant config 
option for NX would be required. Then the logic would be:
    PAE = MEM>4G || NX
as far as the actual build was concerned. Or you could reject NX in 
config unless PAE was selected.
I don't think you will avoid confusion when you have two unrelated 
reasons for enabling the same feature.
