because if you need that much stack space then you shouldnt care about
kmalloc() overhead anymore.

kmalloc()+kfree() is not thousands. At least on SMP it has a nice frontend
cache and batch allocator component, which makes it much cheaper.
32 bytes you can allocate on the stack no problem. If you need to allocat
and *fill* 2K then kmalloc() overhead will not matter to you.

we will not add significant overhead to *every part* of the kernel just to
keep a ridiculously large stack around for those few drivers who should
use kmalloc() to begin with. And believe me, some people will then want to
do recursion on the stack and would complain even about a 1MB stack. There
is a limit to draw, and on Linux it's 'no bigger than a few hundred bytes,
allocate dynamically otherwise'.
