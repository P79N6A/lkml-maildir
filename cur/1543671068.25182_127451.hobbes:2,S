Hello,

Woah, exactly the same I have, doing the same operation :-)
I have to add that this is happening with a kernel where DMA is
activated by default on IDE disk, so there should be no need to
do that (I didn't try without DMA activated by default).

Don't know, but got SiS too (Mobo is ASUS P4S8X).
