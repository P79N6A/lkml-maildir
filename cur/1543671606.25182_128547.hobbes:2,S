Well, if you're arch doesn't support any struct device * but those
embedded in struct pci_dev or NULL you don't need to do much
but sticking a to_pci_dev() ontop of each function.
Btw, did you read my posting from Friday on this issue?  The subjects is
'[HEADS UP] planned change to <asm-generic/dma-mapping.h> will cause
+arch breakage'
