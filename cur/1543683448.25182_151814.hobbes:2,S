they do collide only on the patch level - both change the same code.  
Otherwise, most of Con's tunings/changes are still valid with my patches
applied - and i'd more than encourage Con's work to continue! Watching the
tuning work i got the impression that the problem areas are suffering from
a lack of infrastructure, not from a lack of tuning. So i introduced 3 new
items: accurate statistics, on-runqueue boosting and timeslice
granularity. The fact that these items improved certain characteristics
(and fixed a couple of corner cases like test-starve.c) prove that it's a
step in the right direction. It's definitely not the final step.
