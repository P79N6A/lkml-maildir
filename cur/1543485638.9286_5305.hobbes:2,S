You mean that everything is fine in 2.1.107? If so could you send me the
TCP diffs included in patch-2.1.108?

                   ^ this is the bit I am talking about
porcupine doesn't put a 0 in such place but it would put the timestamp
3027206 instead. This looks the natural way to handle timestamps but after
my yesterday very (and only) short read of the RFC it seems not strictly
requested so I can't tell you that Linux is buggy putting _always_ a 0 in
the tsecr of every syn-ack.

This is something of crazy and should be a bug in porcupine or in the
middle man.

Don't know. Trusting the SOCK_PACKET code looks like it's a sender bug to
me.
>Anyone see exactly this problem on a _non_ isdn connection?
Really yesterday I tried an ls in /pub/security and it was very slow (as
_everything_ else from here) but worked after a while. 
Would it be possible that porky (or some other men in the middle) when
receive the syn-ack it just does (jiffies - tsecr) and use the computed
value to set a bogus RTO and/or to do some other mess? I don't think it's
the case but to give a try I changed the 2.2.2-pre2 linux TCP stack to do
exactly what porcupine does (reverse engeneered from the tcpdump, I don't
have the time to see which OS is running porcupine) in the synack
timestamp case.
You may want to give a try to this my patch and see if the bad behavior
will go away.
