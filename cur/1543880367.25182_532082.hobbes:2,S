Uh, yes, didn't think of that. I'd even say that's the majority of
devices allocated in a driver.

I was relying on the object being zeroed after allocation (and the
caller of kobject_initialize already setting ->owner), but passing an
owner via the initializing routine sounds saner. Thanks for looking at
that.

Hm, this means we always have an owner (until we explicitely call
kobject_{init,register}_owner(kobj, NULL)) - which may be unneeded in
some cases. But better to err on the safe side, I suppose.
