Hi,

Yes, the cat output was from 2.4.16.  Kernels before -rc1 can remount
this root partition without errors.

Ok, I'll try that tomorrow.
(In Japan, it's midnight.  I want to go to sleep now.)
> Also were there any reiserfs specific error messages prior to the oops?
There was no error message from reiserfs.
Thank you.
