Extrapolating out from Steve's last comment yesterday/day before,
this final blk_run_queues removal here should be replaced with:
+	if (flags & PBDF_WAIT)
+		blk_run_address_space(target->pbr_mapping);
and we XFS guys need to huddle some more and figure out whether the
magic number used earlier there (32) and the request starvation it
was preventing, is still an issue on 2.6.  
cheers.
