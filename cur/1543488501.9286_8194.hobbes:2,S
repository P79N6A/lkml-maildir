Still I think this brain-damage has already been implemented somewhere...
maybe even at the brain-damage center at redmond ;)
... and it definitely was implemented for 32-bit memory addressing on 16-bit cpus ;)
Even another question: What are the current memory limits for x86 Linux (2.2.x) ? 
(ram, swap, address space?)
... pointers to information about the kazillion resource limits and
extending/circumventing/wotever them would be appreciated too ;)
