Thank you.
In particular the bug is triggered by the patch named:
        "writeback: introduce writeback_control.more_io to indicate more io"
That patch means to speed up writeback, but unfortunately its
aggressiveness has disclosed bugs in reiserfs, jfs and now ext2.
Linus, given the number of bugs it triggered, I'd recommend revert
this patch(git commit 2e6883bdf49abd0e7f0d9b6297fc3be7ebb2250b). Let's
push it back to -mm tree for more testings?
