You forgot shared memory via mm/shmem.c and ipc/shm.c.
Another possibility is to test whether the driver provides a nopage
function, as i/o areas are usually mapped with io_remap_page_range. The
only exception I found are drivers under drivers/sgi/char, which use some
really dirty tricks in their nopage function.
