distcc is pretty good too. I have a minimal kernel build done in 19 
seconds, a fuller build (1.5MB bzImage that boots on all my testboxes) 
done in 45 seconds, using gcc 4.0.2.
with the default settings, distcc wasnt saturating my boxes, the key was 
to start distccd with a longer queue size (/etc/sysconfig/distccd):
 OPTIONS="--nice 5 --jobs 128"
and to get the DISTCC_HOSTS tuning right:
 export DISTCC_HOSTS='j/16 n/120 v/40 s/13 e2/7'
in fact my distcc builds are almost as fast as a fully cached ccache 
build coming straight out of RAM ...
