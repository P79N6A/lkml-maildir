        I received the following in my system logs recently:
---
Nov 27 22:56:20 king kernel: KERNEL: assertion (!sk->sk_forward_alloc) failed at net/core/stream.c (279)
Nov 27 22:56:20 king kernel: KERNEL: assertion (!sk->sk_forward_alloc) failed at net/ipv4/af_inet.c (151)
        All I could find related to this was some potential bugs
mentioned in 2.6.9 and in particular with relation to TSO.
However, I'm running a vanilla 2.6.13.4 at the moment.  But, I do
have an e1000 and checking ethtool does show TSO on.
        Anyway, ignore if this is unimportant.  The machine is
still up and running, so it doesn't appear to be fatal.  Let me
know if you need my .config or output from dmesg or whatever.  I
guess I'll upgrade to 2.6.14.? or wait for 2.6.15.[12] just to be
safe!
