What I mean is that I've seen profiles of the worst (from Andi) showing up to 5%
cpu time on some workloads! That's a heck of a lot slower than when it's
latched.

Looks well worth it

Thanks!

I would not put this in an unlikely because on the machines where
pmtmr_need_workaround is true this will always be true.
