Yes and no; the benefit of HT depends on the application in question. 
I've seen everything from a 5% LOSS in performance to a 30% INCREASE in 
performance, for intensive floating-point code. This is with programs 
parallelized with OpenMP and Intel's C and Fortran compilers. I'm still 
analyzing the exact nature of the benefits, but they *do* exist.
While I much prefer multiple physical CPUs to "virtual" CPUs, HT *does* 
provide performance improvements for certain applications. To call HT a 
"big lie" is both provacative and inaccurate.
