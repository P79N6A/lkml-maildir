Hello,
is there a simple way in either 2.4 or 2.6 to get a lot more than 32 groups per
uid?
Imagine a situation with lots of groups (lets assume 5000-10000). It is obvious
that in such a large environment users are commonly members of more than 32
groups.
How can I solve that?
I'd say it should even be possible to be member of all available groups (in
other words completely drop this limit).
Regards,
Stephan
