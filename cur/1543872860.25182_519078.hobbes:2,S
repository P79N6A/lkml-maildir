Well, it is the simplest possible example. The last 3 fields will be 0,
which is a valid configuration.

I hope it works for you.

Yeah, they need to be a bit more configurable than they currently are.
And I think it makes sense to pass them from the board setup code, since
this is where things depending on board-specific details (signal quality
issues, pullup resistor values, etc.) are supposed to go.
