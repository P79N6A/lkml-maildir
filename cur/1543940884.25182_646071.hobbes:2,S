Worse, the GRU takes its TLB faults from within an interrupt so we
use follow_page to prevent going to sleep.  That said, I think we
could probably use follow_page() with FOLL_GET set to accomplish the
requirements of mmu_notifier invalidate_range call.  Doesn't look too
promising for hugetlb pages.
Thanks,
