well - a WARN_ON() can be /anything/. It is the same as BUG_ON(), but it 
doesnt crash the box immediately and on purpose. In that sense all 
existing BUG_ON()s should be converted to WARN_ON()s or to panic()s 
(whichever fits best for that particular BUG_ON()).
[ or all WARN_ON()s should be converted to BUG_ON()s and the behavior of
  BUG_ON() should be changed to /not/ crash the system on purpose - and
  for those cases where we really do not want to continue, panic()
  should be used. That way the user can set panic policy himself. ]
i can whip up a patch for any of these conversions, but i dont think we 
need this flux right now.
