Yes, I was referring to the feature itself.
I don't know much about dmcrypt, but in the (similar) case of
loop-encrypt, the initrd program could simply call losetup (or mount
-oloop), which would prompt the user for the key and pass it to the
kernel using the LOOP_SET_STATUS64 ioctl. After the mount, you can
pivot_root to your encrypted fs and get rid of the initrd.
I'm sure you can do something similar for dmcrypt.
