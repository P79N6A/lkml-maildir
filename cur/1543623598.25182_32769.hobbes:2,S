seriously, ide has always been a joke for anyone serious in storage capacity
or robustness. so what.
if you were serious in using ide drives you would have been using external
patches for quite a while anyway. nothings changed.
Well, nothing, except that now, that there will be a much higher percentage
of users that relies on external patches for ide to be useful
or work at all
time for someone actually has a clue on how modern ide drives works to have
a say for a change...?
