You can do that if you do not care about extended features, just use
/dev/input/mice and all should be fine (well, for tapping to work you will
have to pass psmouse.proto as in-kernel synaptics->PS/2 protocol emulation
does not process taps).

That is correct. You should use one input section for devices speaking
PS/2 protocol and other input sections for devices using other protocols.

Well, that is not a surprise as /dev/input/mice is a synonim for /dev/psaux
in 2.6. If you have your XFree reading from both devices you will get
duplicate events no matter what hardware it is (USB, PS/2, Synaptics).
Now, default XFree86 Synaptics setup has "auto-dev" protocol and "/dev/psaux"
device, but with "auto-dev" protocol the driver actually scans
/dev/input/eventX devices for Synaptics and /dev/psaux is only used as a
fall-back so the same setup works in 2.4.

Try psmouse.proto=bare or psmouse.proto=imps

That means that your hardware does not have the problem I described in my
other mail.
