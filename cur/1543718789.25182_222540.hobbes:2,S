Why do you think that there is a typo?  Did you check the USB
printer specification?
LP_PERRORP == 0 means Error.
LP_PSELECD == 0 means Not Selected (or means User disabled the printer).
LP_POUTPA  == 1 means Paper Empty.
See, LP_POUTPA has different error polarity than the other bits.
I don't see a problem.  Are you experiencing some problem with
a USB printer?
