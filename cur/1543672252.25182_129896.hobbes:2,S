Hi all, Alan,
I've been trying to make my 640 MB ATAPI MO drive work with the
ide-floppy driver. I've patched ide-probe.c and ide-floppy.c for
assigning the MO drive (type ide_optical) to the floppy driver
(patch against 2.4-bkcvs below).
On bootup, the drive now gets reported as:
hde: FUJITSU MCC3064AP, ATAPI OPTICAL drive
hde: attached ide-floppy driver.
hde: No disk in drive
hde: 520192kB, 508/64/32 CHS, 2000 kBps, 512 sector size, 3600 rpm
These values would be correct for a 512 MB MO disk in the drive. So far,
so good.
Upon inserting a 640 MB disk and running 'fdisk -l /dev/hde' I get:
hde: 620704kB, 310352 blocks, 2048 sector size
hde: warning: non 512 bytes block size not fully supported
hde: 618496kB, 151/64/32 CHS, 2000 kBps, 2048 sector size, 3600 rpm
hde: The disk reports a capacity of 635600896 bytes, but the drive only handles 633339904
 hde: unknown partition table
The size and geometry stuff reported first looks good (310352 blocks is 
also reported when using ide-scsi/sd for the drive). The second line
with slightly different size looks wrong, though.
That "non 512 bytes block size" stuff doesn't look encouraging. On
trying 'mount -t ext2 -o ro /dev/hde /mnt/mo', I get:
hde: warning: non 512 bytes block size not fully supported
hde: The disk reports a capacity of 635600896 bytes, but the drive only handles 633339904
 hde: unknown partition table
hde: unsupported r/w request size
end_request: I/O error, dev 21:00 (hde), sector 2
EXT2-fs: unable to read superblock
hde: warning: non 512 bytes block size not fully supported
hde: The disk reports a capacity of 635600896 bytes, but the drive only handles 633339904
 hde: unknown partition table
The disk is formatted as a whole (no partition table) and works just fine
when using ide-scsi.
I cannot test with an MO disk with 512 byte sectors since I don't own 
any.
Are there any plans to support drives with blocksizes != 512 bytes? What 
changes would be needed to make it work? Or do I simply have to live with 
ide-scsi (still broken on 2.5, I assume...)?
Finally, the patch I used:
