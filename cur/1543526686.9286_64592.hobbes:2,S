Can you reproduce module problems with my imb fix applyed? My module fix
is just included in 2.3.47pre6 and this is the 2.2.x version:
	
ftp://ftp
.*.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/andrea/patches/v2.2/2.2.14/alpha-imb-2.gz
While my fix is certainly necessary to get the self modifying code
(modules) correct, I am not 100% yet sure it fixes all the modules
troubles for everybody out there. If my patch doesn't help please send me
detailed bugreports.
Thanks.
Andrea
