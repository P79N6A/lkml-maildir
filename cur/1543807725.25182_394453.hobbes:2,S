EAs would be fine - and they dont have to be propagated down into the 
hierarchy. There's no reason to propagate them if the lack of EA means 
'inherit from parent'. Btw., not all filesystems need an extra block 
seek - e.g. ext3 embedds them nicely into the raw inode.

sure.

It's so much cleaner and more flexible. I bet it's even a noticeable 
speedup for users of the current cpuset-based approach: the cpuset 
method forces _all_ 'large' objects to be allocated in a spread-out 
form. While with the EA method you can pinpoint those few files (or 
directories) that include the data that needs the spreading out. E.g.  
/tmp would default to 'local' (unless the app creates a big /tmp file, 
for which it should set the spread-out attribute).
another thing: on NUMA, are the pagecache portions of readonly files 
(such as /usr binaries, etc.) duplicated across nodes in current 
kernels, or is it still random which node gets it? This too could be an 
EA caching attribute: whether to create per-node caches for file 
content.
This kind of stuff is precisely what EAs were invented for.
