Subject: [PATCH] document sysfs rom file interface

idr gently pointed out today that not only is the sysfs rom file 
interface somewhat unintuitive (despite my efforts and initial 
implementation), but it's also undocumented!  This patch to 
Documentation/filesystems/sysfs-pci.txt corrects the latter problem; the 
former is a userland ABI now though, so we're stuck with it for awhile 
at least.

 Accessing legacy resources through sysfs

 Supporting PCI access on new platforms

 In order to support PCI resource mapping as described above, Linux platform
 code must define HAVE_PCI_MMAP and provide a pci_mmap_page_range function.
