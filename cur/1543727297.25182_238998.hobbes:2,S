That was one example. I'm guessing that one might want to
test for other policy groupings, like these:
SCHED_RR | SCHED_ISO
SCHED_BATCH | SCHED_NORMAL
SCHED_SPORADIC | SCHED_NORMAL
SCHED_EDF | SCHED_FIFO
If that's certainly not going to be useful, even in the future,
then of course there's no reason to allocate the values as bits.
In any case, it's a user ABI issue, and I'd like to see what
the allocations are going to be. Perhaps I should send in a
patch that just allocates a few of these...?
