Kurt,
That's right. If read() returns zero... it means the stream is over.
So, finally, both select() and read() behave correctly. I have a lot to
learn... as you see.
Thank you VERY much!

                  ^^^^^^^^ NO!
returning 0 is completely different from "error". It is the standard
"end of file" indication.
You should also note that errno is not modified in that case.
