I remain unclear what's expected to happen when there IS no such
architcture-defined clock ... but where the system itself still
has one, e.g. a board may access one through I2C or SPI once IRQs
are working normally.
You'll recall that I had pointed out that the drivers/rtc framework
provides CONFIG_RTC_HCTOSYS, which already unifies quite a lot of
the "persistent" clocks in the way you described above, but without
that nasty requirement of working without IRQs enabled.

... and timekeeping_init() is called before I2C or SPI could be used,
since IRQs aren't enabled yet and accessing those busses can't be
done in general without IRQs enabled.

Again: sys_device resume() is called with IRQs disabled, which
prevents access to many systems' persistent clocks.  In fact,
after posting this example patch
  http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=115600629813751&w=2
I never heard anything more from you on this issue.  Given this
particular patch (in $SUBJECT) should I assume you're going to
just ignore the issues whereby RTCs ("persistent clocks") can't
always meet the no-IRQs-needed assumptions being made here?  Or
address isssues like using pointer-to-function instead of using
linker tricks?

Those class suspend/resume hooks are now merged to kernel.org, by
the way, so that example patch is now pretty much deployable.
