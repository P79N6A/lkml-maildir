Hmm, I could instead have one file per loaded LSM, which could
obviate the need for the stacker/unload file, but that would make
it more work for a user to find the ordering of the LSMs.  I wonder
how much that would matter.
I'll implement your other changes, and consider switching to a
stackerfs (versus changing the content presentation under sysfs).
thanks,
