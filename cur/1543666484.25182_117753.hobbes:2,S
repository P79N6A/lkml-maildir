Well don't do that then ;-)
 # Common NUMA Features
config NUMA
        bool "Numa Memory Allocation Support"
        depends on (HIGHMEM64G && (X86_NUMAQ || (X86_SUMMIT && ACPI && !ACPI_HT_
ONLY)))
I guess SMP should be added to the dependencies, but the whole things 
getting a little twisted. Let me try and sort it out properly this afternoon.
