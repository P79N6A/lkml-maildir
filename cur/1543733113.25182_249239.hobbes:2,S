The "d" stands for directory not dentry :-)

I don't think so, since this notify will only happen if the process has
registered for the notification and there is no way to register unless the
file is a directory ...

I had intended to extend dnotify to do file notifies, but I think the
real killer is needing the keep the file open that you want to be
notified about when you want to be notified about lots of files ...
I think that is what inotify was trying to fix (but I haven't had a chance
to look at it recently).  It reminds me of omirr that we had many years
ago - I wonder what happened to it?
