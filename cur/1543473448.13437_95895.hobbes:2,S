I guess you need a program like ezppp or an equivalent
(see www.linuxapps.com to find it) for easy setup of
your dialout connection.

A few more suggestions:
- teach yourself a bit of nettiquette (don't SHOUT)
- use an appropriate list or newsgroup for posting,
  the linux-kernel list is for highly technical discussions
  about the core of the Linux OS. You probably want a group
  like comp.os.linux.setup or the linux-newbie list...
