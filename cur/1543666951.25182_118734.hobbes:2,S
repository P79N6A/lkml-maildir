You are correct and here's a little program to show the problem
and demonstrate when it gets corrected.
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <signal.h>
#include <time.h>
#define BUF_LEN 0x10000
unsigned long amount = 0L;
void timer(int unused) {
    fprintf(stdout, "Kilobytes / sec = %lu\n", amount >> 10);
    fflush(stdout);
    amount = 0L;
    alarm(1);
}
main() {
    int fd, len;
    char *buf;
    if((fd = open("/dev/null", O_RDWR)) < 0)
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    if((buf = malloc(BUF_LEN)) == NULL)
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    (void)signal(SIGALRM, timer);
    alarm(1);
    while((len = write(fd, buf, BUF_LEN)) > 0)
        amount += (unsigned long) len;
    free(buf);
    return 0;
}
On my SMP system, using kernel version 2.4.20, I get:
Kilobytes / sec = 3987136
Kilobytes / sec = 4101760
Kilobytes / sec = 1984
Kilobytes / sec = 4138304
Kilobytes / sec = 33664
Kilobytes / sec = 4189888
Kilobytes / sec = 432
Kilobytes / sec = 4122880
There is an awful big variation and I'm the only one on
this system!! If I disconnect the network line so I
truly get the entire attention of both CPUs, I get:
Kilobytes / sec = 3717402
Kilobytes / sec = 320250
Kilobytes / sec = 239501
Kilobytes / sec = 1893527
Kilobytes / sec = 23
Kilobytes / sec = 6783920
Kilobytes / sec = 1296789
Kilobytes / sec = 5109001
How, what the :F: makes the thing stumble down to 23 kilobytes
per second?a `taint right.
Cheers,

Why is the government concerned about the lunatic fringe? Think about it.
