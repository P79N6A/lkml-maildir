Actually we should be able to address this pretty simply by disallowing
exports of symbols which are in the __init section.  There's no sense in
exporting something which ain't there.
IOW, any reference from __ksymtab, __ksymtab_gpl or __ksymtab_gpl_future
into __init or __initdata should be a hard error.
It'd be lovely to do that at compile-time, but I cannot think of a way.
Sam, does that sound reasonable&&feasible?
