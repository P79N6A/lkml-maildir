Ext2 does not do journaling. Ext3 does.

Then if this filesystem is specifically targeted ONLY on embedded
then that's reason for keeping it out-of-tree.

But if a filesystem COULD be made to work for MORE users - why not?
I'm sure that more than a few might use it in some form if such a limit
is removed - why lock us into a corner that when we do get around
to fixing it we need a new on-disk format and then we might have a new
filesystem, squashfs2 or whatever.

I think that's because people see a potential in it that has a flaw
that should be taken care of so that MORE people can use it, and
not ONLY "embedded people with 8 or 32 MB".
Seriously, noone's flaming here - I think what people want is
for a limit to be removed, and that is not in my eyes a bad thing.
