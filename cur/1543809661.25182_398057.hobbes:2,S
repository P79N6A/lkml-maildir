correct.

little/big endian shouldnt be a problem i think, as this is a 
nonpersistent object. (futexes do not survive reboot)
The 32-bit-on-64-bit support code was indeed interesting, but it's also 
pretty straightforward. See kernel/futex_compat.c where the 64-bit 
kernel walks a 32-bit userspace. The method i took was to have _two_ 
lists:
        struct robust_list_head __user *robust_list;
#ifdef CONFIG_COMPAT
        struct compat_robust_list_head __user *compat_robust_list;
#endif
and at do_exit() time we process _both_ lists, first the 64-bit one, 
then the 32-bit one. This handles execution environments that have both 
32-bit and 64-bit state - they could crash in e.g. 32-bit mode holding 
robust futexes, while holding 64-bit robust futexes too. This method 
correctly handles e.g. x86 binaries on x86_64 [i checked that], and 
native binaries too.

in this particular case i dont think it could be described in a more 
generic way. I'm not against your idea per se - but someone would have 
to code it up ;) Nor do i think that in this particular case we'd need 
more flexibility than the patch offers: only a minimal amount of things 
are 'hardcoded' in the robust-list approach, and even those are either 
known futex properties, or are 'obvious' approaches like the fact that 
it's represented as a linked list. (which is what glibc uses anyway) But 
e.g. we dont force the single linked list: userspace can use a 
double-linked list too - the kernel will simply walk the single-linked 
component of that list in a forwards way.

i think my patch is a good example of how to do it with our existing 
tools: i separated the list walking into a separate function 
(exit_robust_list() and compat_exit_robust_list()), which purely handles 
the data structure details.
In theory you are right, these two functions do essentially the same 
thing, and we could have automatically 'converted' 
compat_exit_robust_list() from the native exit_robust_list() function - 
but in practice it was a pretty straightforward process anyway for these 
~50-line functions. I think it would need a more complex example than 
this to justify some sort of new language.
