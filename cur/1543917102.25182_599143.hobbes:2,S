There is a way to do this without code duplication, but it is creating a 
non-inline function which calls the inline and calling the non-inline from 
userspace. It's done for a variety of other functions.
There is a tradeoff of speed vs code duplication - and if this function is not 
supposed to change and to need to be kept in sync, it could be copied. I 
conceptually hate this solution, but it can make some sense.
