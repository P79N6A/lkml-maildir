debian does not have a "perl-based startup system" (or if it does,
you have to go override the default and install something other than
sysvinit).
debian uses standard sysvinit. Miquel van Smoorenburg (the author of
sysvinit) is a debian developer, and has been for many years.
BTW, redhat uses a NON-standard sysv style init. i don't like it, but
it's not that hard to get used to. it's certainly better than bsd's
monolithic /etc/rc or slackware's /etc/rc abomination.
