So they describe the restrictions of the method instead of the method 
itself.  You apparently think that's significant; I don't see where it makes 
a difference.  In fact, I *expect* them to do so:  they don't want to annoy 
any vendors by specifying method, so they take the safe way out and use a 
description that avoids any mention of the method but describe restrictions 
that are compatible with the most common method (other than #define).  
Welcome to the world of vendor standards.
