No problem, also a `make -j80` would show the same ;).

If you go in swap I trust. The point is that -j make no limit in the
number of gcc child launched at once. This mean that you may easily go out
of memory, and when you start swapping and shrinking memory you are going
to be very single threaded even if the application runs mostly
userspace code...
Try with a more moderate load `make -j20' for example. Compare it with a
plain make and you'll see ;). There's to say that `make -j20' should be
faster also on UP compared with a plain `make', because you will take the
CPU always busy even when you wait for I/O completation (so good thing! ;).
>Please advise how that compares with your sample?
Run `make -j20' on a SMP machine with pre-2.2.8-4 UP kernel. Then run the
same on the same SMP machine but this time with pre-2.2.8-4 SMP kernel.
Comapre the times (really I never tried on the same machine... so it's
interesting ;).
if you want you can also do a third try with my new patch with my
improved VM buffers and scheduler (I am very courious ;):
