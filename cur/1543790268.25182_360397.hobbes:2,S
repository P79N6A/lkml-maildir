2.6.14-rc5-np1 includes Hugh's pagefault scalability work and my
lockless pagecache and RCU radix tree work (which is getting stable).
Also, some straight-line performance increases for mm/ which are
worth about 5% kernel residency on kbuild on UP, and about 7.5% on
SMP on a P4 Xeon.
And some various small improvements to corner cases in the radix tree
code.
Performance testing and results would be interesting, on big machines
or small.
