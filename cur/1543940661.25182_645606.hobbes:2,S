OK, thanks. I just wanted to be sure I didn't miss some other reason.

Err, I was double wrong. It _is_ trivial to set ->exe_file before exec_mmap(),
	flush_old_exec:
+ 		get_file(bprm->file);
+ 		set_mm_exe_file(bprm->mm, bprm->file);
		retval = exec_mmap(bprm->mm);
		if (retval)
			goto mmap_failed;
		bprm->mm = NULL;		/* We're using it now */
If exec_mmap() fails, the caller (do_execve) has to mmput(bprm->mm)
anyway, and this imply set_mm_exe_file(NULL). This way set_mm_exe_file()
doesn't need any locking.
Not that this is relly important, but still.
However. I didn't notice this patch plays with #ifdef CONFIG_PROC_FS.
Without CONFIG_PROC_FS we seem to leak bprm->file, I'd suggest to move
get_file(bprm->file) into set_mm_exe_file().

Thanks for your answers ;)
