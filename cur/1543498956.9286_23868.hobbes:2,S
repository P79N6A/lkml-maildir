Ok. During the last days I tested all single shift _hashfn's from (>>2)
to (>>13) and according to these tests the winner is (>>6):
#define _hashfn(dev,block) \
 (((unsigned)((HASHDEV(dev)+block)+(block>>6))) & bh_hash_mask)

Of course, e.g. 'dd' and 'e2fsck' can grow the buffer cache to use
almost all of the available memory, but these are quite boring tests.
dd is happy with almost any _hashfn.
One of my current benchmarks is 'du > /dev/null' in a large directory
tree so that it still fits into the memory:
  du $BENCHDIR; sync; time du $BENCHDIR > /dev/null
This way mostly the raw buffer cache performance is tested (with a
cachesize of >60% of the entire RAM). According to this benchmark a
mean bucketsize (MB) of 8 is about as fast as a MB of 1. A MB of 16 is
much slower (about 6%). Since the benchmark uses > 60% of the entire
RAM I think even the biggest buffer cache should be happy with MB=4 and
a MB of 2 should be plenty.
