They (ide interrupts) are indeed EDGE-triggered on my box. I have not enabled
the HPT366 (ATA66) controller on this board, so I can not tell if that
controller is EDGE-triggered as well.

There's sound... The msnd.c (Turtle Beach MultiSound) driver (and its
derivatives, like msnd_pinnacle) uses disable_irq.  Running esd (esound
daemon), sound can easily generate > 1000 interrupts/second, since esd uses
small dma transfers. This can be seen quite clearly from /proc/interrupts on my
soundserver:
           CPU0       
  0:  276867328          XT-PIC  timer
  1:          2          XT-PIC  keyboard
  2:          0          XT-PIC  cascade

NMI:          0
OK, this is an ageing P166, and it uses a different driver, etc. I have not
found any problems with hanging sound drivers in Google query for 'linux msnd
bp6' or 'linux multisound bp6'. Of course, this is no conclusive evidence, far
from it... It could be that people using those cards are not the ones who tend
to go for the (somewhat tricky) BP6 board...
