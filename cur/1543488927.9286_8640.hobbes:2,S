Hello!
Due to the fact that it hasn't been done yet, I'm going to attempt to port
linux to the older mca based rs6000 machines, specifically the 7011-250
with a 601 PPC chip (because that's what I'll have and it's not the POWER
chip). Anyone that has knowledge of the internals of the machine,
documentation, or driver source code, please get in touch with me.
