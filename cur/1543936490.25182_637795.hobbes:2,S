OK, at the risk of looking like a fool:
Yes, it does treat this as only one device per box as that's the way
the things are made.
The hardware will stop you from running two commands in parallel - the
device will be flagged as busy and so you won't be able to get it do
anything sensible. I have now added in some additional checks so that
a user cannot start another command before the old one finishes - but
I still don't see what the problem is with freeing the memory.
The variable is a local, and an automatic, not a global or a static,
so I don't see how kfree() could be releasing somebody else's lump of
memory anyway. Or have I missed something obvious?
