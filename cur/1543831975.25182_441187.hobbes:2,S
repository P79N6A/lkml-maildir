Here is the answer (by Dave Hansen, 2004):
__pa() is simply supposed to be the addr-PAGE_OFFSET calculation.
virt_to_phys() will be guaranteed to take care of any layout changes if
kernel addresses ever fail to be mapped flat, and 1:1 with the physical
address layout.
So, let's say that someone is working on ... say ... memory hotplug.
They will be modifying the virt_to_phys() function to make up for any
weird mappings that are going on.  But, they'll leave __{v,p}a alone,
because those are used for stuff that occurs very early, even at compile
time.
More virt_to_phys() and less __pa() will save me lots of auditing later
on :)  If you're not in early boot, or really know what you're doing,
use virt_to_phys() and cousins.
Plus, it's more type safe.
