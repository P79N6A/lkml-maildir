Can you run kgdb on it to figure out what is going on?

Run kgdb and see what is going on in the fault handler.
There are some variables in /proc/vmstat that may help:
spurious_page_faults 0
cmpxchg_fail_flag_update 0
cmpxchg_fail_flag_reuse 0
cmpxchg_fail_anon_read 0
cmpxchg_fail_anon_write 0
etc.
