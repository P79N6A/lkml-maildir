Of course it's true. The implimentation detail of trimming the
start or finish of a copy procedure trims the ends. That's,
in fact, why it is impossible, yes, __impossible__ for the byte-sequence
0xABC to have both 0xA and 0xC copied without the 0xB being copied also.
There are no combinations of byte/word/long writes that will allow
this to happen.
It doesn't make any difference about the endian either as I
have previously shown.
Whether or not there's an interrupt between each byte means nothing
also. In the byte copy described, an interruopt at any time will
simply leave:
XXX
XXC
XBC
ABC
Clearly, if both A and C were copied, B was copied also.
You can screw around with endian and use words and longwords
as well. It just isn't possible for, in any 3-byte sequence
for the middle byte to be missing.
If 0x0A, 0x,0B, 0x0c, exist in memory as a word (longword),
with Intel, the lowest byte is in the lowest memory location.
Therefore, we have a word of 0xXCBA or 0xCBAX, depending upon
whether the high nibble or the low nibble becomes part of the
short. Notice that the 'B' is always between 'A' and 'C'?
Therefore if A and C got copied, B must have also been copied.
