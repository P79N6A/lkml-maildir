You just want GFP_ATOMIC, not the OR of both.
I do not see where the lock is in the call path, though.  The
lock_kernel() is not counted.
I also wonder why the __might_sleep was just triggered but the
schedule() check was?  Are you sure this is the culprit?  By the looks
of it, I would think it is somewhere north of __might_sleep in the stack
trace.
