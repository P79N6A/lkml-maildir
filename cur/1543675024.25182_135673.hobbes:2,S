Marcelo,
[Noting that there is no changelog pertaining to PCMCIA in rc4] PCMCIA is still not usable for me with stock 2.4.21-rc4 kernel.
I can reproduce a complete hang (no response whatsoever) with rc3 everytime I boot with the PCMCIA service enabled.
I am patching it with latest ACPI patch from Sourceforge, but turning ACPI off doesn't make a difference.
Of course I can try vendor kernels or -ac, but is PCMCIA something with a priority low enough for such a major bug to be ignored?
(See my earlier post [2.4.21-rc3 PCMCIA serial_cs.c Reproducible Hang] - for complete details)
If anyone is interested I am ready to provide all details and experiment further.
Parag
