Guys, could we please bring this back to a useful discussion.  None of
you have commented on whether the rlimits for priority are useful.  As I
said before, I've no real problem with the module as it stands since it's
tiny, quite contained, and does something people need.  But I agree it'd
be better to find something that's workable as long term solution.
thanks,
