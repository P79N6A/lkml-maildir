Subject: [2.6.7.11, BUG] spin_lock_irqsave() unsafe for use with FIQ and no spin_lock_localsave() exists

like the subject says.
i utilised spin_lock_irqsave() with a FIQ handler, expecting to be able
to do this:
	spin_lock_irqsave(...)
	local_fiq_disable()
	spin_lock_restoreflags(...)
aaaannnd it caused some weirdo behaviour - not surprisingly because
spin_lock_irqsave() calls local_irq_save() which ONLY saves the
interrupt handler flags - NOT the FIQ handler flags.
a spin_lock_saveflags() which does exactly what spin_lock_irqsave() does
except it calls local_irq_save would be _greatly_ appreciated.
in linux/spinlock.h.
because i'm having to #define one anyway.
tia.
