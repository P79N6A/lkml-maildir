Failed to apply git-kgdb
Conflicts with the arm, ia64, mips, sh and driver trees (at least).  I
fixed most of them but gave up on sh, where there has been major code
motion.

Please do - just email out the patches with carefully-chosen cc's.  It's
not a hugely productive time of year and responses may be spotty and slow
but you should just persist - send them every couple of weeks and let's
drive this nail home.
