Hi. I just did some video encoding on my desktop and I was noticing
(for the first time in a while) that running apps had to hit swap quite
a lot when I switched to them (the encoding was going at full blast for
most of the day, and most of the time other running apps were
idle). Now, a good half of my RAM appeared to be free during all this,
so I was thinking at the time that it would be nice if swap prefetch
could be tunably more aggressive. I guess it would be ideal in this
case if it could kick in during tunably low disk-IO periods, even if
the CPU is rather busy. I'm sure you've considered this, so I only butt
in here to cast a vote for it. :)
Of course, I could be completely wrong about the possibility.. and I
seem to remember that the disk cache can take up about half the ram by
default without this showing up in 'gnome-system-monitor'... which I
guess might happen during heavy encoding.. but even if it did, I could
have set the limit lower, and would then have still appreciated
prefetching.
