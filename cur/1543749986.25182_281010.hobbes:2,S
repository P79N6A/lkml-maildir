I'm running it in a loop for a day and no oom yet. This is all as well
applied to the current suse kernel and it's behaving very well so far
(well except the oom killer with oracle that in order to fix it badness
must be rewritten with a completely different algorithm). Let's limit
the workload to normal desktops for now so we don't have to change
everything at once.
Patches applied are Andrew's ignore-swap-token, Andrew's write
throttling total_scanned, Con's disable-swap-token, my oom
killer fixes (but that should not influence the write throttling), my
lowmem-reserve (that can definitely influence it on big boxes and it's a
must have for any computer with more than 1G), and a few more certainly
unrelated bits.
So I recommend you to try again with at least "Andrew's
ignore-swap-token, Andrew's total_scanned, Con's disable-swap-token and
my lowmem_reserve". Effectively disable-swap-token obsoletes
ignore-swap-token, but both makes sense together since just in case
somebody enables the feature, ignore-swap-token will give it a chance
not to generate a suprious oom kills.
