It certainly is easy to find an exact border.  You have three types of
servers.  Open relays, blocked/untestable servers and compliant servers.  It
takes more work to dig up the net blocks than it does to automatically
tally.
Being that all the servers I touch fit 100% into the compliant group as is
reported by ORBS itself with a couple of clicks, I'd say it's pretty darn
easy to tally it correctly.

Go to the verify page and type in the IP, it'll come back in a moment with
an 'OK' status.
The IP fits into an above.net netblock which is in their hallofshame.html
page.

Look at 
http://www.orbs.org/hallofshame.html,
 1/2 down the page.  Netblock
216.200/16 neatly surrounds mail.linux.com.

When your school becomes blocked, you goto your friends, when your friends
become blocked, you go where?  How many times are you going to pack up and
move your email before enough is enough?

Yes, -your- fone line.  Not your neighbors or anyone else you call.  Only
-your- fone line.

Yes it is.  Look at the above URL.  Also look at
http://www.orbs.org/bugtraq.html
 and 
http://www.orbs.org/above.net.txt.

Now look at mail.linux.com:
-- cut --
# host 210.201.200.216.relays.orbs.org.
210.201.200.216.relays.orbs.org has address 127.0.0.4
# host -t TXT 210.201.200.216.relays.orbs.org.
210.201.200.216.relays.orbs.org descriptive text "above.net has multiple
open relays and has blocked the ORBS tester."

Yes, there certainly is.  Think about it.  How do you test the entire
internet address space for open relays?  Do you start by blacklisting the
entire thing because "there is no way to tell" which ones are good and bad?
No.  You list the servers that return 400/500 responses to relay injection,
you list servers that are unknown status (blocked) and you list servers that
grant 200 responses.

# host -t TXT 210.201.200.216.ok.orbs.org.
210.201.200.216.ok.orbs.org is a nickname for 2.0.127.127.ok.orbs.org
2.0.127.127.ok.orbs.org descriptive text "This server has been tested by
ORBS and appears to be secure against relaying"
Funny how it's a compliant server by ORBS but ORBS feels it's fine and dandy
to levy the blacklist, eh?

You have three types: Compliant, Unknown, and Non-compliant.  Systems that
fit in Unknown could be broken, down, bad routing, and they could be
firewalling ORBS.
It doesn't matter.  Compliant servers should NOT be blocked.
This entire discussion about blocking is not relevant to the rest of the
address space served by above.net, above.net is blocking a segment, we exist
in a different segment.
