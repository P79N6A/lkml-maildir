OK. Could you then deliberately change the following in ide/main.c
+	/* Most controllers cannot do transfers across 64kB boundaries.
+	   trm290 can do transfers within a 4GB boundary, so it changes
+	   this mask accordingly. */
+	ch->seg_boundary_mask = 0xffff;
+
+	/* Some chipsets (cs5530, any others?) think a 64kB transfer
+	   is 0 byte transfer, so set the limit one sector smaller.
+	   In the future, we may default to 64kB transfers and let
+	   invidual chipsets with this problem change ch->max_segment_size. */
+	ch->max_segment_size = (1<<16) - 512;
I would in esp. like to see the result of setting  ch->max_segment_size 
= (1 << 15).
