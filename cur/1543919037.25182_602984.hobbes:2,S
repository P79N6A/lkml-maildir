In AppArmor, we plan to 'containerize' (not sure what to call it) policy
so that you can have an AppArmor policy per container. This is not
currently the case, it is just the direction we want to go. We think it
would be very useful for virtual hosts to be able to have their own
AppArmor policy, independent of what other hosts are doing.
The major step towards this goal so far is that AppArmor rules are now
canonicalized to the name space.
However, I have never considered the idea of separate LSM modules per
container. The idea doesn't really make sense to me. It is kind of like
asking for private device drivers, or even a private kernel, per name
space. If that's what you want, use virtualization like KVM, Xen, or VMware.
