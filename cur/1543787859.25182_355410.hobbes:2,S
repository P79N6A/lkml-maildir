the advantage of actually having a null transport driver rather then 
bypassing the transport layer completely is that you avoid having to make 
the SCSI core know about details of the interface to the chips, and 
especially about any bugs that crop up and have to be worked around for 
different chips.
or worse yet, as the spec of the interface to the hardware changes over 
time the SCSI core would have to know about all the different variations 
and how to deal with them.
it's much cleaner to evict all that knowledge out of the SCSI core and let 
a very lightweight transport driver deal with that instead.
the drawback is that you may end up copying a little bit of data one time 
more then you absolutly have to, but that's probably a very small cost for 
the flexibility.
think of this as a problem similar to the network card interface, vendors 
want to implement TOE while the kernel folks are willing to do TSO, but 
not TOE (see the letters being exchange on lwn.net in the letters to the 
editor section the last few weeks for a good discussion on those issues)
