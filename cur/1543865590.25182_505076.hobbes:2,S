i have released the v2.6.20-rt1 kernel, which can be downloaded from the 
usual place:
  
http://redhat.com/~mingo/realtime-preempt/
more info about the -rt patchset can be found in the RT wiki:
  
http://rt.wiki.kernel.org
This is a fixes-only release. Since the -rt tree has been closely 
tracking Linus' upstream kernel since -rc1, no new issues are expected - 
please re-report if anything is still unfixed.
There are lots of changes relative to 2.6.19-rt6 (the last stable 
release), but these are mostly fixes and other gradual improvements. KVM
is now enabled in the yum kernel on both i686 and x86_64 (and has been
enabled since around -rc1-rt1), the -rt tree tracks kvm-trunk (which is
a bit fresher than upstream KVM) and has a few additional paravirt
speedups implemented and enabled.
to build a 2.6.20-rt1 tree, the following patches should be applied:
  
http://kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/linux-2.6.20.tar.bz2
  
http://redhat.com/~mingo/realtime-preempt/patch-2.6.20-rt1
the -rt YUM repository for Fedora Core 6 and 5, for architectures i686 
and x86_64 can be activated via:
   cd /etc/yum.repos.d
   wget 
http://people.redhat.com/~mingo/realtime-preempt/rt.repo
   yum install kernel-rt.x86_64   # on x86_64
   yum install kernel-rt          # on i686
   yum update kernel-rt           # refresh - or enable yum-updatesd
as usual, bugreports, fixes and suggestions are welcome,
	Ingo
