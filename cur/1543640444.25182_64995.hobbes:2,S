The 8/17 run of the nightly bk testing I'm doing turned up a lot of page
allocation failures in the dmesg and eventually an oops in swap.c:85
(uncaptured, will try to reproduce on current).  Unfortunatly this meant
the test did not run after that.  This morning I rebooted the machine
and ran it against the current bk tree and with a single test was able
to produce a LOT of these messages:
page allocation failure. order:0, mode:0x50
The test was: 'mtest01 -p80 -w' which will essentially allocate up to
80% of the memory and write to it.  I'll keep pounding on it with LTP to
see if I can reproduce the swap.c:80 oops.
Thanks,
