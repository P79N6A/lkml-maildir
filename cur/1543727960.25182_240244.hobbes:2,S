Hi all, I've been trying to track weird behavior I'm experiencing when
trying to use 2.6.x for "pro audio" applications and I think I have
something to report (and some questions). 
First, the environment. I'm running the Jack low latency server on top
of two different software installs on the same hardware, one is FC1 +
2.4.26 + low latency and preemption patches, the other is FC2 + 2.6.7
rc2-mm2 + voluntary preemption O3. They are different hard disks swapped
into the same P4 laptop. Both are running the same source code versions
of all the audio programs that I use to test (but _not_ the same
binaries, each one is built in the environment it runs on). 
One example app that illustrates the problem well is Freqtweak, a
frequency domain sound processing application that includes controlled
feedback of the frequency domain bins. If I connect a source to it and
feed samples and then disconnect it (ie: feed silence), and let the
processed samples inside Freqtweak slowly decay to zero, at some point
the processing load of the app goes up _drastically_. It eventually
gobbles up all the cpu if left alone. If I feed samples to it again, the
load immediately goes back to normal. This only happens on the 2.6.x
based environment. It does not happen on the 2.4.x case. 
My guess is that the processing of denormals is different in my two
environments, in the 2.4.x case they are converted to zeros, in the
2.6.x case they stay as denormals. To check the load denormals create
Steve Harris wrote a small app and tested on several processors:

I added these two cases this morning:

So, is there a way to do this?  (toggle denormals-are-zero)
Is this setting indeed different on 2.4 and 2.6? (denormals-are-zero).
If the default setting is the same on both 2.4 and 2.6, where would this
be changed if the kernel is not responsible for the change in behavior
I observe?
