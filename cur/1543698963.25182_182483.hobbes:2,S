I started work on this about 2 weeks ago and have not yet tried the 
"Halt Disconnect patch and Stop Grand Disconnect bit or 2" patch. 
My lockups ceased with just the apic time delay. I agree the delay is wasteful
but the code branches into other servicing routines which I did not want to try to
rearrange as yet. Given the infrequent nature of the lockup in CPU cycles maybe we can get
smarter and read the timer register and see if enough time has expired to safely ack it. Is
the Apic read cycle fast like cache ram (assume as fast as bus cycles?) or slow like 8259?
Doing something like,
=
= loop:	Read Apic timer count
=	if count is xx cycles since rollover then 
=		Ack apic
=	else
=		loop
=
After all it counts bus cycles doesn't it.  Alternately perhaps there is a status bit in the apic 
somewhere to check against after we ack to ensure that it did its job although we would
not want to hammer the apic with writes it cannot accept?
Or maybe it is not too bad for now, I note that there is an existing fixed 400ns delay in the
IDE command routines ide-iops.c ide_execute_command() which we currently tolerate.

I have not tested the nmi against the b) io-apic mods. We may have a vector clash?
Perhaps the new apic mpparse.c patch lets the existing check_timer() routines work properly?
I have not yet tried it.
