Hello,
I'm running a 2.2.10ac5-nonSMP kernel on a x86 box.
On /dev/hdd, there is a sixspeed CD-ROM. Now
/proc/ide/ide1/hdd/driver says correctly:
  ide-cdrom version 4.53
but /proc/partitions lists the (empty) CDROM drive
as:
major minor  #blocks  name
[...]
   22    64 1073741823 hdd
Shouldn't that rather be "0" blocks? Or: shouldn't
the entry for "hdd" disappear in /proc/partitions
when no medium is currently inserted?
ciao,
johnny
