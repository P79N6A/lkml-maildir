Subject: [RFC] Script for doing unattended kernel benchmarks using contest
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Hi all,
this is the first release of autocontest.pl
Use it at your own risk, I just can say that "It works for me(tm)"
What's that?
A simple (and ugly) PERL script for automated kernel benchmarks, it was 
written for contest <
http://contest.kolivas.net/>,
 it simply generates a 
custom (dummy) runlevel and boot every kernel image found in 
/etc/lilo.conf in this runlevel, perform contest, reboot the next image, 
perform contest, etc.
Err OK, what do I need to run it?
PERL 5 will do, hopefully.
LILO, with it's config file in /etc/lilo.conf otherwise edit the script 8)
Bash, along with cp, cat, rm, and find
A directory /usr/src/linux-2.4.19 with the 2.4.19 kernel sources in (this 
is for contest)
How do I run it?
perl autoncontest.pl and then cross your fingers 8)
Will it screw my initscripts?
I don't know
Why your english is so crappy?
I'm Chilean, I speak Spanish 8)
How it works?
Read the source, Luke.
It was tested on RedHat 7.3 and (null), and debian 2.2, if it runs in 
another version/distro, please let me know
Questions/Comments/Patches/Rewrites/Rants/Flames are welcome.
Best regards.

#
# The script takes care of boot each kernel image and run
# contest a couple of times with each one.
#
# Following assumptions are made:
# 
# - You're using LILO, GRUB version will follow if this one probes useful
# - Your system is compatible with redhat or debian (It was tested on those)
# With "compatible" I mean:
# It has /etc/inittab, /etc/rc*.d, and a SysV way of "init"
# - You have PERL installed, if not, it won't run, believe me 8)
# - You have a directory /usr/src/linux-2.4.19 for make the compiles
# - Options used to boot are vga=normal and apm=off
# 
# I can't say it will work on your system, "It works for me(tm)"
# Feedback is of course welcome, rants about PERL Monkey Style goes to /dev/null
#
# Changelog:
#
# v0.04a - User definable variables
# v0.03b - Some code commenting
# v0.02  - uid(0) check, autoselection of runlevel number
# v0.01  - insane first version
#
# Customize at your taste, defaults should be ok
# nload = how many times noload will run
# pload = the same for process load
# mload = memory load
# ioload = io load
