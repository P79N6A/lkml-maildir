Matthew Wilcox and I have previously volunteered to get MSI working
on parisc arch. parisc, like systems with Local SAPIC, only
operates on transaction based interrupts at the CPU level.
We need an arch hook to set the target address of the CPU
instead of looking at ID/EID bits but haven't proposed
anything concrete yet. My understanding is SGI needs the
same thing for Altix/SN2 platforms.
thanks,
