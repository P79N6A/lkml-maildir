This is true for very small buffered writes, which is the case for
desktop usage, but for more server oriented usage if the write isn't so
small, and you flush the writeback cache to disk very slowly, eventually
it will become a _sync_ write. So I agree that as long as the write
doesn't become synchronous "as" provides better behaviour.
One hidden side effect of "as" is that by writing so slowly (and
64KiB/sec really is slow), it increases the time it will take for a
dirty page to be flushed to disk (with tons of ram and lot of continous
readers I wouldn't be surprised if it could take hours for the data to
hit disk in an artificial testcase, you can do the math and find how
long it would take to the last page in the list to hit disk at
64KiB/sec).

sure.

It's already the best for desktop usage (even the 64KiB/sec is the best
on desktop), but as you said above it uses significantly different
concepts and that makes it by definition not general purpose (and
definitely a no-way for database, while cfq isn't a no-way on the
desktop).
