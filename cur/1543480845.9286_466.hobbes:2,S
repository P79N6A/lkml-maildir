G'day all,
I would just like to add to this, I have been running netscape on 2.1.1*
and have had this problem. I have a modem dial up, so I don't think it has
much to do with wether you have cable modem, or slower. I too like to
browse with >15 windows open. But recently it seems to crash with less
windows open.
I tried to go to anyother browser because it had annoyed me so much, but
too my suprise there wasn't much out there that got close (correct me if
I'm wrong) to netscape. 
The versions of Netscape which showed this problem seemed to be 4.0? -
4.5. ie every version I have tried. I haven't tried 3.0?, which I may try
tonight.
I never reported it to the Linux kernel list because it didn't seem to be
kernel related. But since some one else posted I may as well put my 2 bobs
worth in.
