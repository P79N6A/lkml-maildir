   Alpha definitely needs mb(), ld_l/st_c doesn't imply any memory
   barrier (yes, alpha is very aggressive in SMP 8).
I wonder if it then makes sense to just provide a set of bitops
interfaces then which enforces the barrier.  Or perhaps the other way
around, make what we have now enforce the barriers and have
__clear_bit et al. not do the memory barrier part.
Later,
