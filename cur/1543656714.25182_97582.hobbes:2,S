	As I don't have this hardware, I fully depend on people trying
the code to know if it works or not. This driver has been for 6 months
in kernel 2.5.X and on my web page (and advertised on the IrDA mailing
list), and it's only today that I get the first negative bug report.
	I really wonder what I do wrong. Maybe I should throw untested
code straight in 2.4.X, like other people do, that may bring the bug
report faster.
	From my casual look at the driver code, it looks like the
hardware self test is failing. There is a way to disable this self
test via module parameter "do_probe". Maybe you want to check that.
	Also, would you mind sending this bug report to all three
maintainers of the driver ? Also : would you mind sending the log
output of the old toshoboe driver (assuming it works - does it ?).
	Have fun...
	Jean
