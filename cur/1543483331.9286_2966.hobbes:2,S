Hi,
This problem appeared in 2.1.x; it disappared briefly somewhere between
2.1.132 and 2.2.0-final, but is now back in 2.2.1.  My NFS client machine is
a 2.2.1-based Alpha, the server is a 2.0.35 machine running nfs-server
2.2beta37.
To put it simply, the following sequence causes mail loss in every client
I've tried:
 * Mail is in my mailbox
 * I delete it
 * New mail arrives
 * Mailbox is synced to disk (client unaware of new mail), new mail
   is deleted with no warning.
Now, here's what's interesting.  I can do a ls -l of the mailbox, and it
will show up with a certain size on the server.  On the client, it will show
up with a certain *SMALLER* size!  (This would be the period of time between
when the new mail arrives and the client is aware of it).
Now.  How come non-Linux OSs have no trouble in this situation?  How come
2.0.x works?  How come 2.2.x does not?  How can it be fixed?
