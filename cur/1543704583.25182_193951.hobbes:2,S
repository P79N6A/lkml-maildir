Thats what i was assuming. Shaping alone is insufficient as well.

So why cant you attach a ingress qdisc on eth1-2 and use policing to
mark excess traffic (not drop)? On eth0 all you do is based on the mark
you stash them on a different class i.e move the stuff you have on
IMQ0 to eth0.
Example on ingress:
meter1=" police index 1 rate $CIR1"
meter1a=" police index 2 rate $PIR1"
index 2 is shared by all flows for default.
index 1 (and others) is guaranteeing rate (20Kbps) for each of the flows
etc.
Look for example at examples/Edge32-ca-u32
The most important thing to know is that policers can be shared across 
devices, flows etc using the "index" operator.
I just noticed you are copying linux-kernel. Please take it off the list
in your response, this is a netdev issue. This should warn anyone
interested in the thread to join netdev.
cheers,
