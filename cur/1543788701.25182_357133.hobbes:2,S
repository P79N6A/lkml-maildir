The term "vanilla" is short for "plain vanilla", which means lacking in 
adornments or extra features.  It is derived from the use of vanilla as 
a basic flavor in deserts to which other optional flavors may be added. 
  For the kernel, vanilla simply refers to Linus' kernel with no extra 
patches applied to it.
Example:
   2.6.13 is a vanilla kernel
   2.6.13-rt3 is not (it's vanilla 2.6.13 + rt patches)
