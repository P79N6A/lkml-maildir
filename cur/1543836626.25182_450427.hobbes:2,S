Just from review...
If new zone , which was empty at boot, are added into the system.
build_all_zonelists() has to be called. (see online_pages() in memory_hotplug.c)
it looks x86_64's __add_pages() doesn't calles it.
Precisely, look online_pages() (CCONFIG_MEMORY_HOTPLUG_SPARSE) 
==
       setup_per_zone_pages_min();
        if (need_zonelists_rebuild)
                build_all_zonelists();
        vm_total_pages = nr_free_pagecache_pages();
==
These 3 calls are necessary, I think.
