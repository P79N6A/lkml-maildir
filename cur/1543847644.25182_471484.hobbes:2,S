It's assuming that unmap_hugepage_range() is always freeing these pages. 
If the page is shared by another mapping, bad things will happen: the
threads fight over page->lru.
Doing
+	if (page_count(page) == 1)
		list_add(&page->lru, &page_list);
might help.  But then we miss the tlb flush in rare racy conditions.
