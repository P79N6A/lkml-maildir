Hi,
I am one of the person reporting success with some BIOS version over 
another. I have been experimenting some more and found the following:
Sytem:
Board: MSI K7T Turbo (MS-6330)
CPU: Athlon 1.2 GHz
Video: NVidia GF2
Kernel: 2.4.6ac5 with the patch Kurt Garloff posted here some while ago 
(can't find the right reference)
Ranking from very unstable to stable:
Very unstable: 2.4.6 plain, Award V2.7 Bios (i.e. without the 
Southbridge bug solved the official VIA way)
Unstable: 2.4.6ac5 with or without Kurt's patch, Award V2.7 Bios
Stable (up to now): 2.4.6ac5 with Kurt's patch and Award V2.8 Bios.
The key factor seemed to be the BIOS. The MSI website says that the 
following things changed between release 2.7 and 2.8:
- Fix STR Fail on MS-6330Lite.
- Fix 3Dmark 2001 sometimes halt
- Fix K7T Turbo Limited cannot adjust vcore
Only the second fix seems applicable to my mobo, but the description 
does not give a clue.
I hope that someone can distill something useful out of this. I am of 
course willing to try some other combination of parameters if this would 
help finding the source of the problem.
Cheers,
Gerbrand van der Zouw
