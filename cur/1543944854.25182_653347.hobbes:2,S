Hi everybody,
I'm developing a driver to support a new protocol on the kernel 2.6.x,
a real time communication protocol used in robotic fields. Skipping
the intro: I need to know if there is any function in the kernel to
get the process sleeping, as down_interruptible(...), but with
timeouts, I mean, I want the process to wake up if no signal is
detected in a while...
Thanks anyway,
