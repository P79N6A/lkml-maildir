The reason why recursive read side locking works in the patches I posted, is 
the fact that the _locking_is_unfair_. Which means even when a writer is 
waiting, if there are readers in the system,a new reader will go ahead.
I can try incorporating this unfair model to Ingo's  suggestion 
as follows:
- A writer on arrival sets the global flag to writer_waiting.
- A reader on cpuX checks if global flag = writer_waiting. If yes,
and percpu(refcount) == 0, the reader blocks. if percpu(refcount)!=0,
the reader increments it and goes ahead,because there are readers 
in the system.
This should work, if not for task migration. It may so happen that
a task has already taken a read lock on cpuX, gets migrated to cpuY
where percpu(refcount) = 0. Now a writer arrives, sets the global flag.
The reader tries taking a recursive read lock gets blocked since
percpu(refcount) on cpuY is 0. 
Ingo, I am wondering if lockdep would be of some help here.
Since lockdep already checks for recursive reads, can I use it in
the above case and allow the new reader only if it is recursive?
I don't like the idea of explicitly checking for recursiveness
in the locking schema. Just that I can't think of a better way now.
Thanks and Regards
