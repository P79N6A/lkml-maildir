Check on freshmeat (freshmeat.net) and do a "find" search for
debuggers.  You'll probably find it.  If not, then I'm sure
someone else will point you in the right direction.

Hmm.  You need the full "Oops" report to determine that.  Also,
make sure that your System.map file is the one that was generated
when you compiled your kernel, and that it is in /boot, or one of
the other places that syslog looks for it.
Good luck!
