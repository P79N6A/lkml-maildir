This sounds fantastic!  I'd always hoped that my document would be a
starting point for something more substantial, yet it never happened
8(
One word of warning: beware tying it too closely to shifting
architecture.  In particular, the original HOWTO was aimed at pointing
experienced programmers in the right direction, not reading the code
to them.
Perhaps consider adding:
	Kernel Style
		Don't do it in the kernel
		Don't sprinkle ifdefs
		User interfaces: read/write better than ioctls
		Architecture specific code & portability
		GNU extensions
	Kernel Politics:
		Licencing
		How to get a patch in
		Who owns what code?
Hope that helps,
Rusty.
