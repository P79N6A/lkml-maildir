Hmmm, wouldn't it be nice to make this all configurable? Like; have
some list of PIDs that can be killed?
I would hate it the daemon that checks my UPS would get killed...
(that deamon brings the machine down safely when the UPS'
batteries get emptied).
Would be something like:
int *dont_kill_pid, ndont_kill_pid;
// initialize with at least pid '1' and n=1
         for_each_task(p) {
		int loop;
		for(loop=ndont_kill_pid-1; loop>=0; loop--)
		{
			if (dont_kill_pid[loop] == p->pid) break;
		}
              if (p->pid && !(loop>=0)) {
                         int points = badness(p);
                         if (points > maxpoints) {
                                 chosen = p;
(untested (not even compiled or anything) code)
