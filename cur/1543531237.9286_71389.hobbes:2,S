The user quotas on my system do the same.

No, yours will fail because it is out of memory too.

That's a quota. I'm talking about overcommit, not the quota settings.

It is, and has been for a long time, AFAICS. It just hasn't been
written yet, because there isn't enough demand.

It is. However, there is nothing to discuss - I KNOW we need user
quotas. Continuing explaining WHY we need them achieves nothing.
Either write the code yourself, pay someone else to do so, or wait for
someone else to do so of their own accord. Don't continue justifying
the need for them - we've already accepted that.
