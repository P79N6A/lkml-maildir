It can matter. Evicting a page that is infrequently referenced by many
processes increases the chance that all runnable processes block waiting
for that same page later. The likelihood of that happening grows under
memory pressure, when "infrequently" may actually be "quite often" and
when disk I/O is congested (resulting in higher disk access times).
You won't have the same effect when evicting a page that is referenced
by one process only, no matter how frequently.
Having all processes blocked is indeed one problem of 2.6 under memory
pressure. I don't know what the cause is, though.
