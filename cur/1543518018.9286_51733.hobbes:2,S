NT is a stinker. There is no question about that, except in the MS marketing
dept. It does get a worse press than it deserves, though. I would guess that
something like 90% of all BSOD and registry scrambling incidents are due to
iffy third party drivers. The S3 ViRGE NT driver is a true stinker, that
causes endless trouble with scrambled machines, and that was the market leader
in its hay day. Binary only drivers a PITA with all OSes, open source or
otherwise.
For balance, MS joins in the fun. Their IDE driver bombs the OS on a range of
disk faults, so one dead drive, or a dead element in a software RAID set,
results in a BSOD.
