Why do you think it would kill the FUSE process? And why do you think 
killing _any_ process would make the system come back to life? After all, 
memory wasn't filled by process usage, it was filled by dirty FS pages.
I really do believe that user-space filesystems have problems. There's a 
reason we tend to do them in kernel space. 
But limiting the outstanding writes some way may at least hide the thing.
