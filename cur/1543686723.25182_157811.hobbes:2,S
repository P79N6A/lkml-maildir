Will do. I like to also handle Video mode change. Even userland will like 
to know when a mode change happened. For userland a signal can be sent. 
This would be useful for someone in X that runs fbset in a Xterm. This 
hoses the X server. It would be nice if the X server would see the signal 
change and adapt to it. Fbset could in theory be used again to change a VC 
size. Yuck!!!! But it is what people want.
