On an (otherwise clean, and cleanly unmounted) ext3 partition, I got
some ext2fs errors like the following:
Inode 295208, i_blocks is 112, should be 8.  Fix<y>?
Inode 295342, i_blocks is 8, should be 0.  Fix<y>?
Inode 295343, i_blocks is 8, should be 0.  Fix<y>?
Inode 295344, i_blocks is 8, should be 0.  Fix<y>?
[...]
I looked up the inodes with debug2fs and noticed that all of them belong
to files which probably had failed write attemps because the fs was
full.
This happened with 2.4.18-rc2-ac1, neither the latest one nor a
'release' version, but I don't remember reading about such a problem on
linux-kernel.
