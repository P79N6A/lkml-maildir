Sure. I mentioned it in the changelog. I, however, am not sure If I
agree it should be enclosed
in ifdefs. Me and Jeremy discussed it a while ago, and we seem to
agree that for those functions
that are exclusive of one architecture, there were no need for ifdefs.
Any usage by the other arch
is a bug.
But I admit that I'm not particularly biased here, and I can change
it, if there's agreement that
an ifdef here is the way to go.

Which also means it does not affect the binary in anyway. No bigger
code, no nothing.
My current approach is to save the ifdefs for pieces that in fact can
save us some resources
in the final image. But again... I can change it.
