You are not by chance using athcool or something to enable disconnect?

Well, I also think it is quite stupid to only apply the fix if
disconnect is enabled at boot time and don't apply it if it is not. The
kernel dev responsible for it is rather pedantic: Fix only when needed,
ie don't apply anything in a foreseeing way (prevent what could break),
if change something in userspace, do it correctly. (not exact words of
course, but the conclusion of it.) Ie if you enable disconnect outside
of bios and kernel, you should also set the fix by hand...
Easy workaround: Enable disconnect in bios, if possible, then the kernel
will fix it for you...
I admit there is logic behind the dev's point of view, nevertheless it
is not a very near-to-life-and-make-it-simpler-for-the-user logic. There
is often a difference in point of view of kernel dev and average user...
