fcomp_scan() being dumb.  I have to alter it.  Also a little bit in fcomp_push()
(I thought realloc(0, n) would be like malloc(n)).
BruteForce() needs to be altered a bit because of a compiler bug:
for (j = 0; blah blah; j++){ }
must become
for (j = 0; blah blah; ) { j++; }
For some odd reason.  Debugging, it seems to infinitely loop here and
leave j as 0.
You know it would help if someone would grab GDB, grab the source,
and debug it!  My head is starting to hurt....
Any takers?
