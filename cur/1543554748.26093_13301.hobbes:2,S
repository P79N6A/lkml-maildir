Exactly. And I'll change page_launder() to:
1. write dirty swap cache pages to disk
2. do some IO clustering (maybe) or rely on luck ;)

If the usage count of the swap entry is 1 (all users of the
page have swapped it in and the swap cache is the only user),
then we can free the page from swap and the swap cache.
