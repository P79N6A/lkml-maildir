page->private is also available for internal use. The objection here
was about not using the standardized list macros. I'm not convinced
about the fat since the keyspace is tightly bounded and the back
pointers are in struct page regardless. (And we also just happen to
know page->lru is also available though I'd not suggest using it.)

Hmm, I can understand caution wrt. touching core. I suspect vma->close()
should do hugetlb_key_release() instead of sys_free_hugepages()?
