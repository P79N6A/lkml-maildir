Subject: Spying on the state of network interfaces from a kernel module - how?

     Hello.
 I would like to know is there's an elegant solution to the following
problem:
 I need to track the state of network interfaces (going up/down,
addition of the new interfaces, IP change (i.e. ifconfig) from
a kernel module.
 I  imagine that I can poll for changes (I know how to walk
the device list) but this is not "nice" and will leave time intervals
when my module is not aware of the changes in network devices (which
is a bad thing).
 If there's any way to set up a callback (or insert my function into a call
chain?)
on the event of changes in network devices, it would help me a lot.
 The other problem is that I want to be able to load my module on average
preconfigured linux system without re-compiling the kernel.
---------------------------------------------
  Also, if anyone knows how to control IP forwarding (on/off) from the
kernel module
please let me know. I can see the code that's responsible for
/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
but the functions are not exported to /proc/ksyms.
  Any help is welcome, please
 e-mail me directly at roman@checkpoint.com
 Thanks in advance
