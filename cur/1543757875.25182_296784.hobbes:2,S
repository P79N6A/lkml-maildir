I posted a similar thing, but the problem is not that you get the 
message. It means your hardware generated an unexpected interrupt. The 
kernel is reporting that fact as it should.
The problem I had (not resolved) is that after the message
   DISABLING IRQ NN
I continued to get interrupts! So the logic to disable the IRQ is not 
working correctly.
as you note, because the hardware is generating the condition, no one 
seems to care, even though there clearly is a problem in the disable 
logic. I found a way to fix my hardware thanks to some pointers I got, 
so I'm running, but I haven't heard that the base problem is fixed.
