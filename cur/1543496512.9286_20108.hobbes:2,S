The problem as I see it is that syslogd's timestamps MUST sometimes
imply races that aren't there, simply because it will timestamp an
entire batch of messages with near enough the same time when they were
actually spread out by several seconds, or even minutes on occasions.
Take the messsages generated during booting: If your point is correct,
then all messages generated prior to syslogd/klogd starting up are
marked with effectively the same timestamp (namely the moment when
syslogd reads them), no matter how long apart they really were, and as
a result, any races that would've shown up with the true timestamps
are of necessity hidden and can only be guessed at...
Best wishes from Riley.
