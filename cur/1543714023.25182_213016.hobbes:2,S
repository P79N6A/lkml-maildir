In general - do not use the kernel headers from userland.
Most of the problems described here is due to wrong usage
of kernel header files.
If you need to use the kernel header files for normal day-to-day
work you have a misconfigured system.
And DO NOT put kernel src in /usr/src/linux - this is only asking 
for trouble.
Put it in /usr/src/linux-2.6.5 for example - with no symlinks to
/usr/src/linux
Some individual comments follows:

make *config shall do minimal work, and is only supposed to create
.config. No side-effects such as crating a symlink.

Point taken here. New cleaning style is:
clean: Leave enough to build external modules
mrproper: delete all generated files, including .config
distclean: Delete editor and patch backup files
If one needs to do the old trick:
save .config
make mrproper
restore .config
Then something is broken and needs fixing.
