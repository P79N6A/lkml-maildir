actually, i think it should possibly be a netdevice.  eventually
i will consider this path.

netdevice has this which is why i would probably use that.  i would
also get kobject support for free there (or so i imagine)

no.  a later patch will get rid of those though.  next in the queue 
will be to make atm itself modular and make vcc's do reference counting
(via their struct sock parent).  i could fix the MOD_ nonsense next if
its really bothering you.
