Does this mean that 6.01 will NOT work either? What drivers will be
affected? We've already made the move to remove LVM from the mix, but
your comments above give me some doubt as to how definite it is, that

In-house? Just curious. What can "I" do to know if our configuration
won't get broken, just by removing LVM? TIA.
