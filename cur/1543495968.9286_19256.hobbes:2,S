I am sorry for the false alarm.  I still believe there are some time-out
issues in the kernel (SCSI subsystem), but they have now fallen back
into non critical.  My problem seems to be that for some reason (yet
unknown) my computer LOVES to generate lots of heat.  It seems this was
affecting the drive as now that I am burning CD's with the cover off I
was able to erase the CDRW I had 'ruined' and burned two copies of what
I was trying to do the other day to CDRW and now nearly done with a CDR
(past the magic 421 and 454 meg marks where it had always failed).  I
really think this will be a success.  This is the most successes I have
had in a row under linux.
To the person (who obviously is working on the SCSI code) who sent me an
email, I have all but the errors from cdrecord (and I can tell you what
the text messages said more or less) in log files.  I will send those to
you shortly and let you figure out if there is indeed a  problem in the
driver/scsi layer that needs to be addressed.
Again, sorry for the false alarm.
Trever
P.S. Are Cyrix MII-300, Permedia 2, and Diamond Fireport Dual 40 known
to be major heat sources?  Or do I just have a power supply or something
that generates HEAT?
