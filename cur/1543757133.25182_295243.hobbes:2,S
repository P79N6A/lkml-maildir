Doh! My bad, I changed the attribute for the return value to get it on
par with the dma-mapping.h file, which as it turned out, was changed
by myself some time ago.
An aonther issue, what I'd like to see, is sort of a "don't care"
attribute which could be used to mark some of the library functions,
e.g. memset and family. AFAICS, many of them shouldn't need to care what
address space they're handling, and at the same time we could get rid of
a lot of the __force casts. Please correct me if this sounds completely
wrong or otherwise insane.
Any other comments welcome.
