Candidates in pre10-jam2 could be:
11-irqbalance-B1.bz2
12-smptimers-A0.bz2
13-irqrate-A1.bz2
excluding anything that has nothing to do with pipes or latency.
Could you try latest -rc1-aa2 ? It includes also irqbalance, so it could be
on varable less in the equation.
I dropped smptimers and irqrate because they did not mix very well  with
bproc and O1 scheduler, but I can try to add them again.
I have a rc1-jam2 ready, but the only important change wrt SMP could be the
mem-barrier specific implementation for P3/P4, and your box is an AMD.
