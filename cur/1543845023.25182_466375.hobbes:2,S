This patch has some problems.  (Apologies for being so slow to look at
them!)
We're reporting svc_max_payload(rqstp) as the server's maximum
read/write block size:

But svc_max_payload() usually returns sv_bufsz in the TCP case:

That's the *total* size of the buffer for holding requests and replies.
If a client actually tries to send a write of that size, the entire
request will of course exceed sv_bufsz, so we'll drop it.  (We've seen
this happen with the Solaris v4 client.)

Is the rounding up *always* going to increase the size?  And if not,
then why doesn't accuracy matter?

I think this results in 80 less bytes less than before, I think.
No doubt we have lots of wiggle room here, but I'd rather we didn't
decrease that size without seeing a careful analysis.
