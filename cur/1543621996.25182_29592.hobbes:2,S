I agree that in most case (drivers) it is the right thing.
But for kernel/, arch/ there are no simple way to tell:
"this makefile rule belong to this configuration".
In such cases we should not split makefiles and configurations
in an artificial way.
We should not generalize and split configuration and makefile
just because in most case it is the right thing.
[ Some Makefile define at the beginning some flags that
   should be used for all driver in such subdir.
   These info should be in a 'main' .conf (main = where normal
   user would check, without grep to all .conf)
