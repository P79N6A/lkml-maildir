This definitely fixes that error path: I just get one, clean error
now, and no corruption of the file that was masquerading as the
journal.  It doesn't properly release the journal inode, though, so we
oops on a later ext2 mount as we think we already have the (ext3)
inode in cache.  Fix to follow.
Ben, thanks for this --- this level of corrupt journal is something
that hasn't been tested in this way before.
