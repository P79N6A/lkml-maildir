I've already made noise about separate modular framework patches, so
recast whatever confusion seems apparent to you in those terms.

Compiling such things out is interesting at best, as they typically
require significant code restructuring. You can make the indirect calls
conditional by calling some particular driver directly inside wrapper
macros for the indirect calls via case analysis on ->policy, I suppose.
There are issues with using cfs' notion of a modular framework to
verify performance non-regression, in particular the fact it's
incapable of representing mainline. There is also the problem of doing
very little in the way of hiding data, so that in the event of using it
to compare different implementations of the same policy, e.g. competing
SCHED_OTHER implementations, each is stuck maintaining the others'
state variables, save for the case where one or both happens to have
all its state variable updates fit entirely inside the driver operations,
in which case they still take the hit for bloating the task_struct, and
worse yet, some asymmetry in terms of which is exempt from maintaining
the others' state variables occurs which furthermore penalizes the
competitor maintaining the least state or doing the least state updates.
Such a state of affairs must not be allowed to stand.

It certainly cuts down on the eye bleed but I suppose that takes a
back seat to performance considerations.
