Maybe a more positive approach would be to say, hey, I got this program
from the XFS guys that tests for DMA problems on power failure, maybe
all the Linux filesystem developers should give it a try?
Shall we try that style of interaction?
Ted, if this corruption hits an ext3 directory structure, and that
corrupted directory structure commits, what happens?  With ReiserFS
(Chris please comment here) it would have to corrupt the directory in
the journal, return successful IO, then after that point not corrupt the
commit block and have enough power to write the commit block.  How is
that different for XFS or ext3?
