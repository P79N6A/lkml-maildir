It does do something. By providing this function, we over-ride the
default flow of execution.
If we did not provide this function, the flow would be the following:
iput_final -> generic_drop_inode -> generic_delete_inode (or
generic_forget_inode).
However, since we do not care about the i_nlink value, which
generic_drop_inode checks in order to call generic_delete_inode, we
simply circumvent the check by redirecting the flow thusly:
iput_final -> ecryptfs_drop_inode -> generic_delete_inode
I don't see a problem with doing that, but perhaps there is? Please
elaborate if so.
