I think this can happen due to this:
  
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5127
Think about two adjacent regular timer interrupts. Now consider the first one 
is handled very late (indeed even after the second interrupt already 
occoured). Then will see two "lost" ticks.
Now directly the second timer interrupt handler is executed and, well it sees 
there has _nearly_ no time passed, so no "lost" ticks are reported.
I think this could explain it, right?!
