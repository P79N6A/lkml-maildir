in a fairly recent posting, i clarified that a lot of the problem
seemed to be that many of my modules were simply not being loaded
on demand.  not only the USB stuff, but even the vfat module so
i could mount my windows partition.
i finally went back and just built all this stuff into the kernel,
and solved most (not quite all) of the problems.  i find this
kind of surprising -- i've never had to do this before.
and, to answer your question above, before i did all this, to
get my zip drive to work, i modprobe'd usbcore and usb-storage
manually.  to mount the windows partition, same with modprobe
and vfat.
and it's still a mystery why, before i did this, when i booted
with a USB optical mouse plugged in, it hung after
"Freeing unused kernel memory".  *that* is still a puzzler.
