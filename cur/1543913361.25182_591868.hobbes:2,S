This isn't really a regression -- it's been like this for years. It's a
non-functional configuration which doesn't really make sense, and would
only crop up with randconfig (or crack).
Linus was offered the patch a few weeks ago, but didn't take it -- it's
not really a priority for 2.6.23. It's in my git tree and will be pushed
when the 2.6.24 merge window opens.
