Well, yes, probably simple performance test with and without will
clarify the things.

Clone is needed since tcp expects to own the skb and frees it
unconditionally via __kfree_skb().
What is the best solution for the data corruption bug? To copy the data
all the time or implement own allocator to be used in alloc_skb and
friends to allocate the head? I think it can be done transparently for
the drivers. I can volunteer for this :)
The first one is more appropriate for the current bugfix-only stage,
but this will result in the whole release being too slow.
