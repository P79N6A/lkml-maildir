Yeah, that's what I'm seeing here too.
I'm 99% certain it's not a hardware problem, because:
A) It occurs on multiple motherboards (built in sis900).
B) A soft reboot makes the problem go away.
C) Unplugging the cat 5 cable and plugging it back in makes the problem start 
manifesting, until the next reboot.  (On the systems I've seen it on anyway, 
I haven't tested otherwise healthy boxes to see if I can make them go nuts by 
temporarily unplugging their ethernet cables, but if anybody thinks it would 
help...)
D) The problem itself is packets getting delayed ~10 seconds.  (I think the 
ping corruption warning is just ping getting confused by the delay and 
profound out-of-sequenceness, but in any case 10 second old packets aren't 
interesting so if they went bad in storage it's a side issue...)
That smells like a driver problem to me, but I can't honestly say I have too 
much of a clue in this area.  I'm working with Advanced Clue Substitute at 
best...
