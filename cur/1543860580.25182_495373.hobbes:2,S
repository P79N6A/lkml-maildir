I was never advocating flush_anon_page().  I was suggesting a _new_
cache operation:
   flush_kernel_user_page(page, vma, virt_addr)
which flushes the kernel mapping and the given user mapping.  Just
like flush_dcache_page() but without needing to find the user
mapping(s).
However the cache flushing in kmap/kunmap idea might be cleaner and
better.
