I see, sorry I was wrong. I misread this code a long time ago and I
noticed how the young bit works only now. Infact I always wondered if
the young bit was useful at all. So it was possible to emulate it after
all. However I wonder what happens for PROT_WRITE? How can you make a
mapping only writeable if the mk_young marks it readable? That's why I
misread it without even imagining it was setting the readable bit at the
same time of the young bit.
so while ia64 may not even need to set the young bit, alpha needs it.
