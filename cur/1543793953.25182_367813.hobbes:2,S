I'd doubt if this works with a compressed a.out.  Most changes one would
make to a kernel at the source level will cause changes all over the
generated binary, so rsync will send the whole compressed file anyway.
For example, a few-byte change in size of a function will cause a huge
number of `call xxxxxxxx' opcodes to turn into `call xxxxxxxx+N'.
So I'll need some convincing.  But even if convinced, this seems like an
exceedingly obscure thing that not many people would be interested in.
echo `/usr/bin/gzip --rsyncable $*' > ~/bin/gzip ;)
