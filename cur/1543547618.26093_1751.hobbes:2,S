Hi.
I have changed the interface to mark_buffer_dirty (as per Tigran
Aivazian's suggestion). This impacts a lot of places in the kernel 
(trivially), noticeably the file systems. The URL below points a 
big patch for all these changes. 
(I have been advised against the fine granularity of the patches I
have made as a result of changing the interface of mark_buffers_dirty.
And all the mails they resulted in. Hence this mail and the URL.)
(For some of the file systems I have looked into the code to find
email addresses. If you get this mail and is not actively
maintaining a filesystem anymore, let me apologize.)
So here is instead an URL to the gzipped 'total' patch. Please comment.
(My apologies to the maintainers that get a mail from me twice about
this. But I did not want them to miss the URL below.)
