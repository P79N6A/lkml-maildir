so you want the conversion to only store the pointer (if any) for the
sigevent in the iocb, rather than the whole sigevent, right? This is an
argument that has technical sense and that I can happily buy for having
a different iocb. However your argument also depends having I/O
completion notification via signal is the common case or not. I guess in
theory it should be the common case for software designed for best
performance.

sure, that's why it's so slow. This applies to
read/writes/exceptions/interrupts and everything else kernel side.
