If somebody wants to implement this tar test, be aware that gnu tar tries to be extra smart, so
it fstat()s the output and if its equal to /dev/null, then no files are read at all, only
directory tree is traversed.
So one really needs to use something like "tar cf - /path | cat >/dev/null" to get
meaningful results.
