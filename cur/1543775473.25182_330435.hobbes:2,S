A dirty page is being written back, but the userspace server needs to
allocate memory to complete the request.  But the allocation will
block, since there's no more free memory.

User does unlink("/mnt/userfs/file").  Userspace server receives
request to unlink "/file".  Then the daemon does
unlink("/mnt/userfs/file").  This will deadlock on i_sem.

Possibly.

Because, I can well imagine a synthetic filesystem, where file
data/metadata change aribitrarily.  In this case the timeout heuristic
in NFS is not useful.
In fact with NFS it's often a PITA, that it doesn't want to refresh a
file's data/metatata, which I _know_ has changed on the server.

I think the p9 protocol is suffering from trying to be too generic.
The FUSE kernel interface is probably slightly tied to the linux VFS,
and would present problems if trying to port to other *NIX or god
forbid some other OS family altogether.
That may seem like a drawback, but I don't think it is:
   - people are encouraged to use the FUSE library API instead of the
     raw kernel interface
   - if it will be ported to other systems, even the kernel interface
     could probably be made compatible, only at the loss of
     simplicity/performance.
> Plus NFS and v9fs work across the network...
Yes.  I consider that a drawback.  FUSE does data transfer very
efficiently (single copy), without the heavy network infrastructure
being in the way.
