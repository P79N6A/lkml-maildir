Removing this kthread won't measurably move us farther away from that
goal either.
It's currently under CONFIG_CIFS_EXPERIMENTAL, which would be fine if
it actually did something. It doesn't though -- it just wakes up tasks
that don't need to be woken up.
I have no issue with a kthread that does useful work, but why not remove
this kthread out of the mainline code for now and just plan to put it
back when it actually has something useful to do?
The patch that removes it will live in perpetuity in git. It'll be a
trivial matter to revert it when you're ready to have the kthread do
real work.
