Hello,
I want to preface this mail by saying I 'm coming from a Windows background and
am still thinking along those lines. If this is a dumb idea let me know. 
Can anyone tell me if a method exists for saving device driver state during
shutdown.  It seems to me that there may be instances where devices might need
to save some state information (in my case, audio mixer settings) during
shutdown.  Searching through the kernel sources and various on-line references 
I didn't see anything like this.  Does anyone think this is a good idea?  If
not, does another method exists for saving state, for example an ioctl
interface to a ring 3 component?
Thanks in advance,
Joe C
