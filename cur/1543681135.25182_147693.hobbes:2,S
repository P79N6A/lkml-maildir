Subject: Remove net drivers depending on OBSOLETE

The following three net drivers depend in both 2.4 and 2.5 on 
CONFIG_OBSOLETE:
- FMV18X
- SEEQ8005
- SK_G16
Since CONFIG_OBSOLETE is never set they are not selectable.
Is there any reason why they should stay in the kernel or would you 
accept a patch that removes these drivers?
