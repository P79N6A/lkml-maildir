Currently, mbcache is used only for xattr on ext2/ext3 and reiserfs.
In other words, only one type of mbcache is used per-filesystem.
So any problems don't happen without the patch I sent.
But, for example when someone use mbcache as another purpose on ext3,
The crash will be caused by using mb_cache_shrink().
Therefore, I think your patch should not be committed until
mbcache will be limited to use only type per-filesystem.
