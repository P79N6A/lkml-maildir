	You are entirely wrong.
	In fact, running multiple threads on different processors has major cache
benefits. Your I/O code and your processing code may not fit in the L2 cache
at the same time, but one might fit in one processor's L2 cache while the
other fits in another's.
	The caches have no difficuties at all with shared data. The cache coherency
protocol allows the same byte of data to be cached by more than one
processor at a time.
