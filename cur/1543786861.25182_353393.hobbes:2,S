Well they're in -mm now, you can put them in your RT tree until they're
in mainline... I guess realistically, 2.6.15. They should blow up fairly
quickly if there are any problems with them, but they simply need a bit
of testing on all architectures which I cannot do and I suspect even -mm
isn't tested on at least half of them.
