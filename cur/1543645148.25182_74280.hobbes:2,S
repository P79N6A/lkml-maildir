I will say that anything that requires more after-the-fact matching of
files on disk to the running system strikes me as a very bad idea.
I have had to do to many really ugly things with boot disks and old system
images just to keep things running at different times, I don't want to
make ANY assumptions that the currently running kernel+modules match
anything on the system.
I'm also the type that wants to compile monolithic kernels if possible to
eliminate any posibility of module mismatches so this is something that
I'll probably only use on my laptop so take it for what little it's worth
:-)
I've also been burned a few times by old utilities on a system when
installing a new kernel (I had a system running for a couple years where
ifconfig reported tx packets in the tx errors slot after an upgrade) and
anything that can reduce the possiblity of this is good.
