No, it doesn't. But it wants a specific serial line speed and mode.

Not widespread. It's a family of evaluation modules for I2C/SMBus
chips. They will mainly be used to develop and test chip drivers, I
suppose. But OTOH, I'm not sure how it matters. We're in year 2007, I
pretty much doubt that any of the devices supported by inputattach is
still in widespread use. As a matter of fact, inputattach has been
broken in Suse for half of the supported devices for almost two years
now, and I couldn't find any bug report about it.

One problem I foresee is that the dump mode sets the port to 2400 bps,
while my evaluation module wants 1200 bps.
Another problem is that the dump mode of inputattach doesn't appear to
create a serio device. Probably not very surprising, as dump_init()
never returns. So I don't think I can use that.
