From that page:
   UPX and the UCL library are free software; you can redistribute them
   and/or modify them under the terms of the GNU General Public License as
   published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of
   the License, or (at your option) any later version.
Seems GPL2 to me. I haven't read all of the rest of the page, but
that'd either be dual licensing stuff, or further restrictions, which
would be in contradiction with the GPL.
