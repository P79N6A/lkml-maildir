I have contacted Philips regarding the closed source part of the driver, 
but I'm still waiting for an answer.
I can't "steal" Nemosoft's work. I don't even have any recent version of 
this driver on my system, apart from the code in the 2.6.8 kernel, and he 
has removed any packages from his website. So as long as he refuses to 
give permission to reuse his code, we (as in the users of this driver) are 
pretty much screwed.
