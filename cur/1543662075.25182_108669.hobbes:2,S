Well, currently, there's only like 3 entries in the table - two clones
and a null. So for i=0 and i=1, 'i<vendor_id' happens to be true, and we
compare that to a zero. Then for i=2, i is greater than the terminating
null in the table, and we compare THAT to zero.

True.  Notice I said "what was intended", not "what is idiomatic". ;)
