Definitely a kernel bug.
Could you please test 2.6.0-test3?  If that has the same problem then
some initial steps would be:
- Boot the kernel with the "nmi_watchdog=1" option on the kernel boot
  command line.  (It needs to be an SMP-compiled kernel for this to work. 
  Or one which has the local APIC enabled in config)
- Make sure that /proc/sys/kernel/sysrq was set to `1' after booting.
- Can you still ping the machine after it hangs up?
- Type ALT-SYSRQ-T and/pr ALT-SYSRQ-P on the keyboard, see if you get a trace.
- ALT-SYSRQ-M may be interesting too (memory stats)
If the nmi watchdog doesn't generate a trace then the sysrq keys should do
so.
If the above does not provide us with enough information to solve the bug
then the next step would be for you to provide sufficient material for a
kernel developer to reproduce the problem.
Thanks.
