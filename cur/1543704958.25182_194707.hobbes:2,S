After doing some more digging, I don't think __devinitdata is a problem
anymore.
There seem to be two scenarios where we look at the PCI device ID tables:
- when a new PCI device is added
- when the drivers newid file is written to
The first case should only ever occur if CONFIG_HOTPLUG is set (and
indeed we only compile PCMCIA/Cardbus if it is.)
The second case is disabled if CONFIG_HOTPLUG is not set.
Therefore, I think marking PCI device ID tables with __devinitdata
should theoretically be fine, but marking them with __initdata is
most definitely unsafe.
