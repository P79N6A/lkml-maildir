I will submit a requirest to change this behavior in the spec, but I am not
terribly optimistic.  This has been specified for a very long time and there
might be applications taking advantage of the ability to shut listing off.
At this time, let's leave this as is.  A well written application should specify
the listen backlog anyway, otherwise it's depending on the "may" language in the
Posix spec and will not get consistent behavior across different systems.
