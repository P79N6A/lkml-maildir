I've got a RAID-0 setup and suppose a slowest disk io performance (like 300kb/s) during
CD recording is due to the recorder being on the same ide controller  as
my hard disks although md5summing is as fast as usual and can even  
starve the recorder causing the recording to fail.
What I'd like to know is why the system completely
freezes for the time a CD is being fixated. Here's the output of
vmstat for the final stages of fixation:

As you can see from the last entry as soon as the the recording ends  the system 
catches up, as it were, with all the processes that were cut off from the processor. 
I'm currently using 2.4.20-ck2 because I thought the patches would cure the 
condition but they've made no difference. Could anyone, please, offer an explanation?
