In 2.2, the reason for large memory support on x86 giving slightly less
than the 1 or 2 GB selected is that the kernel requires a portion of the
virtual address space for things like vmalloc and ioremap.  Recent
versions of 2.3 have removed this restriction with the addition of
CONFIG_BIGMEM, which can map memory beyond what the kernel can address
into process' requests for anonymous pages.
