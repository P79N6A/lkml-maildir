I'm afraid you might've misunderstood the (rather caustic, sometimes)
general nature of comments on lkml :-) But I guess you only have
everything to gain if you use features that have been developed (and
are being *maintained* in the current kernel) that already do the kind
of stuff you want done.
You might have your reasons for being so anxious to avoid any
userspace at all, but quoting famous words, continuing to maintain
Kcli out-of-tree could soon turn out to be an act for
self-flagellation for you :-)
