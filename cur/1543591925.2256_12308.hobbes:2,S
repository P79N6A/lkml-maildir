True enough.

No - I'm merely pointing out that it's sufficient. And I'm pretty sure we
want to make additional control or stream interfaces the exception rather
than the rule. And having a standard read and write protocol of some sort
for ctl devices is more or less mandatory, otherwise they will all work
differently. This is not to say driver writers aren't allowed to depart
from it, just that it'll be more work if they do.

I'm guessing some sort of poll or select on the refresh device, assuming a
single-threaded app. But no, I've never used 9 nor am I especially
interested in exploring it in depth, given its license and lack of
community.
