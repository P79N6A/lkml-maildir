I have recently pondered usage of Request Tracker  for this
kind of tasks.   The problem with "post to the list" is that
sometimes things slip thru without anybody catching them.
Integrating  linux-kernel  and  RT ...   urgh..  result would
be quite ugly.  (Flame wars and out-of-topic threads going on
as requests...)

That needs merely message arriving to the list.
Ok, responding so that the response appears also
at the bug db is another story.

Bugzilla could be adapted to this use:
  - Bugs are to be assigned to, e.g.   linux-net/netdev   list
  - Everybody can comment on them at bugme (after signing on)
  - Only some meta-admin (and original bug creator) can
    alter status (e.g. mark as RESOLVED)
Having plenty of bugme group admins (half a dozen or so) to do
the initial bugzilla assigment work, those people taking the task
seriously, and everybody of them going en masse to assign arrived
things.  That way people can have time off - as long as they
coordinate among themselves.
The minus (and plus) is, of course, that the entire discussion
flowing at the list doesn't go to the bug database, but that
doesn't invalidate mechanisms existence as a way to avoid
slipping things thru the cracks.

I thought you don't need to login to see things in bugzilla ?
.. and proved it by looking into bugme..
   
http://bugme.osdl.org/show_bug.cgi?id=853
In addition to assinging an OWNER to the bug, there should be
automatic assignment of   linux-net  or  netdev   as  Cc,  IMO...
That will handle the "publish widely" issue that DaveM is
complaining about.
