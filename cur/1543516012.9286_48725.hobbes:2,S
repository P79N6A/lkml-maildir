I looked into the kernel sources a little deeper and found the
following:
- sys_tz.tz_dsttime never seems to be set to anything. As far as
  I can tell, it's value is always zero, no matter what date is
  set.
- It's value is used in fat iso and hpfs file systems.
- the intended semantics of "sys_tz.tz_dsttime" are somewhat
  unclear. A comment in "include/linux/time.h" simply says
  "minutes west of Greenwich". It seems natural (particularly
  since there is another field "tz_dsttime") to assume, that
  this contains the offset to UTC _with no DST setting in
  effect_. It's usage in the sources is usually consistent with
  that view. On the other hand, hfs for example depends on
  tz_minuteswest containing the _current_ offset to UTC.
- the actual value at least on my machine (linux 2.2.13/glic
  2.0.7) is alway 120, no matter whether or not DST is currently
  in effect (which, together with tz_dsttime being always zero,
  produces the observed effect, that timestamps on fat
  file-systems are only correct for summer months).
I personally don't know any good solution for this chaos. Any
kind of clearly defined behavior (like tz_minuteswest and
timestamps for files on affected file-systems always reflecting
local time or UTC and ignoring DST) would IMHO be better than the
current situation. 
Unfortunately, this would mean that a user level program would
have to find out what kind of file system a file is on (and of
course, what OS - maybe even what OS version - it is running on)
in order to know how to interpret file dates. Probably the only
way to get a consistent behavior independent of the file system
type would require the kernel to figure out the DST settings for
timestamps on such file-systems - certainly pretty ugly, but
maybe still preferable...
At least for me the whole thing is not just an academical
question but a real problem - a program (actually, a bunch of
programs) I have written just broke with the, because I had not
realized in time how unreliable file dates on fat file systems
under Linux are: The same vfat file system is (1) first written
to under Linux, (2) then under Win95, (3) then under Linux again.
With the end of DST in Europe suddenly the ctimes of all files
written in (2) appear to be an hour older than those in (1), even
though they are actually newer ...
