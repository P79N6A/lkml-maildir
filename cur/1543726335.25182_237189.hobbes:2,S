is bogus, please revert it.  fdomain_cs drives a PCMCIA card.  Obviously
you can plug a PCMCIA card into a PowerPC.  So the correct fix for this
is either to have ppc provide isa_readb() et al, or for the driver to
be converted to use ioremap().
We should probably hang __deprecated tags on the isa_* functions.

the nation that is attacked, and every man will be glad of those
conscience-soothing falsities, and will diligently study them, and refuse
to examine any refutations of them; and thus he will by and by convince 
himself that the war is just, and will thank God for the better sleep 
he enjoys after this process of grotesque self-deception." -- Mark Twain
