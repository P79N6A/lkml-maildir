I'm wondering if processing in generic_file_direct_IO() shouldn't look 
more like
sys_fsync()?  When I add to generic_file_direct_IO() a call to 
f_op->fsync() between the calls to filemap_fdatawrite() and 
filemap_fdatawait(), the test Daniel and I have been running no longer 
fails for me.  This change would also seem consistent with 2.4, but I 
could be way off base.
