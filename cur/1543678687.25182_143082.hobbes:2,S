Hi(gh)!
So, has we can see in your dmesg, you don't test new acpi,
you are report problems from old acpi.
Well, can you send the /var/log/dmesg for ACPI: Core Subsystem version
200306...
you can try to see if DSDT has problems,without stop your production.
Get last iasl (ACPI CA - Unix Build Environment )in
http://developer.intel.com/technology/iapc/acpi/downloads.htm
 cd compiler;make
after this
cat /proc/acpi/dsdt > acpi_dsdt.dat
./iasl  -d acpi_dsdt.dat
./iasl -tc acpi_dsdt.dsl
and see your dsdt in bios are ok or not.
