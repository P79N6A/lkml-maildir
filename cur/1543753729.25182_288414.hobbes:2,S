No, the program text is located between 0x00100000 and 0x001c6000  (no 
shared libs)
0xffffe6xx is READ|WRITE data, mapped on Hugetlb fs
extract from /proc/pid/maps
ff400000-100400000 rw-s 82000000 00:0b 12960938

Maybe, but I want to say that in this case, the address 'prefetched' is 
valid (ie mapped read/write by the program, on a huge page too)
