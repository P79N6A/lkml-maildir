Yeah that's unfortunate, but I think a large portion of the problem
(if they are anything the same) has been narrowed down to some over
eager wakeup balancing for which there are a number of proposed
patches.
But in this case I was more worried about getting the groundwork done
for handling the multicore multicore systems that everyone will soon
be using rather than several % performance regression on TPC-C (not
to say that I don't care about that at all)... I don't see the irony.
But let's move this to another thread if it is going to continue. I
would be happy to discuss scheduler problems.

You can't what? What doesn't work? If you have no hard limits set,
then the frag patches can't guarantee anything either.
You can't have it both ways. Either you have limits for things or
you don't need any guarantees. Zones handle the former case nicely,
and we currently do the latter case just fine (along with the frag
patches).
