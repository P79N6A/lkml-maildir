The fix for it is included in current Mandrake cooker. As I already
said, I do not like it (the fix is to pretend we have media when we have
none) but it is the only possible way given current partition layer
design it seems.
I would prefer that partition layer registered .../disc for removable
media irrespectively of whether media is inserted or not, but well ...
it's up to other people to decide.
