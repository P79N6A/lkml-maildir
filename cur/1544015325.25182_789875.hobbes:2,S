That could be done in a separate patch for waitid itself, and its a 
simple change to propagate it through waitfd (just one less EINVAL 
case). In terms of waitfd we'd be supersetting the interface, so its no 
big deal to add. In terms of waitid I'd have to check and make sure that 
we wouldn't be breaking compliance by allowing it to return something 
different on every call (this would likely affect cases where 
waitid(WNOWAIT) was used even in a normal fashion as well).
