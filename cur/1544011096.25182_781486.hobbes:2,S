Sounds good.  I forsee a lot of patches to fix all this up :)

I don't think EFAULT is appropriate here - there was no fault.
And EIO to me implies some problem with a hardware device.

And ENOMEM should be reserved for page allocation exhaustion.
It's a bit presumptuous, but perhaps EBUSY here?

Well.. what would cause this to come about?
Perhaps BUG() is more appropriate ;)

I don't really like the practice of returning what are clearly
filesystem-related errnos just because they're kinda sorta conceptually
similar to what actually happened.
Again, what could actually cause this to happen?  The device doesn't
have any memory resources?  So it's busted?  EIO or ENODEV?

yup.
But really, the drivers should be doing far less of this
errno-guessing.  In the majority of cases (platform_get_resource,
ioremap, request_mem_region from your examples) the core kernel
function should have returned an IS_ERR value and all the driver needs
to do is to return it.
But we screwed that up again and again.
