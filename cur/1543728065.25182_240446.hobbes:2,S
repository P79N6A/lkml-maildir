printk() seems to only have a few possible effects. I just tried mdelay()
for the delay effect and not much appears to have happened. I'll probably
try fiddling with schedule(), yield(), and local_irq_enable() and so on
next. Your advice is very much like what I have in mind for possibilities,
except I consider the messed up completion logic ruled out since backing
out the completion removal part of the printk() "fix"  didn't break it.
