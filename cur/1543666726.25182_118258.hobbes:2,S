Hi Pavel.
You need to remember that this is infrastructure for later. I tried it
other ways and would have needed a number of calls to drain local pages.
Perhaps I'm taking the wrong approach, trying to feed a patch at a time
when you can't see how it all fits together. If you like, I'll send a
'whole kit and caboodle' patch as soon as I get the last bugs ironed
out. I have it suspending and resuming at the moment, but have one last
bug to iron out that's stopping me getting back from
do_suspend_lowlevel. It's just a matter of time, and then that will be
fixed. I could send you a monster patch then :> (I'll be posting it
somewhere anyway - I'll want others to test it, of course).
Regards,
Nigel
