    I only use compose keys for a bunch of characters like © (copyright
mark) for example. For any other I use dead diacriticals (for example,
to write the accented chars for my mother tongue).

    I have my keymap modified for that, and I use it as a last resort.
If I find myself using AltGr+hex (that's the key combo I use), I usually
put that character in a compose.
    Thanks for the info, I'm very happy to hear that it works :)))
