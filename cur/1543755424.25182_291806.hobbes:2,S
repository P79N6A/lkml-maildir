Thanks for integrating the page zero stuff. If you are zeroing pages
before their are fragmented then we may not need scrubd anymore. On the
other hand, larger than necessary zeroing may be performaned in the hot
code paths which may result in sporadically longer delays during
allocation (well but then the page_allocator can generate these delays for
a number of reasons).

Would it not be better to zero the global 2^MAX_ORDER pages by the scrub
daemon and have a global zeroed page list? That way you may avoid zeroing
when splitting pages?
