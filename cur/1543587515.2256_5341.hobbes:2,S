Al,
Not meaning to offend, but how could you know what everyone 
who uses Linux needs in every instance?  NT, NetWare, etc. all
expose these types of APIs for Backup and anti-virus software,
etc.  The APIs in question are the very calls user space apps
call through the syscall to indicate who is using a device. 
Sure, I can send blind I/O requests to a device and I guess 
someone running fdisk in user space can blow the device away from beneath 
me since I have no way of locking those partitions I exclusively
own and stopping this is these apis are removed and modules 
cannot call them.
