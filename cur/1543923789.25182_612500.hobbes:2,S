I tried with the git patch plus changing the penultimage argument from
0x1 to 0.
The switch of the modem is still not done automatically, but calling
huaweiAktBbo does effect the switch.
In my tests I did NOT reboot since usb-storage was compiled as module
(usbserial and option fix in the kernel). But I made sure that I loaded
the right (the module with the patched code) after removing the old one.
Best wishes
