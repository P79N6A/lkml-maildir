I'm not opposed to consolidating this code, but would it be possible to
do so in a more straightforward way, without passing in a callback
function?  E.g. a single __posix_lock_file_wait that just took an inode
instead of a filp and called __posix_lock_file() could be called from
both posix_lock_file_wait() and locks_mandatory_locked, right?

OK.  Might be better to submit this as a separate patch, though.
