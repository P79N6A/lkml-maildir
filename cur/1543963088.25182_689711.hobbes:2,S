I can't figure it out either.  Unless schedule() is broken somehow ...
but that should have shown up with semaphore-sleepers.c, shouldn't it?
One other difference between semaphore-sleepers and the new generic code
is that in effect, semaphore-sleepers does a little bit of spinning
before it sleeps.  That is, if up() and down() are called more-or-less
simultaneously, the increment of sem->count will happen before __down
calls schedule().  How about something like this:

Maybe it'd be enough to test it once ... or maybe we should use
spin_is_locked() ... Ingo?
