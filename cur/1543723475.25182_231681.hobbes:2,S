The code is copying the task name from 'c' to 'buf' one character
at a time.  It is then 'post processing' the characters.  Currently,
the post processing is based on the value of c which is part of the
source string (task->curr).  However, it is possible for the source
string to change during this copy (think exec).  In such a case I
think it is better to base the 'post processing' on the character
that already has been safely been copied to the target string rather
than the character in the source string which might have changed.
