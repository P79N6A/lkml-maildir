I have another kaffeine [0.8.4]/xine-lib [1.1.6] problem with CFS for you :)
Under load (compiling any Qt app. or kernel with -j1 or -j2) audio always goes 
sync with time (and i'm sure it never skips) but video starts slowdown and 
loses its sync with audio (like for the 10th sec. of a movie, audio is at 
10th sec. also, but the shown video is from 7th sec.). 
After some time video suddenly wants to sync with audio and starts to play 
really fast (like fast-forward) and syncs with audio. But it will lose its 
audio/video sync after a while and loop continues like that.
I also reproduced that behaviour with CFS-13, i'm not sure its reproducible 
with mainline cause for a long time i only use CFS (but i'm pretty sure that 
problem not exists or not hit me with CFS-1 to CFS-11). And its only 
reproducible with some load and mplayer plays same video without losing its 
audio/video sync with same load.
Cheers
