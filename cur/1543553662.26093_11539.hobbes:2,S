Jeff, I recompiled test10 with all kernel ISA PNP options disabled, and it
successfully
booted.  But I also upgraded binutils to ver 2.10, (which I know is bad for
for bug
hunting, but I wanted to get this system up ASAP).  So I guess the conclusion
to draw is that there *may* be a bug in the kernel ISA PNP code.  In any
event, this no longer appears to be a problem for me (assuming I get the user
PNP stuff to work), and no one else has reported this problem (that I am aware
of).  Many thanks for your insights.
