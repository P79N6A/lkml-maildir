Hey List,
Little question: With many modules I'm still seeying the MOD_DEC_USE_COUNT is 
deprecated message. I've checked the changes that have been done earlier, and 
they usually just consist of removing these lines. If so, I'm more than 
willing to "search and destroy" those and send 'em over to the patch monkey, 
but if what I'm saying is totally idiotic just slap me ;p
