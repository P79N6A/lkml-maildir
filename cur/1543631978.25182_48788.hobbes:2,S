Hi all,
after sorting out my sk_buff problem [turned out to be problems with
pcmcia-cs-3.1.33's own include files, which throw away some of the kernel's
config options, thus affecting struct sk_buff declaration] i am now
investigating some things in orinoco.c of 2.4.18, which seems almost
identical to the one from pcmcia-cs
My concern is, if it is really necessary to do the whole rx work in the
interrupt handler, or a bottom half could be used here?
I ask because like this, the interrupt is set for about 800us in a
whole-frame (MTU) receive, which IMHO is not really desirable. I have to
admit i still did not really understand the use of FIDs, so i am not sure,
but couldn't this be taken out of the interrupt handler itself?
(Of course, i can simply implement and try it, but as i am absolutely
not aware about the use of FIDs, i do not want to risk introducing any
nice subtle bugs...)
Regards,
Wolfgang
