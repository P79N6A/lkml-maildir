With is_prefetch:
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
   2782       4       0    2786     ae2 arch/i386/mm/fault.o
Without is_prefetch:
 text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
   2446       4       0    2450     992 arch/i386/mm/fault.o
Difference 332 bytes
If you start your attack on 332 bytes then IMHO you have your priorities wrong ;-)
The main reason I'm really against this is that currently the P4 kernels work
fine on Athlon. Just when is_prefetch is not integrated in them there will 
be an mysterious oops once every three months in the kernel in prefetch
on Athlon.
That would be bad. The alternative would be to prevent the P4 kernel
from booting on the Athlon at all, but doing that for 332 bytes
would seem a bit silly.

P.S.: If you really want to shrink 2.6 I would start with making sysfs optional.
That would likely help much more than micro optimizing non bloated parts.
