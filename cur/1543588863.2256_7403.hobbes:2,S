If you are making a personal device, like an "appliance", there is no 
need to patch the kernel - at least not to remove the concept of users.  
Instead, change your startup scripts.  In that situation, you will have 
a custom application that is automatically started at boot and runs with
enough privileges to do whatever it needs.
The user never sees a login prompt.  If you want a Windows-95 style
setup for Linux, you can do that too - but don't run as root!  Just have
the startup scripts auto-login as an unprivileged user.
Kernel patches to do this are completely unnecessary, and a bad idea.
Permissions are important to have on an appliance-like system, as they 
can be used to help prevent the end user from accessing the guts of the 
system which should be off limits for them.
