If Sally, Joe and Bill need rw access to a directory, and Joe and Bill
are using existing userland (any OS I'd seen), then Sally can easily
fuck them into the next month and not in a good way.
_That_ is the real problem.  Until that is solved (i.e. until all
userland is written up to the standards allegedly followed in writing
suid-root programs wrt hostile filesystem modifications) NO mechanism
will help you.  ACLs, huge groups, whatever - setups with that sort
of access allowed are NOT SUSTAINABLE with the current userland(s).
