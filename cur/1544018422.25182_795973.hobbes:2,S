Are people ignoring the fact that there _are_ people stepping up and
doing real work on these drivers?  Look at all of the cleanup patches
that went into 2.6.29-rc1 in drivers/staging.  There were hundreds.
And I already have 75+ staging cleanup patches in -next right now.
This work is being done right now, is it somehow being missed?
Yeah, compiler warnings are annoying, I totally agree, that is why it is
very hard to enable the staging tree.  To do so, you really have to want
to, and I'm eagerly taking any patch sent to me to do this work.
thanks,
