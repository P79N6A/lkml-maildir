Subject: 2.4.15: FS corruption on EXT2

Hi,
I've just been testing 2.4.15 on my NetWinder (which was running 2.4.15-pre5
quite happily - its built several kernels and been through a fair number of
reboot cycles with that version).
With 2.4.15, I can now 100% reproduce every time filesystem corruption of
an ext2 filesystem, specifically in /var/lock/subsys/.
/var/lock/subsys contains a load of 0 byte files, one for each daemon that
is started by the redhat-like boot scripts.  On shutdown they're removed.
After a second boot with 2.4.15, all the names are still present in the
directory, rm complains with:
	rm: cannot remove `/var/lock/subsys/xyz': Input/output error
stracing rm reveals that lstat of a file in /var/lock/subsys/ returns -EIO.
Trying to get a directory listing results in every single file giving an
input/output error.
This is just a heads up - several people are already looking into it.
