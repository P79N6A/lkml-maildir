Fixed.

I thought HOTPLUG affected the user's ability to add and remove USB devices
while the kernel is running. It would seem that I misunderstood (or, in less
formal terms, was wrong :)).
Attached is a patch against 2.5.40 with __dev* uses removed and the error
checking in the open routine fixed.
Let me know if the ordering of the video_unregister_device and tasklet_kill
is still an issue.
Thanks,
John
