Ok, I found the responsible hunk, though I haven't any idea why it would
make a difference:

	+       set_user(0, 1);
		/* Give kmod all effective privileges.. */
		curtask->euid = curtask->fsuid = 0;
This hunk shows up for the first time in 2.4.18-pre7-ac3, which shows
the behavior, while prior versions do not.  If I revert this hunk from
ac3, I get the behavior I expect.  It also fixes my problem when I
revert this from 2.4.19-pre2-ac2, which is where I first saw the
problems.
I don't see why mozilla would even touch this path of execution, so I
don't know why it would make a difference there, but it makes some sense
in the case of xmms, as my sound support is in modules.  But it shows up
both places.
I also checked to see if the CLONE_THREAD change in kernel/fork.c in the
same patch had any effect, because that looked more relevant to
threading, but it didn't.
So now I guess I get to help you reproduce it on your end.  Let me know
what you need from me.
Thanks,
Danek
