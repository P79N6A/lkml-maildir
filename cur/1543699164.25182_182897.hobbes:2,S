I think the root cause of this problem is that pcnet32_set_multicast_list()
dumps the entire TX ring on the floor (as a side effect of calling
pcnet32_restart()). I don't think dev->set_multicast_list() is supposed to
do that.

I've been wondering about this too with the recent netpoll patches. Many
(including pcnet32) implement the poll controller simply as
	disable_irq (dev->irq);
	driver_interrupt_handler (dev->irq, dev, NULL);
	enable_irq (dev->irq);
If the interrupt handler calls dev_kfree_skb_any(), could you then run into
this kind of problem? Or is it just if you call spin_lock_irq*() that you
have a problem?
