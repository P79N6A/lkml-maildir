So how many OSes is it ported to currently?  The problem is not that it
doesn't work but that it's really hard to maintain.  And remember that
this maintaince overhead is not just for Hans but for everyone that does
VFS-level work.  Unless of course we get a blanko permission to break it
as soon as fixing the mess becomes non-trivial.

compression or encryption must sit below the pagecache to work nicely,
and this hint things that usually sit at the pagecache level.  But let's
assume you have a valid use for different file_operations, why don't you
simply add in different file_operations instead of adding another
internal dispatch layer?
