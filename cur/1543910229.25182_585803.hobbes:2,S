Well, obviously with TSO and LRO the packets that the stack sends or
receives are not the same as what's on the wire.  Whether that breaks
your wonderful networking facilities or not depends on the specifics
of the particular facility I guess -- for example shaping is clearly
broken by TSO.  (And people can wonder what the packet trains TSO
creates do to congestion control on the internet, but the netdev crowd
has already decided that TSO is "good" and RDMA is "bad")
