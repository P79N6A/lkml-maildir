Not to mention that this scheme still won't allow access to more
than 4GB without a CR3 change and/or page directory pointer table change.
The 36-bit address extensions still require kernel intervention
to access more than 4GB at one time, as the segment registers only
accomodate a 32-bit flat address space.
PAE partitions the 4GB flat address space into 4 1GB sections, each
of which can be changed by altering the entry in the page directory pointer
table [see section 3.8.3 ia sw developers manual, vol. 3].  There is no
way to access more than at any one point in time, no matter what ldt
entries you have or what segment overrides are used.

Certain applications, like oracle, really run well if you give them
loads of RAM. (As pointed out above, you can't give it more than
4GB at one time, but you can use a windowing scheme with kernel
intervention to map a window into a larger than 4GB shared memory
segment, for example, to the application.   Unixware does this
to utilize the additional memory provided by PAE on ia32 arch).

Interestingly enough, NT currently holds the record for best TPC-C
results on the intel architecture; in large part because it provides
a mechanism (whether it is grody or not) to provide access to that
cache space for SQL server.

This is arrogance at best, and foolishness at worst.   Instead of 
belittleing this competetive operating system (in this case, 
somewhat unfairly), how about concentrating on how we can 
overcome the often misleading perceptions that folks have 
of open source operating systems, such as linux, in 
a positive fashion?   In fact, linux does have some shortcomings, 
as does NT.   No operating system (except perhaps SVR4/MK from 
Unisys :-) is perfect.

Man O' Man!!!! You really can't mean this.  You are relegating 
linux to the hobbiest market with statements like this.   It is clear
that to compete in the commercial marketplace, you have to provide
what the customer wants, not what you think the customer needs. If 
the customer is Informix, for instance (just try to tell <name db company> 
they need to rewrite their application because linux won't support PAE
because someone thinks it is ugly).
