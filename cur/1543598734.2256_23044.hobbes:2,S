ok here's a reply from our developer:
--------------------
probably the best way to reproduce the environment would be to write a
C++ class that has a method on it that goes and maps a file, touches
all the memory in that file, and then returns.  add another method
that takes a number and returns that same number.  then run that code
through swig and write a mod_perl interface to call the first method
then call the second method in a loop (10 times should be good), then
storable::freeze an array of results and print it to stdout.
this ought to emulate the kinds of things we do there.  you might
actually have that method take a number and return a string (literal)
instead of a number, just to exercise swig a little more.
--------------------
Note that the file must be large; maybe 50% greater than physical RAM.
Jeff
