back then the argument (not mine btw) was that /usr on a lot of machines
is RO (I think debian has an option for that) so that sysadmins there
compile stuff in /root. /lib/modules however IS standardized and needs
to be writable to install a new kernel so making a symlink to the real
place there isn't too bad. In addition it already is the only directory
with per kernel files.. adding a second one was judged not needed. It
has to be somewhere. /lib/modules/ or /usr/src.. who cares. Linus made
the final call and everybody complies with it since then, just because
it doesn't matter THAT much. It just needs to be SOMEWHERE standard and
/lib/modules suffices so far it seems.
