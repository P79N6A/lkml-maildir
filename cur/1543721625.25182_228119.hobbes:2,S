Umm. They said they're linux-2.6.x based ... ie they're BASED on 2.6,
not identical. No major vendor ships completely virgin source.

I think you're getting somewhat carried away. Yes, there are lots of mods.
Most of them are merged back into mainline already (as of 2.6.7).

So what's broken then? Specifically which kernel interface are you 
calling that has a broken behaviour?

They didn't say it was 2.6.5, they said it was based on it.

In what way?

I'd be more inclined to suspect you're relying on some behaviour that isn't
really defined ...
And no, I don't work for SuSE.
