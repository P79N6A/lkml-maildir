That's nitpicking!  That the kernel init routine runs after a process is
started is an accident (and I'm not sure it's true, but what the heck
..).  Where does it say that one can rely on this?
My point is that the disk task queue "just happens".  Maybe some days in
the life of the kernel development it happens in a process context,
and maybe some days it doesn't.  Conceptually, I don't see any necesity
that it should or ought to, and even if it does, I don't see why it
should be expected to run in the context of a particular process, let
alone the one you think it should run in, on, by, from ...

And both of the oranges in front of me look orange. Neverthess, I have
eaten some red oranges.
