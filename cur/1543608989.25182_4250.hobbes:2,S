Perhaps a way around this frequent problem is to make execve() always
reserve a certain minimum amount of space in argv[] even if it is not
filled in with anything.  Then instead a "brick wall" being set at
the end of the space originally used, it can be set at max(space used,
minimum reserved).  This is still userland space, right?  What would
be a reasonable figure for minimum reserved?  Or does ld-linux go
grabbing space right after the end of argv[]?
