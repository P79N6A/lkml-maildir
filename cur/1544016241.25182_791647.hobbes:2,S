Yes and no.

No :)
The problem is, you are probably creating these attributes _after_
userspace has been notified that the device is present, right?  So that
causes a not-so-nice race.
To do this properly, use an attribute group, name it (that will cause it
to show up in a subdirectory), attach it to the device, and then it will
be created automatically when the device is registered with the driver
core, at the proper time to then notify userspace that the device, and
all of its attributes, are present.
Does this help?
