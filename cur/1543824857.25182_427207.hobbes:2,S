The presence of tasks with caps will break smp balancing and smp nice. I 
suspect you could probably provide a reasonable workaround by altering their 
priority bias effect in the raw weighted load in smp nice for soft caps by 
the percentage cpu of the cap. Hard caps provide more "interesting" 
challenges though. I can't think of a valid biasing off hand for them, but at 
least initially using the same logic as soft caps should help.
