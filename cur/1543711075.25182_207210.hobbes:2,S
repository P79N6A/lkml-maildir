I still have a couple of NMI patches in -mm:
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.5-rc1/2.6.5-rc1-mm1/broken-out/nmi_watchdog-local-apic-fix.patch
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.5-rc1/2.6.5-rc1-mm1/broken-out/nmi-1-hz.patch
What should we do with these?
