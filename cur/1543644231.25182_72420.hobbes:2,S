There is more than one industry interested in it. It simply sucks if your
kernel panic only because you remove a SCSI cable. IT also sucks if your
kernel panics only vecause you have a bad block on a Disk.
Companies which build carrier grade Linux Systems (like HP, IBM and SGI _do_
contribute on making Linux an Enterprise System).
So personal I find this project good, and adding the Linux Testing community
is needed. But I dont think that a lot of new APIs is needed in the first
place. (Well, possibly for things like path failover/md somebody needs to
define an actual error handling, like it is done currently), but "debugging"
all drivers by review is needed. On the other hand, the reason this has not
happend just shows us, that it is not trivial to find a second person which
understands hardware's error behaviour.
