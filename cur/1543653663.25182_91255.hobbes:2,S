I've got the same machine. Nice, isn't it?

That's what I do. The linux-wlan-ng prism_pci driver is much stabler on
my machine than the in-kernel code. The only problem is that, depending
on the kernel version you're using, you might have to make small changes
to the code so that it's using the same version of the wireless
extensions.

I have a fine time with 2.4.19-ac4 and linux-wlan-ng 0.1.16-pre1. If you
want to use the in-kernel code, I'd suggest using the newest 2.5 you can
get working -- but you won't have a very easy time with it. The kernel
code seems to have a tendency to drop quite a few packets.

That it typically called a "PLX" card, and both the kernel orinoco
drivers and the linux-wlan-ng drivers support them. Again, I suggest the
linux-wlan-ng modules above the kernel code.
