Actually, no.  Here's my x86 laptop's config space ...

Interrupt Pin is 0x3d and Interrupt Line is 0x3c.  As I explained earlier,
Linux simply never reads Interrupt Line if Interrupt Pin is 0.
Anyway, this doesn't matter too much.  I don't personally care about
NO_IRQ being 0 or -1; that was something benh tried to make me care
about ;-)
So, how about this for a new patch series:
 - Patch 1, same as this series (it just makes sense to bounds-check in
   the irq management functions).
 - Patch 2, add #ifndef NO_IRQ #define NO_IRQ 0 #endif to linux/hardirq.h
 - Patch 3, set dev->irq to NO_IRQ in drivers/pci/probe.c
 - Patch 4, remove custom definition of NO_IRQ from pd6729
 - Patch 5, use NO_IRQ in serial_core
I'll start work on that now, since that fixes the problems I care about
and doesn't negatively affect people with problems I don't care about ;-)
