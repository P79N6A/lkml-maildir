Hmm I do prefer a MORE as to an END, as it will always give predictable
results. The MORE is a performance hit, where as a missing END wont
necessarily be detected until you start looking at latencies.

That's a really good idea! Wont be too much trouble to add, probably the
easiest is to add a 'wait' variable to the ->map() function or something
along those lines.

Probably not.
