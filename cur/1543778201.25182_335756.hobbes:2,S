You should in effect depend on ($original_depends) && (B || C). You'll 
just need to append all (recursive) dependencies in the selecting option.
last_length:=-1; /* impossible value */

		for s in i->unresolved_selects do
			if 0 == |s->unresolved_selects|
			then begin
				add(i->depends, s->depends)
				delete_from(i->unresolved_selects, s)
			end
		if 0 == |i->unresolved_selects|
		then delete_from(options_with_unresolved_selects, i);
	end

That would only result in ugly workarounds. Think about the kernel 
libraries. You'll want to manually select them, and you'll want to 
automatically select them, and you want both to be visible.
