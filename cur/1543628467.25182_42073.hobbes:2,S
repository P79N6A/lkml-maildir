Hope this is to the right people!
I've added to the above routine a check for blocksize 16384 for FreeBSD
4.5 and 5DP1 as I couldn't mount my 4.5/5DP1 FreeBSD partition in Linux.
I've left the ufstype at 44bsd.
Attached pre and post routines for 2.2.19 and 2.4.18, plus diffs (I hope
the diffs are OK).
The routines have been checked, but not exhaustively. They seem to do
what I intended - i.e. I can now mount the partitions and read and write
files and directories.
