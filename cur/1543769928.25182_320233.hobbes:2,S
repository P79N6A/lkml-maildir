Still, the compiler should be able to eliminate that extra register
as well as it can eliminate the intermediate (pte - 1) result (that
is to say, I hope perfectly in this day and age).
It may be more of an issue with architectures that actually *do* do
something in pte_unmap, in which case perhaps you increase the
register pressure over the critical loop? I guess we can just laugh
at them.

Looks like no architecture (other than maybe frv?) even uses the
kvaddr argument to kunmap_atomic unless HIGHMEM_DEBUG/DEBUG_HIGHMEM
is enabled. If you stored that info elsewhere, you wouldn't even
need to pass the argument in.
But hmm... I don't see anyone getting motivated enough to rewrite the
debug code over this issue :)
