More first impressions of sd-0.44 vs CFS-v4
CFS-v4 is quite smooth in terms of the users experience but after prolonged 
observations approaching 24 hours, it appears to choke the cpu hog off a bit 
even when the system has nothing else to do.  My amanda runs went from 1 to 
1.5 hours depending on how much time it took gzip to handle the amount of 
data tar handed it, up to about 165m & change, or nearly 3 hours pretty 
consistently over 5 runs.
sd-0.44 so far seems to be handling the same load (theres a backup running 
right now) fairly well also, and possibly theres a bit more snap to the 
system now.  A switch to screen 1 from this screen 8, and the loading of that 
screen image, which is the Cassini shot of saturn from the backside, the one 
showing that teeny dot to the left of Saturn that is actually us, took 10 
seconds with the stock 2.6.21-rc7, 3 seconds with the best of Ingo's patches, 
and now with Con's latest, is 1 second flat. Another screen however is 4 
seconds, so maybe that first scren had been looked at since I rebooted. 
However, amanda is still getting estimates so gzip hasn't put a tiewrap 
around the kernels neck just yet.
Some minutes later, gzip is smunching /usr/src, and the machine doesn't even 
know its running as sd-0.44 isn't giving gzip more than 75% to gzip, and 
probably averaging less than 50%. And it scared me a bit as it started out at 
not over 5% for the first minute or so.  Running in the 70's now according to 
gkrellm, with an occasional blip to 95%.  And the machine generally feels 
good.
I had previously given CFS-v4 a 95 score but that was before I saw the general 
slowdown, and I believe my first impression of this one is also a 95.  This 
on a scale of the best one of the earlier CFS patches being 100, and stock 
2.6.21-rc7 gets a 0.0.  This scheduler seems to be giving gzip ever more cpu 
as time progresses, and the cpu is warming up quite nicely, from about 132F 
idling to 149.9F now.  And my keyboard is still alive and well.
Generally speaking, Con, I believe this one is also a keeper.  And we'll see 
how long a backup run takes.
