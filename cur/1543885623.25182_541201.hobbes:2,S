XFS always has speculative preallocation turned on - this is
different to explicit preallocation which we are talking about
here ;)
FWIW, the reason you need your homebrew patch is that specualtive
allocation does not set the PREALLOC bit on the inode, and so when
you close the file the speculative prealloc gets truncated away.
If you use a real preallocation (XFS_IOC_RESVSP64) or the upcoming
fallocate() syscall, XFS also sets the PREALLOC bit in the inode so
it doesn't get truncated away on file close.
If you don't want to use XFS_IOC_RESVSP64, you could just use
XFS_IOC_FSSETXATTR to set the prealloc bit on the files you care
about so you don't need a hack in XFS to prevent truncation of
speculative allocation on file close.....
Cheers,
Dave.
