I assume that you have enabled the SCO support of the HCI USB driver.
The unlink of ISOC URB's fails on UHCI host controllers and actually I
don't know why. So disable the SCO support of the HCI USB driver and you
can switch on and off your Bluetooth device as often as you like.
What is your USB host controller chipset? Do you see an oops?

This was a bug in the RFCOMM layer that has been already fixed. Why
don't you say what 2.6 kernel do you use? Try the latest 2.6.2-rc2 or
2.6.1-mh3 and this will go away.
