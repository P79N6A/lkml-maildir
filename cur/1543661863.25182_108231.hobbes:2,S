We use JFFS2 for configuration parameters etc, cramfs for 
binaries etc  and tmpfs for temporary data (our embedded 
devices typically have 4 MB flash and 16 MB RAM).

Subject: File systems in embedded devices
Dear All,
We are developing a embedded device based on linux. Through the 
development phase we used NFS. But now we want to move some 
filesystem
which can be created in FLASH/RAM.
I have few doubts about the file system in embedded devices.
1) What is the file system which is used normally in all embedded 
devices? (JFFS/CRAMFS/RAM DISK)
2) We tried using RAM disk as the file system. But since our 
application is huge it is not able to fit into 8 MB RAM disk 
created. When we tried to increase the size of the RAM disk, the 
kernel crashes above 9 MB. We have 32 MB in our target board.
3) I dont know whether we can use cramfs.
Can anybody suggest me some ideas so that i can solve these 
issues?
Thanks and Regards,
Nanda
