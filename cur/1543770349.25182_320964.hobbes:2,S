Yehaaa, I got it...
There was a bug in your last patch.
This:
+	snd_ac97_update_bits(ac97, AC97_AD_SERIAL_CFG, 9 << 11,
+			     is_shared_micin(ac97) ? 0 : 9 << 11);
should be
+	snd_ac97_update_bits(ac97, AC97_AD_SERIAL_CFG, 1 << 9,
+			     is_shared_micin(ac97) ? 0 : 1 << 9);
Whit this, I can control the output just with the 2/4/6 ch mode, and get rid
of the 'Center as mic' flag...
btw, why the hell don't you use something as stupid as 
#define bit(n) (1<<(n))
???
A side note. In the process of solving all this, I tried to generate a patch
for 1.0.9rc4a against -mm. I noticed some things:
- Your code reverts some in-kernel changes related to
    if (ptr)
        kfree(ptr)
  The if is killed in mainline, as kfree accepts null pointers.
- When linking I got:
if [ -r System.map -a -x /sbin/depmod ]; then /sbin/depmod -ae -F System.map
2.6.11-jam20; fi

I think all this have been unexported/killed...
Hope this helps.
