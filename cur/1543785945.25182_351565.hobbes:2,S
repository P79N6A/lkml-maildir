Honestly, this is one of the things I like about Linux.  If I have 
memory errors, Windows will just keep running, occasionally something 
will crash, you restart it, never suspecting just how corrupt things are 
getting under the hood.  On Linux, I generally get kernel panics pretty 
quickly, so I run memtest86 and replace the RAM.
If my hardware is flaky, I consider it my job to replace it, not the job 
of all my software to magically compensate for it.  If I lose data, oh 
well, I have backups.  If I didn't, I was asking for trouble anyway.
