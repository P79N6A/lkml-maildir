I've found that black letters on a white background allow the
white surround to flow together...  (non-linear horizontal blurring --
not sure if that's perceptual non-linearity or the phosphor itself).
White letters on a black background as similar.  In both cases the
vertical parts of characters virtually disappear.
The solution for me is to use a bold font on CRTs, but grey instead of
white (on black).  So the intensity is similar, but the lines are quite
solid.  On LCDs I stick to a non-bold font.
Curiously, I still find Netscape quite readable.  I wouldn't like to
*write* with it though.  Ghostscript is not great, but better with
anti-aliasing.  Ghostscript in light on dark would look terrible, and
light on dark web pages usually look terrible too.
I wonder if my comfort zone is to have a *variety* of styles on the
screen, for different tasks.  Including some light on dark, and some
dark on light, and a variety of fonts just to keep the eyes on their
toes, as it were.
