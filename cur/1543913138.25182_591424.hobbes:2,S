I haven't used any CK804 with an HPET which is BIOS enabled by default, so 
it's probably most likely that the reference BIOS didn't enable it.
As this technology is quite antiquated, the usual "well Vista uses HPET, so 
maybe vendors will enable it" probably won't apply. I know for my board, no 
BIOS has been released since early 2006.

I don't disagree with you and I think you're right in the general case, but 
even if we could pin somebody down from NVIDIA (which is seeming unlikely, 
considering the right people have already been CCed), it would still be a 
BIOS override.
In this case,  there's a perfectly good HPET masked behind what I can only 
speculate is a BIOS misfeature (my kernel's behaved itself with Mikko's patch 
applied and Thomas's HRT patchset on x86-64).
What about an expert option which could force the HPET on (rather than "find" 
and enable it)? Are you opposed to this too?
