Yep, already tried the obvious ;)  no difference :(
2.4.33.5 onwards also have a problem with symlinks, but it is slightly 
different presentation, the directory symlinks appear as normal files.
With 2.4.33.7 one is able to create file and directory symlinks, though 
the links appear as files.  Content problem as noted by OP:
grant@sempro:/home/other$ uname -r
2.4.33.7
grant@sempro:/home/other$ cat file
this is a test
grant@sempro:/home/other$ cat filelink
thisgrant@sempro:/home/other$
grant@sempro:/home/other$ mkdir directory
grant@sempro:/home/other$ ln -s directory directorylink
grant@sempro:/home/other$ cp file* directory
grant@sempro:/home/other$ ls directory
file*  filelink*
grant@sempro:/home/other$ ls directorylink
directorylink*
Now, WinXP sees the contents of directorylink:
X:\>cd directorylink
X:\directorylink>dir
 Volume in drive X is other
 Volume Serial Number is 107E-052F
 Directory of X:\directorylink
2007-01-18  16:36    <DIR>          .
2007-01-18  16:33    <DIR>          ..
2007-01-18  16:36                15 file
2007-01-18  16:36                 4 filelink
               2 File(s)             19 bytes
               2 Dir(s)   2,558,922,752 bytes free
X:\directorylink>type file
this is a test
X:\directorylink>type filelink
this
X:\directorylink>
