I'm more amazed how long Ingo can resist providing some explanations (not 
just about this problem).
It's not like I haven't given him anything, he already has the test 
programs, he already knows the system configuration.
Well, I've sent him the stuff now...

Fixing the bug requires some knowledge what the code is intended to do.

Could you please ask Ingo the same? I'm simply trying to get some 
transparancy into the CFS design. Without further information it's 
difficult to tell, whether something is supposed to work this way or it's 
a bug.
In this case it's quite possible that due to a recent change my testcase 
doesn't work anymore. Should I consider the problem fixed or did it just 
go into hiding? Without more information it's difficult to verify this 
independently.
bye, Roman
