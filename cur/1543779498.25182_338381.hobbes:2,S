With this applied, the system boots then X locks up in memcpy as before.
The cmpxchg_fail_flag_update remains at zero but given the above patch,
that's to be expected...
Sadly, remote access to the system isn't really much use as there is no
compiler on the device and flashing a new kernel is a manual procedure
involving pressing buttons.
