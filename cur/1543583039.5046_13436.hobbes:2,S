	Yop,
	Just a newbie question ...
	Why sys_sched_yield don't call schedule ?
	man page of sched_yield tell : 
	"A  process  can relinquish the processor voluntarily 
	without blocking by calling sched_yield.  
	The process will then be moved to the end 
	of the queue for its static priority and 
	a new process gets to run."
	Bye.
