FYI,
I have just tried mm5. I have Gnome2 working (using kdm) but am still
having the same problems as mm3:
1) gnome-terminal still only works as root.
2) xosview still freezes (reading /proc/*)
3) rmmod still not working -"Can't open 'analog': No such file or
directory"
4) su - <user> returns "operation not permitted". Works as root though
and thereafter as <user>.
5) This is the second time this has happened after switching to 2.5.x;
My Evolution groups (left-hand icon bar) have gone missing.
6) from /var/log/messages: /sbin/mingetty[2583]: /dev/tty4: cannot open
tty: Inappropriate ioctl for device
7) Excessive "anticipatory scheduling elevator" messages allover in
/var/log/messages.
8) from dmesg: process `named' is using obsolete setsockopt SO_BSDCOMPAT
I think there is something "not quite right" in the terminal I/O area.
Ed-T.
