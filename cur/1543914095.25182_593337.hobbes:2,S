Yeah, but then you would make immediate.o an obj-y (both for
kernel/Makefile and arch/*/kernel/Makefile) and it would be built
even on systems that would be configured not to use immediate values.
Therefore, it would compile-in unused code if we do as you propose,
which I am reluctant to do on embedded systems where code size matters.
