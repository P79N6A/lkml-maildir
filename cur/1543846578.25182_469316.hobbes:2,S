http://tservice.net.ru/~s0mbre/archive/kevent/evserver_kevent.c

Structures were not changed from the beginning of kevent project.

mmap interface itself is in question, since it allows to create dos
since there are no rlimits for pinned memory.

AIO was removed from patchset by request of Cristoph.
Timers, network AIO, fs AIO, socket nortifications and poll/select
events work well with existing structures.

Signals and userspace events (hello solaris) easily fits into existing
structures.
It is even possible to create variable sized kevents - each kevent
contain pointer to user's data, which can be considered as pointer to
additional area (it's size kernel implementation for given kevent type
can determine from other parameters or use predefined one and fetch
additional data in ->enqueue() callback).
