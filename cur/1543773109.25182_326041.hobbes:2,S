I believe syslog can handle this just fine. Just add some gui code to
watch syslog, and if high-enough (KERN_CRIT?) message happens, display
that message to user.
...which brings interesting question of "how to internationalize this
beast", but list of KERN_CRIT messages should be reasonably small.
