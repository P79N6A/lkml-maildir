I read this as "get saner processor".
But frankly any CPU optimization manuals, not just Intel's,
go to semi-absurd suggestions like "align all data
and branch targets to $BIGNUM bytes", "do not use instruction X
(because we failed to make it work reasonably fast), use Y".
Of course next gen CPU will prefer Y over X
(for example, AMD's recomended way to do NOPs).
