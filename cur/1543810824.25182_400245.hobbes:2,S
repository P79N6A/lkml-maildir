Dear Arjan van de Ven,
The following contex is coming from comment of Christoph Hellwig.
- msi should be a module options if at all, but defintitly not
   a config options
#ifdef CONFIG_SCSI_ARCMSR_MSI
 if (!pci_enable_msi(pci_device))
  pACB->acb_flags |= ACB_F_HAVE_MSI;
#endif
I make an option config for prevent some mainboards hang up if arcmsr enable 
msi function.
Areca RAID controller is bridged hardware.
There were a lots of mainboards had wrong IRQ routing table issue with it.
If somebody meet this issue and people can enable msi function to fix its 
hardware bug.
But unfortunately I found some mainboards will hang up if I always enable 
this function in my lab.
To avoid this issue, I do an option for this case.
But  Christoph Hellwig give me comment with it.
Best Regards
Erich Chen
