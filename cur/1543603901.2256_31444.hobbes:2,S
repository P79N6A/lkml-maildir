Actually I am trying to recast your requirement (for fairness) into
something that is clean and easy to code :)  Keeping track of the number
of tasks a cpu executes over a given period of time, while possible,
does not seem to me to give a very good indication of its load.

I don't dispute balance, I am just trying to suggest a way to do it that
IMHO is relatively easy.

In practice, in a given time (say a "recalculate period") a given cpu
with a given set of tasks will end up doing a fixed amount of work
(provided we don't allow idle tasks).  This could be stated as a sum of
time slices or CPU jiffies if you like.  As long as loads are passed
from cpu to cpu to make them all end a "recalculate period" at the same
time, I would contend we have balance.  Counting tasks is problematic as
tasks come and go and present varying loads.  The real trick is in
figuring which task to move, or if none should be moved.

The current schedule periodically calculates new time slices for each
task.  It does this when no task in the run queue has any slice time
left.  The slice size each task gets is related to the NICE value.  In
practice then (other things being equal) each task will get a portion of
the available processing time that is related to its NICE value.  I
think this is fair.  But, of course, other things are not equal.  When a
task is blocked and the recalculation happens, that task gets to keep
1/2 of it remaining slice as well as the new slice.  Since, in addition
to slice time, the remaining slice value is used as a major component of
the task's priority, this means that the blocked task, if it is blocked
during a recalculate, will get a boosted priority.
I think what Alan is suggesting is that the priority boost is needed for
blocked tasks, but not necessarily the increased slice time.

But doesn't the f(NICE) used as a slice do this.  The point is that we
will not allow a recalculate until all run able tasks with non zero
slice times have run their slice times to zero.  This insures that all
tasks that can use the cpu will get their fair share of time each
"recalculate period".
This is pretty much what is done today across the whole run queue.  The
enhancement we are talking about is separating tasks by cpu and pretty
much keeping them on one cpu.
