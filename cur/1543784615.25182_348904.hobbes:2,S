I applied and tested it with 2.6.13 vanilla kernel + linux.patch as suggested, but so far no problem as with 2.6.13-mm2.
I also played with the git-snapshots 2.6.13-git[1-9] no problem here. I think the problem is
somewhere else we have to pay attention, too. MD Raidlevels [0,1] failed to start with 2.6.13-mm2.
Raid0 config:
2x 20GB Partitiontype 0xFD "Linux Raid autodetect"
64k Chunksize, persistent superblock.
little output from mdadm

I have no idea where I should look, to resolve this behavior.

As for all the time, I'm willing to test to glue the problem out.
Thanks
