Whoops. I should have been more explicit: This only affects people who 
are running linux-2.2.1 with my write gathering patch or Alan Cox's
patch-2.2.1-ac3 or greater, and who insist on killing the rpciod
daemon before they're finished working.
  Stock linux-2.2.1 works perfectly OK with nfsroot and RedHat to my
knowledge.
Cheers,
  Trond
