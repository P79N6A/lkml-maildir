So on every inode hook call, you end up allocating a temporary page,
calling d_path (taking global dcache_lock), and you do this possibly
multiple times per object (due to iterating over vfsmounts) and you may
need to do it for multiple objects on a single hook call (e.g.
link/rename).   Is that correct?

So what about the !nd case.  For when permission(9) is called with a
NULL nameidata.  Unconditional success in that case seems a bit
worrisome.
I also vaguely recall a problem with trying to use the nameidata
(vfsmount, dentry) pair to d_path in SELinux for audit purposes back
when avc_audit was trying to audit paths before migrating to using the
audit system for that purpose.  Interacted badly with rpc_pipefs upon
rpc_lookup_parent, IIRC.  Might want to check whether you handle it
correctly.
