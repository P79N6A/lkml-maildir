   Please note that these `routines' are actually simple macros or inline
functions on most architectures, hence your argument doesn't apply.

   I've added a reference to IO-mapping.txt to pci.txt.

   Well, probably a better attitude towards Linux is to contribute some
documentation yourself :)

   Please send me names of all such drivers, I'll fix them :)
