Well, I have it working now.  The real problem is an arp cacheing 
problem I believe.  It works exactly as expected when I give that 
device the same MAC address in the machines bios settings as the 
D-Link card had.  And I don't know howto force arp to refresh its 
cache before it times out, which it didn't do in something like 14 
hours.  It would have been something I would have had to do on a 
RH7.3 box, which has so far been dead stable with over a 70 day 
uptime now.  For all I know, maybe a reboot would have fixed it as I 
have NDI where this 'arp cache' is located, and if in memory only, a 
powerdown would have forced a refresh.  I can think of a lot of "what 
if's" :-)
Nvidia is immune to bad press, and probably cannot release a thing 
other than some API help due to copyright contracts with the coders 
who wrote their winderz drivers for them,  The only cure would be for 
them to hired a couple of dozen programmers of the minimum quality 
the open source programmers exhibit, which I happen to think is top 
notch, and the CEO can only see outgo without compensatory income for 
all that salary, so they contract it out for a known cost, and get 
tied up in restrictive contracts.
Fscking copyright problems will be the end of any resemblance of 
civilization before the Warren Hatches have fallen by the wayside.  
Its happening right before our eyes.
