        CONFIG_COMX is the only driver that I have to disable in
order for the linux-2.3.99pre3 kernel to compile (at least our
version of it).  At first, I thought that the compile errors were
the result of comx.c not being ported to some recent simplifications
in the procfs interface.  However, on closer inspection, I see that
there are problems like references to an internal variable that is
never defined (e.g., proc_dir_inode_operations).  This suggests to
me that perhaps the problem is actually the result of an incompletely
applied patch, since it looks like the current version could not
compile under any version of the procfs interface.
