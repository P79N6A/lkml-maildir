How about putting the ability to disable graphics mode in the kernel and 
moving this capability from X, and saving the video state. Would make 
kernel debuggers work a hell of a lot better when the damn thing crashes 
in X in the kernel. At least then the screen won;t be locked up (of 
course you can type "reboot " from memory while the system is still hung 
in X).
