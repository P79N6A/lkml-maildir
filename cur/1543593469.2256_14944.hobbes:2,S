[ please CC replies to me ]
Perusing the kernel sources while investigating watchdog drivers, I
notice that in some places, Fahrenheit is used, and in some places,
Celsius.  It would seem logical to me to have a global config option,
so that you *know* that you talk devices either in F or C.
I searched the archives for discussions regarding this, but didn't
find anything, apologies if I missed something.
