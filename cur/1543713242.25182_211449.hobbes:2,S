I agree in principle, but it would still be nice to have a simple way to 
have useful capabilities without setting up a MAC system.  I don't see a 
capabilities fix adding any significant amount of code; it just takes 
some effort to get it right.

I'm not sure that introduces security problems, but I'm also not sure it 
fixes much.  You can find my attempts to get it right in the 
linux-kernel archives, and I'll probably try to get something into 2.7 
when it forks.  With or without MAC, having a functioning capability 
system wouldn't hurt security.
