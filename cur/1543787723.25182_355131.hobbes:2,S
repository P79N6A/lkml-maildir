When I sent a patch with no "from" line, and two "Signed-off-by"
lines (the patch that prompted this excursion into documentation
excellence) Linus stated that the patch author ended up coming from
the second "Signed-off-by" line.
Perhaps it "should" be the first (actually - I tend to agree),
but it seems that it "is" the last.
