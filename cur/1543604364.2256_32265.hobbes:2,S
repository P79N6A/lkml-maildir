Erm, when did they break?  Paul sent in (and I swear I saw 'em accepted)
patches to -ac6 or 7.  This is just updating to the stuff in 2.4.11
which will make it's way to Alan shortly (esp if the next ext3 is vs
-ac10).
In fact, I see some regressions even:
linux/arch/ppc/kernel/setup.c really should be bogus (and I hope this
isn't in Linus tree...)
linux/drivers/char/serial.c should _never_ make it out of the ppc tree
as it's a hack that can die shortly.  And ncr885 is dead.
Alan, please don't apply this.
