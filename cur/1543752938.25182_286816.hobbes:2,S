Having disabled ALL mouse functionality (including 'mousedev'), I 
compiled 2.6.9-rc2-bk2.  On bootup, keyboard input worked great.
So many it's a conflict with the mouse driver then.
BTW, I haven an MSI NEO K8T FIS2R motherboard with an athlon64/3200+,
for what it's worth.
I will follow up with logs shortly.
