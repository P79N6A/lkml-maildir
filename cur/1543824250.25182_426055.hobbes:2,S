Hi,
there are many differences between the files in
arch/{i386,x86_64}/boot, but it seems most (if not all) of them
have no effect on the generated code and are purely cosmetical.
I have a patch which increases similarity between these
subtrees, while still generating identical code. After that,
only very few differences remain in
compressed/misc.c
video.S
tools/build.c
and it should be possible to unify them and kill one copy of
each.
Would a series of incremental patches to consolidate these two
subtrees get accepted?
Regards,
Carl-Daniel
