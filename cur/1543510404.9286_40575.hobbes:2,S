Maybe if it gets cleared incorrectly and the tx_interrupt later uses
"if(test_and_clear_bit(0,dev-tbusy)) mark_bh(NET_BH);" then no other
packets get passed until somebody else (e.g. the next incoming icmp echo
reply, QUESTION: will another outgoing ping socket also kick net_bh?)
marks NET_BH. If the error persisted for subsequent packets,
this might explain the "with two simultaneous pings, the sum of the delays
is the delay of a single ping" phenomenon because two simultaneous
pings will mark net_bh twice as frequently.
If tbusy remained set incorrectly, then net_bh will call dev->hard_start_xmit
once a second for allowing the device to perform tx_timeout recovery.
With such an error, two simultaneous pings should not result in increased
throughput.

Well, if hard_start_xmit gets called, realizes that transmitter is
busy, returns with tbusy set, and a tx_interrupt clears tbusy in
between, tbusy might remain incorrectly set. (But I donŽt see how this
could cause persistent delays because the device should recover after the
next tx_timeout).
What happens if tbusy is not set from dev->hard_start_xmit() but
from some other xmit pass that bypasses hard_start_xmit?
(maybe [i]pppd is such such bypass although I havnŽt found a hidden
tbusy setting yet).
