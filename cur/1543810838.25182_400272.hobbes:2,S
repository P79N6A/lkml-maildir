When Kirill Korovaev announced OpenVZ patch set on LKML (two times -- 
initially and for 2.6.15), he gave the links to the broken-out patch 
set, both times.

That reflects our internal organization: we have a core virtualization 
team which comes up with a core patch (combining all the stuff), and a 
maintenance team which can add some extra patches (driver updates, some 
bugfixes). So that extra patches comes up as a separate patches in 
src.rpms, while virtualization stuff comes up as a single patch. That 
way it is easier for our maintainters group.
Sure we understand this is not convenient for developers who want to 
look at our code -- and thus we provide broken-out kernel patch sets 
from time to time (not for every release, as it requires some effort 
from Kirill, who is really buzy anyway). So, if you want this for a 
specific kernel -- just ask.
I understand that this might look strange, but again, this reflects our 
internal development structure.

Again, yes, occasionally from time to time, or upon request.

In that version I took (025stab014) it was indeed as one big patch, and 
I believe Kirill maintains it that way.
Previous kernel version (025stab012) was more fine-grained, take a look 
at

Absolutely agree!
