Nothing, if they meet your needs.  One thing you can do with relayfs
files is mmap() them.  That combined with the kernel-side API,
designed to make writing data into buffers and transferring it as
large blocks to user-space efficient and flexible, allows for
high-speed, high-volume applications which I'm not sure Netlink was
designed for.
relayfs can also be used in 'packet' mode, using read(2) to read data
as it becomes available, so it can be used for low-speed, low-volume
applications as well.  Also, some people might find the file-based
approach more natural to deal with.  Personal preference, I suppose.
