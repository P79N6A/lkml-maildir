Performance gain is small, but measurable: 0,02%
Tested on an Atlon64 running at 1000MHz.
I took this value from 9 runs (each with/without the patch) of 
	$ time lame x.wav
where each took about 1 minute.
3000 Interrupts/s were generated at the time by running
	$ jackd -R -dalsa -p64 -n2
0,02% really isn't that much....but Athlon64 is better than P4
with branch predictions, I think.
Erm... ok, I won't insist on having this patch applied ;-)
