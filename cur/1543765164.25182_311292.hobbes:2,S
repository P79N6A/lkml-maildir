The problem is that your "out-of-tree open source driver" is an
inadequate solution. Out of tree drivers are a pain for users,
developers, and distributors. As such, we make very little allowance
for their concerns, especially when they stand in the way of improving
things that _are_ in the kernel.
The proposed patch makes the in-tree driver work for hardware that it
didn't before which is a net good for our users. The ball is now in
your court: replace it with an acceptable version of your driver in a
timely fashion. Saying you'll get around to it some day when you're
done supporting 2.4 is not timely. Nor does it serve your users.
Alternately, provide a good reason not to include said patch without
reference to might-as-well-not-exist-as-far-as-we're-concerned out of
tree drivers or the similarly irrelevant wishes of nebulous corporate
entities.
