Commit 05dc8c02bf40090e9ed23932b1980ead48eb8870 causes the following 
compile error with the mips defconfig:
<--  snip  -->
...
  CC      drivers/video/logo/logo.o
/home/bunk/linux/kernel-2.6/git/linux-2.6/drivers/video/logo/logo.c: In function 'fb_find_logo':
/home/bunk/linux/kernel-2.6/git/linux-2.6/drivers/video/logo/logo.c:91: error: 'mips_machgroup' undeclared (first use in this function)
/home/bunk/linux/kernel-2.6/git/linux-2.6/drivers/video/logo/logo.c:91: error: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
/home/bunk/linux/kernel-2.6/git/linux-2.6/drivers/video/logo/logo.c:91: error: for each function it appears in.)
/home/bunk/linux/kernel-2.6/git/linux-2.6/drivers/video/logo/logo.c:91: error: 'MACH_GROUP_SGI' undeclared (first use in this function)
make[4]: *** [drivers/video/logo/logo.o] Error 1
<--  snip  -->
It seems the drivers/net/jazzsonic.c and drivers/video/logo/logo.c parts 
that are part of the corresponding commit in the mips git tree got lost
somewhere.
