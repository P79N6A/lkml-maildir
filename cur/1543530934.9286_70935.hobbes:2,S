Which of these is /boot?  Unless it is /dev/hda10, you are still
booting from the first 8G of the drive.
I am pretty sure LILO does not use the LBA BIOS extensions, and thus
cannot read sectors beyond the first 8G of the drive.  Again, it is
possible this has been changed in recent versions of LILO, but then
"linear" would not work with older BIOSes (those which do not support
LBA extensions).
Try booting a kernel image from hda10 to find out...
