According to the 2.6.0-test3 menuconfig help text, the parameter is
required when CPU Enumeration Only is selected, and enables only
limited ACPI support.  For whatever it's worth, that matches my
experience.
   CONFIG_ACPI_HT_ONLY:
   This option enables limited ACPI support -- just enough to
   enumerate processors from the ACPI Multiple APIC Description
   Table (MADT).  Note that ACPI supports both logical (e.g. Hyper-
   Threading) and physical processors, where the MultiProcessor
   Specification (MPS) table only supports physical processors. 
   Full ACPI support (CONFIG_ACPI) is preferred.  Use this option
   only if you wish to limit ACPI's role to processor enumeration. 
   In this configuration, ACPI defaults to off. It must be enabled
   on the command-line with the "acpismp=force" option.
