/dev/ was a good hint. I found the problem:
When booting the Solaris system wants to write to the 
Boot environment (nasty, isn't it?).
Since the userspace daemon doesn't understand the /etc/exports syntax
of the kernel version, I wrote a different, simplified /etc/exports
for the userspace daemon. 
The userspace daemon allowed write access, the kernel version didn't. 
That was the problem.
