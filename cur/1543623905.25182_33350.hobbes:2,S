I think there are two bugs here that need treating in different ways.
1. Not displaying port statistics for iomem-based ports.  This is
   probably an oversight when iomem ports were added to the serial
   driver.
2. "port:" entry being 0.  I don't think we really want to report IO
   port or memory addresses here without giving userspace some
   indication which we're reporting.
For 2, I'd suggest replacing "port:" with "mem:" for iomem ports, and
changing the serinfo: line to reflect the changed format (this is
probably ignored by kudzu though.)
Does this sound reasonable?
