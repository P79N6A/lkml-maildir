Subject: [CFT][PATCH] namespaces patch (2.4.5-pre6)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

	Folks, new version of the patch is on
ftp.math.psu.edu/pub/viro/namespaces-c-S5-pre6.gz
	News:
* ported to 2.4.5-pre6
* new (cleaner) locking mechanism
* lock_super() is starting to become fs-private thing - first steps to
  removing it from VFS code are done.
Please, help with testing. I'm feeding the pieces suitable for 2.4 into
the Linus' tree, so patch got smaller.
It works here(tm). It had survived rather sadistic tortu^Wtesting, but I
am _very_ interested in more eyes going through the thing and more people
giving it a beating.
