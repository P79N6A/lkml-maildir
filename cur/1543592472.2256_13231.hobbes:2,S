It won't, the open for "." is handled in the VFS, not the filesystem - 
it will open the directory.  (Without needing to be told it's a 
directory via O_DIRECTORY.)  If you do open("magicdev") you'll get the 
device, because that's handled by magicdevfs.
I'm not claiming there isn't breakage somewhere, just that we didn't 
find it on this attempt.
