Let me clarify that this was something we briefly touched on in
Walldorf: The node manager would (re-)export the current data via sysfs
(which would result in uevents being sent, too), and not something we
dreamed up just Monday ;-)

Well, node manager still can provide you the input as to which nodes are
configured, which in a way translates to "membership". The thing it
doesn't seem to provide yet is the supsend/modify/resume cycle which for
example the RHAT DLM seems to require.
