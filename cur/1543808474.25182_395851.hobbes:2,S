You'll want libata (but not eventually all of the scsi layer) for just
about anything at that point. On the bright side you won't have scsi
loaded for your USB devices and drivers/ide loaded for your IDE disks so
for most cases I suspect it will be neutral or save memory.
If you are really tighht on memory and just using CF then its probably
worth writing a simple CF driver for embedded use. Its probably a matter
of 10K of code if that for the subset in question.
