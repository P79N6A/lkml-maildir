Not if you want it *dead*, *now*, with a core dump, and with minimal disruption
of program state.  Sometimes (especially when trying to shoot a race condition)
you just can't run the program under gdb - and if it calls _exit() there's not much
wreckage left for gdb to look at....

Well, I can *see* the fact it exited with a signal in 'lastcomm' already.  If that's all
the info you're providing, it's of no help.
Now, if you figure out how to read the module's -g data and give me a line number
it died at:
	kprint(DEBUG "Process %d (%s) died on  signal %d at line %d of function %s", ....
but that would involve a lot of file I/O from kernelspace, soo.....
