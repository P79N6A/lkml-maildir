Unlikely to deadlock for normal filesystems, but swap on encrypted loop is a
different case.
Deadlock free operation is exactly why my prealloc loop patch is needed.
Beyond initial preallocating that is done at losetup time, it does not
allocate anything from kernel memory pools, but effectively recycles its
private per loop device preallocated memory. Encrypted swap needs that, and
normal device backed loop file systems are also happy with deadlock free and
VM stress free operation.
