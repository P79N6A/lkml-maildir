Please remember that, in almost all cases, any use of page->flags can be
replaced by a simple list.  Is a page marked foo?  Well, just traverse
this data structure and see if the page is in there.  It might be a
stinking slow check, but it will *work*.
I think we're up to using 1 bit in the memory hotplug code, but we don't
even need that if some operations can be implemented more slowly.  
An extreme example:
struct list_head foo;
int PageSuspendFoo(page)
{
	ret = 0;
	lock();
	list_for_each(foo, bar) {
		if (page == bar)
			ret = 1;
	}
	unlock();
	return ret;
}
