Richard,
	You might give mgetty a try.  I've been doing the same thing as
you with almost every version of Linux 2.4.x and some of 2.2.x.  I don't
know the differences between agetty and mgetty, but I would like mgetty
could handle your needs.
Steve

I'm now using 2.4.20. The previous version was 2.2.18 (yikes)!
I just transferred my old hard disks (SCSI) to a new system and
everything worked fine, so I decided to upgrade to a later more
stable kernel. I use this system to be my own internet provider
and I am, in fact, logged in running a ppp link from home over
the modem at this time. I had to modify `agetty` to make it
work with the new kernel and a faster CPU (1.2 GHz, 330 MHz
front-side bus, Tyan Thunder-II).
The agetty code is attached. It hangs up before it sleeps for
a new connection because when the previous process terminates,
init instantly starts a new instance, the modem never hangs up
even though, possibly the DTR was lowered for that instant.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
