Subject: [PATCH] move PREEMPT_RCU config option back under PREEMPT
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Hello!
The original preemptible-RCU patch put the choice between classic and
preemptible RCU into kernel/Kconfig.preempt, which resulted in build
failures on machines not supporting CONFIG_PREEMPT.  This choice was
therefore moved to init/Kconfig, which worked, but placed the choice
between classic and preemptible RCU at the top level, a very obtuse choice
indeed.  This patch changes from the Kconfig "choice" mechanism to a pair
of booleans, only one of which (CONFIG_PREEMPT_RCU) is user-visible,
and is located in kernel/Kconfig.preempt, where one would expect it
to be.  The other (CONFIG_CLASSIC_RCU) is in init/Kconfig so that it
is available to all architectures, hopefully avoiding build breakage.
Thanks to Roman Zippel for suggesting this approach.
I have tested this, but sadly do not have access to a machine that does
not support CONFIG_PREEMPT.  However, I did edit my config in an attempt
to simulate this situation.
