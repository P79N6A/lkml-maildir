Hello,
Beginning from kernel v2.1.129 "insmod shaper.o" giving
the following error:
        shaper.o: unresolved symbol arp_broken_ops
Today I have tried kernel 2.1.132 with the same result.
So, last kernel version with working shaper is 2.1.128.
Can anyone restore the shaper in kernel?
With best regards,
Alexander Feldman
