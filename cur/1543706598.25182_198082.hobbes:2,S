IMHO it's the opposite. Transfer speed * seek time of some
slow devices is lower than fast devices. For example:
Hard disk  raw speed= 40MB/s   seek time =  8ms
MO/ZIP     raw speed=  3MB/s   seek time = 25ms
One seek of HD costs about 320KB, while on a slow drive it's
only 75KB. 2.4 has a terrible latency on slow devices, and it
has very small advantage in terms of speed. On CDs and DVDs
the cost of a seek is much higher, but since the data is
usually accessed sequentially you have the high latency
penalty with no appreciable speed gain in this case too.
