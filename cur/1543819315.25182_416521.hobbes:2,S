I'm currently working on port multiplier support.  My working tree now
successfully probes and attaches all devices over the PM and I'm
currently trying to get EH and hotplug to work with it nicely.
EH/hotplug are being changed to support PM.  Effects on LLDDs are
minimal but you can probably save some work by waiting for the next
round of patches before porting to new EH.
I think/hope this can be finished in this week and bombard Jeff with
patches (updated EH, NCQ, hotplug and PM) before the weekend, so that
Jeff can have some time to review and hopefully merge some of it into
#upstream before he goes off on honeymoon.  In some convoluted way,
the patches will be my marriage gift, heh heh.
Jeff, *BIG* congratulations.  I wish you a great marriage.
Thanks.
