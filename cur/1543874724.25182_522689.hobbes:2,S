a dm layer that detects and remaps soft errors before they become hard errors is 
useful for hard drives as well.

both of these also sound useful as dm layers (in fact lvm already does some of 
the resizing things)

wear leveling would also be useful on other block devices (think CD-RAM for 
example)
cross-device wear leveling sounds a lot like putting the wear leveling layer 
above a lvm-like layer that stitches the seperate flash chips togeather into one 
logical device.
additionally, if wear leveling is an optional layer in dm then it can be left 
out when it's not appropriate (like when the FS has features that make it 
unnessasary, or when it's read-only so you don't have writes to worry about (or 
even if it's read-only 99.9999% of the time so writes are so rare that all the 
writes in the expected lifetime of the device won't cause problems)
