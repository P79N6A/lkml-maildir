If your subscribing and reading this list at least have the courtesy to 
think about your posting before delivering it around the world.  Not to 
be rude but do you know how dumb you look right now.  There are many

be a first step.

*WTF*!!  For someone that's been lurking on the kernel lists on and off 
since the mid 90's this has been one of the most stupid discussions and 
largest timesink to date..  Is this really the LKML or the #linux 
channel on irc?
