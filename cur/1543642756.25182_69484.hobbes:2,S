Thats a very very strange machine 8). Your diagnosis is correct. We are
assuming conventional PC north bridge behaviour. I take it this is your
blade systems. 
As far as I can make out from the ALi docs you can't get an ALi north
bridge at anywhere but 0:0.0 in which case making the check
       if(north && north->vendor == ...)
should do the trick.
