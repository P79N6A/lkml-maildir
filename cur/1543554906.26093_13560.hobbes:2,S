The crypto-api from the international kernel patch has recently defined
that the encryption functions contained in it must be able to encrypt
in-place. This maps directly to the loop-gen driver, so I don't see a
problem here. (Other than that there is no real patch-int-2.4.x out
there yet). However, the ciphers have not been checked to conform to
that definition.
