Subject: more efficient current_is_keventd macro? [was Re: [lhcs-devel] Re: Kthread_create() never returns when called from worker_thread]

Hi Ingo,
	current_is_keventd() macro checks "current" with the per-cpu
thread of _all_ possible cpus attached to keventd_wq. Can't it just check 
against the per-cpu thread of _current_ cpu alone (since the per-cpu workqueue
threads are anyway bound only to their cpus)?  
int current_is_keventd(void)
{
        struct cpu_workqueue_struct *cwq;
-       int cpu;
+       int cpu = smp_processor_id();
        BUG_ON(!keventd_wq);
-       for_each_cpu(cpu) {
-               cwq = keventd_wq->cpu_wq + cpu;
-               if (current == cwq->thread)
-                       return 1;
-       }
-       return 0;
+	cwq = keventd_wq->cpu_wq + cpu;
+	if (current == cwq->thread)
+		return 1;
+	else
+		return 0;
}

You'd think so, but it's not my code.  I believe you are correct though.
Cheers,
Rusty.
