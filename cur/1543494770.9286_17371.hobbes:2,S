You have your test wrong. If the compiler *DOES* show the string, then it is
buggy. By DEFINITION, in C, 0 is FALSE, and the value of an assignment is
the value assigned to the variable.
  if (i = foo())
is a common construct, equivalent to
  if ((i = foo()) != 0)
You can discuss all you want whether the construct is ugly or misleading,
but this is not "taking advantage of a gcc bug", it is taking advantage of a
C design feature.

The problem is that if anybody writes code like this, they should be
terminated with extreme prejudice. This is using a gcc compiler bug as
a feature.
#include <stdio.h>
int foo()
{
    return 0;
}
int main()
{
 int i;
 if(i=foo())
     (void)puts("If this is not seen, it is a compiler BUG!");
 return 0;
}
LCLint 2.2a --- 04 Sep 96
xxx.c: (in function main)
xxx.c:13,5: Test expression for if is assignment expression: i = foo()
  The condition test is an assignment expression. Probably, you mean to use
==
  instead of =. If an assignment is intended, add an extra parentheses
nesting
  (e.g., if ((a = b)) ...) to suppress this message. (-predassign will
suppress
  message)
xxx.c:13,5: Test expression for if not bool, type int: i = foo()
  Test expression type is not boolean or int. (-predboolint will suppress
  message)
Finished LCLint checking --- 2 code errors found
gcc 'fixes' obvious coding errors like this. If a compiler fixes
these errors, it should fix the source while it's at it so I don't
have to see them again.
