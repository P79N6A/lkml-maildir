Can someone elaborate on this?  Does this mean a Xen guest can run on 
bare metal?
Is there code available to make this work (it doesn't seem contained in 
this patchset)?  Has any performance analysis been done?
The numbers that have been posted with the VMI patches suggest that some 
rather tricky stuff is required to achieve native performance when 
running a guest on bare metal.  If this is not the case, it would be 
very interesting to know because it seems to be the hairiest part of the 
VMI patches.
Otherwise, if we want to support Xen guests on bare metal, it seems we 
would have to change things in the subarch code a bit to do something 
similar to VMI.
