This doesn't apply anymore because most of <asm/hardirq.h> moved
to linux/hardirq.h in -mm and a the patch is on it's way to Linus.

Please don't introduce the generic_ names just to have every arch (in your
previous patches, that is) provide a wrapper with normal names again.

And make hardirq.o dependent on some symbols the architectures set.
Else arches that don't use it carry tons of useless baggage around (and
in fact I'm pretty sure it wouldn't even compie for many)
