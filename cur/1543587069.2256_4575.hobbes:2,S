Hi,
I am having trouble with increasing the file descriptor size for my
application - it opens several files for each client session (and needs
to keep them open as long as the session is active, which can be upto 3
hours long). What I see from the application is "open failed in
FileStreamReader::setupFile: Too many open files".
I have bumped up /proc/sys/fs/file-max to 16K, but I am failing at  2638
(cat /proc/sys/fs/file-max returns "2638 97 16384") when the number of
files my app opened reached 1023.
There is a comment in /usr/include/linux/posix_types.h regarding
__FD_SETSIZE being set to 1024. How can I increase this value?
Thanks,
Ram Madduluri
