I seem to remember seeing some patches go by at some point that allowed 
one of the rom type embeded system filesystems to directly execute 
binaries out of the original rom memory rather than copying them to ram 
first, then executing from there.  I was wondering if rootfs or tmpfs 
support such execute in place today, or if binaries executed from there 
have their code segments duplicated in ram?
