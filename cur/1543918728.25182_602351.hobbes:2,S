This seems to be similar to the problem Ingo reported
(
http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=119125007102969
). We have sent a fix
for it subsequently (
http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=119143193812026
).
Can you resync to Ingo's latest cfs-devel tree (which will remove the
bad patch you have), then apply the patch at
http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=119143193812026
 and verify if the
problem goes away?
