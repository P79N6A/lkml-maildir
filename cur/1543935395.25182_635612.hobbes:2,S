Temporary amnesia? :-) I'll change that, atomic_dec_and_test will be
clearer.

This is the part I've been struggling with the most -- defining what
proper behavior should be when lockd is restarted. As you point out,
restarting lockd without doing a sm_notify could be bad news for data
integrity.
Then again, we'd like someone to be able to shut down the NFS "service"
and be able to unmount underlying filesystems without jumping through
special hoops....
Overall, I think I'd vote "yes". We need to drop locks when the last
nfsd goes down. If userspace brings down nfsd, then it's userspace's
responsibility to make sure that a sm_notify is sent when nfsd and lockd
are restarted.
As a side note, I'm not thrilled with this design that mixes signals
and kthreads, but didn't see another way to do this. I'm open to
suggestions if anyone has them...

The nlmsvc_ref logic is pretty convoluted, unfortunately. I'll plan to
add some comments to clarify what I'm doing there.
Thanks for the review, Neil. I'll see if I can get a new patchset done
in the next few days.
