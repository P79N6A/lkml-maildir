as far as i'm concerned x86 is obsolete: my main devel and testboxes are 
64-bit throughout, and i develop for 64-bit by default.
Nevertheless for hard-to-debug bugs i prefer if they can be reproduced 
and debugged on 32-bit too, because x86_64 debugging is still quite a 
PITA and wastes alot of time: for example it has no support for exact 
kernel stacktraces. Also, the printout of the backtrace is butt-ugly and 
as un-ergonomic to the human eye as it gets - who came up with that 
"two-maybe-one function entries per-line" nonsense? [Whoever did it he 
never had to look at (and make sense of) hundreds of stacktraces in a 
row.]
Also, the majority of kernel bugs still get reported on 32-bit and most 
of the testers are on 32-bit. So x86_64 is nice but it still needs some 
work, mainly in terms of debuggability.
