Works for me.  I have the premption patch turned on.
On a 192 MB PIII laptop running at 500 MHz I have two X sessions
running, and have opened a zillion application windows on each,
including over a dozen Netscape windows, some Mozilla's, a couple
emacs's, a kernel compile, Staroffice.  About every app I can
immediately think of.  I haven't tried malloc-ing a ton of memory, but
this contrived real-world test works.
Swap is at 238 MB.  Lower than I would have expected, but that doesn't
mean I know anything.
Switching between X sessions just took near 10-seconds going, and only
about 5-seconds coming back.  Switching in Staroffice is painful, but
generally the responsiveness feels quite nice.
I like it.  Thanks,
-kb, the Kent who will be staying with 2.4.9-ac15, plus preemption
patch, plus this patch--once he figures out how to close all those
windows.
