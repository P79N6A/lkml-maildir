When using the program vbetool, it says "mmap /dev/mem: Permission
denied".  When I check dmesg, it says "program vbetool is using
MAP_PRIVATE, PROT_WRITE mmap of VM_RESERVER memory, which is deprecated.
 Please report this to linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org"
.. so thats what I did.
If you want any for information, I'd be glad to help.
