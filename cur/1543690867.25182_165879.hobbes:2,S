Yes, logging in via ssh to run this script does reliably crash my
2.6.0-test5, I think because of `chvt $x`, while I am not touching the
console keyboard or mouse.
Cycles required varies.  Counting cycles completed before crashing, I
saw: 1 18 20 20 ... 4 16 ...
The script as was posted creates a small ./X and produces logs such as:
Cycle 1 switching to VT 1
Cycle 1 switching to X
...
Cycle 20 switching to VT 1
Cycle 20 switching to X
Cycle 21 switching to VT 1
This log could have been produced by crashing in `chvt $vt`, but I think
I saw it was produced by crashing in the `sleep $wait` that follows
`chvt $x`.  That is, I think the $vt was the last non-blank display, not
the $x.
To increase my confidence, I ran with every command echoed, and indeed
via ssh I saw the last command echoed was `sleep 5`.
I ended by running the third variant script quoted below.  Now my logs
comfortingly end with 'switching to X'.  I presume I'm catching the
crash in the last sleep $wait.

while ((1)); do
	echo Cycle $cycle switching to VT $vt | tee -a $log
	sync
	sleep $wait
	chvt $vt
	sleep $wait
	echo Cycle $cycle switching to X | tee -a $log

	sleep $wait
	chvt $x
	sleep $wait
	((cycle += 1))
done
