Good news!

It's funny, yesterday I got my hands on mii-diag as well. I reduced it
to just a few lines of code that check the link status and was going to
daemonize it today. I cc'ed Thomas Davis on this. I was thinking though
more in lines of not executing the scripts, but taking the code from
ifenslave to enslave or relase the interface in the daemon itself. So
your ifrelease comes very handy indeed. I understand that ifrelease
requires your patch to the bonding driver, does it not?
Thanks for the patch and the code.
