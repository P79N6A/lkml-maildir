I am still trying to understand the whole proposal to give you better
feedback. But, my gut feeling is - its not going to be any more simpler
than what we have today :(
Andrew did an excellent job when he started (with the set of
requirements we had at that time). Then we started adding more
and more features/corner-case fixes/functionality/locking fixes/error
handling cases etc - which added all the complexity. 
I think it deserves a cleanup, but afraid to touch it - since its
going to take few months to stabilize it and get it right. We need
to collect all the test cases before undertaking this.
Thanks,
Badari
