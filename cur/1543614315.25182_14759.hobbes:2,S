Hi!
When trying to mount an ISO9660 CD on my USB CDRW unit, I get lots
of "sr: unaligned transfer" messages from the kernel and the mount
command fails. This message was added in kernel 2.5.1 and the
sr_scatter_pad() function was removed at the same time. The comment
above the message hints that unaligned transfers are (or were) a
normal thing.
I added a printk to get more information:
        sr: unaligned transfer
        sr: sector 64, s_size 2048, bufflen 1024
        sr: unaligned transfer
        sr: sector 68, s_size 2048, bufflen 1024
        sr: unaligned transfer
        sr: sector 72, s_size 2048, bufflen 1024
        ...
        sr: unaligned transfer
        sr: sector 396, s_size 2048, bufflen 1024
        Unable to identify CD-ROM format.
So, what changes are needed to make CD support work?
