I know that I've seen many projects that are working on or claim to have 
suceeded in being able to do live migration of processes from one system to 
another. has anyone looked at useing any of these mechanisms for snapshoting the 
user processes for the std situation? if you can do this a process at a time you 
may be able to avoid the massive blob of a write
instead of what linus was saying
buff = snapshot()
write(buff)
it would be
start_snapshot()   /* stops all userspace schedulers except for this process */
foreach(pid) {
   buff = snapshotpid(pid)
   write(buff)
}
