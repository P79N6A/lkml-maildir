Subject: [ALSA][6/6] Don't leave crap in /sys after module exit.

Here's a fun one. modprobe snd_dt019x.c when you don't have the hardware.
It fails to detect as expected, but doesn't stay around, so you don't
even need to rmmod it afterwards. Unfortunatly, it leaves around crap
in /sys/bus/pnp/drivers/dt019x  which buggers up any subsequent usage of
the pnp code. Fix is easy : Keep the module around even when things fail.
