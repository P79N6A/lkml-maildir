As long as your patch doesn't soil its diaper.

We should have done that from day one.  If there's an architecture out
there which cannot fit its interrupt state into its unsigned long (hard to
believe) then it'll need to pull stunts with cookies and lookups or
something.  And on 64-bit architectures we're using 4 more bytes of local
storage than is needed.
But I don't think we've had enough problems with this particular issue to
justify a kernel-wide edit like that.  And this patch should settle the
issue.
