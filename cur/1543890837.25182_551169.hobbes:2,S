Yes, at run time, but not necessarily at compile time.

I came to the same conclusions as I started to implement the bug-stubs.
The patch (to follow) attempts to satisfy all the concerns you outline
as well as my observation that async_tx requires no factoring for the
!HAS_DMA case.
With the patch non-dma-architectures that try to build code with true
dependencies on the DMA api will fail to link i.e.:
CONFIG_DMA_ENGINE=y CONFIG_HAS_DMA=n ASYNC_MEMCPY=y
  CC      init/version.o
  LD      init/built-in.o
  LD      .tmp_vmlinux1
async_tx/built-in.o: In function `async_memcpy':
xor.c:(.text+0x770): undefined reference to `dma_map_page'
xor.c:(.text+0x798): undefined reference to `dma_map_page'
xor.c:(.text+0x968): undefined reference to `dma_map_page'
Now changing CONFIG_DMA_ENGINE to depend on HAS_DMA (which is more
correct than saying !S390). Results in:
CONFIG_DMA_ENGINE=n CONFIG_HAS_DMA=n ASYNC_MEMCPY=y
  CC      init/version.o
  LD      init/built-in.o
  LD      .tmp_vmlinux1
  KSYM    .tmp_kallsyms1.S
  AS      .tmp_kallsyms1.o
  LD      .tmp_vmlinux2
  KSYM    .tmp_kallsyms2.S
  AS      .tmp_kallsyms2.o
  LD      vmlinux
This also allows include/asm-s390/dma-mapping.h to be dropped.
