Requires too much to work before it's can be made available.
Andrew Morton sent me a proposed patch last night which adds a klogctl
(a.k.a. sys_syslog) which does a printk() from userspace.  It was less
than 10 lines; i.e. probably worth it.  I have hooked this up to
syslog(3) in klibc, although the code is not checked in yet.
