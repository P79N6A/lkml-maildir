FYI, James' fix for sd_init_command etc. is this one:
http://www.kernel.org/git/?p=linux/kernel/git/jejb/scsi-rc-fixes-2.6.git;a=commit;h=c9526497cf03ee775c3a6f8ba62335735f98de7a
It depends on the following patch to apply cleanly (but does not 
actually require it to work and fix the iPod related panic):

Sorry for any confusion I might have created,
