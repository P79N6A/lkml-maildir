It is not, but if you could limit lines to <80 characters, that would
be nice.

Nice idea. This might even benefit normal pc style boxes, if the
performance loss through compression is overcompensated by io gains
(less data transferred).
The tiny problem I see is that most people here have tons of whacky
ideas themselves but lack the time to actually implement them. If you
really want to get it done, do it yourself. It doesn't have to be
perfect, if it works in principle and appears to be promising, you
will likely receive enough help to finish it. But you have to get
there first.
At least, that is how it usually works. Feel free to prove me wrong.
