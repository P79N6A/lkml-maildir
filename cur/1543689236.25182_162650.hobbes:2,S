For a lot of applications we are.  Go talk to your buddies in the processor

How about some data to back up that statement?
Sun: ~11B/year and losing money, heavily server based
Dell: ~38B/year and making money, 99% small box based
If you were gambling with _your_ money, would you invest in Sun or Dell?
