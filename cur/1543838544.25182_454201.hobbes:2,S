Great. 
Hopefully this will combat the recent surge of new custom 
allocators.
Maybe it would be a good idea to first check if Evgeny's tree allocator
is really that much better as he claims and if any ideas from
that one could be incorporated into the new design?

I'm surprised that you add that many indirect calls when writing
code for IA64. I remember during SLES kernel testing we found that
gcc's generation of indirect calls on IA64/McKinley seemed to be rather poor --
in particular we got a quite measurable slow down just from the indirect calls
that the LSM layer added to many paths. I hope that's ok.
I'm not arguing against doing this way btw, just a remark.

What other ones do we have?

I hope the NUMA slab will still perfom well even on non NUMA though.
That will be a common situation on x86-64 (kernels compiled with NUMA,
but running on flat Intel systems)

Does that help with the inefficient dcache/icache pruning?

What does that mean?

Hmm, i'm not sure how allocator intensive AIM7 is. I guess networking
would be a good test because it is very sensitive to allocator performance.
Perhaps also check with the routing people on netdev -- they seem to be able
to stress the allocator very much.
