Subject: [PATCH] reduce inter-node balancing frequency

Nick, we've had this patch floating around for awhile now and I'm wondering 
what you think.  It's needed to boot systems with lots (e.g. 256) nodes, but 
could probably be done another way.  Do you think we should create a 
scheduler domain for every 64 nodes or something?  Any other NUMA folks have 
thoughts about these values?
Thanks,
Jesse
