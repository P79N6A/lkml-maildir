Ahh, my bad. Sorry. It all looked fine and compiled, but yes, I didn't 
boot-test the merge - although I did ask Len to double-check it for me.
Usually these "fairly trivial" merges work without any issues, so I do the 
merge for the maintainer rather than sending an email back saying "it 
didn't merge cleanly, can you do the merge for me". I reserve the latter 
for just the things that look really complicated..
