Yeah.  Maybe just a bitmap built from __NR_ constants?  I don't know  
if we can do it in a way that doesn't require arch maintainer's  
attention.
It seems like it would be nice to avoid putting a test in the  
handlers themselves, and leave it up to the aio syscall submission  
processing.

I'll take a look, thanks for pointing it out.
