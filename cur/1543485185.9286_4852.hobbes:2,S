Well it's fairly true. The __asm__ GNU extensions are used for a lot of
deep-in-the-heart kernel code because 'C' doesn't mess with registers,
hardware, etc. Just in case you think outw(....), inp(..etc..) are
in the 'C' language...check again. Even __inline__ __attribute_packed.etc
aren't 'C' things. They are GNU extensions that make it possible to
run about everything through the same compiler. However, it 'taint 'C'.
Cheers,
