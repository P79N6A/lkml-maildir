I agree. This is userspace job. This can be done very easily using 
device-mapper. I think EVMS does something similar.
I even asked on LKML some time ago about option for disabling kernel 
partition driver (maybe for some devices) from kernel command line to 
allow other tools do the job (because now I have unusable /dev/sda1 and 
usable /dev/evms/sda1 and this leads to stupid mistakes). But there were 
no replies.
