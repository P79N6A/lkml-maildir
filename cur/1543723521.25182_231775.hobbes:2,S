Hi All,
Is there any method to send a signal from device driver to a Daemon
Process? 
Actually I have written a program to generate a daemon process. It was
working fine. I developed the application to send a signal to my daemon
to perform some action based on the signal. It was also working fine.
Now my intention is to send a signal from a device driver to the daemon
process. Is it possible? 
I am not very sure of how to achieve this. 
Please help me address this issue. 
Thank in advance,
Srinivas G
