Ingo,
Coming next are 3 patches to your mutex code that I'd like you to 
consider.  They express my last requests about mutexes.
The first patch is a resent of my trylock rework to allow for a pure 
xchg based implementation.
The second one gives architectures the ability to make lock/unlock 
fastpaths inlined.  As explained in another mail this is almost always 
beneficial on ARM.
And the last patch makes mutex_is_locked() always inlined since I can't 
find a reason why it wouldn't be beneficial to do so, even on x86.
I hope we can agree on them so that I could go back hiding behind 
ARM-specific part of the kernel again.  :-)
Nicolas
