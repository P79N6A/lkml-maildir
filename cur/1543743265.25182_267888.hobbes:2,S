Then it's either (a) not actually a zombie (perhaps stuck in D state),
or (b) its parent is still alive.
A zombie process is just an entry in the process table where the exit
status etc are stored until the parent reaps it--all other resources
(memory, FDs etc) have been released.  So if your "zombie" process is
actually taking up resources (which I think you said in an earlier
post), there's something else at work.
