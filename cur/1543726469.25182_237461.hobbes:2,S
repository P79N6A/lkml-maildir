Hello
Not sure if this is the correct place to ask, I compiled my own
kernel, nothing fancy, mostly default stuff + some additional device
drivers but after trying to load the kernel I end up with the
following error
Failed to load transform for crc32c

This is redhat enterprise 3.0, I was trying a couple 2.6.X serie
kernels and the error was the same each time, I was also trying to
exlcude crc32 options from kernel but it didnt help, I was not able to
find the resolution on google, so here I am asking for help, thanks
