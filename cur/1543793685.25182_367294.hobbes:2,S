The following code/comment is in <linux/mmzone.h> if SPARSEMEM
and NUMA are configured.
/*
 * These are _only_ used during initialisation, therefore they
 * can use __initdata ...  They could have names to indicate
 * this restriction.
 */
#ifdef CONFIG_NUMA
#define pfn_to_nid              early_pfn_to_nid
#endif
However, pfn_to_nid is certainly used in check_pte_range() mm/mempolicy.c.
I wouldn't be surprised to find more non init time uses if you follow all
the call chains.
On ppc64, early_pfn_to_nid now only uses __initdata.  So, I would expect
policy code that calls check_pte_range to cause serious problems on ppc64.
Any suggestions on how this should really be structured?  I'm thinking
of removing the above definition of pfn_to_nid to force each architecture
to provide a (non init only) version.
