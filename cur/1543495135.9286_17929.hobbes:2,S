   I'm not sure if I can say that 2.2.7 _fixes_ the apache problem or
   merely _masks_ it. 
It does fix the problem, there were erroneous 200ms delays at the
start and end of every TCP connection when talking to broken BSD and
Microsoft stacks and a workaround for these systems was implemented by
me in 2.2.7 which cures it.
Plain and simple.
