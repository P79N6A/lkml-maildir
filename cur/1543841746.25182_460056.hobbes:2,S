I think you misunderstood my comment. What I meant to say was that there is
_no way_ you can compile a filesystem that has only dentry ops but not
superblock ops - this would happen if you tried to bisect and you landed
half way in the series of commits for the filesystem. For the _initial_
commit one cset makes sense. For subsequent fixes one commit per fix is the
only logical thing to do.
