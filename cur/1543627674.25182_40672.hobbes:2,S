ho-hum.  Presumably an unreservepage() got lost somewhere
in the diff shuffling.
All I'm doing with the delayed-allocation code at present
is keeping the diffs up to date.  I haven't even compiled
that stuff for over a week.  All work at present is against
dallocbase-70-writeback.   It's probably not a good use of
your time to test anything beyond that.  Sorry about that.
I'll leave the later diffs available so anyone who's interested
can see the multipage bio assembly stuff, but "dont use".
