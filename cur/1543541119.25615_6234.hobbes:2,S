Stephen,
I sent the attached patch to apm linuxcare that you seem to think has
already been applied to the kernel. I don't think so. I never sent it to
Linus or the list, and have not seen it in any test6prex.
The problem I addressed was that there was a cli() instead of an
APM_DO_CLI
in int suspend(void);
I've been running with the patch I submitted to fix this problem for
some time.
Your solution to do an sti() in APM_DO_CLI seems quite ugly. I grant
that we do not want to do a cli before suspending, but I could not find
anybody else doing that, so just not doing is probably sufficient.
