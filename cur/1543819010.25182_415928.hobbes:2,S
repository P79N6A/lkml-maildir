__nla_* helpers were created for small performance optimisation
if reservation is heavily used.
nla_* helpers were created to be used, but not to be removed or
commented. Some of them are used in generic netlink family.
Others and genl_register/unregister_ops() might be used in recenly 
announced accounting patches.
genl_unregister_ops() is supposed to be used in, for example, 
generic netlink exit path (which can not be called though).
Although it is always statically built systems, it is still very
convenient way of netlink usage for others (future modular systems).
