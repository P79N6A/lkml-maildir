Customers also like to buy hardware where they -know- support will not 
disappear in a year, when the vendor releases a new chip.
In fact, in some markets, the engineers who wrote the code have often 
moved to the next project, by the time the customers actually get their 
hands on the end result.  Open source means that problems found in real 
world field testing can be readily debugged and fixed.
