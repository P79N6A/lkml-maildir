If you are only having task based accounting then yes the first
container using a page will be charged.  And when it hit its limit then
it will inactivate some of the pages.  If some other container now uses
the same page (that got inactivated) again then this next container will
be charged for that page.
Though if we have file/directory based accounting then shared pages
belonging to /usr/lib or /usr/bin can go to a common container.
