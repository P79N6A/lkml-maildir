Because some people asked, I dropped a development snapshot of the 
RAID-6 code at:
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/hpa/raid6-20021126-dontuse.tar.gz
THIS IS NOT A WORKING RAID-6 IMPLEMENTATION.  It's my current 
development snapshot, and attempting to use it *will* result in crashes 
and kernel panics.
It does, however, contain a RAID-6 algorithm test and benchmark program 
that should work.
