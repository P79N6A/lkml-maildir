Yup - so far as I can tell, you didn't pick up the base patch that
this current patch fixes.  So, no, I wouldn't expect this patch to
make any sense.
As I stated in this current patch in the diffstat section after the
'---' marker, this current patch applies to the base patch of Subject:
  [PATCH] cpuset and sched domains: sched_load_balance flag
You probably didn't pick up that base patch because Nick and I are
still haggling over it.  Well ... we've agreed, but I can't get the
scheduler to work as I thought Nick wanted, and I'm still waiting
to hear from Nick again.
==> So yeah - throw this current patch out.
Nick ... you there ?
