The DSS performance has regressed by 11% on 2.6.9-rc2
We are investigating. Any ideas?
However sysbench and iozone show better results.
http://eaglet.rain.com/ram/Readahead.html
 
has the progress graphs for the results of 2.6.* kernel series.
I plan to keep these graphs up2date across releases.
And add more readahead relevent benchmarks in the tracking list.
Thanks,
RP
