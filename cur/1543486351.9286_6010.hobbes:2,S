This is nearly always due to a hardware fault: either main memory or
cache.  We have seen no signs of such a fault reported in 2.2 from
anywhere else, but I'd like to see such reports if there are any.  
Is the same system rock-solid under identical load in 2.0 kernels, and
if so, what drivers are you running?  Does disabling EIDE DMA help?
