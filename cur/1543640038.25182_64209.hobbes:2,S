Right, I do understand that Kerberized/GSS NFS is not exclusive to NFSv4.  
However, right now, there is only one way to get Kerberized NFS. The CITI
NFSv4 patches.
Those patches are, in their estimation, ready for inclusion.  NFSv3 
support is "coming down the pipeline". 
I would rather see Kerberos V5 NFS data integrity and privacy support
first (also in the pipeline).  What the current status of including crypto
in the kernel?

I wasn't aware of this.
