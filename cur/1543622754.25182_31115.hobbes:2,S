Doesn't necessarily help. I recently saw a hard drive which made funny
noises and got really slow reading some parts of the drive (~30MB/s on
some parts, ~300kB/s on others), but ide-smart didn't report failed
tests. Two days later the drive was dead...
It was an IBM 60GB drive, but I don't remember the exact type. It
called itself "IC35L060AVER07-0".
