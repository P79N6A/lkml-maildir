Ok this should fix the e820 memory detection, against 2.2.19pre2:
	
ftp://ftp.us.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/andrea/patches/v2.2/2.2.19pre2/e820-fix-1
While fixing the code I noticed some bug was inerith from 2.4.x so I forward
ported the fixes to 2.4.0-test13-pre3:

I also include them below so they're handy for Linus:

The above patches doesn't include the fix for the thinkpad from Marc Joosen,
a backport of such bugfix is separately backported here (because it's
orthogonal with the other bugfixes):
