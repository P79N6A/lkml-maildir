A much improved version of this driver will hopefully show up real soon in the
latest test12 kernels. We, i.e. Thomas Woller from Cirrus, me and some others,
did a lot of work on the driver lately. The new driver even supports mmap sound
so that most of the games work ;)
Some others reported system freezes with the old (test11) driver which are
fixed now too.
The patch has alread been sent to Linus and will hopefully show up in test12
real soon.
