Hm, I think there's still a problem here.  In the current code, you can
legitimately flush lazy mode with preemption enabled (ie, there's no
lazy mode currently active), but it's always a bug to enable/disable
lazy mode with preemption enabled.   Certainly enabling lazy mode with
preemption enabled is always a bug, but you could make disable
preempt-safe (and the bug checking should be in the common code).
