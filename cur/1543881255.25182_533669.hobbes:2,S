Yes, even on UP different threads accessing the same data could race.
Mutexes (== binary semaphores) are *required* to synchronize access to
shared data.
You might be confusing mutexes with spinlocks. Spinlocks _are_
compiled away on UP (actually !CONFIG_SMP && !CONFIG_PREEMPT) kernels,
but that is still safe because spinlocks are busy-waiting loops
(unlike mutexes and semaphores that block) and hence no thread is
allowed to sleep when holding a spinlock.

Mutexes / binary semaphores / spinlocks are used to synchronize access
to shared data by *multiple* threads ... there is no meaning in
locking access to something if we know only one thread will ever touch
it.
