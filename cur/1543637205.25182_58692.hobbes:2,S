But that's not what's happening here, the pointer is being cast, if the
object of the pointer is not u32, then casting the pointer doesn't fix the
real problem. If the "data" pointer points to a u8, then no casting will
make it work right when you save 32 bits into an 8 bit space. If this
changes the problem it's because of alignment, perhaps.
You give neither the kernel version nor the architecture, so I can't be
sure what's happening or what the compiler might do. I don't find that
code in the kernel I have on this machine (2.4.19-pre7-jam6) but that
diesn't mean much. The routine in hardware/hwregs.c on my kernel would
seem to pass the width correctly, but clearly this is a very different
version.
I think the cast is just to avoid the compiler whining about types, the
version I have is actually type "(acpi_generic_address*)" not (u32*), I
would think the compiler would still complain, but maybe only with
-pedantic or whatever.
In any case only the number of bits requested should be written, the
problem may have been avoided rather than fixed.
