Subject: Via-Rhine driver update breaks it on Alpha

Recently I was working with 2.2.10-ac10 on DP264 alpha with Via-Rhine
ethernet card.  It turned out that an update to its driver had the
following unfortunate effect:
via-rhine.c:v1.01 2/27/99  Written by Donald Becker

eth0: VIA VT3043 Rhine at 0xa802000, ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff, IRQ 23.
and attempts to use this connection brought, not very surprisingly
as ethernet was basically dead if configurable, messages like that:
....
eth0: Transmit timed out, status ffff, PHY status ffff, resetting...
....
Backing out via-rhine sources to a version included in 2.2.10, without
touching anything else, resolved the problem immediately (note
different memory address):
via-rhine.c:v1.00 9/5/98  Written by Donald Becker
  
http://cesdis.gsfc.nasa.gov/linux/drivers/via-rhine.html
eth0: VIA VT3043 Rhine at 0x9800, 00:50:ba:a1:a0:78, IRQ 23.
eth0: MII PHY found at address 8, status 0x7829 advertising 05e1 Link 41e1.
eth0: Setting full-duplex based on MII #8 link partner capability of 41e1.
and a connection worked, both 10baseT and 100baseT-full duplex,
without any troubles.
Unfortunately this machine is gone to its rightful owner so I cannot
run further tests on it.  If more information is needed then likely in
the not so distant future I should have an access to something similar
and possibly with via-rhine as well.
