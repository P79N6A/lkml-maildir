True (and fully agreed), but then that particular entry was just meant
to stir up some fog, I didn't really intend to focus on it at all ;)
The project was based on non-clean-room reverse-engineering from the get-go
anyway (5 people working for 3 months),
thus the only way to get this unfortunate hardware non-support situation
resolved would be by trying to get TI (or possibly newer holders
of that technology) to extend its specifications/firmware blessing
to older variants, not just the Android device-related chipsets supported
by their new driver which they now provided, thankfully.
