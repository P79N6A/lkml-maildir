Robert,
please study scripts/kconfig/*, not how one particular frontend is.
The new kernel configurator is actually a big improvement over the
traditional stuff we used to have up to 2.4.  Okay, it is a fact that
xconfig is far from great, but that doesn't matter -- the important
thing is Kconfig provides a clean, generic system for the actual kernel
configuration.  As I already pointed out a fortnight ago or so, the
only config frontend likely to stay in linux.tar in the long run is
menuconfig, serving as a reference to userland people who are certain
to come up with heaps of different Kconfig frontends (that is when
2.6 ships I guess).
If you need a nifty graphical frontend right away, I suggest you
go ahead and write the first off-tree xconfig.
