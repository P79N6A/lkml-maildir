Yup. I have lots of RAM though, so unless I can see the perf increase
from cache effects, it's not desperately interesting to me personally.
If someone could do similar measurements with a puny-cache celeron chip, 
it would be interesting ...

Fair enough. I'm not desperately interested in user-land code at the
moment, personally, but gcc is admittedly more general. Maybe we should
compile gcc itself with -Os ;-) Andi (I think) also made the observation
that the garbage-collect size for gcc3.2 may be rather small.
The observation re low repeat rate is interesting ... might be amusing 
to do some really basic profile-guided optimisation on this grounds,
take readprofile / oprofile output, and compile the files that don't
get hammered at all with -Os rather than -O2. Given their low frequency
(by definition), I'm not sure that improving their icache footprint will
have a measureable effect though.
