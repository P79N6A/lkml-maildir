Just make them variables, and compute them ONCE during boot.
ppc calls calibrate_decr() before enabling the timer interrupt anyways.
time_nsec is easy. 
in a platfrom specific file do (very simplified):
extern unsigned long time_nsec;
void platform_specific_calibrate_decr()
{
	time_nsec = REAL_TIME_NSEC;
}
This (of course) will do nothing about LATCH and ACTHZ that might be
used other places.
