After talking to Alexey, I don't like this patch.
The new module subsystem was supposed to deal with things
like this cleanly, and this patch is merely a hack to cover
up for it's shortcomings.
To be honest, I'd rather just disallow module unloading or
let them stay buggy than put this hack into the tree.
Special hacks are for 2.4.x where things like full cleanups
are not allowed.
