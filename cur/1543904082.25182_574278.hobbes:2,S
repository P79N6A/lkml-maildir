Thanks for your report.  We need to figure out why the 8250_pnp driver
didn't find your serial console device.  Can you confirm that you also
have CONFIG_ACPI and CONFIG_PNPACPI in your .config?
If you have those, and it still doesn't work, can you collect the DSDT
dump, the output of "grep . /sys/bus/pnp/devices/*/*", and the dmesg
from your "legacy_serial.force=1" boot?  Then we can tell which port
the blind probe finds and whether it's described somewhere by ACPI.
Thanks,
  Bjorn
