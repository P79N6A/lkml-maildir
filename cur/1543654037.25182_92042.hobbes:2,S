Were you thinking of dropping the dynamic at the same time
(ie. putting the dynamic and init sections in the tail using the
linker script)?  Hmm, I guess not since you 
I think an "mod_arch_free_partial(struct module *mod, void *start,
void *end)" function which archs could use to do whatever fancy magic
they wanted (eg. trim exception and really drop the pages, or your
vmalloc_drop_pages() function, or nothing at all).  x86_64, sparc,
sparc64, ppc and arm do/will have their own allocators already.

I *really* hate this ElfW(type) notation.  I know it's used in
binutils etc, but it's a visual bitch to parse.  Please please please
at least use the #defines or typedefs within the generic
kernel/module.c so it's readable.
Other than some gratuitous reformatting 8), looks really good.
Implementing PPC now.
Thanks,
Rusty.
