Yes, that's true. Reiserfs chose to not handle any HW errors, this is even
written somewhere in our FAQ.

True. But they are located at the beginning of a block.

Actually I read your email and I do not see why do you think your disk
does 128 bytes atomic writes. I think this is just impossible on IDE
(for UDMA at least).

Ok, I did.
You math was wrong, you forgot to account that your number should be divided
by 128, not 512, since integer itself is 4 bytes long on x86.
(See message from Itai Nahshon <nahshon@actcom.co.il>, August 7th
Message-Id: <200208071443.30551.nahshon@actcom.co.il> if you missed that originally.)

Probably I mssed that part of converstion, then.
As I see the IDE thing, you tell the hardware that you want to write some amount
of _sectors_ to the hard drive, and then feed the controller with necessary
amount of data. If it writes these sectors from the start of the data flow,
what will it do on data transefer timeout?
So I still think that data is written on disk in 512 bytes atomic blocks
until I see IDE device that does otherwise (and then I will probably
dig some IDE datasheet and find out they are violating some spec ;) )

If they still maintain atomic sector writing, that's their right.
