Subject: [PATCH 1/3] zone init check and report unaligned zone boundries
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

zone init check and report unaligned zone boundries
We have a number of strict constraints on the layout of struct
page's for use with the buddy allocator.  One of which is that zone
boundries must occur at MAX_ORDER page boundries.  Add a check for
this during init.
