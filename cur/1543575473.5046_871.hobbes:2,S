The problem here only ever happens at initialisation/first packets. Once the
network interface has been initialised properly it never produces those
messages anymore. Usually it helps to shut the NIC down with ifconfig and
bringing it back up afterwards to properly initialise it.
If you are bored, try to reboot a couple dozen times and see if you still
see it. I have test12-pre7 also.
