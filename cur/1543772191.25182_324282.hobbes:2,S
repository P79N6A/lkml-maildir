I've tracked this down some further. If I comment out these lines in
intel_845_configure:
        /* agpm */
        pci_read_config_byte(agp_bridge->dev, INTEL_I845_AGPM, &temp2);
        pci_write_config_byte(agp_bridge->dev, INTEL_I845_AGPM, temp2 |
(1 << 1));
then I can load intel-agp, suspend and resume and still get correct
interrupts. If I leave then uncommented, then attempting to load
yenta-socket after a suspend/resume with intel-agp loaded results in the
"no PCI interrupts. Fish" error. This is an i855PM device using nvidia
graphics.
