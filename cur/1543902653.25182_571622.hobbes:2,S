Yes.  Not that it's a terribly important issue, particularly down in the
dark and dusty corners where this code lurks.  The "function" as an lvalue
thing would be more obnoxious in some top-level interface.  We probably
already have some :(
If it were mine I'd open-code the "set" and do the "get" as a static
inline.  Or you could leave it as-is and go off and do something more
important ;)
