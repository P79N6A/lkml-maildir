I still do not understand what will break in this case - won't the
external device just ignore the value which the quirk will write into
its PCI_INTERRUPT_LINE register?
Can someone point me at examples of breakage caused by the original
quirk matching non-builtin devices?  The examples of breakage caused by
missing devices are everywhere now :(

I thought about limiting to some range of PCI device numbers on the same
bus as the VIA southbridge, but this range does not seem to be
well-defined even for V-Link devices, and old PCI chips like 82C686 had
an external IDSEL# input and could end up on any device number (they had
only a single multifunction PCI device, however).

Using the host bridge as a trigger definitely does not look correct
(e.g., 82C686 looks like a normal PCI device and could be used in
systems with non-VIA host bridges).

Now this changelog is obviously wrong...

This table is even more incomplete than the original.  I found these ISA
bridge IDs from VIA in my copy of pci.ids:
        0586  VT82C586/A/B PCI-to-ISA [Apollo VP]
        0596  VT82C596 ISA [Mobile South]
        0686  VT82C686 [Apollo Super South]
        3074  VT8233 PCI to ISA Bridge
        3109  VT8233C PCI to ISA Bridge
        3147  VT8233A ISA Bridge
        3177  VT8235 ISA Bridge
        3227  VT8237 ISA bridge [KT600/K8T800/K8T890 South]
        3287  VT8251 PCI to ISA Bridge
        3337  VT8237A PCI to ISA Bridge
        8231  VT8231 [PCI-to-ISA Bridge]
The major problem with this approach is that this PCI ID list will
inevitably get stale, and there will be no easy way to boot the kernel
on a newer system.  And there is no sign that VIA turns away from their
habit of using PCI_INTERRUPT_LINE for IRQ routing...
However, what about triggering the quirk on any ISA bridge from VIA:
	{
		.vendor 	= PCI_VENDOR_ID_VIA,
		.device		= PCI_ANY_ID,
		.subvendor	= PCI_ANY_ID,
		.subdevice	= PCI_ANY_ID,
		.class		= PCI_CLASS_BRIDGE_ISA << 8,
		.class_mask	= 0xffff00,
	}
