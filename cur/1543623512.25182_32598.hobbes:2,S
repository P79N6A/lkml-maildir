Looks to me like the clean fix would be to call init_idle() from
rest_init() before the init() thread is spawned, and remove it from
cpu_idle().  It looks like a pretty straightforward race condition that
no one else has happened to trigger in a bad way.  I'm no scheduler pro,
but I don't see any problems with calling init_idle() earlier.
That fix assumes that bringup of non-primary cpus on other architectures
call init_idle() explicitly before allowing smp_init() to return; this
is true of mips, but I can't vouch for any other arch's.
I'd submit a patch, but I'm sadly lacking in SMP machines for testing. 
Anyone who wants to rectify that, I'm open to charity.  :)
