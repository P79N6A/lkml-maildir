Hello !
I've worked a little bit on the script and tried to make use of the
feedback.
Maybe I've forgotten some things and for sure it is buggy.
I haven't done much testing yet. So, be warned.
But maybe there are some people who like to play with it ... .
Changes:
     changed version numbers
     consider module configuration in .config
     warning for development kernels
     run bzImage if vmlinux was generated and zImage fails
     changed some variables
     configuration can be edited and saved
     options redesigned
You can download it from:
ftp://ftp.cs.tu-berlin.de/pub/linux/incoming/mkkrl-dev
Bye, 
   Steffen
