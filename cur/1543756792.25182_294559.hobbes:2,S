Jody,
This happens every time you connect a device which ends up doing
ISO_LISTEN_CHANNEL. We fixed the device disconnect case in -mm recently.
I had sent you and Andrew an alternative patch which fixes this
dma_pool_create case as well as the dma_pool_destroy case, albeit with a
disadvantage - The patch does pre-allocation of the IR Legacy DMA in
_pci_probe and deallocates it in _pci_remove. However I am not truly
happy with it since it possibly wastes 200K of memory for people who
don't have devices which need it.
As I said earlier, I think the way to fix this is via schedule_work
similar to the disconnect case, but it involves good amount of code
change. I am working on it - any better ideas most welcome.
Dan - Can you try the attached patch - on top current -mm1? (It's pretty
no brainer that it will fix both cases but two testing heads are better
than one.. :)
Thanks
Parag
