Hmm, maybe. But I think I saw couple of such bad sectors that were only 
bad because of power loss in the wild.

Well, at least for XFS everybody tell that it should be used with UPS only 
if you really care about your data. I think it has something to do with 
heavy in-RAM caching this filesystem does.
Anyway, it looks strange to list something very fragile and potentially 
not existing in the requirements... :-)
Could you explain where exactly do you depend on this requirement? And 
what could happen if it is not true?
Thanks,

PS. Do you have any benchmarks of your filesystem? Did you do any longer 
automated tests to prove it is not going to loose data to easily?
