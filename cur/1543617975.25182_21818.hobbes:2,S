If the file descriptor you have was opened O_RDONLY, but you have
write permission on the file itself, then creating a new name for it
would allow you to open it O_RDWR.
I'm not 100% convinced by this argument.  If you really want a
particular user not to be able to write to a file, the certain answer
is to set its permissions appropriately, rather than rely on it having
no name.
One could make the hypothetical flink(2) only work on O_RDWR file
descriptors, or only on files owned by the euid of the calling
process.
