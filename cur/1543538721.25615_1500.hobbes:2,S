Are you using aio?  If so, which aio?  
The default version is provided by glibc, and is for compatibility
rather than performance.  It emulates aio using threads.
Try the newsgroups gnu.utils.help or gnu.utils.bug for help.
You might consider trying the SGI version, see 
http://oss.sgi.com/projects/kaio/
which is more or less native and high performance.
If the above doesn't help, can you post a small test program 
demonstrating the problem?

this kind of thing.
