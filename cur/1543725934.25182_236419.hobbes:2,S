I have 1 GB and I had a setting of 51 (seemed to be perhaps gentoo
default or so) and I especially after a weekend (2 days off) it is
always the "monday-morning-swap-hell" where I have to wait 5min until he
swapped in the apps he swapped out during weekend.
I changed that to 20 now, but I don't know if this will make things
worse or better.

no, but an already diskussed feature that would know, not to swap out
much used apps (eg mozilla which is used all the time, or openoffice)
during night or long idle times, if not _really_ needed.
