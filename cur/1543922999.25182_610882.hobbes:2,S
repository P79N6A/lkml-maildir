Is this a nice idea to go inside device drivers and filesystem and
make changes in kernel source code to enable RT.
RT related change should be in header files, so that we don't need to
make changes for drivers or filesystem source files.
And when user will disable RT then these patches will again make problems.
We need to find some better alternative.
Thank you,
Jaswinder Singh.
