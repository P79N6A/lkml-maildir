Hmm... you wrote "there was nothing, and I wrote a page."  It matters
little to me how vfork comes to be documented.  That said, I wonder 
if some other motive is at play...
In September, you and I corresponded via email on this very topic.  I 
offered to develop the fork/vfork man page revisions, you responded with:

	Yes, please.
	Make sure that you do not delete the old text, but make the text
	conditional on libc and kernel version.
	Before Linux 1.1.92 ... Since 1.1.92 ...
	Libc 4 and 5 and glibc 2.1 have ... glibc 2.2 has ...
	Best regards, Andries
The next day revisions were submitted.  You acknowledged receipt, 
and offered some constructive criticism:

	Thanks!
	I suppose I'll remove the CONTRIBUTORS section -
	such things tend to cause confusion
	(are the people listed those that wrote the programs
	or those that wrote the man pages?)
	and users are really not interested in seeing a list of names.
	There is a global credits list, and each file has a history
	in the comments.
	Best regards, Andries
Nothing further was forthcoming until this thread started.
Shrug.  I appreciate your efforts in keeping the man pages current.  
As for me, my satisfaction comes mucking about in the code.
