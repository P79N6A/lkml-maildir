Well, only root (or anyone having a special capability) can call
setgroups() and there are much easier ways for programs to eat all
memory than calling setgroups(). I've seen it before happening with
all sorts of limits: one day someone exceeds that limit and the next
thing which will happen is that the sysadmin has to increase that limit.
I don't see any real benefit from such a limit but on the other hand
no real objection either when it uses the sysctl interface.

Thanks! Finally someone who noticed this patch.

Yep! Even with source it is a nuisance having to compile it again
because someone used statically compiled limits.

Me too. But there exist something called AVL (binary tree, balanced)
which is much more scalable. I believe it is already in the kernel.
