But, isn't it required for us to be allowed to run on _every_
CPU in that group. If we take intersection and continue if
that's not empty, then there could be CPUs in group that are
not allowed. Since any CPU then can be the idlest in that
group we can be assigned to a CPU that is not allowed.
Missing something?

Will do it.

Sure. But I'll wait EOT and do read something more to fill
the gaps.

LOL. Hope next one'll do.
Meanwhile, what is the problem with that patch? Not traversing
the CPUs correctly or continue;ing is wrong?
	for_each_cpu_mask(i, group->cpumask) {
		if (!cpu_isset(i, p->cpus_allowed))
			continue;
	}
Thanks for comments.
