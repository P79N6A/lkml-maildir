Subject: [PATCH] More Configure.help fixes
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Dag Wieers caught all the double word's in Configure.help (from the
looks of the patch we're quite a bunch of stutterers), here's another
patch that catches mainly some combined words, a '2.3' -> '2.4', and
inproper capitalizations.
Also, two of the translation's for Configure.help have stale URL's...
I've XXX'd them, and sent a mail to the addresses for the maintainers
of the Spanish and Italian translation to see if there is a new URL.
The patch applies to 2.4.0 clean and to -ac4 with a bunch of offset
warnings, but manages to match all the hunks. (go, patch!)
