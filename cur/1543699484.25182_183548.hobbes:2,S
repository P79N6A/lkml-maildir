With apic/io-apic enabled it crashes hard during boot (with oopses, as I
recall).  I haven't tested apic support with the fixup patches.
The kernel is 2.4.23 plus the patches from "Fixes for nforce2 hard
lockup, apic, io-apic, udma133 covered"
(http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=107080280512734&w=2) and
athcool was running. (Its currently disabled, to see if that might have
something to do with it.)  The machine hasn't been rebooted since the
oops, since it seems to be limping along.  (I did find some minorly
corrupted data earlier; libbz2 had to be reinstalled.  Once its
straightened out I'll run debsums against it and fix up anything that
got mangled..)
The same oops was occurring in stock 2.4.22.
