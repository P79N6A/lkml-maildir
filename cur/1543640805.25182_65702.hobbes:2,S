I upgraded a machine with a 3ware RAID controller running 2.2.20 to 
2.4.19-ac1.  The next day it lay dead.  On the screen was a
message about 3ware: AEN overflow.
I upgraded to 2.4.19-ac4.  24 hours later the same message was on
the screen.
I downgraded to 2.4.19 and have had 7 days of uptime.
The load on the machine is very constant.
I've can't say I've done enough testing to confirm that its an ac
issue.  Just something I came across.
