I suspect I'm talking about something quite similar -- user-level
threads, but enough kernel-level contexts to keep all the CPUs active.

Stacks are allocated automatically on demand.  To be more precise, all
threads have a local stack frame when they run, but whenever an object
returns to the "main loop" (for want of a better term), its stack frame
can be reused -- there is no stack state to preserve.  But if it blocks
within the object's own functions, the stack frame is locked by that
thread.
In practice, this means what I'm proposing has to combine efficient
object-based thread dispatch with efficient pthreads-style threading.
I think it can be done.

It's not quite enough unfortunately.  The problem of what to do when a
blocked process unblocks is tricky, if you want performance as well as
nice implementation.

The simulated objects thing I brought up was to indicate just how fast I
feel "context switching" (if you can call it that) is intended to run,
concurrently with heavier LinuxThreads-style threads.
[ Aside: I am working with a group that has been using LinuxThreads to
  do numerical calculations and data acquisition over a network.
  Context switching performance, as well as network latency absolutely
  sucks, even though there are only a small number of threads active at
  a time.
  To make that application work well, user-level threads are being
  implemented.  (Not the same as what I'm proposing).  These _are_ threads
  with stacks, so could in principle be used in place of a LinuxThreads
  mechanism.  But they are only interested in their application, so it
  will not be a replacement.
  From what I have seen, this means LinuxThreads performance has ways to
  go before its performance is good enough.  I think (but I'm not certain
  yet), that the mechanisms we've been talking about can be used to get
  that performance and still have pthreads-like semantics. ]
