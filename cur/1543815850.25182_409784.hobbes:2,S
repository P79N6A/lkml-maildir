Holy cow.

Rather than replacing the whole lot four times I'd really prefer to see
precise descriptions of these problems, see if we can improve the situation
incrementally rather than wholesale slash-n-burn...
Once we've done that work to the best of our ability, *then* we're in a
position to evaluate the performance benefits of this new work.  Because
there's not much point in comparing known-to-have-unaddressed-problems old
code with fancy new code.

2.6.16-rc6 seems to do OK.  I assume the cyclic patterns exploit the lru
worst case thing?  Has consideration been given to tweaking the existing
code, detect the situation and work avoid the problem?
