Yes, as is the way it is done right now. There's room for userspace to
massage the request a little but right now it /really shouldn't/
because that's not co-ordinated with the driver.

Yes, perhaps it is, but that's how it is now. The point of my mail was
that right now we have zero way to package up a kernel when the
firmware is out-of-tree and this is rapidly becoming reality so we
need a solution right away.

Yes, but remember that you then have to embed lots of driver logic in
userspace. Since it's unlikely that driver writers are going to be
able to invest lots of time in keeping what they're doing in sync with
special handling in udev, I think that approach is also a mistake. Do
you really expect to push updated logic into udev every time you
update your driver for a quick hardware change? really?

I think it's a mistake to take that logic out of the driver proper. To
say "we'll just have userspace figure it out" is asking for weird
undebugable situations. I'm not in favor of bloat, but this is hardly
bloating the kernel - most drivers are going to request firmware by
filename right now, so let's just have a way to export that filename
for the moment at least.

I own a speedtouch here myself. I had to extract the firmware by hand
and install it. Unless something has changed, this means that we're
not going to get into a situation where that firmware is being shipped
out due to the licensing on it. I get your point (sort of) but I think
you're overcomplicating this for the sake of drivers like speedtouch
where none of this logic works anyway.
I'm not saying this is a perfect approach. It's /an/ approach, it's
simple and it works right now for many possible drivers. Packagers can
trivially rip out info from modinfo and use it as a list of files to
look for in a package (for example). It's also hardly difficult to
switch to a grand magical solution sometime in the future.
