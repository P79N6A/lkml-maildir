It does to some extent.  You can't explicitly set a voltage with
cpufreq, but the low-level drivers will match a voltage to a speed
on chips that we know enough info about.

I'm glad I'm not the only one who feels he's too dumb to see
the advantages of this. The added complexity to expose something
that in all cases, we actually don't want to expose seems a little
pointless to me.
For example, most of the x86 drivers, if you set a speed, and then
start fiddling with the voltage, you can pretty much guarantee
you'll crash within the next few seconds.  They have to match,
or at the least, be within a very small margin.
Given how long its taken us to get sane userspace parts for cpufreq,
I'm loathe to changing the interfaces yet again unless there's
a clear advantage to doing so, as it'll take at least another 12 months
for userspace to catch up.
