And Debian :-( It is hard to get rid of such file - GNU 'rm' complains
too, as it tries to stat that file first :-( Fortunately
echo -n > x; rm x
works. I filled bugreport some time ago (when 2.1.94 come to woody), but 
it was closed, as there are no 2.4.x headers in Debian, so it is not 
possible to recompile glibc against them... Recompiling glibc is enough 
for woody, BTW.
