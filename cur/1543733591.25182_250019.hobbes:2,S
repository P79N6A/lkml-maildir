I don't know about the above but for a multi-domain system the
way it works is that the I/O ports are accessed using a different
base address for each domain.
On my box I/O space looks like:
7ffed000000-7ffedffffff : SCHIZO0 PBMA
  7ffed000300-7ffed0003ff : 0000:00:04.0
    7ffed000300-7ffed0003fe : qlogicfc
7ffef000000-7ffefffffff : SCHIZO0 PBMB
  7ffef000300-7ffef0003ff : 0001:00:06.0
    7ffef000300-7ffef0003ff : sym53c8xx
  7ffef000400-7ffef0004ff : 0001:00:06.1
    7ffef000400-7ffef0004ff : sym53c8xx
SCHIZO is the PCI controller name, there are two PCI segments.
davem@nuts:~$ ls /sys/devices/pci*
/sys/devices/pci0000:00:
0000:00:00.0  0000:00:01.0  0000:00:04.0  detach_state
/sys/devices/pci0001:00:
0001:00:00.0  0001:00:03.0  0001:00:05.2  0001:00:06.1
0001:00:01.0  0001:00:05.0  0001:00:05.3  detach_state
0001:00:02.0  0001:00:05.1  0001:00:06.0
davem@nuts:~$ 
So to access some VGA port on domain zero the
address would likely end up being:
	0x7ffed000000 + VGA_FOO
This is a real touchy area btw, because if there is no
VGA card, such I/O port accesses are going to trap and
we need to have a common way to handle that somehow.
