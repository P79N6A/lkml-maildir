That's onviously not true at all.  To handle any filesystems using intents
(e.g. NFSv4) you need to do much more.  Then again doing things correctly
doesn't seem to be interesting to the stackable filesystems crowd an this
problem has been constantly ignored over the last year, including merging
ecryptfs which has been broken in the same way.
Folks, if you want your stackable filesystem toys taken seriously you
need to fix these kind of issues instead of talking them away.  And yes,
this will involve some surgery to the VFS.
