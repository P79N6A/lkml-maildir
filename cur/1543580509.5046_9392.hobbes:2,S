It works, until somebody does this
 make -j 4 modules modules_install
There is not, and never has been, any interlock between make modules
and make modules_install.  If you let modules_install run in parallel
then people will be tempted to issue the incorrect command above
instead of the required separate commands.
 make -j 4 modules
 make -j 4 modules_install
You gain a few seconds on module_install but leave more room for user
error.
All of this is cleaned up in the 2.5 kbuild system (work in progress).
I have carefully coded the 2.5 kbuild system so it can be used on 2.4
kernels as well.  If you don't mind being an earlier adopter, this will
be fixed in a few weeks.
