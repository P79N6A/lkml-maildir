Here's what I see when I call cdrecord on SuSE 9.1:
Cdrecord-Clone-dvd 2.01a27 (i686-suse-linux) Copyright (C) 1995-2004 JÃ¶rg Schilling
Note: This version is an unofficial (modified) version with DVD support
Note: and therefore may have bugs that are not present in the original.
Note: Please send bug reports or support requests to 
http://www.suse.de/feedback
Note: The author of cdrecord should not be bothered with problems in this version.
This states very clear that the original authour should not be bothered.
So I don't see any problem.
