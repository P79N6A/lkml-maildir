The early drives haven't changed, but the drivers for the controllers
which they were tested on changed (or will change soon). Namely the
lists of PIO mode limits were wrong very often. This is mainly because
some of the (now almost unused) drivers program the timings incorrectly
into the controller registers.
I can't say much about the more recent entries, except for that it'd be
nice to add a date when the entry was last tested and with what result
to each of them over time.
