Hi,
Just to let people know that 2.4.0-test12-pre3 behaves much better than
earlier versions on my 6G RAM machine. Not only /proc/mtrr is correctly
showing all 6G cached for write-back but also I so far I never had to
up/down one of the eepro100 interfaces to get it to work -- something I
hda to do in all previous versions. (without david-mtrr.patch)
Regards,
Tigran
