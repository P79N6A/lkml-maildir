Thanks. While we are at it, what do people thinks about this
very humble wiki page? (ie, does it have sense or I'd better remove it?):
http://wiki.kernelnewbies.org/wiki/LinuxChanges
I'm trying to do something useful, ie like:
http://wiki.dragonflybsd.org/index.php/DragonFly_Status
(yes, I also hate wikis, but if people knows of a better "colaborative
environment" crap which works even with lynx and using it is as easy
*cough* as writing text in a text form in lynx I'm all ears.
http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/
 is also a great example of why kernel could benefit
from using a wiki)
