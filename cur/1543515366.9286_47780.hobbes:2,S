Greetings.  This is probably someting simple and stupid, but I think I've
wasted enough time searching for the answer.
On 2.3 kernels, keyboard input doesn't work. I beleive this is a Unix98
problem, or somesuch, but I can't seem to fix it.
Keyboard does work in Xwindows, but not in xterm.  SSH'ing from a remote
machine also does not work.  Local text console also does not work.
However, if nothing is accepting input, and I press keys, the correct
characters are displayed, so the keyboard itself is wokring, and the scan
codes are getting through.
I am attempting to use Unix98 ptys.  I have /dev/pts mounted, and
/dev/ptmx is as it should be.  There is nothing in /dev/pts though.
Any shells/xterms/etc that I run, use up 100% cpu, while not getting my
input.
I am currently using 2.3.24 although I have had this problem on every 2.3
kernel I have tried. (starting around 2.3.10 I'd guess ).
Can anyone shed some light?
