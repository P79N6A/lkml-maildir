Heh. I hadn't enabled CONFIG_BCM43XX_DEBUG myself, but I just changed
it for my next kernel build.  This is a slightly different issue,
which is that sometimes _DEBUG options shouldn't be turned on by
default (because they really trash performance and bloat log size),
and sometimes they are painless to turn on and don't cost much.
If that is the case, I'd suggest removing the option and just making
it compiled in by default with a run-time option to enable it.
