With difficulty. A normal syscall wouldn't generally go through the lcall7 
handler. Some of the ABI/iBCS code gets access to the struct pt_regs 
though. It's probably not the best way to go, though.
Try something along these lines...
int (*sys_win32_handler)(args...);
EXPORT_SYMBOL(sys_win32_handler);
int sys_win32(args...)
{
	ret = -ENOSYS;
	if (current->personality != PER_WIN32) {
		if (sys_personality(PER_WIN32))
			return -ENOSYS;
	}
	/* Now the process has the WIN32 personality, so until it
	   exits, we know the module cannot be unloaded.
	 */
	return (*sys_win32_handler)(args...);
}
	
Code your win32 support module to register the PER_WIN32 personality, and 
set the sys_win32_handler pointer appropriately. Probably not in that order.
