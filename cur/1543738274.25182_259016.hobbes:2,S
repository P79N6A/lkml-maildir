Well the module name is passed in register/unregister_chrdev(). It
was not documented as the allowed length of the name so it was
possible to install a device and then only "partially" uninstall
the device so a subsequent open of the device-file would crash
the kernel.  A device name of :
 	"Octrangle Contrabulator"  23 characters
... in a test program was sufficiently-long to kill the kernel.
I recommend truncating any name to an acceptable length. This
would show up in /proc/iomem, etc., prompting the developer
to shorten the name.
Also, the new length of 20 characters is probably too short.
There was no such limitation on 2.4.x, where many modules
are being ported from.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
