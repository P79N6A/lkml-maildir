Justin, and all of us, are quite content to work in an Open Source
environment I believe. It is the true inheritor of the original Unix
philosophies.
But it's difficult to commit to an effort that one often feels is a
waste of time from the git go. This is one of the bootstrapping problems
of the Linux environment: pretty much everyone expects you to produce a
working prototype of a problem solution *before* people will accept it-
how else can they evaluate it, hmm?
But major amounts of work would have to be expended before you would do
something like present 'CAM in linux' for review. That makes for a
natural tendency to try and assess *beforehand* whether there's even a
point in trying. I think that the subtext of Justin's comment, to put
words in his mouth which can later deny if he likes, is that there's a
sense that some of the solutions he'd propose/do would never be
accepted, so why spend an effort sure to be wasted?
