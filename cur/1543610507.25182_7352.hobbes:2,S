Hi all,
I'm trying to compile 2.4.15.
I've read Kernel Howto and I've done the quick compilation steps:
make xconfig
make dep
make clean
make bzImage
cp arch/i386/boot/bzImage /boot/vmlinuz-2.4.15
make modules
make modules_install
What about now?
How do I create system map and modules info?
What are they for?
I feel that kernel howto is not explicit with this questions.
Is there any place where can I get insight about these questions?
Best regards,
