You probably just need to add more swap space on your system,
Any time the OOM killer fires, something's wrong with the
system, and it's more productive to deal with that than to
wish for a more accurate OOM killer; see

When I was working at a company that used embedded Linux,
I eventually figured this out, and patched the kernel to panic on OOM
conditions; that gave users the right incentive to avoid
configuring jobs that caused the system to run out of memory.
