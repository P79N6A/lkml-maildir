Yes it works on non hotplug motherboards, it's only a logical offline.

None at the moment as we busy loop, so if anything, power consumption
would go up. What could be done is perhaps 'hlt' the processor and wait
for a RETURN_FROM_OFFLINE IPI. Or perhaps with more work, graft in the
ACPI C state transitions.
