In the case of SSI the process to be migrated is selected  by using
mosix algorithm. If mosix load balancer is   not enabled automatic load
balancing doesn't work. But you can use the migrate() call with "best
node" argument  so that the average load  on the machine is used to
determine which node the process should migrate.

SSI even support  mmap across cluster. That means you can  even ask a
process  that has done a mmap of file  to migrate to another node.

SSI support cluster wide signaling. That means you can send signal to a
process running on other node( you have cluster wide PID )
It also support cluster wide message queue, DLM , cluster wide device
access and  cluster wide IP. The developers are working on cluster wide
support for  semaphore shared memory  
NOTE:  it support three architectures. x86/IA64/Alpha
