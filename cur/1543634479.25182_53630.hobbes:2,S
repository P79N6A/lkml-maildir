No.
Reparenting a process only changes the identity of the parent reference of a
process.
Migrating to another machine has to handle (at a minimum):
1. open files - file id, file pointer values must be moved.
2. network connections must be redirected, existing queues must be transferred
3. shared memory segment references must be transferred, possibly even the
   file referenced by mmap operations (see item 5)
4. semaphores must be transferred
5. disk files may have to be transferred (currently open files in /tmp ?)
6. pipes to other processes must be re-established, as the current contents
   of any pipe buffers, and even the other process(s) attached to the pipe
7. process kernel stack must be preserved (current syscall activity?) and
   process control block state
8. the curren process data must be transferred (memory image, shared
   library references)
9. recreating the same/equivalent process context (pid, ppid,uid,gid, and
   all the kernel setup may/will have to be transferred)
A lot of things NOT mentioned (what about the active buffer cache for open
files... shared file access...)
