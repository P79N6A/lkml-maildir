I probably operate out of a different set of assumptions than most
people do.  If I am responsible for picking up the pieces of a broken
machine things get done my way on the machine.  We have gone round and
round with departments and the like about this issue.  If people want
to have the liberty of replacing kernels and rebooting machines they
get to administrate their own machines, problems and all.
