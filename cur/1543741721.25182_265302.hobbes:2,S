-V0.4.1 could help with this problem. There were a number of places
where the PREEMPT_REALTIME kernel missed reschedules so it could easily
happen that jackd would sit in the runqueue waiting to be executed and
the kernel got quickly out of a critical section but then the kernel
'forgot' to reschedule for many milliseconds!
