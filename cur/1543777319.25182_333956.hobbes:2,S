Erm, if you know how some buffer overflow attacks work then surely the 
answer is "it depends on the application". To tell if an application is 
vulnerable you would have to audit it in some manner. Either by checking 
the source or doing some black-box testing on it.
Even if you did have a great big database of apps and had identifed 
which of them had possible vulnerabilities it would be easier to simply 
fix them rather than get an external system to disallow such inputs.
And not forgetting that you would have to have some way for your IDS to 
tell what app was running behind a specific port. Thought about that yet?

Snort isn't a firewall. Don't mix apples and oranges. Snort is an IDS. 
The current de-facto "firewall" for linux is the iptables suite.
