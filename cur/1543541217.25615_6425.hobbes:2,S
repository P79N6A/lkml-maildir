That seems to be a common opinion.  If anyone else has a different one,
I would like to hear it.  I've heard that regression should come last
and functional should come first.  I think that everything in functional
testing should occur in regression testing, so there isn't much
difference there.

Noted.  Which areas in the kernel are most in need of regression
coverage?  Stress testing?  Dreaming of any tools that you need lately?

One of the goals of LTP is definately to create a unified collection of
useful tests and tools.  Something that a new kernel tester can pick up
to quickly get up to speed.  Aaron has been looking over Juan's tests
and definately likes them.
