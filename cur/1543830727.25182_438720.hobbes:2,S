Ooh, can you share the details of those EPs?  Is your application public?

Well, it is specifically an airprime driver.  My card also presents 
another two endpoints, but I don't know what to do with them, so I 
haven't worried about them too much.  If they all talk the same thing, 
then they may as well be in the same driver.
Are you proposing adding some more protocol knowledge to airprime, or 
just make those EPs appear as more serial ports?
Thanks,
