Hi
I wrote the patch for update so that it doesn't flush buffers when no disk
activity occurs.  It is true that my first patch used /proc/interrupts, but 
this is know changed to /proc/stats (something Pavel sugested).
If you want to be sure that there are no buffers to flush (so that, with your
patch, the disk can spin down), you will have to kill all running daemons.
They all read some file, touch a dir, or something like that.  And that means,
flushing the changed atimes to disk.  With my patch (or with Pavel's bdflush)
I can force my disk to be silent for 12 hours (or more, if you like to).
I don't have to be afraid that I loose any data, because a portable has a
build in UPS (they call it a battery :).  
I can tell you that, from experience (and testing), my updated acurate is
in knowing when it can flush or not.  It only writes something to disk
when it sees that something has been written to disk in the last 30 seconds.
Knowing when a disk is spun up or down is not interesting, becasue if you
have a timeout of 10 minutes, and every minute update flushes buffers when 
the disk spins, your disk will never (or almost never) spin down, because
every time you write something, it will take another 10 minutes before the disk
goes down.  Using /proc/stats seems the best way, unless you want to do
such thing internally in the kernel.
