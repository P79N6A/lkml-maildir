A "hang" sounds like the pmcore bug I reported about a year ago...
It's rather foolish of the PM core to use the same semaphore to
protect system-wide suspend/resume operations that it uses to
for mutual exclusion on the device add/remove (which suspend
and resume callbacks did happily in 2.4) ... since it's routine to
unplug peripherals on suspended systems!
Alternatively, if you're combininging USB_SUSPEND with any
system-wide suspend operation, you're asking for trouble;
the PM core is just not ready for that.  (In fact I've wondered
if maybe 2.6.9 shouldn't discourage that combination more
actively...)
But a keyboard-specific issue might be improved with the
HID patch I posted last week, teaching that driver how to
handle suspend() and resume() callbacks.
