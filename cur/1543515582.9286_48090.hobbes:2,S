Hmmm!!!!!
Linux needs the freedom to change things as it is needed.
Linux offers standard APIs.
Think about it. Think about it as an example of non-open-source stuff
      ___which obviously doesn't follow the offered standards___
and how it puts preasure on open-source! Good ol' M$ tactics, isn't
it.
