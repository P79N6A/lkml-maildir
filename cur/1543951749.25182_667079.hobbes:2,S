So then that's like "my" panic.
The other thing that I see here is that it only happens with my two LSI 
based devices (both CD-RWs), always quickly after SCSI inquiry.
I shall test with my Prolific based DVD-RW to find out whether it is 
about some requests that are sent to CD/DVD-RWs or about the split 
transactions that I get from the LSI bridges.  (See bugzilla.)

Unless you or I spot the real solution earlier, you could also try 
replacing your dma_sync_ with mb() and with mdelay() respectively to see 
what aspect of the dma_sync_ is fixing your setup.  Also move the mb() 
to other interesting places of the involved code.
