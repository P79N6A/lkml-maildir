Hi Linus !
After you tag a "release" tree in bk, could you bump the version number
right away, with eventually some junk in EXTRAVERSION like "-devel" ?
It's quite painful to have a module dir name clash between the "clean"
final tree and whatever dev stuff we are testing out of bk ... it's fine
once you go to -rc1, but in the meantime, it's really annoying.
Cheers,
Ben.
