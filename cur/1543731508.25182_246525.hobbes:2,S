A few more bugfixes:
 - I was confused, it was hex 18, not decimal 16
 - Its/it's again ;-)
 - Only return the bits of the ROM that are in PCI format
 - Remove the actual resource, not some strange static one
 - Delete the static one that wasn't really used.
BTW, what do you think to moving all the ROM code from pci-sysfs.c to a
new file rom.c?  There's not much sense to the ROM accessing code being
mixed in with the sysfs code like this.  After all, we might choose to
expose the ROM in some other way in the future.

the nation that is attacked, and every man will be glad of those
conscience-soothing falsities, and will diligently study them, and refuse
to examine any refutations of them; and thus he will by and by convince 
himself that the war is just, and will thank God for the better sleep 
he enjoys after this process of grotesque self-deception." -- Mark Twain
