Didn't that still have the starvation issues in get_request that
my patch addressed though? This batching is needed due to the
strict FIFO behaviour that my "q->full" thing did.

5) include the "q->full" starvation fix; add the concept of a
   queue owner, the batching process.
I'm a bit busy at the moment and so I won't test this, unfortunately.
I would prefer that if something like #5 doesn't get in, then nothing
be done for .22 unless its backed up by a few decent benchmarks. But
its not my call anyway.
