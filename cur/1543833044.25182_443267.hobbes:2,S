Using interesting frequencies or output power would be fun for
radio amateurs (like me). 2.4GHz is one of our playgrounds after all :-)
Just because Joe Average isn't allowed to use such features doesn't
mean that there aren't any legitimate users for it.
Preventing the accidental use of unauthorized features would be enough, 
I think (warnings that force you to look up the manual to find out the
correct --force option or similar)
I expect developers to be sensible enough to only offer 'public legal'
values in the default options list.
just my 2 cents,
Thorsten
