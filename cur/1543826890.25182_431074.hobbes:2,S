good afternoon,
I have a question concerning cdrom packet writing. I simply
cannot figure out if packet writing supports write once
media like DVD-R, DVD+R too. The docs always speak of
rewriteable media like CD-RW, DVD+RW, DVD-RW, but not about
media without W.
Also, trying to "mkudffs /dev/pktcdvd/cd0" on a non-rewriteable
DVD will fail with an error-message:
"trying to change type of multiple extents".
Reading through <linux/drivers/block/pktcdvd.c>, I get the
impression that only CD-RW, case 0x13: /* DVD-RW */
                case 0x1a: /* DVD+RW */
                case 0x12: /* DVD-RAM */
can be used that way = make an udf fs on the media and
copy files to it.
I this correct?
kind regards,
h.rosmanith
