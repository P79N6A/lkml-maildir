I agree, but I would hope that MLX4_DEBUG *is* enabled in production.
It doesn't print anything or introduce any measurable overhead except
for slightly larger code size unless the debug level is explicitly
increased, so the only reason to turn it off is if a few bytes of code
makes a big difference to you (hence making it selectable only if
EMBEDDED is selected).
