Hi Alan & Bart !
While fixing my hotswap media-bay IDE controller for 2.6, I found
a locking problem with IDE (again ? :) in ide_unregister_hw. Basically
the problem is that it calls blk_cleanup_queue(), which is unsafe to
call with a lock held (it will call flush_workqueue() at one point).
Other side effect, flush_workqueue() will re-enable IRQs, thus allowing
us to get an IRQ while holding the spinlock -> double lock, but that's
just a side effect of calling flush_workqueue in that context.
So the call to blk_cleanup_queue() shall be moved outside of the
spinlock. I don't know much about the BIO details, is it possible
to first unregister_blkdev, then only call blk_cleanup_queue() ? That
would help making sure we don't get a request sneaking in ?
Ben.
