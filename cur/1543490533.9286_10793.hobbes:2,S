Need model number of ASUS board and BIOS revision before we can help, really.
For kicks, check to see if there is a new bios for it at
ftp://ftp.asuscom.de/pub/ASUSCOM
That site is always more up to date than the Japan or USA site, unfortunately.
The same can be said for the Russian USR Robotics site compared to 3com's awful
USA site. My Dual's latest rev on the USA site is from 3/98, the newest on the
Russian site is 12/98.
