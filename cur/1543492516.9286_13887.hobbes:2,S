Okay, here is the million dollar question:
Where and how did you get the driver source code?
If you obtained it through legal means, tell everyone else how you did so,
so they can take a look at it too. Post a URL or something.
If the answer something like is "my brother works for Lucent so I asked
him to get it for me" or "I got it off a warez group" then I'm not
interested and I doubt anyone else on this list is, either. 
If it's a screwup by one of the modem manufacturers--say, a copy of the
driver was release with full debugging symbols (including source) built
into the executables--then you should probably ask them about making a
derived work.

Even if you can write a Linux version, can you legally release it as open
source? Can you even release a binary version?
AFAIK (and this is just speculation, mind you), there are three
non-technical problems that you might face:
1. Would you be breaking the terms of the modem driver license? Is there
any sort of agreement between you and the owner of the code that you have,
such as a non-disclosure agreement, that would prevent you from releasing
your work?
2. Are there any patents that your driver would infringe upon?
3. What about the ITU? Last time I checked, they were charging
decent-sized amounts of money (about $1000 per year per person)  for their
telecom specifications. How much of the ITU specs does the driver reveal,
and is that a problem?

There are a lot of good sources for information on writing Linux device
drivers. Some include The Linux Kernel Hackers' Guide
(
http://khg.redhat.com/HyperNews/get/khg.html
), The Linux Kernel Module
Programming Guide (
http://www.redhat.com/docs/LDP/LDP/lkmpg/mpg.html
),
_Linux_Device_Drivers_ by Alessandro Rubini, another book called
_Linux_Kernel_Internals_ (I forget the author's name), and of course (the
most important one) the kernel source itself. Plus there are probably many
more. 
If you write an open-source DOS winmodem driver, then someone else will
probably port it to Linux for you... the question is, could they (and you)
get sued for doing it?
