sched-domains was supposed to be able to build a whacky topology
so you didn't have to take the occasional big latency hit when
scanning 512 CPUs...
Ideas were: overlapping, non-covering top level domains, or a
SD_BALANCE_ROTOR, which scans only N (< all) groups on each
balance attempt, but more frequently.
