The 128 bytes are split into 2 sectors - I'm not sure if 128 or 64 bytes
is appropriate.

The L2 cache is a 256K-byte cache that holds both instructions
that miss the Trace Cache and data that miss the L1 data cache.
The L2 cache is organized as an 8-way set-associative cache with
128 bytes per cache line. These 128-byte cache lines consist of
two 64-byte sectors. A miss in the L2 cache typically initiates
two 64-byte access requests to the system bus to fill both halves
of the cache line.
