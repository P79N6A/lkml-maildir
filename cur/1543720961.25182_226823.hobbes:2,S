Thanks for the feedback, I'll add your test to those I perform myself.
Some of the control variables for this scheduler have rather arbitrary 
values at the moment and are likely to be non optimal.  I'm in the 
process of making some of these variables modifiable at run time via 
/proc/sys to enable experimentation with different settings.  Hopefully, 
this will enable settings that improve interactive performance to be 
established.
Once again, thanks for the feedback
Peter
