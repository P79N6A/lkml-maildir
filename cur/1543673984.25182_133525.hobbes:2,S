Well, I have actually seen false indications.  Whether they are due to
noise is open to debate.  Since they occur just at the time when I turn
the power to my USB peripheral on or off, that's my best guess.  It might
even turn out that power on/off generates a temporary OC condition, so
fixing that might render the grace period unnecessary.  I haven't had a
chance try it yet.

Yes.  That can be done in any case.

Good.

I will.  Probably won't be ready until some time next week.
