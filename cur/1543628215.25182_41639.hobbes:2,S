Andrea, that's not the _comparison_.
The "fxrestor" replaces the "fninit" too, so you have to take that into
account.

Except it's _never_ cold-cache the way it's coded now. In fact it's always
hot-cache - which are exactly the numbers I posted.

It may have high precision, but since it's testing something that has
nothing to do with the problem at hand, it's basically 100% useless.
