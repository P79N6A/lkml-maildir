You needed that in the "old" (2.2.13 and before) situation as well. Now it's
just explicit, instead of having a non-compiling kernel or a driver that
refuses to insmod.

It's not ideal, but it happens on other situations.

There are other situations just like this. For example the MIRO radio-driver
(ACI) has a similar situation.

That's always a good idea. 
This hole mess is caused by the fact that the current Config.in system
has problems with ordening. msp3400 really needs sound (OSS commercial or
build-in, whatever), but that question is asked later on "make config". This
kind of "forward-dependencies" happen on other occasions as well, and others
are unsolvable at all...
