I seem to be getting more and more patches that have tabs/spaces
broken and line wrap damage. I've dumped a pile in my queue including
some pcmcia support for sh3 and the like
If your patches are getting ignored please mail yourself a copy and
check your mailer works. If you have problems use mime (Linus doesnt like
mime I dont care)
