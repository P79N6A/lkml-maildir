I am a beginner of a driver-developer.
I got some problems.
you know some structs such as "file_operation" were defined in Header Files.when I define a struct in .C files,i always got errors below:
fops has an incomplete type
storage size of 'fops' isn't known
In my .C files , I defined as followed:
.....................
struct file_operation fops;
.....................
How can i solve this sort of problems. Thank you.
