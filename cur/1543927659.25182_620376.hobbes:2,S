With ACPI it seems to be possible to disconnect the uvc device.
I tested the suspend/resume functions by adding a proc interface to
it, and it worked properly.
Although the eee PC also suspends the underlying bus where the usb
controller is connected to (which is PCI or PCIe)

The current state I revealed is that after suspend if the video node
isn't used it's not necessary to reconnect the device nor to reload
the driver again if that reset is implemented.
That eee PC comes with 2.6.21.3 which has no such reset quirk feature
in the usbcore (that's what I initially meant actually).
If a videoapplication accesses the nodes during suspend the notebook
won't come back again.
I also think it's faulty hardware in that case but I'm moreover
looking for a solution for it. My other intel notebook doesn't even
awake from suspend to ram, and for some reason suspend to disk just
didn't work as expected either (Acer Travelmate 660).
thanks for the feedback,
Markus
