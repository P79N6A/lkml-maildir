SGI's code added support for other address spaces in kiobufs.  Either
way, the addresses you pass to IO functions should be kernel virtual
addresses anyway if you are passing kiobufs.
I'm actually working on the kiobuf code right now, mainly to separate
out the locking of pages from the mapping of virtual addresses, and
getting kernel VA mapping functions in place is one thing I'm merging.
