  I have the same problems (since 2.1.85 I think). The diagnostic utility in the ppa package (I can't just now
recall it name) saw well everything but the parport_pc didn't. As I remember the parport_pc code failed when
probing parallel port devices - it send something and it didn't liked what it received and so it said that there's
no device (I tried to bypass these tests in code (;-)) but it doesn't help...). I'm not at home now so
I can't give you further info but if you are interested, mail me.
