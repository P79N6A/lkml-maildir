Here's one for you - I have a new Lenovo t61p with which to irritate
everyone. 
suspend-to-ram is a wipeout, but suspend-to-disk works OK under
2.6.23.
However under 2.6.24-rc1 and -rc4 the machine reboots right at the end of
resume-from-disk.
Am trying to do a git-disect on it but it seems that someone has been
screwing with ata Kconfig and I'm hitting a pile of cant-find-root-disk
bisection points and I can't immediately work out why.  I'll try to find
time to look at it again next week.
