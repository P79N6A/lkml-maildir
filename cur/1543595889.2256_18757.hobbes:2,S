This part is described in the chip's doc here:
	
http://va.samba.org/picturebook/72002_E_.pdf
Look at the page 9 where the connections between the chip and
the video bus are described. The problem is that there are 2 possible
modes (ZV-port or Digital YC), and I'm not sure which one Sony
chose to use...

The lockups happen upon closing xawtv (used with xv output). Let's
say one time in ten runs... Then the X server is dead, but I can
still log in using the network and do whatever I want. But if I kill
the X server the whole system freezes hard.

??? That's not me, it's xawtv, through the XV facilities of the 
X server which writes to the framebuffer... Or maybe I don't 
understand the question...
Anyway, I've retested it with the latest ati.2 binaries and how
the 640x480 xv speed seems to have improved (or something in
my configuration changed, of course :-) ).

I'd like to, thanks.

It won't work out of the box either (it uses only v4l read calls and
doesn't support mmap, it assumes a capture size of 352x288 which this
camera does not support etc). But it should be easy to patch it and
make it work with this camera, just like I did with xawtv.
Stelian.
PS: this hasn't much to do with the kernel anymore, I suggest we
take this discussion off list now. I'm not sure neither if Linus
is really interested in getting a copy of this. :-)
