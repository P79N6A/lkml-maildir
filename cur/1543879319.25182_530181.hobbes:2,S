See Documentation/kernel.txt for kernels >= 2.6.19:
core_pattern:
core_pattern is used to specify a core dumpfile pattern name.
. max length 128 characters; default value is "core"
. core_pattern is used as a pattern template for the output filename;
  certain string patterns (beginning with '%') are substituted with
  their actual values.
. backward compatibility with core_uses_pid:
        If core_pattern does not include "%p" (default does not)
        and core_uses_pid is set, then .PID will be appended to
        the filename.
. corename format specifiers:
        %<NUL>  '%' is dropped
        %%      output one '%'
        %p      pid
        %u      uid
        %g      gid
        %s      signal number
        %t      UNIX time of dump
        %h      hostname
        %e      executable filename
        %<OTHER> both are dropped
. If the first character of the pattern is a '|', the kernel will treat
  the rest of the pattern as a command to run.  The core dump will be
  written to the standard input of that program instead of to a file.
