Whee.. That sounds like a load of crock in the first place, since the
PCI_INTERRUPT_LINE thing should be just a scratch register as far as I
know. However, it doesn't really matter - we definitely should never write
to it anyway, so the VIA behaviour while strange should still be
acceptable.
Anyway, to get back on the original discussion, I think we should remove
the writing, and then make sure that /sbin/lspci (or some other tool) can
be made to easily show either the kernel irq mapping value _or_ the
"original PCI config space" value. At that point I'd agree that /proc/pci
has outlived its usefulness.
(Although I still think the name database is nice to have - I certainly
prefer it over having a lot of drivers having their _own_ name databases
for printout purposes).
