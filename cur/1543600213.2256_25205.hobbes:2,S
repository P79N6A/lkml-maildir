Check the settings of the MTRR's against the frame buffer window.
If they appear not to be configured correctly, you just have to ask the
kernel to fix the thing (a MTRR defined for Write Combining must contain
the address range of the frame buffer).
see: linux/Documentation/mtrr.txt by Richard Gooch for details.
