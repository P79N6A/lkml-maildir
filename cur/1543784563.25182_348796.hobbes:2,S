yes, on 2.6 there are two tunables which are important here. 
dirty_background_ratio is the threshold where the kernel will begin
flushing dirty buffers, so it should change how soon the disk becomes
active.  dirty_ratio changes when the write-throttling code kicks in,
which is what Anthony is seeing.  The purpose of the write throttling
code is to limit the dirtying process to disk bandwidth, so that is a
Feature.  Anthony, try *increasing* dirty_ratio, you can go up to 100,
but you could trigger an OOM if you let it get too high, so maybe try
setting it at 85 or so.  This should effectively disable the write
throttling and give you the bandwidth you want.
