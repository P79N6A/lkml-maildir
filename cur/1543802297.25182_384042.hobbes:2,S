Ingo, 
FYI
I just uploaded my 2.6.15-rt2-sr3 which includes the latest patch to fix
the bug in remove_proc_entry.

Again, the module to test this is here:
http://www.kihontech.com/tests/proc/proc_stress.c
I tested it like the following:
# insmod proc_stress.ko & for i in `seq 1 10000`; do ls /proc/proc_tests; done
