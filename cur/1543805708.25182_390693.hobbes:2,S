Yeah you're right. __GFP_NOFAIL guarantees to never fail but it
doesn't guarantee to actually succeed either. I think the suggested
semantics for __GFP_EMERGPOOL are that while it can fail, it tries to
avoid that by dipping into page reserves. However, I do still think
it's a bad idea to allow the slab allocator to steal whole pages for
critical allocations because in low-memory condition, it should be
fairly easy to exhaust the reserves and waste most of that memory at
the same time.
