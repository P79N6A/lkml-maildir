You will need to disable interrupts if the machine vectors are located at
address 0 (check your boot logs with a recent kernel for a message like
"Vectors relocated to ...").
It's probably best to call cpu_proc_fin(), setup_mm_for_reboot() and
cpu_reset(address) directly rather than making your own copy - these
functions already do the right things for you.  setup_mm_for_reboot()
will remap all of user space with a 1:1 virtual to physical mapping,
and hopefully on the Xscale, the two cpu_* functions do the intended
setup for this (I've not reviewed the xscale stuff in any great detail
yet though).
