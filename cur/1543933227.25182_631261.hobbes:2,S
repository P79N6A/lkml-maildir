Subject: [PATCH] Fix IXANY and restart after signal (e.g. ctrl-C) in n_tty line discipline

Here is a patch that fixes a couple of issues with ttys in the stopped
state.  See patch below for more details.
Note that this patch assumes that my previous patch from last month
(called "tty-enable-the-echoing-of-c-in-the-n_tty-discipline.patch" in
the -mm tree) has been applied, since part of this patch is adjacent to
that code.
					Happy holidays!  Joe
Fix two N_TTY line discipline issues related to resuming a stopped TTY
(typically done with ctrl-S):
1) Fix handling of character that resumes a stopped TTY (with IXANY)
With "stty ixany", the TTY line discipline would lose the first character
after the stop, so typing, for example, "hi^Sthere" resulted in "hihere"
(the 't' would cause the resume after ^S, but it would then be thrown away
rather than processed as an input character).  This was inconsistent with
the behavior of other Unix systems.
2) Fix interrupt signal (e.g. ctrl-C) behavior in stopped TTYs
With "stty -ixany" (often the default), interrupt signals were ignored
in a stopped TTY until the TTY was resumed with the start char (typically
ctrl-Q), which was inconsistent with the behavior of other Unix systems.
