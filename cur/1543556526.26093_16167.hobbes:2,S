Urgh. Linus, AFAICS we _all_ agree on that. The only real question is
whether we consider calling clear_inode() with droppable dirty buffers
to be OK. It can't happen on the dispose_list() path and I'ld rather
see it _not_ happening on the delete_inode() one. It's a policy question,
not the correctness one.
IOW, I would prefer to have BUG() instead of invalidate_inode_buffers()
and let the ->delete_inode() make sure that list is empty. I'm not saying
that current code doesn't work. However, "let's clean after the
truncate_inode_page()/foo_delete_inode(), they might leave some junk
on the list" looks like a wrong thing.
Notice that policy wrt pages is already of that kind - clear_inode()
expects the callers to make sure that ->i_data.nr_pages is zero instead of
trying to clean after them. I think that we will be better off with
similar rules wrt dirty buffers list.
