For some uses a decent PRNG is enough, and the overhead of get_random_bytes()
is much too high.  We've needed something like this for a long time (something
that gives decenly uniform numbers) and hacks to use useconds/cycles/etc do
not cut it.  I for one welcome a simple in-kernel interface to
e.g. get_urandom_bytes() (or net_random() as this is maybe inappropriately
called) that is only pseudo-random but fast and efficient.
Cheers, Andreas
