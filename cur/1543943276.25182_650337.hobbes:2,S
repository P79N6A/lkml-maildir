Actually, I have no idea :) I am right now confused too, I am quite 
surprised that 'nohpet' fixes the problem for you, Chris, even though your 
system doesn't have HPET at all :)
Could you please double-check that 'nohpet' really reliably fixes the 
issue?
I suggested using nohpet as I have already seen reports about such kinds 
of problems on machines that had hpet, but this one seems to be more 
confusing :)
Also, output of the kernel with the patch Thomas provided would be 
interesting.
Thanks,
