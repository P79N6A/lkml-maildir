Thanks for the answer, this means:
It is specific to the arm, mips, mips64 and sparc ports that atomic_read,
atomic_inc and atomic_dec won't work in user space and they do work on all
other architectures.
(my main concern wasn't whether the "#ifdef __KERNEL__" is correct or not
but I was wondering whether there's a reason why it's different on
different architectures)
