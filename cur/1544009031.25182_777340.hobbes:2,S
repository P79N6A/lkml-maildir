My problem is that we can do css_get() after pre_destroy() and
css's refcnt goes down to 0.

It's not problem. please see memcg, it has its own refcnt.
and memcg subsystem is not destroyed at destroy(), now.
What I want to is atomic check to
   "Can I access css->group ?"
   I once tried to do
    --
    rcu_read_lock();
    css_get(&memcg->css);
    if (cgroup_is_removed(&memcg->css.cgroup)) {
         css_put(&memcg->css);
         return 0;
    }
    --
    But this seems not to work.

O.K.
I'll not do extra work on this "notify handler" for a while.
But please, it's now broken.
Hmm...but removing memcg->obsolete flag is difficult. Because
I can't guarantee memcg->css.cgroup is valid pointer.
Can I add a flag CSS_REMOVED ? (set after CGROUP_REMOVED flag) ?
Then, I'll be able to have some work around.
Thanks,
