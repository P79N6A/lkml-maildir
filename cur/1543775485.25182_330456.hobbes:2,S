NFS currently does not currently engender warm feelings wrt ease of
programming and quality in general - especially under Linux sadly enough.
It is also a narrow window through which to speak to the rich set of
options, flags, attributes and features the Linux kernel offers.
I think Solaris used to implement bind mounts through loopback NFS, but that
went out of fashion as well.
