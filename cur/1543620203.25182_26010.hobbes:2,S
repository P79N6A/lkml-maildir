Subject: [PATCH] 2.4.17 panic booting motherboards with hpt372

A repost, yesterday I had the diff -u args reversed. Analysis is the same.
I have a kr7a-raid (hpt372 raid) motherboard.i The 2.4.17 kernel
(plus the 2.4.xx variants on the redhat 7.2 and mandrake 8.1)
panic during boot.
I have found the problem is in ide-pci.c (and a similar one in
hpt366.c) and diff -u follows below.
The code of interest begins at line 835 (2.4.17 base):
The hpt372 returns a class_rev of  5  which is not expected
by the switch statement.
        pci_read_config_dword(dev, PCI_CLASS_REVISION, &class_rev);
        class_rev &= 0xff;
        strcpy(d->name, chipset_names[class_rev]);
        switch(class_rev) {
                case 4:
                case 3: printk("%s: IDE controller on PCI bus %02x dev
%02x\n",d->name, dev->bus->number, dev->devfn);
                        ide_setup_pci_device(dev, d);
                        return;
                default:        break;
        }
The patch makes this code more defensive by using the highest known
class_rev if one is returned which is higher.
Also, for class_rev == 4, the strcpy copies a 7 byte string over
a 6 byte one ("HPT370A" over "HPT366") so I added a strncpy
to make this more defensive as well.
