We agree about most of the facts, and I am too lazy to quarrel anyway.
Such a waste of time. But we draw different conclusions.
We discover that the present combination of 2.6 and parted is
unfortunate. Because of bugs in parted. OK - so lets fix them.
There is nothing especially difficult there.
You prefer a larger change to the kernel above a smaller change
to parted, where the change to parted fixes parted, and the change
to the kernel makes the kernel buggier. I do not.
You say that other utilities are affected. Maybe, yes.
So let us look at them. In the time spent writing all these
letters we probably could have fixed a few.
