Subject: 'C' calling convention change.

The new Red Hat Fedora release uses the following gcc version:
 	gcc (GCC) 3.3.3 20040412 (Red Hat Linux 3.3.3-7)
I have many assembly-language routines that need to interface with
'C' code. The new 'C' compiler is doing something different than
gcc 3.2, previously used.
I need to know what general-purpose registers need to be saved
in the called procedure. Previously, one needed to save the
index registers only (%ebx, %edi, %esi). Apparently I need to
save others with the new compiler because, although the called
procedures work, subsequent 'C' code fails in strange ways.
Please, if somebody __knows__ (really knows), let me know. I
will have to edit over 200 assembly-language files and I want
to do it only once!  I don't want to just save all the registers
used because this wastes CPU cycles and the only reason for
the assembly in the first place was to save CPU cycles.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
