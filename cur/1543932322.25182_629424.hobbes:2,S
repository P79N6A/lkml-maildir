My real issue is that I need a kind of "kernel to kernel" communication
method. The var args is just a convenient way to pass an array of
unsigned longs between two kernels. The reason is as follow:
The kexec based hibernating process is as follow:
h1. put devices in quiescent state
h2. save devices/CPU state
h3. jump to kexeced kernel (kernel B)
*h4. normal kernel boot of kernel B
*h5. save devices/CPU state
*h6. jump back to original kernel (kernel A)
h7. restore devices/CPU state
h8. put devices in quiescent state
h9. put devices in low power state
h10. execute necessary ACPI method (prepare to sleep)
h11. save devices/CPU state
h12. jump to kernel B
*h13. execute necessary ACPI method (wake up)
*h14. restore devices/CPU state
*h15. put devices in normal power state
*h16. write memory image of kernel A into disk
*h17. put system into ACPI S4 state
The kexec based resuming process is as follow:
*r1. boot the resuming kernel (kernel C)
*r2. restore the memory image of kernel A
*r3. put devices in quiescent state
*r4. execute necessary ACPI method (prepare to resume)
*r5. jump to kernel A
r6. execute necessary ACPI method (wake up)
r7. restore devices/CPU state
Where, line begin with "*" is executed in kernel B and kernel C, others
are executed in kernel A.
The kernel A need to distinguish the difference between h7 and r6, while
the kernel B/C need to distinguish between *h13 and normal jump back.
The different kernel action need to be taken depends on the action of
peer kernel. Now, this is solved by kernel-kernel communication, a
command word is passed to peer kernel to inform the action required.
I remember you have said before that you think it is better to use only
"user space to user space" communication between kernel A and kernel B.
This is OK for normal kexec. But if the kexec jump is used for multiple
functions with early kernel action involved (normal kexec jump, kexec
jump to hibernate, kexec jump to resume), it is necessary to use "kernel
to kernel" communication.
The var args in the patch is just an array of unsigned longs, it can be
expresses as follow too.
int kexec_call(struct kimage *image, unsigned long *ret, unsigned int
argc, unsigned long argv[]);
The var args version is as follow.
int kexec_call(struct kimage *image, unsigned long *ret, unsigned int
argc, ...);
