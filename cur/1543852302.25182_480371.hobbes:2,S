Probably due to the fact it is a 64-bit counter.  Even with
a free running rate of 10Ghz it would take nearly 60 years
to wrap.
On PPC and ARM 32-bit counters seems to be common which limits
range unless a prescaler is available.  The better solution is
to detect wrap as a prescaled 32 bit measurement will eventually
run out of usable resolution as core frequency increases.  That is
assuming 64-bit counters don't eventually show up in these
architectures.
