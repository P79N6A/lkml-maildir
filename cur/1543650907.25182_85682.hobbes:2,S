   The problem is this would trivially break cross-compilation. Would it
   not be better to stick something in the glibc's bits/types.h
   per-platform ?
   
   Not that I particularly fancy going near glibc...
No, becuase this is an attribute of the cpu the binary
is executing on, not an attribute of the ABI under which
userland compilation are taking place.
At run time, you probe this /proc/sys/kernel/pointer_size
value.  In fact, this should have no effect whatsoever on
cross-compilation.  I thought we were quite clear on this
solution?
