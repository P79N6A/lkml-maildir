One thing I found very useful was to kmalloc msi_msg at MSI/MSI-X
enable time, and stick a pointer to it in the msi_desc structure,
not just for the CONFIG_PM case. For MSI, there's a single pointer
to track. This simplified a lot of code and allowed me to avoid
pci config reads to read the hardware at various places.

You wouldn't need this if you saved away the msi_msg values
returned from ->setup().
