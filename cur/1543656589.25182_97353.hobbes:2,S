Good thinking Alan! it seems ACPI is causing the trouble.
2.4.18 - OK
2.4.19 - OK
2.4.20 - OK
2.4.21-pre2 OK  (using pdc202xx_new driver)
2.5.52 with ACPI - Failure, IRQ troubles wrong IRQ assigned for promise
                   boards, lockup of box during boot
2.5.52 no ACPI   - OK !!!
What information do I need to provide to fix this problem?
Frank.
