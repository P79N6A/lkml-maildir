One more question if you don't mind. These are the only errors I have
left as boot. Are these not present in 2.5?
Setting hostname tiger:                              [  OK  ]
Initializing USB controller (usb-uhci):              [  OK  ]
Mounting USB filesystem:                             [  OK  ]
Initializing USB HID interface:                      [  OK  ]
Initializing USB Keyboard: FATAL: Module keybdev not found.
                                                     [ FAILED ]
Initializing USB Mouse: FATAL: Module mousedev not found.
                                                     [ FAILED ]
