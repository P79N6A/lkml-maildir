I'm seeing 17072 as a group-leader and the 'threads' as .17073 etc.
When you put all 'threads' into /proc/17072/threads, you'd get
/proc/17072/threads/17072, /proc/17072/threads/17073, etc.
/proc/17072 would show stats for the whole threads group, while
/proc/17072/threads/17072 would show stats for just that thread.

Yuck ;(

What is against /proc/<pid>/threads ?

That would also be solved with /proc/<pid> and /proc/<pid>/threads/<thread>

That would also be the case with /proc/<pid>/threads
