Subject: dm patchset to remove the v1 interface
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Please apply at least the first of these 2 patches before 2.6.0.  We
don't want to be commited to supporting the v1 interface for the
lifetime of 2.6.
Thanks,
