I wouldn't call it an hack, it is just a less advanced version of what
you did in 2.5, if that is an hack how do you call the 2.4 and 2.2 code?
You've the bitmap array too and you use the bitmap to allocate the pid.
The big difference is that the 2.4 patch isn't capable of using the
bitmap in a synchronized and uptodate manner, so it has to rebuild the
bitmap at every getpid, and it misses all the infrastructure you added to
avoid walking the tasklist in getpid and to dynamically allocate new
maps. That means exit() (and various not performance critical syscalls)
will be a bit slower in 2.5, but it should payoff for getpid that
doesn't need to walk the tasklist anymore, so I certainly agree the
patch I posted is useless for the latest 2.5.38. One nice bit of 2.5 is
that the test and set bit on the global bitmask fixes the race with two
tasks taking the same pid quite naturally, it wasn't fixable that way in
the 2.4 patch because the bitmap is local to the task and rebuild at
each getpid.
