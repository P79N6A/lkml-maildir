****Apologies if I have posted at the wrong mailing
list ***** 
Hi,
I need some help in understanding the impact of cpu
loading and 
multimedia characteristics. My current system is
Pentium4, HT, 1GB Ram; i am also using LInux 2.6.18.1
kernel (vanilla). For stressing the cpu, I am 
using interbench which run a loop using asm volatile
identifier and the multimedia player I am using is
mplayer.
Here are my steps:
1. Fire Interbench in the background. Using top I see
that the CPU 
utlization is 99.1%.
2. Fire mplayer with Interbench running.
Both of them have equal priority.
However, I am NOT seeing any impact of loading the cpu
on the performance of mplyaer (i.e no dropped frames,
lack of synchronization,...). 
How can I load the CPU such that the scheduling time
slice is insuffucent for mplayer to playout the video?
To the mplayer the system thus appears "slow" ?
Thanks,
IM
