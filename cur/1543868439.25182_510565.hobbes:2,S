These are all different functional ideas.
It is no response to an argument like this to say, "you could always express
a different idea". Copyright only protects the one way the author chose to
express an idea. You should not ever need to change an idea to get around
copyright.
I hate to sound like a broken record, but have you read Lexmark v. Static
Controls? There was a section where they talked about how perhaps you could
have used a different algorithm to measure the toner level.
You may have to change your idea to get around a patent, but you should
never, ever have to change a functional idea to get around a copyright.
Do you realize that you are arguing for software patents? And worse, for
patents that are easy to get (and last as long) as copyrights.
