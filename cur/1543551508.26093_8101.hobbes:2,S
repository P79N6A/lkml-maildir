But remember that "rss" counts in pages, so it's plenty for sparc32: only
32 bits of virtual address  that can count towards the rss.
And even on alpha, a 32-bit atomic_t means we cover 45 bits of virtual
address space, which, btw, is more than you can cram into the current
three-level page tables, I think.
