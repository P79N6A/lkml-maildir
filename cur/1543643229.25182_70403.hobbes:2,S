Not true. A sudden surge in legitmate traffic can stretch the limits
unwittingly or a new legitmate appliation can stretch the limits in an
unexpected way. If there is such a surge, who has priority?
I have cause similar random behaviour 1) if I have a lot users doing little
things, 2) a few big users doing big things, 3) a  mix of users doing
various things or 4) one  users doing bad things. And in any of the cases,
I have no say in whose going to get killed.
And I don't have to try very hard and I don't have to be the super user.
