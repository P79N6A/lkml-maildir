It has been ages now, but my impression when I wrote the patch that
current cores still had a few outstanding errata with using the
extended pat bits.
Further it was my impression was that if we just changed UC- to WC
we work on essentially everything, because PAT is always enabled
on the cores that support it.
Therefore since we only have 3 interesting caching modes.
WB, WC, UC.  We should be very careful about reprogramming it
and we can ignore the errors.
As for the pat class errata about inconsistent mappings those are
reoccurring issues, that happen across all cpu types (x86/ppc/fred),
and every  major core overhaul is likely to have them again.
