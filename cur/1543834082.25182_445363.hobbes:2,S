Yes, I just ran the test with 2.6.17.6.  With CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK=y
the test fails and the soft lockup situation often results.
However, when built with CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK=n, the test passes,
and runs rather quickly in comparison to when it fails.
I've attached a slightly updated version of the test case.
It is a little more carefully crafted and prints some
output so that you have some idea that it is working.
