Definitely.  I already use home-grown scripts to maintain multiple
object-trees, with the sources symlinked to a single source tree,
because I generally maintain several different platforms simultaneously.
Having one source tree makes things _much_ easier, as I don't have to
keep track of changes in a bunch of separate trees (it also saves a bit
of space, which is nice)!
