i very much doubt there are hard and fast rules about this.  the informal
heuristics i can see for getting patches into Linus' kernel:
 - if it fixes a bug, it probably goes in if it fixes the bug in
   an acceptable way and isn't uglier than living with the bug.
 - if it does not affect the core code in any way and it's completely
   independent, it goes in
 - if it's a complete rewrite of a major subsystem, it's early in
   a development cycle and Linus likes it, it goes in.
 - if it makes the code cleaner, it might go in if Linus thinks it's
   safe.
 - if it makes the core code uglier, it probably won't go in.  (many
   patches from commercial companies fall into this category.)
 - if it stands a chance of destabilising the whole system late in an alleged
   code freeze, it probably won't go in.
