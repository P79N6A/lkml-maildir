Dear Brent,
   An alternative solution:
   Assuming web traffic
   Assuming each provider has a web proxy server
1. Make sure traffic to each provider uses their
particular link (traceroute).
2. Configure a "squid" proxy server with two
parents, one at each provider.
3. Set up your local web browsers to use your
proxy server.
I suspect the official way may involve routing
with BGP(?), and I doubt if your ISP's will
allow that.
Please keep me informed because I'll be
treading down this path when DSL comes to the UK.
