It never hurts to point out the obvious in case someone didn't notice,
so long as one doesn't become repetitive.

Pity. What about virtualization? Surely one of these 16+ CPU machines
with petabytes of disk storage can spare one CPU for an hour for a
virtual machine, just set it with like a 3 GB hard drive image (which
is later deleted), 1 GB swap (ditto), 128 MB memory, and one CPU
instance -- then test with vanilla and the patches in question? (My
understanding is that one of the major "fun things" that these kinds
of machines have is that they come with interesting VM features and
instruction sets.)

Has anyone tested it on one of these massive multi-core "beasts" and
seen if it DOES degrade performance? I want to see numbers. Since the
performance improvements for these machines are based on numbers, I
want to see any argument for degradation also in numbers. Both
absolute numbers and relative numbers.
(Obviously, since -ck doesn't target that kind of thing, it's not
possible at the moment to prove how useful -ck is with numbers. But
surely we can measure how much of a "negative" impact it does have on
everything else. If it isn't hurting anyone, then what's wrong with
it?)
Unfortunately, the argument that "xyz" is just as bad/worse is hardly
useful from what I've seen in kernel talks... maybe we're missing
something here.
Is it possible to command a program's memory usage be put into swap on
purpose, without "forcing" it into swap by taking other memory? (Maybe
such a feature could be used to time how long it takes to restore from
swap by timing how long the first or second display update takes on
some typically-used GUI program that takes a while to draw its GUI.)
Just a couple of additional thoughts.

P.S. For anyone who cares and is sending replies to my messages, I am
subscribed to the ck ML, but not linux-kernel. So if you want me to
see it and it's in the latter, CC me.
