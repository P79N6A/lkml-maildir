I'd like to release resoures al well (interrupts only really, as ports are
always reserved by the system even before PNP is initialized).

While PCI devices can be very flexible i8042 is extremely rigid. Its
resources are pretty much fixed and will not move. Its IO port region
is reserved by the kernel right off the bat and is not available to anyone
including PNP subsystem to ensure that nothing will touch it or bad
things might happen.

I think you need to make an effort to make a PCI device use IRQ12
but the idea is that if you don't have a mouse attached (but you do
have i8042) and you are short on free interrupts and your HW can
use IRQ12 for some other stuff let it have it. That is the reqson why
i8042 requests IRQ only when corresponding port is open. No mouse -
IRQ is free.

Well it is not needed one i8042 has been initialized at all so why
keep it? Even if it saves 1K it is good enough.
