Ah, right... sata_nv.c of course interacts with the outside world, d'oh!
Up to now, I only got bad kernels, latest tested being:
94fcda1f8ab5e0cacc381c5ca1cc9aa6ad523576
Which, unless I missed a commit in the diff, only USB changes,
continuing anyway.
Just to make sure, here's my little helper for this bisect run, I hope
it does what you expected:
#!/bin/bash
cp ../sata_nv.c.orig drivers/ata/sata_nv.c
git bisect good
cp drivers/ata/sata_nv.c ../sata_nv.c.orig
cp ../sata_nv.c drivers/ata/
make oldconfig
make -j4
Where "../sata_nv.c" is the version from 2.6.20-rc5. The copying is done
to avoid conflicts and keep git happy. Of course there's also a version
for bad kernels ;) No idea, why I didn't make that an argument to the
script...
Thanks,
Björn
