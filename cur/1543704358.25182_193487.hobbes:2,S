Hi,
I have read the FAQ and have searched heartily for anything which I 
could understand about this, but have come up empty. I am replacing a 
Unixware 7.1.1 server (not a unixware question) with RH ES3. The server 
hosts a BASIC application so users log in via ssh sessions. The problem 
is I am getting to around 120 users and then getting a no pseudo ttys 
available. RH support had me bump up the number of instances in 
xinetd.conf which did nothing. Then a person we use for Unix support 
said that the type of pseudo ttys that we use is wrong. His example:
when I log in over ssh I get /dev/pts/0 when I type tty. But he says it 
should be of type /dev/ptsp* I know (suspect strongly) that this is 
configured in the kernel but not where. Can anyone please post a little 
information for me regarding this.
I heartily welcome your assistance in smiting this unixware servers job.
