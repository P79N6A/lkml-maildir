Subject: [PATCH] Fix 100% initramfs bloat in 2.6.17 versus 2.6.16
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

When I built 2.6.17 for the first time I was a little surprised to see
my kernel putting on >500Kb in weight.
It didn't take long to work out that this was because my initramfs's
contents were being included twice in the cpio image.
A make V=1 makes the problem obvious:
/bin/sh /usr/packages/linux/versions/i686-loki/scripts/gen_initramfs_list.sh -l  "usr/initramfs" > usr/.initramfs_data.cpio.gz.d
  /bin/sh /usr/packages/linux/versions/i686-loki/scripts/gen_initramfs_list.sh -o usr/initramfs_data.cpio.gz  -u 0  -g 0  "usr/initramfs"  "usr/initramfs"
Note that doubling-up of the "usr/initramfs", which leads to
gen_initramfs_list.sh dumping the thing into the cpio archive twice.
The cause is an obvious pasto, fixed thusly:
