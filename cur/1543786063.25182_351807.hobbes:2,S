I was totally overlooking the page_table_lock during the fork.
But no matter, it's not good enough: src_mm->page_table_lock is acquired
and dropped at the inner level, in copy_pte_range (looking at latest 2.6):
it cannot be held across allocating page tables for dst_mm.
So each time T1 drops it, there's a window for the T2 vs. T3 problem.
Yet we don't much want to flush TLB each time we leave copy_pte_range.
