Umm ... where to begin.
1. No, DOS didn't do it better - DOS devices were mostly a bad copy of  
Xenix devices.
2. DOS definitely didn't do it better for serial ports. Serial ports are  
the single most broken devices that DOS supports by default, so much so  
that literally *no* serious program that needed the serial ports used the  
built-in driver. Only toy programs did that. Because those drivers weren't  
anything but toys themselves.
I know this the hard way. I used serial ports under DOS for something like  
ten years.
