Then it is one of these:
- gmail's default settings for web input sucks or
- the web browser reformats it
  (not so much - pastebin.ca suffers from something similar, but *not the
  same*; in that it translates all tabs into spaces, but at least it keeps
  the width.) or
- you are using your own client, and directly SMTPing gmail servers,
  in which case unwanted reformatting by broken MTAs can be bypassed.

Hm, this looks like another of these "Thunderbird" cases. (Means,
Thunderbird users also get their patches wrapped and twangled unless
they set some option that is not on by default.)
