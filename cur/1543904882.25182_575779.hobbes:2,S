It's certainly true WRT things like indentation but IMHO it shouldn't
go that far, and if it goes, it should be non-braced version.
If we prefer non-braced versions of "if" and "while", it would be
a bit strange to require braces with "do while", wouldn't it?
Sparse warnings... I think it shouldn't complain either, unless
called with extra parameter.
Perhaps some pointer to a bad-looking example so I can see for myself?
