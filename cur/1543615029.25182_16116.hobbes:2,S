My understanding is that the problem is something to do with the
Toshiba Tecra laptops not flushing the cache properly when activating
the A20 line.  This causes a problem for bzImage kernels because they
decompress into extended memory, whereas zImage kernels don't and
thus don't tickle the bug.
Unfortunately, I haven't seen a proper technical description of the problem
nor any workaround or patch.
Earlier versions of Debian Linux e.g. 2.1 (the distro that I use) used to 
supply
special "Tecra" kernels because of this problem.

This sounds about right, but I've not been able to locate the info on Intel's
website.
