Are you _really_ missing basic know how to understand that fsck is using the
block layer of a virtual "block device" emulated by UNIX while libscg is
offering _direct_ acces to _any_ type of device allowing you to send _commands_
understood by the device?
fsck is just sending abstract instructions to a virtual device and does 
not care about 
Please explain me:
-	how to use /dev/hd* in order to scan an image from a scanner
-	how to use /dev/hd* in order to talk to a CPU device
-	how to use /dev/hd* in order to talk to a tape device
-	how to use /dev/hd* in order to talk to a printer
-	how to use /dev/hd* in order to talk to a jukebox
-	how to use /dev/hd* in order to talk to a graphical device
