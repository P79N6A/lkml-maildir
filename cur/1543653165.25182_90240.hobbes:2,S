Not really.  Correct fix is:
	a) in fs/block_dev.c::full_check_disk_change() replace
	if (check_disk_change(bdev)) {
with
	if (check_disk_change(bdev) && bdev->bd_invalidated) {
	b) lost the check in rescan_partitions().
Other callers either do that check themselves or don't want that check to
happen at all (BLKRRPART).
