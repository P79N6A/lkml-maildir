The big problem with TCQ is that it only works with some versions of
some conrollers and oopses on others. At the moment the TCQ support isnt
integrated into drivera that override some ide dma ops and there is no
mechanism Jens included for a controller to indicate no-tcq.
Pre-empt is another matter. IDE locking is rather hosed, pre-empt is
showing up existing and long standing problems I think. I've been
commenting bits of ide about locking ready to attempt to actually fix
the locking once the more pressing problems are solved
