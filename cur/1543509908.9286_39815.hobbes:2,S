I've got your idea.  But _all_ real systems are oversubscribed.
There are 15 users on my working system.  Each of them is allowed to spawn
256 processes.  Each process is allowed to consume up to 128M memory.
The total amount of memory is 128M too.  So my system is 384000%
oversubscribed.  That's how I have always been managing my system and want to
manage it in the future.  That's how 99.9% administrators do.
The proposed system of per-user resource accounting reduces the risk of crash
to an acceptable value.  Nothing less is acceptable, nothing more is
necessary.

For me 10% of performance degradation without a good reason is unacceptable
independently of the system size.
