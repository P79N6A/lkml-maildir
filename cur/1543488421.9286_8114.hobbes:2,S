Mach is not just another port - it requires extensive non arch/* changes to 
replace things like timers, the scheduler etc. and replace them with Mach
calls. Such alternative code is hard to maintain and tends to break
with every single change. So maintaining such a "port" is a lot more
work than just another port to some new hardware. I also don't see the
point now that monolithic Linux exists, or will soon (PA-RISC), for 
all architectures supported by OSF/Mach.
