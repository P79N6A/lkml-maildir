This patch set adds the PPS support into Linux.
PPS means "pulse per second" and its API is specified by RFC 2783
(Pulse-Per-Second API for UNIX-like Operating Systems, Version 1.0).
The code has been tested with the NTPD program
(
http://www.eecis.udel.edu/~mills/ntp/html/index.html
) and several GPS
antennae.
