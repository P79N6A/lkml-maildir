Yes, that's the whole point. If you want to have some kind of per-ip / 
per-network accounting, I'd rather recommend using something else
(i.e. an accounting module attaching to the netfilter hook itself,
something using the ULOG target to do the logging in userspace, ...)
Just reading out the per-rule counters always introduces problems as soon
as your ruleset changes. And when do you have a really static ruleset?
There are always new services/... to configure.

so what about iptables-save at shutdown time and iptables-restore at 
bootup time? Then you can have your counters persist even after kernel
upgrades / reboots / crashes / ...

Yes, because it is per network device, not per some arbitrarily inserted
rule which can be changed all the time. As I've stated more than once
in this thread, and as you just continue to say: just delete and re-insert
the rule, and you have your counter reset.

I don't think that the iptables kernel part should remove some feature
just because there are application programmers wrongly designing their
applications.
