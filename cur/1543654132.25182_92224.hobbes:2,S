Absolutely.  But I didn't want to mess with your headers.

Oh, so I didn't explain the "clever" part of my clever plan?  Oops.

0.7 scans all the files (since it has no modules.dep and needs the
dependencies anyway).  0.8 reintroduces modules.dep (thanks Adam!)
which is where the alias info logically belongs ("stuff extracted from
modules").  Or maybe a separate file (implementation handwave).

Well, you could, by sucking out the aliases which start with "usb:"
(the post-processing just turns the tables into aliases, doesn't
delete them or anything).  You could also use the old-fashioned way
and suck it from the tables directly, but then you're back in
"intimate knowledge of kernel internals" land.
Cheers,
Rusty.
