Hi,
I'm just testing your IdleC1Halt patch (didn't reboot yet) with 2.6.4, but 
there is a problem if apm is enabled in the configuration: 
arch/i386/kernel/built-in.o(.text+0x10b65): In function `apm_cpu_idle':
: undefined reference to `default_idle'
Your patch sets default_idle() static, so its not available in apm.c file. 
Usually I compile with acpi and apm support to switch between both in case of 
an unsual problem, and I think many people also do so.
