Ahh.. I think the point of the dual-license is that there is a lot of
non linux-specific Infiniband code that will (hopefully) be usefull on
other platforms where a BSD license might be more usefull. If for some
reason I decided I wanted to run MacOSX, I would at least want to be
running the OpenIB infiniband stack, and not some proprietary module.
Does anyone have some nice scripts to audit for useage of
EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL only functions? Maybe it's worth trying to clean up
the code to clearly deliniate what depends on GPL functions and what
doesn't.
