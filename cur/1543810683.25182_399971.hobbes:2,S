I'm not adverse to making the gdt descriptors part of the per-cpu data.  
But I think your patch is missing some necessary changes to 
include/asm-i386/desc.h - what do you plan to do with the following 
definition there?
extern struct Xgt_desc_struct idt_descr, cpu_gdt_descr[NR_CPUS];
Also, it seems likely you may have broken APM and/or PnP BIOS.

Can't you get rid of this ugly hack _and_ optimize the code at the same 
time?  I don't understand the details of voyager bringup, but it seems 
clear that the BSP or node 0 is special in both sub-architectures.  If 
it is special anyway, the conditional logic can be merged, and better 
yet, the allocation for the first caller of cpu_init() can skip the 
allocation entirely - it can simply use the boot GDT, which is already 
page-aligned and ready to go.  This gets rid of the 
alloc_bootmem_pages() piece of the hack above.
Also, it seems you left the allocation of the GDT in do_boot_cpu().  How 
do you plan to make sure that GDT allocation is compatible with hotplug 
CPU startup?  I was worried about that, which is why I moved the GDT 
allocation for secondary processors (originally in 
arch/i386/kernel/cpu/common.c) to smpboot.c.
