Careful.  The following is really quite a bit better on Alpha:
static inline int
sched_find_first_zero_bit(unsigned long *bitmap)
{
        unsigned long b0 = bitmap[0];
        unsigned long b1 = bitmap[1];
        unsigned long b2 = bitmap[2];
        unsigned long ofs = MAX_RT_PRIO;
        if (unlikely(~(b0 & b1) != 0)) {
                b2 = (~b0 == 0 ? b0 : b1);
                ofs = (~b0 == 0 ? 0 : 64);
        }
        return ffz(b2) + ofs;
}
It compiles down to 
        ldq $2,0($16)
        ldq $3,8($16)
        lda $5,128($31)
        ldq $0,16($16)
        and $2,$3,$1
        ornot $31,$2,$4
        ornot $31,$1,$1
        bne $1,$L8
$L2:
        ornot $31,$0,$0
        cttz $0,$0
        addl $0,$5,$0
        ret $31,($26),1
$L8:
        mov $2,$0
        cmpult $31,$4,$5
        cmovne $4,$3,$0
        sll $5,6,$5
        br $31,$L2
which is a fair bit better than find_first_zero_bit if for
no other reason than we collect all the memory accesses
right up at the beginning.
While we're on the subject of sched_find_first_zero_bit, I'd 
like to complain about Ingo's choice of header file.  Why in
the world did you choose mmu_context.h?  Invent a new asm/sched.h
if you must, but please don't choose headers at random.
