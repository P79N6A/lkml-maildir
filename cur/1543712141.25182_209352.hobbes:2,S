Subject: [PATCH 13/22] /dev/random: kill extract_timer_state
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

/dev/random  kill extract_timer_state
Remove unused extract_timer_state struct. It was formerly used to
feedback zero-entropy timing samples while extracting entropy, but
that had a tendency to overwhelm the batch processing queue and
prevent storing real samples.
