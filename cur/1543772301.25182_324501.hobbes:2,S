+static inline unsigned char
+___ia64_readb (const volatile void __iomem *addr)
+{
+    unsigned char val;
+
+    val = *(volatile unsigned char __force *)addr;
+    ia64_poison_check(val);
+

+}
Assigning value from addr to variable val stands for "ld", is it right?
What I want to do here is making sure that ld actually finishs loading data
from memory or mmaped register or far place to general register, and make
sure that the data is healthy enough to operate, not poisoned.

Umm, I think I need something like ia64_setreg(ANYWHERE_DUMMY_REG, val).
How do you think?
Or don't you mind if I move the definition of ia64_poison_check above to
gcc_intrin.h?
