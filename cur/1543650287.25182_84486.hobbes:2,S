Hello,
Since I've started to test the 2.5 series, I've noticed that 8250_cs doesn't 
really work - it doesn't detect my pcmcia card (psion global gold card).
I had a patch for 2.5.40 from Russell King that fixed it, but I can't get it 
to apply to 2.5.44, and well - out of the box it still doesn't work.
Is there any plan to get that fix in the kernel?
Thanks!
DK
