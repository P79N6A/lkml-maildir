Incorrect.  In some circumstances, they may be created by architecture
support code, and might be created and destroyed dynamically by
architecture support code.

Incorrect summary.  The ALSA use model of the driver model doesn't fit
with the driver model use model.  It's not that we're not interested
in it - it's that it's perverted to the way driver model folk intend
the subsystem to work, and the way that platform devices are used on
some architectures.
