This dependency is incorrect. It's only one or two chip-specific drivers
which require that the architecture correctly handle alignment traps,
and even then it's only actually apparent when used with JFFS2 which
actually _gives_ it an unaligned buffer occasionally. Everything else
works fine.
Also, I don't want to see this dependency expressed in the MTD Kconfig
file unless it's not arch-specific. Please make a generic
BROKEN_UNALIGNED config option, and set it on all architectures which
need it. Then propose a saner place to put the restriction instead of on
CONFIG_MTD.
