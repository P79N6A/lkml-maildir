This is a bug in how these includes are structured.  It may be ok to leave
the damn
thing the way it is, but warn folks who build custom drivers (like the SCI
drivers I
maintain for Dolphin, NWFS, etc.) that their f_cking code will be broken and
generate these garbage errors if they have not run make dep against the tree
they
try to build against.
I would not have expected you or most LKML folks to have seen this, since
you live
in a world where everything is in the kernel tree.   I am telling you there
is a problem there,
and it can bite.  After I build this module (since the generated code thatr
ends up in
the external module is crap) it will routinely crash over and over gain
until it gets rebuilt
against a kernel that has had make dep (and make bzImage) run against it.
