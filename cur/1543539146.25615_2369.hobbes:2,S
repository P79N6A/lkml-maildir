That patch is 100% correct. That patches fixed palette setting problems.
On most video hardware how the palette is set depends on the video
mode. Thus you have to set the palette after the video mode is set. The
video mode can be altered in con_switch. Please if anyone has problems let
me know what hardware is doing this and what you are running. It is a
correct patch but it could be that XFree86 either takes advantage of the
kernel bug or XFree86 doesn't reset the hardware back to the correct state
after switching to the console. Which happens alot :-(.
