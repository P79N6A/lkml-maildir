Subject: can't mount root fs (2.3.19)

Hi,
I am currently running kernel version 2.2.12 without major
problems. When I try to boot kernel 2.3.19, it always stops with
the message "unable to mount root fs on 03:06". I can't think of
any reason why this is happening: the partitions are listed
correctly in the partition check, partition 03:06 ("/dev/hda6")
contains the root filesystem, the ext2 driver is compiled into
the kernel ...
I looked around in the documentation and particularly in the
kernel configuration options but I can't spot any change from
2.2.12 that would explain this problem. Did I overlook something?
I obviously did, but what? Anybody has a clue?
regards,
             Peter
