About half of the ioctls that need special care have fixed numbers 
instead of using _IOR() etc, see e.g. include/linux/sockios.h,
or they get the definition wrong in some way.
The way you do it in your patch could work for many cases, but it
won't be enough to eliminate HANDLE_IOCTL(), if that is desired.
Adding fops->compat_ioctl() makes it possible to eventually replace 
all HANDLE_IOCTL() and keep only COMPATIBLE_IOCTL(), which in turn
would become simpler to deal with.
If we don't add fops->compat_ioctl(), the ioctl handlers could
however look at (current_thread_info()->flags & _TIF_32BIT) to find
out if which user data structure they should expect. Is that reliable?
Do we already have a macro to do it?
