And this only covers the special case of subnet exports, not NIS group
exports, dns domain wildcard exports, ..... Adding all these to the kernel
is not possible (and not desirable). Matching the traditional Unix kernel
design rule of providing "mechanism not policy" I think it is best to add
some call back mechanism, where the kernel can ask user space to 
reauthenticate before refusing a file handle. mountd could handle this
too, e.g. via a netlink socket. 
Doing it in the kernel is the wrong way IMHO.
