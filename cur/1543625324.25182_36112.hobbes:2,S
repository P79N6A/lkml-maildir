Never. Not when it's in X except when I logout.

Never did after I saw the problem. And tried both noapic and disabling the
kernel option for IO-APIC and local APIC.

Can't remember if it's a module, I kind of doubt it but it might be, I use
a LOT of modules.

Since I see this on lots of Dells I suspect a hardware issue. I may try a
FB version of X, but mainly I plan to get something else less broken
unless I can find a fix. Pity, the machine is really nice otherwise, other
than the WinModem it uses.
