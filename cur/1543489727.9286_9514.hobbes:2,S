All...
	I just noticed a peculiar effect while building some bootable
images for some CD's.  I have the boot image mounted over the loopback
file system and copy some files to the image and unmount the image.
I noticed that the modification time on the boot image was not changed
even though the file was!
	Example:
] chaos:/u/cdrom/build# ls -l boot.cd 
] -r--r--r--   1 root     root      2949120 Mar 12 13:26 boot.cd
] chaos:/u/cdrom/build# sum boot.cd 
] 61897  2880
] chaos:/u/cdrom/build# mount boot.cd /mnt/cdrom -t msdos -o loop=/dev/loop1
] chaos:/u/cdrom/build# gzip -9 < initrd.img > /mnt/cdrom/initrd.img
] chaos:/u/cdrom/build# umount /mnt/cdrom/
] chaos:/u/cdrom/build# sum boot.cd 
] 28152  2880
] chaos:/u/cdrom/build# ls -l boot.cd 
] -r--r--r--   1 root     root      2949120 Mar 12 13:26 boot.cd
	Shouldn't the timestamp have been updated?
	I'm running Linux 2.2.3, no ac or pre patches.
	Mike
