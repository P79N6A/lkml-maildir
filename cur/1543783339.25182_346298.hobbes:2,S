Have you updated the firmware on the USB enclosure?  I have one using
the Prolific chipset for both USB/Firewire and it was crappy until I
upgraded the firmware on there.  It made all the difference.  
Also, can you use this USB enclosure on Windows or another computer?
And which kernel version are you running?  It's not clear if your on
2.6.13-mm1 or some other version.  
More details would be good too, such as:
	lsusb
	cat /proc/version
What happens if you unplug the drive when the system hangs?  Does it
recover?  And try powering up the enclosure without it being hooked to
anything, then once 30 seconds have passed, hook it upto the Linux box
and see what happens then.  Maybe the power on stuff is doing strange
things.
