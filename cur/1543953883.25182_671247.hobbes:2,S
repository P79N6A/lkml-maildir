Disagreement between checkpatch and maintainers preferred style.  I've
had a patch that fixed a bug and - while in the region - "cleaned up"
the style for a single line.  This line no longer matches the rest of
the file and creates the kind of visual distraction you complain about.
In short, for a file with an active maintainer whatever the maintainer
prefers should be done.  Doing a full checkpatch sweep against a
maintainers wishes is madness, doing a partial "cleanup" is worse.
Of course when a maintainer likes checkpatch, as you do, there is no
disagreement to deal with. :)
