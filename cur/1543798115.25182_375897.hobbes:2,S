Hmm, I'm not sure it is that useful. Did someone decide to move
all information from cpuinfo into sysfs? 
And if it's done I think it needs Documentation somewhere.
Anyways, the notifier is wrong. You need to handle CPU_UP_CANCELLED
too.
And you could probably shrink the code size of the show function
in half by switching data instead of functions.
