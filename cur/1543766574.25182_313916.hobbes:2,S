Yes, absolutely!
The memory buffer is allocated by the process (usually just via malloc) and 
registed/pinned by the driver.  It then stays pinned for the life of the process (typically).

That's just how RMDA works.  Once the memory is pinned, if the app wants to send data to 
another node, it does two things:
1) Puts the data into its buffer
2) Sends a "work request" to the driver with (among other things) the offset and length of 
the data.
This is a time-critical operation.  It must occurs as fast as possible, which means the 
memory must have already been pinned.
