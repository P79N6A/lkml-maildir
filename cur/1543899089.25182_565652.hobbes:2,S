    I really like the spirit of CMake. Of course, it adds a dependency,
but IMHO is much safer to depend on CMake being installed (or Perl, for
that matter) than to depend on a shell. Every shell out there seems to
do things on its own, and apart from dash, which is more or less
standard, the rest of shells do actually violate the standard one way or
another (in fact, configure script include workarounds for at least Bash
and Zsh).

    Well, that's nothing that a good editor can't solve. You can
configure VIM to lowercase your CMakelist while you edit, and uppercase
it afterwards. And yes, I also thing that's a bad idea and eyes hurt
badly when reading uppercase. Maybe it's not too late to change it ;)
