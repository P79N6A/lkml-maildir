I am stupid. Yes, flush_workqueue() is evil and should not be used, but
if we use workqueues, tasklet_disable() becomes might_sleep() anyway.
This is incompatible and unavoidable change.
grep, grep...
	net/bluetooth/hci_core.c:hci_rx_task()
		read_lock(&hci_task_lock)
		hci_event_packet()
			hci_num_comp_pkts_evt()
				tasklet_disable(&hdev->tx_task)
