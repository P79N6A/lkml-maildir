Okay, I'm running my usenet exchange machines on Linux with Earthquake,
one thread per socket, 300-500 sockets, 700-800GB/day with incoming rate
spikes to 130Mbit on two 100Mbit NICs. What is it I'm supposed to try
doing with threads?
And if this is a webserver or anything like it, the incoming bandwidth is
probably orders of magnitude below the outgoing... Hum, like a usenet
reader server. Below, from a Linux box running Twister, also threaded per
feed in and per reader socket out.
