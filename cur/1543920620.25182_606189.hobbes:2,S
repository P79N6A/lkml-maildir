thanks, applied.
note that current -git has a whole bunch of new schedstats fields in 
/proc/<PID>/sched which can be used to track the exact balancing 
behavior of tasks. It can be cleared via echoing 0 to the file - so 
overflow is not an issue. Most of those new fields should probably be 
unsigned int too. (they are u64 right now.)
