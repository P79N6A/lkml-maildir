I have got a bad feeling about upcoming deadlock problems when looking at 
the mutex_lock / unlock code in cpuup_callback in slab.c. Branches 
that just obtain a lock or release a lock? I hope there is some 
control of  what happens between lock acquisition and release?
You are aware that this lock is taken for cache shrinking/destroy, tuning 
of cpu cache sizes, proc output and cache creation? Any of those run on 
the same processor should cause a deadlock.
