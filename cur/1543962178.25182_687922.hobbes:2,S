Would you mind replacing also the first sentence by something which 
indicates whether this option alone already changes the kernel build?
Look at the help texts of other menuconfig option items.  Random pick: 
NETDEV_1000:
	[...]
	Say Y here to get to see options for Gigabit Ethernet drivers.
	This option alone does not add any kernel code.
	[...]
	If you say N, all options in this submenu will be skipped and
	disabled.
