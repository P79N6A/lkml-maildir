This is all correct, and also note that W/9x systems do not support the
"*SMBSERVER" name.
On the other hand, the name was resolved somehow.  The typical work-arounds
to not knowning the NBT name of the server are:
1) Use the name you just resolved (in this case, "CL0").
2) Send a Node Status Query and look for the first unique <20> name.
The second (as Steve explained to me a long time ago) is less reliable
because there are some applications out there which (incorrectly) register
names with a suffix byte of <20>.
