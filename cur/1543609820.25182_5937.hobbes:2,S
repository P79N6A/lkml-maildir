Actually it does affect it. Recompiling glibc isn't the end all to LFS
support. In fact, 2.1.3 has less than adequate support for LFS, IIRC, so
use 2.2.x. For Debian, that just means upgrading to woody(testing).
Your problem extends from programs also needing to be recompiled with
LFS support. This involves some special LFS CFLAGS, and most common
programs detect whether to do this using autoconf (fileutils, gzip and
tar are perfect examples of programs that use this feature).
