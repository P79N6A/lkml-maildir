The "keyboard changes" by alan in 2.4.21-pre5 seem to cause Alt-Lock
and Ctrl-Lock feature in X. (The workaround that ignores duplicate key
release events.)
What do do:
1) press and hold alt
2) press and release altgr
3) release alt
=> Now alt is locked down, pressing and releasing alt releases the lock.
Also xev doesn't show the release event for the alt. The same happens
with left ctrl + right ctrl => ctrl locked. 
I just commented out the workaround there and now it works as it used
to.
