Sound seems to be broken in latest kernel.
I use RedHat 5.2 with kde. With kmidi the midi files work correctly.
If I use the plugins under Netscape 4.08 or 4.5 (both 128 bits encription
using libc5) the midi sounds play real fast, sounds like shit.
My sound card is a ESS1869
Here is a site that you can test this bug

It works good with kernel 2.0.36
