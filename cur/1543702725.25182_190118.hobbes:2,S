Thanks for your answer, I use LILO but that root is refering to
presisely the root partition, in my case it its /dev/hda5...
It is well configured in lilo, I can enter with kernel 2.4... but not
with 2.6...
if you want to know, the exact Kernel error at the begining is:
VFS: Cannot open root device "305" or hda5
Please append a correct "root=" boot option
Kernel panic: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on hda5
but I know hda5 is the partition, maybe there has something to be with
the fact that the root partition is logical, in the extended partiton...
I mean is not a primary partition... could this be true???
