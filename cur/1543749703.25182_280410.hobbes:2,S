Presumably those tokens included "Oops" somewhere near the top and
function names. The Cyrix stuff is notoriously hard to keep cool so that
may be a good thing to check, as well as running memtest86+ to check the
RAM.
Also some very early stepping 6x86 Cyrixes simply don't run Linux
reliably and it seemed to be cache problems in the CPU.
