There should be no relevant pagetable scanning during those tests, and
the few bits that can get unmapped have lots of time to get mapped in
again from the cache with a minor fault, IMHO there's no way such tlb
flush removal can make a difference in a DBMS workload on a sanely setup
machine, I'm amazed you think it can make a difference.
