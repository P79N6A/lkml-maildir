Khm-khm, if we will always wait untill everyone will comment the code or
even initial
design, then nothing will be created at all.
Btw, where was comments about w1, kernel connector and acrypto? 
They were presented several times in lkml and all are completely new
subsystems.
Should I stop developing just because I did not get comments?
Above discussion was not borned because it is new subsystem, btw...
Ok, I want to thank everyone for discussion.
I believe that new subsystem must be discussed in specific mail lists
before
it goes mainstream, but not necessarily in lkml.
But if it really changes a lot of things, then of course it should be
presented 
in lkml.
Thank you.
