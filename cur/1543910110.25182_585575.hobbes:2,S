It was my first attempt (except I didn't have a per-cpu flag, but a per-task
flag), it's not visible but I love simplicity... ;-)
A KVM VCPU is stopped by preemption, so when we enter in scheduler we have
exited from VCPU and thus this flags is off (so we account 0 to the guest). What
I did then is "set the flag on when we enter in the VCPU, and
"account_system_time()" sets the flag off when it adds this timeslice to cpustat
(and compute correctly guest, user, system time). But I didn't like this idea
because all code executed after we entered in the VCPU is accounted to the guest
until we have an account_system_time() and I suppose we can have real system
time in this part. And I guess a VCPU can be less than 1 ms (unit of cputime) in
a timeslice.
So ? What's best ?
