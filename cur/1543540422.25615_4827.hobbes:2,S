A tricky one I've been playing around with:
Toshiba docking station PCI-PCI bridge (Vendor id=1179. Device id=0609)
It works but the range registers (IO limit & base,  Memory limit & base)
always return 0 on read.  Other than that it seems to function.
However it sure confuses the 2.4 kernel!  The only way I can see to deal
with this is to try and infer the values from those ranges assigned to
other devices.  But at the moment I'm using a gross hack.
