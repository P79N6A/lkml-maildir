Please, no conjectures but facts.
What are the kernel boot messages? (dmesg | grep hd)
What does hdparm -i say?

Probably you forgot to read the man page and did not
give the -z option.

Of course. fdisk will tell you what the kernel says
about disk geometry, but it does not change the
kernel's opinions.
If you want to force something upon the kernel, give
kernel boot parameters, or write something in the
/proc/ide/.../settings fields.
Read the Large Disk HOWTO.
(But with 2.2.14 things should work correctly by default -
I do not recall problems, that is, not unless you use
a disk manager.)

[P.S. In case you reply, also give the kernel version
very precisely. For example, 2.2.14 and 2.2.14-SuSE
are very different animals.]
