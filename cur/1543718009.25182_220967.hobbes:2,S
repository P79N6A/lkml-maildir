I was thinking just putting it in the existing wrapper sections.
We already have wrappers for pm_register, pm_unregister, 
pm_unregister_all, pm_send, pm_send_all, etc etc, and this would seem to 
be just one more case like that.
The alternative is to just always have "power_state" in the "dev_pm_info", 
especially as some versions of gcc have had bugs with empty structures 
anyway.
