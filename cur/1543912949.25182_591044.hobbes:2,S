Didn't know you used RPM yourself, so I guess this is just
a case of something slipping through rather than the spec file
needing a maintainer.  Having said that, it seems odd that you
would say the spec file included with git is "contrib status
already".   How can something be contrib status unless it
is in the contrib directory of Git?

Given the comment from David, I suspect your patch is all
that's needed; hopefully Peter can give it a quick test.
