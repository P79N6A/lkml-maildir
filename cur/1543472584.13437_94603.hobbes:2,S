Well, even if the Patent Office would hate Open Source for pulling 
against software patents, I'm against them. And I suggest it 
(hardware/software) as a line to draw in the admittedly shifting 
( FPGA/PLD/self-re-microcoding-CPU) sand.
(But as a minor point, I think the US Patent Office feels it's
credibility eroding, and might be happy to lose software issues. 
But whatever.)
