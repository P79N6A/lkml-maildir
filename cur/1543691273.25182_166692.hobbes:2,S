I tried booting this kernel from 
http://people.redhat.com/arjanv/2.5/
and lost my mouse completely. Here's a snippet from /var/log/messages

I've been testing with the XFree86 packages from rawhide, updated as of
today, and the mouse works ok with the 2.4.x kernel from the same place.
I've got the latest BIOS for this laptop if that matters.
Cheers
