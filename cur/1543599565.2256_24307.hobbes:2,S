The penthouse may thing may be the truth.  Don't really know, don't 
really care.

Actually, it is very illegal to have multiple wives in Utah.  The US Gov 
ernment made Utah outlaw it (I believe in the Utah constitution) in 
order for Utah to gain state-hood.  I do not know why Utah doesn't 
prosecute more of the polygamists, but they have been prosecuting some. 
  Many on child abuse, incest, and other charges as well.  I was once 
told they don't prosecute more because it was hard to make the charge of 
polygamy stick if it was the only charge.  As for the Mormons, they 
excommunicate (kick out) those who are caught practicing.
Please, refer to the message from Eric Andersen for the section of the 
Utah Constitution referring to polygamy. Refer to LDS Official 
Declaration #1 (might be available on lds.org) for the 'Mormons' stance 
on polygamy.
And why do messages that have nothing to do with linux or related 
matters appear on LKM?
