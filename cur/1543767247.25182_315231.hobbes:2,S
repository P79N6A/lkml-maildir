It is not right now, and I don't think joining a namespace is a concept
that fits very well into our architecture.  What does make sense is an
unshare() syscall that takes the CLONE_* argument and unshares those in
the current process from the parent without creating a new process.  Then
you can easily reproduce another namespace by value instead of by reference.
