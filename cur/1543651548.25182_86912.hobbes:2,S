Unfortunately, just making it hard doesn't guarantee that they
won't try anyway. If you're lucky, at least their band aid will
be so disgusting that you won't be fooled into thinking they
might be right.
But ultimately, it's an attitude problem. Even people who learn
about their bugs by source code reading may then produce a
shabby fix.
Hmm, I wonder if Linus has ever done any protocol design,
followed by validation. I always find the havoc a protocol
validator (e.g. Spin) wreaks a very instructive demonstration
of how much source code level "correctness" really buys you :-)
(Or what chances you'd stand of realizing what happened just
from an Oops.)
