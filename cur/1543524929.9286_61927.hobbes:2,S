I do not know if this is the same problem but I have a seemingly FS
cooruption when an fsck is run on the /usr partition (7GB partition). This
is on a Compaq SmartArray controller. When I reboot using the 2.2.14 kernel
the fsck passes fine...
Kernel 2.3.4[012] (4GB memory model). 
HW Config:
3GB Ram
4-550MHz 2MB Cache Xeons
eepro100 nic
Any help is much appreciated...  
Mike...

I'm seeing the exact same problems during kernel builds/untars.
These started occuring somewhere around 2.3.34 I believe.
I'm running a dual celeron bp6 with an eide drive on the 
BX interface (ata33).
cheers,
aaron
