Well ... one *could* argue that there's justification for showing those  
partitions by the exact same argument that there's reason to show devices  
on a SCSI or USB bus. It's just going further down the tree.
Say something like
        /driverfs/root/pci0/00:1f.4/scsi_bus/003/pc_partition/2
Sure, it's software, not hardware. OTOH, it's one of the things that  
change with hotplug. (And incidentally, fdisk changing partitions *might*  
be handled somewhat like a hotplug event ...)
As to linking to /dev, I see no reason why you couldn't have that tree  
include information (not in the tree *structure*, obviously) of what the  
relevant device numbers are. That's more expensive than a lookup with a  
pointer gotten from /dev, but it's certainly possible.
