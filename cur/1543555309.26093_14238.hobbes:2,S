Hi,
Support for some 53c400 cards is still bad (the non-PnP), so I'll start
fixing this.
I'll be my fist kernel job, so please spare me :))
Issues :
53c400a non-PNP still lock this system hard. It starts barking about a
busy SCSI bus, and then I can fsck again.
To Alan : How hard is it to get thing beast (53c400 and family) to be SMP
safe ?? Or is it better to start over again ?
	Regards,
		Igmar
