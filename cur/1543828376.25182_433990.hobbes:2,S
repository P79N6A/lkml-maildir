I think this and your other two patches are fine fixes.  Thanks, Oleg.

For a process CPU clock timer, ->it.cpu.task is the thread group leader.
The group leader can exit and will be a lingering zombie for as long as
other threads in the group live.  The process timers need to keep getting
armed and working both during and after the group leader's exit processing.

Thanks for cleaning that up.  The original rationale behind the checking
for exiting threads was an attempt to avoid process_timer_rebalance
counting a dead thread as live and setting all the live threads' expiry
timers too short, as well as avoiding setting it_*_expires after do_exit
cleared them.  The latter didn't suffice anyway and you've fixed it another
way.  The former doesn't really do any harm, since it just means a
possibility of early wakeup and recheck in the remaining live threads.
Thanks,
Roland
