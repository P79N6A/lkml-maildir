And disk vendors aren't even consistant! At least my 30 GB and 40 GB drives 
have 60036480 and 80418240 sectors, respectively (512 bytes each).
That computes to 30.7*10^9 and 41.2*10^9 or 28.6*2^30 and 38.3*2^30 bytes.
If you want numbers near 30 and 40 you need to calculate 30.0*10^6*2^10 and 
40.2*10^6*2^10!
And as somebody else pointed out, 1 Mbit/s line is't 10^6 bit/s nor 2^20 
bit/s line, either, a but 1024000 bit/s line.
=> Even if Configure.help would use kiB, MiB, GiB etc. it wouldn't remove 
many of the ambiguities. Is it worth the pain?
