I'm confused.
I just rebooted after a user-indiced crash, so I cannot be sure
filesystem corruption isn't to blame, but:
I'm booted in 2.2.0-ac2.  Sound is not compiled in to the kernel, and
I've verified that the pci audio driver from the kernel has not been
compiled at all.
Alsa driver, lib and utils 0.3.0-pre3 are installed.
Modprobe says it cannot locate snd-audiopci when I try to load it.
/proc/modules shows no alsa modules loaded.  Applications such as
timidity cannot play to either the alsa or oss stream.
But sox's play script can.  
W/o alsa loaded.
W/o pci audio modules loaded.
W/o audio compiled into the kernel.
Yet it plays.  
Through the speakers connected to the sound card.
I'm confused.
Does anyone have any ideas?
TIA
