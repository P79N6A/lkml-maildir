Welcome.  I hadn't how many people were tracking this.

With respect to the fix that is final.  The rest of the bug
fixes in my queue are for other problems.    
Mostly my concerns are with respect to apicid vs logical cpu
numbers that I'm not certain are handled properly in the code.
genapic_flat doesn't seem to do any translation.  And I don't
recall if boot_cpu_id is an apic_id or a logical cpu number.
On most hardware it is 0 in either case so it doesn't matter.
