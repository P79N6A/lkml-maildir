if i remember well, with kernels from 2.2.7 (including) to 2.2.10 i got
problems which were triggered by intensive disk activity. they also looked
like IDE related and alan also pointed out that maybe a have
broken/overheated HW.
with 2.2.11 those problems stoped but problems with unpredictable hard
freezes begins (X and/or NFS related?) and also "Sound: DMA (output) timed
out - IRQ/DRQ config error?" messages start occured in my log.
more concrete data can be found in my earlier post while they were writen
more precisely and with fres memories :)
sincerely
