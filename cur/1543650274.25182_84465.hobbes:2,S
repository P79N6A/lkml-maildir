Hi,
  I am looking for a very light weight TCP/IP stack(small memory footprint)
that I can hook in Linux (i.e. replace linux's native stack with new one).
Are there any such stacks available ?? If yes, Is intergrating that stack in
our kernel is seamless or I have to dig real hard in kernel to do that .
Please CC me.
Thanks
Amol
Ps: I am using linux kernel 2.4.2 (please don't flame..)
