Hi all. Sorry for sending again, but my email didn't reach LKML, for
some reason.
Here it is through the web interface ..
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/10/26/181
In short I have contacted O2 Micro for a driver for my MMC card reader
OZ711Mx and they sent me a driver tarball under the GPL. It is made for
2.6.16 and doesn't compile with recent kernels.
I fixed it to compile but it still doesn't work. I am trying as hard as
I can to fix it but my programming knowledge is limited. Any help is
appreciated.
Thank you.
