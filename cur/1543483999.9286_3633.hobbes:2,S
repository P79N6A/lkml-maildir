Hi All,
 With all the oopses being reported by amd owners something sprang to
memory.
There was a bunch of amd k6-2's that are officially said not to run at
100mhz due to a cost cutting measure by amd (big mistake hey!). The chips,
although said to run at 100mhz in the manual are only stable at 66mhz. The
dud chips can be identified by having AFR66 on the chip. 
For more info checkout:

Amid also have some info from memory.
Cheers,
