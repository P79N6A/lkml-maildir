Whoa.  This guy is just too much.  Next he'll start posting in
Kanji.

I'll bet he not only read it, but he inverted every netiquette
rule and follows that instead.  Double killfile for him, with
quotes, underlined, in italics, exclamation points, circles and
arrows, and a big picture on the top of each one..

The sad thing is that he is posting as a capacity of his company
"Interlan".  Not only does he make himself look like a big ass,
but he makes his company look totally unprofessional, especially
after someone else at his company claims to have given him a
talking to.
What he really needs is to be blocked off the internet at
Interlan's router unless mommy is around to ensure he plays well
with others.
