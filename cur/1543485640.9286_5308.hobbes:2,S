Hi all:)
I'm trying to make a Vela scsi mpeg2 decoder work on a redhat 5.2 system.
It's a pretty cool board; it plugs into an isa slot only for power and
takes all commands and input over the scsi bus.
The command set for it is pretty well defined, and I figure I can get
enough of an idea from mt for how to send it commands.  But I need some
pointers on how to add a "decoder" device type to linux.  It shows up as
"Vela" and "Decoder" under the 2940 config menu, but linux doesn't detect
it at boot.
General pointers in broad strokes would be welcome:)
Thanks,
--- David Miller
