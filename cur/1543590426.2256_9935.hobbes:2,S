that's a pretty huge cache, have you considered using 8*9gb disks
instead of 4*18?  what sort of request throughput/latency are you
aiming for?  as the number of requests grows, disk seek times are
a very real problem.

well, lots of bugs in reiserfs have been fixed.. obviously there are
more bugs to come (as always), but on the whole a lot of people are very
happy with it.  there certainly haven't been many posts of reiserfs
corruption lately at all on linux-kernel.

they do?

xfs, while wonderful, probably isn't what you're looking for.  AFAIK it
is intended more for very very very large files.

data loss is always significant.  consider the case where you are forced
to rebuild the filesystem squid's cache directories reside on...
admittedly it is an extreme case, but it is a possibility all the same.
reiserfs is supposed to be very good with lots of small files, which is
the typical case for a squid cache.  however there's no substitute for
actual testing.  benchmark your squid server (use polygraph, from the
squid website) with each fs, and remember to test each of squid's
cache_dir options (diskd, aufs, coffs, ufs).
also appropriate could be ext2 with daniel phillips' directory indexing
patches.
test.  test.  test.  good luck.
