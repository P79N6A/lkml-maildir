Reading the code again it looks like you are right and that this is a
false positive by the coverity checker.
This is what the checker had to say :
346  	asmlinkage long sys_quotactl(unsigned int cmd, const char __user
*special, qid_t id, void __user *addr)
347  	{
348  		uint cmds, type;
Event assign_zero: Variable "sb" assigned value 0.
Also see events:
[var_deref_model][var_deref_model][var_deref_model][var_deref_model][var_deref_model][var_deref_model][var_deref_model][var_deref_model]
349  		struct super_block *sb = NULL;
350  		struct block_device *bdev;
351  		char *tmp;
352  		int ret;
353  	
354  		cmds = cmd >> SUBCMDSHIFT;
355  		type = cmd & SUBCMDMASK;
356  	
At conditional (1): "cmds != 8388609" taking false path
At conditional (2): "special != 0" taking false path
357  		if (cmds != Q_SYNC || special) {
358  			tmp = getname(special);
359  			if (IS_ERR(tmp))
360  				return PTR_ERR(tmp);
361  			bdev = lookup_bdev(tmp);
362  			putname(tmp);
363  			if (IS_ERR(bdev))
364  				return PTR_ERR(bdev);
365  			sb = get_super(bdev);
366  			bdput(bdev);
367  			if (!sb)
368  				return -ENODEV;
369  		}
370  	
371  		ret = check_quotactl_valid(sb, type, cmds, id);
At conditional (3): "ret >= 0" taking true path
372  		if (ret >= 0)
