it's not buggy, it's less performant than what 2.5 could be, it's not a
matter of bugs it's a matter of performance, this is an heuristic, it
can very well do the wrong thing sometime.
What I care about is if it is that it is less performant than any other
2.4 and any current 2.5. That is non obvious to me. The approximation
will never be as good as the perfect accounting, but it's still better
than no approximation at all IMHO, and for sure I don't want to waste
totally idle cpus on a 32way either.

The only thing the ksoftirqd check can do is to generate less
conseguences now.

I argue with that, NAPI needs to poll somehow, either you hook into the
kernel slowing down every single schedule, or you need to offload this
work to a kernel thread.
The other cases of ksoftirqd are meant to avoid the 1msec latency shall
the cpu go idle or shall the irqs arrive faster than the network stack
can process the data. They're all legitimate usages IMHO. And we should
be fine to keep irqs running togeter with softirq, that's the point of
this new check.

this certainly sounds good to me.

ok.
