Hi all,
To make my life easier, can I ask that the series file for any quilt trees in the linux-next tree have a comment at the top to identify their base (either a SHA1 or some other ref in Linus' tree).  Like this:
# BASE <SHA1 or ref>
Also, if you only want a subset of the series file included, you can mark the patches with
# NEXT_PATCHES_START
	.
	.
# NEXT_PATCHES_END
Thanks.
