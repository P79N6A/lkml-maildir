Dear kernel wizards,
first of all, I wish to apologize in case I am asking a questions that has already been discussed much on this list. I am not a subscriber
(so please CC. me if you respond to this mail) and by browsing the list archive I did not immediatly find any discussion about my topic.
So here is my question:
