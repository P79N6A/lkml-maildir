IMHO, this adds unneeded complexity; besides, my solution allows the
attacker to listen on _no_ ports, where sockfs would presumably allow
listening on 53.

named(8) just happens to be my favorite example, but others apply as well; 
at this point, I think the question is: do we implement capabilities as
they were designed to be implemented (stickybit/immutable solution), or do
we break the semantics of capabilities to work around problems in the
solution based on setuid-root?
I reallize setuid-root has better compatibility over remote fs's, but IMHO
correctness of implementation far outweighs this consideration; especially
in light of the fact that stickybit/immutable has much _better_
compatibility than caps in fs metadata, which would wholesale break many
utilities and over all remote filesystems. (caps in fs metadata seems to
be an eventual goal)
cheers,
