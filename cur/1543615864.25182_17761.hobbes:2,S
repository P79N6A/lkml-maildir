If you don't understand why this is idiotic, then let me enlighten you: 
there is no sensible reason why /dev/cpu/%d should only be populated 
after having run a CPU-dependent device driver.  /dev/cpu/%d should be 
always populated; heck, that's the only way you can sensibly handle 
hotswapping CPUs.
I WILL NOT accept a patch as long as devfs is as fucked in the head as 
it currently is.  Unfortunately, that seems like it will be a long long 
time.
