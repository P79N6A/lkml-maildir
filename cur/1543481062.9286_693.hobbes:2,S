I have installed 2.2.0pre8 kernel and booted successfully, 
and encountered following problems, please help me to fix them!
My PC config: Compaq Presario
  CPU: Pentium 200MMX
  HD: IDE 3.2 GB
  Video: S3Verge
  No Network card,
  External modem
After booting :
1. the kernel version is still 2.0.36. 
This is how I compiled and installed my kernel:
   make mrproper
   make dep
   make install (Also I tried make zImage)
   make modules
   make modules_install
2. I compiled ppp as part of the kernel but it turns out to be a
   module?, why, is there any dependencies?
3. I included APM BIOS support, but xapm (apm) still says, there is
   no APM support in kernel.
4. Filesystem type autofs is not recognised any more?
5. No more kernel messages (messages are not logged in
  /var/log/messages, I tried running klogd,but still nothing
  appears there?
6. Compile error in chksum.c (??generic function was missing,I just
   #define existing function to ???generic), Is there any patch?
