here at least 2 problems:
1. the dsp are much less mainstream than x86 so the compilers are more
bugged. i maintain a os which run on a lot of cpu including dsp and have
to experience some really hard-to-find bugs.
2. some dsp can't read a single byte in memory and read only words by words
(eg. 24bits or 32bits). some codes assume they can read 1 single byte in
a non-padded struct. for example: the network stack. the packet parser
must be rewrote to support that.
