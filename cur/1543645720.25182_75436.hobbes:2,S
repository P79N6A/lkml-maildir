Dear diary, on Sun, Sep 29, 2002 at 07:26:37PM CEST, I got a letter,
where Jochen Friedrich <jochen@scram.de> told me, that...

Well, I maintain Point of Presence for XS26 at Prague running on linux
(2.4.19), and it works with almost no problems routing about 20 kilobytes per
second through about 520 interfaces (tunnels) and with routing table consisting
of cca 2100 entries (there's zebra, ospf6d and bgpd running there ;). The only
one real problem we had was neighbour discovery bug up to 2.4.18 which was
fixed along the way to 2.4.19. There are no crashes, no routing instabilities,
we are absolutely happy with linux there ;-) (in fact, we have frequently much
more problems with the *BSDs running at some other PoPs).
Oh, of course, I must thank Alexey a lot for providing excellent support for us
:).

<Beeth> Girls are like internet domain names, the ones I like are already taken.
