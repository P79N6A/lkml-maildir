Yes, but in general when a driver that runs on multiple architectures
(including IA64 btw) needs something architecture specific we usually
add it to asm, not add ifdefs.

e.g. for other hypervisors or possibly for special hardware access
(e.g. I could imagine it being used for some kind of cluster interconnect)
I remember Alan was using a similar hack in his EDAC drivers because
it was the only way to clear ECC errors.

Well we have our share of weird hacks for IA64 too in generic code.
Just adding a single line #include for a wrapper asm-generic surely isn't
a undue burden for the other architectures, and it will save some
mess in the Xen drivers.
