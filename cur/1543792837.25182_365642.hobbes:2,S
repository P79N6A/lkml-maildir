Well.  One problem is that spinlocks now take two words...
But apart from that, the problem at hand is that we want to embed a
spinlock in struct page, and the size of the spinlock varies a lot according
to config.  The only >wordsize version we really care about is
CONFIG_PREEMPT, NR_CPUS >= 4.  (which distros don't ship...)

spinlocks get a lot bigger than that with CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK.

I think some of the debian derivates might.  But who knows?
