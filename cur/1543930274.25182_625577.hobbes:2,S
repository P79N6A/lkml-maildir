Well, how about asking Linus to revert commit
2b1e300a9dfc3196ccddf6f1d74b91b7af55e416 altogether and starting over again?
It apparently causes more trouble than the issue it was supposed to fix.
I've already reopened 
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=9411
 and I'll
regard it as unfixed from now on.
