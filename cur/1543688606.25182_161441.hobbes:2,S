We can change these handcoded 64 bit divs to do_div, with just an
additional data copy 
(as do_div changes dividend in place). But, changing mul into 64x64 '*'
may be tricky. 
Gcc seem to generate a combination of mul, 2imul and add, where as we
are happy with 
using only one mull here.

Yes. That surely makes the patch lot more cleaner. Attached is the
updated rtc 
emulation patch.
