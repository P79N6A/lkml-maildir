I was talking to a couple of friends who also run 2.4.x, they said they 
burn CD's all the time using DMA, and not PIO.
So I looked into the matter, apparently, the kernel sets my hd{b,c} 
(both Plextor 12/10/32A's) drives DMA to disabled.

I even went further and tried:
append="ide-cd=ignore=hdb ide-cd=ignore=hdc"
In my lilo.conf, once again, no luck.
Can anyone offer any suggestions why others can burn CD's in DMA mode, 
yet the kernel keeps disabling DMA for my burners?
Please cc me as I am not subscribed to the list, thank you.
