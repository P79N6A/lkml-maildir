Nobody will want to use bleeding edge hardware with an int13 driver,
because the performance will necessarily be much worse than using more
moderate hardware with the generic IDE driver.
Int13 for new hardware makes no sense to me.  The same goes for
fake raids - linux will usually be able to see the disks as single
disks, and you can then use them as such with a plain
software raid on top.  The fakeraid functionality is not needed,
it has no performance edge precicely because it is fake.
If fakeraid support is necessary to read some existing filesystem,
then implement support in md or dmraid or even as a userspace
filesystem.  Either choice will perform better, and also be
easier to do than making a working and stable int13 driver.
