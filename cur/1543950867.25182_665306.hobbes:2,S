Unfortunately this happens before modules loading --- it's kernel itself.

Actually no and yes. IIUC, the call chain looks like this (it's with
modified clk's functions, so
it may be a bit hard to understand. If you wish, search for "clocklib"
patches posted to LKML
nearly a month ago).
kernel -> clk_enable() takes global clock spinlock -> my function
which calls another spin_lock which causes lockdep warning.
If I disable global clocks spinlock locking, I get the lockdep
warning. Otherwise, I see no output. This seems to be related to the
fact that I have pxa serial console enabled which in turn also uses
clk_enable/clk_disable to manage its serial port.

I have a plenty of modules configured to build, but as I hope this
doesn't count, since they aren't loaded
