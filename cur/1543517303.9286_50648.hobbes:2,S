Hello All,
I'm kind of up a creek here and am hoping someone can bail me out.  Sorry
for my ignorance, but here's the situation.....
I have a v2.2.11 system to which I applied the raw-2.2.11-pre1.diff patch
from raw-19990728.  I applied the patch, 
#mknod /dev/raw c 162 0 through #mknod /dev/raw4 c 162 4,
#chmod 600 /dev/raw* 
and tried to do a #raw /dev/raw1 /dev/sdb1 through #raw /dev/raw4 /dev/sde1
to bind the raw devices to the block devices.
When I try to do a bind, I get an error of "Cannot open master raw device
'dev/raw' (No such device)".  
/dev/raw is listed in /dev.....what am I missing?  Is there something else
that I forgot to do?
Also, after I applied the patch, I am getting an error on the #make install
while trying to recompile the kernel.
The error is as follows:
memory.c: In function `get_page_map':
memory.c:1005: `ZERO_PAGE' undeclared (first use in this function)
memory.c:1005: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
memory.c:1005: for each function it appears in.)
make[2]: *** [memory.o] Error 1
make[1]: *** [first_rule] Error 2
make: *** [_dir_mm] Error 2 
What am I doing wrong?
Any suggestions are greatly appreciated!  Thanks for your help.
Heather
