Hi Andrew,
linux/videodev2.h uses types such as __u8 but it fails to include
<linux/types.h>.  Within the kernel, that's not a problem because
<linux/time.h> already includes <linux/types.h>.  However, there are
user apps that try to include videodev2.h (e.g., ekiga) and at least
on ia64, it causes compilation failures since <linux/types.h> doesn't
get included for any other reason, leaving __u8 etc. undefined.  The
attached patch fixes the problem for me.
Thanks,
  --david
