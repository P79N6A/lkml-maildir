this is an NBD client, using CONFIG_BLK_DEV_NBD?  on the 2.6 series
kernel?  if so, then it, like any other kernel component using the
page cache, needs to explicity use kmap/kunmap to make use of memory
in the high memory zone.  on a 32 bit machine, any pages above the 896
meg mark are treated specially inside the linux kernel (see
http://kerneltrap.org/node/2450
).
if you don't have highmem support (CONFIG_HIGHMEM4G) enabled, then
enabling that should fix it.  if you already have it enabled (it
looked like it to me, based on your /proc/meminfo) then there is a bug
somewhere.
it would seem from a brief inspection that the send/recv_bvec
functions in nbd (2.6.13) do use kmap.  I don't know the nbd code very
well, it seems that Pavel Machek wrote the code, he or block layer
maintainer Jens Axboe may know something I don't.  So if enabling
highmem in your .config doesn't help, try CC'ing them with your issue.
 in the mean time, one of the memory split patches, such as the 4G:4G
patch, should get things working.
