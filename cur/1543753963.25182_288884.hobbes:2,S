It looks like Windows 95's FDISK
command created the partitions.
After that it doesn't matter which
operating systems you connect the
drive to when formatting the
partitions and writing files and
cleaning whatever you want to clean.
The partition boundaries still remain
where Windows 95 put them, and you
have overlapping partitions.
After backing up whatever files you
can still access (and don't trust
the contents of the files either),
zero out the MBR and start over.
