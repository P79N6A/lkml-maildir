That's a good point.

A quick test suggest that it does.

I'm not sure what your rationale for proposing that is, and I don't 
think it helps in my scenario; a user wants their inotify-using 
application to "just work", not to be told to "sudo re-mount".
I suppose that I just need some way to determine whether I will get 
all, some, or none of the events that I've asked for.
