Only 20? You must be doing something horribly wrong. Asynchronous I/O shoudl 
get the speed from whatever you're getting without it to the maximum the 
drive can handle. LZF should double the speed again on a CPU that's fast 
enough that the bottleneck is the disk.

Turn it round the right way. If you can get the functionality of Suspend2 
using userspace only, then we have something to talk about.

And you do need?...

It is only easier because you're not comparing apples with apples. I have no 
desire to spam LKML with this pointless discussion, so I'm just going to get 
on with submitting patches for review.
