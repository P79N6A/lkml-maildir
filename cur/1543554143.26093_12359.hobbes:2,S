A fair point! But I still can't see what the server is doing wrong,
which makes it look like the clients (inc 2.4.0-test10) are misbehaving.

This is a resend of the data sent on line 8 of the trace:
10:10:15.845002 cobalt-box.echo > hydra.3700: P 1:1449(1448) ack 1449 win 31856 <nop,nop,timestamp 0 268081751> (DF)
It looks like hydra didn't ACK this data, so the server eventually
re-sent it?
