It's a vmware thing as far as i know, it just runs the cpuid from the host
and will therefore report what it finds there, but then the kernel gets
confused when it finds that it really doesn't have a sibling processor.
The crash on boot is just a side effect of the new sched domains code
which depends more on this information.
