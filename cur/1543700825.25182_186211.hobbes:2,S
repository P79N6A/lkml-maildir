 I have applied both to 2.6.0-mm1. They are just working, no jumping
mouse pointer when I release the touchpad, and both touchpad+usb mouse
working on console and under XFree86 as well. OK, I could not really
understand how they are working, as for me it seems gpm interprets
/dev/psaux only, and get both pointing device right, still XFree86 which
reads data replicated by gpm via gpmdata can't handle the USB mouse
directly. I had to use a separate config, which reads /dev/input/mice as
well. I think it's because XFree86's synaptics driver skip events from
the USB mouse. Anyway, thanks for your help and work!
Merry Christmas!
