Just where do you think the perl interpreter is going to look to decide what
capabilities to enable? suidperl just stats the script and looks at the
setuid bits to decide what to do. If the capability bits are not in the fs,
where will suidcapperl find them? There ain't no ELF header in a script.
Not that I really care one way or the other about capabilities, just
wondering if anyone has really thought this through before posting "it's up
to the interpreter"
