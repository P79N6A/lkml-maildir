such invariant doesn't exists since 2.4.10. There's no way to get mmaps
reload data from disk without breaking such an invariant. It's not even
for the write side, it's buffered read against O_DIRECT write that
requires breaking such invariant.
Either you fix it the above way, or you remove the BUG() in pdflush and
you simply clear the dirty bit without doing anything, both are fine,
peraphs we should do both, but the above is good to have anyways since
it's more efficient to not even show the not uptodate pages to pdflush.
