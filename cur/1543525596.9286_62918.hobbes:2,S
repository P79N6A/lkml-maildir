: I still have to argue very much against the feature adding comment.  Not all

: streams), but that is just a can of worms I don't want to open.
Once again, you haven't answered the questions.  How many locks would
it take?  Why is it that there are no examples of systems that work like
what you describe and basically all real examples (Solaris, IRIX, AIX,
HP-UX) work like what I describe?
: So to answer A, I take it I should present a summary of all kernel structures 
: and the locking model involved with each of them?  I conceed your point that 
: one can't keep the whole thing in one's head at once, but it isn't necessary 
: to do that.  The locking model can be clearly formulated and intuitive on each 
Can it?  Like I said, 3 times I think, please point me at an example
of it.  Multi threading is a well understood area, quite mature, so there
should be no problem trotting out a mature, multi threaded OS which is
not a locking nightmare.  So _where_ is it?
And if you can't find it, ask yourself why not?

: SMP sucks for greater than 2-4 cpus.  It is way too easy to saturate the bus.
Wow.  I don't agree with that at all.  You haven't gone and talked to
your own hardware people, right?  If you had, you'd know that an Origin
doesn't have _A_ bus, it has a bunches of them, all wired together in
a hypercube.  It's scalable as all get out.
It's the bloody OS that is the problem, not the hardware.
I have to admit that I'm even more surprised than usual by what is
coming out of SGI.  Someone arguing OS design goals who apparently
doesn't understand hardware, not even their own companies' hardware.
Isn't that a little strange?

So what does that have to do with the quoted papers?

: 
: A distributed shared database can easily reach the same order of magnitude on

First of all, we're talking numbers for SMP platforms, which should make
it even easier for you to make your point - a distributed system usually
has much higher latency so the numbers would be dramatically lower,
they have to be, think about it.
Second of all, even on a single SMP system, I have never heard of anything
like what you are describing and I've personally run database benchmarks
and have never seend what you are describing.  So if you have numbers to
back up your claim, that would be nice.  If not, perhaps you can explain
the theory which lead you to this conclusion?
