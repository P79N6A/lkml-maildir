i think that paging and CPU operations only happen at the same
time on a system that has many things to do.  in most cases the
CPU must wait for page operations to complete anyway.  but that
point has probably already been made.

seems to me putting more than 4G into an Intel PC is
"infinitely expensive" -- for anything other than a Xeon
CPU, you can't do it.  does anyone think that using page
compression might help ease this constraint?  what if this
were a way to effectively use more than 4G by, say, making
the "high memory" area a swap staging area?
in other words, this type of effort may have more wide use
than just as a way to make a poor student's machine more
cost effective.
