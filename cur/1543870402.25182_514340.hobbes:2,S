hi uwe,
according to kernel.org 
2.6.21-rc2-git1 is an actual snapshot
but, those are iirc auto generated. thus not being able to compile can happen.
it also depends on your special .config
best regards
marcel
p.s. wouldn't it be a good idea to check your mail recipients instead of sending mails to e.g. linux-dvb that do 
      have no use with fixes of floppy drivers and or compile status in io_apic? :)
dont take it too hard man...
