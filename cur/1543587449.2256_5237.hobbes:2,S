Have you tried using the normal UHCI driver, instead of the UHCI
Alternate Driver (JE)?  I know the "alternate" one is default from
Linus, but it's incompatible with the usb-visor driver.  The
maintainer said he'd patch the docs to clear up the confusion, but it
hasn't shown up in the mainstream kernels yet.
In my case, trying to use the visor would actually lock up the
machine, requiring a cold boot.  Switched to the other UHCI driver
and it works fine.
