Do you have any interest in doing away with the concept of major and
minor numbers altogether; turning the dev_t into an opaque unique id?
At the application level, the kinds of information that is derived from
the major/minor number should probably be derived in some other manner
such as a library or system call. Code that determines device type by
comparing with the major/minor numbers should probably be discouraged in
the long run and this could be a good time to start.
