Yes. It's an atomic access (two, in fact, since you need to release it 
too), which is a huge deal if we're talking about a timing-critical 
section of code.
And this is timing-critical, or we wouldn't even care - even in the 
contention case. Admittedly btrfs apparently makes it more so that it 
_should_ be, but Peter had some timings that happened with just regular 
create/unlink that showed a big difference.
So the whole and only point of spinning mutexes is to get rid of the 
scheduler overhead, but to also not replace it with some other thing ;)
