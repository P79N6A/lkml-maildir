Just for the record, my fault was not having modutils installed when I
built the kernel in a chroot. The kernel-image-deb step threw an
error, so I installed modutils and repeated that step which resulted
in an unuseable kernel.
A more in-depth investigation showed that the missing modutils had an
influence on the kernel build process that did not make it fail.
Repeating the whole process starting with the first step with modutils
installed resulted in a kernel with useable 8139too driver.
Greetings
