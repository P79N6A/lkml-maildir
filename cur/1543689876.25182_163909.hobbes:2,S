The kernel has 4Gb of virtual address space. Because of the way x86
works it really wants to keep the user map, the view of main memory and 
io mappings visible at once. For larger objects you have to use kmap and
map them through a window (anyone remember they joys of EMS). On 64bit
this of course all goes away
