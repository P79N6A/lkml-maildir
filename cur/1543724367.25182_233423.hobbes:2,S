RHEL applies all sorts of patches that have not been tested in mainline, 
and then tells its customers that it is more stable when the reverse is 
true.  RHEL should pick a stable mainline kernel 6 weeks after it has 
proven stable, and use it.
Their not applying reiserfs bugfixes that are present in the mainline is 
just more evidence that they don't care about stability as much as 
marketing.
Lindows does it right.
