Subject: [RFC][PATCH] node hotplug : register_cpu() changes [0/3]
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

With Goto-san's patch, we can add new pgdat/node in runtime.
I'm now considering node-hot-add with cpu + memory on ACPI.
I found acpi container, which describes node, could evaluate cpu before
memory. This means cpu-hot-add occurs before memory hot add.
In most part, cpu-hot-add doesn't depend on node hot add.
But register_cpu, which creates symbolic link from node to cpu, requires
that node should be onlined before register_cpu().
When a node is onlined, its pgdat should be there.
This patch-set holds off creating symbolic link from node to cpu
until node is onlined. 
[1/3] modifies register_cpu
[2/3] changes caller of register cpu
[3/3] changes register_node. create symbolic link fron node to cpu.
By these patch, (cpu + memory) node hot add will succeed.
(cpu-only)/(IO-only) node hot add will need more fixes. (But we need this ?)
And ia64 needs more fixes. I'll post later.
