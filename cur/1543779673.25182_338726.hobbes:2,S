-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us know.
------------------
For inclusion into 2.6.12.stable, extracted from current Linus git:
[PATCH] kbuild: build TAGS problem with O=
  make O=/dir TAGS
  fails with:
    MAKE   TAGS
  find: security/selinux/include: No such file or directory
  find: include: No such file or directory
  find: include/asm-i386: No such file or directory
  find: include/asm-generic: No such file or directory
  The problem is in this line:
  ifeq ($(KBUILD_OUTPUT),)
KBUILD_OUTPUT is not defined (ever) after make reruns itself.  This line is
used in the TAGS, tags, and cscope makes.
