Sorry, I am not understanding you here.  Could you spell it 
out please?  My root filesystem is on the ps2esdi disk, do 
I need to set up an initrd, and load the ps2esdi driver as 
a module?  Or do you mean that I should change things to 
have module_init call it even when it isn't built as a 
module?  Or something else?
Thanks,
