Ah, but it's a bug in the _system_ and glibc is part of the system
too, not just the kernel.
Upgrading glibc solves the problem, so why work around it in kernel
too?
Your patch is not a solution, since readdir will remain nonconforming.
It is basically a workaround for a bug in glibc.  It makes readdir
nonconforming in a different way, but the end result in not
necessarily better.
If you manage to make dcache_readdir conform to SUS without overly
bloating the implementation, that's fine.
