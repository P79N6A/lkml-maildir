Subject: [PATCH] prevent sending wrong signals to a traced process whose tracer gets killed

Hi,
I experienced troubles when tracing a process with strace. Sometimes,
when I killed the strace process (SIGKILL), the traced process was also
killed. I found out that it was getting SIGTRAP and, indeed, when the
traced process set up a signal handler for SIGTRAP, it no longer died.
I noticed that normally, when the traced process is continued (via
PTRACE_CONT or similar), the signal to be sent to it is stored in
current->exit_code, which is then examined by the arch-specific code and
usually leads to something like:
                send_sig(current->exit_code, current, 1);
The exit_code is set in ptrace_stop(), but the tracing process may go
away while the traced process waits for it, and in that case exit_code
is left as-is. I think we must set it to zero in ptrace_untrace().
