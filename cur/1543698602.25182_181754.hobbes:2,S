Hello all,
	This is one of those "How do I ..." questions
about writing a kernel module/driver.
My question is already well phrased and andswered in an
email archived from a few years ago:

That means (I'm not mistaken) that first you use vmalloc
to allocate a contiguous virtual memory region and suply a
`nopage' method (via mmap) which returns the physical page
coresponding to user's _and_ the module's virtual address
plane; that means that after mucking about with page tables
a while; you have two virtual contiguous memory regions
(one user/one kernel) that both access the same physical
scattered pages. ... ( ?? hmmm ??)

This approach basicly save's me from the `nopage' aspect
of the afore mentioned method; but I dont have a contiguous
memory region in kernel space; only in user land.

After reading that (above quoted from...):
  (
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0010.2/0338.html
)
I can understand why.
So If I have a collection of physical pages in a kio buffer
is there a way to create a contigous virtual memory region out
of that ?
ie: unsigned long kmap_kiovec(int nr, struct kiobuf *iovec[]);
Must it be done by modifying the page tables by hand ?
(If so; is "linux" interrested in such an api as kmap_kiovec
or is it total nonsence ?)
Is there a preferred way to do this
   (mmap -> nopage vs. map_user_kiobuf()) ?
Best regards,
                 -Tristan
