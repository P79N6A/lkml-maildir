my experience with sigio-based event-handlers is that the net-gain of 
event-driven i/o is mitigated by the fact that SIGIO is based on signals.
the problem with signals for this purpose are:
  (a) you go thru a syncronization point in the kernel.  signals are protected
      by a spinlock.
      it doesn't scale with SMP.
  (b) SI_PAD_SIZE
explicitly, (b) means that you have an awful lot of memory-accesses going 
on for every signal.
my experience with the overhead is that it mitigates the advantages when 
you become bottlenecked on memory-bus-accesses.
cheers,
lincoln.
