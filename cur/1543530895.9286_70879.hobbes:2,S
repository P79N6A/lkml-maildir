Linux isn't intended to be used in this way. I doubt they installed
Unicos in the nukes either, since Crays tend to be pretty heavy.
I wouldn't want a general-purpose desktop/server OS controlling nukes
or life support systems - so don't ask for those features in my
desktop/server OS.
RTLinux might want these sorts of features, perhaps, but the
desktop/server variant doesn't need it and wouldn't benefit from it.

i.e. any normal desktop/server situation. If they want embedded-type
features, they shouldn't be using Linux to begin with.

The criteria you seem to be trying to apply to Linux just aren't
relevant. You seem to be criticising Linux for lacking features which
you would want in a safety-critical system - but since Linux isn't
intended to be used in this way anyway, why does this matter?
I don't want Linux being installed on any life-support systems,
air-traffic control backends, or missile guidance systems. Equally, I
don't want to run that sort of OS on my desktop or server PC.
