I hacked up something and ran it on my webserver (which has something
like 200 shell accounts). My histogram peaked at 12 rather than 10 but
still hit 90% cumulative at 21 characters.
I suspect worst case is a large LAN fileserver with Samba shares and
whatnot, I suspect there are a large number of "A picture of my cute
puppy I took last summer.JPG" style filenames there. Anyone have stats
for such an FS?
