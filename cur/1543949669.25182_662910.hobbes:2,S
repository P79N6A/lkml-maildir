I think ->resume() can register new children.  There's nothing wrong with
that from the core's standpoint.

Well, it would be a bug not to do so.

Okay, I'll prepare a patch for that, on top of the one introducing the
'sleeping' field into 'struct dev_pm_info' (posting in a while).

Exactly.
The question remains what we're going to do with the drivers without pm_ops
pointers in the long run (in the short run we will use the legacy callbacks in
that cases, if defined).
