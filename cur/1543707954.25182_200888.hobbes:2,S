The sh/sh case failed due to the .rept usage. I'm not entirely sure when
this started to pop up, but it does work again in binutils CVS (or at least
it did the last time I checked it out). For the time being, I've just gotten
rid of it entirely and just padded out with sys_ni_syscall. (Look at your
error log for the exact line).

A lot of that depends on what you're trying to build for. The sh defconfig
is for SH-3, in which case the default gcc and binutils should work just
fine. For SH-2 and SH-4, there's patch work that needs to be done both
for gcc and binutils.

I don't know of one out in the wild. SuperH has their own toolchains that
support this, and is what I currently use. I'm not sure what the status of
their patches are in relation to getting merged into current gcc/binutils.
Richard (CC'ed) might know though, Richard?
