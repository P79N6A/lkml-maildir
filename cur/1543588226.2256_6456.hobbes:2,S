Yes, I could write and test code to handle this in about twenty minutes.
And I was about to do it when I realized that it would be the wrong thing.
The right answer is that CONFIG_SX_SPECIALSTUFF *should* be flagged as
an error -- because it doesn't belong in the CONFIG_ namespace, which
by definition should be reserved for things the configurators control.
It should be called something else: perhaps ENABLE_SX_SPECIALSTUFF
