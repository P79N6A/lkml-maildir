The kernel defines the ABI, but what IS the ABI? Is a single space that
the current implementation delivers an indication that there needs to be
a single space between two values, or could there be an arbitrary number
of spaces and tabs? You certainly can't conclude that from the code.
For /proc files people tended to use sscanf to read lines from the
output. Is the format of a line fixed, or can it be extended by
additional fields? Does certain fields have to start at a specific
offset or not? How long can the different fields get? And so on.

And the user space then uses the parser only? Is now the parser
interface the "ABI" or the kernel interface that is in turn used by the
parser? And what happens if somebody comes up with a "better" parser
that does things subtly different? 
In short: keep the kernel interface as simple as you possibly can. That
is why the single value approach has been invented. A text file that
needs to get parsed is certainly not simple.
