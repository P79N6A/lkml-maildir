How about using much the same approach that SSH uses - have a daemon 
that is launched from the user's .profile, that listens on an Unix 
domain socket created in the user's home directory and tracks the login 
tokens?
Additionally, that daemon could allow another user space program to 
listen to a socket, and be notified when a request for a non-existant 
token is made - this way when a user is running a GUI, the GUI could 
have a program that can pop up a prompt for the login, and then pass it 
on to the daemon, and then the daemon can inform the process that made 
the request to try again.
I do agree with some of the other posters, though - it seems to me the 
best approach would be a plug-in for autofs that used SMBFS.
