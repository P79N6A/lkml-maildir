Indeed. And there are the guinea pigs/lusers like me that are willing to
test and do some roundtrips of reports to get the kernel working better
(with the little that I can help). :-)
Now that I have backups working as I wanted, I surely intend to give the
-mm tree more tries.
Oh, and I would really appreciate if some options had at least some
description when I do a make menuconfig. Would identifying these options
or asking for clarification of others be of any interest?
I do think that they would help me when I try to compile the kernel for
some of my friends' computers.
Thanks, Rogério.
