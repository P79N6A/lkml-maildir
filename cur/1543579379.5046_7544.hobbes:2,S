Sorry for the confusion: The 'mem=48M' test was still running when I
wrote the last mail.
I don't see a corruption - neither with 192MB ram nor with 48 MB ram.
SMP, no SW Raid, ext2, but only 1024 byte/file and only 12500
files/directory.

10000 files need ~180MB, that fit's into the cache.
50000 files need ~900MB, that doesn't fit into the cache.
I'd try 10000 files, but now with "mem=64m"
