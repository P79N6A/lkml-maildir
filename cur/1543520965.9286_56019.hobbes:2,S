Was the kernel USB code ever supposed to work on anything but US
keyboards? 
On Apple ISO USB keyboards in any case, there were always 2 keys
(scancode 50 and 100) unmapped by the keycode matrix. From looking at
the 2.3.36 version, this doesn't seem to have changed. (This cannot
really be tested on a Pmac, because the PPC architecture was left behind
at 2.3.29 or so).
