Doesn't recover.

I think at this point the only thing that works is sysrq-b - at least the
sysrq-u's and sysrq-s's that I've given don't seem to have cleanly
unmounted the file system.

Yep one disc (Scanners) - it is fine - hence my reason for beleiving it is
a CSSism (although I guess CSS makes other demands on the UDF code).
