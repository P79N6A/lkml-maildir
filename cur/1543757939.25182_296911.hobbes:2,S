Hi Anthony,
This is a bit different problem and we trying to find a reliable solution
for it.

It still should work fine, but in a bit different form:
	echo -n "reconnect" > /sys/bus/serio/devices/serioX/drvctl
I.e. substitute "driver" with "drvctl" as now "driver" is a symlink to
a currently bound driver that is set up by driver core.
