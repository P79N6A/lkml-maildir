In response to David Weinehall's reply:
sorry - i forgot that i needed to include more info, i'm new to mailling lists.
We recently upgraded our server to kernel 2.2.16 because there was a bug in 
2.2.14
and the new sendmail required at least 2.2.16.
We built our computer from Abit BE6-II motherboards, Pentium III 550 MHz, 
512Kb cache,
256 Megs ram,  3com 905c nics, 3dfx Vodoo 3 3000 video cards
maxtor 30G hard drive,  standard floppy drive, decend CD-ROM drive
i'm not very familiar with klog, but i'll go with klogd.
do i append a '-x' to the line that calls klogs in the startup scripts or
is there some other better way of preventing klogd from destroying
the Oops information.
Then i guess ksymoops. decodes the oops info
