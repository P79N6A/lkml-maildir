I don't think that is a kernel problem. I've seen those errors with 2.6 
yesterday and today
but it was a messed up lilo situation and root in need of fsck and once 
due to switching
drives/controller positions so root wasn't the same root. devfs, moving 
drives, bios
settings to boot offboard disk controllers, somehow the root isn't the 
same as for the
lilo op.
Sounds like you could just boot an install disk or an old kernel, open a 
shell, fsck, then lilo.
Just make sure your new kernel lists /dev/ide/host?/bus? the same so 
your lilo root= is
pointing to the disk you think it is.
