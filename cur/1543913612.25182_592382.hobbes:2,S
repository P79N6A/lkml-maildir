There's an updated version of that patch at
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/8/27/392
> Shutdown is completely broken on HP NX6??? laptops.
It's not completely broken, it just handles disks incorrectly and we are not
sure whether or not there are any serious consequences of that.  Moreover,
it has happened for a long time now, AFAICT, so that's not a regression.
BTW, in my opinion, we don't really understand why the patch at
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/8/27/392
 actually helps and understanding that might
allow us to fix the problem in general.
Greetings,
Rafael
