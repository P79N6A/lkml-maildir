Hi all,
  The faq says that if you're having problems with the kernel, you should
compile with gcc 2.7.2.x and see if there is still a problem.  Is this still
true?  RedHat is shipping 2.9.something (egcs) and is building their kernels
with same.  Could this be a/the source of some of the stability problems?
  Or, more importantly, should I download and compile gcc 2.7.2.x just so I
can recompile my kernels? 
Thanks
