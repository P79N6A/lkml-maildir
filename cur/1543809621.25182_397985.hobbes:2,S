I'm assuming this isn't a regression, and that it's just been that way 
forever. If so, I'm going to vote for it being merged after 2.6.16 is out. 
We don't need more new stuff, and I think PXA users can either apply the 
patches themselves, or wait a few weeks more..
But if this is actually a regression from 2.6.15, I want to know more 
about it.
