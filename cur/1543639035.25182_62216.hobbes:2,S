That could might give you some (sub)blocks out of order, if the disk
firmware falsely believes that it is free to reorder anything
that reach its internal cache.   Writing to the bitter end
will turn at least one block to garbage as write current fail
in the middle.

One may then wonder if journalling is a safe thing to do,
with out-of-order writes exposed by a power failure...
