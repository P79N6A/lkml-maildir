As far as I can see no mapping table is needed simply because
we place a stub with the irq number of the irq we want to service
at the idt entry of the vector we want to service.
For the old ISA irqs it is certainly a fixed offset.

Certainly worth a look.  I just know that is what the code currently
does.

If you look at NR_IRQ_VECTORS.  32 is currently our estimate on the number
of IRQs sources per cpu.  I think a sane formula for NR_IRQS once
the static limits are removed is something like:
#define NR_IRQS (NR_VECTORS + (NR_CPUS*32))
Which starts out a little high to account for systems that are over endowed
with I/O and sticks with our current fairly high estimate of 32 IRQs per cpu.
Although that 32 may actually come from our the skip 8 logic.

With a per cpu lookup table we get 4 bytes per entry and 256 entries
per cpu = 1K per cpu.  Which ultimately uses 256K, on a 256 cpu
system.  Which is nothing for a machine with 256GB or so of RAM.
And that could really be be 2 bytes per entry.
I really don't care how we generate the stubs, or if we generate
stubs so long as all I need to do is change NR_IRQS recompile and
it works.
