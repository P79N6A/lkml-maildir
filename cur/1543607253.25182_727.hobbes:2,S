I'm trying to understand unnumbered interfaces.  From 
searching the web, they seem to be point-to-point links 
that do not have IP numbers (hence the name).  This is
what alludes:
 1) How do you set a pair on linux boxes to do this? ppp? 
 2) How would a program send data across the link?  Via
sockets?  Or thru /dev/something0?
 3) Does it make sense that to use ethernet?  Not to me
but sometimes I'm wrong :)
I'm sure I'm missing the obvious.  I usually do.  Can
anyone shed some light on this topic?
Thanks,
Mark
