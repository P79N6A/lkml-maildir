Hi!
I'm writing a module where I need to build and send a packet by hand. 
For this I properly (at least I hope so) fill a sk_buff structure and 
send it using NF_HOOK (seem to work fine, NF_HOOK returns 0). Sending 
one packet goes fine, sending several leads to kernel crashes. I think I 
don't handle correctly the release of the memory, but how should I do? I 
have no destructor function in my sk_buff, do I have to have one? (here, 
my attempts also lead to kernel crashes).
Bye,
         Emmanuel
