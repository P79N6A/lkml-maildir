Here you can mix two different issues:
  - Ataris have a byte-swapped IDE interface. Hence we need support to swap
    data for interoperability (not only on Atari: imagine an Atari disk
    connected to a PC)
  - IDE is little endian, so the drive identification is little endian too.
    To make things more complex, not only multibyte objects, but also text
    strings are byteswapped.
