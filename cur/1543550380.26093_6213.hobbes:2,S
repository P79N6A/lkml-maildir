I guess they realise that pissing off their own users
isn't doing them much good ;)
It's good to see that people will again be able to use
Linux and MS products at the same time without having to
be too afraid of being left in the dark when the MS side
of things is getting trouble ...

Good thing for the users of the NTFS filesystem.
Maybe MS made this decision because they weren't willing to
force users into making the choice of either continuing to
use NT or permanently ditching it without the chance of going
back ;)
(and when somebody has an NTFS volume and wants to use Linux
with it, it's not that hard to guess which way they're migrating
their system)

Rik
