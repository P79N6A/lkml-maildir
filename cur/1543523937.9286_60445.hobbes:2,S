That's what kmap is supposed to do.  Possibly kmap isn't doing it yet,
but kmap is supposed to do that.
In particular, kunmap is much faster than vfree: it knows it doesn't
have to invalidate the TLB every time.

I'm sure this part is especially interesting.  I think this is what
Stephen Tweedie was intending to do with b_data all along, though
without such a large overhead in virt_to_phys and phys_to_virt due to
page table complexity.
It's nice that it works.  If it fixes current PAE problems that would be
even more brilliant: that would be motivation to do the kmap thing and
get rid of bounce buffers once and for all.

Speak to Stephen Tweedie.  He's written about doing this in a similar
way before.  But without having to modify virt_to_phys.
enjoy,
