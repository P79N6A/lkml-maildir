1. Unsafe setuid programs have been written, and they doubtlessly
will continue to be written.
2. Lisp systems are written by extremely competent people.
(who make mistakes nonetheless, but still..)
3. I think that the ability to choose whether or not to shoot oneself
in the foot is an important freedom.
4. The whole issue is a little bit unfair, because the UNIX world
is inherently C-centric -- everything outside the C niche does not,
indeed, fit flawlessly in the picture..
This is where the "if you want to write system software, do it in C"
model comes from.
5. If a killer use-case is needed, an X server might do -- these
need root privileges for a certain period.
What if i decide that i want to write one in Lisp?

  ^^^^^^^^^^^ make that a compiler -- these days, probably, there are more
native-bytecode-generating lisp compilers than interpreters.

This might sound as a reasonable solution.
Although it places a certain burden, which has to be considered...
I should see what the SBCL people will say about that.

Compiler, not interpreter, careful with the insults :-)
