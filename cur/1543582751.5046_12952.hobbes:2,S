Hi,
With CONFIG_SYSCTL=n, I get the following warnings:
sysctl_net_ipv4.c:50: warning: `tcp_retr1_max' defined but not used
sysctl_net_ipv4.c:52: warning: `ip_local_port_range_min' defined but not used
sysctl_net_ipv4.c:53: warning: `ip_local_port_range_max' defined but not used
These are defined static in sysctl_net_ipv4.c, and appear to only be
exported via procfs.  In other words, you can set them to whatever you
like and the IPv4 stack couldn't care less.
Why do we have them?  If they're not used, can we either eliminate them,
or else move their definition within the '#ifdef CONFIG_SYSCTL' to
eliminate the warning?
Thanks.
