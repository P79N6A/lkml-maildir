Ville Herva pointed out that it'd be modifying in core structures, so maybe it 
is the right thing to do. I do like the idea of every setuid file needing to 
be listed in one place.
I still find "mount --bind --capability=xx,yy /usr/bin/foo /usr/bin/foo" to be 
a strange syntax. It implies that one is mounting /usr/bin/foo over 
/usr/bin/foo, and adding the xx,yy capabilities.
