This seems about right, but one thing bothers me in the traces; it seems like 
there is some locking that is missing.  In
http://people.redhat.com/esandeen/traces/eric_ext3_oops1.txt
for example, it looks like journal_dirty_data gets started, but then the 
buffer_head is acted on by journal_unmap_buffer, which decides this buffer is 
part of the running transaction, past EOF, and clears mapped, dirty, etc.  Then 
journal_dirty_data picks up again, decides that the buffer is not on the right 
list (now BJ_None) and puts it back on BJ_SyncData.  Then it gets picked up by 
journal_submit_data_buffers and submitted, and oops.
Talking with Stephen, it seemed like the page lock should synchronize these 
threads, but I've found that we can get to journal_dirty_data acting on the 
buffer heads w/o having the page locked...
I'm still digging, and, er, grasping at straws here... Am I off base?
