I built the latest GDB-6.3, as well as rebuilt glibc-2.3.5, and now when 
I step through the
main code line, which creates the tasks (I'm using the pthreads.c from 
the GDB testsuite), I do
not getany output from:
info threads
When I set a break point on the entry point of one of the 
soon-to-be-created threads,
I get a diagnostic message:
Program terminated with signal SIGTRAP, Trace/Breakpoint trap.
The program no longer exists.
On the machine being used to debug the kernel is: 2.6.5.
Is there any problems with that kernel, or should I upgrade to a more 
recent vintage
version?
Thanks
John Clark
