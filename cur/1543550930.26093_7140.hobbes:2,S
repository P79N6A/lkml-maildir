Subject: [OOPS] Oops on boot with 2.4.0-test9, usb-uhci, pegasus

Hi'all,
Trying to get nfsroot to work on 2.4.0-test9 with my pegasus-based USB nic, I
got the following Oops (copied values by hand from screen, this is a diskless
(iopener) system which does not save logfiles... sorry no call trace):
[and, by the way, this is the usb-uhci driver. The other (uhci) driver does NOT
oops, nor does it work for nfsroot... it has a nasty delay in device
initialisation, which caused nfsroot to not see the ethernet device --> no root
--> panic...]
