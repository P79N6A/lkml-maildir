Here is a new idea, what do you think about using spin_trylock(), e.g. 
something like:
	if (spin_trylock(&new_base->t_base.lock)) {
		timer->base = &new_base->t_base;
		spin_unlock(&base->lock);
	} else
		new_base = container_of(base, tvec_base_t, t_base);
It's not like we must start the timer on the current cpu and this might 
even be faster. If the new base is busy on another cpu, it's possible we 
have to pull dirty cache lines from the other cpu, where we might already 
have the data from the current base already in the cache from the detach.
bye, Roman
