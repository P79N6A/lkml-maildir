Indeed it is. Dual Xeon with SMP.

Yes, this sucks. I rebooted with vesafb active, no I do have 50 lines :)

It's actually the second time. The first time it hit the SAME box but
with kernel-2.6.10 (vanilla) after 30 days of uptime. Nobody had a
camera at hand, so I couldn't take a photo.
Any suggestions? I'm open to suggestions. One difference between the
2.6.10 and 2.6.10-ac12 was that 2.6.10 has no in-kernel irq
balancing, while in 2.6.10-ac12 I acivated that.
