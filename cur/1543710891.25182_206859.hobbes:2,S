There are at least 4 different O(1) schedulers in different 2.4 trees still in 
existence and the value of the penalty only started changing when 2.5 
development began. Therefore, no one value is what was in "2.4 O(1)" since 
there was no "standard" O(1). 2.6 is a completely different beast in 
estimating interactivity than the 2.4 O(1) kernels so changes do not work as 
expected upstream.

Actually that's what it used to be on the first O(1) patches for 2.4

Even less than that logic would reveal because this particular part of the 
estimator is far less important with the heuristics examining process 
behaviour very rapidly in 2.6. This value is more important in the estimator 
in preventing a fork bomb more than anything else.

See above; it is a penalty the way the estimator currently works.

As I said; the 2.6 estimator does much in determining interactive tasks 
shortly after forking than just this simple knob affects.

Please don't use contest as this does _not_ measure interactivity; it measures 
responsiveness which is quite different. Interactivity is avoiding scheduling 
latency and scheduling jitter in tasks where that latency and jitter would be 
palpable. I have ideas for coding a benchmark to measure such a thing but not 
the time to do it.
Please I encourage you to try whatever testing and modifications you want; but 
this is nowhere near as simple as it appears on the surface.
