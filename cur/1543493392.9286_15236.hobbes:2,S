Aaaaahh
I'm going mad....
I've got kernel 2.2.3 (debian 2.0)
If I ping my machine it's at 1 ms
Then I disconnect my (DIN) keyboard... 
My machine begins to yell:
Keyboard timeout[2]
My ping time falls to 2000 to 3000 ms !!!!!!
Hmmmm... looks like the cpu is wasting some time on the keyboard here (and
it's isn't even there... )
Some one??
GrEetZz
