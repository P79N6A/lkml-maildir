   Boots with recent 2.5 greet me with this on the console:
   [/sbin/fsck.ext2] fsck.ext2 -a /dev/sda6
   fsck.ext2: Device not configured while trying to open /dev/sda6
   This happens because I have root on /dev/sda4 and /home on /dev/sda6.
   Dave, can you take it or should I send it to Trivial?
Yes, Viro added this bug in one of his cleanups.  And I just
continued the bug when I patched in the RAID auto-detect
support.
Applied, thanks.
