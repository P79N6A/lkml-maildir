Are we picking nits?  Better add "the same dev" and "until the buffer head is 
freed" ;-)
<Attempting to add some content> I've always felt that passing the blocksize 
and hashing on it is just a little bizarre.  This means for example that you 
can have two 2K buffers overlaid on a 4K buffer, and they will be entirely 
non-coherent. If we substitute "mapping" where "dev" goes we wouldn't need 
the size any more.  We could still take it and just BUG if it doesn't match 
the mapping.
Bearing in mind Linus's comments about the liklihood that we might see mixed 
block sizes in a single mapping something in the future.
