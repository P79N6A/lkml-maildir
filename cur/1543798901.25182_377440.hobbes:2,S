I've heard reports of this sort of thing before I think, but I'm
wondering why I never experience it.
What sort of drives do you have? What controller?

AS tries to guess how a process is behaving and the raid1/rebuild
process probably is confusing it.  But it is hard to say how until I
can reproduce it.
