Then leave that task to others ;-)
We must consider the case where the kernel is built, and then a random
3rd party module comes along that needs crc32 features.  An ar library
won't cut it, and neither will [the existing crc32 method of] patching
linux/lib/crc32.c.  That leaves (a) unconditionally building it into the
kernel, or (b) Makefile and Config.in rules.
