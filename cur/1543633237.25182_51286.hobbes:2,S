Try "are no longer supplied by raw kernel source" instead.
They damn well better exist, cleaned up for non-kernel use.

Too late. You're WAY too late. This is on a Debian box:
$ /bin/ls -ldog /usr/include/linux
drwxr-xr-x   11 root        28672 Jun  4 19:41 /usr/include/linux
As you can see, a kernel upgrade would do nothing to
change the headers in /usr/include/linux.
