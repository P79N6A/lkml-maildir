I know nothing about cpuset.c, a _very_ naive question.
Do we really need task_lock() (used by cpuset_cpus_allowed) here ?
If not, probably we can make this simpler. CPU_DEAD takes cpuset_lock(),
move_task_off_dead_cpu() uses guarantee_online_cpus() which doesn't sleep,
so we don't need other changes.
Possible?
If not, this patch should also change migrate_dead(), it still calls
move_task_off_dead_cpu() with irqs disabled, no?
Oleg.
