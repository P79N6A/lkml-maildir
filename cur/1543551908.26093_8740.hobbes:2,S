Are you sure you don't mean PG_Reserved?
If they get removed from the process's working set, then sure --- why
not?  Why should the driver care?  As long as the page is pinned in
physical memory (ie. as long as it has a raised page count), the
driver won't mind at all.  If your vma has a nopage method to
reestablish the ptes on page fault, then swap would work fine, just as
long as we fix the problem we've already identified about swapout
writing pages early rather than once they are finally leaving the swap
cache.
It's a completely different matter if you're dealing with ioremap of
PCI-aperture pages, but that's mostly because they don't have valid
struct page *'s (at least not unless you have 4GB ram).

Umm, we've already said that we want to fix the raw IO problem by
setting the page dirty on initial swapout but doing the IO once we
know it's only in swap cache.  Do that and we won't ever write a swap
page that is mapped by any IO subsystem.
