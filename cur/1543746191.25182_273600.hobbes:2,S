Not quite if I understand your question.  I was referring to
avoiding having a global lock to synchronize the conglomerate
data structure when doing a PI dependency walk.  The problem
is the lock must be acquired not only in PI scenarios but in
any case which may possibly lead to one or affect a concurrent
PI in progress.
True this global lock is mostly an issue for large count
SMP systems.  But as witnessed by such voodoo[1] mechanisms
as rcu, scalability problems are real at that end of the
spectrum.
