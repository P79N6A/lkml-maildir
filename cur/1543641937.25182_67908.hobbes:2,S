Which compiler to you use, and which kernel? Which additional patches?
With my 2.4.20-pre4-ac1 kernel, the lock_kernel is at offset +3a, 
according to your dump it's at +6a.

Is it possible to display the cpu registers with kdb? Could you check 
that the interrupts are enabled?
I'd add a quick test into sys_ioctl() or lock_kernel: save_flags, and 
check that bit 9 is always enabled. Check __global_cli for sample code.
The X server probably runs with enough priveledges to disable the 
interrupts, perhaps it's doing something stupid.
