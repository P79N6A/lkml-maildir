Subject: [PATCH 4 of 4] x86: update reference for PAE tlb flushing
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/1/28/571

Remove bogus reference to "Pentium-II erratum A13" and point to the
actual canonical source of information about what requirements x86
processors have for PAE pagetable updates.
