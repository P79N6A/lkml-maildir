 Well, this will change eventually when I submit the patch for Broadcom 
SiByte platforms so that sb1250-mac.c will be able to request an interrupt 
for the PHYs.  All the infrastructure is in place except from platform 
code to configure the SOC's GPIO line used for the interrupt input (when 
applicable) and let the driver know what the line actually is.

 I do not object and can certainly cooperate, but cannot make it a high 
priority work for me at the moment -- sorry.
