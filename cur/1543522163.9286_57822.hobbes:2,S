Might there be another reason for this possibly? As I point out in
the zone balance doc, if there are way too many non-dma pages, then
even when the dma zone is near empty, it will not be balanced because
the total number of free pages is above the watermark.
Alan did acknowledge this as a theoretical case, although he mentioned
that it was not happening in real life.
