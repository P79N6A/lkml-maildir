I believe that the spotlight facility of MacOS, and the somewhat similar 
Longhorn feature (think Google desktop search/indexing on steroids) 
qualify as killer-apps.   I am concerned about how to do better with our 
implementations across a distributed (NFS, CIFS etc.) network.   And of 
course coalescing async notifications most efficiently is a fascinating 
and difficult area to do right - for servers at least.
