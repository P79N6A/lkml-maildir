Hmm, I tried to reproduce, but none of my boxes shows that.
Could it be an init-order problem, where something tries to use the
block subsystem? Before it is initialized with:
  block/genhd.c :: subsys_initcall(genhd_device_init);
If that's the case, we have an old bug that nobody noticed with static
structures, which are zeroed that time, but definitely not properly
initialized.
I'll try to build loop non-modular now, and see if that makes the bug
appear here.
