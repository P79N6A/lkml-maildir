It is a finger print authentication USB driver. it doesn ot do the authgentication but transports data to the application which really does some processing.
No, I did not find any Documentation/kref.txt.
But I have read about kred in the link below:
http://developer.osdl.org/dev/robustmutexes/src/fusyn.hg/Documentation/kref.txt
Is kref depricated because I find nothing related to it in linux/Documentation/?
Thanks & Regards,
