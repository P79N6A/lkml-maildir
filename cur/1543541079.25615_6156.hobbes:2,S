yap, I'll be working on it tonight, and yes, there's lots more on
other drivers, that I'm working now. From now on I'll be sending
patches to individual drivers and not a whole bunch of fixes (or
new bugs ;) ).

nod, will be checking this as well.

Linus asked me to do it the way you ask here, I've already reworked the
patch to do it this way and have already sent to you.

the acenic one isn't needed, and yes, I'm now sending the patches to
the maintainers and to lkml.

ok, this driver needs more work, one guy here have already spotted one
bug I've introduced, fixing this as well.

Ok, it handles some of the issues that you've talked here and that other
people pointed to me, I'll be looking at the rmmod cases tonight, as well
as auditing these cases on the pcmcia drivers, that also have several
cases like the ones discussed here.
