Sure. So dma-mapping.h does this:
	int dma_supported(struct device *dev, u64 mask) {
		return device->bus->dma_supported(dev, u64 mask);
	}
And USB, when it creates its bus_type, does this:
	int usb_dma_supported(struct device *dev, u64 mask) {
		usb_dev *usbdev = to_usb_device(dev);
		return usbdev->root_hub->controller->bus->dma_supported(controller, 
u64 mask)
	}
And of then PCI has:
	int pci_dma_supported(struct device *dev, u64 mask) {
		pci_dev *pcidev = to_pci_dev(dev, u64 mask);
		...
	}
Then a USB driver uses its own usb_device->dev and it all ends up back 
at the PCI bus.
For PCI devices of course, device->bus->dma_supported() *is* 
pci_dma_supported(), so there's no middleman (as USB is above).
