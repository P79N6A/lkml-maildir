Please show the output of hdparm /dev/hda:
/dev/hda:
 multcount    = 16 (on)
 IO_support   =  0 (default 16-bit)
 unmaskirq    =  0 (off)
 using_dma    =  1 (on)
 keepsettings =  0 (off)
 readonly     =  0 (off)
 readahead    = 256 (on)
 geometry     = 65535/16/63, sectors = 117210240, start = 0
You will probably see using_dma = 0 there. This in turn probably means you
did not compile in the right IDE driver. Try hdparm -d1 /dev/hda, and/or
recompile your kernel.

You did not specify any details of your kernel compile so it is hard to
tell.
