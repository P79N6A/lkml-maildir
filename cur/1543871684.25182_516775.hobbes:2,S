I ran xfsqa over it, which should catch this case.

I should have made my wording more clear, we always do PAGE_SIZE +
buffer allocations.  After XFS_BUF_SETP_PTR the actually used buffer
might be smaller.  I tested XFS_BUF_SETP_PTR manually with
artifical test code aswell, and made sure it still works.
Long term I have a plan to replace XFS_BUF_SETP_PTR with better
schemes, but that's irrelevant for this patch.
