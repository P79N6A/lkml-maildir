Has anybody looked into the inode and dcache overhead of all this stuff, 
which I assume is pinned into memory a la ramfs?
I wonder if sysfs attributes could be accessed via the extended 
attribute VFS API?  A file full of EA's can easily be considered a 
key-value database, or attribute-value in this case :)  The EA names and 
values need not pin a bunch of inodes and dcache entries, either.
(though viro may scream at my mention of EAs :))
