Ok, I've bisected this problem and found that this patch broke my NIC:
76d2160147f43f982dfe881404cfde9fd0a9da21 is first bad commit

    [PATCH] genirq: do not mask interrupts by default
    Never mask interrupts immediately upon request.  Disabling interrupts in
    high-performance codepaths is rare, and on the other hand this change could
    recover lost edges (or even other types of lost interrupts) by
conservatively
    only masking interrupts after they happen.  (NOTE: with this change the
    highlevel irq-disable code still soft-disables this IRQ line - and
if such an
    interrupt happens then the IRQ flow handler keeps the IRQ masked.)
    Mark i8529A controllers as 'never loses an edge'.

After reverting it on top of 2.6.21.3 (with
d7e25f3394ba05a6d64cb2be42c2765fe72ea6b2 - [PATCH] genirq: remove
IRQ_DISABLED (which ment "remove IRQ_DELAYED_DISABLE")), the problem
didn't show up :)
(
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=d7e25f3394ba05a6d64cb2be42c2765fe72ea6b2
)
So I cooked patch like below and everything is working fine (so far)
Fix default_disable interrupt function (broken by [PATCH] genirq: do
not mask interrupts by default) - revert removal of codepath which was
invoked when removed flag (IRQ_DELAYED_DISABLE) wag NOT set
