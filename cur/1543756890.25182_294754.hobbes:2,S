We've tried with no cache and we had multiple failures over the weekend.
We are running 2.4.20 on some of these boxes and it is stable.  We're
only having problems with the 2.6 kernel.
These systems did stay running for a few hours and then started dying every
few minutes and then stable again for a few hours.  They are in a air
conditioned machine room with UPS power supplies and we have 11 identical
2500 systems.  Only the ones running 2.6 have issues and those issues start
the moment 2.6 is installed so we're convinced its software.
What's puzzling me is that the aacraid driver isn't so different between
2.4.20 and 2.6.  Is there a debugging run or something that I can get that
would help diagnose the problem?
