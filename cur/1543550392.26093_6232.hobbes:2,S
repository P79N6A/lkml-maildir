If you look at the lkml archives at
http://boudicca.tux.org/hypermail/linux-kernel/,
 for example, you see
this same thread every couple of days since -test8 came out 3 weeks ago
(2000week37). Fixes have been posted, and -test9pre1 contains a fix.
IMHO, the latest reasonably stable 2.4.0 kernel is 2.4.0-test9pre1 and
not 2.4.0-test8. 
I find it pretty weird that such a manifestly buggy kernel version has
remained the "official" 2.4 kernel for more than 3 weeks now.
