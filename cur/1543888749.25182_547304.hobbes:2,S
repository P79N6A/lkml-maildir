Subject: [patch 30/69] udf: decrement correct link count in udf_rmdir

-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us know.

From: Stephen Mollett <molletts@yahoo.com>
It appears that a minor thinko occurred in udf_rmdir and the
(already-cleared) link count on the directory that is being removed was
being decremented instead of the link count on its parent directory.  This
gives rise to lots of kernel messages similar to:
UDF-fs warning (device loop1): udf_rmdir: empty directory has nlink != 2 (8)
when removing directory trees.  No other ill effects have been observed but
I guess it could theoretically result in the link count overflowing on a
very long-lived, much modified directory.
