No, they are not lost. Doug is working on them and will send you
something shortly (EOD today).

Several reasons:
A) Auditability: we don't do "secret" SMI calls behind people's backs.
This is an issue for some of our larger customers. This also provides a
legitimate reason that I can use to justify to management publicly
documenting the rest of the SMI calls that are not in use by our
software. Things like: "Hey, SomeBigDellCustomer wants to know what Dell
is doing with the open source dcdbas driver and all of the other SMI
function docs" pull a lot of weight.
B) Safety: It is easier to provide a single API with well defined
semantics so there are no race conditions when multiple programs try to
do SMI at the same time. SMI from userspace can be tricky, and I want to
make it easy to get right. Things like finding an usused BIOS reserved
area and coordinating access between multiple programs can be difficult.
Additionally, finding an area large enough to hold everything for the
larger SMI calls is tricky (ie. depends on which system, BIOS memory
layout, etc. Very difficult to safely code for and mostly not worth the
effort if we can get this driver in).
C) host control actions need to happen in kernel at shutdown, so that
part of the driver needs to be in the kernel. (this part isn't the part
that provides generic SMI stuff to userspace)
