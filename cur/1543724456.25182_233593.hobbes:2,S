I have a courier-imap Server where I share all all mailinglists where 
I am subscribed... Curently I have 5,2 Millionen Messages in the ext3.
I have already striped the messages with 
:0 fh
| formail -f -I Received: -I Envelope-to: -I Delivered-To:  -I Return-path: \
-I X-Spam-Checker-Version:   -I X-Spam-Status: -I X-Spam-Level: 
I have a mailsize of around 2,5 kBytes...
So I habe used 'mkfs.ext3 -b 1024 -N 8000000 ... /dev/sda..'
My question is, how many Inodes can I create on a ext3 filesystem  ?
Curently I am running a 3Ware Raid-5 Controller 75xx with 3 x 80 GByte.
>Cheers, Andreas
