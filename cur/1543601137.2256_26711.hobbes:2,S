Subject: [PATCH] lazy umount (1/4)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2001/9/14/82

	Patch below (and 3 incrementals to it) implement lazy-umount.
Some background: right now umount() does the following
	* find vfsmount
	* check if it's busy
	* detach from mountpoint and drop a reference
	* mntput() the sucker and return, letting the garbage collection to
do its job - free vfsmount and possibly deactivate and free superblock.
As the matter of fact, kernel will be quite happy to do the same for busy
vfsmounts - they will simply float around (not attached to anything)
until the become non-busy.  At that point they will be freed, etc.
Situation is analogous to unlinked but still busy files - detaching
the tree as analog of removing a link and deactivation (put_super()) as
analog of finally destroying the file.
There are only two things to take care of -
	a) if we detach a parent we should do it for all children
	b) we should not mount anything on "floating" vfsmounts.
Both are obviously staisfied for current code (presence of children
means that vfsmount is busy and we can't mount on something that
doesn't exist).
NOTE: default behaviour of umount(2) is not changed.  We have a new
flag (MNT_DETACH) that tells umount() to be lazy.  If it is absent -
everything works as usual.
It's _very_ useful in a lot of situations - basically, that's what
umount -f should have been.  E.g. suppose that /usr is kept busy
by something (NFS hard mount/hung process/fs bug/whatever).  Right now
we can't do anything about that - it will keep mountpoint busy.
umount("/usr", MNT_DETACH) will do the following:
	a) detach the damned thing from /usr. Nothing is mounted here
anymore.
	b) umount /usr/local, etc. - no matter what state /usr is in and
how badly it's b0rken.
	c) as soon as that fs becomes not busy it will be deactivated
(put_super(), etc.)
	d) if /usr/local wasn't busy - fine, it gets deactivated
immediately. If it was - no problem, it will be deactivated as soon
as it isn't busy anymore.
Code got a lot of beating here during the last 4 months - it's very
convenient when you are doing fs hacking ;-)  Actually I've got into
a habit of using that instead of normal umount in all cases except
the shutdown scripts - works just fine (for obvious reasons in case
of shutdown non-lazy behaviour is precisely what we want).
It had been in -ac since 2.4.8-ac8 (more than three weeks).  Also no
problems.  Please, apply.  Patch is split into 4 pieces, incremental
to each other.
Part 1/4:
	Killed move_vfsmnt(). change_root() does detach_mnt() and attach_mnt()
by hands.
