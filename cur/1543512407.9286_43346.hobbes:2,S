Subject: kapmd taking large amounts of cpu

just an idle question out of the blue, over the last few releases, i've
noticed kapmd is taking anywhere between 10 and 40% of the cpu.  it
isn't having a huge impact most of the time but does contribute.
it hasn't squeeked loud enough for me to really look at it, but does
anyone have any suggestions as to why it's consuming cycles at such a
rate?
kernels range from 2.3.18 to 2.3.20 in 1/2 a dozen different cpu models
and systems.  it consumes cpu on all of them.  idle or active.
