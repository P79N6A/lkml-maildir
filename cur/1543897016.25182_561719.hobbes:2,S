Yes, looks good. I originally came up with _IOC_TYPECHECK before we had
the generic BUILD_BUG_ON(). 
One minor issue though:
While BUILD_BUG_ON and a few other macros in linux/kernel.h are currently
exported to user space, I would think that they should really be hidden
in #ifdef __KERNEL__, which means that we also need something like
#ifdef __KERNEL__
#define _IOC_TYPECHECK(t) \
        (sizeof(t) + BUILD_BUG_ON_ZERO(sizeof(t) == sizeof(t[1]) && \
          sizeof(t) < (1 << _IOC_SIZEBITS)))
#else
#define _IOC_TYPECHECK(t) sizeof(t)
#endif
