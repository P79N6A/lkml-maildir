Then I suggest that you are doing something extremely wrong here.  The
base filesystem code for both debugfs and securityfs, is around 200
lines of code, including comments.  And they are both not
"my_school_project_fs".
If you want to get a bit fancier, and parse some mount options and
provide a persistant mount state, like usbfs, it grows to about 350
lines of code.
Again, not a "fake" filesystem by any means.
And, for another example, ndevfs was posted to lkml over a year ago as a
bad joke and can be found at:
	
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/gregkh/gregkh-2.6/patches/bad/ndevfs.patch
and weighs in at a whopping 249 lines for all of inode.c (comments and
whitespace included.)  It was a full-blown filesystem that handled
almost exactly what you will need to handle.
So please, before you critise me for not knowing exactly how much work
it takes to implement a ram-based filesystem for something like this,
take a look at a few of the already published and shipping
implementations, and note who wrote them...
Otherwise you look quite foolish.

Perhaps because your usage is not what it is intended for?  Yeah, I
know, if all you have is a hammer...

There's a world of difference between something as complex as unionfs
and something that merely makes a few calls to the libfs code already in
the kernel.
And if you don't realize this, then yes, I would not recommend that you
should write your own fs.  But I would then recommend that the task then
be passed on to someone else in your group who does have the capability
to do so...
