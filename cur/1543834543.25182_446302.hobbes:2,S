We cannot do a single kmalloc() like cpuset does.
The kernel presently kind-of guarantees that a 32k kmalloc() will work,
although the VM might have to do very large amounts of work to achieve it.
But 32k is only 8192 processes, so a snapshot will need multiple
allocations and a list and trouble dropping and retaking tasklist_lock to
allocate memory and keeping things stable while doing that.  I suspect
it'll end up ugly.
And it permits userspace to pin rather a lot of memory.
