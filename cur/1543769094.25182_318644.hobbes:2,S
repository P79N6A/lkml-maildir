Subject: [PATCH] i386: Selectable Frequency of the Timer Interrupt.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Make the timer frequency selectable. The timer interrupt may cause bus
and memory contention in large NUMA systems since the interrupt occurs
on each processor HZ times per second.

+	  Note that the timer interrupt occurs on each processor in an SMP
+	  environment leading to NR_CPUS * HZ number of timer interrupts
+	  per second.
