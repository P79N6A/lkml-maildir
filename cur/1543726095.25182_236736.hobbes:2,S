Yes.

I did nothing to address this. So far it works well, even under heavy 
load. I guess a general solution needs to address this as well.
The kernel NFS client (which kswapd depends on) has the same issue. Has 
anyone ever observed kswapd deadlock due to imcoming or outgoing NFS 
packets being discarded due to oom?
