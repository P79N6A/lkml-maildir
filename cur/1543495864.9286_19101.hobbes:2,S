What makes you doubt 99.9% uptime?  If you can average two days between
reboots, and assuming 90 seconds to reboot, you get 99.9% uptime.
Considering that support companies that actually offer uptime
guarentees require you to run specific hardware and software
configurations, so they can pick known good hardware and applications,
99.9% is not hard to meet.
