Hi!
n2cd now works for me (i.e. I've now two laptops connected using
infrared ports but without using irda stack. And one of them is
toshiba with toshoboe driver.)
Unfortunately, I'm currently stuck at 9600. Irda defined its own
structure irda_device, and function for changing speed is in that
special structure, not in struct netdevice.
Proposal: move change_speed into struct netdevice, under do_ioctl
part. ifr_bandwidth just fits for our purposes.
What do you think?

PS: Other possibility is to reuse media type field. It is quite clean:
speeds do specify external interface of irda chips and if two cards
are set on different speeds, they can not talk to each other.
