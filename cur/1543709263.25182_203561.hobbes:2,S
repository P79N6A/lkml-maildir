I don't; I think this is a total joke.  The utmp issue is a more severe 
one; it might be reason to stick to the old behaviour at least for 2.6.
Linear scan of utmp and not removing entries on logout is clearly bad 
chicken.  Effectively utmp seems to be tied to the current structure, 
mostly because it tries to go beyond it -- it's so bad at doing so that 
it actually *causes* problems!
