That'd be true if fact were fiction and TV reality.
Actually, lots  of drivers  that *are* in  the kernel are  pretty much
broken.
And I don't  think putting more drivers into  the mainline kernel will
fix this problem.
The  only thing that  will is  doing stable  and development  trees in
different places. We ceased to do that, and *it's* *no* *good*.
