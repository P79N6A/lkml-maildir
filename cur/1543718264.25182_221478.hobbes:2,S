Folks,
I ran into a problem with APM on a Thinkpad T41: the system cannot
properly resume after a standby. The backlight turns on, but the
screen remains blank. This happens on keypress (fn-f3) and
idle-time-induced standbys. However, resume after "apm -S" works just
fine.
I inserted some trace statements into the apm kernel driver and found
that it does not seem to receive standby and resume notifications from
BIOS if standby is initiated through fn-f3. At the same time, it does
receive the notification on a resume from "apm -S".
Any idea why that happens?
Thanks,
Alex

P.S: I see this on a RedHat 9 system with the 2.4.20 kernel. For a
bunch of reasons, I cannot upgrade to anything else in the short
term. (I did try 2.4.26, but it behaved even worse -- didn't wake up
at all, even if standby was entered with "apm -S")
