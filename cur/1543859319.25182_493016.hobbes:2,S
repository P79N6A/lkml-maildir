1) feature-removal-schedule.txt says that it'll be removed in July 2007. 
This isn't July 2007.
2) The functionality was disabled in 2.6.19. The addition to 
feature-removal-schedule.txt was in, uh, 2.6.19.
3) "The whole _point_ of a kernel is to act as a abstraction layer and 
resource management between user programs and hardware/outside world. 
That's why kernels _exist_. Breaking user-land API's is thus by 
definition something totally idiotic.
If you need to break something, you create a new interface, and try to 
translate between the two, and maybe you deprecate the old one so that 
it can be removed once it's not in use any more. If you can't see that 
this is how a kernel should work, you're missing the point of having a 
kernel in the first place."
