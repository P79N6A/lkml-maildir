Ouch, that's bad :-(. So PXA can't keep time properly... could we do
something like storing time on system shutdown and restoring it on
bootup? That way at least time will be monotonic... Ok, that's
userland problem.
Is there way to reboot without "really" rebooting? That would help at
least in my usage case. (Also reboot really does poweroff, not reboot,
but...)
