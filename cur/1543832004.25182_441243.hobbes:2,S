I'm missing something silly here.
Before the patch, we have the following
  o Call free_area_initSOMETHING()
  o Set mem_map to NODE_DATA(0)->node_mem_map
  o At each call to page_to_pfn() or pfn_to_page(), offset mem_map by 
    ARCH_PFN_OFFSET
After the patch, we have
  o Call free_area_initSOMETHING()
  o Set mem_map to NODE_DATA(0)->node_mem_map - ARCH_PFN_OFFSET
  o At each call to page_to_pfn() or pfn_to_page(), use mem_map without 
    any additional offset
I don't see how free_area_init_node() changed except for callers 
using mem_map directly.
....
using mem_map directly. uh uh
Both of our patches are broken.
page_to_pfn() and pfn_to_page() both need ARCH_PFN_OFFSET to get PFNs,
that's fine. However, I forgot that another assumption of the FLATMEM memory
model is that mem_map[0] is the first valid struct page in the system. A
number of architectures walk mem_map[] directly (cris and frv are examples)
without offsetting based on this assumption.
This means that any patch that moves mem_map without altering every direct
user of the mem_map[] array will break further down the line. If nothing else,
this shows that ARCH_PFN_OFFSET could have done with a comment :) .
