Sorry for the ppc64 tangent, ia64 list people... :)
I'm not quite sure what's it's used for.  I *think* there's a node in
each of the fake OpenFirmware tree directories that exports a magic
resource tag that can identify the memory when it's handed back to the
hypervisor. 
We need this number exported to userspace, because we basically make the
hypervisor calls from there.  It's safe to say that I'd prefer this
method be revised at some point in the future.
