Yes:  inline functions, unless you're careful about which headers 
you use and how you use them. And you have to be very, very careful 
because which symbols turn into inline functions depends on which 
kernel options are selected, which architecture you're building for, 
minor variations between kernel versions, the phase of the moon, 
etc.  It would take tainting support in gcc itself, and that isn't 
like to happen for a variety of practical and political reasons.
