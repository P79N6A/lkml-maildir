Subject: [Suspend2][ 24/32] [Suspend2] Set extra page forward flag.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/6/26/524

Set the flag that says the next forward_one_page should actually go forward
to pages. This is used at resume time when we get the first page of the
header from the page pointed to by resume2= (bootstrapping), and then
actually want the second page at the point where we do need to get another
page.
We can't just go forward one page right away because we haven't yet
loaded the extent chain that contains the block data. But loading the
extent chain that contains the block data might need the extra page (if
badly fragmented). Catch 22, hence this flag.
