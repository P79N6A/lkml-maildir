Got an interesting one here; this combination fails to link:
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_CMD640=y
# CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEPCI is not set
Why not?  Well.. cmd640.c is in drivers/ide/pci/ which is only
entered if CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEPCI, and if CONFIG_BLK_DEV_CMD640 is set,
drivers/ide/ide.c contains a reference to cmd640_vlb which is defined
in cmd640.c.
The "obvious" solution to make CMD640 depend on IDEPCI is not correct
because of the aforementioned VLB controllers.  Maybe we could just add
the line:
obj-$(CONFIG_BLK_DEV_CMD640)            += pci/
to drivers/ide/Makefile which is a bit of a kludge..
