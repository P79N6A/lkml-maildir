Subject: [patch] no lock needed in sys_creat()

Hi Linus,
The patch below makes the code for sys_creat() as small as it needs to be.
The global kernel lock does not need to be in sys_creat() as it is taken
in sys_open() already.
It (patch) is small and simple so I hope it has a chance of your blessing.
Of course, I understand (thanks to Richard :) ) that no harm done by
taking the global kernel lock twice but the smaller the code, the better.
Regards,
