NAK!
It's pretty standard for 0xf0000...0x100000 to be marked RESERVED in 
E820 on real hardware (including the system I'm typing on right now.) 
It is so marked to indicate that hardware cannot be mapped into that 
space.  However, you can't rely on this fact -- heck, you can't rely on 
E820 even existing on a real machine.  I have specimens of real-life 
machines that go both ways.
This patch WILL break real hardware.
What's particularly damning is that it's titled "x86/xen: Do not scan 
for DMI unless the DMI region is reserved by e820." whereas in fact it 
changes (breaks) generic code.
