The network is 10 mbit, so 4 MB/sec is no good in this case.
I've got the thing running, with (ibm)setmax. Don't hang the disk in a
machine that does handle > 32 GB, because it will screw the limit the
setmax just set.

Already installed :)

Thanx. If I get anymore problems I'll switch to a Promise controller. 2
days to setup a plain Linux box is a bit much.. 
Main problem I've had is that the software clipping bugs, or that my BIOS
in teh newer machine screws things up.
