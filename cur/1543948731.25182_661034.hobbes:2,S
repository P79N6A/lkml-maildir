Please note that do_notify_parent_cldstop() needs _another_ ->siglock,
the parent's one. We drop target's one because we can't take both, this
is deadlockable.

Well, yes and no. Yes, it postpones signalling, but actually it removes
these do_notify_parent_cldstop()'s from the senfer path completely.
Instead, this task itself (the reciever) should notify the parent.
I am still not sure this doesn't have some fundamental problems, at least
I need to think more... Actually, I hope Roland will shed a light ;)
Hmm... Can't we make a simpler patch for the start? See below.
We can notify the parent earlier, before waking the TASK_STOPPED
child. This should fix this race, no?
Oleg.
