Subject: no console with current (bk) kernel

From my .config:
# CONFIG_FB is not set
CONFIG_VT=y
CONFIG_VT_CONSOLE=y
CONFIG_HW_CONSOLE=y
CONFIG_VGA_CONSOLE=y
CONFIG_VIDEO_SELECT=y
and yet the boot fails with a complaint that it cannot open a
console, followed by a reboot.  (Too fast to copy anything down.)
Box is p3 notebook, gcc is 3.3.2 (gentoo -r5).
What am I missing?
