Hi,
I really do appreciate your work for the LinuX Kernel. But nowadays, 
with the 2.6.x Kernel I'm not able to use my USB - WLAN Adapter (D-LINK 
DWL-120).
Pluggin' into the USB port leads to an error in Kernel, so it's not 
recognized as a device either (with lsusb, the device can't be seen). 
That has to be a problem in the Kernel, because it should be recognized 
as a "unknown" device, if it has no driver, right?
Are you needing more information?
Please answer rapidly...!
 Thanks in advance,
sincereley 
MARTIN
