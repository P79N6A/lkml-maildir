Okay, the patch applied easily and the kernel is now compiling. When 
installed, I'll try and boot it (and will use a PS/2 mouse instead of my 
current USB mouse, or should I rather try to plug my USB mouse to the 
ehci_hcd controller ?).
How would you like me to boot ? With or without the "usb-handoff" option ? 
With or without the BIOS "USB mouse support" option ?
And once booted, what information will you be interested in ?
