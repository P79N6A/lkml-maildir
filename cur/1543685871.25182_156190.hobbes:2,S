I did some more digging, and, after a week of experimentation and 
searching, I finally found the solution. This message tells it all:

IIRC there were some versions of glibc in Debian which activated the 686
and higher optimized versions for the cmov-less Ezra. A workaround is to
(re)move /usr/lib/686.

==============
Mandrake 9.1 has the exact same problem, but the extension directory is 
found in /lib/i686. I ran the following command:
mv /lib/i686 /lib/i686.invalid
and everything worked.
I am not sure why 2.6 activated this issue in glibc, where 2.4.21 
didn't. Perhaps this should be noted on the Halloween document?
I thank everyone that offered their assistance.
