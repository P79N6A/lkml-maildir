Ah.  But it looks like you only patched the ramdisk loader, I did
the bootloader also.  My intention is that it would be used as a
replacement for the gzip thoughout, the kernel I have on tomsrtbt
2.0.88 does the bzip2 kernel load and bzip2 ramdisk load, and does
not include the gzip code at all.
As for figures-
I have only tested with bzip2 -9, and my patch only supports small
(not fast), (remember that I'm coming from a floppy diskette...).
I'm aiming for compression then memory then speed, so, I don't have
numbers for what bzip2 -1 or fast-RLE would be like.  Moreover, the
tomsrtbt is loading a 4MB ramdisk from a 1.722 floppy, so I'm not
testing memory usage beyond pass/fail on an 8MB machine.
In _my_ configuration, (tomsrtbt 2.0.88), the numbers (to the best
accuracy I have, using the current best measure I have performed):
Size:
             gzip    bzip2    savings
Kernel     862209   831381      30828
Ramdisk    939474   880756      58718
           ______   ______      _____
Total     1801683  1712137      89546
              Speed    Memory
Gzip      Lightning   Thimble
Bzip2      Molasses   Bathtub
