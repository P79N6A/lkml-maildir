Well as I said - I haven't seen any requirement for this expressed.  That
doesn't mean that such a requirements doesn't exist, of course.

Is that useful?   If you need a new subarch_bar() then
a) Implement it in the subarch which needs it
b) Implement an attribute(weak) stub in a new subarch-stubs.c
c) call it.
That's a little more costly than a static inline stub, but not much.  Are
there likely to be any subarch calls which are a) called frequently and b)
not required on some subarchs?

Why would one need that?  Isn't it simply a matter of renaming
machine_halt() to subarch_machine_halt() everywhere?
I'm just looking for the simplest option here.  Eric has identified a code
maintainability problem - it'd be good to fix that, but we shouldn't add
runtime cost/complexity unless we actually gain something from it.
