After struggling with totally broken kernels for the whole morning I got the 
HPET to work with my NForce4 with the following hard coded ACPI quirk. My 
machine has been now stable for few hours and I tested that the HPET really 
seems to be working by switching the clock source using
echo hpet|tsc|acpi_pm > /sys/devices/system/clocksource/clocksource0/current_clocksource
Results of a simple benchmark show that the time to execute gettimeofday 
really varies based on the clock source: (performance normalised to tsc)
tsc:      1x
hpet:     4x
acpi_pm: 12x
At least on my motherboard it seems to be enough to just grab the HPET address 
from the lspci output and not bother with any of the other changing bits.
