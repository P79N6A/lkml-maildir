Hi all ,
I've recently switched from an MSI KT4 Ultra motherboard to an Abit KV7 
board ,and the system worked well until today that I'm attempting to 
reinstall the system .
It seems that the USB make some conflicts in IRQ , infact , if I enable 
the option "Allocate IRQ to USB" in the BIOS , I'm unable to start any 
Installation CD of any distribution , the booting simply hangup .
This doesn't happen if I've APIC and ACPI enabled , but if I use the 
PCI-BIOS mode this happens (nearly all Linux distributions start the 
system installation without APIC and ACPI ). FreeBSD and NetBSD hasn't 
this problem , and both those boot without problem and with USB enabled .
If I disable the option "Allocate IRQ to USB" in the BIOS the system 
boot up correctly .
Any ideas?
Thanks
Marcello
