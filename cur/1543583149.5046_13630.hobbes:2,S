What is wrong with making methods, keyed off of the ethernet protocol
ID, that can do the "I know where/how-long headers are" stuff for that
protocol?  Only cards with the problem call into this function vector
or however we arrange it, and then for those that don't have these
problems at all we can make NULL a special value for this
"post-header" pointer.
You can pick some arbitrary number, sure, that is another way to
do it.  Such a size would need to be chosen very carefully though.
