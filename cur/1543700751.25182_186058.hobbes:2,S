 Thanks! Never throught. I could come up with this:
find . -name Kconfig| xargs grep --colour 'depends.* SCSI'
(Execute in the kernel tree, and replace SCSI with whatever you like;
may help others with similar questions).

 IMHO it's either:
serio-04-synaptics-cleanup.patch
serio-06-synaptics-use-reconnect.patch
synaptics-powerpro-fix.patch
serio-pm-fix.patch
input-02-add-psmouse_proto.patch (?)
input-05-psmouse-fixes.patch
input-07-remove-synaptics-config-option.patch (maybe?)
input-08-synaptics-protocol-discovery.patch
Thus meanwhile I try to revert them. Anyway, as -mm1 is already bigger,
is it possible that you release 2.6.1 in this year with some/most of the
fixes in mm1?
