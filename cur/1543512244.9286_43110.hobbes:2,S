it solves my device naming and it is quite up to snuff.  for the last X months,
the largest changes in the devfs patch are syncing it with the current source
code of the kernel.

it's been two years in the works.  and issues are really trivial.  i've used
devfs in production for just shy of a year now and none of my production
machines has ever suffered from an issue related to devfs.  i have a singular
machine that sits on the shelf that i had a problem with an IDE tape drive a
long time ago and haven't had time to dust it off and solve the problem ..if
the problem even exists today.

and it's doing one heck of a great job, and as i've purported before, it is a
step in the right direction.  i'd rather take that step than let moss grow.
