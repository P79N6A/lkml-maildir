We've *always* had to do this; that's what "chmod -R" or "setfacl -R"  
are for :-D.  The major problem is that the locking and lookup  
overhead gets really significant if you have to look at the entire  
directory tree in order to determine the permissions for one single  
object.  I definitely agree that we need better GUIs for managing  
file permissions, but I don't see how you could modify the kernel in  
this case to do what you want.

So what would you have happen when you move another directory into  
that directory?  Should it retain its permissions?  If they change  
based on the new directory then do you recurse into each  
subdirectory?  Such recursing to modify permissions also has  
significant performance implications.  What about if the file is  
hardlinked elsewhere; do those permissions change?
There's also the question of what to do about namespaces and bind  
mounts.  If I run "mount --bind /foo /home/foo", then do I get  
different file permissions depending on what path I access the file  
by?  What if I then run chroot("/foo"), do I get different file  
permissions then?  What if I have two namespaces, each with their own  
root filesystem (say "root1" and "root2"), and I mount the other  
namespace's root filesystem in a subdir of each:
   NS1:  mount /dev/root2 /otherns
   NS2:  mount /dev/root1 /otherns
Now I have the following paths to the same file, do these get  
different permissions or the same?
   NS1:/foo == NS2:/otherns/foo
   NS2:/bar == NS1:/otherns/bar
If you answered that they get different permissions, then how do you  
handle the massive locking performance penalty due to the extra  
lookups?  If you answered "same permissions", then how do you explain  
the obvious discrepancy to the admin?

The idea is nice, but as soon as you add multiple namespaces,  
chroots, or bind mounts the concept breaks down.  For security- 
sensitive things like file permissions, you really do want  
determinate behavior regardless of the path used to access the data.
