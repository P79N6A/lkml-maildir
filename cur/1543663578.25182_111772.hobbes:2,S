Hello,
I've done some changes in the kernel sock struct (made a flag word, 
replacing some volatile char varibles) and I wish to send the patch to 
someone that can check it out, but I've no idea
for which mail should I send it. Can someone tell me a mail for where 
should I send the patch?
(The patch is anexed in this mail)
Regards,
Pedro Hortas
