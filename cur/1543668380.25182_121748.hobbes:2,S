The journal recovery rangers from slow to really friggin slow under
2.5.66 with definate pauses in disk io stretching for 10s of seconds.
This does not happen with 2.5.63 and if I hit ^c on fsck and let the
kernel handle the journal recover for all partitions  on mountime
the recovery under 2.5.66 is either so fast that you don't notice
it or just a buttload faster. Very objective measurements of time but
the slowness of a journal recover as done by fsck is so noticible it's
not funny.
At the time of fsck journal recover or moiunt-time kernel journal
recover DMA is turned on the drive.
e2fsprogs 1.27 is in use. (1.27-2 from debian woody)
