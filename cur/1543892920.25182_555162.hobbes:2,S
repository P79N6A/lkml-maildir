Sigh.  Is this some sort of contest to see how many things we can
do wrong in a single patch?
- Include a changelog
- Include Signed-off-by:
- Don't use attachments
- If you _must_ use attachments, use text/plain, not application/octet-stream
- Format code to remain within 80 columns.
- Don't do "if(".  Do "if ("
Oh well.  Good to hear that the oops got fixed, thanks.
