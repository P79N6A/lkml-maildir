Would you mind to stop your general accusations against "other distributions"
and your talking for people (i.e. authors) that you don't know or haven't
talked to in your whole lifetime.
Fortunately everybody can decide for himself what distro he likes best. And if
someone thinks he has to modify the original GPL source, then he should do.
If you don't like that, don't use GPL, because the right to modify foreign
sources is a major part of it.
