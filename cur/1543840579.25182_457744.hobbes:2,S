It breaks powerpc build as poewrpc does not seem to be defining symbol
_text which is used by arch independent kallsyms.c. Attached is the one
line fix.
Thanks
Vivek
o ppc64 does not seem to be defining symbol _text  which is used by
  kernel/kallsyms.c for relocatable kernel patches. Instead of absolute
  symbol addresses now it is stored as offset from symbol _text
  (_text + offset) so that relocations entries for this section are
  generated, if need be. (currently i386 will be the only user once
  the relocatable kernel patches are merged).
