Quite right. I read it too quickly and thought it had succeeded when  
it had failed. I will modify the module to do the shared IRQ and then  
try the noapic test again. Exactly why I reserved the right to do it  
again.
This is good because it means the hammer may work after all.
Thank you very much and I will post to let you know the outcome.
