Hmmm, do you understand how broken the sparc hardware is? :-)
Seriously, the issue is that the MMU writes back access/dirty bits
asynchronously, does not do a relookup when it writes these bits back
into the PTE (like x86 and others do) it actually stores away the PTE
physical address and writes into the PTE using that, and finally as
previously mentioned we lack a cmpxchg we only have raw SWAP.
Keith W. can verify this, he has my old SuperSPARC manual which explains
all of this stuff.  Keith you might want to quote that little "atomic PTE
update sequence" piece of code that's in the manual for Linus.
