Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but wouldn't these #defines be a problem with 
the new HZ flexibility:
#define	CCID_DRIVER_BULK_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT  	(150*HZ)
#define	CCID_DRIVER_ASYNC_POWERUP_TIMEOUT 	(35*HZ)
#define	CCID_DRIVER_MINIMUM_TIMEOUT 		(3*HZ)
#define READ_WRITE_BUFFER_SIZE 512
#define POLL_LOOP_COUNT				1000
/* how often to poll for fifo status change */
#define POLL_PERIOD 				(HZ/100)
In particular, 2.6.13 allows a HZ of 100, which would define POLL_PERIOD to 0. 
Your later calls to mod_timer would be setting cmx_poll_timer to the current 
value of jiffies. 
Also, you've got a typo in the comments:
* 	- adhere to linux kenrel coding style and policies
Forgive me if I'm way off - I'm just now getting my feet wet in kernel 
development. Just making comments based on what I (think) I know at this 
point.
Best Regards,
