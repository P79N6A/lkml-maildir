Ahh, no.
A SMP kernel (or one with UP IO-APIC) is not going to be helpful for this,
actually. SMP will take the irq data from the MP block, not the pirq table
(that can be considered something of a misfeature right now, but getting
the mixture of PCI irq redirection from the MP tables and the pirq irq
routing information right together is probably not worth it - especially
as I don't think any MS OS has ever done that either, so the BIOS writers
have never experienced that combination - so it's almost guaranteed to
result in strange results).
