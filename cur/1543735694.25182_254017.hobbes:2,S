I am having what appears to be IDE DMA problems with 2.6.9-rc2-mm1-S1.
2.6.9-rc2-mm1 does not show this problem and runs fine. Before this I
was happily using 2.6.8-rc3-O5.
I tried booting with acpi=off but was unable to enter my user name at
the login prompt, it just hung with no response to sysreq. I also tried
turning off irq threading for that irq but it made no difference.
There is one drive on the secondary channel of this Promise TX133. This
is what appears in the log after a minute or two of using the drive.
hdg: dma_timer_expiry: dma status == 0x24
PDC202XX: Secondary channel reset.
hdg: DMA interrupt recovery
hdg: lost interrupt
hdg: dma_timer_expiry: dma status == 0x24
PDC202XX: Secondary channel reset.
hdg: DMA interrupt recovery
hdg: lost interrupt
hdg: dma_timer_expiry: dma status == 0x24
PDC202XX: Secondary channel reset.

i'm getting the same problem
(although not sure if the dma status was the same)
if i enable hardirq preemption
turning acpi on/off doesn't change anything
io/up apic is on (haven't tried disabling it)
with hardirq preemption disabled in .config
everything looks fine sofar (~5h )

----------------------------
this puzzles me a bit
aren't those hardirqs ?
why are they listed as threads, in case i compiled
with 
----------------
[svetljo@svetljo rc2mm1]$ grep PREEMPT .config
# CONFIG_PREEMPT_TIMING is not set
CONFIG_PREEMPT=y
CONFIG_PREEMPT_VOLUNTARY=y
CONFIG_PREEMPT_SOFTIRQS=y
# CONFIG_PREEMPT_HARDIRQS is not set
----------------
best,
svetljo
