Hello Linus,
  attached patch must be applied to 2.2.3-pre[1-3] Jakub Jelinek's
scrollback code, which come to you through Geert Uytterhoeven. Without
attached patch (which is included in JJ code, but not in GU video patch
for you), if you hit Shift-PgUp with logo on screen, machine dies (due
to recursive invocation of
fbcon_scrolldelta->update_region->hide_cursor->fbcon_cursor->
->fbcon_set_origin->fbcon_scrolldelta).
  It happens because of scrollback code is not able to handle logo
together with scrolling back - so it tries to disable logo when you start
scrolling back, but there was bug in logo-hide procedure :-(
  I hoped that JJ and/or Geert sent it to you last week, but as I see they
did not, so here is a patch. After that, you can press Shift-PgUp freely
(at least here).
                       Best regards and sorry for inconvience,
                                        Petr Vandrovec
