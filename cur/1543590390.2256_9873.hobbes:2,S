Page tuning can fix that.  (Have the compiler & linker increase locality
by stuffing related code in the same page.  You want fast paths
stuffed into as few pages as possible, regardless of which functions
the instructions belong to.)  This also cut down on swapping and TLB
misses.
Os/2 gained some nice speedups by doing this.

They can be page tuned too, and they're often partially in
memory aready when starting apps.

Putting several in a single file, or even the executable will
help here.
