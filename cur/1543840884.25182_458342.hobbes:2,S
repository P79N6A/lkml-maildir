I tried to do a check on the alignment, and only do the whole transfer
as a block with memcpy_toio if it was 32bit aligned.  It breaks the same
way no matter how it is aligned.  It really seems that somehow using
this __memcpy assembly block on the geode sc1200 doesn't work correctly.
Doing the call using a loop with d2=1 works fine, but anything bigger
seems broken.
