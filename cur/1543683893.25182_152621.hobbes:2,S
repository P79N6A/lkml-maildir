But it's not possible to determine realtimeness automatically, as far as I 
know.

That's precisely what Davide's SCHED_SOFTRR is and does.

On the other hand, you want to avoid messing up the kernel just because some 
app is broken.  While it's not always possible to avoid changing apps to fix 
them, in the case of audio apps on Linux at this point in time, it most 
certainly is.
