Well, if you look at the typical problem systems today, you
will see that most of the pages being allocated and evicted
are in the page cache, while most of the pages in memory are
actually anonymous pages.
Not having to scan over that 80% of memory that contains
anonymous pages and shared memory segments to get at the
20% page cache pages is much more than a factor two
improvement.

Replacing page cache pages is easy.  If they were referenced
once (typical), we can just evict the page the first time we
scan it.
Anonymous pages have a similar optimization: every anonymous
page starts out referenced, so moving referenced pages back
to the front of the active list is unneeded work.
However, we cannot just place referenced anonymous pages onto
an inactive list that is shared with page cache pages, because
of the difference in replacement cost and relative importance
of both types of pages!
