I still think we should rename _bh thing :). At least for consistent naming.
We have things like:
         in_softirq()
         do_softirq()
         sofirq_pending()
and
         local_bh_disable()
         local_bh_enable()
Anyway, I'll go ahead and shut up :). Most people didn't seem to like that 
proposal :(.
