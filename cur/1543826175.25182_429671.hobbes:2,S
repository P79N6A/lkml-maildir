If the stats package is up to scratch it will provide stats for tasks 
that have exited so you will be able to charge their resource usage to 
the higher level entity and still manage that entity's usage properly 
via its other tasks.

Or Xen.  Or Vmware.  That would be one solution and brings other 
functionality that may be desirable.  Of course, you can also do 
resource control within those instances as well :-).
