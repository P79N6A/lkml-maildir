A better long term solution would be not to change the ops structure
but to copy and chain it, as I did in my experimental cswitch patches.
The approach I took allows for a new fake event which can be selected
at runtime with --event instead of with a boot option.
But for now I don't see any drama with leaving in the ->setup() and
->shutdown() methods when rewriting the ops structure.  Ditto for
the ->create_files() methods.
