Hmm. You may be taken care of by one of the exceptions already in
dmi_scan.c, and it'd be interesting (and useful) to find out. If you've
got a few minutes, could you open up arch/i386/kernel/dmi_scan.c and
either uncomment or add the line:
   #define dmi_printk(x) printk x
after the existing "#define dmi_printk(x)".
With that, upon boot the new kernel will show the BIOS version and date,
which dmesg will show. If they are one of: 
  R0203Z3  08/25/00
  R0203D0  05/12/00
  R0121Z1  05/11/00
  R0208P1  11/09/00
...then in fact your BIOS also gets it wrong, which would be
aesthetically pleasing in a sort of perverted way.
