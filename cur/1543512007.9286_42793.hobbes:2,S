i'm seeing the either same problem or something similar and can reproduce it
fairly easily.
configuration:
pentium 75 laptop, linksys 10/100+56k modem (pcnet_cs)
redhat 5.2 userspace
2.2.12 stock kernel
ppp built and loaded as a module
pcmcia 3.1.1 (also happens with 3.0.14)
mtu/mru set to 1500 
what appears to happen (via kdebug from pppd) is that it receives an oversize
packet (1506) which then causes it to have all of the subsequent frames fail
fcs.
