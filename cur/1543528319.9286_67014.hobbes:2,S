Probably because the only reason Microsoft put this into W2k is that there
is so much file duplication that they're desperate to find a way to reduce
it.  Win2k's MINIMUM INSTALLATION SIZE is 1 gb (!) and they know that
people aren't going to stand for that type of thing for very much longer.
In the Unix world, this type of thing is much less of a problem, so there
was never such a need for this type of utility.
