   Kernel configuration appears correct, I have
'end_that_request_..._Rxxxxxxxx' in /proc/ksyms and all other modules
load. It's only the block modules (floppy, nbd, ide-floppy, ide-cd, loop)
that are troublesome.

   The modules are built from the strait from the 2.2.13 source tree. I
have also recompiled the kernel. The only patch I've applied is the
reiserfs support and I didn't have the problems then. It seems to be only
since I've changed to gcc-2.95.2 and glibc-2.1.2 that I've had problems. 
  I haven't had trouble accessing the devices when the abovementioned
block modules are compiled directly into the kernel.
   I've removed all old modules from the system and have recreated the
/lib/modules directory numerous times. At all times only the block modules
fail to load. All other kernel modules load without problems.
   Thanks for the info.
