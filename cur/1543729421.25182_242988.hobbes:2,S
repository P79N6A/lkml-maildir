I run Slackware 10 and got this in /etc/udev/permissions.d/udev.permissions :
# console devices
console:root:tty:0600
tty:root:tty:0666
tty[0-9][0-9]*:root:tty:0660
vc/[0-9]*:root:tty:0660
But the real problem is not permissions but the fact that /dev/tty is
a directory now not a character device. Is this intended? If yes this
will break many userspace applications which will assume /dev/tty is a
character device. Greg can you please comment?
Cheers,
