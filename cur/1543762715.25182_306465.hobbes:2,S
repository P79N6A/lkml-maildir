PREEMPT_BKL has been in mainline since 2.6.11-rc1,  preempt_schedule_irq
made it in 2.6.11-rc3. Please look here:

For i386 the first change was to switch to preempt_schedule in this code
path: 
http://linux.bkbits.net:8080/linux-2.6/patch@1.1966.39.63
preempt_schedule takes care of setting PREEMPT_ACTIVE and resetting it
afterwards, so I removed that from the assembler code.
Then preempt_schedule_irq has been introduced to move the sti/cli back
around the call to schedule:
http://linux.bkbits.net:8080/linux-2.6/patch@1.1982.28.91
So in the end the only thing that the patch I proposed was doing is to
*additionally* handle the PREEMPT_BKL case so that schedule doesn't
accidentally release the BKL semaphore when it shouldn't because we are
preempting and nobody explicitly called schedule.
Several other archs have done the same. No bug has shown up until the
recent -mm kernel where the execution of this code path actually became
possible (the "jc -> jnc" fix some lines above).

These things are in 2.6.11 (except that they never got called because of
the wrong interrupt flag check in the IRQ handler).

Well, nobody minds if I play with a webserver in the middle of the
night, as long as it works during the day. Shoot me. :)
Both servers are running fine since I applied my patch last night.
Now that I looked into it I think that it's obviously the correct
solution.
