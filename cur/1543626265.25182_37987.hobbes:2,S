See Documentation/filesystems/porting
BKL had been shifted inside several methods, so that filesystem code itself
had the same locking as it used to (i.e. code that used to be under BKL
stayed under it).  If your code doesn't need BKL - feel free to shrink the
area, but keep in mind that it used to be under BKL.
I didn't _add_ BKL - neither in devfs nor anywhere else.  lock_kernel() is
the boundary of the protected area and all that had happened is that this
area had slightly shrunken, so its boundaries are inside the method instead
of being around its caller.
Again, further shrinking is up to maintainers of the filesystems.
While we are at it, the changes in question had happened quite a couple
of months ago - none of them in 2.5.7...
