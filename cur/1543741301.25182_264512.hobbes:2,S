Subject: how to generate bk changeset summary?

When linux releases a new version, he includes a list of the changeset 
descriptions.  How is that list generated?  I'm looking to do this between 
particular kernel versions, and I figured it'd be easier doing it that way than 
trying to piece together his lists.
Thanks,
Chris
