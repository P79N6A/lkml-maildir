I have just pushed out a git tree which actually has the root-mounting 
code removed from the kernel.  Since there are any number of strange 
boot configurations out there, I would really appreciate any help in 
testing this stuff out.
I have *NOT* implemented support for the following, which I'm hoping has 
fallen out of use by now:
	-> Setting boot flags via rdev, as opposed to on the command
  	   line
	-> When loading the ramdisk from a block device, stop and
	   ask the user for a second disk.  This one could probably
	   be implemented without too much trouble if people actually
  	   care.
