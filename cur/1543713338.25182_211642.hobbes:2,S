The documentation is out of date. Basically, the createdev.sh script isn't
needed anymore because of relayfs. You need to mount relayfs to use LTT.
See the classic dox on filesystem mounting for this kind of thing. It's
going to be something like:
# mount -t relayfs nodev /mnt/relay
There's no insmod for LTT. It isn't a device driver module, following LKML
recommendations.
As for RTAI, there's currently no RTAI support in relayfs. If you want to have
RTAI tracing, then you'd have to fall back on earlier stable versions of LTT.

Sure.
