No. I didn't time `make modules`, only `make bzImage`.
`make modules` takes too long to time (really) I don't
want to use any CPU resources which will screw up the
timing and I need to use the computer.
A wall-clock guess is that `make modules` takes about
an hour on the new system while it takes about 4 minutes
on the old. The new kernel build procedure is truly
horrible for the wall-clock time that is used.
For oranges vs oranges, if I compile Version 2.4.26
on a version 2.6.8 OS computer, the compile-time
is within tens of seconds. I'm not complaining about
the resulting kernel code performance, only the
abortion^M^M^M^M^M^Mjunk used to create a new kernel.
It 'make' won't do it, we have a problem and make
needs to be fixed.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
