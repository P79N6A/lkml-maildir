Nobody seems interested in the spinlock bugs in usb so I'm trying to 
track it down myself.  I have a copy of an oops (posted earlier) but it 
doesn't give the line number of the error, so it's impossible to find 
out where it's failing.
Will kdb be any help?  Is it a source debugger or just a glorified hex 
editor?   I need to be able to break into the kernel and single step 
through the calls to work out what is going on.
I'm really out of my depth trying to debug this, but I hate having to 
boot a UP kernel just to use usb.
