Hi,
2.4.10 + the ppp patch works fine on UP - if you need the SMP you can hack/patch
socket.c to "make" PPP SMP safe (the patch below works perfectly well for me on
a 2 CPU P-III system for 6 days now -- no lockups, no crashes - and I'm loading
the system constantly w/ up to 4000 PPPoX sessions, starting stopping etc... -
NO PROBLEM.)
Please keep in mind - the folling is a HACK!
Cheers,
Immanuel
