I now did the benchmarks for the same -rc6 with hpa's 4-byte stubs
too. Same machine. It's significantly better than the other two
options in terms of speed. It takes about 7% less cpu to handle
the interrupts. (0.64% cpu instead of 0.69%.) I have to run now,
I'll let interpreting the histogram to someone else ;).
