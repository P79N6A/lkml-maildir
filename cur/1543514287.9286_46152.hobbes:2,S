Agreed. For now, I will however wait to hear if this has a chance to make it
in the kernel or not before I do anymore coding :-)

While I liked the verbosity, since it gave more details, I do like your idea
now. After all, for this to be truly effective, one should have a user space
daemon that reads syslog and displays the info in an X box. That user daemon
can indeed display more info without the kernel needing to be more verbose.

I can  also add  a few  more comments in  the source,  for people  who don't
understand and look for where the message came from.
