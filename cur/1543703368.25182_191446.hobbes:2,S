Hi Ross,
I feel that I should clarify your point here as I've got a bit confused myself 
as to which patch does what, etc!
I compiled 2.6.0-test11-mm1 with IOAPIC and APIC support (never had used these 
options before). Within minutes I met my first lockup ever on this PC. (This 
kernel included the other recent nforce2 patches: 
nforce2-disconnect-quirk.patch and +nforce2-apic.patch)
I then tried your patches with default settings, and I thought that the 
problem was solved, as you can see in the URL you referenced. That was a false 
alarm, I did then meet another lockup a few hours later, and another one a few 
hours after that. I then reverted out the nforce2-disconnect-quirk patch (as 
per your suggestion), and started booting with the apic_tack=2 argument.
See: 
http://linux.derkeiler.com/Mailing-Lists/Kernel/2003-12/5259.html
No lockups since then, but I have been experiencing the clock skew.
But, there might be more to it. I had forgotten up until now, but I am using 
this code in my /etc/conf.d/local.start :
setpci -v -H1 -s 0:0.0 6F=$(printf %x $((0x$(setpci -H1 -s 0:0.0 6F) | 0x10)))
and this one in /etc/conf.d/local.stop :
setpci -v -H1 -s 0:0.0 6F=$(printf %x $((0x$(setpci -H1 -s 0:0.0 6F) & 0xef)))
I got these codes from 
http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Athlon-Powersaving-HOWTO/approaches.html#commandline
 
a while back - they are supposed to enable powersaving and make your CPU run 
cooler. I ran a test when I originally started using this, and I did find that 
my CPU ran cooler when idle after I had ran these commands.
I don't know if this would influence my systems behaviour with/without the 
various patches that have been flying around.. but I hope you can make some 
sense out of it and continue bugging AMD/nvidia!

I'd certainly investigate a different type of chipset on my next board, if I 
knew of a manufacturer that they *would* approach issues like this one out in 
the open...
