It's fairly complex.  Let's just summerise it as "yenta texas instruments
IRQ routing fucked up" 8)  The chip has a bunch of registers to control
what signals get routed to which physical pins, and it seems that between
June 2002 and today, some bad changes happened.  I'm currently trying to
track down each one, but, as there have been several levels of patching
going on, it isn't simple.

Yep, and I'm going to fix them as part of my present work.
Think about what happens to ->init with the current system when you
have two different cardbus controllers in the same machine.
