That would be good.
If it isn't happening in a significant quantity, then something else
must be responsible for the performance increase. Arjan guesses the
double wakeups which could be the case, but I'd still put my money
on this issue (or maybe it is a combination of both).
Either way it would be good to work out where the performance is
coming from, and I do think fixing this is a good idea for fairness
(even though it may not technically improve deterministic max
latencies because there are still race windows)
