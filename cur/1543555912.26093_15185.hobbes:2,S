Hello!
      I am trying to recompile my kernel after adding
some patches... After making the changes, I first run
make dep and then make clean...both run fine. However,
after running make bzImage it gives me the following
errors:
make[2]: *** [ksyms.o] Error 1
make[2]: Leaving directory
`/usr/src/linux-2.2.16/kernel'
make[1]: *** [first_rule] Error 2
make[1]: Leaving directory
`/usr/src/linux-2.2.16/kernel'
make: *** [_dir_kernel] Error 2                      
I was not able to figure out what may be causing this
problem. Can some one please help me out with this
one?
Thank you very much
Kaustubh
