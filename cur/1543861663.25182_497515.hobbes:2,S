 Looks nicely done, but I query the postal address changes in
Documentation/cdrom/sbpcd - that seems to be a change of address
(without anything to explain it).  Everything else seems to be just
character-set conversion or the occasional translation of comments
into English.  (And no, I didn't attempt to review the character-set
changes, even it there is an occasional error it will be better than
where we are now, and easy to patch.)

 I prefer the AltGr dead keys in X (they seem to work more reliably
for me), but I guess I'm straying OT.
