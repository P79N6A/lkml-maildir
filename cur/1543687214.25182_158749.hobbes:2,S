And these other systems are broken.  (actually, older Cisco equipment
correctly responds to the ARP regardless of source IP)
Just because some Cisco engineer says that it is correct doesn't
make it is.
Consider the situation logically.  When you're replying to an
ARP, _HOW_ do you know what IP addresses are assigned to _MY_
outgoing interfaces and _HOW_ do you know what subnets _EXIST_
on the LAN?
The answer to both is, you'd don't know these things _EVEN_ if
you are a router/gateway.
Therefore there is no valid reason not to respond to an ARP using one
source address as opposed to another.
