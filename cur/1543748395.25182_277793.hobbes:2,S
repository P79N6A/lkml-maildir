Another odd crash, this time with PREEMPT_RT and 32-5.
Was trying to download 32-12 using mozilla and saw the following:
 - the download window came up with ?? of ?? downloaded
 - at this point, mozilla was not responsive, could move windows
with the window manager but no updates to the window contents.
 - top showed no CPU usage for mozilla-bin
Tried alt-sysrq-L (was then going to do -D) and got the following
messages on the serial console...
SysRq : (          IRQ 1-278  |#0): new 2304 us maximum-latency critical
section.
[stack dump shown]
(          IRQ 1-278  |#0): new 374313 us maximum-latency critical section.
[stack dump shown]
(          IRQ 1-278  |#0): new 374868 us maximum-latency critical section.
[stack dump shown]
(          IRQ 1-278  |#0): new 374923 us maximum-latency critical section.
[stack dump shown]
At this point, the system is non responsive. Network operations had
stopped, no mouse / display updates, no response to keyboard commands
like Alt-SysRq keys. Never saw the output of Alt-SysRq-L on the serial
console. The system log did not have anything either, its last message
was the one noting that I had logged in for the day.
Let me know if you need the serial console output.
