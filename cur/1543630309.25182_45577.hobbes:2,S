Oops. Indeed I see now that the ide_lock is exported to
the upper layers above it in ide-probe.c
blk_init_queue(q, do_ide_request, &ide_lock);
But this is problematic in itself, since it means that
we are basically serialiazing between *all* requests
on all channels.
So I think we should have per channel locks on this level
right? This is anyway our unit for serialization.
(I'm just surprised that blk_init_queue() doesn't
provide queue specific locking and relies on exported
locks from the drivers...)
