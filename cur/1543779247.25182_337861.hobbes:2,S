which patch have you tested? The mail you replied to above is for patch
#2, while on SMT/HT boxes it's patch #3 that is the correct approach.
furthermore, which base kernel have you applied the patch to? Best would 
be to test the following kernels:
 2.6.13-rc4 + sched-rollup
 2.6.13-rc4 + sched-rollup + better-wake-balance-#3
the sched-rollup and the latest better-wake-balance patches can be found 
at:
  
http://redhat.com/~mingo/scheduler-patches/
(sched-rollup is the current scheduler patch-queue in -mm. And if you 
have time, it would also be nice to have a 2.6.13-rc4 baseline for 
VolanoMark, and perhaps a 2.6.12 measurement too, so that we can see how 
things changed.)
