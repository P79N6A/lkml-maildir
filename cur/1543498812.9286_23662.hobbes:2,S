Hi Keith,
All right -- when I get my box back I will write this patch up.  I'm
glad to hear it's only 29 flaky lines.
My first rule about dependencies, as with any other programming,
is that they have to be correct.  I care about missing dependencies
(because they are a correctness failure) and I don't care about
extra dependencies (because they are an efficiency problem at worst).

Sure.  define_bool does that.
I've given up on "cleanup patches" for most things, though.  At any
given moment, the kernel code has a lot of loose edges in it.  I think
it's more productive to go after ancient kbuild subsystems rather than
chase subtle configuration bugs in the corpus of the code.
