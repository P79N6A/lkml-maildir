I'm thinking specifically of the case where the application is using
some fancy user space locking scheme of its own to guarantee safe read
access to a part of the file that is known to have changed on the
server.
We do have fadvise(POSIX_FADV_DONTNEED), which gets you most of the way.
However that calls invalidate_mapping_pages(), which only clears
unlocked pages. This again means that kernel activities like readahead
or VM scanning can cause pages the user would otherwise like to eject to
be preserved.
The other alternative is to use O_DIRECT file access, but that forces
the application to handle caching and readahead in user space too.
