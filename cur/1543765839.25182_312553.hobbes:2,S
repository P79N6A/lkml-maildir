The only two ways I can see this happening are (1) if the process is running
as uid 0 (or capability-equivalent) at fork() time and have called set*uid()
before execve(), or (2) we just exec'ed a set-UID binary.
In both cases the "obvious" thing to do is to re-check the target UID's rlimit,
but there may be some squirrelly corner case where this isn't true...
