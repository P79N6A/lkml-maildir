We are running IA-32 binaries on IPF machines using a SW translator.
We have problems with binaries that are non-readable ( it's 
execute-only not read-only. sorry for the misleading subject line )
that reside on an NFS drive. There is no way for the translator
to load these files, even if it had root permissions, because these
permissions are squashed on the remote drive; so giving the translator
setuid/root permissions does not work.
Thanks,
Yoav.
