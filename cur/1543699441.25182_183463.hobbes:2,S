Hi,
I am still relatively new at kernel builds, but I have done a google 
search and tried to follow the process of: make distclean dep vmlinux 
modules modules_install
I have source trees for:
  2.4.20-8d,
2.4.22-2f,
2.4.23-pre5-ben0
Somehow the kernel version in the core Makefile is always: VERSION 2, 
PATCHLEVEL 4, SUBLEVEL 23 EXTRAVERSION -pre5-ben0
When I try to run my prebuilt kernels, the kernelversion info (uname 
-r) is 2.4.23-pre5-ben0
I can't update this value in the Makefile without it getting written 
over from somewhere during the make dep vmlinux process.
i) Where should I put in the kernel source tree an explicit source 
number for the kernel I'm building?
ii) Is there a tool to explicitly set a version string inside a vmlinux 
kernel?
iii) originally, I was just copying configuration information by 
copying .config files from one source directory to another and 
rebuilding. Did I somehow copy kernel version information withit?
iv) is there an option inside make menuconfig to set the kernel's 
version number?
v) when I do a make modules_install, must I already be running the 
vmlinux kernel made for it? It seems to always copy to 
/lib/modules/2.4.23-pre5-ben0
I was using Set version information on all module symbols in Loadable 
module support. Could this have somehow set a kernel version file (if 
such exists) somewhere?
Should I just erase all of my source trees and start over from scratch? 
  Do I need to be running a built kernel to run make_install to update 
/lib/modules for the kernel I've just built?
I am using Yellowdog linux (ppc) 3.01
I do not subscribe to this forum due to heavy traffic but will watch it 
from the website versions.
Thank you!
Ima
