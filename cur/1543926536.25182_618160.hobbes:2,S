Linux subscribes to the host based addressing model rather
than an interface based addressing model.  Both approaches
are valid by RFCs.
Because of this, in cases where a choice can be made Linux will
advertise what is most likely to result in successful communication.
This is likely why we are changing that target address to the one of
the interface actually sending back the reply rather than the zero
value you used.
In fact I think this information can be useful to the sender of
the DAD request.
