I'm sorry, but I don't understand your reference to MPI here. MPI is a
high-level API; MPI can run on top of whatever communication features
exists: TCP/IP, shared memory, VI, etc.
MPI (as well as other "standards" for parallel programming - PVM, OpenMP)
came from the need to have a common interface, not to have all parallel
programs include specific code to deal with TCP/IP, shared memory, VI,
etc. whenever they were available. Instead, MPI serves as a middle-man
between them and the parallel programs. So, MPI cannot be faster than the
underlying communication features.
