Seconded, please.  It's obviously an important patch but it's
rather large and opaque.  A description of what it is doing and
in particularly *why* it is doing it would really help.
A nice way of providing such a description is inside
/*
 * these thingies
 */
so the information is not lost.
I particular:
- Does the file_operations-based file-backed IO work with all
  crypto setups?
- What are those preallocated pages doing?  Are they really needed
  with the 2.5 VM?  What problem are they solving?
Thanks.
(BTW: check out the ARRAY_SIZE macro ;))
