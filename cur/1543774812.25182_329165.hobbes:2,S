What's reasonable about a system without serial connectivity? Damn hard 
to debug with a serial console without one. Yes you can get around it, 
but it's one more issue to address. PS/2? I have enough KVM hardware in 
place to make that non-sales point, and I bet that there are lots of 
people with some fancy mouse, or keyboard, or game thingie, that it's 
cheaper to keep the features than drop them. I don't know if the ATX 
standard requires them, but low cost features are hard to drop.
