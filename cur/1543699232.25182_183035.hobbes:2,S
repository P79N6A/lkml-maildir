Agreed. Early 2.6test kernels had serious keyboard issues on my laptop,
and the effort of switching backwards and forwards between LVM1 and 2
has put me off trying again on that box. If I could run 2.4 with LVM2
easily without having to worry about yet another manual kernel patch I'd
be a lot more inclined to do testing.
