Hi...
Back from holydays and trying to get up-to-date with new kernel releases.
With 2.6.13-mm1, I get this:
werewolf:/usr/src/linux# make
  CHK     include/linux/version.h
make[1]: `arch/i386/kernel/asm-offsets.s' is up to date.
  CHK     include/linux/compile.h
  CHK     usr/initramfs_list
  LD      drivers/scsi/aic7xxx/built-in.o
drivers/scsi/aic7xxx/aic79xx.o: In function `aic_parse_brace_option':
: multiple definition of `aic_parse_brace_option'
drivers/scsi/aic7xxx/aic7xxx.o:: first defined here
make[3]: *** [drivers/scsi/aic7xxx/built-in.o] Error 1
make[2]: *** [drivers/scsi/aic7xxx] Error 2
make[1]: *** [drivers/scsi] Error 2
make: *** [drivers] Error 2
I have both aic7xxx and aic79xx built-in in my config. The problem is
including aiclib.c from both source files...
Fast and dirty workaround is plaguing it with 'static inline's, but it has
to be a better way...
