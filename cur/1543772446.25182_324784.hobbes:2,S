I think that is a really bad idea then. It only helps on irq-latency. The
rest of the system will see lower performance. It should certainly not be
on as a default thing with PREEMPT_RT. Such low latencies are rarely
needed.
I think extremely low irq-latencies can better obtained with other 
solutions closer to the sub-kernel approach, i.e. taking it completely 
away from the scheduler such that the whole kernel - including the
scheduler, raw_spinlock etc. - runs with irqs enabled.
Actually, I think there should be 3 "levels" of irq-macroes:
 local_irq_disable()      should not compile under PREEMPT_RT (!!)
 raw_local_irq_disable()  should be used within the core kernel code.
 hard_local_irq_disable() for the very low latency interrupt systems.
Under normal circumstances raw_local and hard_local should refer to the
hardware but raw_local can be made into a soft-interrupt state close to
the sub-kernel approach such that one or two very special interupts can
come through.
