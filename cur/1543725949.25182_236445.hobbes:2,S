Thanks for putting the fact that I was an idiot so kindly... :)

Looks good to me.

I'll put this together, though the implementation will probably change as we 
add PROM support in the SLIT and SRAT tables for our host to PCI bridges.
Platforms that support it should probably also use pcibus_to_node in their 
pci_alloc_consistent and dma_alloc_coherent APIs if possible.
Thanks,
