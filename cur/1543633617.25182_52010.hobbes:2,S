No, I do understand your point. And this does not bring "knowledge of
cachelines and whatnot" into the driver; those "macros" could similarly
be calls to arch-specific code that acts based on a pdev. I was simply
trying to think of a compromise between that and massively changing the
interface by which a driver obtains buffers. And I assume alloc_skb()
and others would need to change otherwise. How would you specify if your
skb data needs to be PCI DMA-able? What about net drivers not using DMA
at all?
Thanks,
Will
