I tried it a few time, system freezes but the fault handler
has not been called. First time the system rebooted completly,
second time I got no output at all.
I added the proposed line into the pre-handler. Here is the
output:
	kprobe registered address c0107bd0
	pre_handler:p->addr=0xc0107bd0, eflags=0x282
	root@esz-mobil:/tmp/kprobes# double fault, gdt
	at c049bd00 ...
The first line is the output of "init_module". The second
line is the output of the pre_handler. As you can see,
before the "double fault" message I get one prompt. Could
there be a problem with the timer interrupt?
