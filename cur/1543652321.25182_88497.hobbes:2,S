Don't know.

Normally it doesn't work because USB devices are detectly
asynchronously (from a kernel thread). At the time a USB device is
discovered, the root mounting code has already given up.
I have a patch to fix this at
http://www.lammerts.org/software/kernelpatches/usb-storage-root.patch
It's tested only with USB harddisks, but will probably also work with
DVD drives.
