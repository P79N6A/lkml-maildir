By itself I don't think we are going to observe any real problems
with this patch.
However if we are going to be serious about this we need to do a
few more things.
- kill iopaic_renumber_irq.
- Increase NR_IRQS.
We will still be limited to about 208 interrupts in use at one
time, but we can allow more irq sources to be described.
This reminds me.  I really need to dig up my patch that doesn't
allocate a vector for an irq until request irq time.
