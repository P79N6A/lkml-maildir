There's an atomic op there (and another on the way out).  Probably on a 
busy cacheline.  Still it's probably lost in the noise.
Regardless of that, I think that specifying the fd per submission is 
wrong.  It feels like a setup thing that needs to be done once.  We 
shouldn't skimp on syscalls, especially on something as important as 
unifying the async event model.

I don't see how.  It's still per submission.  You could do it on the 
first iocb, but that's just adding warts to the API.
You could add an IO_CMD_BIND_EVENTFD, but that feels wrong too, as it 
isn't really an I/O command.
