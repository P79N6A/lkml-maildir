Hi All,
    Here we are in need of a design decision . The problem is as follows:
We are writing device driver for network adapter, as part of this we need to
exchange some information between user and kernel(driver) and vice versa. As
i know this can be implemented using IOCTLs. Please suggest an alternative
approach for this.
Please keep a copy for me, because i am not subscriber to this list.
Thanks
Gangadhar
