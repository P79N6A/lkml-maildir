Oh, I missed that point.  It should work for m41t00 indeed.

Yes, some more works would be needed on m41t00 to support multiple
(different) M41Txx chips at same time.

Now I'm thinking this way.  Still thinking...

OK, I see.  I think LCD approach is worth indeed.

My real target is M41T80, which seems a subset of M41T81.
(Sorry for not writing this before.)
I agree m41t00 can be supported by rtc-ds1307 driver already.
So the next theme would be how we support M41T8x chips.  I think
Alexander's rtc-m41txx is good candidate for them.
Then M41T00 users can choose rtc-ds1307 or rtc-m41t00.  Not so bad, I
think.
