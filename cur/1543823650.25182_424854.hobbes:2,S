Hmm, I'm using Gmail with Elinks which is a text based browser and it works
(OK, ugly and sometimes buggy). So the problem is not the content itself in
general but the browser (sure, I can't browse flash or AJAX powered site
with Elinks very well though :). I may try to use Gmail on a real Commodore
64 with Contiki it would be a very interesting experiment :)
