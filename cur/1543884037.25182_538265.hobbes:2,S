Argh. My mistake, that's what I get for looking at old code and new code at
the same time. Since this is a dprintk, I agree that we should probably
just toss this patch. If you're debugging, then there's good reason to want to
see this.
As for moving the dprintk, I'm not so sure that's a great idea either.
nfs4_map_error is called from a couple of different places and I'd think
leaving the dprintk the a more "general" location would be good.
