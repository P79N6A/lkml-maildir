Hi Vegard.
Digging through my mailbox I found this patch of yours.
I tried to apply it and saw following output:
In file included from linux/mmzone.h,
                from linux/topology.h
                from linux/mmzone.h
                from linux/gfp.h
                from linux/slub_def.h
                from linux/slab.h
                from linux/percpu.h
                from asm-generic/irq_regs.h
include/asm-xtensa/irq_regs.h: warning: recursive header inclusion
But looking at the file (include/asm-xtensa/irq_regs.h) did
not help me understand where to look to fix it.
Can you pinpoint the culprint better so this is becoming useful?
I would also like to see this integrated with checkincludes.pl
as both script do some simple static checks of the header files.
Additional bonus if we can reuse this to do better check of
our exported headers.
