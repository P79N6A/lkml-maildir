Yeah - that's why I said in the original message that it's not
especially lower in energy - the energy is used at a lower rate,
so is much cheaper to supply.

's datasheet says to program the 32Mbyte chip takes about 30mw*120s, or 
3.5J or so.
For a gigabyte, that's 100J - a fairly substantial amount of energy.
However - it's at a low rate, so it's not _too_ expensive to supply.
