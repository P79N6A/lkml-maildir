I knew it! I just the announce for 2.6.13-rc1 did not contain this fact and I
did not realize booting this new kernel will fail on my machine which is bad for
a stable serie.

If I already have every device in /dev, I do not need udev and yes it is fast
:-) This is exactly what I did to boot my system again. Just via devfs, I do
not need an initial filesystem nor need anything in user space to boot a full
system which I like.
