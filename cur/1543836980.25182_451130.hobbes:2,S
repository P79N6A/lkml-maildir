I believe Erics patch implements the following (correct me if I'm wrong):
vmlinux:
vmlinux is extended to contain relocation information. Absolute
symbols are used for non-relocatable symbols, and section-relative
symbols are used for relocatable symbols.
bzImage loader:
The bzImage loader code is no longer required to be loaded at a fixed
address. The bzImage file contains vmlinux relocation information and
the bzImage loader adjusts the relocations in vmlinux before executing
it.
So I would say that the runtime address of symbols in vmlinux are
changed by the bzImage loader. Or maybe I'm misunderstanding?
