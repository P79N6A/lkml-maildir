Seems way too complicated to me. You can do everything from kernel.
You probably shouldn't use file handles in kernel, but you can use
file structure. Just open via filp_open, ioctl via ->f_op->ioctl
and close via filp_close (it will fput the structure).
You have to be in process context, either your ioctl handler or kernel
thread would do.
