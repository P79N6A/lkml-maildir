Yes:
Linux version 2.4.5-xfs-1.0.1 (root@awacs.dhs.org) (gcc version egcs-2.91.66
19990314/Linux (egcs-1.1.2 release)) #10 SMP Fri Sep 21 18:34:40 CEST 2001
Linux version 2.4.14-xfs-1.0.2 (root@awacs.dhs.org) (gcc version 2.96
20000731 (Red Hat Linux 7.1 2.96-98)) #2 SMP Sun Nov 25 08:15:50 CET 2001

No, that is to say, I haven't tried. 
Somebody else has suggested FS corruption as the cause of these Oopses. That
might very well be the case. On multiple occassions (perhaps coinciding with
the Oopses, sorry I can't be more specific), my system has hung when trying
to write to a file, and I would be left with files looking somewhat like
this (from memory):
$ ls -lhsa spook.wav
0 -rw-r--r--    1 p        p            165k Nov 25 09:04 spook.wav
Up until now I just rm'd these files and continued, but I suppose I can try
an xfs_repair from the boot CD.
