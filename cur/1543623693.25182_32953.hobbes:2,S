Subject: atkbd works as module but not linked in, 2.5.5-dj3

	This is a strange problem. I have CONFIG_KEYBOARD_AT set, and my System.map 
file has the correct entries to show that the atkbd.c file was linked into my 
kernel. Yet my AT keyboard is not detected. 'dmesg' shows:
 hdc: hdc1 hdc2 < hdc5 hdc6 hdc7 >
mice: PS/2 mouse device common for all mice
serio: i8042 KBD port at 0x60,0x64 irq 1
serio: i8042 AUX port at 0x60,0x64 irq 12
NET4: Linux TCP/IP 1.0 for NET4.0
	Now here's the strange part -- if I manually compile atkbd.c as a module and 
'insmod' it, this appears:
input: AT Set 2 keyboard on isa0060/serio0
	And then the keyboard works. Am I doing something wrong? Everything worked 
fine with 2.5.5-dj1, I have not tested 2.5.5-dj2 but would be glad to do so 
if anyone thought it might help.
	System is a dual p3-750, 440BX chipset. I'm going to keep looking into it, 
checking the code that should initialize the keyboard and also looking at the 
diffs closely.
