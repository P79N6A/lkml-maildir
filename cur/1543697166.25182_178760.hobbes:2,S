Because people *will* have build trees that are in the source directory.
You're effectively requiring everybody to rebuild their kernel using
some new syntax the first time they want to compile an external module.
External modules were compilable fine (if somewhat clumsily) in 2.4
without any special setup; it's a pity that 2.6 regresses in this given
how superior the build system is in every other way.

Would allowing non-O= builds to work again be 2.7 too ? It worked up
until very recently.
