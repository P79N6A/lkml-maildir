There's still stuff like kernel/module.c or the additional space each 
used EXPORT_SYMBOL takes that make CONFIG_MODULES=n kernels smaller.
But it depends on the use case:
If you are aiming for the smallest possible runtime memory usage 
CONFIG_MODULES=n is the best choice, while for some applications
where the bzimage (or similar) size is for some reason limited but
the size of the modules doesn't matter the approach you mention might 
be the best.
