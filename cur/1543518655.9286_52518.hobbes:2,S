The perpetrator of the pathetic mined website appears
to be the same author of the equally pathetic Hard
Disk Killer Pro batch file, which caused a lot of
trouble with some of my clients. 
The author has also posted the program to the
alt.med.fibromyaglia newsgroup under the name
sunshine.bat. 
He's located in South Melbourne, Australia, appears to
be about 19-20 years old, is taking acne medication
and has problems with the english language (of turkish
background?)
Having done some research at the request of clients
I've included it below. 
Something really does need to be done about this
seriously questionable  (see postings) individual.
