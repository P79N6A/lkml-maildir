Hi,
Is anybody working on an implementation of MPLS for Linux?
There's an implementation of MPLS for FreeBSD already; NIST Switch at
http://www.antd.nist.gov/itg/nistswitch
  . We're looking for people who
might be interested in implementing MPLS for Linux, or porting NIST Switch
to Linux.
Many thanks,
