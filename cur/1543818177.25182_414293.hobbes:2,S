Theres a lot of comments - check the archives of netdev on the thread
as well as a newer thread under "Broadcast ARP packets on link local
addresses (Version2)"

IMO not the way it is defined right now in that patch. 
As suggested in the thread, best way is for the kernel to check
if it is link local and do the advert in broadcast instead of unicast.

I think user space setting the attribute of the address to be link local
would be a sufficient hint to the kernel to broadcast the arps.
