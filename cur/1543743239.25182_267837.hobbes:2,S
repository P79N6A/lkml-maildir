sparc64 was one of the things that definitely depended on it. Also, early
init/main.c depended on the stack not getting clobbered by the initial
fork, but that thankfully was cleaned up with the kernel threads
interfaces.

Quite frankly, I'd prefer developers to do it by just editing the 
Makefile, or doing it entirely statically for some architecture. 
For something like FRV in its current stages it simply doesn't _matter_,
but in architectures that get actual real usage, I absolutely hate the
idea of having different optimization options and wildly different code.
It just results in bugs being harder to reproduce.
And for architectures that don't have enough users to matter, arguably you 
shouldn't then need to have a config option that is visible to the rest of 
the world.
