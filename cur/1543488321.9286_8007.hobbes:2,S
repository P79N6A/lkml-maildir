Since Creative seems to have run short of cash and had to economize on
product names, is there someone who can identify the actual CTnnnn (or
whatever) part number of the boards that are like this?  There have been a

Blaster 16, and now it appears they are pulling the same reprehensible
trick with the Vibras.
