Since a while include/linux/init.h contains the line
    * Also note, that this data cannot be "const".
Why is this? Because const data will be put in a different section?
However, quite some code defines const __init variables (see list below).
So what should be done now?
  1. Remove const from __initdata variables
  2. Make __inidata work with const variables
FWIW, many sources still use __init for data, while it should be __initdata.
