Hmmh, makes sense to me, but there will probably be people complaining 
"sound config has disappeared for me" ;)

Well, I think that's okay, but you should check back with _rmk_.
What I like about that patch is that it actually removes duplicated code. 
I think that's exactly where this effort should start. For example, the 
SCSI patch didn't do this, though AFAICS it would be nicely possible to 
unconditionally source drivers/scsi/Config.in and then have the if in 
there.
These are trivial changes, and they make it easier to see what's happening 
in the patches which actually change behavior. Taking that a step further, 
this should also be a nice opportunity to introduce drivers/Config.in and 
remove even more duplication from arch/$ARCH/config.in. It comes of the 
cost of testing for the architecture, since e.g. s390 does not want to 
include most of drivers/*, but that means we'd actually collect this 
knowledge at a centralized place.
Introducing drivers/Config.in could be done nicely piecemeal as well, 
without any change in behavior which is always good. It would also provide 
a possibility to not lose the ARM knowledge.
I think it's basically just a question of taste if you prefer to initial 
global subsystem question in drivers/Config.in or 
drivers/<subsys>/Config.in.
drivers/isdn/Config.in starts with
	mainmenu_option next_comment
	comment 'ISDN subsystem'
	if [ "$CONFIG_NET" != "n" ]; then
	   bool 'ISDN support' CONFIG_ISDN_BOOL
	   if [ "$CONFIG_ISDN_BOOL" = "y" ]; then
	      mainmenu_option next_comment
since I did not like having that duplicated in each arch/*/config.in. It
also makes sense in the "have as much information as possible about a
subsystem located in one place (drivers/<subsys>)". By the way, if you do
these kind of changes, also check Config.help, you may be able to remove
duplicated entries there as well ;)
The drawbacks of that solution as opposed to having the above in 
drivers/Config.in and ending with source "drivers/isdn/Config.in" are:
o We need to source all the Config.in files even when the subsys gets 
  disabled, since we cannot know that beforehand
o The trivial patches moving statements like the above into the 
  subsys/Config.in means that all of that file should be indented, which
  makes the patches look really large, even though they change very 
  little.
I have no strong opinion either way, but I'd certainly like 
a drivers/Config.in.
Oh, what I don't like about your patches: You don't include them inline, 
so I cannot easily (R)eply to them and have them quoted ;)
