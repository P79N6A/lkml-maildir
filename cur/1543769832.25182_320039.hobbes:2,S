This is not the case. Proof from ps -FT output:

This is a distribution-specific patch. glibc as shipped by the FSF simply
refuses to run programs that reference the errno symbol: errno is no
longer an exported symbol at all. (This is reasonable, as such programs
would fail to work on a multithreaded NPTL program in any case.)
The only valid way to gain access to the errno symbol is to
#include <errno.h>. This has been true for as long as glibc2 has existed.
