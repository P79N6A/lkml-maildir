No. When you block the kernel lock is dropped.

One day in the future the audio layer has to run without the kernel lock.
However by then its likely to be ALSA. Getting the SMP locking right will
be fun, I dont think its worth repeating the effort for dead code (ie OSS),
nor will it help you anyway as your lock understanding isnt quite right
