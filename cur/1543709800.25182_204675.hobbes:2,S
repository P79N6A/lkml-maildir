Yes. It has.
At this point of time no one knows precisely where all they differ and 
how/whether they could be merged.
The threads code in my version saves all registers during a context switch. 
This provides two benefits:
1. GDB doesn't lose track of registers when going up a stack trace starting 
with switch_to.
2. If a thread calls schedule, the thread backtrace starts from caller of 
schedule rather than schedule itself. So info threads command shows a more 
meaningful output.
