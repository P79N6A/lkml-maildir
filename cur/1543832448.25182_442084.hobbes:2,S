OK, so the period for this kind of solution(s) to completely go away is
even longer.
Which brings me to my point. Given that with my proposal you would have
zero involvement with Suspend2 code (i.e. you would not be obligated to
fix/touch/do anything in *any way*), why not give Nigel a go? The man is
obviously willing to do stuff on his own and it won't cost you anything.
And if it doesn't work out - well, though luck for Nigel.
So, how about it?
