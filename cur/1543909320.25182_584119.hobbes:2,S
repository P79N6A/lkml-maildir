Hi Linus:
Please pull from:
	git://lm-sensors.org/kernel/mhoffman/hwmon-2.6.git release
You'll get four bugfixes.  This takes care of all known hwmon regressions, and
hopefully it's the last you'll hear from me before v2.6.23 goes final.
This patch series was also posted to the lm-sensors list yesterday:
