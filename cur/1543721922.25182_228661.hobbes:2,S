When monitor goes into this mode? Immediately after kernel starts, or
after you start X? Picture you see happens with some (stupid) monitors
if there are missing sync pulses. Are you sure that you do not have any
fbset or stty commands in your startup scripts? What if you boot with init=/bin/bash?

It works for me, with CRT analog monitor... What if you boot with
video=matroxfb:outputs:010,1280x1024-16@60 (if you plugged your LCD to analog
output) or video=matroxfb:outputs:100,1280x1024-16@60 (if you plugged your LCD to
digital output with digital-analog connector convertor) ?
You can also try patching your kernel with 
http://platan.vc.cvut.cz/ftp/pub/linux/matrox-latest/matrox-2.6.7-rc2-c1818.gz.
 It
should help you if videomode is destroyed by your initscripts.
