Agree, and I'm afraid this is what keeps RT from standard Linux.

I don't fully agree here, though... If it's not really the only way, I
think the user should be relieved of tasks like figuring out why some
real time applications are having problems. To us it's just a matter of
finding out who's messing with our real time tasks and lower it's
priority, but for the non-guru end user, this must be dealt with
automatically by applications. But would an API that allows some
applications to mess with low level system settings be a very nice thing
to have around? Perhaps it would, but the idea makes me a bit nervous...

Well, if there is a truly guaranteed maximum scheduling latency, I guess
it could be called hard real time... But I wouldn't call it reliable if
you can't disable any subsystem that *could* cause a missed deadline.
Accepted reasons for missed deadlines are system shutdown, hardware
failure and that kind of things; not anything that could possibly happen
on a working system.
