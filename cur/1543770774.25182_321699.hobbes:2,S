Huh? I fail to see how that one is exploitable, given that no in-tree callers 
should pass "tty" as NULL to any of the affected functions (that is impossible, 
AFAICS).
No? Julien?

You refer to copy_from_user() right?  I suppose so, because there's no mtrr 
outside i386.

Well, it requires root priveledges:
+    if (!len) return -EINVAL;
     if ( !suser () ) return -EPERM;   <---------------
So, its "safe".

Ok. Great Willy!
