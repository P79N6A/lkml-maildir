OK, I'll look with the assumtion that nothing should have changed in mind.
As for SG problems, I can fill several pages with them, but that's a
different (well known) subject.

I have the whole email exchange archived if necessary (you commented
on it at the time).  It's water under the bridge now.
The worry is that kernel developers are not paying much attention to
these sorts of 'bugs'; they don't consider these changes to be a
problem.  I'm glad that my main immediate concern was possibly
unfounded, but the content of the flame still stands.

5.3 was riddled with bounds bugs that didn't get fixed until 5.4.
You'd segfault all the time sticking with 5.3... but you'd have to
rebuild everything to use 5.4. Upgrading mindlessly (it was, after all
a subminor release change that introduced the incompatability) would
make matters even worse.  There was no reason to make those changes to
a minor release of libc.  Again, the ideas behind the flame stand.

This change would cause heisenbugs, not certain failure.  The
2.0.34->2.0.35 ioctl struct size change I mention above only ever
produced segfaults for two of my users.  Everyone else managed to keep
running, just happening not to page fault in the wrong place.  It was
still a bug.
I'll report on the results of my hunting.
