OK, fair enough.  But that's a quirk of the x86 architecture that
you're pretty tied to -- you don't actually need MSI, you just need
the interrupt numbering that is enabled on x86 with that config option.
Since Niagara boxes don't have HT anyway it's kind of a moot point.
Although I wonder what you would have to do to make your device work
with something like the MIPS SoCs that have HT...
