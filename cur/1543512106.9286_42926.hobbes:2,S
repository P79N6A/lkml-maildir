You did read his arguments about persistance, right? Or are you ignoring
them for some particular reason? devfsd handles device ownership and
permission persistance.
Don't like the default? Change it. It'll persist. No recompile or reboot
involved.
Don't like devfsd? Add "chown blah:blah /dev/foo;chmod 600 /dev/foo" to an
init script. Since you keep arguing that changing device ownership and
permissions is something you do extremely little, this shouldn't be much
of a burden.
Don't like that approach? Then don't use devfs; compile it out, and be
happy with your traditional behavior.
