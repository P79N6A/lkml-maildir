OK.

So the BIO client would need to keep some state somewhere about "this is
the next page to unlock".  That would best be in the BIO somewhere.
(I assume the block layer handles the case where the hardware signals
completion in non-sector-ascending-order?  That must have been fun to
code and test).

Well we still will have the problem where reading 512 bytes from /dev/fd0
does 64k of IO.  That is most sweet for reading a bunch of 32k ext2 files
from a hard drive, not so nice for reading fd0's partition table.
We can do all sorts of things by dropping parameters, hints and tunables
into q->backing_dev_info.  We just need to work out what is sensible for
this.  ummm.  I guess backing_dev_info.read_k_per_sec would suffice.
Or .i_am_a_floppy ;)
