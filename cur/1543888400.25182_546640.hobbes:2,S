Note that this data structure only needs conversion on x86_64 and ia64, but
not on powerpc and other 64 bit architectures that align __u64 also in
32 bit mode.
I would suggest you introduce a new __compat_u64 type as
typedef __u64 __compat_u64 __attribute__((aligned(4)));
in include/asm-{x86_64,ia64}/compat.h and as
typdef __u64 __compat_u64;
in the other architectures. Other people have hit the same problem
before and found varying workarounds, but I think we should just
do it correctly now.
