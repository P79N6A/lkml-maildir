I'm sorry if you miss understood.  That oops that I was repling to wasn't
mine.  I was just saying I saw one very similar, but I didn't bother to
decode it cause it didn't make it to disk and it was very long to be
decoding by hand.  The similarity I saw between this one and mine was both
the length, and the values in the call trace were rather close together,
so it looked like it was looping in a small bit of code.
Another thing I remembered from mine was the "Scheduling in interrupt" BUG
on line 684 of sched.c.
I'm home from work for the weekend.  I was planning on clearing my head,
and trying to come up with a good plan of attack for Monday.  One thing
I'm going to do for sure is get a console on the serial port working.  So
I can capture and decode these oopses I'm getting.

Oh, one more thing that might be important for my case.  As I've said a
couple of times, I'm running a SYM53C896 SCSI controller on my motherboard
into an externel RAID module.  I was getting oopses left and right
everytime I pushed the disk hard (compiling the kernel was okay, but
glibc was too much, one bonnie++ was okay, but 4 was too much).  When I
got the RAID controller I just found 32 MB to put on it, but I was
planning on upgrading it to 128 as soon as I could.  I got the 128 today,
and put it in.  I started pushing the disks hard again and for a little
bit I thought the problem was fixed.  But then I pushed even harder and
bam, I got that oops I was talking about above.  (When I say even harder,
this time it survived a glibc build (yay), but 4 bonnie++s still killed
it, but they did get farther.  Before the intelligent write would oops,
but now I get to almost the end of the sequential creation of files).
