You must do the ktimer_init first!
So the order must be:
   ktimer_init(&mytimer);
   mytimer.function = myfunction;
   mytimer.data = NULL;
   //...
Think of ktimer_init like memset(...) (since it actually does a memset)
You wouldn't do;
struct myvar;
myvar.my_field = 1;
memset(&myvar, 0, sizeof(myvar));
Right ;-)
