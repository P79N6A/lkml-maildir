I think we should do it right the first time (i.e., now :-)

Why not make it something more dynamic, such as a mount-time option per sb?
Even at 8, you waste most of that space for non-fan-out stackable file
systems such as ecryptfs; and those unionfs users who want more, will have
to _recompile_ the code.
And given that this code is shared, if just one f/s needs 100 branches, why
should ecryptfs waste 99*sizeof(pointer) bytes for every *_info structure?

Also, the functions don't check array bounds.  Where, if at all, this gets
checked against the STACKFS_MAX_BRANCHES value?  Shouldn't we at least put
some ASSERT's in there to catch bugs?
Of course, I realize that the above code is rather simple now and changing
it as I propose will require kmalloc/kfree (or containers) carefully used
throughout.
Thanks,
Erez.
