Yes, this was just a debug patch.
We broke quite a few systems by placing platform_finish() before
device_resume() and I suspected your system could be one of them.
Apparently, that's not the case.
In 2.6.22-rc2 we also moved platform_prepare() to after device_suspend()
and that's why I asked you to test this kernel.
