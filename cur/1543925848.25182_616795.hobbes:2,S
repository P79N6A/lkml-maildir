This is a technical issue with vger.kernel.org mailing lists that I've tried
addressing before - maybe davem can help fix it?
What I've tried doing is bouncing relevant postings from my procmail
filters to the list, but it seems to drop bounces (probably as spam).
Is there any way around this? (like can I get an exception to be allowed
to bounce stuff or mark it with some magic X-secret-knock: header?)
