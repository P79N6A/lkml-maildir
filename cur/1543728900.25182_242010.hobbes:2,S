The ext3 (and ext2) kernel code already does consistency checking of a
lot of data structures in the kernel, and if any errors are found the
superblock is marked with an "error" flag and the next time the system
is booted a full fsck is done.  The administrator has the option (via
the "errors=" mount option) to either panic the kernel, remount read-only,
or continue using the filesystem if an error is found.
The problem with re-reading blocks and checking for validity after a write
is that there is a good chance the block is still in cache (either kernel
buffer/page cache or disk cache) so this doesn't really add much robustness.
The other problem with this is that checking individual block validity
doesn't take the "big picture" into account since if we just wrote a block
to disk we assume that what we wrote is the correct thing so re-checking
this same data doesn't help much.
The periodic fsck of a filesystem snapshot, on the other hand, is as good 
as you can get for validity checking.  The only additional feature needed
is online repair, but that is a .00001% requirement vs. actually detecting
the error in the first place.
Cheers, Andreas
