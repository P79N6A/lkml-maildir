We're seeing some pretty good numbers (well above 5 Gb/sec, basically
PCI-X 64bit/133MHz limited) with sockets direct (SDP) on top of
InfiniBand.  This is running standard sockets applications, just using
the AIO patches for kernel 2.4.  Latency is also much better than TCP
on top of ethernet, although this is mostly just due to the
underlying transport.
