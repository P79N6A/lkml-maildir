It's not portable, and there's no reason to keep recalculating the value
on those platforms where it does work.  You need to store the mapping
value for later use.
Read the section "Optimizing Unmap State Space Consumption" in
Documentation/DMA-mapping.txt for some examples and information WRT
pci_map_xxx/pci_unmap_xxx too.
