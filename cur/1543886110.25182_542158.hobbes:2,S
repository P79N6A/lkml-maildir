Mmm... sounds more like a GNOME bug/crash than an X crash.
I've had this situation several times in the past with GNOME,
and each time it turned out to be some missing config file
or subdir that got wiped in a system update or reconfig.
Generally I only boot into GNOME when absolutely necessary
to test something under that environment, so I'm no expert.
KDE for me.
Cheers
