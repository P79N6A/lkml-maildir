Why does it exist twice? Once uninitalized, once intialized? Appearently
I miss the point.  I also dont find the place where ->command is called. 
There are other problems with this driver. If VIDIOC_S_STD gets passed
to cx25840_command, set_v4lstd will get a 64bit value as second arg. gcc
for ppc generates calls to __ucmpdi2, from libgcc.
Only a few archs implement this function inside the kernel. Maybe this
driver should become arm/fvr/h8300 only in 2.6.15?
