In that, case the following (puesdo-code) would need to be added to
ethtool.
(before reading link status)
1. $oldstate = GET(current software state of UP/DOWN from ifconfig)
2. if($oldstate != UP) then SET(software state to UP)
3. if($oldstate != UP) then (some delay might be needed)
4. read PHY status
5. if($oldstate != UP) then SET(software state to $oldstate)
Thus ethtool should always report the correct PHY state.
