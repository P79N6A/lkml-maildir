Hello,
I have the following proble. After I have upgraded the 
kernel from from 2.4.7 to 2.4.9 I have found that the new
kernel can not scan the partition table of the disk - it
freezes for a moment and than i continue but it can not
find the root device after that.
The situation with 2.4.10-pre14 and 2.4.9-ac14 is the same.
I haven't tried kernel 2.4.8 but with 2.4.7 and previous 
kernels it works fine.
The partition table of the disk is:
Disk /dev/hda: 64 heads, 63 sectors, 621 cylinders
Units = cylinders of 4032 * 512 bytes
   Device Boot    Start       End    Blocks   Id  System
   /dev/hda1   *         1        39     78592+  83  Linux
   /dev/hda2            40       562   1054368    5  Extended
   /dev/hda3           563       621    118944   82  Linux swap
   /dev/hda5            40       354    635008+  83  Linux
   /dev/hda6           355       451    195520+  83  Linux
   /dev/hda7           452       562    223744+  83  Linux
the chipset of the ide controller is VIA82C59x. The disk is quantum
fireball_tm1280a ata.
Any ideas? If the partition table of the disk is not correct, how to
fix it?
Luben
P.S. Please cc me, because I'm not in the list.
