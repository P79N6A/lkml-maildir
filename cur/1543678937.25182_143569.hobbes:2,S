Tony,
I have compared the working configuration file and original one, and do see some possible setting issues.  I am tied up by other stuff and don't have time to confirm it now.  The suspicious parts are:
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_INITRD
CONFIG_SERIAL_8250
CONFIG_VGA_CONSOLE
CONFIG_SERIAL_CORE
CONFIG_SERIAL_CORE_CONSOLE
All above are set to yes in working configuration file but no in original file.
Eddie
