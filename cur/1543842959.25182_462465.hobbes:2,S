I do not buy this argument because I do not believe you
can "audit" a driver at "first sight".  You'll have to
look at the mapping call anyway, something might be wrong
there (playing evil __ioremap() tricks, mapping the wrong
size, whatever).
I do see your point, I don't believe the ramifications are
as severe as you make them to be though, esp. when compared
to all the (readability, auditing!) problems that having
more different interfaces for basically the same thing will
bring us.
