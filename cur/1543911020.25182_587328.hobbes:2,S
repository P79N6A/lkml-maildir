Why is a performance critical path on a paravirt kernel even using I/O
instructions and not paravirtual device drivers ?
It clearly makes sense to virtualise I/O operations if you are doing that
(so you can do posting, triggers and predicted reply handling guest side
to keep the trap rate sane) but I don't see why this situation occurs in
the first place for paravirt.
