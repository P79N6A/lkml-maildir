I can suspend to disk my Mac mini, reboot into MacOS X, shutdown, and
then resume in Linux. I also did this with APM suspend to disk support
on my ThinkPad some years ago, using Linux and Windows.
So, dualboot and suspend support isn't mutual exclusive. This is only
the case if suspend is limited to suspend to RAM.
