Actually, get_user_pages() does that for you.  You have to make R/O any
writable pte where the guest doesn't set the dirty bit (so you can trap
it later) but last I put a printk in there, Linux doesn't do that.

Well first I was just going to see how well hooking into the shrinker
works.  That might be sufficient: just throw out shadow refs to pages
when there's pressure.
If not, it does get harder.  A callback in the mm struct to say "I want
to swap your page out" is required if we don't take a reference to the
page.  Dirty bit handling would be an interesting issue (maybe the
callback can say "No!" and dirty the page again?).
I fear mm code.

Yeah, but it's one thing stopping lguest from being non-root usable, so
I want it there, too.
Cheers,
Rusty.
