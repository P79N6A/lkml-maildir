If you want geographical type device specification hierarchies, to
sanely manage that kind of stuff, they belong via sysfs or something
userside like that.
Using a bunch of different majors does not help the situation you
speak of.
What if I have 1,000 cyclades cards in my system?  The cyclades
serial major number helps me diddly in that case.  What about
having 82 8250's?
