Maybe where you live, but in my world some things are most certainly 
impossible.  Getting a 1MHz CPU to run at 1THz is impossible.  Having the 
kernel automatically install the latest firmware for a buggy device, without 
actually having the new firmware file, is impossible.  Turning your 17" LCD 
monitor into a 50" HDTV is impossible.

Thanks for proving my point.  That's a perfect example of the difference 
between "hard" and "impossible."

Again, that was one of my earlier questions, since some people here were 
saying "impossible" while other were saying "really hard."
