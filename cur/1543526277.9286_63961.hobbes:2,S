When sshing to my mailserver in a console and loading up mutt, I see that
sometimes when there is a big screen update or when a lot of text is sent
at once, the console somehow gets stuck as if I pressed ^S or
scroll-lock, but the scroll-lock LED does not light.  If I press
scroll-lock twice, the session resumes.  Pressing it once makes the LED
come on, but nothing changes.
I just noticed this is easily reproducible by typing "ps aux" at the
shell.  I have to press scroll-lock twice, sometimes multiple times, to
get through the ps output.  ^S and ^Q do not appear to change anything. 
I can't reproduce it over my LAN with a "ps" listing, but "yes" seems to
show it quite easily.
"yes" locally in a console doesn't seem to do anything.  Ahh, it does
happen if I ssh to localhost, though (not using unix98 ptys).  devfs is
disabled.  Seems to work fine in terminals in X.
