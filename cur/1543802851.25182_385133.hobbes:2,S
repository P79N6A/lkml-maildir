Andreas,
	I've been looking into this problem a little bit more (did some digging to 
try and teach myself a little bit about the page flags). I noticed after 
posting that I had bad page states reported in dmesg for amarokapp (new ones) 
as well. 
	So I got a bit curious and looked to see what bits were stuck on... and I 
started to wonder if it could have something to do with ALSA. (Unfortunately 
I'm quickly reaching the limit of my current understanding of the kernel's 
innards)
	Anyway, I tried a test - made sure both amarokapp and artsd were dead, then 
used rmmod to pluck out every last "snd" module. I put them back in, fired up 
amarok, and went to play a song. It played fine with no noticeable latency, 
so I tried switching to another track. Doing so caused the system to freeze 
for a few seconds and another set of bad page states to go rushing through 
the log.
	I can accept bad memory (though I think it's unlikely on this system because 
I've tested that fairly recently) but the page states, while bad, are 
consistently (not randomly) so.
	I'd reboot right now and test it, but at the moment I'm capable of 
reproducing these page state errors 100% of the time, so if there are any 
sorts of things I can do to debug the thing while it's up I'd like to move 
forward with that before I reboot and lose whatever 'ideal state' got me here 
in the first place.
Thanks,
Chase
