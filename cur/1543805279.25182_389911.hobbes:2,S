The block layer SG_IO is just that, it's completely transport agnostic.
There's not a lot of duplicated code. In the future, perhaps sg will
disappear and be replaced by bsg which is just the full block layer
implementation of that (SG_IO can currently be considered a subset of
that support).

Please point me at that huge amount of code. Hint: there is none.
Deja vu, anyone?
