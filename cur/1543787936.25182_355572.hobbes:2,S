Nothing much, simply that as far as I know, the common coding style is
that function declarations/definitions should be on one line and if
that line can't fit in 80 chars then arguments are moved to the next
line and indented by two tabs. That's the style I believe is the most
official one (if such a thing exists), so that's the style I changed
everything throughout the file to obey.
