Hello!
Just or those beeing lazy like me, there's a small script, which
retrieves the latest kernel via http using wget [0].
You can use it after you read about the latest kernel [1].
In theory one could also use wget -c to and then put the script under
control of cron, but wget has no
'--do-not-say-something-if-file-is-already-there-and-complete' switch,
so it will always tell you that the file is already there.
Nico
