Subject: 16TB filesystems on 2.6 via NFSD?

I am looking at moving beyond 1.5-2TB limitations in 2.4 and RHEL3 by 
using a 2.6 kernel. I have read that the filesystems scale to 16TB in 2.6, 
I just want to verify that nfsd will scale along with the filesystem to 16TB
as well.
Also, I would love to hear any opinions around performance/stability 
of going beyond 2TB filesystems on the 2.6 kernel.
Thanks in advance,
