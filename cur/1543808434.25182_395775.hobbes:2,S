1)  File != device.
2)  st_dev != st_rdev
3) The reference you specified says nothing about st_dev (or st_rdev)
being invariant while the system is runnning.  Line number, please?
4) POSIX/SUS is very careful not to define what dev_t.  Use of mknod to
create block/chracter devices, and depending on any properties of
dev_t is likely to get you into trouble.
5) The st_rdev of a particular file, like /dev/hda *does* remain
invariant.  The device which it points to may change, but that's a
different matter --- and POSIX/SUS is very deliberately silent on your
subject.
THEREFORE, your claim that Linux's behaviour violates POSIX/SUS is
demonstrably false.  Quod erat demonstratum.
