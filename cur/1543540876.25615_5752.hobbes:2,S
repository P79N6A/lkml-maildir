Yes. The correct fix should be to add a
	atomic_inc(&current->user->processes);
to just before the atomic_dec(&user->processes). Because we also need to
increment the root process count and not just decrement the process count
of whoever happened to do the kmod()..
And no, it's not tested, I'd love to hear whether it fixes the problem
people have.. (I have that atomic_inc in my kernel already, but it would
be good to have it verified from somebody who actually _uses_ kmod ;)
