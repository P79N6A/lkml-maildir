OK, sure, but if we really care about this saving, then unconditionally
casting to u64 is therefore wrong as well ... this is starting to open
quite a large can of worms ...
For the record, if we have to do this, I fancy sector_upper_32() ... we
should already have some similar accessor for dma_addr_t as well.
