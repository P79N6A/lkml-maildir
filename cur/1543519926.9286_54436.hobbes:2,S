Hi,
I previously reported this bug with the ATAPI cdrom driver in Linux
2.2.13. Well, I haven't found the problem yet but I can say that it
does happen with CD-ROMs that only have audio tracks, just not as
often as with my combined audio / (data, video) discs. For instance, I
have just done
# hdparm -c 1 /dev/cdrom
with a purely audio CD in the drive, and been rewarded with:
Dec 20 01:17:48 WellHouse kernel: hdc: packet command error: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComple
Dec 20 01:17:48 WellHouse kernel: hdc: packet command error: error=0x30 
Dec 20 01:17:48 WellHouse kernel: ATAPI device hdc: 
Dec 20 01:17:48 WellHouse kernel:   Error: Medium error -- (Sense key=0x03) 
Dec 20 01:17:48 WellHouse kernel:   Unable to recover table of contents -- (asc=0x57, ascq=0x00)
Dec 20 01:17:48 WellHouse kernel:   The failed "Test Unit Ready" packet command was:

Dec 20 01:17:48 WellHouse kernel: hdc: packet command error: error=0x30 
Dec 20 01:17:48 WellHouse kernel: ATAPI device hdc:

Dec 20 01:17:48 WellHouse kernel:   Unable to recover table of contents -- (asc=0x57, ascq=0x00)

Even more rarely, I can sometimes load the audio CD into the drive and
the DRIVE_STATUS ioctl will do nothing - no errors are reported but
the CD isn't identified either.
I can't claim to understand what's happening; I just load and unload
CDs and sometimes the DRIVE_STATUS ioctl explodes (although more often
with some CDs than others). 
I hope this means something to somebody,
Cheers,
Chris.
