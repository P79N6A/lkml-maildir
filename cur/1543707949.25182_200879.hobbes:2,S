sh64 doesn't exist in 2.6 yet, attempting to build a kernel for it is futile.

sh and sh64 require completely different toolchains. They're very different
platforms, and have very little in common.

These are due to erroring on .rept usage for filling in the sys_call_table in
arch/sh/kernel/entry.S, in 2.6 we've already cleaned this up in the LinuxSH
tree by just dropping it and padding out for NR_syscalls, I suppose something
similar will have to be done in the 2.4 case..

The sh64 build errors according to logs[7] are issues with your toolchain,
binutils in particular.
