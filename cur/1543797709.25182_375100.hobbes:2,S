Cool. That is a patch that should go on top of mine, because most of
my patch is aimed at moving modifications under interrupts-off sections,
so you would then be able to use __local_xxx operations very easily for
most of the counters here.
However I'm still worried about the use of locals tripling the cacheline
size of a hot-path structure on some 64-bit architectures. Probably we
should get them to try to move to the atomic64 scheme before using
local_t here.
