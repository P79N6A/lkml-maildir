Very sad. This will make a lot of people unhappy, even to the point
where they might prefer disabling noidlehz over super slow gettimeofday. 
I assume you at least have a suitable command line option for that, right?
Can we get a summary on which systems the TSC is considered unstable?
Normally we assume if it's stable enough for gettimeofday it should
be stable enough for longer delays too.
