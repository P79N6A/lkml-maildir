....and provided the groups of processes that are sought to be 
regulated as a unit are relatively static.

In overhead, I presume you're including the overhead of running as 
many uml instances as expected number of classes. Not just the 
slowdown of applications because they're running under a uml instance 
(instead of running native) ?
I think UML is justified more from a fault-containment point of view 
(where overheads are a lower priority) than from a performance 
isolation viewpoint.
In any case, a 30% overhead would send a large batch of higher-end 
server admins running to get a stick to beat you with :-)
