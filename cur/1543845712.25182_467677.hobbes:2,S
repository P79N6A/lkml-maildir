Exactly why I mentioned the issue.  I trust Alan basically got the
ohci parts of that new root hub suspend code right, but I probably
have a lot more variety in OHCI silicon here ... but virtually no
time to assemble the relevant platform patches and test them with
new patches from MM/etc, given other ongoing work.
On the plus side, I think maybe OMAP1 devel boards are now mostly
buildable straight from kernel GIT (with i2c-omap merged), which is
a BIG improvement for at least one part of the testing equation.
