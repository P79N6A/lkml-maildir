+COMPILATION
+===========
+
+The filesystem should be enabled by turning on the kernel configuration
+options:
+
+	CONFIG_AF_RXRPC		- The RxRPC protocol transport
+	CONFIG_RXKAD		- The RxRPC Kerberos security handler
+	CONFIG_AFS		- The AFS filesystem
+
+Additionally, the following can be turned on to aid debugging:
+
+	CONFIG_AF_RXRPC_DEBUG	- Permit AF_RXRPC debugging to be enabled
+	CONFIG_AFS_DEBUG	- Permit AFS debugging to be enabled
+
+They permit the debugging messages to be turned on dynamically by manipulating
+the masks in the following files:
+
+	/sys/module/af_rxrpc/parameters/debug
+	/sys/module/afs/parameters/debug

+RxRPC remote operation protocol and may also be accessed from userspace.  See:

+AFS has a concept of mountpoints. In AFS terms, these are specially formatted
+symbolic links (of the same form as the "device name" passed to mount).  kAFS
+presents these to the user as directories that have a follow-link capability
+(ie: symbolic link semantics).  If anyone attempts to access them, they will
+automatically cause the target volume to be mounted (if possible) on that site.
 
-  (*) They cannot be listed. Running a program like "ls" on them will incur an
-      EREMOTE error (Object is remote).
+Automatically mounted filesystems will be automatically unmounted approximately
+twenty minutes after they were last used.  Alternatively they can be unmounted
+directly with the umount() system call.
 
-  (*) Other objects can't be looked up inside of them. This also incurs an
-      EREMOTE error.
+Manually unmounting an AFS volume will cause any idle submounts upon it to be
+culled first.  If all are culled, then the requested volume will also be
+unmounted, otherwise error EBUSY will be returned.
 
-  (*) They can be queried with the readlink() system call, which will return
-      the name of the mountpoint to which they point. The "readlink" program
-      will also work.
+This can be used by the administrator to attempt to unmount the whole AFS tree

 PROC FILESYSTEM
 ===============
 
-The rxrpc module creates a number of files in various places in the /proc
-filesystem:
-
-  (*) Firstly, some information files are made available in a directory called
-      "/proc/net/rxrpc/". These list the extant transport endpoint, peer,
-      connection and call records.
-
-  (*) Secondly, some control files are made available in a directory called
-      "/proc/sys/rxrpc/". Currently, all these files can be used for is to
-      turn on various levels of tracing.
-
 The AFS modules creates a "/proc/fs/afs/" directory and populates it:
 
-  (*) A "cells" file that lists cells currently known to the afs module.
+  (*) A "cells" file that lists cells currently known to the afs module and
+      their usage counts:
+
+	[root@andromeda ~]# cat /proc/fs/afs/cells
+	USE NAME
+	  3 cambridge.redhat.com
 
   (*) A directory per cell that contains files that list volume location
       servers, volumes, and active servers known within that cell.
 
+	[root@andromeda ~]# cat /proc/fs/afs/cambridge.redhat.com/servers
+	USE ADDR            STATE

 THE CELL DATABASE

-by the "rootcell=" argument.

+SECURITY
+========
+
+Secure operations are initiated by acquiring a key using the klog program.  A
+very primitive klog program is available at:
+
+	
http://people.redhat.com/~dhowells/rxrpc/klog.c
+
+This should be compiled by:
+
+	make klog LDLIBS="-lcrypto -lcrypt -lkrb4 -lkeyutils"
+
+And then run as:
+
+	./klog
+
+Assuming it's successful, this adds a key of type RxRPC, named for the service
+and cell, eg: "afs@<cellname>".  This can be viewed with the keyctl program or
+by cat'ing /proc/keys:
+
+	[root@andromeda ~]# keyctl show
+	Session Keyring
+	       -3 --alswrv      0     0  keyring: _ses.3268
+		2 --alswrv      0     0   \_ keyring: _uid.0
+	111416553 --als--v      0     0   \_ rxrpc: afs@CAMBRIDGE.REDHAT.COM
+
+Currently the username, realm, password and proposed ticket lifetime are
+compiled in to the program.
+
+It is not required to acquire a key before using AFS facilities, but if one is
+not acquired then all operations will be governed by the anonymous user parts
+of the ACLs.
+
+If a key is acquired, then all AFS operations, including mounts and automounts,
+made by a possessor of that key will be secured with that key.
+
+If a file is opened with a particular key and then the file descriptor is
+passed to a process that doesn't have that key (perhaps over an AF_UNIX
+socket), then the operations on the file will be made with key that was used to
+open the file.
