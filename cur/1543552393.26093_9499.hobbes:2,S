You can also pretty trivially keep track of an error term so that the
clock is right on average:
#define CLK_HZ 1193200 /* or whatever */
#define ET_PRECISION 1000
#define ET_TIMER_TICKS CLK_HZ*ET_PRECISION/HZ
#define ET_PCSP_TICKS 64*ET_PRECISION
...
static long et=0;
...
	et+=ET_PCSP_TICKS;
	if(et>ET_TIMER_TICKS) {
		et-=ET_TIMER_TICKS;
		simulate_timer_tick();
	}
This keeps track of the residual timing error to a few decimal places to
several decimal places and will get closer to HZ than even the current
code.
