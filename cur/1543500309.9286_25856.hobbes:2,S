In this case -- not. But when I see directory of size 115714 bytes (I had
directory of size > 1M with just few files once :-) in inn spool with just
few tens of files in it I know that it's time to recreate this directory.
BTW what's "actual size" ? If you'll create 10'000 files in directory and
then remove them directory will STILL hold 10'000 slots ! What's its size:
2 (for "." and "..") or 10'002 (for all slots on disk) ? And what about
HPFS and NTFS where andditional space is needed for b-trees and/or file
contents (yes, NTFS keep DATA of small files in directory blocks on disk) ?
Can you define what's "actual size" for all filesystems out there ?

Not at all (see above).

There are exists quite a few operations with file where "size" is sort of
boundary (seek, for example). But I'm not know disk operations where size
of directory (in any sense) is sort of boundary.

What for you'll use directory size (in your definition) ? And WHAT'S you
definition BTW ?
