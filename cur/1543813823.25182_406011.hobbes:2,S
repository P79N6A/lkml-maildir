Yes, but my confusion is about the following piece of code
<begin code>
       for ( ; height > 1; height--) {
               for (i = (index >> shift) & RADIX_TREE_MAP_MASK ;
                               i < RADIX_TREE_MAP_SIZE; i++) {
-                       if (slot->slots[i] != NULL)
+                       __s = rcu_dereference(slot->slots[i]);
+                       if (__s != NULL)
                               break;
                       index &= ~((1UL << shift) - 1);
                       index += 1UL << shift;

       }
       /* Bottom level: grab some items */
       for (i = index & RADIX_TREE_MAP_MASK; i < RADIX_TREE_MAP_SIZE; i++) {

<end code>
In the for loop, lets say __s is *not* NULL, we break from the loop.
In the loop below
slot->slots[i] is derefenced without rcu, __s is not used. Is that not
inconsistent?
