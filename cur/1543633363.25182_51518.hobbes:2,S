What?  __FUNCTION__ and __func__ can't be used interchangably.  But for
older compilers which lack __func__, you can do:
#define __func__ __FUNCTION__
And provided that __func__ is only used like this:
printk("Something bad happened in %s\n", __func__);
egcs-1.1.2 will be happy, gcc-2.95.x will be happy and gcc-3.x will be
happy and we won't be doing the now 'bad' thing of:
printk("Something bad happened in " __FUNCTION__ "\n");
(And if gcc-3.x ever drops __FUNCTION__, which I have nfc if they will,
we'll be ok still).
