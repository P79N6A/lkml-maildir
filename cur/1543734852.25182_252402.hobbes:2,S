the kernel sure can know about it, by passing a waitqueue into the
registration routine and calling wake_up once the discovery is over.

if the fsck can run from there ok, if for some reason it's not feasible
to run it from there (like if it would create a bus congestion by
running all the fsck in parallel if you attach multiple devices at the
same time), and/or you need some other seriaization, then probably
having a way to run things serially without a
spin-and-sleep-and-risk-to-hang could be needed. I guess in the worst
case one could serialize things by using file locking in /var/run
and by creating an API between the dev.d and the init.d scripts, is that
how the long term is supposed to work?
So it's more a question if the current interface is complete for all
usages, and if the fsck spin-and-sleep is just a temporary band-aid, or
if the spin-and-sleep is supposed to last longer than a few month
release cycle.
(and I'm not a udev guru, just in listen mode ;)
