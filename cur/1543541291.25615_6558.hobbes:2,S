   Yes, it is backwards. You wont find many IDE drives that support 512 byte
   sectors, and not even all SCSI drives do.
   The bugs is in the SCSI CD-ROM driver, it doesn't properly handle
   requests smaller than 2048 per block. So yes it is a known bug.
OK, can we get confirmation from folks that the problem with HFS
filesystems only occurs on with folks who are using SCSI CD-ROM's?
I just want to make sure this is properly noted on the 2.4 issues
page.....
