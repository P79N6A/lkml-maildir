Hi all!
Many times i saw and did things like "time make bzImage modules" or "times 
..." to know
how long kernel compile process takes, many users and admins use similar 
technique.
Is it possible to add this feature to genuine kernel?
Like adding (in the top Makefile, kbuild hackers please help)
START_TIME=`date +"%s"`
END_TIME=`date +"%s"`
_TIME=$(($END_TIME-$START_TIME))
or in another form with days(anyone use 2.6 on 486 ;) ?), hours, min,sec.
And another small bug - if your locale is not posix, f.e. for non-english 
languages
UTS_ strings in linux_banner will be corrupted. Maybe set posix locale in 
Makefile,
so unpractised users will not be confused?
