Now 1.1.4 is out, here is a summary of what are not there but
already merged to the "master" branch (i.e. 1.2.0 material).
Build and Environment issues:
      Makefile: add 'strip' target
      Fix the installation location.
      Allow building of RPM from interim snapshot.
      Exec git programs without using PATH (Michal Ostrowski).
      Disable USE_SYMLINK_HEAD by default (Pavel Roskin)
CVS:
      git-cvsimport: Add -A <author-conv-file> option (Andreas).
      cvsimport: ease migration from CVSROOT/users format
Pushes and Pulls:
      git-push: avoid falling back on pushing "matching" refs.
      git-push: fix --tags and document it.
      clone: --naked option.
      Add --keep option to keep downloaded packs to git-fetch (Tom Prince).
      Fix generation of "humanish" part of source repo (Uwe Zeisberger)
Usability Enhancements:
      git-describe: default to HEAD
      Documentation: show-branch.
      show-branch: make the current branch and merge commits stand out.
      show-branch: --current includes the current branch.
      show-branch: take default arguments from configuration file.
      octopus: allow criss-cross and clarify the message when it rejects
      octopus: allow manual resolve on the last round.
      checkout: automerge local changes while switching branches.
      checkout: merge local modifications while switching branches.
      checkout: show dirty state upon switching branches.
      format-patch: always --mbox and show sane Date:
----------------------------------------------------------------
These are still cooking in "pu" branch.
Build and Environment:
      Makefile: do not assume lack of IPV6 means no sockaddr_storage.
      fsck-objects: support platforms without d_ino in struct dirent.
      DT_UNKNOWN: do not fully trust existence of DT_UNKNOWN
      * These are for the latest Cygwin builds.
Documentation:
      New Tutorial (J. Bruce Fields)
      * Waiting for updates after the last round of comments.
Subproject:
      read-tree: --prefix=<path>/ option.
      write-tree: --prefix=<path>/ and --exclude=<prefix>/.
      commit-tree: --bind <sha1> <path>/ option.
      * Basic design has been outlined, and read-tree/write-tree
        are probably safe to push out, but commit objects that
        contain "bind" lines are unsafe until fsck-objects and
        rev-list are updated.
Annotate:
      rev-list: stop when the file disappears (Linus)
      * I've only taken a cursory look at this patch.
