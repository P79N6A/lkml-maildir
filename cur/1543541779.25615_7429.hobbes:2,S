HM better solution try something like this
DarkThree:~# tcsh 
# updatedb & ; cat /dev/random 
why tcsh because (same with sh)
DarkThree:~# updatedb & ; cat /dev/random
bash: syntax error near unexpected token `;'
DarkThree:~#  
a long time ago I was generating 16K long random key on server
it was proces lasting quite a few hours.
Later that day I did the same on house PC home it generetad
the same 16K 2-4 times longer ???
The same was if I generated key on server by night it was
Painfully SLOW :((
BUT it helped when I move mouse ???
updatedb also ?
so final solution was something about 
# updatedb --output=/dev/null & ; cat /dev/random
or
# updatedb --output=/dev/null & ;your program
maybe that will help you ?

Zoran
