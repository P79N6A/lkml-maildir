I think that is encouraging, for such a small setup. The make results
are particularly nice. The hangs are a bother, I have no good ideas on
why the occur. The fact that it happens on both archs indicates that
this is perhaps a generic problem, which is good. The code to support
this is relatively simple, so it should be possible to go over it with a
fine toothed comb and see if anything shows up.
You didn't get any watchdog triggers on the serial console, or anything
like that?

As to the hangs, yes it's definitely a step back. Cleanliness of code is
better though and it's something we can support, so I'm inclined to try
and make it work. The overhead of the cleaner approach should not be a
problem, it'll be a bit more costly than the ipi hack but not a lot.
Since the tuning and tweaks, we got rid of the allocations in the path,
so it should be about as fast as the original.
So once the base is stable, we can go and profile and squeeze some more
performance out of it :-)
