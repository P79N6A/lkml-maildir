this laptop has piix and i've never been able to use DMA on by default in
the kernel and when that is dropped, piix tuning is removed as an option.  i
can boot and operate w/out dma being on by default, turning it on w/ hdparm
doesn't seem to break anything.
i did notice yesterday when the battery died and i had to pull the power
cable for a split second, the laptop started a suspend sequence during the
startup e2fsck, i interruted it w/ a keypress but that wasn't sufficient.
a tap of the power switch and it resumed but hda (only harddrive) began
printing lost interrupts and keyboard response was lost.  a hard reset was
required. :(
