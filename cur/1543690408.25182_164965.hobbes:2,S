Tried it with 2.6.0-test5-mm1.
When i tried suspend to disk with my usb modem (Alcatel Speedtouch) 
attached, system generated oops, couldn't get a dump on disk, will send 
the handwritten oops later. When i tried from X suspend to disk was 
successful but resume failed and system rebooted itself, did not get a 
chance to figure out what went wrong.
