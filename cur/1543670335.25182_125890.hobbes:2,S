I beg to differ. There's a point where we've got to stop saying "oh,
this buffering mechanism is special and it requires its own code."
relayfs is there to provide a unified light-weight mechanism for
transfering large amounts of data from the kernel to user space.

Again, as I said earlier, relayfs doesn't care about filtering. That's
to the upper layers to take care of. It so happens that relayfs simplifies
filtering by allowing the upper layers to mux their data using separate
channels. In no way is anyone forced to do that, though. It's there if
you need it, and if you need to simply have a is_this_message_logged()
function, then so be it, but that's yours to implement.
As for buffer overflows and printk, automatically resizeable log buffers
using a water-mark scheme are on the relayfs to-do list.
