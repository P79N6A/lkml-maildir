Scalability is also solved by the signal-per-fd patch, as you know.
The main advantage of epoll is that it's lighter weight than rt-signals.
(IMHO signal-per-fd really ought to be included in 2.6 _anyway_, regardless
of any better mechanism for reading events.)

I agree that was the way to do it for 2.4 and earlier - you have to
work with a range of kernels, and minimum impact.
But now in 2.5 it's appropriate to implement whatever's _right_.
Time for me to take the big plunge and try a 2.5 kernel on my IDE
laptop, I guess :-)
