Roughly. The program I posted has some overflow errors (which you will
hit if testing expensive system calls that take >4000 cycles). They also
do an average, which is "mostly correct", but not stable if there is
some load in the machine. The right way to do timings like this is
probably to do minimums for individual calls, and then subtract out the
TSC reading overhead. See attached silly program.
>And why have int 80 also gotten faster?
Random luck. Sometimes you get cacheline alignment magic etc. Or just
because the timings aren't stable for other reasons (background
processes etc).
>Is this a valid testprogramm to find out how long a system call takes?
Not really. The results won't be stable, since you might have cache
misses, page faults, other processes, whatever.
So you'll get _somehat_ correct numbers, but they may be randomly off.
