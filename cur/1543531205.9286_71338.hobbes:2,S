I ran into trouble compiling ipc/shm.c, as THIS_MODULE was not
defined.  This was being used by:
static DECLARE_FSTYPE(shm_fs_type, "shm", shm_read_super, 0);
This macro, which uses THIS_MODULE, is defined in include/linux/fs.h,
but THIS_MODULE is in include/linux/module.h, which isn't included by
either fs.h or shm.c.
Adding #include <linux/module.h> to fs.h fixed the problem.
