Yes, this looks a lot more like what I had in mind. I'll read it through
once more, but this is basically how I envisioned it. The only thing that
looks suspect is that I don't think we should need the kernel lock even
around the merge_segments() call in do_brk():

because we're guaranteed to merge only a segment without any inode or
anything else, so there's no way we can do anything bad even conceptually:
the mm semaphore should protect us quite sufficiently.
Or is there something you noticed that I missed?
