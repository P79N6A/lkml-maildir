A question related to bigphysarea support in the native Linux
2.2.19 and 2.4.0 kernels.
I know there are patches for this support, but is it planned for 
rolling into the kernel by default to support Dolphin SCI and 
some of the NUMA Clustering adapters.  I see it there for some 
of the video adapters.
Is this planned for the kernel proper, or will it remain a patch?
At the rate the VM and mm subsystems tend to get updated, I am 
wondering if there's a current version out for this.
Jeff
