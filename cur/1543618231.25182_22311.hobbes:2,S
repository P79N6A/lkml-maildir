So can the interrupt handler code. The handler decides what to do,
depending on the status of the device. The higher level woken up task can
also do what it wants/ see fits in. The only difference is that higher level 
gets notified a bit earlier - nothing more.
Does the current preempt patch unconditionally mandates preemption to occur?
This would be indeed a design flaw. The handler has to make the decision -
he knows it best.

Ooh, that sounds different.
But where does a delayed wakeup makes sense in the _general_ case?
You wouldn't want slow interrupts. Kernel preemption allows you a quicker
notify of higher levels. It does not imply any policy on what to do 
with this event.
Of course it's still bad to flood the system with interrupts.
The interrupt handler has to decide if he has to wakeup a higher
level thread, immediatly, on the next schedule or not (if he can
handle it on its own).
