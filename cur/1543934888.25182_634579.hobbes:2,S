Input: usbtouchscreen - add support for GoTop tablet devices
Add support for GoTop Super_Q2/GogoPen/PenPower tablets to usbtouchscreen.
Protocol discovery was done by Yick Yan Lam.
==========
The tablets were added as touchscreen devices instead of tablets. The
tablets have some buttons while touch screen has no button. As a result,
the buttons on the tablets will not function when treated as
touchscreen.
Shouldn't the tablets be add to one of the device in the input/tablet/
directory, like wacom, instead of input/touchscreen?
