My goal is to eventually include the info tucked away on oops report lines
so that I can automatically dump bug reports with binary drivers, including
the growing number of people who lie about nvdriver and think that this will
get their bug cured.
insmod warnings is something I want to stay out of. I think thats up to
vendors and the like. I want to tell if people loaded crud I dont want
to tell them not to...
