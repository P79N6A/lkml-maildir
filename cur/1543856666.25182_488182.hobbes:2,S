Here good_sigevent() doesn't take care of SIGEV_THREAD. From this comment
from include/asm-generic/siginfo.h,
"It seems likely that SIGEV_THREAD will have to be handled from 
userspace, libpthread transmuting it to SIGEV_SIGNAL, which the
thread manager then catches and does the appropriate nonsense.
 However, everything is written out here so as to not get lost."
it looks like SIGEV_THREAD should never come into kernel. But atleast
libposix-aio does send SIGEV_THREAD all the way up to kernel.

Bharata.
