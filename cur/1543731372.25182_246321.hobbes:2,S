Forgive me if I'm talking bullshit, but wouldn't it be possible for you to
route the stream through a device with an entry in /dev/ which would be
opened by a userspace daemon which would take the stream from the in-kernel
pwc driver, apply all the codec magic to it, and then give it back to the
driver in the kernel so that the application that grabs the frames would get
the processed data? That way you would need only one userlevel daemon to
support the codecs and all the other apps would just read the data from the
framebuffer.
