Subject: [PATCH 03/22] record when sb_writer_count elevated for inode
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/2/9/348

There are a number of filesystems that do iput()s without first
having messed with i_nlink.  In order to keep from accidentally
decrementing the superblock writer count for these, we record
when the count is bumped up, so that we can properly balance
it.
I first tried to do this by assuming that, for each dec_nlink() to
zero, there was exactly one call to iput_final().  But, there are
a number of cases where this isn't true, especially in error handling
code.  Even if all of the filesystems were fixed up, it would be simple
to reintroduce new bugs imbalancing the mnt writer count.  This patch
trades that possibility for the chance that we will miss a i_nlink--,
and not bump the sb writer count.
I like the idea screwing up writing out a single inode better than
screwing up a global superblock count imbalance that will affect
all inodes on the superblock.
Also, since this is the first non-trivial use of the inc/drop_nlink()
functions, add some kernel docs for them.
