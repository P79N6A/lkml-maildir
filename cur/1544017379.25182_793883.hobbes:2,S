Jan 17 17:39:49 champagne kernel: [30342.273029] usb 4-3: reset high
speed USB device using ehci_hcd and address 4
I was using a usb pen that I disconnected just a second prior errors
appear, for some reason plugging out usb pen caused a reset on usb disk
(two port located on two side on my notebook, I didn't touch usb disk
while disconnecting usb pen)
