There are some flow control options in the kernel which should
help. From your description, it looks like they aren't enabled
by default ...
At the NordU/USENIX conference in Stockholm (this february) I
saw a nice presentation on the flow control code in the Linux
networking code and how it improved networking performance.
I'm pretty convinced that flow control _should_ be saving your
system in this case.
OTOH, if they _are_ enabled, the networking people seem to have
a new item for their TODO list. ;)

Rik
