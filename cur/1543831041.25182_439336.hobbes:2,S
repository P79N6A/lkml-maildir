Subject: [PATCH] EXT3: ext3 block bitmap leakage
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Andrew, Chris,
this bug is not relevant for 2.6.17 and later.
However, it is relevant for all 2.4.x and <2.6.17 kernels,
so I think this can be of interest to some people and worth commiting to 
2.6.16.x
This patch fixes ext3 block bitmap leakage,
which leads to the following fsck messages on
_healthy_ filesystem:
Block bitmap differences:  -64159 -73707
All kernels up to 2.6.17 have this bug.
