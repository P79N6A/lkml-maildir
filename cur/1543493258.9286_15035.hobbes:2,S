look at the documentation that comes with the linux kernel
(Documentation/mtrr I think), it tells you to echo a line to /proc/mtrr
basically you find the start of the linear framebuffer for your graphics
card (told to you when you run startx or xdm) and pass that information
along with the size of your graphics memory to /proc/mtrr and tell
/proc/mtrr that it's write combining (the reason for mtrr support,
mainly).
With an AMD you may still need Alan Cox's mtrr patch, or 2.2.6ac1 which
should include the mtrr support for AMD chips.  Cutting Edge says 2.2.6
has support for MTRR but that may be pentium only <shrug>.
For me, the command I run looks like this (millenium G200 SGRAM, 8megs):
echo "base=0xe8000000 size=0x800000 type=write-combining" > /proc/mtrr
and all is well :)
Good luck,
