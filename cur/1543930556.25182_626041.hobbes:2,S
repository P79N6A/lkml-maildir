Indeed, after looking over this horrid ASL stuff for ages I'm now starting
to believe that our IDE controller state is wrong,
since the Match()ing etc. in this particular _GTM implementation
is heavily dependant on actual PCI values
(it references some PCI_Config OperationRegion:s),
and some indexing seems to go wrong due to this.
IOW, it seems very likely that _GTM on these BIOSes (VIA chipsets) isn't
actually wrongly implemented but simply expects IDE controller values
to have been set up ""differently"".
Or... one could possibly even infer from this that - maybe -
the _GTM invocation spot is wrong, it should be done somewhere
different during bootup. Or whatever.
This seems to tell me again that we're often quick to blacklist
or whitelist things left and right when instead fundamental problems
are hidden somewhere.
Still investigating,
Andreas Mohr
