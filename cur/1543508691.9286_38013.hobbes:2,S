I just mailed druschel@cs.rice.edu to ask about extra information, work,
or references that he may have on the event queues paper that he was
a coauthor of.
Just saying this so other people dont just have about a dozen messages about
the same thing.
Please notice that this message is going to both freebsd-hackers and
linux-kernel, so if you reply, please remember to change the To line
appropriately.
