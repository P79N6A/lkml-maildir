i narrowed down some corruption i was having. it only happens on drives
attached to my qlogic isp card. 2.2 has no problem, and in 2.4.5-ac3 my
sym53c875 works fine. this machine is an alpha miata. it only happens when
writing out a lot to disk. eg, untarring a kernel tarball, restoring a
backup. anyone else see this?
