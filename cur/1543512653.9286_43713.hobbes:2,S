What does matter is that the drivers use the major number to
represent what they are, and the minor number as either a particular
instance of a device or a particular parameter, depending upon the
device. Look at /dev/fdxxxx (major/minor) as an example.
If these devices used strings, asside from having to all be rewritten,
you need a variable-length string-lookup every time they are accessed.
