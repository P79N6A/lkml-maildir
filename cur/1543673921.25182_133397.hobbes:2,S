           Summary: Between 2.5.68bk4 and bk5 usb stopped getting interrupt
                    with acpi
    Kernel Version: 2.5.68-bk5
            Status: NEW
          Severity: normal
             Owner: andrew.grover@intel.com
         Submitter: stian_web@jordet.nu
Distribution: Debian Sid
Hardware Environment: Asus CUV266-DLS Dual P3
Software Environment: 
Problem Description:
With 2.5.68bk5 usb don't get any interrupts anymore. This has been working
flawlessly untill bk5. When I diff dmesg from the two kernels, I get this:
+IOAPIC[0]: Set PCI routing entry (2-11 -> 0x81 -> IRQ 11)
+00:00:11[A] -> 2-11 -> IRQ 11
+IOAPIC[0]: Set PCI routing entry (2-10 -> 0x79 -> IRQ 10)
+00:00:11[B] -> 2-10 -> IRQ 10
+IOAPIC[0]: Set PCI routing entry (2-5 -> 0x51 -> IRQ 5)
+00:00:11[C] -> 2-5 -> IRQ 5
+IOAPIC[0]: Set PCI routing entry (2-9 -> 0x71 -> IRQ 9)
+00:00:11[D] -> 2-9 -> IRQ 9
This is there only with bk5, not bk4. Don't know if this as anything to do with it. 
Part of /proc/interrupts
With bk5 
  9:          0          0   IO-APIC-level  acpi, uhci-hcd, uhci-hcd, uhci-hcd
with bk4:
  9:        268          1   IO-APIC-level  acpi, uhci-hcd, uhci-hcd, uhci-hcd
Thanks you.
