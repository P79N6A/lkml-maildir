I can't see any design difference between your code and the original 2.3.x
code (you only cleaned up the code but most of such code is useless and
can be removed).
If you want to have a look at my work this is the patch:

I would like if you would comment and tell me if you don't like something
in it. Incremental patches are welcome of course.
Thanks!
Andrea
