  I can mention one. This is not a bugreport (yet).
  I can reproduce a complete hard-lock on 2.6.7 vanilla with the
following setup:
  * VMWare 4.5.2 (taints kernel, I know)
    * NIC is bridged
  * XFS filesystem
  * 4k stacks
  Inside vmware, I am running an instance of modified OpenBSD. With 4k
stacks, at least once a day the system locks hard. The shortest time
between two forced boots was about 20 minutes.
  The hang is triggered everytime by a single instance: guest OS sends a
DHCP-request, and this causes the linux kernel to hang. This does not
happen every time, but perhaps every fourth or fifth time. On one
occasion, it was the first time immediately after boot.
  Compiling 2.6.7 with 8k stacks has so far solved this issue. No random
hangs.
  Now, the reason this can't be any kind of bugreport is clear:
  1) kernel is tainted
  2) VMWare's modules are not yet updated to cope with 2.6.7 kernel
  So until VMWare updates their product, I consider this a bug in their
modules. When they do, I intend to test 4k stacks again. If the hangs
continue, then I shall see with their support whether it can be tracked
to their code or not.
  But at least at the moment if you wish to use VMWare and XFS, using 4k
stacks is, in my experience, asking for trouble.
