Andrew's comment on this:
	What's going on with the need_resched() tricks in there?  (Unobvious, needs
	a comment).  From my reading, it'll cause a caller to this function to hang
	for arbitrary periods of time if something if causing heavy scheduling
	pressure.
So I decided to remove it and return -EAGAIN, so userspace can retry.
But seems like it it does not. I thought glibc would handle that.
