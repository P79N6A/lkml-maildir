With PCI root/p2p bridge hotplug, the code dealing with the
hotplug (e.g. ACPI hotplug code) will have this information, not 
arch specific code. How about having the PCI subsystem export
an interface to set the nodemask, and have the arch or hotplug
code call it to change the defaults? That way, pci_alloc_bus()
simply sets the default and does not perform any callback.
Does that work for everyone?
