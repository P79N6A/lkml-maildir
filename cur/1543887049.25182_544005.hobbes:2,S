I'm the other way around but it's like saying "I like donkey poo better
than horse poo".  Let's accept that we have different tastes in poos.

Gee... what did you have in mind?  Twisted one.  :-P

Yeap, we'll need to either adjust set/get_wq_data() interface a bit or
open code it.  More on this later.

Yeap.

Yeap, I've used the term 'clearing' as more of a logical term - making
the pointer invalid, but is there any reason why we can't clear the
pointer itself?

But there are multiple cwq->lock's.  VALID can be set with one of other
cwq->lock's locked.

I didn't really get the smp_mb__before_spinlock() thing.  How are you
planning to use it?  spinlock() is already a read barrier.  What do you
gain by making it also a write barrier?

We're deep into per-cpu synchronization neverland and one can only trust
one's own Alice.  I can't say my Alice is better than yours but I'll try
to present why I like mine.
I like the VALID bit thing because we can make it look and act similar
to the relatively regular per-cpu locked enter/leave model people can
understand without too much difficulty.  If we change get/set_wq() such
that they contain the VALID bit thing inside them, the code can be
explained as simple (really?) locked enter/leave model.  That's why I
mentioned clearing the cwq pointer while locked.  The closer we stay to
the known model, the easier to understand and explain.
Maybe the bit shouldn't be called VALID but IGNORE, CACHE_ONLY or
somesuch.  The only reason why we can't do real enter/leave model is the
cwq caching for delayed works, so it might make more sense to mark the
pointer as invalid while being used for caching rather than the other
way around.
Thanks for working on this neverland thing.  :-)
