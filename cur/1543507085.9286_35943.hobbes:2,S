	Sometimes, (under 2.2.11) I have to kill pppd 3 or 4 times before it
hangs up and dies.  Also, after connecting, it takes a few minutes for
the interface to come up.  During this time, pppd does not appear to
lock the device.  I don't think this is a problem with pppd, because it
worked fine when I was using kernel ver. 2.2.5.   I've just had to deal
with it.

	I have to agree.  I haven't had anything that locks up the machine (the
Magic SysRq key is a life saver), but some things just don't seem to
work quite right.
