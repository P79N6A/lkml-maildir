Victor, the lowlatency patch takes care of all code paths that keep the
CPU for more than ~200-400 usecs without looking at current->need_resched.
While such work (the lowlatency patch) is always inexact because
source-level latency validation of 2 million lines of code is pretty much
impossible (although work on that front is advancing and some of the most
obvious abusers were fixed in 2.3), 'practical measurements' (Senno's
measurement tool + a loaded system) show good results. RTLinux is so
lowlevel (because it provides it's own small & atomic API orothogonal to
the base kernel) that source-level validation is much easier.
