In this case, they would have done the installation in the old
VAXen way. The final link would have been to the libraries on your
system. This is great if, and only if, they have faith in the libraries
that exist on your system. In the case of Digital, they would have
no choice since DEC didn't distribute source and let you hack around
with it. In our case, they really didn't have too much of a choice
but to distribute in with known working libraries.
Properly installed, it doesn't muck with your libraries. Its libraries
go into /opt/Office50/lib. You are certainly not going to link your
programs against it (unless you want to), you would need:
		gcc -L/opt/Office50/lib 
... on the command-line.
As long as the libraries are not put in the 'standard places' you
shouldn't have a problem. If you do chose to link against their
libraries, you have to provide a hint as to where to find them
when the program starts. This is where LD_LIBRARY_PATH is useful.
