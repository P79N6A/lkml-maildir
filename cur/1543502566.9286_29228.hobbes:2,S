Uh, it depends on what you are doing. If it's getting smooth GUI interaction
for multimedia then what you are saying above is incorrect. The use of select()
in that way is structurallly identical to a how a user space thread implementation
would work, so you might as well use a multithreading organizational structure.
Signals also suck for these purposes and don't allow for the flexibility of dealing
with multiprocessors like threads would.
