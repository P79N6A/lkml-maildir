Which begs another question -- why do we allocate the buffer page
lazily (only at the time of read(2) and write(2) and not at open(2))
in the case of normal attributes but prefer to do it during open(2)
itself for binary attributes? Note that the page (if allocated) is
freed during release() for both cases.
