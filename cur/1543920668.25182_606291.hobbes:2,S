I'm just guessing here, and certainly don't want to blame anyone, but
Jeff's original patch was from July, while the only date I can find for
Nick's commit is September 13th. So it was probably Nick who integrated
Jeff's changes into his commit (maybe thinking that Jeff's patch got
lost), not Jeff assimilating a subset of Nick's changes.
