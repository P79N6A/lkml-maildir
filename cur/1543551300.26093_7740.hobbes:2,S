Interesting, so up to 3GB works just fine with the new
VM and above that you can trigger all kinds of funny
errors ?
Could it be that the kernel fills most of low memory
with kernel data structures to manage high memory, so
that it doesn't have enough low memory left to do the
bookkeeping for the eepro card, etc???

Rik
