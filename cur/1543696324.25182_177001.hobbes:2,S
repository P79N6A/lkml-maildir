Wow, is the new scheduler that broken? cdrecord run as a realtime process
and should definitely keep going pretty much in spite of what you do. It's
realtime priority and locked in core IIRC. The only problem I've had is
running out of data burning from NFS mounted data, if I get a load of SPAM
the network gets slow. My fault for not spending the time to copy the data
twice or buy a burnfree device.
