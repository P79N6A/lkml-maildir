At the moment I don't have compiz manager
running, only fluxbox. But after thinking,
I did experience this(choppy screen)when using kexec,
i.g. starting a new kernel from a terminal inside the xserver
did create a messed up screen. Then(ctl+alt+del)disabling
the xserver, made things work the way they were supposed too.
I am running radeon on a macbook pro. If I can remember
at the time I was using kexec I did have radeon.(I'll try and reproduce 
this though).
In any case I think this is an xserver issue not a kernel(but thats just 
a guess).
I added a cc (hopefully it's the right one);
