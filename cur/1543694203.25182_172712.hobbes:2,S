You are right, at least for a PS/2 keyboard.  I finally managed to get
kbd-1.08 built and installed in a manner consistent with Red Hat 7.3 and
kernel 2.6.0-test7, AND had to make a bit more than the obvious edit to the
jp106 keymap file, and got it working for a jp106 PS/2 keyboard.  You are
right that it can be done without modifying defkeymap.c_shipped.  (I haven't
tried it with USB yet.)
