As you wrote, the comment does mention that you can't use this to convert
negative integers, and it WARN()'s if the user tries that anyway.

That's fine, I'll use strtonum() in any case. It turns out the behaviour
that we want is precisely what strtonum() offers, plus that also works for
negative integers, so we might as well just copy it over.
Andrew, I'll diff a new patch implementing strtonum(3) _not_ based on this
one, so you may safely drop this.
Thanks,
