While I have no particular problem merging your other driver since it
did not previously exist, I don't like much this one being massively
changed like this, particularly when you cannot test whether it breaks
its original platform (netwinder). I've also noticed that your patch
removes some locking, so I'm even doubting that it will not break
NetWinder.
A less risky solution would be to make a new driver of it (eg: w93977.c
instead of wdt977.c). Also, if you proceed like this, please do not
forget to write an entry in Configure.help.
Regards,
Willy
