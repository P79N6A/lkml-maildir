How to write a module to detect the state change (from
sleeping to running state) for all the processes in my
Linux system. Anyone know how to do that? A process
state will change from sleeping to running state 
after a system call (wake_up_process()), is there a
way so that my module can catch this system call , so
that i can get the pid of the process which
experienced a state changed?
Due to the remove of sys_call__table[], so i need
other way to doit...... pls comment
