Right, I'm not suggesting removing that: making the mmap_sem
read/write is fine, but yes, we still need that semaphore.  But as for
the "page faults would use an extra lock to protect against each
other" bit --- we already have another lock, the page table lock,
which can be used in this way, so ANOTHER lock should be unnecessary.
