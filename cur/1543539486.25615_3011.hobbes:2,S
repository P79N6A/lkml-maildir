I would much rather publicly expose myself after the patch had gone into the
kernel.  As it stands now in the worst light, people's hardware is going to
be destroyed because they  A) don't have a patched kernel and  B) most people
haven't a clue -how- to patch their kernel.  So they're hung out to dry
waiting until their distro has a patched kernel.
