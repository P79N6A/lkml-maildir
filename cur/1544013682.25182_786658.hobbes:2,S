Hey, I got one of those el-cheapo 32GB SD cards. I fully expected it
to be slow, but eating my data 3 times per month was unexpected even
for me.
I'm not even sure where the blame is. I certainly blame the Linux
documentation: there should be "DON'T USE CRAPPY SD CARDS" warning in
big bold letters somewhere. I guess mkfs.ext3 should just refuse to
make filesystem on them. (Of course, the manufacturer should have told
me that the card is crap; I can bet it can not even work with
VFAT/Windows).
Plus I'd hope some filesystem materializes that can handle 128KB
"block size"... because the el-cheapo card I have here is actually
pretty sane. It seems to store data I put on it, and should be safe to
use with huge block size...
