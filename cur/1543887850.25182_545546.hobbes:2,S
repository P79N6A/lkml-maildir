Ahh. Do we really need it that early?
Now, it's easy enough to just turn off CONFIG_X86_CMPXCHG64 (it really 
should be "8B" instead of "64", but that's another issue) for those 
things, and nobody should really care, but still, maybe we could re-do the 
early bits to be more polite to those VIA CPU's?
I thought the cmpxchg8b stuff was just used to page table setup. Do those 
things even _support_ PAE?
What else uses it? Early setup in real mode? What am I missing? My grep 
powers are waning..
