With Al Viro, at least, specifying that his code has been released *strictly* 
under GPLv2, this is impossible.

It is wrong when you look at the text of the GPLv2 only. When you look at how 
the "Open Source" community works it is clear that the "tit-for-tat" nature 
is a reality. No, it isn't mandated by GPLv2, but that is the "spirit" of the 
GPLv2 that most people who work on Open Source projects follow.
If you want a *REAL* and *CONTINUING* violation of the GPL just look at Herr 
Schillings "cdrecord", in which he places additional restrictions on peoples 
ability to modify the code with statements in the same such as "You must 
leave this check in place" or "You have to leave this comment in place" - 
even when the comment isn't part of the "licensing statement" mandated by the 
GPLv2. (if you want specifics I'll go download the source and pull them out)

It doesn't. But that it doesn't *MAKES* *NO* *DIFFERENCE* because, in 
practice, that is *EXACTLY* what happens anyway.

Which is not in question here. The objections Linus (and others) have to the 
GPLv3 may share some specifics with my own objections, but my own are that 
GPLv2 respects my freedoms in their entirety. GPLv3 restricts my freedoms 
because one (or more) of the people behind it have a political agenda. (No, 
that term isn't entirely accurate, but its the best one I have found for the 
situation. Explanation: We don't like the way the law of one or more 
munincipalities/political divisions/countries is written and rather than 
trying to get it changed through other channels, we are going to enforce the 
way we think it should be by using a related set of laws and the text of a 
license)

But it does. If you are going to distribute your own, modified version - in 
any way - you have to make the source available as well.
No, it doesn't require that you give back a version if you aren't distributing 
it, but in that case it hardly matters.
