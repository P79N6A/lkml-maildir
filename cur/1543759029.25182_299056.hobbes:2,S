You still haven't solved the problem of only a small group using the
development kernels.  Until a "stable" kernel is released, the majority
of kernel compilers will avoid any development kernel (even on this
mailing list!).
Two suggestions (one or both could be implemented):
How about appointing maintainers for 2.6.N kernels, whose responsibility
is apply stability and security patches for 3 months AND until 2.6.N+3 is
released.  So a series of 2.6.11.M kernels will appear until 2.6.14 and
2.6.11 is at least 3 months old.  This would given kernel developers
experience with such releases, but without the job being for the life of
the developer.
Also, add a list to the kernel.org web page about which kernels are
considered stable.  Listed stable kernels are those who have been
released for at least two weeks.
