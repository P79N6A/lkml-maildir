I have reports of a number of systems with issues like this. 
I have a machine here (A Fujitsu Siemens TX150 server) in which the SCSI 
controller actually corrupts the low level format of the hard disk if I 
enable ACPI! (low level reformat required!). The ACPI IRQ setup seems to work 
fine on it (as I assume it does on your system). Its just that there seems to 
be "something else" wrong in ACPI still. Weirdly enough, it can read sector 0 
of the HDD fine.. just any reads of any other sectors cause this corruption.
Now that I've got the bulk of the changes to the basic ACPI IRQ setup done, I 
can concentrate on these issues. Can you give me details of your system and 
the following items:
successful dmesg
dmesg from a failed boot
/proc/acpi/dsdt
/proc/interrupts
