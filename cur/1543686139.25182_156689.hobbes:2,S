The CAST5 cipher from the kerneli cryptoapi has been tested against
basically every architecture we could get our hands on, using the
test vectors supplied in the RFC.
If you'd like, I can submit a patch.
On the other hand, there really is no point adding CAST5, as
much stronger, much faster algorithms are already in place.
Lastly, if somebody really wants to put CAST in the kernel, I'd suggest
going with CAST6, the AES candidate specified in RFC-2612.
