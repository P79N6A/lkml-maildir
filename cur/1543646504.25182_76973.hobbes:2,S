bkbits.net is a free service.  It costs us about $1600/month in cash
to run it, that doesn't count any salaries, that's just fixed costs.
If rsync and/or ftp didn't use about 100x as much bandwidth to do what
BK does we'd have already done what you are asking.  We simply can't
afford it.
But as I said to someone else, why doesn't someone register "nobkbits.net"
and use BK to mirror the repos and then provide the tarballs/patches as
you see fit.
I'm quite happy to help someone set this up, I'm just not willing to 
foot the bill.  The bandwidth costs will kill you.  kernel.org could
do this and that would be fine with me.
