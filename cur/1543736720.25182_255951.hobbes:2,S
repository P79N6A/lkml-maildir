helo denis,
helo andrew,
denis is right, in my opinion, ms would never publish a docuemnt which
shows that linux is much more faster then there own priducts.
i would like to recommand a book to you, andrew. the book rebel code
written by glynn moody ia a great funny book which deals with the open
source philosophy and the bad benchmark tests.
it also explains how many the linux community influenced the set up of
the test machine in relation to microsoft.
you should read it, it's a great book.
