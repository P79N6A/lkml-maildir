But when do you need the "clean + rm .config*" behavior? I don't see that 
to be such a common case.
That's why I think two targets are enough, "clean" to remove the files
generated during the build and "distclean" to remove all other extra stuff
to. And just keep mrproper to be an alias for distclean, since that's what
"mrproper" traditionally was (AFAIK, Linus used it that way).
