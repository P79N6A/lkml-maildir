Thats true. Estimating bandwidth by quantity of submitted I/O should be 
good enough. Doing too many seek
time calculations is not only complex but may be useless if the attached 
device is doing its own reordering (an increasingly likely
scenario for servers).  I guess one could do some simple accounting such 
as 1+x per request where 1 accounts for the fixed "cost"  of a request 
on I/O bandwidth and x is a request size dependent cost.  I'm looking 
forward to your next version to see what are your thoughts.

I'll try and get out a CKRM variant of CFQ soon - anyway another version 
is needed to fit into the next version of  CKRM core api's that
were published on ckrm-tech in the past week
    
http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum=ckrm-tech
Please consider joining the ckrm-tech mailing list 
(

) and/or cc'ing it 
on CFQ changes for I/O priorities.
