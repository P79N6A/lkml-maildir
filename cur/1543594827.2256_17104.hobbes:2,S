The correct way of installing for a target machine is to use
  make INSTALL_MOD_PATH=foo modules_install
You need to mkdir -p foo/lib/modules first.  Everything is installed in
foo/lib/modules/`uname -r` instead of /lib/modules so you do not
disturb your compile system.
There is also make INSTALL_PATH to specify where vmlinuz and System.map
are stored for make zlilo and make install.
