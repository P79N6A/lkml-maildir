Hello!
When I connect a usb device, dmseg tells me which special file the device is
attached on.
This is sda1 or something like : /dev/scsi/host1/bus0/target0/lun0
I would like to catch this information in a script.
Can anybody tell me how can i do ?
 I think this is a kernel information; how can I get it ?
Thanks for your help.
