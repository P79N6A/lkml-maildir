But who will DO it ? AFAIK right now vfat does not work at all :-(( But yes,
it looks like good idea since right now you can not SEE short names but can
USE them (rm shortnam.ext will remove file, for example; and you can not
create new file with existing short name, etc). It's frustrating even without
backup problems (in fact backup problems are not THAT bad: just use doslfnbk
from dosemu :-)
