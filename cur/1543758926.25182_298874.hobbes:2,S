The pertinent question for a point release (2.6.X.Y) would simply be 
"does a 2.6.11 user really need this fix?"

I think Linus's "even/odd" proposal is an admission that 2.6.X releases 
need some important fixes after it hits kernel.org.
Otherwise 2.6.X is simply a constantly indeterminent state.
We need to serve users, not just make life easier for kernel developers ;-)
