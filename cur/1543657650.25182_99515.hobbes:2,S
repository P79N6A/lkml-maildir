Radeonfb almost works now, but there are some problems
with setting (and resetting) the resolution.
I use a flat screen so anything except 1280x1024 is
hopeless to look at.  So I want that from the start.
Just booting with video=radeon gives me a 640x400
mode.  There's some initial garbage (looks like early boot
messages converted to graphichs at the wrong resolution)
on the screen, but that isn't a problem.  The low resolution
is, though.
I first tried "fbset 1280x1024-60", which changed
the resolution, but the console was still a
small 640x400 thing in the upper left corner of
the 1280x1024 display.  Not very useful.
So I tried booting with video=radeon:1280x1024-32@60
That gave me a blank screen, the monitor complained
about "no signal".
But I logged in blind, and ran fbset 1280x1024-60
again.  This gave me the console I want.
1280x1024 resolution, with 160x64 characters.
I could put fbset in a init script, but that is
fragile if I get some error before that init
script runs. I should really see the
console all the time.
Another problem comes up when running X.  Switching
from X to some virtual console always gives me the
"no signal" thing, and I have to type the fbset
command blind before the console becomes
visible.  Switching back to X is never a problem.
This is a UP machine, P4 processor, using preempt.
I use a radeon 7500 in an AGP slot.
