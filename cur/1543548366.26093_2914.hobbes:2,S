Maybe it's that just 25 years in this industry made you for Alzheimer,
since
you should know that the first versions of UNIX where actually written
in
plain assembler. So C certainly isn't what made for it's success in
first place.
And then please just compare C with any other modern programming
language like 
pascal/modula/java/C++/objective/C/ADA or anything elese. From all of
them
C is the most "assembler alike" language and still the most widely used
for OS programming out there: BeOS, NT, UNIX, QNX, VMS, CP/M, DOS, Mach, 
and so on and so on.
Second: GDB is DREADFULL in terms of user friendliness...
