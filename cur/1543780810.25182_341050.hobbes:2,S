that's quite borderline; if it was my code I'd not use a rwsem for that
ratio (my own rule of thumb, based on not a lot other than gut feeling)
is a 10/1 ratio at minimum... but it's not so low that it screams for
removing it. However.... it might well make your code a lot simpler so
it might still be worth simplifying.
