Any attempt to  setup an irq >= NR_IRQS will crash, because for instance 
entry.c interrupt stubs are an array of NR_IRQS entries...NR_IRQ_VECTORS

We do support irq sharing among devices, but not vector sharing among 
irqs. For that the handler should loop through irq_vector[] to find 
every index, index != irq, irq_vector[index] == irq_vector[irq].
