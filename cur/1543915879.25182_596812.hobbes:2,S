I just can say sorry. But at that time, I'm not sure the former
specific patch to net/ipv4/af_inet.c would be applied, and then I
realized that change should be done with every subsystem in the kernel
source, so I regenerate a new patch for the whole net/ subsystem; In
this situation, I think I should give an announcement to make the
former patch deprecated, shouldn't it?
However, I'll be more cautious with patches.
