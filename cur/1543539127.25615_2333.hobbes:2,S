If nothing but web browsing is working, try:
echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_no_pmtu_disc
If it works after that, someone is (incorrectly) blocking PMTU. Read more about
it at 
http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/firewall-seen.html
You should really try to find who is blocking PMTU and convince him to stop,
since disabling PMTU makes things slower. Lowering your MTU isn't enough, since
the sending side (the web browser) will still try to use PMTU, trying 1500
first.
