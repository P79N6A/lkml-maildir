My point is that the modprobe will fail if it is passed an unrecognised
module parameter (won't it?)
So if we're worried about not breaking existing setups, we should retain
this module parameter as a do-nothing thing, maybe with a
this-is-going-away warning printk, too.

Just idle curiosity regarding how much testing it had seen.
Generally one would expect things to be OK, but there can be startup
ordering problems.
The most common problem is that the module simply doesn't load because it's
using some not-exported-to-modules symbol
