Unless X is involved, console switching happens entirely within the
kernel.  See drivers/char/vt.c, include/linux/vt.h.  Mingetty (and
agetty, and util-linux getty) don't do anything.
The X server source will show you how to trap console switches - but
you probably don't want to.
See also the "screen" program for an idea of how to implement
something very similar purely in user space.
