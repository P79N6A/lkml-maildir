I see the point and will port to v6 (have asked colleages for help). 
Until then, I will keep an up-to-date (-mm) patch in the tarball
http://www.erg.abdn.ac.uk/users/gerrit/udp-lite/files/udplite_linux.tar.gz
This has applications as well. I would value any more input: the suggestion to 
use SOCK_DGRAM has already been integrated and proved a really good idea (much less 
to patch, cleaner code). Usually an update is there on the same day the new kernel 
comes out.
Thank you for your replies and comments, I will be back when the v6 side is ready.
