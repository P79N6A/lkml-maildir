Subject: 2.3.47+ TCP woes traced to tulip driver

Figured out why i was having wierd TCP problems with 
2.3.47pre8 and newer kernels (ICMP and DNS working, SMTP, 
FTP, HTTP, telnet, all crapping out).  It's the tulip driver.
Applied 2.3.47pre8 chunk at a time until i started seeing
TCP problems, and culprit is the new tulip driver code
that started being put into the kernel at that patch level.
i've upgraded the rest of the kernel to 2.3.48 then 2.3.49
while keeping the tulip driver at 2.3.47pre7, and TCP works
fine.  If i upgrade the tulip code as well, i experience 
networking problems.
Some interesting hardware details:
Tried 2 DLink cards in my home box, one with 21040 chip, 
one with 21041, both labelled DE-530CT.  Same packet
problems with both cards.  i use 10base2 to connect here.  
My home box has a motherboard with K6-3 and ALi Alladin V 
chipset.
The gateway box at home runs 2.3.49, and uses an old NE2000 
clone ISA card on 10base2.  It runs fine with no packet 
problems.
At the office i have a box running 2.3.49, and it also
has a DLink DE-530CT with 21040, and it *doesn't* have 
these networking problems.  That card is on 10baseT.  All 
the ethercards in the computers at the office are DLink 
DE-530CT, either with 21040 or 21041 chip.
This 2.3.49 box at the office uses an harddisk that's  
copied from the box that sees packet problems, so all the 
software's the same.  One works, the other don't.  This 
working office box has a motherboard with K6-2 and PIIX4 
chipset.
Totally unwarranted observations:
So the tulip drivers that're in 2.3.47pre8 and newer kernels
work in one box and not in another, both using the same
brand and label of ethercard, with the obvious difference 
being one's on 10baseT, while the other's on a 10base2 LAN
with a gateway box that uses an ancient NE2000 clone ISA 
card.
How does this sound?  i'm too stupid to pull apart the 
tulip code so this is likely as far as i can go.  i'll
be happy to try stuff if the tulip maintainers want a dumb
guinea pig.
