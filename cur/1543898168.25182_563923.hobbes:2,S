Is that conjecture, or do you have evidence to that effect?  Most users 
of this file are using it via the glibc interfaces, and there probably 
aren't all that many users of it in the first place.
This was debated in some detail earlier in this thread.
(Note: this patch is still wrong, since it appends the new fields in the 
wrong place.)
