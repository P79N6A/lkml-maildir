Takashi-san, have you ever investigated using kprobes to
implement this feature?  It seems a perfect fit, and would
allow support on several architectures other than just x86
and x86_64.
If kprobes does not meet your needs completely, it could
be trivially extended to do so.
I think implementing something like this from scratch is
not a good idea when we have much of the needed logic and
infrastructure already.
