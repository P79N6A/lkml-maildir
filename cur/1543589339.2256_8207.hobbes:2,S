Hi all,
I just compiled 2.4.4 and are running it on a Serverworks LE motherboard.
Whenever I try to add a write-combining region, it gets rejected. I took a peek
in the arch/i386/kernel/mtrr.c and found that this is just as expected with
v1.40 of the code. It is great that the mtrr code checks and prevents the user
from doing something that could eventually lead to data corruption. Using
write-combining on PCI acesses can lead to this on certain LE revisions but
_not_ all (only rev < 5). Therefore please consider my small patch to allow the
good ones to be able to use write-combining. I have several rev 06 and they are
working fine with this patch.
Best regards,
