You still have to calculate dependancies and such for
anything built modular. Also a bunch of code built into
the bzImage changes if things are built modular.
the two comparisons aren't equal.  Additionally,
you haven't factored in the fact that 'make dep'
is no longer needed. This accounts for a big chunk
of time on 2.4 kernel builds.

oranges to oranges means _exactly_ the same options
(where they haven't changed from 2.4 -> 2.6) are
set/unset. Anything else is totally bogus.
If you find things are still taking phenomenally
long times to build, then something is wrong somewhere.
Don't you find it strange you're the only person
to have complained about this ? If it was as big
a problem as you're suggesting, those of us who
do nothing but build kernels all day would be up in arms.
