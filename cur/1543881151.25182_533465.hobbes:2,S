OK, it's better now. All tasks equally run. X is still somewhat jerky, even
at nice -19. I'm sure it happens when it's waiting in the other array. We
should definitely manage to get rid of this if we want to ensure low latency.
Just FYI, the idle is often close to zero and the load is often close to 30,
even if still fluctuating :
