Subject: PCMCIA slot 1 invisible under 2.4.0-test10-pre3

When I tried 2.4.0-test10-pre3 on my IBM Thinkpad 380XD (the 233 MHz
flavor), PCMCIA slot #1 (the lower one) seemed to be dead: inserting and
removing cards gave me no beeps and no log messages.  Slot #0 (the upper
one) behaved fine.  It didn't matter whether I had one or two cards in.
test10-pre2 seemed to have the same problem.  test10-pre1 (and its
predecessors) work fine.
I have CONFIG_PCMCIA == CONFIG_CARDBUS == 'y' and (on the userspace side)
pcmcia-cs 3.1.20.
