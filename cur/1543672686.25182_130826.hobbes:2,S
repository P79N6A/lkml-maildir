I checked the numbers that are in arch/sparc64/kernel/ioctl32.o
and found none that uses more than 9 bits for the size field,
while every architecture has at least 13 bits space. There may
of course be other ioctls that can not live with 12 bit size
fields and it's probably a bad idea to require special-casing
these in the compat code.
