Actually, it is pretty stable.  It OOM's a bit more easily, but that
isn't a surprise to anyone, especially with the smaller amount of
ZONE_NORMAL.  I routinely run kernel compiles for days on it with no
problems.
That is, of course, a NUMA-Q.  We're hoping to get a Summit box which is
just as big sometime soon.  It will be much more interesting.
