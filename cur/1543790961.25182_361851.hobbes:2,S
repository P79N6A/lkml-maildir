starting from 2.6.0 (2 years ago) i have the following bug.
link: 
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2579
and 
https://bugtrack.alsa-project.org/alsa-bug/view.php?id=230
fast summary:
when playing audio and using a bit the harddisk (i.e. md5sum of a 200mb
file)
i hear noises, related to disk activity. more hd is used, more chicks
and ZZZZ noises happen.
linux 2.4.x and windows has no problems, perfect.
tried module/standalone alsa drivers.
Please fix that...2 years' bug!
Ready to test any patch/solution.
