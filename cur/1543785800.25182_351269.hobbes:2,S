Unless there is an example, which really needs this, I don't think this is 
a good idea. Mainly because I don't like the idea of running random 
scripts during the config process, I prefer to keep this a little under 
control.

This will almost certainly not happen. The autoconfig rules would also be 
useful in the graphical config front ends and something like this would 
prevent it.
