I assume that the double negative here is accidental and you mean that 
this scheduler isn't clearly better than the current one.

Not a rewrite just some major surgery to one small part (at least when 
compared to nicksched, staircase and the SPA schedulers).  This doesn't 
effect the run queue structure or the load balancing mechanisms.  Or, 
for that matter, even the bonus mechanism itself other than the 
calculation of the bonus as the way the bonus is applied once calculated 
is unchanged.

Probably not in its present form but with a little refinement I think 
that it may provide a solution.  As I see it the current strategy of 
trying to identify interactive tasks and then giving them bonuses is the 
cause of most of the remaining problems because it's hard to do and if 
you get it wrong and identify non interactive tasks as interactive tasks 
it can have long lasting bad effects on the scheduling quality.  So I 
think a strategy that makes bonuses more ephemeral has some chance of 
success.  Only time and testing will tell.
I think that the big advantage of the patch (at the moment) is that it's 
easy to understand.  Which in turn makes it easier to tweak.
