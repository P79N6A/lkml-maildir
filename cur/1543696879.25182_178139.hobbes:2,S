I don't think this will help in his case. I believe the 745 comes with a 
more recent flavour of the 5595, not 96x. It looks like they have changed 
the pirq routing registers before 96x appeared. So I think it's not enough 
to decide which scheme to use depending on the device id. Btw, I still 
like my suggestion to use the pci revision id of the router function 
(1039:0008) which we had discussed at that time. ;-)
Roland, could you send the output from "lspci -vxxx -d:8" please for 
verification?
