Pavel is right: the other they I made the mistake of running (as a normal
user) "cp /dev/zero file.txt" in our production system instead of "cp
/dev/null file.txt" and the CPU utilization went way up and nothing could
get done. The server was useless until I figured out what was going on
and killed the cp. This really is a DoS attack :-(
I haven't tried Andreas' patch, though.
