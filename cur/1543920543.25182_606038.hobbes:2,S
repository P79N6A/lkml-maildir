an update on this issue:
shortly, SD_BALANCE_FORK is required to trigger this problem and
hence, only NUMA machines could have been affected by it (and only
ia64 and x86 have SD_BALANCE_FORK in SD_NODE_INIT).
more details:
it's perfectly legitimate for 'rq->cfs.curr' to be NULL in
task_new_fair() in the case when this_cpu != task_cpu(p) (p -- is a
newly created task).
why this_cpu != task_cpu(p) :
do_fork() --> copy_process() --> sched_fork() -->
cpu = sched_balance_self(this_cpu, SD_BALANCE_FORK)
chose a different cpu for the new task and there is _no_
'class_sched_fair' task running on this cpu at the moment (that's why
rq->cfs.curr == NULL).
[ thanks a lot to Paul for providing debugging information ]
btw., it's not the 'curr->vruntime < se->vruntime' part in
task_new_fair() that gave us the oops (it's only executed in the case
of this_cpu == task_cpu(p)) _but_ it's rather:
[*] check_spread(cfs_rq, curr) which also accesses 'curr->vruntime'.

2 checks are required as 'current' and rq->cfs.curr are not the same :-)
It also should work if we just get rid of [*] or add an adiitional
(curr != NULL) check there.
just as a additional observation:
there are lots of per-cpu threads (like events/cpu, ksoftirq/cpu,
etc.) being created on start-up (x NUMBER_OF_CPUS) and SD_SCHED_FORK
(actually, sched_balance_self() from sched_fork()) is just an overhead
in this case...
although, sched_balance_self() is likely to be responsible for a minor
% of the time taken to create a new context so optimizing it away
(esp. for some corner cases) won't improve the start-up time
noticeable.
