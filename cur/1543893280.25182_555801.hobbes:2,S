Hi,
gregkh-driver-sysfs-use-singly-linked-list-for-sysfs_dirent-tree.patch breaks
suspend to RAM on HPC nx6325 (x86_64).
With this patch applied I get a general protection fault in mutex_lock+0x15
(kernel/mutex.c:91), called by sysfs_hash_and_remove() (fs/sysfs/inode.c:298),
called by threshold_cpu_callback(), called from _cpu_down().
Without the patch, the suspend to RAM works (the resume doesn't - there is
another patch that prevents the video from being restored after the resume -
but I'll carry out the bisection tomorrow. ;-)]
Greetings,
Rafael
