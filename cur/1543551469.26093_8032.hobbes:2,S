I've a bug report pending for NFSv3 on 2.2.18pre15aa1, it's not paranoia.
But I'm not really talking about 2.2.18pre15, it may be a bug in the aa
patchkit. OTOH Andi couldn't reproduce it I will try soon too.

Could you try to use 8192 r/w size? That doesn't happen with the aa patchkit
either without changing the packet size.
