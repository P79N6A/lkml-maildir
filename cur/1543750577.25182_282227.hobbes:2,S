Now, this message did bounce, and the bounce message is damned 
confusing...

     Host coyote.coyote.den not found
The following recipients did not receive this message:
     <""@coyote.coyote.den>
Please reply to Postmaster@verizon.net
if you feel this message to be in error.
--------------------------
coyote.coyote.den is indeed the name of this machine, but I should be 
known to the outside world as gene.heskett AT verizon.net.
So the $64,000 question is how did that domain name even get to the 
outside world.
Here is the complete header from the message that elicited that 
response from verizons servers.

And there sure as heck isn't any mention of 'coyote.coyote.den' in 
that.
So whats the deal verizon???  But asking for an answer is like talking 
to a stone wall, verizon has been congenitally (or surgically) 
rendered mute by their legal dept.  I've yet to get a reply to any of 
the several questions I've sent to the Postmaster@verizon.net black 
hole.
They have a private newsgroup I used to inhabit, but the snr was so 
horrible I gave it up, my remaining lifetime is too short to spend it 
argueing east bergen nj politics.
