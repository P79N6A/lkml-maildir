That makes sense, but ...  there are BIOSes that actually list nested
resources, e.g., 
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=9514#c29
 :
  [000000290 - 000000294]  Motherboard resources
  [000000290 - 00000029F]  Motherboard resources
We'd have to make sure we don't start with the 0x290-0x294 resource,
because then we'll fail when we try to reserve 0x290-0x29f, and we
really should avoid using the 0x295-0x2f9 piece as well.
And even if we do figure out the "outermost" resources, I'd worry
that some BIOS will have separate ACPI devices that have overlapping
resources.  Then Murphy's Law says that we'll find the device with
the smaller resource first, reserve it, then find a device with an
enclosing resource, and leave something unreserved.
Maybe that's still better than a quirk; I don't know.  I guess it's
pretty ugly either way.
