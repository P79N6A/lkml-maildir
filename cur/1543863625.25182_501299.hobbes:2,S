Oh, the page_remove_rmap BUG, page_mapcount negative.
Sorry for the deafening silence, see I was CC'ed but dropped the ball.
That's surely no reason to dump 2.6.19.x, you'll find the occasional
such report on every(?) release since page mapcount went into 2.6.7.
Oftentimes it's bad RAM (try memtest86), sometimes it's a bad driver
(probably the case for the tainted P report appended to your untainted
one), sometimes it's unidentified memory corruption.  Not once (except
during experimental patch testing) has it been proved due to an actual
VM problem.
