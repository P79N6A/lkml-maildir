I was actually referring to the PPC's time base register, which is
about the closest equivalent to the x86's TSC. I'm pretty sure it's a
non-optional architecture feature (but I don't have my books handy),
and I believe this usually gets wired to the clock driving the memory
bus (typically 133MHz), but I've only worked with embedded PPC so I
have no idea how it's set up in commodity hardware.
