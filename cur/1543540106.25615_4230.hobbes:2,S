No I'm not kidding.  Based on some comments by Linus earlier, he is
advocating putting the kernel source tree out of the way of glibc and
other "standard" development tools.  /usr/local seems a better fit to me
than /lib/modules.  According to FHS /lib is for essential shared
libraries and kernel modules.  It also says one of the uses of
/usr/local is for local source code.  It's also one of the few places
which shouldn't get clobbered in a system software upgrade.
It was an opinion; I'm expressing my 'druthers, if you will.  I know
others don't agree.  I see where it looks as if Linus is leaning towards
/lib/modules anyway, so I'll adapt.  Or I'll be contrary and make
appropriate local changes in the source code.  As long as Linus keeps it
as a self-contained entity it won't matter anyway.
