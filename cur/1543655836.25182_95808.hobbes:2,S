Yes, the two keys that do not generate an event in X syslog these errors:
atkbd.c: Unknown key (set 2, scancode 0x176, on isa0060/serio0) pressed.
atkbd.c: Unknown key (set 2, scancode 0x176, on isa0060/serio0) released.
atkbd.c: Unknown key (set 2, scancode 0x11e, on isa0060/serio0) pressed.
atkbd.c: Unknown key (set 2, scancode 0x11e, on isa0060/serio0) released.
where 0x176 is the PLAY key and 0x11e is the PREV key.
Incidently, the FORWARD key is giving the same keycode as the main
kb's Pause key.
