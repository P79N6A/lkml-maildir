If srvTcp->tsk is NULL then the thread (cifs_demultiplex_thread) is 
getting ready to exit and kthread_stop would not be needed.
It would probably be possible to recode this so we don't need to call 
kthread_stop at all (send_sig is apparently required to wake up this 
thread when blocked in certain places in the tcp stack - and in 
combination with the existing flags might be good enough) - but I don't 
know if it would make it simpler.    Fortunately there is no race, a few 
lines after srvTcp->tsk is set to zero by the cifs_demultipex_thread, it 
will sleep briefly before exiting (kthread_stop won't be called on a 
thread that does not exist).
That section of code in fs/cifs/connect.c now looks like:
2071                         if (srvTcp->tsk) {
2072                                 struct task_struct *tsk;
2073 
                                /* If we could verify that kthread_stop would
2074 
                                   always wake up processes blocked in
2075 
                                   tcp in recv_mesg then we could remove the
2076                                    send_sig call */
2077                                 send_sig(SIGKILL,srvTcp->tsk,1);
2078                                 tsk = srvTcp->tsk;

Re: 2.6.22-rc1-mm1 cifs_mount oops
Hi,
I have one problem about this:  after the srvTcp->tsk is set to NULL
(maybe the thread is  still there, isn't it?), is the kthread still
needed to be stopped by calling kthread_stop()? If it is true, then
the task_struct should be saved before send_sig like my patch:
                        if (srvTcp->tsk) {
+                               struct task_struct * tsk = srvTcp->tsk;
                               send_sig(SIGKILL,srvTcp->tsk,1);
-                               kthread_stop(srvTcp->tsk);
+                               kthread_stop(tsk);
Regards
dave
