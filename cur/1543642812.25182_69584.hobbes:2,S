Linus, normally I would agree with you on this, but...
(1) We can't always handle it.  The current code implements a heuristic,
which is not always correct.  When it gets it wrong....
(2) show_trace() was proving ineffective in bringing the bad commands to
light so they might be fixed
(3) Given that we think we've fixed all of these bad initiators, the BUG()
really is something that should never happen.
