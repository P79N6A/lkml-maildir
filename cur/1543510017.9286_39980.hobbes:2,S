I thought AFS was ACLs were implemented similarly to the DFS - ACLs emulated
in an authentication server... I didn't know that Coada even had ACLS, only
a network sync technique for disconnected operation (prevents a lot of
authentication capability... the user walks off taking the files, then hacks
at them). The translation of UUID's would almost have to be done via a table
lookup, but hopefully done in the filesystem layer (unless Linux is the
server).

Sounds like a graduate project someplace, huh :)
I've been looking for ACLs (and MLS ...) but until real recently hadn't
seen anything that was sufficently production level (well beta at least).
I'm also watching the freeswan (IPsec) and RSBAC projects for a possible
MLS based PC system for consolidated console system (console handling for
multiple hosts, combined timestamped console log, positive authentication
for remote connections, labeling of audit data and log files...). It could
also be used for archiving audit analysis and be a security analysis system.
I'm using a Linux IA pc for that now, but minus much of the audit logs and
security tracing. Works fine for now (2 Origin 2000, 1 Origin 200, 1 Onyx2,
and 4 Cray systems).
Combining all of this (misc security projects) into one server system for
Kerberos authentication would also make a very difficult system to hack.
