Or the kernel is failing to transmit a request for some odd reason.  I've
seen a few machines show odd lockups like this.  They only started doing
that once the filer was moved *ahem* across town (on the other side of a
DS3)
I only say the "no more tasks" thing once to a new F520 -- but it was
setup very weird to handle news storage (and it was running uncertified
Data ONTAP.)
