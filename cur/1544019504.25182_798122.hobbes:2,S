Yes, GCC has byteswap builtins on x86 documented as follows:
 -- Built-in Function: int32_t __builtin_bswap32 (int32_t x)
     Returns X with the order of the bytes reversed; for example,
     `0xaabbccdd' becomes `0xddccbbaa'.  Byte here always means exactly
     8 bits.
 -- Built-in Function: int64_t __builtin_bswap64 (int64_t x)
     Similar to `__builtin_bswap32', except the argument and return
     types are 64-bit.
These were only added as of GCC 4.3 though.
