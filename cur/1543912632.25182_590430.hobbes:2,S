This is a follow-up...
After a huge pain in the rear upgrading from a 
2.6.11++ to a 2.6.23-rc3 (I'll give the powerpc
folks a 'piece' of my mind on that front) - the 
NFS hang problem that I was experiencing on the 
older kernel is NOT occurring on this new version.
Now what do I do?
Is the net/sunrpc net/nfsx pieces isolated enough 
from the rest of the kernel that I could fork-lift 
it back to the 2.6.11 (or is that really a lost cause).
Thanks for any/all feedback on this front!

Can you reproduce the problem with the current kernel? (Say 2.6.22 or
later?)
