	Hello,
	I'm having problems with cdrecord 1.9 and kernels 2.2.17pre15 and
pre16, cdrecord complains about being unable to mmap /dev/zero 
Invalid argument. Cannot get mmap for 4198400 Bytes on /dev/zero.
After stracing it, I found the following:
mmap(NULL, 4198400, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED|MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0) = -1
EINVAL (Invalid argument)
	Any clue?
	- german
