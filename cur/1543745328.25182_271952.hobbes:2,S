Doesn't this make things worse?  The old problem was that
seekdir/telldir were broken (which we already knew for certain cases
like hash collisions).  But with...

don't we end up silently ignoring all dirents with a major hash <= 1,
even for unbroken getdents() with no intervening seekdir?  Previously
we'd at least fill them into the rbtree, so sequential readdir would
find them even if the hash collided.  Now we'll skip them entirely.
If we're going to do this, I think we need to stuff . and .. into the
rbtree with the right hashes, but without ignoring other existing
dirents with colliding hashes.
