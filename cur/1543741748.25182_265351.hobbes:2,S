Hi,
In Gentoo everything goes to /usr/bin or /usr/sbin except very basic 
things that are instaled in /bin or /sbin and binary-only packages that 
are instaled in /opt (very good idea).
Yes, Linux (or UNIX) directory structure should be changed years ago but 
nobody (except GOBO Linux I think) is going to do it. That will require 
patching realy big amount of code and changing some standards. If somebody 
has time for it feel free to contact me, and I will tell him (or her) what 
should be changed to produce The New Directory Standard That Breaks 
Everything But Is The Best And Most Sane In The World (TM)... :-)
