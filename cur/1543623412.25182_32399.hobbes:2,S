Kevin,
The comments you responded to were someone else's attached to the
original post, but since you addressed me I'll respond.   These
gentlemen were telling us what we should use and what we should think
about their views of open source.   Those opinions are fine, but Alan
and other folks bascially said it is a matter of personal choice and
freedom.  I'm sorry that we are  advocates of freedom rather than
mindless lumps of clay you can twist to your will.
I have a lot of bugs to fix and code to get ready to post, and will not
respond to this thread beyond this post.
Jeff
