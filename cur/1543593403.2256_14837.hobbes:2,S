Hi all!
Enjoying the -ac2 kernel except for one minor thing: it locks up.
Problem occurs whenever large amounts of data are transferred across the 
network. This includes web pages, iso cd images, and compressed files.
I can transfer large amounts of data from the internet and to the internet 
however.
It is a hardlock, I cannot even get the SysRq key to help me out.
System specs:
P-III 550
256MB RAM (1 DIMM)
Abit SH6 (i815 based) Motherboard
Using onboard Video/Audio
Kernel 2.4.5-ac2
Debian GNU/Linux 2.2rev3
Realtek 8139B (see attached dmesg.output file)
10BaseT Network with 128K Satellite link to outside world
Tried protocols:
Samba
FTP
HTTP
NFS
If you need any more info let me know.
Thanks!
