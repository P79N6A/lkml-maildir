you will most likely have to recompile your iptables userspace program.
The owner match has recently undergone some changes in the structure
used for communication between kernel and userspace.
btw: you can easily match ftp data sessions (if you use
ip_conntrack_ftp) by matching with "-m helper --helper ftp"
please direct netfilter/iptables related questions to
netfilter@lists.netfilter.org in the future.
