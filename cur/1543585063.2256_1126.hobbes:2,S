I think the LABEL is a good intermediate step for people not using LVM.
It basically allows your /etc/fstab to not have _any_ device names in it.
I'm not sure I would be happy with auto-mounting swap partitions,
especially because this would overwrite any data in the partition.  Bad.

LVM will handle the disk and "partition" naming and size issues.
It does NOT currently handle the fstype names, but this _could_ be
determined via magic numbers, as now.  In the "(struct dentry *)->vfsmnt"
thread, I was trying to work out a way to get mountpoint information
for LVM.  In the end, I think I will store most of the /etc/fstab line
into a field in the LV header, so it is easily retrievable.  This would
also include the fstype, and mount/dump/fsck options.  It would _not_
store the device name.
The proposed solution would be to have mount(8) write the mount info to
the disk (for logical volumes only, of course) at mount time.  I suppose
the fs type, options, mountpoint could come from either /etc/fstab or
from the command-line, since mount(8) is already parsing all of this info.
Cheers, Andreas
