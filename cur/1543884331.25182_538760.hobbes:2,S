Other than the detail of allowing a newline from doing:
	echo > cpus
to work, I'm ok with this patch.  It passes my cpuset_test,
and seems to allow unpopulating cpusets, as advertised.
Aha - as I was writing this, I noticed that the command:
  echo -n '' > cpus
does -not- work!  The echo command recognizes that as a write
of zero non-null bytes, and skips the write altogether.
We have to add the code to handle an input line consisting of
just a bare newline, to mean an empty mask.  Well, we don't
-have- to.  But writing a single nul byte in shell script will
challenge most shell script hackers.
