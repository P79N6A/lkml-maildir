thank you very much Pavel
The results are a bit unclear, I took a 2.6.22-rc4 with beep.
Logged into KDE.
(hardware: Dell Latitude D810)
S = successfull resume
D = had to resume 2 times, that means when pressing the power button the
LED goes from blinking to on and after a few seconds it goes back to
blinking, but without a beep in between; after pressing the power button
a second time resume is successfull
F = resume failes, NO beep
-run 1: D D F
-run 2: D D D(some X garbadge) F
-run 3: S S S S S S F
-run 4: S S F
-run 5: D F
Very odd, nothing was changed in between and after each F i switched it
off... because it was dead.
With 2.6.19.7 i have never seen it fail.
