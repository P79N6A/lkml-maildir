The function provided by "hidden" is a necessary element but not
sufficient. I suppose arp_filter
has to be combined with the hidden patch. I dislike hiding an interface,
and the hidden patch is no
longer included in the major distributions which makes delivering a
solution difficult.
In this example, 1.1.1.11 2.2.2.22 are virtual ip's which can float between
boxes and interfaces.
I want virtual ip 1.1.1.11 to be known to clients through eth0 node1
(2.2.2.22 eth1 node2). Node1
can redirect 1.1.1.11 traffic to eth0 node2.
                          node1                                 node2
                      lo:1 1.1.1.11                          lo:1 1.1.1.11
                      lo:2 2.2.2.22                          lo:2 2.2.2.22
              eth0   1.1.1.1     eth1 2.2.2.1         eth0  1.1.1.2   eth1
2.2.2.2
              eth0:1 1.1.1.11
eth1:1 2.2.2.22
On node1, does hiding loopback hide 1.1.1.11? and can 2.2.2.1 be advertised
as source ip in arp
requests from eth0?

I believe "arp race" may cause purges in a switched network. It certainly
is counter to maintaining
strict interface identity.
