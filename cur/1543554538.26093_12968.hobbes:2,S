Note for future reference: please report configuration and build bugs
to linux-kbuild@torque.net.  Speaking for myself, I am much more likely
to notice it there, as the volume is a lot lower than l-k. (:

I cannot reproduce this.  Yes, the CONFIG_MD_BOOT option is still
selected while invisible from the menu, but after exiting menuconfig it
does not appear in the .config file.
Can you send me the buggy .config that Menuconfig generated?
