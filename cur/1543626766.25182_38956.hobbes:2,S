fh_lock()/fh_unlock().  Hell, it does call notify_change() with ATTR_SIZE,
so unless i_sem was taken by caller we would be in big trouble, wouldn't
we?  Old rules were "if you call it to truncate a file, grab i_sem".

<looking> oh, crap.
OK, here's the story:
	* HPFS can run out of space trying to remove entry from directory.
Joys of badly implemented B-Trees.  So as a last-ditch we try to truncate
victim in hope that it will give us some space.  _If_ there is nobody else
who'd have access to it.  Thus the truncate() attempt.
	* my flame re grep(1) applies to myself - first deadlock in there
had been created by new locking rules patch (in fs/namei.c).
	* Dave's patch had added one more level of the same.  Happy, happy,
joy, joy...
	Looking at that stuff, I'd suggest to
a) kill that branch in hpfs_unlink().
b) remove fh_lock()/fh_unlock() in nfsd/vfs.c::nfsd_setattr() (Trond?)
c) add ATTR_SXID that would do s[ug]id removal - under ->i_sem and switch
   the callers to it.
Comments?  If you don't see any problems with this variant I'll do it.
