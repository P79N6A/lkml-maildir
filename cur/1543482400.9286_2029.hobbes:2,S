Your TB Tropez card isn't configured the way your /etc/conf.modules
claims. The driver tried to get it to reset and then generate an
interrupt, and the interrupt occured on IRQ 15, not 9 as you specified
in /etc/conf.modules. I'm assuming here that you used modprobe rather
than insmod.
Are you using isapnp to configure the card, or just relying on the
driver ?
