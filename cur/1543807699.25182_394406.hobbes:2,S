Jens,
Is there a document that clearly lists how these components (SCSI, 
SG_IO, ATA/PI etc et al) connect together and what protocol / transports 
they use? I suspect the problem with all these current arguments is that 
very few people understand how this all works / connects. I think alot 
of people equate kconfig options with how the stuff works under the hood 
(even though a number of these config options are badly named to say the 
least).
