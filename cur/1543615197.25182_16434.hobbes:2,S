Well, you may discuss it again, but this time after actually reading
the C standard:
    "6.3.6 Additive operators
      ...  
     9 Unless both the pointer operand and the result point to
       elements of the same array object, or the pointer operand
       points one past the last element of an array object and the
       result points to an element of the same array object, the
       behavior is undefined if the result is used as an operand of a
       unary * operator that is actually evaluated."

Why gcc shouldn't be making some optimization. Because a particular
person doesn't like it or ?  What kind of statement is that anyway ?

It is not a workaround, it is a fix to an invalid code, which gets
triggered by particular optimization.

Although all uses of the RELOC macro violate the standard, this kind
of pointer arithmetic is far too common and usually produces the
expected behavior, thus it make sense to optimize the cases where ut
breaks

*mutters something about head and sand* ;)
