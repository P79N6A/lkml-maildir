OK, so the derivation right side should change a little (I'll take a patch).
The actual point is one of design philosophy.  Instead of presenting the 
ser with unnecessarily platform-specific questions, we should be asking
platform-independent (wherever this is possible) questions about the 
*capabilities* he/she wants and mixing that wuith information about the
platform.
I'll go further than that.  PP_RTC should probably never have existed
as a user-visible symbol and question in the first place, as it
duplicates what PPC is asking.  The derivation should actually take
place somewhere in the C code of the PPC port tree.
