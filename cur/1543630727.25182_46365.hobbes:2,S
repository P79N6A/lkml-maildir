I wonder if this (or another known patch) fixes an SiS900 problem I've been 
experiencing on 2.4.18.  When you unplug and plug back in the cat 5 cable 
(forcing it to redetect the link), it starts dropping packets like mad until 
the next reboot.  Ping shows this up nicely...
I reported this problem a week or two back...

...but haven't really followed up yet.  (It's a "don't do that then" at the 
moment.)  I should probably go ask Donald Becker.  (I should also try 
compiling as a module and doing insmod/rmmod and see if that fixes it, but 
that's not really a fix, it's another workaround...)
