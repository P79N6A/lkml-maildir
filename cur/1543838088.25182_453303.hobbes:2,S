Just a quick intro to what is pending in kbuild.git/lxdialog.git for 2.6.19.
And a short status too.
Highlights:
	o unifdef is now included in the kernel source (used by
	  headers_* targets).
	o lxdialog is now built-in (this did not remove all flickering
	  but thats much easier to fix now).
	o Added color theme support to lxdialog (see help in menuconfig)
	o modpost is run twice on vmlinux in normal (modules included)
	  builds - which may result in duplicated warnings.
	  It is run twice to make sure we run modpost in non-modules
	  build. modpost does the section mismatch chcks in all cases
	o try the new "make V=2" thing. It tells why a target got
	  rebuild. It is good to catch those "why the heck did kbuild
	  rebuild that much after changing just a tine CONFIG_ option".
All of this is in latest -mm, and git trees at kernel.org.
Outstanding kbuild issues (I should fix a few of these for 2.6.18):
o make -j N is not as parallel as expected (latest report from Keith
  Ownens but others has complained as well). I assume it is a kbuild
  thing but has no clue how to fix it or debug it further.
o symlinked output directory is no good (Andi Kleen)
o dependency errors in scripts/ (Olaf Hering)
o fix -Wshadow in scripts/ (Jesper Juhl)
  I add quite a few warnings in lxdialog patch serie :-(
o Add a few more color themses from Jan Engelhardt
o bugzilla has a few more issues that needs some love & care
