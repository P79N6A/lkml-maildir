compat_sys_times() has bogus return until jiffies is >= 0.  I discovered
this running LTP within 5 minutes of booting.
The return result
	return compat_jiffies_to_clock_t(jiffies);
will return '-1' to user space and set the negated clock_t value to errno.
I'm not sure what the correct fix for this is.  I can come up with a patch
if anyone has ideas on how to fix it.
At minimum, perhaps it should return a sane errno value.
Thanks,
David Brown
