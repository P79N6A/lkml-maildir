We are working on this. 
There are some Dib0700 boards that have a newer frontend (DIB7000M).
Unfortunately, the frontend driver were not finished yet and will go
only to 2.6.20.
However, there are several already supported DIB0700 that don't require
the newer frontend and should go to 2.6.19. So, it is just a matter of
fixing Kconfig, removing the (still) unused symbol.
I'll send you the fix until tomorrow, after having an ack from Patrick
(the author of DIB drivers).
