Hello,
on this vaio sz72b I can't suspend if usb-storage is loaded. Bisecting
is becoming troublesome as different sets have slightly different
problems.
At one point (with the GREGKH usb stuff built) I had the kernel
reporting it cannot stop the usb-storage thread so I guess that
something later in the series made things worse (freezable workqueues?).
Clues?
