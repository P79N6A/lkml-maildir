Alan or Andrew,
Would it be appropriate for me to send in a patch that disabled
CONFIG_SERIAL_JSM in *-mm/arch/ppc64/defconfig for the time being?
As Alan has explained, his flip buffer removal killed serial jsm
(it was already in ill health.)
I trip over it when I try to cross compile all the defconfig's.
My inclination is that it better to make an effort to keep *-mm
compiling for all defconfigs.
