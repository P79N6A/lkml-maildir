First, queue cookies for all existing processes.
Then, as process data changes, queue cookies for
processes that need to be examined again. Suppress
queueing of cookies for processes that are already
in the queue so things don't get too backed up.
If memory usage exceeds some adjustable limit, then
switch to supplying all processes until the backlog
is gone.
I realize that the implementation may prove difficult.

Either that's marketing, or I missed something. :-)
Can I force specific data sizes? Can I force a string to
be NUL-terminated or a NUL-padded fixed-length buffer?
Can I request padding bytes to be skipped over?
