I did create the root node (b4/0). Just used cat for testing, since I
didn't have dd available yet on the initrd. But obviously it did not
work.. :-\

Ah, excellent: A IDE controller is found:
CS5530: IDE controller at PCI slot 0000:00:12.2
The according line in lspci:
00:12.2 0101: 1078:0102
And there are also two IDE interfaces:
PCI: Setting latency timer iof devvice 0000:00:12.0 to 64
      ide0: BM-DMA at 0xfb00-0xfb07, BIOS settings: hda: pio, hdb: pio
      ide1: BM-DMA at 0xfb08-0xfb0f, BIOS settings: hdc: pio, hdd: pio
Probing IDE interface ide0...
Probing IDE interface ide1...
..but no devices, which is logical: If there would be devices, I could use
them via /dev/hd*.
But why is the IDE controller being recognized, while no devices are
found..?

'No such device or address'.. I already tried special devices before,
forgot to mention.
Maybe I just gonna try to get some more information about my hardware and
recheck my Kernel configuration..
