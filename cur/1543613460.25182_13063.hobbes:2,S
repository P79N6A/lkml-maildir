Ok, rc1-aa1 is installed, up and running. Since it took a little more
then a day last time for this behavour to be displayed, i'll have to
wait before i can report back anything usefull.
Ps, a side question. if this is 'inode' and 'dentry' cache, why isnt it
reported as 'used by cache' in free, top, gtop, etc?
Also, why is this such a progressive problem? Even if i do a find on the
full +/- 400 gigs, create and remove 2 gig files, create 1000 temp
files, etc, in the first day the memory isnt 'disapearing' yet.
(ofcource it uses a lot of mem for cache/buffers, but no 'unaccounted
for in free or top' memory.
Will report back soon,
