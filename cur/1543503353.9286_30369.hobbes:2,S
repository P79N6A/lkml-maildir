Not much --- simply the observation that clustered readaround appears to
be faster than strict readahead for binary paging.

For binaries, you can turn it around the other way --- it is no truer to
assert that significant readahead is better than readbehind, once you
are doing enough readahead to read in the majority of functions in one
go.  When code jumps between functions, it ends up doing so backwards
about as much as forwards, in the absense of explicit optimisations.
Therefore, the current code doesn't care whether the readaround is
backwards or forwards: rather, it is optimised for a different goal,
which is to minimise the total number of IOs necessary to completely
page in a section of a file.  With clustered IOs, nearby page faults
will result in the caching of an entire contiguous chunk of the file
with no gaps.

A very good question.  Does anyone want to try this?

The clustered mechanism is definitely used by some other OSes for
paging.  That, and strict readahead, seem the two best basic mechanisms
to try, but the principle of triggering the next cluster readahead in
advance of actually using it, for sequentially accessed memory maps, is
still a valid extension to the existing simple clustering.
