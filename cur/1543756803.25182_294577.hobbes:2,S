Sorry to jump late in the thread - apologies in advance if
 this info has already been provided...
On my Dell C640, onboard sound has been working forever,
 but it's a while since I have it in-kernel:
[root@incident root]# dmesg | grep -i intel8
intel8x0_measure_ac97_clock: measured 49438 usecs
intel8x0: clocking to 48000
[root@incident root]# grep -i 8X0 /usr/src/linux/.config
CONFIG_SND_INTEL8X0=y
CONFIG_SND_INTEL8X0M=m
[root@incident root]# uname -a
Linux incident 2.6.11-rc3-bk7 #1 Fri Feb 11 10:12:09 CET 2005 i686
