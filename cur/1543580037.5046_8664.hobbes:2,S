fixes have been incorporated for a number of different release trains for 
the pix.
Fixed-In Version now covers releases:
         5.1(2.206), 5.1(2.207), 5.2(1.200), 6.0(0.100), 5.2(3.210)
cheers,
lincoln.
NB. it has been posted that Raptor filewalls will also apparently fail to 
allow connections with ECN bits set.
