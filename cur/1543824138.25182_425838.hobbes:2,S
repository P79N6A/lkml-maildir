Subject: edac driver names in sysfs.

EDAC does something funky that no other afaik seems to do.
#define edac_xstr(s) edac_str(s)
#define edac_str(s) #s
#define EDAC_MOD_STR edac_xstr(KBUILD_BASENAME)
And then..
	.name = EDAC_MOD_STR,
in its pci_driver structs.
This leads to it looking a bit 'odd' in /sys/bus/pci/drivers
compared to the others.
/sys/bus/pci/drivers/\"e752x_edac\"/
Is correcting this to remove the quotes likely to break anything
in userspace ?
