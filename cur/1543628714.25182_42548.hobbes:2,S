(gdb) run
Starting program: /usr/local/games/angband-2.9.7-alpha1/./angband
warning: Cannot insert breakpoint -2:
Cannot access memory at address 0xcc1088a823d9d62c
(gdb) q
The program is running.  Exit anyway? (y or n) y
ALPHA :
the breakpoint with a negative number, followed by the message 'Cannot
access memory at ...' happens on any executable I try with gdb.
This didn't happen with the 2.4.x kernels, so I suspect something in
2.5.x. Any ideas?
Thanks,
Jurriaan
