  It looks like the problem was that "CONFIG_IP_NF_NAT=m".  I changed
this to 'y' and things look to be compiling fine now.
  I do now note that despite using 'make oldconfig' on my 2.6.15 .config
file I had to reselect a load of Netfilter options, and it would seem I
decided this time around to have 'm' instead of 'y' there (this is for
my desktop machine where I'll only really use NAT if experimenting
before making changes to the router/firewall machine).
  Basically it's a failure with 'make oldconfig' in some way, but if we
can select 'm' for CONFIG_IP_NF_NAT then surely it should work.
