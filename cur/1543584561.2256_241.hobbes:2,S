I am using kernel-2.4.2-ac12 (will try ac14). The motherboard is a
Supermicro P6DBU. (I will need to check the board when I get home to
confirm). I get the messages below when the system starts:
acpi: system description tables not found
The manufacturer says that there is support for acpi. So I willing to beat
it around a bit to get the tables found. Any ideas where to start?
