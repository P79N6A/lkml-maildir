The problem: some keyboards have MORE than 14 extra keys - for example, HP OEM
keyboards on Pavilion series have 22!
Which is why I made a driver (2.2.x only for now) which allows one to exploit
them all with the help of a user space daemon. Submitted to Jeff Garzik for
proofreading, I'll submit it to lkml when he's done with it. I don't expect it
to be integrated though, given the overall utility of it ;)

This I've done too, but it's a skeleton for now.
