today since one of my mirrored harddisk (/dev/hda) failed, I removed it from
md-raid1 and now /dev/hdc becomes /dev/hda
hdparm -t /dev/hda gets me ~37MB/s now (before: /dev/hda - 30MB/s,
/dev/hdc - 37MB/s)
maybe there's problem with /dev/hda so it's relatively slower!
However, the result still much slower than kernel 2.4.20 (55MB/s)
