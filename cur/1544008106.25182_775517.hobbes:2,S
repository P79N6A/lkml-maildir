This strikes me as overkill.  What we really want to do is to protect
against concurrent access to f_flags - something which could come about
in a couple of other situations (nfsd/vfs.c tweaks it, for example).
We *could* just extend files_lock to cover f_flags too, but that comes
at the cost of making ->fasync() atomic when it never has been before -
doesn't seem like a good idea.
Perhaps we just need a single f_flags_mutex?  For code changing
f_flags only (it woudn't be needed to query the flags)? Then
ioctl_fionbio() and ioctl_fioasync() could use it too. It's hard to
imagine that there's enough contention to warrant any more than that,
especially given that it all (except ioctl_fionbio()) has been under
the BKL until now.
