So... what's the story on this versus lttng?
Is there some userspace code available for people to test this?  Maybe it's
mentioned and I missed it.
It'd be interesting to see a writeup of the proposed kernel<->userspace
interfaces.  I see a description of kernel-internal interfaces, but how do
users use it?
I see it uses things from blktrace.  Can blktrace be switched over to being
a client of this code?
