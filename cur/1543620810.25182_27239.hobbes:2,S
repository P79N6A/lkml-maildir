Which board rev are you using ?
I have 1.03. No problem with PCI so far. All cards that I tried worked just 
fine.

Same for me.

I replaced that ASUS USB 2.0 card with Adaptec Duo Connect (USB 2.0 / 1394).
Works just fine.

Yeah. You should use another one under JEN jumper.

True. It should be Jumperless + DIP SW off/off/off/off.

I use EnerMax 430W. IBM 40GB + WD 10GB + HITACHI DVD + IOMEGA CDRW.
Works perfectly (with the patch from Linux-IDE folks, otherwise DMA doesn't 
work).

I have minitower in-win case (with the case fan). And I'm very happy with it.
CPU and chipset temperatures are  just fine (41C - 51C).

I was pretty happy with packaging.
And yes it's super fast and reliable.
