You look at the dentry.  Yes, you have to traverse the filesystem.  There are 
a number of things that care about traversing the filesystem, including 
scheduled backups, updatedb, and potentially this thing.  I realise that you 
believe nobody should ever do this.  I don't care.

Google for it.

Most of this infrastructure is there already.  Documentation/dnotify.txt.

Were you here for the discussion of I/O completion ports as a potential 
solution to the "thundering herd" problem a few years ago?  Haven't checked 
to see how similar epoll is, I haven't had a scalability bottleneck in that 
area recently...

You don't WANT it to.  You want to batch up the work so that if a file changes 
every thirty seconds you're not constantly being woken up to deal with it 
again!

If you need to look at the contents of the disk (to check for the runs of null 
bytes), then you need to look at the contents of the disk.  Once you've 
identified data you need to load in, if you don't want to push everything 
else out of cache, you should be able to give some kind of hint that it 
shouldn't keep this data around.  The new ionice work is at least a step in 
this direction, although it doesn't address this particular problem, and I 
believe the dentry cache is a different beast than the page cache...

I'm not talking about updatedb.
