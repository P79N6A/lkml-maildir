Of course, people other than myself can and do run cross-builds on -mm
trees, which is doubleplus efficient.  It appears that Adrian is doing
this, for one.
So the 100-or-more people write their patches, they go into -mm and then I
and a few others do the cross-compiling, feed back or fix any problems.
