Subject: [PATCH 1/9]: introduce radix_tree_gang_lookup_range
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/11/21/276

Introduce radix_tree_gang_lookup_range()
The inode clustering in XFS requires a gang lookup on the radix tree to
find all the inodes in the cluster.  The gang lookup has to set the
maximum items to that of a fully populated cluster so we get all the
inodes in the cluster, but we only populate the radix tree sparsely (on
demand).
As a result, the gang lookup can search way, way past the index of end
of the cluster because it is looking for a fixed number of entries to
return.
We know we want to terminate the search at either a specific index or a
maximum number of items, so we need to add a "last_index" parameter to
the lookup.
Furthermore, the existing radix_tree_gang_lookup() can use this same
function if we define a RADIX_TREE_MAX_INDEX value so the search is not
limited by the last_index.
