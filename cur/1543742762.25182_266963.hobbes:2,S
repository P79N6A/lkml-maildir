It should work in 2.4 providing you use the loading options for
ncr53c400a and set a port and no IRQ (read mine did). What options are

The 53c400a can be programming to an address by software - either by
magic sequences or I believe according to pin strapping by ISAPnP.
Its been a long time since I touched such junk however and if you want
