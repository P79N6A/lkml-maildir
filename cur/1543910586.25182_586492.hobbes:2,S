The cache miss is going to cost you half the memory bandwidth of a full 
copy. If the data is already in cache, then the copy is cheaper.
However, removing the copy removes the kernel from the picture on the 
receive side, so you lose demultiplexing, asynchronism, security, 
accounting, flow-control, swapping, etc. If it's ok with you to not use 
the kernel stack, then why expect to fit in the existing infrastructure 
anyway ?

What do you need from the kernel for RDMA support beyond HW drivers ? A 
fast way to pin and translate user memory (ie registration). That is 
pretty much the sandbox that David referred to.
Eventually, it would be useful to be able to track the VM space to 
implement a registration cache instead of using ugly hacks in user-space 
to hijack malloc, but this is completely independent from the net stack.

The port spaces are either totally separate and there is no issue, or 
completely identical and you should then run your connection manager in 
user-space or fix your middlewares.

I don't think it's fair. This thread actually show how pushy some RDMA 
folks are about not acknowledging that the current infrastructure is 
here for a reason, and about mistaking zero-copy and RDMA.
This is a similar argument than the TOE discussion, and it was 
definitively a good decision to not mess up the Linux stack with TOEs.
