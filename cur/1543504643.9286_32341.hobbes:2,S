*nods* It's - probably - a useful feature / technology, but I can't find any
info on it (but I'm probably looking in the wrong place). I *do* have a
utility called simply 'smart', with no author information; I think I culled
it from this list a while back. I've put it on
http://www.loth.demon.co.uk/smart.c
 (it's 4422 bytes). Unfortunately I don't
completely understand the output. I also don't know what the drive behaviour
is when it detects it's failing -- some of the output suggests it may auto-
offline itself, but I don't know if you have to enable any options on the
drive for that to happen. It would also be nice if there was some way the
IDE drivers could detect this (maybe they do).
