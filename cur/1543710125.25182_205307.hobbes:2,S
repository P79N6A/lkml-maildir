The problem is that if (say) you use 100 character lines, then someone
reading it in an 80-column window sees 80-char line, 20-char line, etc
etc and it's very annoying to read.  If you make every paragraph one
huge line, then when someone wants to quote your message, they have to
wrap the quote themselves.
Keeping email lines to about 70 characters is still the best policy.
