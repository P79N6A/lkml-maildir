I thought so too, until I looked at the IB driver :(
The issue is, if pci_enable_msix() fails, we want to fall back to MSI,
so you need to call pci_enable_msi() for that (after calling
pci_disable_msi() before calling pci_enable_msix(), what a mess...)
So we still need both functions, and for MSI-X, the logic involved in
enabling it is horrible.  Let me see if this can be made saner...
thanks,
