Hi Horst.

 1. Start with /etc/passwd which determines ownership of the actual
    user accounts not just on Linux but on every UNIX compatible
    operating system I've seen. Add /etc/group and /etc/shadow (if
    applicable) to that.
 2. Have a look at /etc/securetty which determines the ownership of
    terminals that the superuser can log into.
 3. Have a look at /etc/hosts.{allow,deny,equiv} which determine
    which hosts have permission to access your system.
That's without applying any thought to the matter...
Best wishes from Riley.
