What do you mean by _the_ recommended compiler? Is 2.7.2.3 recommended no
more? Is there some benefit using egcs-1.1.2 instead of 2.7.2.3?
Should Changes be changed?
2.2.18pre15:
Version 1.1.2 seems okay; if you have to have a binary, you may be
successful using that.  In general, however, gcc-2.7.2.3 is known to be
stable, while egcs and others have not been as thoroughly tested yet.
