     There is a denial-of-service program called "octopus", and a variant
called "spider" (not to be confused with a web spider), whose sole purpose is
to consume all of the resources, usually file descriptors, of a target machine. 
     This patch would be a useful in preventing such a program from being
effective; it would also be useful on IRC servers for limiting clone bots. 
     In a word, YES, it would be very useful functionality.
