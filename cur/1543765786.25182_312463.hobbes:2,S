 This thread started as an private inquiry to James regarding the status
of four patchsets I posted about a week ago.  I'm replying publicly as I
think we can use some discussion.  The four patchsets are... (in the
following order)
 * timer updates
 * REQ_SPECIAL/REQ_SOFTBARRIER usage change
 * scsi_request_fn reimpl
 * requeue path consolidation.
 Accepted patches are
 * scsi_cmnd->internal_timeout kill
 * scsi_cmnd->serial_number_at_timeout
 * remove volatile
 * scsi_send_eh_cmnd() clean up
 All four accepted patches are not included in any of above patchsets
and the timer update patchset doesn't depend on
REQ_SPECIAL/REQ_SOFTBARRIER usage change patchset, so please review the
timer update patchset.
 And, James, regarding REQ_SOFTBARRIER, if the REQ_SOFTBARRIER thing can
be removed from SCSI midlayer, do you agree to change REQ_SPECIAL to
mean special requests?  If so, I have three proposals.
 * move REQ_SOFTBARRIER setting to right after the allocation of
scsi_cmnd in scsi_prep_fn().  This will be the only place where
REQ_SOFTBARRIER is used in SCSI midlayer, making it less pervasive.
 * Or, make another API which sets REQ_SOFTBARRIER on requeue.  maybe
blk_requeue_ordered_request()?
 * Or, make blk_insert_request() not set REQ_SPECIAL on requeue.  IMHO,
this is a bit too subtle.
 I like #1 or #2.  Jens, what do you think?  Do you agree to remove
requeue feature from blk_insert_request()?
 Thanks a lot. :-)
