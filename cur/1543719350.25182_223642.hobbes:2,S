Hi, you're adding new interfaces for power management of LCD and 
backlight devices.  Since there's already LDM/sysfs interfaces for 
reading and writing power state of generic devices, is it necessary to 
add ones particular to these devices or device classes?  In other words, 
is /sys/devices/<bus>/<device>/power/state not suitable for these purposes?
And if a PM interface for device classes is needed that ties into the 
device driver suspend/resume callbacks, perhaps it can be modeled more 
closely on the existing interfaces?  These new interfaces seem to be 
intended to define: 0 == power off, 1 ==  power on.  The existing 
ACPI-inspired interfaces use: 0 == power on/full-power, 1/2/3/4 == 
low-power/off state.
New files don't have GPL license comments.
