At least on A7M266-D lmsensors read thermal sensors very wrong. I
haven't got time to contact devs with that, but I do know for sure that
amd76x_pm really does make cooling calls, even in 2.6.5-rc3-mm3
(There should be /sys/devices/pci0000\:00/0000\:00\:00.0/C2_cnt file,
which tells how many times has amd76x_pm really made the disconnection call).
One issue is that from some kernel version amd76x_pm's idle() is called
upto 3.5x times more often when there's some audio activity. So in
effect number of calls to default_idle() jumps from 1100Hz to 3800Hz.
(this is reproducible with 'rhytmbox' -application, but not with xmms.
AFAIK my xmms uses OSS emulation and rhytmbox is native alsa.)
Ahem. Could you actually try:
echo 3 > /sys/devices/pci0000\:00/0000\:00\:00.0/lazy_idle
This could help gaining 5-8°C. HZ changed from 100 to 1000 in 2.6, so
amd76x_pm old default doesn't apply overly well here. 
There's some funniness going on with this tunable. It doesn't really
affect how many times/second we call amd76x_pm.idle(), but rather how
easily we go into sleep (no sleep if both CPU's aren't idle).
With lazy_idle at 3 I get bad distortions with bttv card. with 3000 they
disappear, but so does the thermal throttling :)
(Sorry for lack of coherence right now)
