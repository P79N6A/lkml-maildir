Eventually you will realize how much those bloated lock resource names cost
in CPU and change them to a binary encoding.

Twould be a shame to invest a lot of effort hashing those horrible strings
before finally realizing the strings themselves should be gotten rid of, and
have to optimize the hash all over again.
Since the hash table won't fit in cache except on the beefiest of machines,
the right hash chain length to aim for is one.  That requires both good a
hash function and big hash table.  A sane resource encoding would also help.
Chestnut for the day: don't get too obsessed about optimizing for the light
load case.  A cluster filesystem is supposed to be a beast of burden.  It
needs big feet.
