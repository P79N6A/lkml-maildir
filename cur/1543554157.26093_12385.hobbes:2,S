	Linux kernel versions are now running up to 2.4.0*, what is
	that 6.1 ?  Some distribution ?  Which ?
	Which kernel version you are referring into ?

	With mutexes, waitqueues, or spinlocks.
	All kernel facilities.

	Really ?  Who says you need to   lock_kernel()  for starting
	a kernel thread ?

	Pick 2.4.0 sources, open them up.
	Then do:  "make psdocs" or "make pdfdocs" or "make htmldocs"
	and you get up documents from within the system into your
	source location Documentation/DocBook/  subdirectory.
	You propably want to study  kernel-hacking,  kernel-locking,
	and  kernel-api   documents.
	(Your system needs to have DocBook, related SGML tools, and
	 (for PS/PDF) (La)TeX subsystem.)
