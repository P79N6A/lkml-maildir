   This is a follow-up from the previous RFC for the bridge-nf patch.
   The new patch adds one member to the skbuff, a pointer to a struct 
   nf_bridge_info. There is still a need to change ip_output.c, but the change 
   is the analogue as is done for the skbuff->nfct pointer field. So, for me 
   this is a clean solution. The copy of the Ethernet header is no longer done 
   in ip_fragment().
This definitely looks a lot better.
I still want the netfilter team to 'ACK' the core/ipv4 netfilter
changes before I apply this. :-)
