I just want to let you know that there hasn't been any problem until now
using 2.6.10-ac2.  Though I didn't see changes in the dm-snapshot code,
there are quite a lot in dm-crypt.  This seems to be the key: my
problems always appeared with a crypted device mounted.  But I didn't
realize this dependency until now...
Thanks again,
