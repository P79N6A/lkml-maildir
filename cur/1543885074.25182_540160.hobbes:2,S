That wasn't paravirt detection that was do I have permissions to load
the gdt.
Basically we have two choices.   Either unconditionally demand
that %cs %ds %es and %ss are loaded, and so we remove all descriptor
loading.
Or we can do:
startup_32:
	movl	%cs, %eax
	testl	$3, %eax
        jnz     1f
	movl $(__BOOT_DS),%eax
	movl %eax,%ds
	movl %eax,%es
	movl %eax,%fs
	movl %eax,%gs
	movl %eax,%ss
1:
Which only demands that the segments be loaded when we aren't in ring0.
At least historically that is safe for the linux kernel but really weird.
Since there is only one fringe bootloader that cares I'm thinking just
removing all segment loading and assume we have the equivalent of
BOOT_DS in the segments probably makes the most sense.
I'm thinking that our next protocol version probably needs to be 3.0
given the significance of the change, and the fact we are breaking
in a very small ways backwards compatibility.

I think it is much better to test the boot_params.platform field where
we care.  If the platform is a native x86 subarch we don't need
a magic startup function.  If the platform is Xen or lguest
we can at best copy our boot parameters and jump to their custom
startup routines.
