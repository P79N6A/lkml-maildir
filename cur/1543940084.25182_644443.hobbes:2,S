You have to use 15 (or 16? I forget) on T61, X61, R61, X60(I think)... for
maximum brightness :-p   And the interface to get maximum brightness has
always been to cat max_brightness > brightness, AFAIK.

Well, I can tell you why it is empty on the thinkpad-acpi side.  It defaults
to brightness_enable=0 on Lenovo 16-brightness level boxes, where the right
thing to do is to control brightness using the X.org drivers or through the
ACPI brightness driver.
But I have no idea why it is empty re. the ACPI video driver.

I am reading this ML with eyes fully open.  When a sensible (read: any)
consensus is found, I will follow it.
