Subject: PCMCIA problem: writing to Intel Flash Series 2+

Summary:
I can read, but not write to or erase, an Intel Series 2+ flash card.
In the event of a reply, please Cc to my email address, as I am no
subscribed.
Hardware:
Toshiba Tecra 8100 laptop
Intel Series 2+ flash memory card
Software:
Linux 2.4.17
pcmcia-cs-3.1.33
Detail:
When I insert the flash card, the card is correctly recognised and the
appropriate modules load.  If I do a "cat /dev/mem0c0c" I get a load of
gibberish on the console, which I assume indicates that I am reading
from the card.
If I attempt to format the card, I get the following error:
	$ ftl_format /dev/mem0c0c
	Partition size = 8 mb, erase size = 128 kb, 1 transfer units
	Reserved 5%, formatted size = 7755264 bytes
	Erasing all blocks...
	block erase failed: input/output error
	format failed.
Querying the card, I get:
	$ ftl_check /dev/mem0c0c
	Memory region info:
	  Card offset = 0x0, region size = 8 mb, access speed = 150 ns
	  Erase block size = 128 kb, partition multiple = 128 kb
	No valid erase unit headers!
The following gets reported to the log:
	kernel: iflash2+_mtd: erase timed out!
	kernel: CSR = 0x0000, BSR = 0x4040, GSR = 0x0606
Is there any other info that would be useful?
Thanks in advance...
josh.
