Hi,
I am having the bug
FATAL: Error inserting capi ([..]/capi.ko): Device or resource busy
when I try to reload capi after loading it.
in dmesg: capi20: unable to get major 68
I attached a patch to fix the issue which is caused by setting the major to
zero when registering the chrdev succeeded. Please apply
- - Stefan
errors in the dmesg:
CAPI Subsystem Rev 1.1.2.8
capifs: Rev 1.1.2.3
capi20: Rev 1.1.2.7: started up with major 0 (middleware+capifs)
<-- here you see that it was set to 0.
(after unload and retry)
