Okay. Wild guess: you're using 32 bit CardBus (yenta socket?), but hx4700
is using 16 bit PCMCIA (drivers/pcmcia/ds.c). And indeed ds.c calling
device_unregister() which triggers that sequece:
ide_cs.c:ide_detach()
ide_cs.c:ide_release()
ide.c:ide_unregister() <- hang here
I've grep'ed drivers/pcmcia/ for the device_unregister and seems nobody
calling it except drivers/pcmcia/ds.c.

p.s. drivers/pcmcia/cardbus.c states:
 * cardbus.c -- 16-bit PCMCIA core support
typo?
