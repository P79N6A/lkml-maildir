Martin has started a major rewrite/cleanup of this driver
recently that I believe he wanted to send in one of his next
updates for 2.5.7x. Your patch looks good, but it is probably
duplicated work. Do you have a tested backport for 2.4.2x? If
so, we could merge it for the z990 code drop.
Martin, is the new driver in a state that you can send Pete
for reference?
