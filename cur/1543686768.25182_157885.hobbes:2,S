I have a patch that creates helper functions that make that simple. The 
patch is stuck right now, because it exposes a bug in the i386 debug 
register handling. I'll add it redzoning with MUST_HWCACHE_ALIGN after 
that one is in.

I don't care about performance with slab debugging on. kmalloc(4096,) 
usually takes ~40 cpu ticks on i386. With debugging on, it includes a 
memset and an open coded memcmp - my guess is a few thousand cpu ticks, 
and that's intentional. Do not enable it on production systems.

Hmm. That means slab debugging did it's job: The driver contains the 
wrong assumption that all pointers are cache line aligned. Without slab 
debugging, this would result in rare data corruptions in O_DIRECT apps. 
With slab debugging on, it's exposed immediately.
