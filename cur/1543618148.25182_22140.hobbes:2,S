Volcanomark is a Java(TM) chatroom benchmark: multiple rooms, where for each
room, every input from a client generates a write to every other client
(think broadcast storm).
chat (which is a C version of Volcanomark) is useful for testing, as is
hackbench2 (which is cut down to just exhibit the runqueue problem, and
doesn't even use threads).
Hope that helps,
Rusty.
