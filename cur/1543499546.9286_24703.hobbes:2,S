i think that's artificial -- in real-world situations, we don't
have that kind of control over the hash, and it would "dishonest" to
suggest that this number meant something specific.

agreed.

also agreed.

do you have both SCSI and IDE disks of varying sizes?  any benchmarks
besides du, like bonnie, or timing a kernel build?
your tests suggest fixing the shift value at 6, instead of using hashbits,
for varying hash table sizes and block sizes?
have you examined the goodness of the page cache hash function?
questions, questions...
