Can they sue me even if I'm not living in US? Is marking code "this
stuff might be illegal in US and Japan" enough to avoid lawsuits?
What exactly is illegal: _writing_ infringing code, or _using_
infringing code?
Looking up patents relevant to v.34 implementation would be very
usefull...

That's ugly. Ok
