IMO umount / is bogus. For 2.5 we have much better way to unmount
everything - as soon as rootfs patch goes in, we will be able to
unmount root for real and just fall back to absolute root. Besides,
we can simply pass MNT_DETACH to umount(2) and wait until everything
goes quiet (see namespace-patch). That has a nice side effect - if
some fs is really busy (hung NFS hard mount, leak somewhere, whatever)
it will not hold the filesystem it's mounted on. Or prevent clean
unmount of filesystems mounted under it, for that matter, even if
we would hang trying to look their mountpoints up. Whether it goes
into the distributions' shutdown sequences or not, I'm quite happy
using it when I do fs stuff - I'm sick and tired of forced fsck on
root just because experimental stuff mounted on /mnt decides to
hang...
