Very true. But is a kernel thread like kswapd depends on a userspace 
program, then that program better be well behaved.

If the NFS server needed kswapd, we'd deadlock pretty soon, as kswapd 
*really* needs the NFS server. In our case, all block I/O is done using 
unbuffered I/O, and all memory is preallocated, so we don't need kswapd 
at all, just that small bit of memory that syscalls consume.
If the NFS server really needs kswapd, then there'd better be two of 
them. Regular processes would depend on one kswapd, which depends on the 
NFS server, which depends on the second kswapd, which depends on the 
hardware alone. It should be fun trying to describe that topology to the 
kernel through some API.
Our filesystem actually does something like that internally, except the 
dependency chain length is seven, not two.
