Greg asked that too and I skipped his question because I needed an
explanation. So here it is now.
I thought that the match list for USB core and the shadow list that
usb-storage had were separate. So, libusual receives the first but
not the second, which remains in usb-storage. Once they are split
like that, I thought it unsafe to continue to use an index to
correlate them, so I added extra fields into the list of information
specific list to usb-storage, for matching. These fields use more
memory, so I thought it would cost nothing to move flags over
into driver_info. The resultant savings make usb-storage somewhat
shorter than it was before. It is shorter even when libusual is
configured off. This is because the second list is about twice
shorter now.
I can drop that part of the patch, I just thought it would be safer.
If you prefer that, I would suggest moving "normal" devices at the
bottom of the list into the unusual_devs.h, to make sure that
indexes stay the same. In such case, we won't need dropping commas.
