Big endian:
Given:  unsigned long = 0xdeadface;
           Low memory <---        ---> High memory
It looks in memory, just like you typed it with your editor.
BUT... The high vs. low bits of the individual bytes are not
changed. In other words, 0xde, the high byte, still has 'd'
as the high nibble and 'e' as the low nibble. Therefore the
MSB of a longword, in big endian format, is truly at the lowest
memory location occupied by that longword.

    was handled in the BIOS, I found that there aren't any.
