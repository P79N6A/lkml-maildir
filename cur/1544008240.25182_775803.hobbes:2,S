OK, if this happens again I will try a new cable. However, the backplane
(it is this one:
http://www.raidsonic.de/en/pages/products/backplanes.php?we_objectID=4251
 ) was working nicely with another disk in the same slot (but maybe I did not perfectly insert the disk...)

Yes. This is actually the only difference to the drive before (which was
1.5 Gbps).
For now it is all running nicely and I did a full dd if= ... read of the
disk:
ata3: SATA max UDMA/133 irq_stat 0x00400040, connection status changed irq 510
ata3: SATA link up 3.0 Gbps (SStatus 123 SControl 300)
ata3.00: HPA detected: current 2930277168, native 18446744072344861488
ata3.00: ATA-8: ST31500341AS, CC1G, max UDMA/133
ata3.00: 2930277168 sectors, multi 0: LBA48 NCQ (depth 31/32)
ata3.00: configured for UDMA/133
Thank you very much!!
