Yep ... and it's worth knowing when you're doing
something different.  Different isn't always worse,
isn't always better.

Both of those are "earlier", yes.  Different product developers
may argue for either placement.

Given some product with a Blackfin chip, would you expect a
customer -- who may not even see the Linux bits!! -- to be
able to solve such problems?  If it's not possible for such
problems to crop up in the field, product support (and field
troubleshooting) gets easier...

One or both, yes.  That's typical in embedded setups.
They're not necessarily all that different, but that
code does need to handle the hardware differences.

I thought I referred to different revisions of one platform... :)

Not all platforms work that way though.  There can often be several
options for where a given signal gets routed.
And then there are the errors where someone accidentally copies
something like "GPIO 29" to two places ... invariants like "only
one GPIO requestor at a time" are needed to turn up such stuff.

The $SUBJECT patch uses the string "IRQ" in all cases.
But "smc_irq" and "codec_irq" would be more informative
as entries in a list of even just a handful of GPIOs.
And with a few dozen, I'd find "IRQ" not at all helpful.

The issue is just where those limits lie.  IMO it's not at
all unreasonable to require board-specific code.  External
chips will need board-specfic glue data in most cases (how
they're addressed, what IRQs they use, and so on); and you
may have drivers available that correspond to devices that
are not wired up on that particular hardware.

Sure ... you'd need to say "this board uses <these devices>"
and if integrated in the SOC that's often enough.  External
devices need more configuration.  Even for integrated ones,
that knowledge doesn't belong in the driver ... "which of the
many UARTS to use as console" isn't standard, and neither
is "what hardware handshaking pins are in use".

Just remember that "Aunt Tilly" doesn't configure kernels.
And that even deeply technical people who do configure
them may not have the details fresh in mind a few months
later.  ;)
