There are a number of cases where updates are extremely rare.
FD management and module unloading are but two examples.  In
such cases, the overhead of the IPIs in the extremely rare updates
is overwhelmed by the reduction in overhead in the very common
accesses.
And getting rid of rmb() or rmb_me_harder() makes the read-side
code less complex.
