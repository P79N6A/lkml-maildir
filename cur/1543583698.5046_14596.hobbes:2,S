Well it you give the server an ip alias address that's on the subnet
of the clients, bridge the two segments together,
but use netfilter to drop all packets that aren't your
broadcasts, it might do the trick.  I'm not to familiar with
bridging, but i'm confident that 2.4's netfilter can do it...
you can filter/route based on pretty much *any* data
in the packet, by manually specifying an arbitrary offset
in the headers and bit pattern if necessary IIRC.
if you know which port IP port it's easy.
Can you be more specific... is this an IP broadcast?
or ethernet only like IPX or NetBEUI?
perhaps subnetting with "invalid" netmasks could
cause broadcast to reach entire supernet even
though subnets are on diff segments (in case of IP)
