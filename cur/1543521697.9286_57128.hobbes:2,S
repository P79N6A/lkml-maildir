Yes, you can only get the CDDA sectors through that ioctl.

Even if you could use the regular ll_rw_block infrastructure to
get to the data, you still have a big problem regarding returned
data. CDDA blocks are not a multiple of 512 (they are 2532 bytes)!
The CD-ROM driver itself can quickly be hacked to do this, but 
that would get you nowhere.

What about jitter correction etc? To me an audio ripper is indeed
"obvious user space functionality".

Yes, don't do it. There are other audio-fs variants around,
the only one I have looked at uses the CDROMREADAUDIO ioctl
internally and thus doesn't go though the block layer. Still
bad.
