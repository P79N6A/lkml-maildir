oddly, the close nv driver has like 2.4MB if text in the kernel.  i
suspect a good chunk of this really should be in userspace but
probably lives in the kernel because 'the windows driver does that'
if the in-kernel part was trimmed down it would be nice for nv to move
the resource manager and whatever else lives in their gigantic module
(larger than most kernels!) to userspace and side-step the entire
issue completely

people could make their own.  i'm not sure if anyone has though.
