We've done this (calculated per-task fault rates) here as part of
other memory-management experiments --- I'll clean up the diffs and
send them to the kernel list soon.
One thing that became clear as we did it is that the
setrlimit(RLIMIT_RSS,) call is a no-op.  So we're also trying to fix
that.
Our work is currently against 2.2.14, but the patches shouldn't be too 
hard to put into 2.3.51.
