That, unless you change all the syscalls creating files to accept new 
parameters, would require a syscall+fcntl operation. That is not atomic 
(ie, another thread might do exec between the syscall and the fcntl). 
Again, mine was a general comment, not directed into magically fixing 
existing buggy code. What I meant, was that the vast majority of MT+exec 
apps wants all their fds (but an handfull, maybe) to be O_CLOEXEC. So a 
global, non-inheritable, per-process flag seemed the most straightforward 
solution.
