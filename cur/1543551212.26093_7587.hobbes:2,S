erm, looking at your list it says that you're using Redhat 7.0, which
is known to ship with a buggy gcc, which is KNOWN to do nasty things
with kernels.  
Linux version 2.4.0-test9-JHS1 (root@pcard1fr.ca.nortel.com) (gcc
version 2.96 2
0000731 (Red Hat Linux 7.0)) #2 Thu Oct 5 11:59:31 EDT 2000
yeah, that pretty much sums it up right there.. you may want to try
something else.
