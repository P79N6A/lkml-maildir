with the preemption config set, there is a compile failure with the
ieee1394 drivers.  thank you to Patrick Chase and the others who
reported this.
note: drivers are going to need to explicity include linux/sched.h if
they use (certain) spinlock primitives and want to compile with
CONFIG_PREEMPT set.  its cleaner anyhow.
this patch is against 2.4.9-ac10 but should be fine for 2.4.10-pre5...
