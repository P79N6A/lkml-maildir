I inferred from something Jeff said a while back that the volume management
stuff was storing data in blocks that were marked free in the block bitmap.
From what I know of the on-disk structures, there's 8 bytes of "magic" in the
boot sector, and a filesystem version in one of the system files; I don't
know if either of these are changed by Win2K. Also, I don't know what the
semantics of the filesystem version number are - it's split into major / minor
parts, but what do to changes to either part signify?
