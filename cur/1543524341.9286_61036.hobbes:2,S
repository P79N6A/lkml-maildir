Subject: Problem with vfat in 2.3.(35|39|41)

I apologize if this is a known problem.
At some point in the past, I think with kernel 2.3.39, my vfat-mounted
partition became corrupted when mounted under Linux. It still works in
Windows 98 just fine. If I mount the partition (/dev/hda1) with -t vfat,
I get this behavior:
Dragon:~> ls /win98/
\0016\003.\0036\003  a6\003.c6\003  \2015\003.\2035\003
\3015\003.\3035\003
\0017\003.\0037\003  a6\003.c6\003  \2016\003.\2036\003
\3016\003.\3036\003
\0018\003.\0038\003  a7\003.c7\003  \2017\003.\2037\003
\3017\003.\3037\003
\0019\003.\0039\003  a7\003.c7\003  \2018\003.\2038\003
\3018\003.\3038\003
\t6\003.\v6\003      a8\003.c8\003  \2115\003.\2135\003
\3115\003.\3135\003
\t7\003.\v7\003      a8\003.c8\003  \2116\003.\2136\003
\3116\003.\3136\003
and so on. If I mount it with -t msdos, I get:
Dragon:~> ls /win98/
/bin/ls: /win98/\2015\003.\2035\003: No such file or directory
/bin/ls: /win98/\2115\003.\2135\003: No such file or directory
/bin/ls: /win98/\2215\003.\2235\003: No such file or directory
/bin/ls: /win98/\2315\003.\2335\003: No such file or directory
and so on. This is specific to one system, vfat works on another system of
mine.
Does anyone have any ideas? Is this a known problem? I'm currently running
2.3.41, .config is attached. Please let me know if any other debugging
info would help.
