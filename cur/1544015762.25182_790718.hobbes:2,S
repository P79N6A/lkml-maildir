But that is not what is occurring. We do not do &var + LARGE_OFFSET.
Instead one does
	((void *)&var) + LARGE_OFFSET
or
	((unsigned long)&var) + LARGE_OFFSET
The cast should cause the C compiler to drop all assumptions about size.
And the definition of RELOC_HIDE for icc and generic compilers in the tree
show that this is working.
