	You can use this temporary solution (the same patch ported to
2.3.41+):
http://www.linuxvirtualserver.org/arp.html
http://www.linuxvirtualserver.org/hidden-2.3.41-1.diff
	It is not ported to 2.4 because it touches code in the
IP address autoselection that is in the fast path. This
autoselection code is going to be changed and the required support
can't be ported.
	The problem is complex and can't be solved with ifconfig -arp
	The needs for clusters with shared addresses include:
1. block ARP replies for such addresses
2. don't announce these addresses in the ARP probes (can be achieved
using ip addr add IP brd + dev lo scope host)
3. don't autoselect such addresses (for source addresses)
