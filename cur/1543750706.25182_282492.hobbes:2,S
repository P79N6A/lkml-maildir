Yes, it broke my NVIDIA module. I had to hack it to get it to work. Yes,
yes, I know NVIDIA bad and all that, but it is an example, and those
that have NVIDIA cards and want 3D graphics, need to bow to the evil
power that is.

IIRC, there was a big argument to what was going on in the 2.4.9->2.4.10
kernel. Mainly the new VM. Alan Cox didn't want to include it because a
change like that was too big for a stable release. Actually, I thought
that 2.4.0 -> 2.4.14 was still unstable, and didn't migrate much on my
"stable" machines, until 2.4.14. 
I think both approaches have their pros and cons. Maybe the problem is
that 2.x -> 2.x+1 is too slow.  If it was faster, then it wouldn't be a
problem. The way I develop applications/libraries is that if I change an
interface, it changes the second number, and if I make major changes the
first is changed. Maybe keep 2.6.x just for bug fixes (like usual) and
start 2.7 for updates and jump quicker to 2.8. When a major design is
done, that should be 3.0.  I believe that the kernel has settled with
the 2.6 series to not be jumping to something different as 2.4->2.6 did
any time soon. So maybe make 3.0 the next big change, and let the 2.x
rise quicker.
As to use the distribution kernels? People do that? The first thing I do
when installing a distribution, is to download and run the latests
kernel ;-)
