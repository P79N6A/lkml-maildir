1. They're harder to maintain out of tree.
2. they're written in some jibberish awk crap
3. They're slower. If you're doing thousands of tracepoints a second,
	into a circular 8GB log buffer, that *does* matter. You want
	to peturb what you're measuring as little as possible.
If you're running across thousands of systems, in live production, in
order to catch a rare race condition, the performance does matter.

I'm confused. You're saying that the dynamic tracers need help by
adding some static data to the kernel, and yet at the same time
rejecting static additions to the kernel on the grounds they have
no value???
Perhaps we're just meaning different things by static tracing. To me,
what is important is that there is a well-defined place in the source
code where the data needed to be logged, and the exact place to log
it at, is defined. If all that macro does to the compilation is add
a couple of nops, and make an entry in a symbol data, or other debug
data, for something to hook into later that's *fine*. The point is
to maintain the location and intelligence about *what* to trace.
Perhaps I'm calling that static, and you're calling it dynamic? Would
explain why we're disagreeing ;-) Seems to be exactly what you're
suggesting above?
If we want it to be superfast, we could compile with a different config 
option to insert some tracing statically in there or something, but I
agree it should not be the default.

Yes ;-) Realise that your usage model is not exactly the same as
everyone else's, and I don't give a damn if I have to recompile. I
realise other people do, but ....

Can you *really* trace *any* variable (stack variables, etc) at *any*
point within *any* function with kprobes? It didn't do that before,
and I find it hard to see how it could, given compiler optimizations,
etc.

Surely it's still there at the moment? ;-)
