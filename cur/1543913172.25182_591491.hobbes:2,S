Subject: [PATCH - RESUBMiT] Minor patch to pvr2 driver required for maple bus support on SEGA Dreamcast
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/9/4/166

The maple bus driver (
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/9/4/165
) uses hardware
synchronisation between the maple bus and the VBLANK to poll the maple
bus. This patch makes the interrupt shareable.
By definition the interrupt is for both devices.
