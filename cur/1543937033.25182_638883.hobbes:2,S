Subject: [PATCH] net_device refcnt bug when NFQUEUEing bridged packets

Hi,
I came across the following bug a few weeks ago (which still applies to
2.6.24-rc7):
Packets that are to be sent out over a bridge device are skb_clone()d in
br_loop() before traversing the appropriate (FORWARD/OUTPUT) NF chain. 
The copies made by skb_clone() share their nf_bridge metadata with the
original, which is no problem usually.
If however one or more packets of a br_loop() run end up in a NFQUEUE,
their shared nf_bridge metadata causes trouble when they are about to be
reinjected: nf_reinject() decrements the net_device refcounts that were
previously upped when queueing the packet in __nf_queue(), but as
skb->nf_bridge->physoutdev points to the same device for all these
packets, most (if not all) of them will affect the wrong refcnt.
(I originally encountered the bug on a Xen host because the hypervisor
refused to shutdown a virtual device with non-zero refcount... but it is
perfectly reproducible with a standard kernel, too, although it was a
bit more tedious to create a test scenario, involving a couple of UMLs.)
I'd suggest to make a real copy of the nf_bridge member in br_loop() if
CONFIG_BRIDGE_NETFILTER is defined - I've attached a patch that illus-
trates how to fix the bug (and the machine I've found the bug on is
running a kernel with this patch since weeks and has not had any
refcount anomalies since), but I admit it is ugly, returning the reference
acquired by __nf_copy() and then copying manually...
Please tell me where that logic should really go (skbuff.h? br_netfilter.c?)
so I can wrap up a final and CodingStyle-conformant version, or feel free
to simply apply a modified version.
Regards,
Jan
