Hi there
I've got a Tyan 2891 Barebone here and tried to compile kernel with
support for AMD 8131 PCI-X Controller
(Since via this controller a network-chip bcm5704 is connected on-board)
Link to chipset overview:
http://www.amd.com/us-en/Processors/TechnicalResources/0,,30_182_871_903
4%5E9504,00.html
Link to patch:
http://cdrom.amd.com/21860/updates/opteron_drivers/linux/amdshpc-1.1.9.t
ar.gz
This patch is described to be for 2.6.11.9 but I'm not able to compile
support for my 8131 (and sure the NIC as effect)
I tried multiple Kernels (such as 2.6.14, 2.6.12, 2.6.11.9)
My last try (2.6.14) resulted in the error message:
insmod amdshpc.ko
amdshpc: Unknown symbol reparent_to_init
insmod: error inserting '/lib/modules/2.6.14/...': -1 Unknown symbol in
module
I couldn't find any thread about this topic.
Surprisingly if I start "knoppix 3.91 with 2.8.11" the chipset is being
detected (lspci)
Do you have any idea for doing that?
I don't know what to try next... would be great :)
