Yeah.  RLIMIT_RSS seemed like something I could hijack for the
purpose, though.  And the code change was really small
( http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=103299570928378 ).
If only the darn program didn't have so many threads, RLIMIT_AS
or the no-overcommit patch would be perfect.  I unfortunately can't 
get rid of the threads, so I'm stuck trying to figure out some way
to kill the right program when the system gets low on memory.
Maybe I should look at giving the OOM killer hints?
