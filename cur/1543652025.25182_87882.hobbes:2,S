I'd go further than that. Where it's blatantly obvious that a standard 
kernel interface is going to be required for some functionality for which 
ACPI is the first implementation, that generic interface should have been 
implemented from the start.

Actually I do have boxes on which I "echo 1 > /proc/sys/pm/suspend" to make 
them sleep. Pavel's right though -- that's not a particularly wonderful 
interface either. Using sys_reboot() makes some sense to me.
But stuff like battery info in /proc/acpi just has no excuse.
