That's nice when someone is working for you. In this case I believe there
were multiple bugs, and the viable choices were to ship with the old known
bugs or do testing on the new version until it is accepted as tested.
Given that the release schedule seems to be measures in generations these
days, shipping a driver known to be bad is probably worse than doing one
more rc and asking people to beat hell out of the driver.

I bet your release schedule is more frequent, too. There comes a time when
doing a whole new QA is better than trying to be sure a fix works without
doing full QA anyway. As in both faster and more likely to result in a
correct result.
