Hi Johannes,
I am not too happy with putting this kind of switches into input layer,
it should be reserved for "real" buttons, ones that user can explicitely
push or toggle (lid switch is on the edge here but it and sleep button
are used for similar purposes so it makes sense to have it in input layer
too). But "cable X connected" kind of events is too much [for input layer,
there could well be a separate layer for it]. If we go this way we'd have
to move cable detection code from network to input layer as well ;)
