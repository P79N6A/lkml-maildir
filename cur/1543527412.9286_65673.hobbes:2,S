I disagree. I regularly use a floppy with a very large
file that I carry between home and work and edit in
emacs. I have been bitten on occasion (forgot to
unmount before popping and shutting down at 3am) but
overall I prefer that my emacs doesn't write a half
megabyte to a slow floppy everytime I change a 
character. QED.
