As of 2.6.16, I am seeing this message when I do suspend-to-RAM
from a text window:
Error: something went wrong performing real mode call
I've narrowed it down to coming from "vbetool post"
on resume from RAM.
This is Kubuntu-5.10 Breezy, with vbetool-0.3-1.
I'll trace it further when I have the opportunity.
Resume still appears to work, but overnight suspend/resume does not
always work -- not sure if that is related to this message,
or to some USB modules.
Cheers
