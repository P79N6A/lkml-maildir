List,
I am not subscribed so please CC or address any responses to me
directly. Thanks.
I was succesfully using the des patch found at
ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/Linux/BETA/loop/des.1.tar.gz
 to get encrypted
file systems using the loopback block device with 2.0.X kernels.(This
patch isn't as direct an installation as it says) I never got around to
trying it with 2.1.X kernels.
I recently acquired 2.2.X kernels and noticed that the loopback block
device has gone through a few revisions. The above des patch obviously
won't work. It looks like the thing now supports many more types of
encryption. The problem is there is nothing indicating where to find the
files to use those types of encryption. They don't seem to come with the
kernel. Could someone point me in the right direction?
Thanks,
Daniel Zahn
