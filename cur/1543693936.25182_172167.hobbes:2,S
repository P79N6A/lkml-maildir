 The patch should work but Andrew Morton didn't like the fact that in
 practice the kernel end's up having some threads around full time for
 the sole purpose of loading firmware once in a while.
 I should make a new patch to spawn a thread for each firmware load and
 have them die when the job is done. And stop using workqueues at all.
 	- Performance should not be an issue since firmware should
	  seldom be needed.
	- Code complexity shouldn't change much either.
 Comments are welcomed.
 If the issue seams urgent, the current "private workqueue" patch could
 be applied and replaced later with a cleaner solution.
 Just for the record I should get the job done within a couple of weeks.
 A proposal patch would of course help :)
 Have a nice day
 	Manuel
