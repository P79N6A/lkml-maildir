Why CONFIG_ISA_BROKEN. That implies (states) that its broken and
it's not. All modern ix86's have such a bus, even though it
doesn't go out to some connectors anymore. Just leave the 20-year-old
local bus, then called ISA, alone. ISA means:
               Industry Standard Architecture
It __is__! Don't muck with it.
