When the ES7000 Code was merged we asked Unisys about this and they
agreed to drop the nasty conflicting clauses (in fact it was just 
a mistake on their part - the code was always intended to be GPLed) 
The bogus comment may have leaked out in one or two revisions with 
the daily kernel snapshot.
openssl is only compiled as a module in released kernels, so it is similar to
the PPP BSD compression module.
I would recommend people check their facts and ask first before publicly 
accusing someone of violating the GPL.
