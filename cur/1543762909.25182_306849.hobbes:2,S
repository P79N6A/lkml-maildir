Oh, the code for kernel space is exactly the same code translated to C:
That is:
___________
#include <linux/vmalloc.h>
void mtestit(char val)
{
    char *buf;
    int i, j;
    int size = 64;
    int pass = 2 * 1024 * 1024;
    printk("starting val == %x\n", val);
    buf = vmalloc(size);
    printk("allocated memory of %d bytes. buf == %x\n", size, (int)buf);
    for (j = 0; j < pass; j++)
    {
        printk("passing %d", j);
        for (i = 0; i < size; i++)
        {
            buf[i] = val;
        }
        printk("passed\n");
    }
    printk("freeing\n");
    vfree(buf);
    printk("finished!\n");
}
___________
I call this in a module's entry point and insmod that module.
now, mtestit(0xff) works, but mtestit(0x00) crashes:(
Works fine with RedBoot. Very strange to me:)
Moreover, works fine if I do the very same thing from
within U-Boot (mw.b 100000 0 100000).
I'm interested in ideas of what could potentially be the
cause of this strange behaviour.
