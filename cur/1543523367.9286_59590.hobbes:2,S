My idea was that every scheduler would have a file of its own; something
like linux/kernel/sched/blaha1.c blaha2.c etc. Even if its just a few
one-liners in kernel/sched.c, a choice of several schedulers would mean
a LOT of one-liners in sched.c, thus very incomprehensible code.

Doesn't sound like too much fun, no...
