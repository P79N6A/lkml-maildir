I am not getting the complete picture. So, in unregister we would just
disable and never delete the notifier_block ? Or
notifier_block_enable/disable will be used by external entities
directly ?

But, how is the list protected in call_chain (will you be holding the
lock in call_chain() while incrementing the atomic variable).
