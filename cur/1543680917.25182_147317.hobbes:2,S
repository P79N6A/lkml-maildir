Sigh.  I meant the kernel behaviour is idiotic.  Returning -EINVAL would
have been much better behaviour.

We've lived with it for this long.
The behaviour is "undefined".  Any application which uses O_RDONLY|O_TRUNC
is buggy.
If we were to alter the behaviour now, any buggy-but-happens-to-work app
which is accidentally using O_RDONLY|O_TRUNC may break.  And now is not the
time to break things.
Given that the behaviour is undefined, the behaviour which we should
implement is clearly "whatever 2.4 is doing".  So let's leave it alone.
