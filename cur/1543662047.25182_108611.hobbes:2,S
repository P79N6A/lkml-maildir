It's fighting an already lost battle. 16bit ipid space is far too small
to do any rewriting tricks. You just don't have enough space to 
space them out enough, especially when there is latency in the network.

Just do it without NAT on Gigabit with small packets. The ipids wrap
so fast you get data corruption very quickly.  Most of it is catched
by the UDP checksum, but not everything. You can work around it by 
setting the ip defragment timeout very short, but that makes it unusable
for a WAN.
Using IP fragmentation these days is in general a bug.  I regard it at
the same level as using UDP without checksums.  Use path MTU discovery
or a stronger protocol like SCTP.  Alternatively Ipv6 with 32bit
fragment ids, but even that is too small for multi gigabit speeds.
