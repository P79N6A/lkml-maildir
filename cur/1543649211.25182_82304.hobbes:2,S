I am not an expert of cacheline bouncing, so please point me if I miss
something.  I wonder if we could reduce the bounce even with current
design (the spinlock is in the data it protects).  We have to go through
that array anyway to get access to the data (and the spinlock).

OK, I will back to original design.
