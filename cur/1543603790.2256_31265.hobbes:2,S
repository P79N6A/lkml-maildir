I see this regularly on one of my systems, and hdparm has never even
been insatalled on that system. If I put the drive in a different
system, the drive reports clean, but whatever drive I put in here
regularly reports that problem.
As far as I can tell, it's a problem with the PSU in the computer in
question, as I can swap ANYTHING else in there, motherboard included,
without the problem going away on that drive, but as soon as I swap
the PSU, the problems vanish - even if I put a PSU with a lower rating
in its place.

Who says hdparm has anything to do with it?
Best wishes from Riley.
