Why do you use this special zero_id stuff? It clutters up the whole
code.
If you would simply open a normal shm segment with key IPC_PRIVATE and
directly remove it nobody can attach to it and it will be released on
exit and everything. No special handling needed any more. BTW that's
exectly what we do in user space to circumvent the missing MAP_ANON |
MAP_SHARED.
I would also prefer to be able to see the allocated segments with the
ipc* commands.
