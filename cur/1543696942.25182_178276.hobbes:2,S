there is a seq_file->private pointer where you can store private (per file 
structure) data. That is what I do and it works very nice, BUT the problem 
is that the ->private pointer was only added to seq_file recently 
(2.4.20 if I remember correctly) although seq_file API was present since 
2.4.15.
Kind regards
