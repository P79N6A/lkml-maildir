My dual Tyan runs Q3A, UT, and Tribes 2 at over 100fps at times with no problems UNLESS I enable DMA for the IDE drive. Q3a will go above 130fps (map and game
dependent), UT will go even higher, and Tribes 2 will hit right around 140fps if I'm in a room (any outdoor areas slow WAY down).
I am running 2.4.9ac10 with a few minor tweaks, agpgart slightly tweaked compiled in, and a tweaked Detonator 3 nVidia driver. I plan to upgrade all these soon
and see what happens.
My A7V133 however is crap when it comes to playing games. It's been demoted to straight server duty. :)
