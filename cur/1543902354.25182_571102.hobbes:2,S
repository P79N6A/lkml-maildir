This was badly worded.  They're "suboptimal" for use by i386 (ie. they
clash with the i386 declaration and they'd need lots of casts to convert
the code).
Of course, treating them as 2 32-bit values on x86-64 *is* suboptimal,
and this patch helps that, but that wasn't what I was talking about.

Yep.   But my first attempt was to simply #include
<asm-x86_64/desc_defs.h> from asm-i386, and that doesn't work fine 8(
Thanks,
Rusty.
