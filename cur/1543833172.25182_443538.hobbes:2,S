it doesn't matter :)
2.6.17 code is:
                        do_each_thread(g, p)
                                if (p->uid == who)
                                        error = set_one_prio(p, niceval, error);
                        while_each_thread(g, p);
when introducing process namespaces we will have to isolate processes somehow and this loop, agree?
in this case 1 user-namespace can belong to 2 process-namespaces, agree?
how do you see this loop in the future making sure that above situation is handled correctly?
how many other such places do we have?

the problem is not in find_user() actually. but in uid comparison inside
some kind of process iteration loop.
In this case you select processes p which belong to both namespaces simultenously:
i.e. processes p which belong both to user-namespace U and process-namespace P.
I hope I was more clear this time :)

why? we do it fine in OpenVZ.
