21264 Compiler Writer's Guide [appendix C] explicitly says that the
second load cannot issue if its address depends on a result of previous
load until that result is available. I refuse to believe that it isn't
true for older alphas, especially because they are strictly in-order
machines, unlike ev6.
I suspect some confusion here - probably that architect meant loads
to independent addresses. Of course, in this case mb() is required
to assure ordering.
Ivan.
