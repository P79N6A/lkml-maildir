Linux gurus,
On a Compaq Deskpro EP/SB series with PII 400/100MHZ & 64MB machine, 
when booting RedHat Linux 5.1 or 5.2 (I don't try other linux 
distributions), sometimes the keyboard will be locked and not response 
to any keypress after login prompt displayed on the screen, sometimes 
everything is ok, why?
