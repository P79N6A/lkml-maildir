Hi,
This was my first attempt with Linux 2.6, so the
userspace environment was still predominantly 2.4 when
this happened. The machine is a dual P4 Xeon with 1 GB
RAM, ACPI and HT enabled:

And I'm afraid that's all the information that I have,
except that I was trying to export an NFS mount from
this machine at the time and was failing miserably. (I
suspect that this might have been because "ifconfig lo
127.0.0.1" hadn't created an entry in the routing
table... if that makes any sense?) The last entries in
my log file were:
...

There doesn't seem to be a ksymoops for 2.6. Is there
anything else I need to do to this oops?
