Subject: [2.6.24 patch] Fix blackfin HARDWARE_PM support
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

(Robin, can you check if this patch does what is currently intended with
HARDWARE_PM please ? This involves testing with CONFIG_OPROFILE y/m/n.)
This patch restores the blackfin Hardware Performance Monitor Profiling
support that was killed by
commit 09cadedbdc01f1a4bea1f427d4fb4642eaa19da9.
Since there seems to be no good reason to behave differently from other
architectures, it now automatically selects the hardware performance counters
whenever the profiling is activated.
mach-common/irqpanic.c: pm_overflow
calls pm_overflow_handler which is in oprofile/op_model_bf533.c. I doubt that
setting HARDWARE_PM as "m" will work at all, since the pm_overflow_handler
should be in the core kernel image because it is called by irqpanic.c.
Therefore, I change HARDWARE_PM from a tristate to a bool.
The whole arch/$(ARCH)/oprofile/ is built depending on CONFIG_OPROFILE. Since
part of the HARDWARE_PM support files sits in this directory, it makes sense to
also depend on OPROFILE, not only PROFILING. Since OPROFILE already depends on
PROFILING, it is correct to only depend on OPROFILE only.
