Well the reporters, and vendorsec, have to be aware that the 
"kernel security list" is the main discussion point of kernel security issues.
If the embargo period is reasonable for vendors to prepare their updates and 
do necessary QA, there should be no need for kernel issues to be coordinated 
(and embargoed) on vendorsec anymore. Does it make sense?
Of course vendorsec gets informed of what is happening at "kernel security list".
The main reason for reporters to require "permission" to spread the information
is because they want make a PR of their discovery, yes?
In that case they should be aware that submitting to vendorsec means submitting
to kernel security, and that means X days of embargo period.
