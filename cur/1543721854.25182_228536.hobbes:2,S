Subject: FW: Patch for multiport serial MOXA boards - kernel.2.4.25 - mxser.c

kernel.2.4.25
The moxa drivers currently do not work with devfs support in linux. Most
people are migrating to devfs, as I have. These are the lines that need
fixed in mxser.c. Devfs attempts to create the device when its registered,
so you cannot register all the ports with the same name. The fix is pretty
obvious and I hope this email makes it to the right person. Any questions,
just let me know. Thanks.
