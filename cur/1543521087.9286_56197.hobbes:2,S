This is absolutely true.  The question is not whether your old 486 will still
be in service in 2037 but whether *any* 32 bit cpus will still be in service. 
And it's a dead certainty that they will.  What do we think will be running on
our wristwatches and phones?  Even 40 years from now, 64 bit cpus will just be
a waste of power and space for many embedded applications.
It seems to me this is a *tiny* thing to fix, given that applications and
libraries have 37 years to migrate to a slightly new syscall, as long as the
bad old way of doing things remains available.  OK, I'll stop now - I suppose my
point would have been made better if I'd also attached a patch :-)
