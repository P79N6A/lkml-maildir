Another thing you could be doing is not zeroing swapper->nr
if the shrinker function doesn't do anything, in order to try
to maintain pressure on the dcache. This would be similar to
your deferred list idea.
But I guess that using 0 order allocations for these GFP_NOFS
caches means you would be losing far less dcache pressure in
this way, so it might not make much difference.
