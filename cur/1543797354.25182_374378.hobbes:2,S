I am slow today... I don't see any dependencies on CONFIG_HOTPLUG in
drivers/base... Or you talking about one particular subsystem that
handles this correctly?

I dont think this is a valid argument.

I think we could take the semaphore before checking driver and then
use __device_release_driver(). But we'd need to make it global or move
bind/unbind code into drivers/base/dd.c
