Very old myth. In fact just about every scheduler on the planet exploits
the fact this is untrue.
		save state
		continue running doing scheduler stuff
		restore other state losing the state in the middle we dont need
Ditto with a lot of I/O devices. My audio save state and suspend can be
seperated - I might play a little bit of a song twice but is that a bug
?
