Matthew,
4 years ago you have patched the Locking document and changed the BKL rule for
remount_fs()
# ChangeSet
#   2003/08/21 00:28:27-07:00 akpm@osdl.org
#   [PATCH] update Documentation/filesystems/Locking
#   From: Matthew Wilcox <willy@debian.org>
locking rules:
 	All may block.
-		BKL	s_lock	mount_sem
-remount_fs:	yes	yes	maybe		(see below)
+			BKL	s_lock	s_umount
+remount_fs:		no	yes	maybe		(see below)
As far as I understand it was a misprint, de-facto BKL is required at least for
reiserfs, where is a long-lived check. Also I've found that currently
remount_fs() is called only from do_remount_sb(), which is called with taken BKL
in all cases:
- do_umount() and do_emergency_remount() acquires BKL directly;
- do_remount() which called from do_mount() with taken BKL;
- get_sb_single() which called from .get_sb() and should have BKL too
If you have not any objections I would like to fix this issue by the patch from
the following letter.
thank you,
	Vasily Averin
