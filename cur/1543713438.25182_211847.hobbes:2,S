I meant to say that the first ones already define 
I2C_ADAP_CLASS_TV_ANALOG correctly, but the latter ones not. But because 
of the fact that these are my drivers, there won't be any problems 
adding the class type and verifying the correctness afterwards.

Hm, if you consider 2.6.4 old, then yes. Please remember that I'm only a 
i2c core system user, so I simply took the most recent 2.6 version which 
was available.

Ah, ok, there were double entries when I grepped through the code, so 
the drivers defined different i2c busses then.

Hm, ok. Because we don't know for sure, we should probably do what I 
propose below.

I like 1 best, but this would be 2.7 stuff. We cannot break working 
configurations for 2.6.
So I tend to use I2C_CLASS_ALL for all drivers we definately not know 
and add a big fat #warning preprocessor message, with an url explaining 
the background (i.e. "this driver doesn't have the correct i2c class 
set. if you are interested in having this driver fixed, have a look at 
http://foo
 for further informations."
> Frankly I don't know.
If we have agreed on one model, we need to create a big patch and get it 
into the kernel.
I think it would be best if Greg could get it in with his patchsets. 
Greg, is this ok for you or do you have any other proposals?
CU
Michael.
