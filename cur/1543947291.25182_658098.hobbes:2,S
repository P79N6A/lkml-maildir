This is probably the old version you came across. It was tightly coupled
to a particular PMIC and SoC CPU and not portable. The new version that
I posted is portable and not tied to a particular PMIC or CPU
architecture. The new version is hosted in the audioplus git repository
(imx31 branch).

The WM8350 and MC13783 are both multi feature PMIC's like above. We
handle WM8350 PMIC access via a bus manager. This controls IO access to
the WM8350 so that client driver (including the regulator driver) IO
does not collide. We also cache non volatile PMIC registers to speed up
access. Please have a look at drivers/regulator/wm8350/wm8350-bus.c in
the imx31 branch for details.
