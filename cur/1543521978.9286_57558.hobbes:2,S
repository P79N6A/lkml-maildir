Okay, no big code change there. try_to_swap_out() can probably still accept 
a "zone" argument, like it currently does, except that it does not need
to use it. I assume this would also hold for shm_swap()?

Yes, that's what everyone seems to be pointing at. As I mentioned, I am
looking into this as I type. The only thing is, as Andrea points out, 
2.3 bh/irq handlers do not request HIGHMEM pages, so shouldn't the
2.3 kswapd do something more like: 
       more_work = 0;
       for (i = 0; i < MAX_NR_ZONES; i++) {
		if (i != ZONE_HIGHMEM)
               		more_work |= balance_zone(zone+i)
       }
       if (!more_work)
               sleep()
