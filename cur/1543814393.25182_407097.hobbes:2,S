Your patch (applied to 2.6.16-rc6) seems to work on the MV88SX6081 too.
I have two Maxtor disks connected and in a raid0 configuration. The
array is both fast and stable. I see no error messages in dmesg and no
data corruption.
I have yet to test if raid5 works well too, so I'll report on that
later. It didn't work a month ago:

Thanks a lot for your patch!
	Kind regards, Sander
