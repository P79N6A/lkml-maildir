Well ... that's because the logic that decides whether to plug the queue
or simply exit is in the scsi_request_fn().  That's what the comment is
about.  We could abstract the check into a function, but (unless you
have any suggestions on rewording it) I thought the comment made what
was going on reasonably clear.
