thanks, that narrows it down quite a bit. (We've double-checked the 
lapic path and it seemed all our changes are NOP, but obviously it isnt 
and we'll check it all again.)
(if you have that kernel still booted by any chance then do you see the 
'LOC' IRQ count in /proc/interrupts or any other count in /proc/stats 
increasing at an alarming rate? That would narrow it down to lapic timer 
misprogramming.)
