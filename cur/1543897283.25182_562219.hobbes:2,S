I should have been more specific in the changelog.  My understanding is 
that AMD systems don't need it for memory above 4G, and since the code 
doesn't handle holes (no test systems, nor any real reports that I've 
seen), it's not that useful for finding problems below 4G.  We can 
always change that later if needed though.
Thanks,
Jesse
