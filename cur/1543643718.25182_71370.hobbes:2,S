Manfred, could you please turn MMIO (you can select it
via kernel config) and see what the new difference looks like?
I am not so sure with that 6% difference there is no other bug lurking
there; 6% seems too large for an extra two PCI transactions per packet.
If someone could test a different NIC this would be great.
Actually what would be even better is to go something like 20kpps,
50kpps, 80 kpps, 100kpps and 140 kpps and see what we get.
cheers,
jamal
