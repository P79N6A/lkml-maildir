Prior to 2.6.19, dm-crypt passes write barrier requests through to the
underlying device in the order received unmodified (the ordering).
In 2.6.19 and newer, these writes are now passed through a workqueue.
On an SMP box running encrpytion for write requests in parallel,
wouldn't this cause the requests to arrive to the device in a
different order?  A 2.6.22 patch from Milan Broz sets dm-crypt to
disable barriers, but if this disabling is being handled at the
filesystem level, is there still a chance of data becoming corrupt?
I'm currently running an unpatched 2.6.20 kernel on an SMP machine
testing the validity of some static files going back and forth through
dm-crypt on an XFS filesystem mounted with nobarrier to be sure, and
so far I'm not noticing anything, but this is hardly a good test.
Suggestions or any other way to help out appreciated.
