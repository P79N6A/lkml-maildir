So it is.  I was mistaken because it was late at night, and I read this 
entry in the to-do list:
+ * -- use serial numbers to hook onto same hosts (same minor) after
disconnect
That feature is present in usb-storage for 2.4 but not 2.6, so I assumed 
there would be no reason to add it to ub for 2.6 either.
