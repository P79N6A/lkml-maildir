  Hi, all. Version 10 of my msr patch is now available from:
http://www.atnf.csiro.au/~rgooch/linux/kernel-patches.html
Some documentation is also available here.
The patch provides user space access to Model-Specific Registers (MSRs)
and Performance Monitoring Counters (PMCs) via device driver interfaces.
The patch also includes a crude page colouring algorithm (off by
default) and improvements for the MTRR interface.
This is against 2.2.0+devfs. Highlights of this release:
- Removed diagnostic printk() in <check_cx686_cpuid> added in previous
  patch version
- Supported page colouring on all architectures
				Regards,
					Richard....
