The exact status is that gcc has outlawed this usage[*] for ages, but gcc
on ia32 (and a few other targets) never enforced the restriction, "almost
always" doing the right thing. Unfortunately, this has been used quite
extensively in the linux kernel. From the egcs-19981213 or so development
snapshot of egcs on this is now a fatal error. My fixes to the offending
asm()s are in Alan Cox's patchsets <
ftp://ftp.uk.linux.org/pub/linux/alan/>
for 2.1 and 2.2 kernels. Currently linux-2.2.0-pre1-ac4 is running here
(i586/100 UP), compiled without -fno-strength-reduce and -march=pentium
instead of the customary '-m486 -malign-...' with egcs-19981226. ppa works
fine, AFAIKS.
[*] The problem is in asm()s that modify one of the inputs. This has been
    marked by adding the input register to the clobber list, which is
    illegal. The right way to do this is to set up a dummy variable that is
    used as output, and marking the asm() as volatile.

No need, unless you are talking about some other problems unknown to me?

Why will it require egcs? AFAIKS, what is legal asm() for egcs is legal for
others too. Perhaps you'll need a specific binutils?
