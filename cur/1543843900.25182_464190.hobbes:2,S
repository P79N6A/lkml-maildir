If I may : I showed in a precedent thread that kprobes impact doubled LTTng's
impact on the system. If you are interested in numbers about LTTng, here they
are :
"The LTTng tracer : A Low Impact Performance and Behavior Monitor for GNU/Linux"
(OLS2006)
http://ltt.polymtl.ca/papers/desnoyers-ols2006.pdf
(and for Ingo : I haven't rerun the tests on your modified kprobes, it will
come in time. But I do not really expect that 30-50 cycles compared to 1500
will make a very big difference.)
