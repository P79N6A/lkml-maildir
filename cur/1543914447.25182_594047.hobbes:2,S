Exactly.  The kernel will by default get the device up and working.  Any
capabilities to be changed after it is working can be done by userspace
with a "whitelist" type program that can properly tell the kernel that
this specific device can be safely suspended.
If you decide to do this in a small bash script, or in
HAL/udevd/DeviceKit/whatever, it all doesn't matter to the kernel.
