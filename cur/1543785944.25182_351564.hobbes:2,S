Hi,
I'm trying to get some information on a card plugged on a PCI bus.
The driver exist only for Windows, so I try to spy the PCI bus under
Windows XP and trying to get the content of the commands to the chipset
of the card.
I am using this Windows PCI sniffer (with the -D option):

Unfortunately, whatever I do with the card, I only get one type of
memory image (the one displayed when the card is uninitialized).
So, I guess I do something wrong.
Does anybody get some experience in PCI sniffing under Windows XP ?
What are the good softwares to use, the tricks to know, etc.
Any help is welcome.
Just for your interest, the chipset that I'm trying to analyse is this
one:
