I don't think there is a good way for you to convert over to
_register_driver(), that's the main reason I'm keeping the pci_find_*
functions around, they are quite useful for lots of situations.
It doesn't sound like you are worrying about your device working in a
pci hotplug system, and you would probably be willing do any pci device
conversion work to the new driver model yourself, right?  :)
