# Aha. So how do you propose to make tar(1) and friends work? BTW, I think
# that the whole idea of forked files is fundamentally flawed - solutions
# proposed in that thread are very, erm, convincing in that respect. And
# idea of changing the glob behaviour... Urgh.
First, go back and read my (admittedly long) messages in which I explain
*exactly* how to do this. Also, take note that tar doesn't work on NTFS at
the moment, and won't unless we provide this kind of support.
Second, I'm not at all proposing that glob behaviour be changed - I'm
proposing that streams aren't made to look like files and files with
streams aren't made to look like directories - because they're not.
