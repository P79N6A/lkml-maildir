[ slow deleting of 25GB, horrible latency ]
Hmmm, I'd be curious to see how 2.4.9-ac16 (or 2.4.10) performs there.  The
reiserfs delete code should be scheduling enough due to transaction
stop/starts that interactive performance isn't that bad.
You should be able to repeat your results by doing the same tests on sparse
files:
dd if=/dev/zero of=foo bs=1M count=1 seek=250000
