We have legions of these all over the tree. How about you put
them into some central file and gc a few?

The standard way to do this is to use asm-offsets.c

Hmmm? This doesn't look like something a header file should be doing.
How about you put that big list and the definition into a .c ?

I don't think that file can be reviewed in any meaningful way before
you don't get rid of the macro mess and the unneeded calling conventions.
