I think the root issue there is that it's hard to get all testers to
run a bisect, but easy to ask them to test snapshots. Right now the
snapshots are generated nightly, but I think it would make more sense
if they were generated every N patches, for some value of N...
Of course, for that to really work, we have to ensure that the result
is always compilable, which has been getting better, but not perfect.
