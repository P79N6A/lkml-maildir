It's about having threaded interrupts soft and hard, and their
combinations.  disable_irq with threaded hardirqs can schedule, but we
still don't want a softirq to do so (when not threaded).
So it too is tricky.

Well, it seems that the spin_lock_irq for -rt is the answer for now, until
we sort out the dependencies of threaded interrupts.
Ingo,
Maybe it will be necessary to make hardirq threading dependent on softirq
threading.
Is it really that bad?  When would someone want Hardirq threading without
having softirq threading??
