Hello,
I mount my bootdisk (minix filesystem) with "mount /dev/fd0 /mnt" and copy my 
new compiled kernel to it. After that I do a "lilo -v -C /mnt/lilo.conf".
All following commands which are floppy related (filesystem) fall into the D 
state. Load goes up by 100 for every D state process.
ls /mnt
umount /mnt
sync
SunWave1#cat /proc/version
Linux version 2.4.5-ac16 (root@SunWave1) (gcc version 2.95.2 19991024 
(release)) #1 Wed Jun 20 18:01:34 CEST 2001
SunWave1#ps aux
root      1039  0.0  0.0  1404   64 pts/1    D    16:24   0:00 umount /mnt
nuetzel   1108  0.1  0.1  1412  500 pts/5    D    16:28   0:00 sync
Even "reboot" do nothing. I have to push the reset button.
Luckily I have ReiserFS running and only some seconds to wait during bootup 
for replay the transaction logs.
But mount/umount other disk partitions works as expected.
Thanks,
	Dieter
