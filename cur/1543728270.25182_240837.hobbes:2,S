Since the last time I tested this, things have
improved dramatically. This is 2.6.8-rc1 now; I had
been mostly using 2.6.0-test5 and 2.6.0-test11.
Still, I do get problems from:
1. resizing any window (oroborus wm + GNOME)
2. switching out of X with Alt-Ctrl-F1
3. switching into X with Alt-Ctrl-F7
I suppose this means that it is somewhat likely that
burning a CD without CAP_SYS_RESOURCE would work.
I doubt I'd like to risk my time and money on this,
but at least it isn't looking like failure would
be much more likely than success.
It irritates me that I'd need to compile up a hacked
cdrecord in order to attempt a dummy burn as a
regular user. Those warnings are treated as errors.
Grrr... If SuSE, OSDL, IBM, SGI, HP or Red Hat would
put up the money, I'd gladly fix this POS. Anybody
care enough?
FWIW, my desktop machine is:
450 MHz Mac G4 Cube, 512 MB RAM, 1600x1024 32bpp,
5400 rpm IDE, ext2, no swap, 2.6.8-rc1 kernel,
USB audio, ATI Rage 128 PF/PRO AGP 4x TMDS video
I run sound through esd, like this: mpg321 -o esd ...
Commonly, the X server grows to 300 MB and/or Mozilla
grows to 200 MB before I restart them. An old GNOME
is running with 8 desktops, Evolution and one or two
dozen xterms.
