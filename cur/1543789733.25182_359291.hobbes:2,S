I'm not sure what you are trying to do here ... If pci_alloc_* failed,
you do kmalloc(...,GFP_KERNEL) which can give you memory above your DMA
mask. Then, you use dma_map_* but that won't help much more neither.
Unless you have an iommu (or swiotlb) _and_ that implements arbitrary
DMA masks support (which it typically doesn't it's often 32 bits vs. 64
bits) it won't help, you'll get into your error case.
So basically, what you are doing is: if allocation fails, you try to get
memory using GFP_KERNEL. If it happens to be in the low 2Gb of memory,
use it, if not, drop it.
Did I get that right ?
Note that the Broadcom wireless (which is currently being reverse
engineered) seem to suffer from the same stupid DMA engine...
Ben.
