In general when changing semantics drastically you should force
compile errors by renaming the respective entry point. That
has been the standard Linux method for this for years.
I've been also pondering a variant of 1, but 3 might be better.

I doubt it will be very interesting, but it would be useful.
The goal less being to get rid of BKL in old drivers, but not 
requiring BKL in new drivers. Basically all BKL assumptions
in interfaces really should go.
