Eh, controllers don't cache data, they don't have the memory for
it, they are just stupid in-between-things which translate
signal levels (at about)

Well, it seems than that a dot is printed between floppy reads and
the compact options made it one big read, hence the one dot.
I must say I find that strange, because you can only get atmost
9 sectors or you will run of the side of the floppy! :)
So I would expect atleast some 33 dots, each for the 350/9
tracks the kernel occupies.
