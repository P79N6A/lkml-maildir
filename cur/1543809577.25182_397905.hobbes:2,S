Unfortunately it won't.  Charles' problem is different (and the BUG
output is different!) - soft lockup got triggered for PIO handling in
ide-cd driver.  This patch fixes the problem only for generic ATA PIO
routines (disks and [P]IDENTIFY), ATAPI PIO still needs fixing
(ide-cd/floppy/tape/scsi drivers).
Andrew, there is no "high level" function for ATAPI PIO as
ide_pio_datablock() for ATA PIO so fixing soft lockup false positives
would require going through all drivers and adding bunch of
touch_softlockup_watchdog() or using sledge-hammer approach
and touching watchdog in ide-iops.c:atapi_[input,output]_bytes().
BTW Charles' OOPS is for tainted (P) kernel (fglrx loaded)
