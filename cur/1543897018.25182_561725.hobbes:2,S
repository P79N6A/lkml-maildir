No, that's not an active one as Krzysztof wrote already.
The GAL only does some simple things.

I have the 32bit version of these cards:

As you can see, the cards are a 1:1 extension to the center slot.
The lower as well as the upper slot gets the additional signals from
the two small PCBs which are the four INTA...INTD and the REQest and
GraNT lines. The IDSELect's are soldered via 220R resistors to some
address lines.

> As you can see the two cards are sharing the IRQ properly.
IRQ sharing is possible. But on the PCI Bus, the usually four
IRQ lines are wired in a "Round Robin" scheme to avoid IRQ sharing.
Additionally, each slot gets a unique ID by wiring the IDSELect
of the slot connector to an AD bus line on the motherboard as
mentioned above.
So, each slot with a ID get it's fixed IRQ routed (along with the
REQn/GNTn lines). If the IDs and the IRQ lines don't fit together,
you might run into problems like you mentioned.
I think it's possible to tell the kernel the right ID-IRQ routing
associations manually. But I think it's not easy to get the BIOS fixed.
So, I suggest to figure out how the BIOS (the kernel get that
info from the BIOS, AFAIK (is that correct?)) wants to see its IRQ
on the IDs and rewire the riser card that they all fit together.
Well... that's what I did some time ago. For me it is more easy
to fit the hardware once to the default kernel settings instead of
patching every kernel on my embedded platform.
You can find some more details here:

%5Cspecs%5CATX_Spec_V1_0.pdf
And there is the official PCI Spec at 
http://www.pcisig.com
however you have to be a member of the PCI SIG.
Good luck,
