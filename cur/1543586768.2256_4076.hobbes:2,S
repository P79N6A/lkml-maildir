Have you actually tried to create lots of threads?
IIRC get_pid will loop forever if it doesn't find a free pid, and in the
worst case you can trigger that with ~11000 running threads.
And the current code can create multiple threads with the same pid (I
never tried to trigger that bug, but it seems to be possible)
