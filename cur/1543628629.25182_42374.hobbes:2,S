I don't know how to say this any other way, reread my second sentence
again. I have the disk and CD on separate cables, it still hangs. I NEVER
mix a CD with anything and expect good response. The IDE devices are
hanging, not just the one sharing the cable, nothing shares the cable but
a ZIP drive I use a few times a year when someone sends me a ZIP,
otherwise it's unused. The disk drive is all by itself, as I said the
first time I mentioned this.
I suspect (without having a good way to check) that all IDE devices
sharing the IRQ with the error device *may* be affected. That's the only
thing which comes to mind, I'll add a Promise controller and disk on a
totally separate board and see if that changes anything. Hopefully it will
not share the IRQ :-(
