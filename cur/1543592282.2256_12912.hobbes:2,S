Drives have remapping capability, but it's the first I've heard of HD 
firmware doing it automatically. I'd be very interested in reading 
the relevant documentation, if you could provide a pointer. Seems to 
me if a drive *could* do this, you'd certainly want to turn it 
(automatic remapping) off. There's way too much chance that a system 
will read the remapped sector and assume that it contains the 
original data. That would be hopelessly corrupting.
