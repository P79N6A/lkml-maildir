2.00.00 is queued for 2.6.18 once it opens up.
Are you seeing some specific problem with the driver in 2.6.16 that makes
this an essential upgrade for you ? If so, I'll investigate and get
the relevent fix into 2.6.16.21
Theres one oops fix which should go in, but other than that,
it's mostly been cleanups and support for next generation hardware
which isn't even shipping yet.
