You need to use a more recent version of smartctl -- one with better
documentation and clearer output.  Get smartmontools 5.1-18 from
http://smartmontools.sourceforge.net/
 and read the documentation. Don't
use the 5.19 release -- it's flawed.
This should answer your questions. If not, post the output from (the
smartmontools 5.1-18 version of) smartctl -a and I'll comment.
[Regarding the temperature, the Drive ID string in your output was:
Device: IC35L120AVV207-0 which is an IBM/Hitachi drive, not a Samsung
drive as you stated in your original post.  If so, the drive stores three
temperatures internally in six bytes.  smartmontools will display all
three temperatures (current, lifetime min and lifetime max).  The outdated
version of smartctl that you are using simply prints the bottom four of
the six bytes -- hence the very large number] .
Cheers,
