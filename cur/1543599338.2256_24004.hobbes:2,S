IHMO applications should be able to fallback to read() if mmap() doesn't
work.

Probably.  The driver should support at least one of the standard
VIDEO_PALETTE_* formats.  It is fine to pick one which comes close to
the native format of the camera, there is no need to support _all_
formats.

8bpp grayscale should be no problem with xawtv.  I'd suspect you will
not find any app which can deal with 16bpp, there isn't even a
VIDEO_PALETTE_* #define for this ...
