it complements unshare(). The purpose of this syscall is to unshare a
namespace after the process has been flushed.

We need a clean context with no reference in other namespaces to make
unshare safe. It seemed easier to add an improved execve() with an extra
flag than to modify unshare() to make it flush the old exec.
Now, that does not make unshare() useless. It's perfectly acceptable for
uts namespace. But IMO, it's dangerous for ipc namespace and user namespace
which are more complex because they have references all over the place :
network with socket, mm for shmem, files for accounting.
thanks,
