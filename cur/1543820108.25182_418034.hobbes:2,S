I'm just adding a new feature "for free":
- Without adding any new syscall
- Without changing the prototype of the current syscall (sys_getrusage)
- Ensuring backward compatibility (all old programs will continue to work properly)
This new feature can be used by any process that needs to profile another process for whatever reason.
Since it just adds a new feature without any drawback, I don't understand why it would be wrong...

I think you're wrong: I'm not introducing any *new* scalability issue. 
Currently the code is:
asmlinkage long sys_getrusage(int who, struct rusage __user *ru)
{
        if (who != RUSAGE_SELF && who != RUSAGE_CHILDREN)
                return -EINVAL;
        return getrusage(current, who, ru);
}
which in turn calls
int getrusage(struct task_struct *p, int who, struct rusage __user *ru)
{
        struct rusage r;
        read_lock(&tasklist_lock);
        k_getrusage(p, who, &r);
        read_unlock(&tasklist_lock);
        return copy_to_user(ru, &r, sizeof(r)) ? -EFAULT : 0;
}
As you can see, the lock is acquired also when not needed. That's how it is currently implemented.
With my patch, k_getrusage is called directly from sys_getrusage without going through getrusage.
