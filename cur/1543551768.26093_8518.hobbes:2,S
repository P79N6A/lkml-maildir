That depends on what you need. If the question is about the protocols,
then the best source I've found is the X/Open doc at
  
http://www.opengroup.org/publications/catalog/c702.htm
that covers the NFS + mount + NLM (locking) + NSM (statd) protocols,
and is available on the Web.
If, however, you're talking about documentation on the specific Linux
implementations, then I'm afraid that the best I can do is to point
you to the actual source code. You'll find the latest version (and/or
instructions about how to access the CVS repository) on
  
http://sourceforge.net/projects/nfs/
Cheers,
  Trond
