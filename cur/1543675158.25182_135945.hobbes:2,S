Paulo,
I would say make dep was deprecated around 2.5.23.  In 2.5.60, in the root
Makefile, the target was reduced to a simple warning.  I would call this
'obsoleted'.  As far as I can tell, only one Makefile still utilizes the
dep target, and this may be an oversight.  So how about this patch:

-       This command does two things.  First, it computes dependency
