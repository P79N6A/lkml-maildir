Hi , Trond
As I wrote , another persone has similar problems on PC's,  as to me it 
was a big suprise to see such a problem in nfs, cause i'm using it for 
over 10 yers in a different setups's OS's , etc. Yes I have tcpdump , 
and as i wrote, nothing wrong is going on with packet receiption,  where 
is now corrupted packets , no error messages, NOTHING !!!! Just RPC 
request gets lost, I mean not correctly connected to the some queue or 
caller. It last for over a year ,  and is a big pain in the ass of 
company i'm working for now.
With best regards, Vladimir.
