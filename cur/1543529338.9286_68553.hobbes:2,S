List adds: (all relative to recent kernel versions)
(serious)
 - pcmcia in normally causes OOPS on removal of cards
 - something odd with tulip pcmcia causes loss of keyboard and mouse for X
    when card is inserted.  irq for card is normally 3, ps2 mouse is on 12
 - tulip is broken, once the link state is set up/down, it can't be set up
    again.  in work w/ j. garzik i believe, related to softnet?
 - rmmod/modprobe of tulip can frequently lock up machine dead, no on screen
    OOPS, related to softnet?
 - Block->Use PCI DMA by default when available causes hda lost interrupt
    and kernel lock on boot, enabling dma after boot works, unknown status
(desired)
 ACPI userland utils and API dox :)
 irda and ppp namespace collisions
 bttv is dependant on i2c bitbanging int, config doesn't know about it
(trivial)
 menuconfig "Misc devices" blank, to be removed?
