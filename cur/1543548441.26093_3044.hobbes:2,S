Larry,
    It would be interesting to see the speed difference between bk and cvs
for the mozilla sources.  Doing a cvs update takes at least 10 minutes even
if no files have changed.  It took significantly longer when I was using
a modem instead of a DSL line.  You haven't benchmarked this case have you?
Thanks,
Jim
