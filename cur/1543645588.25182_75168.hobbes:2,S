Yes, with earlier versions of smptimers where global_bh_lock was
still being acquired to serialize with BHs, local timer clocks needed
to be spaced over a HZ to reduce contention. Archs that didn't space
the clocks perfromed poorly with smptimers as Anton found out with
ppc64 and had to change.

I will give it a spin.
