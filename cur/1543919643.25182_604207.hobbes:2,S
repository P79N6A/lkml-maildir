Yes sure, if you use nat.  But can you see how forcing people into splitting 
their rules across tables adds complexity.  And without ipt_REJECT patch, 
they can't even use REJECT in prerouting, which forces them to do some 
strange hacks.
IMHO, we should make things as easily configurable as possible, and as things 
stand right now, the filter-table is completely useless for 99% of 
use-cases.
Thanks!
