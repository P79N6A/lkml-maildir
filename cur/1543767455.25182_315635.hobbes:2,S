This is absolutely incompatible to no timer tick in IDLE - at least
my implementation that allows to keep all CPUs indepently in idle,
not require all CPUs to be idle to turn off the timers.
I had hoped that the hardware was clever enough to keep the
APIC timers working on SMP systems.
This is very unfortunate :-(( It means you will always 
waste a lot of power on a partially idle system, because
you cannot keep individual CPUs sleeping for a longer time.
I ran into the problem on AMD systems with C2 state - in 
my initial implementation there was only the APIC timer for
any time keeping because it is cheaper to reprogram and
there are a lot of chipsets which miss HPET - and on the
BP only the APIC timer was ticking at all, which did not 
work very well. This was avoided by using
PIT/HPET on the BP again. But on SMP systems there is not
much choice on the APs.

Huh? On contrary it completely kills really SMP aware dynamic tick
implementations.
I would really prefer to find some other way to solve this
Perhaps if we have enough timer sources in HPET we can use the 3-4
HPET timers on different CPUs. That would work on upto 4 socket
systems (sibling/dual core can be ignored I guess because for
power management purposes they dont really exist) 
This would be a problem for the few applications that use HPET
from user space for application timers, but I  think power saving
is more important than them or they can disable dynamic tick.
It is a big mess. I begin to envy the PPC guys who
actually have usable per CPU timers.
