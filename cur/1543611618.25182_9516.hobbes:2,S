In my experience, the HPT370 chipset likes corrupting harddrives. When I was
using it, I had the PCI Raid version and it kept corrupting my hard drives.
I tried updating the BIOS, but the bios program locked up and completly
killed my board. When I RMAed the board, the new BIOS was put on for me and
after that I ahven't had a single problem. Maybe you should try upgrading
the BIOS, but I don't know if you can for an onboard version.
