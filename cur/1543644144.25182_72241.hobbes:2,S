Hi,
	we use the generic HDLC module (by patch) in 2.4 with our FarSync
card.  I would be happy for it to be incorporated into the 2.4 Kernel.  We
don't use sethdlc, we have our own configuration utility.
	We are finding that some distro's are now incorporating the patch
anyway (Mandrake for example), and some of our customers are getting
confused when the patch doesn't install cleanly because it is already there.
Especially if the customer doesn't understand patch anyway and is just
following install instructions.
	What 2.4 version would you aim for?

Subject: 2.4 + generic HDLC update? Any ideas?
Hi,
The question is probably aimed mainly at people maintaining 2.4 Linux
and/or networking, but I'd like to see an opinion of other users/
developers as well.
What do you think about updating the 2.4 generic HDLC layer to the
newer 2.5 code?
Facts:
- it would break all sethdlc compatibility, users would be required to
  get 2.5 sethdlc.c and recompile it. There are even cosmetic sethdlc
  syntax changes and additions (sethdlc is a configuration tool).
- it would make it possible to support new boards like Cyclades PC300
  (not only this one).
- drivers which are in current 2.4 include Moxa C101 and RISCom/N2,
  which are older ISA cards. Most of their users currently use 2.5
  generic HDLC (a patch) with 2.4 kernels anyway.
- the other driver affected is DSCC4, but I know exactly nothing about
  it (a 2.5 version of it is, of course, available). What do you think,
  Francois?
The update, if any, wouldn't take place yet. I would expect it to happen
after some remaining questions regarding 2.5 code are resolved - chances
are there will be small changes to 2.5 generic HDLC interface first.
