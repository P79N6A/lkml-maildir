hi,
i using kernel 2.4.1. mkraid version 0.90.0
i build /dev/md0 raid-0 with hda5 and sda1. then i build /dev/md1 raid-1 
with /dev/md0 and sdb1.
it works fine.
BUT the resync takes a long time. i have a performance from 253K/sec. 
whats there wrong?
[root@mendocino <mailto:root@mendocino> /root]# cat /proc/mdstat
Personalities : [linear] [raid0] [raid1] [raid5]
read_ahead 1024 sectors
md0 : active raid1 md1[1] sdb1[0]
      8891712 blocks [2/2] [UU]
      [>....................]  resync =  0.0% (5572/8891712) 
finish=581.8min speed=253K/sec
md1 : active raid0 sda1[1] hda5[0]
      8891776 blocks 4k chunks
unused devices: <none>
if i build a raid-1 with sdb1 and hda5 i get:
Personalities : [linear] [raid0] [raid1] [raid5]
read_ahead 1024 sectors
md0 : active raid1 sdb1[1] hda5[0]
      4449920 blocks [2/2] [UU]
      [>....................]  resync =  0.4% (21952/4449920) 
finish=10.0min speed=7317K/sec
unused devices: <none>
i get the same speer also with sda1 and sdb1.
any ideas?
i will mount the raid-10 (or 01???) as "/". but the autodetection 
doesn't work corect. the partitions are all "Linux raid autodetect". the 
raid-0 starts fine. if he tries to start the raid-1 the dev md0 will not 
integrated in the array. must i start a ramdisk, and starting there 
manuell the raid-1? if i change md1 and md0 it's the same.
