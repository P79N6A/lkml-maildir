You mean this patch?
James Bottomley:
      [SCSI] Consolidate REQ_BLOCK_PC handling path (fix ipod panic)
This fixes an oops with data direction because sbp2 was not checking
enough itself.
I seriously doubt this will fix the issue being reported. Changing the
blk request to a READ did not fix the problem. The problem was only
fixed by sending the extra two commands. The direction was just a side
issue.
Is there a problem with sending the commands? If they don't bother
unaffected devices, but it does fix a large number of other devices,
what's the problem?
