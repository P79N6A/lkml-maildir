Yep, thanks.

I don't know what you mean by that.  It is still used...

It seems that anon dentries can now have children (I think someone
explained that too me - shrink_dcache_for_umount certainly suggests
it).
Also, in this context we cannot be sure that all dentries can be
freed.  This is being called a remount time remember, and some stuff
might still be in use.
We probably need to move the s_anon list to a temporary list and
repeatedly:
  move the top entry back to s_anon and call shrink_dcache_parent
 on it.
Needs more thought.
