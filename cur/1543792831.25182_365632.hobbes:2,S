If the old sharp driver had even a _chance_ of working, then you
presumably have four 8-bit flash chips laid out on a 32-bit bus, and
those chips are compatible with the Intel command set.
You can CONFIG_MTD_JEDECPROBE, and you want CONFIG_MTD_MAP_BANK_WIDTH=4,
CONFIG_MTD_CFI_I4, CONFIG_MTD_CFI_INTELEXT.
Check that your chips are listed in the table in jedec_probe.c and turn
on all the debugging in jedec_probe.c
