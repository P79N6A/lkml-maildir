I would vote for sym_2 replacement. I have bug 647 that fails on
sym53c8xx but works on sym_2. The bug still has a rmmod problem which
maybe cleaned up with the cleanups in scsi-misc.

I have the following not covered by your list above
qlogicisp (isp1020) - Convert to new eh and other issues. Could be
covered by feral driver, but status unclear of inclusion of feral.
Bug 140.
iph5526.c - Compile failure. Bug 201.
ini9100u.c - DMA-mapping conversion. Bug 213.
tmscsim.c - Compile failure. Bug 219.
AM53C974.c - Compile failure Bug 220.
An issue on fixing some of these is that lack of hardware,
documentation, or maintainer makes verification beyond compile difficult
(and just compile testing could lead to hidden data issues).
