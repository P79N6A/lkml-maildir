FYI: My situation is a VIA Epia EN12000 with a TranquilPC dual PCI riser
where only the Device Number can be changed.
The kernel sees the two DVB cards in there as:
saa7146: register extension 'budget_av'.
ACPI: PCI Interrupt 0000:00:13.0[A] -> GSI 16 (level, low) -> IRQ 16
saa7146: found saa7146 @ mem f8c3e000 (revision 1, irq 16) (0x153b,0x1157).
saa7146 (0): dma buffer size 192512
DVB: registering new adapter (Terratec Cinergy 1200 DVB-T).
adapter failed MAC signature check
encoded MAC from EEPROM was
ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
KNC1-0: MAC addr = 00:0a:ac:01:d6:87
DVB: registering frontend 0 (Philips TDA10046H DVB-T)...
budget-av: ci interface initialised.
ACPI: PCI Interrupt 0000:00:14.0[A] -> GSI 17 (level, low) -> IRQ 20
saa7146: found saa7146 @ mem f8cb2000 (revision 1, irq 20) (0x153b,0x1155).
saa7146 (1): dma buffer size 192512
DVB: registering new adapter (TerraTec Cinergy 1200 DVB-S).
adapter failed MAC signature check
encoded MAC from EEPROM was
ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
sd 0:0:0:0: Attached scsi generic sg0 type 0
KNC1-1: MAC addr = 00:0a:ac:12:93:8d
DVB: registering frontend 1 (ST STV0299 DVB-S)...
budget-av: ci interface initialised.
So IRQ 16 and 20. But when using the stock 2.6.20 kernel there is no
communication with the DVB-T card (the frontend), so there is no
/dev/dvb/* entry. This points to an IRQ problem.
How can I find out the actual IRQ that the card is using?
If it is different from what Linux thinks: how do I tell Linux?

I set the BIOS for 'PnP OS installed'. Should I change that?

Thanks for your response!
Kind regards,
