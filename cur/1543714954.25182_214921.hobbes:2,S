  I've noticed a behaviour today very similar to mentioned in previous report
  (on 14   Apr 2004) except for message from BUG() (kernel 2.6.5-aa5) i.e.
  system remained accessible but procps(ps,pkill) appears to be locked and
  Sysrq-T is similar to previous one - some of apache2 & all of procps 
  have been blocked.
  Here is a traces:
