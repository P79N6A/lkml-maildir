Due to my ignorance of/missing understanding of branches in git one
patch were missing in the origin branch.
It was in the master branch instead - so I have pulled in the master
branch in the origin branch and updated the kbuild repository.
It is following patch:
Jan-Benedict Glaw
	kbuild: tar-pkg with out-out-tree building
	Sam
