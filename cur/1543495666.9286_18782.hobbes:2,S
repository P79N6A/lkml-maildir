i don't think you want to be holding spin-locks across
a put_user/copy_from_user etc.  put_user et al can page
fault and go to sleep holding the spin lock.  this can
then deadlock the system if other processes comes along
and contend for the same lock.  if you are desperate for
parallel performance in this area you will need to implement
reader-writer semaphores.
