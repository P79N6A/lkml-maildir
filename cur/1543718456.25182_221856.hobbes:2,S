One thing I *do* want to do, is instead of explicit homenodes, is to take
into account the per-node RSS of processes when doing my migration decisions.
That gives us a kind of dynamic homenode. I have the per-node RSS code in
my tree already from someone (Matt?), but we haven't used it.  Of course,
this throws off the O(1)-ness of balancing decisions, but as long as we
cap the number we look at, and only do it for cross-node rebalance migrates
(we don't need it for exec), I really don't care ;-)
