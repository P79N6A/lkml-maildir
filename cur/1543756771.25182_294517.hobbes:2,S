Subject: [PATCH] tone down pci=routeirq message
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/2/11/202

Tone down the message about using "pci=routeirq".  I do still get
a few reports, but most are now prompted just by the fact that
my email address appears in dmesg in an "error-type" message.
