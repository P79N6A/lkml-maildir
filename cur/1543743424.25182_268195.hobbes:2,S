Any more hints how to trigger that?  I can't reproduce that on my
machines, neither with xawtv nor tvtime.
Any change when setting the triton=1 or vsfx=1 insmod options (probably
not, but who knows ...)?

Hmm, I somehow miss either buffer_release or vbi_buffer_release here.
Do you have KALLSYMS enabled?  Does tvtime use video only or vbi as
well?
Can you try to enable debug=1 for the video-buf module?
