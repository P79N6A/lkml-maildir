That doesn't answer my question.
See, first we need to work out whether we have a problem.  If we do this,
then we can then have a think about what to do about it.
I tried to convince the 2006 KS attendees that we have a problem and I
resoundingly failed.  People seemed to think that we're doing OK.
But it appears that data such as this contradicts that belief.
This is not a minor matter.  If the kernel _is_ slowly deteriorating then
this won't become readily apparent until it has been happening for a number
of years.  By that stage there will be so much work to do to get us back to
an acceptable level that it will take a huge effort.  And it will take a
long time after that for the kerel to get its reputation back.
So it is important that we catch deterioration *early* if it is happening.
