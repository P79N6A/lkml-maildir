Sorry, but this doesn't make any sense.  There is no need to put every
feature in the XFS ioctls in the syscalls.  The XFS ioctls will need to
be supported forever anyway - as I suggested before they really should
be moved to generic code.
What needs to be supported is what makes sense as an interface.
A punch a hole interface does make sense, but trying to hack this into
a preallocation system call is just madness.  We're not IRIX or windows
that fit things into random subcall just because there was some space
left to squeeze them in.

HSMs needs this basically for every system call, which screams for an
open flag like O_INVISIBLE anyway.  Adding this in a generic way is
a good idea, but hacking bits and pieces that won't fit into the global
design is completely wrong.
