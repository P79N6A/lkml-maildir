Reason unknown. I expect some statement here.

Possibly no one had one? I have some boxes running prettily on LinuxBIOS, 
can't imagine why it isn't merged into 2.5. But I can't imagine what's 
speaking against KBuild-2.5 either. I can speak it, I love it.

Nobody seemed to be interested in this toolkit. The (s|l)trace toolkit and 
kdb seemed to be sufficient for the most developers. (I don't whine here 
either.)

Seems they got lost.
