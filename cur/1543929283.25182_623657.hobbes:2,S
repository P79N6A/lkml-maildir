Amen. I still have to see a single rational argument against this 
debugging feature - and tons of arguments were listed in favor of it. So 
let's just try and see what happens.

we could lower that limit to 1 per bootup - if they become annoying. 
There's lots of flexibility in the code. Really, we should have done 
this 10 years ago - it would have literally saved me many days of 
debugging time combined, and i really have experience in identifying 
such bad tasks. (and it would have sped up debugging in countless number 
of instances when users were met with an uninterruptible task.)
