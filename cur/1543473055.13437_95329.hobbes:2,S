I have the defrag on already.
The mtu/mru 1500 causes the problem to go away.
Given that this is a bad wrong problematic kludge, where should I be
looking to fix this *without* changing my mtu/mru from 296 to 1500?
Is there a problem with the defrag, where an interaction with diald
between the sl0 and ppp0 causes the always-defrag to not defrag?
Changing my MTU/MRU from 296 to 1500 causes many other problems, I have to
find another approach to this...
