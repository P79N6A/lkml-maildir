I have partial lists at this point.  I confess to not having made
much progress porting my memory-barrier torture tests to the relevant
architectures over the past few weeks (handling the lack of synchronized
lightweight fine-grained timers being the current obstacle), but will
let people know once I have gotten the tests working on the machines
that I have access to.
I don't have access to SMP Alpha or ARM machines (or UP either, for that
matter), so won't be able to test those.
						Thanx, Paul
