Dual what Xeon? I presume a P4 thing. Can you cat /proc/interrupts? 
Are you using the irq_balance code? If so, I think you'll only use 
1 cpu to process all the interrupts from each gigabit card. Not that 
you have much choice, since Intel broke the P4's interrupt routing.
Which of the e1000 modules settings did you play with? tx_delay
and rx_delay? What rev of the e1000 chipset?
