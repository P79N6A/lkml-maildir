I don't understand laws.
What you guys think about this ?
Labor Code section 2870 of the State of California:
"Any provision in an employment agreement which provides that an employee 
shall assign or offer to assign any of his or her rights in an invention 
to his or her employer shall not apply to an inventory that the employee 
developed entirely on his or her own time without using the employer's 
equipment, supplies, facilities, or trade secret information..."
