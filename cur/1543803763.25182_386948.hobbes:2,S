Subject: [PATCH 0/4] compact call trace
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/1/17/43

These patches will:
- break the various custom oops-parsers which people have written themselves.
- use common call trace format on x86-64.
- change offset format from hexadecimal to decimal in print_symbol()
- delete symbolsize in call trace in print_symbol().
- print system_utsname.version in oops so that we can doing a
  double check that the oops is matching the vmlinux we're looking at.
Example output:
o Currently we get the following call trace
i386: [<f0ad4c51>] kjournald+0x18c/0x207 [jbd]
x86-64: <ffffffffa008ef6c>{:jbd:kjournald+1030}
o After applied these patches.
i386: [<f0ad4c51>] kjournald+396 [jbd]
x86-64: <ffffffffa008ef6c> kjournald+1030 [jbd]
