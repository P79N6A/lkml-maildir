	Hello,
	After downloading latest test3-pre5 I've tried to compile it, but
I get some errors (warnings that became errors with -Werror) during
compiling and real errors while linking. It seems that there are
duplicated symbols both in net/network.o and drivers/net/net.o(8390.o).
	I'm compiling support for an hp-plus ethernet (that's old :-) and
the linker complain about duplicated ksymbtab_* symbols. If anybody wants
I could send more detailed information.
	Thanks, 
	- german
