doesn't matter, they are likly to be found on dedicated servers where
the flexibility of modules is not needed and the slight performance
advantage is desired.
making everything modular is fine for desktops/laptops but why should
dedicated servers pay the price?

I don't want autoconfig to detect my remote machines I want to specify
them directly. (there are likly to be things on the motherboards of
machines that I don't want to compile into the kernel, sound cards for
servers are one example, video drivers are another, and USB is a third)
autoconfig is supposed to be an option, not the only way to compile a
kernel (or are you saying that you don't want to be able to use your 1.2G
athlon to build the kernel for your 486?)
