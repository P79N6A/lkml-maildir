Hello all,
I think there is a race in the RPC code in 2.4.20, related to timeout
and congestion window handling.
The problem code is in net/sunrpc/xprt.c:
static void
xprt_timer(struct rpc_task *task)
{       
        struct rpc_rqst *req = task->tk_rqstp;
        struct rpc_xprt *xprt = req->rq_xprt;
        spin_lock(&xprt->sock_lock);
        if (req->rq_received)
                goto out;
        if (!xprt->nocong) {
                if (xprt_expbackoff(task, req)) {
                        rpc_add_timer(task, xprt_timer);
                        goto out_unlock;
                }
                rpc_inc_timeo(&task->tk_client->cl_rtt);
                xprt_adjust_cwnd(req->rq_xprt, -ETIMEDOUT);
        }
        req->rq_nresend++;
The call to xprt_adjust_cwnd is the problem - I experienced a panic
(null pointer dereference) in 
static void
xprt_adjust_cwnd(struct rpc_xprt *xprt, int result)
{
        unsigned long   cwnd;
        cwnd = xprt->cwnd;
        if (result >= 0 && cwnd <= xprt->cong) {
Here it is the "cwnd = xprt->cwnd" that causes the panic. xprt was 0.
This means, in the xprt_timer code, that req->rq_xprt must have been 0.
I guess this can happen because of the sequence:
 xprt = req->rq_xprt;
 spin_lock(&xprt->sock_lock);
...
 xprt_adjust_cwnd(req->rq_xprt);
We don't know whether req has been modified between the assignment and
the spin_lock.
Attached is a patch to solve the problem - please comment.
It does not solve the other potential (?) problem with:
 xprt = req->rq_xprt;
 spin_lock(&xprt->sock_lock);
 ...
                if (xprt_expbackoff(task, req)) {
 ...
Any suggestions to that one?
I cannot test whether my patch solve the problem, because this panic has
happened once on a *heavily* loaded box which has run 2.4.20 ever since
it came out.  The race is extremely rare.  It is an SMP box by the way.
Thanks a lot to "baldrick" on kernel-newbies for the help!
