I think it would be pretty easy to do.  Since mlock(2) operates on the 
calling processes vma tree you'd need an interface to the kernel that 
let you specify a child process and an address range to lock.  Then in 
the kernel you'd need to translate the pid into task struct and 
replicate the functionality of sys_mlock without the assumption that 
current points to the task that you're modifying.  Sounds like something 
you could do pretty easy with a proc file in fact.
