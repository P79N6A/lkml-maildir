Let me get this straight.  The proposal is to expose cluster membership as a 
virtual filesystem and use that as the primary membership interface?  So 
that, e.g., a server on the cluster does a getdents to find out what nodes 
are in the cluster or uses inotify to learn about membership changes, 
instead of subscribing for and receiving membership events directly from 
the cluster membership manager?
Or what is this about, just providing a nice friendly view of the cluster to 
the administrator, not intended to be used by cluster infrastructure 
components?
Regards,
Daniel
