in general (except of course those netdev folks that are interested in 
-rt+networking performance matters) i'd suggest we analyze this in an 
-rt specific way - netdev shouldnt have to bother about this.

one thing to check would be whether both kernels use the same 
clocksource, via:
 cat /sys/devices/system/clocksource/clocksource0/current_clocksource
but at first sight there's no clocksource related overhead in the 
oprofile.
