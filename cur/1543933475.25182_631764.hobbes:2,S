Using v2.6.24-rc6-125-g5356f66, code such as this:
	if (is_file)	/* dirs can be unlinked but chdir'ed to */
		err = -ESTALE;
produces this false checkpatch error:
	foo.c:947: ERROR: trailing statements should be on next line
I think comments such as the above should be allowed (plus a comment isn't a
statement).  It's often very useful to put them right on the affected line.
Thanks,
Erez.
