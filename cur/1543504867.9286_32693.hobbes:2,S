I just got a crash while using cdparanoia (a cd ripper) on my PPro 180, 
running 2.2.10.
Here is what I could transcribe (manually):
Call trace: [<c012daee>] [<c012de34>] [c012e1a5>] [<c0109dd0>]
Unable to handle NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 00000004
current->tss.cr3= 00101000, %cr3=00101000
*pde=00000000
oops: 0002
CPU 0
EIP 0010 [<c0121d75>]
EFLAGS: 00010046
eax: c02c89c0   ebx: 00001eec   ecx: ffffffff   edx: 00000000
esi: 00003dd8   edi: c021394c   ebp: 00000202   esp: c009ddfc

Process init (pid: 1, process nr: 1, stackpage = c009d000
...
Here's my configuration:
PPro 180 Mhz / 64 MB
hda: Western Digital 3.2 GB (not mounted at time of crash)
hdb: Mitsumi CD-R 8/4 under scsi emulation on /dev/scd0 (thhis is the 
            cdrom I was using cdparanoia on when the crash happened)
hdc: Quantum Fireball 13 GB (where / is)
hdd: Panasonic 4x cdrom under scsi emulation on /dev/scd1 (don't know if 
            it was mounted)
two PCI NE2000 cards (doing ip forwarding)
1 SB 16 ISA PnP
1 SB PCI 64
Before the crash, the driver has been acting a bit strangely (work
sometimes, sometimes doesn't). The crash occured exactly at the time I
tried to stop (^C) cdparanoia. Also, I have had other problems on this
machine which *might* be related: 
1) What seems to be huge memory leaks in the kernel (I kill everything 
(X, nfs, smb, ...), but the system is still using ~30 Meg more memory 
(excluding cached data) than at boot and my system can hardly do 
anything). It happened twice under 2.2.9, it's too soon to know if 2.2.10 
fixed it.
2) I've found the following oops in a log (2.2.9):
Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address 001bd016
current->tss.cr3 = 03790000, %cr3 = 03790000
*pde = 00000000
Oops: 0002
CPU:    0
EIP:    0010:[opl3:opl3_detect_R67481767+-18308987/5620]

Process ld (pid: 21339, process nr: 96, stackpage=c3d25000)
If you need more info, just tell me. Or if you think of anything I can 
try to find (reproduce) the bug.
