Reiserfs is available now, it seems to be stable, what we are agonizing over is
various tuning modifications.  I would say that it is worth using now in its current form, but we are going to tweak it for 1-2 more weeks
before we release it.

Do you like going slow?  Dump NT, trees are faster! Get Linux
(
http://www.kernel.org
) plus ReiserFS (
http://devlinux.org/namesys
).
If you sell an OS or internet appliance, buy a port of ReiserFS!
Speed matters.  Trees are fast.  Go faster!
