I think this sort of thing has been discussed before.  I get the 
impression that xmms blocks on the X server, so when some app grabs the 
server, then xmms gets blocked and stops.  I don't know why the display 
code is not in a separate thread from the audio code; although maybe 
they are but they interact somehow that causes this.
