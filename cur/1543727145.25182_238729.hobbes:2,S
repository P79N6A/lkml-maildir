Well, the license is an "or", so you're free to create derived works
under either or both licenses as you prefer.
But I don't even see why it's an issue; every source I've ever seen
seems to agree that the two are compatible, so you're always free to
relicense under 3-clause BSD under BSD or GPL anyway.  So, unless I'm
missing something, the "or GPL" probably doesn't do anything more than
make explicit something that was allowed already.
