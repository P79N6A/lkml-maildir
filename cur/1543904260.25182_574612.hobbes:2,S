Disk sizes seem to increase more rapidly that the ability to read them
quickly.  Fortunately the processing power increase greatly too.
It may be a good idea to spend more CPU cycles to better decide how the
VM should juggle with this data. We've got to keep those multi-cores cpu
busy.

Well I might try a few things along the way.
But I prefer the thorough approach versus tinkering... 
- Read all research, check competition
- Build test virtual machines, with benchmarks and typical workloads
- Add (or use) some instrumentation to the pagecache
- Code a simulator
- Try all algorithms, tune them
This is way overkill for a part-time hobby.
If we don't see much work on this area it's surely because it's really
not a problem anymore for most workloads. Database have their own cache
management and disk scheduling, file servers just add more ram or
processors, etc.

Will test.
