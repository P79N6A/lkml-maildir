Subject: unresolved symbols in module dependencies

i have compiled a new kernel (2.2.12-20) and have many things compiled as 
modules.  I did the make modules; make modules-install thing just fine.
I should also say that i am porting a pcmcia card driver from 2.0.x to 
2.2.x.
Here is the (relevant) output of depmod -ae 2.2.12-20
/lib/modules/2.2.12-20/pcmcia/cac32_cs.o: unresolved symbol(s)
        __pollwait
HOW IN THE HECK do i fix this?  In fact the output depmod -ae 2.2.12-20 
reveals many many more unresolved symbols.... but i am primarily interested 
in fixing the one i specified. That module is the pcmcia card driver i am 
porting...
thank you all for any help, i am desperate here.
