Replying to myself:
Ok, I figured it out. It's a definitely a pam problem. I fetched latest 
pam rpm from RH RawHide and picked up their sigchld patch, applied it to 
mandrake cookers's latest pam package, rebuilt, et voila'. All is well 
again, it doesnt hang anymore. I think the bug in bugzilla can be closed 
now. I'm attaching the patch to pam 0.77, if anyone wants to give it a 
spin. Also, should anyone from mandrake is reading this, it'd be 
adviseable to apply it to the official package. I'll ping them anyway, to 
let them know of this.
Thanks for the input, everyone.
