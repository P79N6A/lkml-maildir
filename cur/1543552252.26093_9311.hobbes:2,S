That pretty much answers the question right there IMHO.  This is
an FAQ.

Not by turning it into a microkernel.  Suggesting it is nothing
more than religious CS BS.

[Mike A. Harris Linux tip #1 - 50 line mode]
Is the 80x25 line screen too small for you?  If you want more screen real
estate, you can set 50 column mode by editing your /etc/lilo.conf file, and 
adding a new line with "vga=ext" to the global section near the top.  Save
and exit, then run "lilo".  Next time you boot, you'll have a nice big 80x50 
screen.
