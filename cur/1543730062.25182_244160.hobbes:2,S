wli is a self-contained corner case.

LTP would be appropriate.  If it is possible to come up with a suitably
encapsulated testcase I'm sure they'd take (and integrate) the code.

Well, we've just released 2.6.8, so the answer to your question is "right
now".
It seems that the release cycle has stretched from ~4 weeks out to ~6
weeks or more.  But some of that increase could be due to summer and OLS.

As soon as it's ready.
Seriously, don't let hypothetical kernel bureaucracy hold you back - write
the code, get it into -mm.  I'll look after it for as long as we think is
appropriate, then it goes in.  As long as it doesn't break existing stuff.
