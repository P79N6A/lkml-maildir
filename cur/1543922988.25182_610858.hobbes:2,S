Hi Markus.
Please do not edit cc: and to: - it is easy to miss out a mail on lkml.

From the above we can see that two make's are running in parallel here
where only one should run.
I have seen this before but only in cases where you specified several targets
on the make commandline - which you do not do in the make invocation.
Just to check it you could do a:
$(warning CMD=$(MAKECMDFLAGS)) around the place where SUBARCH is assigned in the
top-level Makefile.
Does the issue by any chance go away if you refrain from the
command && command && command && command && command && command
way of doing things?
The shell _shall_ serialize it - but..

If you look at the top-level Makefile you will see:
        @echo '  Using $(srctree) as source for kernel'
        $(Q)if [ -f $(srctree)/.config -o -d $(srctree)/include/config ]; then \
                echo "  $(srctree) is not clean, please run 'make mrproper'";\
                echo "  in the '$(srctree)' directory.";\
                /bin/false; \
        fi;
So you either a .config file or the config directory. Older kernels also tested
that the asm symlink in include/ was not present.
You should check that all these indeed are gone when you do "make mrproper" - you
can have been hit by a privilige issue too. But that should not be the case if
you copied the full tree to another place (and of course did not use cp -a).
You did this - yes? And the result?

If you now say this is a SUSE specific problem then I suggest asking SUSE for help.
At least I have not built a distribution kernel the last year or more - and I
do not follow what kind of patches they apply.
