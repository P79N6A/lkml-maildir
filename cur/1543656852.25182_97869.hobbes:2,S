Subject: 2.4.20: ideN=... option stopped working

I have an inherited ancient PC with a weird IDE configuration that
requires ide1=0x170,0x376,14 specified on the kernel command line in
order to boot.  This worked fine in 2.4.18 but not in 2.4.20.  I
haven't checked 2.4.19.
After some investigation I found the relevant change and tried
reverting it.  The resulting kernel works for me.  Here's the diff:

During my investigation I added some printk calls which make it
clearer what ide_setup objects to when it jumps to bad_option.
Perhaps these would be of more general use, diff below.
