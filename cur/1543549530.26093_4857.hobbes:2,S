Yes, it could be two config options:
  bzImage includes System map 
  bzImage includes System config
But actually we're not talking about a kernel build option at all,
we're just talking about cat'ing one or two gzip files onto the end of
bzImage, and so the only reason for making it a config option would be
for taking care of really clueless people like me who don't know
that.  Otherwise it would just be a little script or perhaps an option
on 'make install'.
