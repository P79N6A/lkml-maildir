yes, most of the time, the warning scares people unnecessarily.
but if the machine is seeing lots of CRC failures, there should 
definitely be some prominent messages.  perhaps something simple
like producing a warning if more than a few of recent IOs
have had CRC problems:
int crcState = 0;
on successful IO: 
	crcState >>= 1;
on CRC failure: 
	if (crcState)
		printk("dang, CRC failed on hda, see 
http://whatever
");
	crcState = 1 << 10;
so if >10 IOs succeed between CRC failures, there's no warning.
(uh, I guess that would actually be 9, since presumably the retry
would succeed...)  keeping a global count of CRC failures would be
kind of nice, too.
