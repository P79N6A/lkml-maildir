x86-64 has the same problem. It always rebuilds arch/x86_64/ia32/vsyscall32.so,
no matter if it has changed or not. I have not figured out why it does that.
vsyscall.S is an assembly file which depends on asm/offset.h, which 
is regenerated each build. But the regeneration is written in a way to 
not trigger rebuilds when nothing has changed. That works for everything
else, just apparently not for the vsyscall.S file.
