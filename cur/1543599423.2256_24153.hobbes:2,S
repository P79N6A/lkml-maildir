The intel driver is generally fast and stable, but I'm sure
it's not perfect.  Have you tried the eepro100 driver for
this NIC?
The fact that the eepro100 complains about the lockup bug,
and the e100 doesn't, probably does not mean the e100 doesn't
work around the bug too:  Intel is just more quiet about it's
hardware bugs :)
I'm not sure it will help you, but I have a listing of all the
cards I've tried (recently).  There is a 2-port Intel based NIC
on there (The Compaq one) but it may not be your particular version.
It did work very well for me.
Here's my ethernet NIC listing page:

At any rate, you should probably send this question off to the
eepro100@scyld.com mailing list, especially if you have problems
with the eepro100 driver...
Enjoy,
Ben
