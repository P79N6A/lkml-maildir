I've used the 2.2 kernels shipped with Red Hat 7.0 and 7.1, briefly. This 
box has been running various 2.4 kernels since 2.4.0-test10, and is now 
running the Red Hat 7.2 release kernel. None of them have had any ISDN 
problems.

Why rebuild? An SMP kernel is shipped, with matching modules etc.

Difficult to say, without actually having seen the error you're getting. 
Try turning CONFIG_MODVERSIONS off and rebuilding both kernel and modules, 
for a start.
