I disabled eepro100 support completely and the problem is still
there. What I also noticed is that with highmem-PAE enabled I get BUG in
page_alloc.c at line 221 so it is probably a VM problem recently
introduced (hence cc'd Rik).
I will continue to narrow down by removing some things (like mtrr) from
the equation. Rik, the problem is that when one enables PAE (or just
highmem-4G) support on a 4-way 6G RAM machine becomes 38-40 times slower.

Tigran
