    Too late, I'm afraid.
    The de facto standard names are already known to the kernel (cf:
    init/main.c::name_to_kdev_t(), just for an example) and it is
    somewhat silly to have this one place spit out a magic code after
    the kernel has just finished telling you (for example)
    sda : READ CAPACITY failed.
    sda : status = 1, message = 00, host = 0, driver = 28 
    sda : extended sense code = 2 
    sda : block size assumed to be 512 bytes, disk size 1GB.  
    Partition check:
     sda:scsidisk I/O error: dev 08:00, sector 0
      unable to read partition table
     hda: hda1 hda2 hda3

                   \/                 coherence in error messages.
