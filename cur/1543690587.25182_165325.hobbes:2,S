Didn't we just have this discussion? ;-) RAID5 benchmarks all available
code and then uses SSE2 or whatever because it doesn't plunk the
registers or cache or something... sorry, the details escape me, or the
sorry details escape me, or whatever.
BTW: I do agree with your point here, I'm using cryptoloop for some
stuff I'm doing, and while I never do enough disk i/o to care, this is a
good thing for the future. I'm using a PII-350, but next month I have to
add a P55C SMP machine, and will be doing much more crypto.
Thanks for asking for clarification, the patch looks better for it.
