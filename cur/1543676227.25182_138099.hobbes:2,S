Subject: [2.5.70] ext2 floppy corruption

With 2.5.70 and 2.5.66 (just tried those two), I see floppy corruption
when I attempt to copy a kernel file to a floppy formatted with ext2. 
Rebooting into 2.4.21rc7 and rerunning the copy seems to cure the
problem.
To reproduce:
mke2fs /dev/fd0
mount /dev/fd0 /a
cp -a /vmlinuz /a
umount /a
mount /a
md5sum /a/vmlinuz /vmlinuz
I get the wrong md5sum consistently from the floppy.  When attempting to
boot this kernel with grub, I get a "attempting to access data outside of
partition" error after it is loading for a little while.
If I mkdosfs on the same floppy and copy over the kernel, it seems to
work properly.
I will try to track this down further if nobody has any immediate ideas.
