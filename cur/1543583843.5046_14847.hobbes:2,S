What is the current version of ncpfs, and where can it be found?  The most
recent I could find (at www.ibiblio.org) was ncpfs-2.2.0 which dates back to May
1998, and I ran into the problem with select when trying to compile it on a
current system.  I got it to work by compiling it on an old 2.0.x box that I
haven't upgraded in several years, then moved it to my 2.4.x system.  It's been
working fine for several months, but I'd like to be able to compile it on a
current system without hacking the source.

Reasonable recent kernels should display ':UUUU' instead of unknown
characters on ncpfs. Of course it requires that codepage->unicode
translation table does not contain disallowed translations.

You are using some really old ncpfs.
