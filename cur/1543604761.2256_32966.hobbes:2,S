what's the question?  you just reformatted my results.
> If so, then 2.4.12 won on user, system and elapsed.  
of course: that's the point.  but elapsed is where the big difference is,
and that's what's interesting, since it reflects less dead time due to 
smarter/less swapping.

yes, of course: the bp6 is a dual, with cel/366's in this case.
I don't think SMPness is relevant here.

no, my statement is correct; I merely didn't give stats for Rik's VM.
