Is this on an alpha?  If not, then you can't do this: lseek() takes a
signed 32-bit arg which can only go up to 2G, unless you are on a 64-bit
machine.  On Intel, your test prog works fine for me.  On Alpha, it is
expected to fail at 17G (which is where the indirection blocks stop on a
1k blocksize filesystem).
