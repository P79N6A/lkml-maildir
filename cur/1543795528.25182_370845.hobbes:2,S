Gentleman,
Since the release of kernel 2.15-rc1-mm1 I can't compile the kernel 
anymore due to this issue while doing an make oldconfig.
When running make oldconfig I get this output:\
  HOSTCC  scripts/kconfig/zconf.tab.o
scripts/kconfig/zconf.tab.c: In function 'conf_parse':
scripts/kconfig/zconf.tab.c:1939: error: 'SYMBOL_CHECK_DONE' undeclared 
(first use in this function)
scripts/kconfig/zconf.tab.c:1939: error: (Each undeclared identifier is 
reported only once
scripts/kconfig/zconf.tab.c:1939: error: for each function it appears in.)
make[1]: *** [scripts/kconfig/zconf.tab.o] Error 1
When trying to compile the kernel using make but a non update .config 
file I get this output which might be related to the previous issue:
bash-2.05b$ make

I'm using gcc-4.0.2, and glibc-2.3.3
Thanks in advance for your help.
