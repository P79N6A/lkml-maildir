Ok, retried this with burnMMX on the "large" box, apparently the killer works in
some cases. (It killed the offending burnMMX processes after stalling for a
minute or two, but I guess I can't blame the scheduler when it hast to handle
more than 1000 running processes).
Still, the situation isn't favorable with the other workloads which lead to 
lockups.
