I think most people will find the long freeze worth avoiding, thanks for 
making it easily adjustable. As I found out when I was evaluating sorts 
and human interfaces that users would rather use a slower sort which 
didn't have a "jackpot case" than one which was 30% faster but linear in 
response. This was for 1-2sec typical response.
Just my guess.
