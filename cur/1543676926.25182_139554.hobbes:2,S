Do you want to install a magic crystal ball in the kernel? :-)
For select to properly block on write it has to know the destination of
the write.  For unconnected sockets you haven't told the destination.
There's know way for the kernel to know at select time which receiver
to check for free space.
You were talking about a "send queue".  I guess you think it should
work like: if destination has enough room move data to destination
else queue it in the send queue.  Then select would check whether the
*send queue* has enough space for another packet.  But that would mean
that a single slow receiver would block all others.  I.e. /tmp/a is
slow; you fill the queue; select blocks even when you actually want to
send to /tmp/b which has plenty of space.
Ciao, ET.
