Well, that's not much different from the case where there _are_ usable
bits but they are all near the end of the bitmap.  And that's common
enough as you fill up a block group with small files, for example.  Once
the bg becomes nearly full, new file opens-for-write will still try to
allocate in that bg (because that's where the inode was allocated), but
as it's a new fd we have no prior knowledge of _where_ in the bh to
allocate, and we'll have to walk it to the end to find any free space. 
This is the access pattern I'd expect of (for example) "tar xvjf
linux-2.6.12.tar.bz2", not exactly a rare case.

Not in this case, because it's the "home" of the file in question, and
skipping to another bg would just leave useful space empty --- and that
leads to fragmentation.

No, I'm suggesting that if we need the write lock for tree updates, we
may still be able to get away with just a read lock when updating an
individual window.  If all we're doing is winding the window forwards a
bit, that's not actually changing the structure of the tree.

Adding a new window will need the write lock, always.  But with the read
lock, we can still check the neighbouring windows (the structure is
pinned so those remain valid), so advancing a window with just that lock
can still be done without risking overlapping the next window.
