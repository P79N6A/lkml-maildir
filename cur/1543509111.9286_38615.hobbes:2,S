Subject: Please help!  I can't seem to get SYSRQ to work.  I've read the docs and  compiled the kernel with Kernel Debugging turned on.

Hi,
Sorry if this at all off-topic.
I am getting hard lockups while downloading files over a PCMCIA modem
connection.
As far as I can tell, all I/O is frozen (mouse pointer stops moving,
CTRL-ALT-DEL
doesn't cause my system to shut down, etc.).  I am forced to power cycle
the machine.
I have read sysrq.txt and followed the instructions for checking 
the SYSRQ key mapping.  showkey gives output like this for "ALT-SYSRQ-R" 
and "F12-R":
ALT-SYSRQ-R
0x38 0x54 0x13
0xd4 0x93 0xb8
F12-R
0x13 0x58
0x93 0xd8
0x58 0x13
0xd8 0x93
The annoying thing is that I have been unable to verify that 
the SYSRQ stuff is working.  I have tried getting memory info
to be dumped to the console, with no success.  After ALT-SYSRQ-M
failed, I tried remapping SYSRQ to F12 in keyboard.h.  That didn't
work either.
Please, if you have any idea what I'm doing wrong, please let me
know.  I am really frustrated that I have been unable to collect
ANY information about what is causing my kernel to lock up.
Thanks a million!
	Miles
