You mean we could pass the iocb as a parameter all the way down 
for the async versions of the ops and do_sync_op() could just do 
a wait_for_sync_iocb() ?  
That was what I'd originally intended to do.
But then I experimented with the current->iocb alternative
because:
1. I wasn't sure how much API fixing, we could do at this stage.
   (it is after all pretty late in the 2.5 cycle) 
   If you notice I've been trying to tread very carefully in
   terms of the modifications to interfaces, especially anything
   that requires changes to all filesystems.
2. I wanted to quickly have something we could play with and run 
   performance tests on, with minimal changes/impact on existing
   code paths and sync i/o operations. Additionally current->iocb 
   gave me an simple way to detect blocking operations (schedules) 
   during aio, no matter how deep a subroutine we are in. (I have
   been using those indicators to prioritize which blocking 
   points to tackle)
3. After a first pass of trying to use retries for sync ops 
   as well, it seemed like being able to continue from a blocking 
   point directly as we do today would be more efficient (In 
   this case, we do care more about latency than we do for async 
   ops). So that meant a switch between return -EIOCBQUEUED and 
   blocking depending on whether this was an async or sync
   context. I could do that with an is_sync_iocb() check as 
   well (vs current->iocb), but even that would be changing 
   semantics. 
So if (1) is sorted out, i.e. we still have the opportunity 
to alter some APIs, then we could do it that way.
Do we ?
