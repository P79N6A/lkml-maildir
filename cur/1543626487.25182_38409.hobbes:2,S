Hi,
id like to thank you for maintaining this driver..
i have a 3com 3c905 and im using 3c59x.c driver to run it in my linux
machine. it is connected to a hub on a network with 7 nodes. it seems like
one of the hosts on my network has a duplex problem (as is described in
vortex.txt). the problem i'm having is that the driver does a lot of
kernel messages for this error even though my debug is set to the default.
i've looked at the code and the problem seems to be due to a small typo:
this code segment begins at line 1826:
------------------------------------------------
       if (status & TxComplete) {                      /* Really "TxError" for us. */
                tx_status = inb(ioaddr + TxStatus);
                /* Presumably a tx-timeout. We must merely re-enable. */
                if (vortex_debug > 2
                        || (tx_status != 0x88 && vortex_debug > 0)) {
                        printk(KERN_ERR "%s: Transmit error, Tx status register %2.2x.\n",
                                   dev->name, tx_status);
                        if (tx_status == 0x82) {
                                printk(KERN_ERR "Probably a duplex mismatch.  See "
                                                "Documentation/networking/vortex.txt\n");
                        }
                        dump_tx_ring(dev);
-------------------------------------------------
i believe the problem resides when it tests for the debug level:
	          if (vortex_debug > 2
                        || (tx_status != 0x88 && vortex_debug > 0)) {
the || operator should be a && because we only want to print the error
message if debug is greater than 2 and the transmit status is not what it
should be.
thanks a lot
