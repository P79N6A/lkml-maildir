that's the case : well I said no resource desalocation it was for the 
motherboard. We haven't other choice : if we disable them, they won't be 
unusable until an other driver ask the motherboard to activate them.
And for the kbd and mouse these resources are always activated on 
motherboard : the systems that don't support dynamic allocation should 
be able to use them, so with "pnp_can_disable(dev) = 0", we let the 
resources like they were before.
Note also if there weren't activate on boot, the acpi driver couldn't 
find them, because it don't know how to allocate a resource...

And what happen if you use irq12 for an other stuff and you plug your 
mouse and try to use it. The motherboard hasn't desalocated the irq12 
for mouse, so there will be a big conflict...

well that less that 400 between i8042 with pnp support and without.
And why not "__init" init code, "__devinit" probe, "__devinitdata" 
array, "__exit" exit ?
And if you are sure that hotpluging is not possible for i8042, then you 
could even __init the probe and array since there will be not used 
again, but that more ugly than the pnp_can_disable(dev) hack ;)
