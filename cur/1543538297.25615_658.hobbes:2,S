That is possible..  I do not have the card, nor have I seen
it.  Someone else has one and figures they can plug IDE hard
disks into it.  I doubted that it was an IDE interface to begin
with, but... who's to argue with someone that KNOWS that it
is.  I figured I'd find out anyway before his HD's end up with
blown buffers.

No.  It is an SB Live OEM card.

So I'm assuming then that the SBLive 40 pin interface is NOT
IDE?  Is it then an older Mitsumi or Sony interface?
Seems odd that a modern sound card would support ancient CDROM
hardware...  That is why I assumed that it might actually be real
IDE.
Any other info would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks.

I've overclocked my keyboard interface.  It's quite messy dipping my
hands into the mineral oil, but *MAN* is my keyboard ever fast now!
