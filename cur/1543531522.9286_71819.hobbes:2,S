It gets through the 'partition check' okay, and then hangs (with all cpus
running).   The next thing my 2.2.14 kernel does at that point is installs a
raid module.
I am guessing that the 2.3.99 tried to do something with a raid module and
failed.   Any ideas why?   I have the latest modutils installed.
