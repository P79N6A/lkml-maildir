If you change it now, how many tools would break?
Maybe if you can list what statistics you think should be common to all
systems, that could be presented in another file that is always the same
format on each architecture.
Certainly looking at arm and i386, other than the bogomips field there
is nothing in common between their cpuinfo contents.  THey don't even
capitalize bogomips the same either.
I doubt this is really doable.  If all you want is the number of CPUs
then something like sysconf(_SC_NPROCESSORS_CONF) should do.
