What bios version do you use? Have you tried a CMOS reset?
I have the same motherboard but a different problem with the hpt chip, only 
the first channel is recognized. (see 
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=97824
)

Currently the driver provided by highpoint 
(
http://www.highpoint-tech.com/hpt3xx-opensource-v131.tgz
) is working ok for 
me (apart from it's lack of s.ma.r.t. support).
Did you try this?
