Yes. I came to the same conclusion after having sent it off. I hope
the following patch is more acceptable.
This will always invalidate the page cache whenever we try to obtain
the lock, hence you are guaranteed that the cache will be reread after
the lock was grabbed.
After unlocking however one needs no guarantees other than ensuring
that any modifications were committed while we held the lock, so we
flush the writebacks, drop the lock, and leave it at that.
Cheers,
  Trond
