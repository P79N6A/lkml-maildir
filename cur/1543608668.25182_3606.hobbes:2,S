Yes. Currently, the kernel "tries" to keep the LRU list of pages with 90%
of mapped pages and 10% of cache when there is memory pressure.
By looking at mm/vmscan.c::shrink_cache() you can see:
        int max_scan = nr_inactive_pages / priority;
        int max_mapped = nr_pages << (9 - priority);
"max_scan" is the max. number of pages the kernel will scan on the
inactive list (the inactive list is usually 1/3 of the total amount of
pages) each time "shrink_cache()" is called.
"max_mapped" is the (roughly) maximum number of non-cache (anonymous)
pages the kernel will scan _before_ it tries to search for data to map to
swap. So basically right now we will scan 
You should try to increase "max_mapped" to "nr_pages << (10 - priority)"
and so on until you get good tuning for your workload.
