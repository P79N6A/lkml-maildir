I don't have any native x86 binaries on my Madison-based testbox, so my
test case was to compile a simple program that counted total length of
argument strings on an x86 box, and copy it to my ia64 box.  So that I
wouldn't have to copy over a bunch of libraries too, I compiled it
with -static.  This is the test case that "hung" my system (re-running
it today from /dev/tty1 instead of from an xterm, I see that it actually
oopsed in rb_next()).  I wasn't even running with a long arglist.  Just
"*" for my home directory (19 files/directories = ~170 bytes).

My test program.  Compile on ia32 box with "cc -static -o args args.c"
---- begin args.c ----
main(int argc, char **argv)
{
	int n;
	printf("argc = %d\n", argc);
	n = 0;
	while (--argc)
		n += strlen(*++argv);
	printf("bytes = %d\n", n);
}
