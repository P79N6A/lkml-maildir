I've been having issues with the realtime patch set and using scp
(specifically scp, wget, curl, git, cvs everything else works fine). I
was wondering what extra debugging features are helpful to have built
into the kernel that could help me nail down why this bug is
happening.
Specifically what's happening is scp is freezing my system, there
haven't been any kernel warnings or panics upon execution of scp, it
just freezes, every other application that uses network seems to work
just fine, so far it's just been scp.
