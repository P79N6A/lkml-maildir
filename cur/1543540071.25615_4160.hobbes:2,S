	Not and have it architecturally independant. IIRC, ioremap()
of a PCI memory region must be used on all architectures, and
simply dereferencing the pointer to that memory won't work 
on many architectures - with the *notable* exception of x86.
	I would recommend creating a block device, where each 
block corresponds to a flash memory segment. Then, in your
block handler, use the readl()/writel() IO macros to access
the remapped PCI region and thanser data to the blocks request.
	Simple, easy, and would allow the mounting of a FAT filesystem 
on the SmartMedia...
	IIRC, there should be hooks in the block layer to allow
you to do control the re-ordering of blocks to minimize the
number of write cycles.
