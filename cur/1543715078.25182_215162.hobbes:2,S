Sorry about that, that's actually expected when we know this bug
exists. You need to move the cfq_remove_merge_hints(q, crq) before the
BUG_ON(q->last_merge == rq) check, or (better) just remove it
completely. There's no way that q->last_merge could be set to this
request after cfq_remove_merge_hints() was called.
