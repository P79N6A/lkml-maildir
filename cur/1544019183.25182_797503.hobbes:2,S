Hi list,
I have tried the p4-clockmod module in Linux kernel 2.6.29 on Xeon 5355 quad-core CPUs with no luck. It seems current p4-clockmod driver still cannot support Intel Quad core processors, right? 
I know I can also use acpi-cpufreq. It can only scale down the frequence from 2.67GHz to 2GHz. But I need some lower frequencies for some experiments.
Thanks!
Xiaoning
