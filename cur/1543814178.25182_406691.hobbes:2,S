  I am afraid purely defensive code should go through efi memory map and
find out the ar.k0. This can be done in purgatory code, In my current
pugatory implement, ar.k0 is take from the previous kernel, but I can
modify it to pick the value from efi memmap if this is really a concern.

  But we are running in physical mode, how could VHPT walker be
invoked?

   I am afraid the irq and device disable code in machine_shutdown in
your patch will never be called because kernel has already iterate on
each device and called the driver->shutdown method for them, and I don't
think we need to set affinity and power state here.
   Please take a look at my patch, machine_shutdown is empty except CPU
down code. There is another function device_shootdown used at the time
of crashing.

  I have also tested tens of thousands round of kexec to kexec over my
patch, I have never seem device shutdown issue.
  I still prefer small and clean kernel patch than put too much
redundant code in kernel.
  Thanks.
