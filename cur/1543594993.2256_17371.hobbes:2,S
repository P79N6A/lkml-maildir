I've done that in my rulesfile, thanks.  Here is the current list of ignored
symbols:

derive DRM_AGP from DRM and AGP!=n
derive FB_PCI from FB and PCI
derive FB_TBOX from n
derive NET_ISA from NET_ETHERNET and ISA
derive NET_PCI from NET_ETHERNET and (EISA or PCI)
derive PARTITION_ADVANCED from EXPERT
# These are scheduled to be removed, according to the ARM port manager.
derive CPU_ARM920_CPU_IDLE from n
derive CPU_ARM920_D_CACHE_ON from n
derive CPU_ARM920_I_CACHE_ON from n
# Nicolas Pitre says "This one is currently unmaintained and likely to be 
# removed altogether."
derive SA1100_SHERMAN from n
# These are used in config.in files but nowhere in C code or Makefiles.
# Check this with `scripts/kxref.py -l -f "o&~m&~c&~h&~x" -n defconfig'
