This only matters under paravirt; non-paravirt kernels and kernels 
running on native hardware will always behave properly.
But paravirtualized kernels with fake devices have no need to udelay to 
accommodate slow hardware - the hardware is just virtual.  The 
USE_REAL_TIME_DELAY define allows udelay to be specifically reverted 
back to being a real delay.  There are only a couple cases where it 
matters - one is booting APs on SMP systems (there is a real delay 
before they come up), and one is any hardware that drives world 
interacting devices - such as keyboard LEDs in a panic loop.
