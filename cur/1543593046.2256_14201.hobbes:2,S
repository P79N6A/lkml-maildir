Nope, I'd take it up with the driver developers.  For what it's worth,
the Intel Ether-Express Pro cards are the only ones I've found yet that
really work right at high speeds.  Intel's e100 driver seems to work really
well for me, but the eepro driver also works well with most versions of
the eepro cards I've used...
I have had definate problems with the natsemi (locked up), tulip (won't
autonegotiate multi-port cards correctly, or something), rtl8139 (would
lock up, haven't tried recent drivers though)....
I used to assume that Linux had the best/fastest networking support around,
but the reality is that I've had a really hard time finding hardware/drivers
that works at high speeds (60Mbps+, bi-directional).
