Well, it isn't do_gettimeofday that needs to be called, but we need a
way to decide if we should call tsc_mark_unstable(). Currently we do
that when we get a cpufreq transition notification if the cpu's TSC is
not constant.  The problem being: on your system, that notification
isn't called until after the cpufreq driver module loads. This is of
course, after we've started to use the TSC.
If the cpufreq driver loaded earlier, or we had some other way of
checking if the TSC was not constant, we could call tsc_mark_unstable()
then.
We'll probably have to do a manual check like what the cpufreq driver
does early on so we can have this info before we install the TSC
clocksource. I'll let you know when I have a patch to try.

Drat. Well, thanks for testing.
