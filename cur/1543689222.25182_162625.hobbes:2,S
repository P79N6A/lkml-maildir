Hi Andrew!
about a month ago I did a first version of the
Bind Mount Extensions (2.4 and 2.6), allowing 
ro --bind mounts, now this stuff seems pretty 
stable to me, and I would like to have it tested 
some more ... I'm still waiting for Al Viro to 
find some time for me, so I thoght maybe it would 
be possible to include it in some actually used 
patchsets?
what do you think?
TIA,
Herbert
