It matters because MSI totally changes the DMA vs. interrupt delivery
guarentees.
With MSI, you can be assured that any DMA sent from the device, before
the interrupt, has reached global visibility before the MSI arrives at
the cpu.  There is no such guarentee with pre-MSI interrupt delivery.
Drivers optimize this, so they have to know if MSI is being used or
not.
