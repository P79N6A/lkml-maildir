The only reason we care in NFS is in order to be able to deal with
server reboot recovery -- which requires you to have an extensive list
of all locks that are held -- and, as you note above, in order to ensure
that locks are all cleared upon process exit.
For flock() locks, I agree: you can probably whittle that information
down to a single bit per open file. For POSIX locks, you need the byte
ranges and lockowner/pid information too...
Cheers,
