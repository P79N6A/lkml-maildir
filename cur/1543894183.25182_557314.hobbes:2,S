And Red Hat can't either.  I thought that was quite obvious.

The 'passing on the rights you have' makes it an issue.

Compare the preambles of v2 and v3 and you'll understand why the
argument is sound, and not circular.

But individual freedom, rather than community freedom.
Think local vs global optimization.

Because, like you, I'm always right, even though not everyone agrees
with that assessment? ;-P :-D

Yes, of course.  The new legal terms are answers to new threats to the
freedoms depicted in the preamble, that didn't exist or hadn't been
thought of by the time GPLv2 was published.

Yes.

Within the boundaries of ethics and morals, yes.

The thing is I'm not arguing that point.
I'm disputing that there was a change in the spirit of the license
between v2 and v3.  Heck, a mere 48 hours ago you couldn't even tell
the spirit from the legal terms.
I still think v3 will serve better any Free Software community,
because it will push away the abusers that contribute little, or turn
them into cooperative or at least harmless participants, that further
enable the active participation of their downstream users.  This would
enable wider participation under the same 'tit-for-tat' conditions
that you attribute to GPLv2.
It appears to me that the only significant point of contention
remaining is the issue of Tivoization.  If you feel so strongly about
permitting Tivoization, even though it denies the freedoms that the
original spirit of the license you chose says they are entitled to
have, you can make this provision by means of an additional permission
for that, on top of GPLv3, and be done with it.

Yes, indeed.
