No, but where is the problem? ;)
If you don't want to go in too much big troubles with a crash or a
power-loss, then simply run update.

If bdflush is active you want to sleep and wait of I/O completation if
there are too many dirty buffers.

I run some bonnie here too and I changed some worthwhile thing since
2.2.8_andrea1. I have a fully-featured buffer patch almost ready against
2.2.9. I am finishing to fix a memleak (just a minor issue ;), then I'll
post it here.
BTW my code you merged into your -z patch had a minor issue (not really a
bug). Just fixed here though. Wait the new patch then feel free to copy my
code into your patch again (or take a more polite option: provide patches
incremental with my pending buffer patch ;).
