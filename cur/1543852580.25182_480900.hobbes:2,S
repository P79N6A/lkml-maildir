You need to be careful that file->f_op->poll is not called inside the 
spin_lock_irqsave/spin_lock_irqrestore pair, since (even this came up 
during epoll developemtn days) file->f_op->poll might do a simple 
spin_lock_irq/spin_unlock_irq. This unfortunate constrain forced epoll to 
have a suboptimal double O(R) loop to handle LT events.
