Those are just defaults, If a user is going to run a higher priority
task and needs the use to those IRQS then they need to adjust the
priorities of the interrupts themselves.
But remember that the softirqs which handle the bottom halve of
interrupts are also threads, and they run at even a lower priority.  So
if the interrupt uses its bottom half to send a signal to the process,
then if you have a RT task lower in priority than the IRQ but higher
than the softirq, it can still prevent the signal being sent.
Could you send a sample program that shows us the problem?  This would
help us out in figuring out what is wrong.  I still suspect that it's a
configuration problem, but who knows, maybe you found an indiscernible
bug.
Also, I've been ask to write a section in an O'Reilly book about how to
use the -rt patch.  Knowing problems that users may have (such as the
one you are experiencing) would help greatly in explaining to others the
proper way to configure their setup.
