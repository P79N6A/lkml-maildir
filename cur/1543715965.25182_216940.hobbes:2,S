That might make sense.  One problem is that writepage expects to be passed
a locked page whereas writepages() does not.
Any code which implements writearound-inside-writepage should be targetted
at a generic implementation, not an fs-specific one if poss.  We could go
look at the ->vm_writeback() a_op which was in in 2.5.20 or thereabouts. 
it was causing problems and had no discernable benefits so I ripped it out.
A writearound-within-writepage implementation would need to decide whether
it's goign to use lock_page() or TryLockPage().  I expect lock_page() will
be OK - we only call in there for __GFP_FS allocators.
