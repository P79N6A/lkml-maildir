In some of the traces, like this one:
http://krustophenia.net/testresults.php?dataset=2.6.8-rc4-bk3-O7#/var/www/2.6.8-rc4-bk3-O7/mount_reiserfs_latency_trace.txt
there are calls to voluntary_resched.  How is this possible?  Does it
mean that we called voluntary_resched while holding a spinlock, where we
needed to call voluntary_preempt_lock(&foo_lock), and thus failed to
reschedule?
