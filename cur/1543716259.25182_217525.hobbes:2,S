If you look at the price of a cardbus real modem on ebay, you might be
surprised that these things are really cheap. Sometimes buying software to
support the winmodems is actually more expensive than buying a real modem.

How would you know NOT to complain to linux-kernel if there is no sign you
shouldn't?

Was there anything else that could have been done for the existing fake
GPL modules?

I have this FUCKING Linuxant .rpm with an empty GPL directory right on my
hard disk. And this .rpm is signed by Linuxant. So either Linuxant has
been hacked (someone stole the key, signed a bogus rpm and broke into thir
site uploading it) or they are careless (forgetting to fill the GPL
directory for some packages). In both cases I would not trust them.
