I was only using your terminology (ie. the 'lazy' synch after the
atomic is updated).
Actually, a better idea would be to make a specific sysctl handler
like Christoph said.
Unless you can show some improvement, it would better not to introduce
the racy hack (even if it is mostly harmless).

atomic_inc_return guarantees a memory barrier, while the former
statements do not. I'm fairly sure it will be more expensive on
a POWER5.
