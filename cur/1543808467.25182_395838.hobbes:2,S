Ok, now this I did not know which is why I personally objected to it.  I saw
no reason to have it with usb-storage since both did something similar.  Now
that I know what it's purpose is, I don't see a problem with it as far as
availability to the ones who are low memory, embedded, etc, but I won't need
it myself.  I normally use systtems with scsi controllers and need the full
scsi layer.
If/When libata takes over ide in general, how many of these machine will
then require the scsi layer?  I would think all systems would except ones
without internal disks (non-usb/firewire).
I do appreciate the info, thanks.
