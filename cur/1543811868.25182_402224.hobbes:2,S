I can only speak for libaio, which is completely thread safe.  Having a 
single thread read events and dispatch is likely to work quite well given 
the way the kernel interface is structured internally.  There is still 
room for improving the event mechanism to use a futex for waking so that 
the library can parse multiple events from userspace, but that is pending 
a heavier user like networking.
