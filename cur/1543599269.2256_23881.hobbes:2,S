Yes, good point.  OK, I'll re-examine the dropping logic.  Bear in mind, 
dropping readahead pages is not supposed to happen frequently under 
steady-state operation, so it's not that critical what we do here, it's going 
to be hard to create a load that shows the impact.  The really big benefit 
comes from not overdoing the readahead in the first place, and not underdoing 
it either.

Not if they never get a change to be moved to the active list.  We have to be 
careful to provide that opportunity.

Readahead definitely can help in some types of random access loads, e.g., 
when access size is larger than a page, or when the majority of pages of a 
file are eventually accessed, but in random order.  On the other hand, it 
will only hurt for short, sparse, random reads.  Such a pattern needs to be 
detected in generic_file_readahead.
