This has now been superceded by ext3-0.0.2f (patch enclosed), which
fixes a major bug --- the new truncate code in 0.0.2e did not
propagate extensions of existing directories to disk (existing,
sufficiently-padded directories would not be affected, but appending a
lot of new dirents to an existing directory could leave the new
dirents unreachable after a reboot).  e2fsck should be able to restore
the directories if this has caught anybody --- the contents of the
directories was not lost, only the update of the on-disk copy of the
directory's size was being missed.
I'll push a complete set of clean ext3-0.0.2f patches out to
ftp.uk.linux.org shortly, but in the mean time please apply the patch
below if you are running 0.0.2e.  
Andreas, I also found that your orphan list code was missing the case
of a "rmdir" of a directory still being used as the working directory
of an existing process.  0.0.2f should also clean up such a case on
reboot.
Cheers,
 Stephen
