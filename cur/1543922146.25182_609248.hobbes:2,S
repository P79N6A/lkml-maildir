In general, none of the kernel synchronization-type functions should 
have been used in userspace since they often depend on infrastructure 
which is only in the kernel in order to work properly. The new headers 
installation system strips out any code intended for kernel use only 
from the userspace-visible headers.
(Not to mention the licensing issues - the kernel is GPL, not LGPL, so 
only GPL programs could have legally done so in the first place.)
