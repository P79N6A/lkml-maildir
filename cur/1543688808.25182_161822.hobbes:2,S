Hunt groups.  I want incoming sales and support calls to go to group
of people.  All the "virtual PBX" solutions do a lame hunt where they
ring the first guy 3 times, then the next guy 3 times, etc.  The 3com
rings everyone at the same time.  Believe it or not, if you guys call
for support I want someone to pick up the phone *right now*.  If you
or our commercial customers are having nasty BK problems I don't want
you to wait while the stupid phone system goes hunting around looking
for someone who isn't out to lunch or whatever.
