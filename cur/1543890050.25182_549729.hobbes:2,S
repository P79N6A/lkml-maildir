The primary problem with that is that "mv somefile otherfile" must  
change the labels, which means that every process that issues a rename 
() syscall needs to have special handling of labels.  The other  
problem is that many of the features and capabilities of SELinux get  
left by the wayside.  On an SELinux system 90% of the programs don't  
need to be modified to understand labels, since the policy can define  
automatic label transitions.  SELinux also allows you to have  
conditional label privileges based on boolean variables, something  
that cannot be done if the privileges themselves are stored in the  
filesystem.  Finally, such an approach does not allow you to  
differentiate between programs.
