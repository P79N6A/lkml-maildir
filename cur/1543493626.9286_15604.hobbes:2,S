I am still working on that a little bit.

How about CAP_LINUX_RESERVE_NORMAL_0 through CAP_LINUX_RESERVE_NORMAL_15
being defined for future caps which are new caps that presently availible
to everyone even non-root ones.

Thats easily done and won't even break the draft just define the default
fI to be pP&(CAP_LINUX_RESERVE_NORMAL_0 | ...
|CAP_LINUX_RESERVE_NORMAL_15) for unmarked executable files.
you might just save yourself some trouble and say fI=pP ;->
BTW thought you might want to know that my patch now supports what you
want done with "pure" caps via securebits mechanisms. I defined a new
SECURE_PURE_CAP thingy which hopefully you might like. I'll send out a
quick snapshot.

Warning when I mention capabilites I mean "soiled" capabilities not "pure".
Any caps I mention are *derived* from a withdrawn draft posix document.
