   To solve a problem while listing filters you may add this patch.
   It works for all kernel versions from  2.4.6 to 2.4.11
   It wold be cool to have it in the next kernel release.
What is the "problem"?  Why should it only call the walker function
on entries which equal tp->root?  This change doesn't make any sense
to me.
You need to describe the problem and how your changes solve
that problem.
Franks a lot,
