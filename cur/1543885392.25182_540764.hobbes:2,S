At some point that could be a problem, I have a shared printer on 
parallel (and replacing a printer for 11x17 work isn't cheap), as well 
as one PL/IP requirement, which is embedded in industrial machinery not 
likely to be upgraded.
Non-critical in the sense that I'm sure I can run old kernels for a 
decade if needed, but hopefully something to be fixed. Since there's no 
regressions list any more, I guess we will all have to complain about 
problems individually. :-(
