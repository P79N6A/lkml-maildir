Nope - there's an implied cast by virtue of the right side being unsigned 
in the comparison already.
Although I do believe that it would be better written as
	#define MAXGROUPS (1000) /* Arbitrary, but we have to limit it somehere */
	if ((unsigned) info->ngroups > MAXGROUPS)
		return -ETOOEFFINGLARGE;
as I absolutely _despise_ code that tries to be too generic. 
What is it with CS classes that have removed "common sense" from the 
equation?
