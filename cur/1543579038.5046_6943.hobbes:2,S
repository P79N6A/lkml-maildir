New data:
2.4.1pre3 + Marcelo's patch
       File   Block  Num  Seq Read    Rand Read   Seq Write  Rand Write
Dir    Size   Size   Thr Rate (CPU%) Rate (CPU%) Rate (CPU%) Rate (CPU%)
------- ------ ------- --- ----------- ----------- ----------- -----------
   .     1024   4096    2  12.68 9.23% 0.497 0.92% 10.57 15.3% 0.594 1.44%
The same performance level as for 2.4.0. No improvement.
2.4.1pre3 + Marcelo's patch + Jens Axboes' blk-13B patch 
         File   Block  Num  Seq Read    Rand Read   Seq Write  Rand Write
Dir    Size   Size   Thr Rate (CPU%) Rate (CPU%) Rate (CPU%) Rate (CPU%)
------- ------ ------- --- ----------- ----------- ----------- -----------
   .     1024   4096    2  12.47 10.0% 0.504 1.13% 9.998 16.5% 0.735 2.21%
No significant difference, just noise. IMHO, it is expected, since 2 threads
simply aren't enough to launch blk patch's mechanisms
