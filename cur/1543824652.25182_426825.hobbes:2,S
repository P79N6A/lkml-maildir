Are they really very hot? I mean if you're calling the DMA API, you're
about to frob the hardware or have already frobbed it - does this
check really matter?

It was helpful for us during the dma-ops work and Calgary bringup and
Andi requested that we move it from Calgary to common code. I think
we're fine with dropping it if that's the consensus, but it did catch
a few bugs early on and the cost is tiny.
Cheers,
