I just noticed that with v2.6.25-rc3-302-g03923eb, running
make builds the final .ko really quick. Maybe there has been
some magic added that skips a lot of directories, but the
process certainly takes less than 120 seconds, so I am happy.
Previously, it seemed to have visited lots of directories
(even though we know make is not called recursively in 2.6)
before it printed "Building modules stage 2" for the first time.
Nice :)
