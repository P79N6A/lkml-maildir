Hi!
The devices.txt file included in recent 2.4.x kernels
and the one at
http://www.lanana.org/docs/device-list/devices.txt
lacks infos about /dev/dspX and /dev/audioX , where
X is 2 or more.
I had to dig into the audio driver sources to figure
out that the minor number is
X * 16 + 3 for /dev/dspX and
X * 16 + 4 for /dev/audioX
