You might want to check out the Network Computing article from March
that compared wireless LAN products:
http://www.networkcomputing.com/1006/1006r2.html
This is a comprehensive review of "all" the current wireless LAN
products.  The biggest sticking point for me is the price: List prices
are in the $400-600 range for adapters and $1500-2000 range for base
stations/collectors.  I'd guess you need at least one of each, so call
it $2K just to play.  A lot of money for the convenience of moving your
laptop around -- I'm going to just rewire my house with cat5 UTP and put
RJ45 jacks here and there that run back to my switch.  100x the
bandwidth for the minor inconvenience of not being able to type and walk
at the same time.
Of course, if I had a pool on my estate, I might want wireless -- lying
next to the pool in the shade and working on my laptop while sipping an
ice cold beverage has its appeal. But then, if I had a pool (or an
"estate":-) I could probably afford it...;-)
