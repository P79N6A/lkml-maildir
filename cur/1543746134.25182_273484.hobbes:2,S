In fact, we would even use the same function for it (the only thing that
makes it SCI-specific right now is the "printk()" that says "SCI IRQ", the
rest really is totally generic.
So how about renaming "acpi_pic_sci_set_trigger()" to not have the "sci" 
part in there, and remove it's dependence on CONFIG_ACPI_BUS, and just 
using it in "apic_pci_link_add()" to make sure that any PCI links we find 
to be enabled have the right ELCR. That's _logical_, since if we were to 
actually enable them, we'd set ELCR right. So literally the only 
difference between disabling them at boot (and then re-enabling them when 
a driver finds them) _is_ that ELCR setting..
And that would make me much happier, because it's a "minimally intrusive" 
thing to do.
