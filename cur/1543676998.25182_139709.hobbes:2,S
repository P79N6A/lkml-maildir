Unlikely.  On my systems, the offset values are off by three orders of
magnitude, and are always negative.  There's a more basic error
somewhere before that test.
The actual impact of lost jiffies is pretty low, though.  I've beaten
vigorously on my systems with the time patch, and they don't lose timer
interrupts.
