Yes, the problem is the NIC itself.  ALL EtherExpress 16 cards
are flawed by design, and even Intel's own drivers randomly crash
under DOS, etc..  I had this problem before earlier this year,
and Alan Cox was kind enough to point this out to me.
The _ONLY_ solution to the problem is to get another Ethernet
card.  For PCI, I recommend either a DEC Tulip based card (#1),
or an Intel EtherExpress Pro 100.  Both are excellent and have
worked flawless for months on end.  For ISA, stick with a cheapo
NE2000 card based on the RealTek 8029 chip.
