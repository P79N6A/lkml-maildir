Basically: I love it. Maybe it would also be good (in the longer term)
to introduce a config name into one of the Kconfig files, which is
preserved in the .config file (eg. SuSE does something like that and
even while I'm not a SuSE user, it's really dandy at some times, esp.
for things like "SMP-4GB", "VAX-KA4x" and the like). It's basically like
adding the defconfig_* name to some of the variables :-)

PS: When will the package support show up?
