But all devices which export a CD-ROM interface will do so. So the
device node that is associated with the CD-ROM driver will export
CD-ROM semantics, and the trailing name will be "/cd".
Other interfaces a device exports, such as a CD-RW, appear as a
different device node ("generic" for SCSI, because we have no CD-RW
classification at this point).
My scheme works already, and works reliably. Nothing had to be done to
support the CD-ROM interface to CD-RW and DVD devices.
