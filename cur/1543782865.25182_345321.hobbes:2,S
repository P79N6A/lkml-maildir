Hi,
> Two n00b questions here:
> What does this do/what is it for?
I'm no guru, but its something like the resolution of the timer the kernel
runs. More Hz give you shorter timeslices and lower latency. Lower give
longer timeslices and higher latency.
Anybody please correct me if I am wrong here.
> I selected default, 250Hz.  If this is now an option, what was it before?
AFAIK previously we've had here 1000Hz.
Basically, for a server you'd want 100.
For a desktop 250
For a low-latency (eg. working on audio) you'd want 1000
Again, correct me if I am wrong.
Regards,
Maciej
