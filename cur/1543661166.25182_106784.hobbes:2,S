Unfortunately, I cannot find the original posting quoted above, since 
that would probably reveal where the actual usage of perl is.
Generally, we've been trying to not make perl a prequisite for the kernel 
build, and I'd like to keep it that way. Except for some arch specific 
stuff I don't really care about, the uses of perl are for the optional 
"make checkconfig" etc. (which btw look mostly obsolete and should 
probably be killed), and for generating some firmware, though by default a 
shipped version of the generated files is used.
That said, I'm not necessarily opposed to allowing for use of ',$ in the 
command variables as the change above does (getting that as a patch would 
be nice, though).
