Mostly. Primarily. That is because the only executable that results IS the
kernel.
There is the fuzzy area where you write a user mode application that uses
some Kernel headers for the purpose of doing things like an ext2fs debugger.
The kernel headers are NOT released under LGPL, but all of the libc functions
and include files are. The syscall interfaces were explicitly excluded as
requiring GPL because the Linus quote.
Personally, I think it would be a good idea to have these specific ones under
the LGPL instead of GPL, and then use them in both kernel and user space
(which the LGPL also allows).
If the header is not LGPL (which allows propriatary programs to include
them), then you run a severe risk of forcing the user mode application into 
GPL if it is distributed. I think this is more likely if the header includes
inline functions, and not in the case of those just defining the syscall data 
structures/interface.
One area this would clarify would be if someone tried to write a propriatary
kernel debugger... It would run in user mode, but look at/poke at kernel 
structures and functions in such detail that it SHOULD be a GPL program.
