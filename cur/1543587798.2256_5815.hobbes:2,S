I like this idea quite a bit.  It would probably not
be terribly expensive to rent/buy the required equipment,
it would be easy to use and would not be terribly disruptive
to the preceedings.
I'm curious, didn't you find that those mikes are too
directionally sensitive?  I've noticed that the movement
of the speaker by just an inch or two can cause major
variations in signal reception (I've only tried that
little plastic parabolic eavesdropping "toy" that was
all the rage about two Christmasses ago -- there was one
floating around my office).
