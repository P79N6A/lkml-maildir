Yes. I was expecting somebody to be a bit more 'direct'.
$ cd /usr/src/linux-whatever
$ cp .config ..
$ make mrproper
$ cp ../.config .
$ make oldconfig
$ make dep ; make bzImage ; make modules ; make modules_install
...trivial...
FYI, a <not recommended by many who have gotten burned> easy way to
make quick changes in the .config is to edit .config directly, then
execute `make oldconfig`. This usually works so you don't have to
answer a thousand questions.
