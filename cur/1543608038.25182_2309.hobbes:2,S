Paul, it is very possible that I smoke/drunk something wrong
and saw this in dreams, but I really remember that this bug
has been fixed in some 2.1.x. :-)
Only function is different: that time skb_unshare() did some
unitelligible thing and was used only by AX.25 for an unknown purpose.
So, the function which does the work was called skb_cow().
