I would try sticking some debug in arch/x86_64/pci/mmconfig.c at the 
beginning and end of pci_mmcfg_read and pci_mmcfg_write to print the 
seg, bus, devfn and reg for each read and write. Hopefully that will 
track down the one that is causing the lockup, if it is an actual 
MMCONFIG access that's doing it..
