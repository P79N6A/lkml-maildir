Sorry thats what I meant to say but got it backwards. There are a lot of
users of the value actually - all the serial drivers for example use it
to get the right results. Networking too gets fun because you can send a
packet and want to report that you did something before the fault
occurred. True POSIX doesn't seem to require this behaviour (I guess it
wants to define passing bogus addresses as undefined because of MMUless
systems and library emulation of calls).

Who cares? Faults are not fast paths. Also if I understand sparc64
correctly it doesn't have to go back and copy one at a time because a
fault can only occur on a page boundary. That means for the normal case
you already know where the fault occurred and for the unusual case its
one probe per page, all non fast-path.
