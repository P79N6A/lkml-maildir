Problem recap:
  * modprobe oopses with null pointer right after loading olympic module
  * problem still occurs upto 2.4.2ac5
I've not been able to capture the oops due to other hardware problems,
but have narrowed the problem down:
 1) modprobe ipv6
    modprobe olympic
    ---> Oops & reboot
 2) modprobe olympic
    modprobe ipv6
    ---> still running (ok, so its only been 20 minutes, but hey that
         is *significantly* better than Oops on bootup)
