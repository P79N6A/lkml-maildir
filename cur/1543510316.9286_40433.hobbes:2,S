Jeff Garzik had the wisdom to write:
JG> When you include proc_fs.h you should not need _any_ ifdefs at all. 
JG> Inlined no-op versions of the procfs API functions are substituted when
Not completely true. The functions are stubbed, but things like proc_root
and the inode-operations aren't. Although Alan fixed the ugliest part in
2.1.13x, CONFIG_PROC_FS is still very ugly, and a lot of ifdef's are needed.
RFC: Get rid of CONFIG_PROC_FS
I hereby propose to get rid of the configuration-option CONFIG_PROC_FS and
make the proc-filesystem mantadory.
Reasons for doing so:
1) It cleans up a lot of code 
2) There probably not one single sole that doesn't use procfs
3) The kernel _might_ build without procfs, but nobody tested if the
   stubs actually work
4) Codesize is hardly an issue, since the stubs also increase codesize
Reasons for not doing so:
1) Codesize (?)
2) Featurefreeze
3) Security (?)
I therefore propose to make CONFIG_PROC_FS mantadory. If the kernel-gods
agree, I volunteer to send a patch (or more likely, a group of patches) for
it.
Any comments ?
Greetings,
  Arjan van de Ven
