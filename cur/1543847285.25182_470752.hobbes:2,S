Mauro, please pull from:
|git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/mkrufky/v4l-dvb.git
to fix the issue described by Mike Isely, above... ||or just apply the
attached patch to your git tree and send to Linus.|

This problem is only present in your git tree -- the hg tree is in good
shape.  How did this happen, Mauro?
Regards,
Michael Krufky

Subject: [PATCH] Kconfig: restore pvrusb2 menu items
Looks like the pvrusb2 menu items were accidentally removed in
git commit 1450e6bedc58c731617d99b4670070ed3ccc91b4
This patch restores the menu items so that the pvrusb2 driver can be built.
