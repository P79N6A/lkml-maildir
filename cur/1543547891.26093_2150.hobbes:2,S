In response to Al (I don't think I've got his mail, still got 150 emails
to look at since last night):
Been there, done that, maybe you'd like to look at the ARM code which contains
the machine_is_xxx()?  These essentially reduce down to one of three possible
values:
1. (0)
2. (MACH_TYPE_ASSABET == MACH_TYPE_ASSABET)
3. (__machine_type == MACH_TYPE_ASSABET)
The relevent definition is chosen by a set of pre-processor generated out of
arch/arm/tools/gen-mach-types.
Whilst it is good to remove redunant code, you still need #ifdefs...#endifs,
so I wouldn't recommend this style of configuration management for the
generic kernel.
Think about this:
struct bar foo_specific = {
	...
};
struct bar *goo()
{
	if (CONFIG_FOO)
		return &foo_specific;
	else
		return NULL;
}
Unfortunately, the compiler always generates dataspace for both structures,
even if CONFIG_FOO is 0.  So, how do we get rid of them?  Simple, surround
them with #if CONFIG_FOO...#endif.  Oh dear, the symbol is now undefined.
I guess we must add #if CONFIG_FOO around the if (CONFIG_FOO) as well.  Ug,
I suppose we might as well just do:
struct bar *goo()
{
#if CONFIG_FOO
	return &foo_specific;
#else
	return NULL;
#endif
}
and be done with it.
Yes, I'd agree a good idea, and may apply to some small bits of code, but
not as a general kernel-wide thing.  And converting the #ifdefs all to #ifs
is going to be a nightmarish large patch (before even thinking of making
configure produce the "define CONFIG_FOO as 0 or 1" you have first got to
make sure that there are no #ifdef CONFIG_FOO statements in existance.
(Note that the reason we do it on the ARM is NOT because we have a never
or always condition, but because we have never, maybe or always conditions,
and this is the easiest way to fix them up.  But.  We still need #ifdefs
#endifs).
