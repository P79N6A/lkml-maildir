OK finally I could reproduce it and found why we have this. It's
expected in fact.
The problem when we loop in tcp_read_sock() is that tss->len is
not decremented by the amount of bytes read, this one is done
only in tcp_splice_read() which is outer.
The solution I found was to do just like other callers, which means
use desc->count to keep the remaining number of bytes we want to
read. In fact, tcp_read_sock() is designed to use that one as a stop
condition, which explains why you first had to hide it.
Now with the attached patch as a replacement for my previous one,
both issues are solved :
  - I splice 1000 bytes if I ask to do so
  - I splice as much as possible if available (typically 23 kB).
My observed performances are still at the top of earlier results
and IMHO that way of counting bytes makes sense for an actor called
from tcp_read_sock().
