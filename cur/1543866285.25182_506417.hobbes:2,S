No, not that.  But the virtual keyboard I/O gets processed and converted 
to physical keyboard I/O when a keyboard is attached to a VM.  The 
result is that the virtual keyboard spinning out of control causes the 
physical keyboard to receive the same commands, far too rapidly.
So the keyboard blinks out of control and acts as if possessed by demons.
