Subject: [PATCH] IPMI driver for Linux, version 6

Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Yet one more update, mostly fixes for stylistic things that Randy Dunlap 
pointed out, and a bug fix that lets the KCS state machine get out of 
the "hosed" state on the next message (buggy hardware can sometimes be 
useful :-).  As usual, on my home page at  
http://home.attbi.com/~minyard.

PS - In case you don't know, IPMI is a standard for system management, 
it provides ways to detect the managed devices in the system and sensors 
attached to them.  You can get more information at
