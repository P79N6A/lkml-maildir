Significance of change is not an issue, assuming the change is broken  
up into a collection of small obvious changes as highlighted in  
Documentation/SubmittingPatches

Why not?  It's easy to change APIs, even stuff as invasive as the VM,  
the device driver model, etc, and those get changed all the time.

You don't have to worry all that much about testing.  If your patches  
are small and obviously correct (like they should be), then they will  
get enough review during submission that there will only be a very  
small number of bugs.  The few remaining bugs will probably be ironed  
out in -mm.  In any case, if nobody uses hardware anymore, eventually  
the driver will get sufficiently crufty and out of date that it will  
be recognized as such and removed.

Jeff Garzik et. al. seem to think that they are necessary, and I  
agree.  You don't need to fork SCSI-core; doing so would just double  
the maintainer load, and _that_ is neither warranted nor necessary.

Precisely.  When nobody uses the legacy drivers to the point that  
they aren't fixed or maintained anymore because no-one reports bugs,  
then said drivers can be removed from the kernel entirely, along with  
any support code.  The model I describe here works better because it  
keeps a _single_ clean core subsystem, and leaves any lack-of- 
maintenance crap in the old drivers.

Until somebody wants to add a new high-level SCSI feature that works  
for both the new and the old devices.  Then they have to do it _twice_.

So you're saying fixing the current SCSI subsystem once *now* costs  
more than applying all *future* SCSI fixes to _two_ SCSI subsystems,  
handling bug reports for _two_ SCSI subsystems, etc.

Politics are not an integral part of productive technical  
discussions, though.  If you discuss technical topics and provide  
realistic technical descriptions, examples, reasons, code, etc, then  
politics tends not to matter in the discussion, and we're all happier  
people.
