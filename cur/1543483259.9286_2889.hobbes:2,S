That's why I have yet to run 2.2.0pre9 or 2.2.1 on my RH 5.2
system, as I have a ESS1688 that works perfectly under 2.0.*
but under the newer 2.2.* I always seem to get (esp. whith
longer
.wav formats):
Sound: DMA (output) timed out - IRQ/DRQ config error?
Truly, I have played with tens of combinations all resulting
in the same above output (and I _FEEL_ it is a BUFFERing issue;
as the old kernel configs showed a DSP_BUFFSIZE=65536 as a
tweakable option...but I am obviously not a hacker!).
Are we the _ONLY TWO_ having this problem?  I'm going
through the source docs...nothing yet...
