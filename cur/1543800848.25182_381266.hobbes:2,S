These patches are wordwrapped and cannot be applied.
You've included three separate patches in the body of a single email. 
Please don't do that.  One patch per email is preferred.
So please redo these patches against 2.6.15 and resend them, as per
http://www.zip.com.au/~akpm/linux/patches/stuff/tpp.txt,
 thanks.
