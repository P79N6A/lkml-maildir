Not sure I agree completely. Yes it will work, but only because it tests
<= q->nr_requests and I don't think that 'eventually' is good enough :-)
The actual waitqueue manipulation doesn't happen under the queue lock,
so the memory barrier is needed to pickup the change on SMP. So I'd like
to keep the barrier.
I'd prefer to add smp_mb() to waitqueue_active() actually!
