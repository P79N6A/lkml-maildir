Well that's a shame.

Prefer the first version.  But it'll break if CONFIG_X86_IO_APIC &&
!CONFIG_ACPI
So how's about this?
From: Herbert Poetzl <herbert@13thfloor.at>
check_acpi_pci() is called from arch/i386/kernel/setup.c even if
CONFIG_ACPI is not defined, but the code in include/asm/acpi.h doesn't
provide it in this case.
