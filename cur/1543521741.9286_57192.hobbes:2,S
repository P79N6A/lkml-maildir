actually I thought you meant the opposite, i.e. in exceptional cases run
time performance is more important than compilation time, which is why I
gave loading a binary example. In all other cases (e.g. requesting a
module when opening a device an extra function call is exactly what I
called it - "almost nothing"). In cases where it adds substantial overhead
of re-walking through the entire list (e.g. get_fs_type which walks
through file_systems) the caller should (and does) check the return from
request_module() and only does the extra work if it is == 0.
Regards,
Tigran.
