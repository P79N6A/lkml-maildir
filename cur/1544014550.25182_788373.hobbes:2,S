-7. TODO
+7. Soft limits
+
+Soft limits allow for greater sharing of memory. The idea behind soft limits
+is to allow control groups to use as much of the memory as needed, provided
+
+a. There is no memory contention
+b. They do not exceed their hard limit
+
+When the system detects memory contention (through do_try_to_free_pages(),
+while allocating), control groups are pushed back to their soft limits if
+possible. If the soft limit of each control group is very high, they are
+pushed back as much as possible to make sure that one control group does not
+starve the others.
+
+7.1 Interface
+
+Soft limits can be setup by using the following commands (in this example we
+assume a soft limit of 256 megabytes)
+
+# echo 256M > memory.soft_limit_in_bytes
+
+If we want to change this to 1G, we can at any time use
+
+# echo 1G > memory.soft_limit_in_bytes
+
+
+8. TODO
 
 1. Add support for accounting huge pages (as a separate controller)
 2. Make per-cgroup scanner reclaim not-shared pages first
