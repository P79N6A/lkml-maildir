Do you honestly think with the current "2.6 forever" development process 
that this is likely, even possible any more?
Given that fact, it means the current scheduler policy mechanism is 
effectively set in stone. Do you think we can polish the current 
scheduler enough to be, if not perfect, good enough for _every_ situation?
Noone said that if we have a plugsched infrastructure that we should 
instantly accept any scheduler.
