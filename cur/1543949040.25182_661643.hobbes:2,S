Not exactly, because in that case we blocked all attempts to register devices,
while I think we can only block those regarding the children of a suspending
(or suspended) device.

I'm not really convinced that it'll happen.  If we make the rule that
registering children from the device's own ->suspend() method is forbidden
(I don't really see why it should be allowed), something like this might work
(it seems to me):

That doesn't buy us anything if drivers don't check whether the registration
succeeded.  And they don't.

Not exactly.  Just the children of suspended devices, which makes a difference
IMO. :-)

Well, my impression is that we do this thing to prepare for removing the
freezer in the future, so I'd rather solve issues in some other ways than just
by freezing threads that get in the way. ;-)

They may be handled in a different way, not by ->resume().

Still, it doesn't look very nice ...
