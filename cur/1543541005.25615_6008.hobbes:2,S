kdb (no 'g') from SGI can do the same without a serial line.  Then it is 
as simple as btp <pid>
The other option is to compile a vmlinux with debugging symbols (-g), 
do gdb vmlinux /proc/kcore (note that on 2.2 /proc/kcore is a.out so you
may need a gdb that can read a.out or a ELF kcore patch), use the appended
ps macro to find the task structure of your thread, display its tss.esp 
member and backtrace from that.

define ps 
set $inittask = &(init_task_union.task)
set $t = $inittask->next_task
while $t != $inittask
	output $t
	output "\t"
        output $t->pid
        output "\t"
        output $t->comm
        echo
        set  $t = $t->next_task
end
end
