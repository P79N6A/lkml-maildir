I understand your concern. But since I am working on a dynamic memory 
management code that I wish to use with other projects that I have, I 
didn't find appropriate to use shm_open.
In fact there is a name associated with the shared memory requested with 
shm_open, so that it can be mmap(ed) in another process. And I do not 
wish to have it accessible by any other process, unless I choose to do so.
shm_open is great, but it doesn't quite fit my needs.
And I think remap(ing) ANONYMOUS memory kind of make a lot of things easier.
Can that feature be added at least to release candidates series so that 
everybody can try it and see how well it does?
Sincerely,
William Tambe
