I've got that Oops while testing my fix of the tmscsim driver for 2.6. It
was test7. The driver worked, except in that only configuration, where
I've got the reported Oops. I just tried a working configuration (with
preempt enabled) and enabled DEBUG_PAGEALLOC - it still worked... So,
unless it REALLY was an impossible bug, that somehow impossibly
disappeared again (the only thing I can say - I couldn't have written that
Oops by hand just out of my head...:-)) - it should really be a
combination of all those parameters. I am currently recompiling test10
with that configuration, will try test7 again, if this one doesn't
reproduce the bug, will report results tomorrow. If I get the Oops again -
will attach the complete .config.
Thanks
