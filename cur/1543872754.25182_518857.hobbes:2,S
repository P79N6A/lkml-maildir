Duh! Forgot to update the documenation. Now timerfd() gets an itimerspec.
For TFD_TIMER_REL only the it_interval is valid, and it's the relative 
time. For TFD_TIMER_ABS, only the it_value is valid, and that the expiry 
absolute time. For TFD_TIMER_SEQ, it_value tells when the first tick 
should be generated, and it_interval tells the period of the following 
ticks.
