The only method the kernel now has to relocate userspace memory is IO.
When mlocked, or if anonymous when there's no swap, it's pinned.

Yes.

Userspace allocations can also trigger OOM, it's merely that in this
case only allocations restricted to ZONE_NORMAL or below, e.g. kernel
allocations, are affected. Your memory pressure is restricted to one zone.

In order to relocate a userspace page, the kernel performs IO to write
the page to some backing store, then lazily faults it back in later. When
the userspace page lacks a backing store, e.g. anonymous pages on
swapless systems, Linux does not now understand how to relocate them.
