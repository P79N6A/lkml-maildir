Hi All!
X - X windows system
K - Linux kernel
E - Events as well
INTRODUCTION
------------
    xke is userspace program which is capable read and recognize Linux
kernel generated events of input devices. xke translate Linux kernel
events and send to X windows system. Main goal is keyboar multimedia key
utilization.
    As input xke uses /dev/input/eventXX device files. As output xke uses
Xtst.so library alias Xtest extension.
    xke uses unified Linux input event system. xke don't care what input
device is connected in the box. From point of view of xke differs only
device name and some parmeters. So xke satisfactory works with keyboard,
mouse and tablet.
    xke can connect to local X server any time when end-user will do it,
because use Xtst library. End-user may start and stop xke during X sesion
and use user specific settings.
    Right now xke maps key press/release events to
generate key (key-press/release) series
launch programs
generate mouse motions
generate button-press/release
    Button press and x y axis motion events will be sended to X "unchanged".
xke is a merge and rewrite from the programs:
evdev XFree86 driver by Zephaniah E. Hull
xkeymouse by Henrik Sandklef
tuntiko XFree86 driver by Daniel Skarda
