Good, thanks for testing.

This is when I started seeing errors. Looks like if the next event from
next_timer_interrupt() is longer than HZ and idle HZ is very low, such
as 3 - 4 HZ, something gets confused.
I'll be looking into it more a bit later on, but until the problem
is solved, we should limit MAX_SKIP_TICKS to HZ/2.
