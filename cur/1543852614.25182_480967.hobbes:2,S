Well, it looks like quite a lot of drivers depend on them, including libata.
I think we can add a flag to __create_workqueue() that will indicate if
this one is to be running with PF_NOFREEZE and a corresponding macro like
create_freezable_workqueue() to be used wherever we want the worker thread
to freeze (in which case it should be calling try_to_freeze() somewhere).
Then, we can teach filesystems to use this macro instead of
create_workqueue().
Having done that we'd be able to drop the freezing of bdevs patch and forget
about the dm-related complexity.
[Still I wonder if the sys_sync() in freeze_processes() is actually safe if
there's a suspended dm device somewhere in the stack, because in the other
case the freezing of bdevs would be no more dangerous than the thing
that we're already doing.]
Greetings,
Rafael
