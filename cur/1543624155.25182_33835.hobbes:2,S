Ok, Oleg,
I re-checked the setup with all server fs as reiserfs 3.6 and the problem stays
the same.
Mar 11 13:05:07 admin kernel: reiserfs: checking transaction log (device 22:01)
...
Mar 11 13:05:09 admin kernel: Using r5 hash to sort names
Mar 11 13:05:09 admin kernel: ReiserFS version 3.6.25
What else can I try?
I checked the setup with another client kernel 2.4.18, and guess what: it has
the same problem. I have the impression that the problem is somewhere on the
nfs server side - possibly around the umount case. Trond, Ken?
Can anyone reproduce this? It should be fairly simple to check.
Regards,
Stephan
