And please see Documentation/hwmon/sysfs-interface for proper file

The "alpha order" point is moot. I see nothing about that in
Documentation/CodingStyle, and also no rationale for it. Header files
should work no matter the order of inclusion. And I don't think we have
a single driver respecting that rule, do we?
I do agree with the linux/asm/local ordering rule, though, and I think
pretty much everyone does, as there is a rationale for it (local
defines shouldn't possibly affect standard header files.)
I second every other point Randy made, and add the following ones:
8* Theuns' driver belongs to drivers/hwmon, not drivers/i2c/chips.
9* The driver should be submitted for review to the lm-sensors list
(see MAINTAINERS) rather than the LKML.
Thanks,
