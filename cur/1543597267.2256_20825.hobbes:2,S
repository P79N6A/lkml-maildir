I've found a 4th option.  We make it so that fs->umask does not affect
nfsd, just as the rest of the fs_struct has no effect on nfsd.
This means moving the " & ~current->fs->umask" up out of the vfs_*
routines and into the sys_* (or open_namei) routines.
The attached patch does this.
The only part that I'm not 100% confident of is the call to vfs_mknod
in net/unix/af_unix.c:unix_bind.  I haven't put an "& ~current->fs->umask"
there, as I suspect that is actually the right thing.  Any comments on
that?
Al, as this is a vfs change, I have cc:ed you.  Are you happy with it?
It allows nfsd to not be effected by any change the init might make to
umask.
This patch also puts the umask for init back to 0022.
