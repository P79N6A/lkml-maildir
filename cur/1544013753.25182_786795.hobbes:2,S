This has a technical ack from Paul, but what about Linus' long-standing 
objection to singly-linked lists in the kernel?  I'm sure this has been 
discussed re. your patches, but I can't find a reference.
Also, should this be folded into list.h, and is "list1" an appropriate 
name?  ("slist" might be better).
