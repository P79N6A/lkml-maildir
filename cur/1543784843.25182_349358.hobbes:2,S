Yes, but they can only support devices that can do 32 bit or above 
addressing due to the fact that their IOMMU page tables are only 
referenced if the high bit of a 32 bit address is set, iirc.
Anyway, for those boxes, all memory was put in the DMA zone and the I/O 
mapping routines failed if devices that didn't support at least 32 bits 
tried to do a DMA map.
