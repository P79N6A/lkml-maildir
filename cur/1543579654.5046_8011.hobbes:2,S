I hate to tell you this, but you couldn't be more wrong.  My MBR was 
fine.  Lilo was fine and ran fine.  The kernel even booted. The problem 
was my ext2 partition was scrambled but good (over 4 hours trying to fix 
it and answer all the questions that fsck threw out).  The ext2 drive 
lost a lot of data and suddenly had windows stuff all over it (yes, just 
like Mike, I had ttf fonts and other such things).
