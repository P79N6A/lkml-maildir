More like a disk that isn't strangely crippled.
(This kernel isn't getting anywhere near the studly machines :-)
The new-sysfs /sys/class/sound looks correct (I don't have any
userspace that can use it yet, simply compared it to pre-patch) and
the compatability (CONFIG_SYSFS_DEPRECATED) modes look and work 100%
properly here now.  Current hal works properly with
CONFIG_SYSFS_DEPRECATED and audio now.
