   NT Services for Macintosh actually implements 
   all resource-fork data in one stream, and provides 
   structured storage (prob. just a hash table, but I 
   don't really know) to do it in. It doesn't map 
   each EA to a separate stream. But, we'll play 
   your game for a moment. The correct answer is 
   B, "acox". It doesn't make sense to do anything
   but wipe out what is there and replace it when 
   doing EAs on top of named streams, with a 1:1 EA:NS 
   mapping. Leaving what is there and overwriting part of
   it isn't how EAs work, and isn't how EAs on NSes have
   to work.
So what you're saying is that the semantics of read() and write() change
depending on whether your filesystem supports Extended Attributes or
Named Streams.  Note that if "Creator" were a named stream, the answer
would be (A).  
Is this enough to convince you that trying to emulate Extended
Attributes in terms of Named Streams is terminally broken?!?  API's are
more than just the function signatures; they are also about semantics.
If the semantics change in a fundamental way depending on what kind of
filesystem you're dealing with, things are really broken.
The other question which this of course raises is what happens if a
filesystem has *both* named streams and extended attributes?  And in
fact, NTFSv5 (shipped with the W2K bug) does in fact have both.  This
should hopefully prove to you that Extended Attributes and Named Streams
are fundamentally different.
