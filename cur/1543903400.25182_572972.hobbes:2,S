It's not really in reverse.  It too marks a dependency in the same
direction as "depends on".  But the select statement additionally
instructs "make XYZconfig" programs to
  - expose the dependent option even if the required option is
    disabled,
  - silently enable the required option.
The latter is sometimes hard or impossible to satisfy.  Therefore the
select statement should be used with care, i.e. only for library-type
helper code which itself shouldn't depend on further options.
