The real problem I see with cmake is that you need to have cmake
installed on the build system. While cmake itself isn't the problem,
often, it also depends on the version of cmake that is installed. The
good idea about auto* tools is the idea that you don't need to install
any tools to build, just to develop. A POSIX shell and Perl should be
installed everywhere ...
Maybe the problem becomes less important in a few years if everyone
has cmake installed and it's more "stable" in terms of adding new
features.
Thanks,
