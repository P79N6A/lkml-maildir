Why do you need this device?  You shouldn't have a static struct device
to start with.  Or you just don't like having your root rio device
showing up in /sys/devices/ ?
If so, just create a kobject and put it there, and then base your
devices off of it, no need for a real device.
Oh wait, that's what the platform and system code does.  bah,
nevermind...
thanks,
