Subject: build requirements for 2.6.0 (make)

Dear Listreader,
the Documentation/Changes file suggest that make-3.78 is new enough to 
build the 2.6.0 kernel:
# grep "make --version"  Documentation/Changes 
o  Gnu make               3.78                    # make --version
I saw reproducable sig segv's with that make at my setup. I ran
the "make all" command in gdb which gave the following output
...
make[2]: Nothing to be done for `__build'.
/usr/local/bin/make -f scripts/Makefile.build obj=net/sunrpc
make[2]: Nothing to be done for `__build'.

    end=0xffffffff <Address 0xffffffff out of bounds>) at expand.c:417

this happend with make-3.78.
I assume that it only happens with certain environments (e.g. path lengths,
or number and length of enviroment variables and so on). I did not
track that further, but updated to make-3.80 (which is the most 
current release).
So I suggest to lift the requirement in the Documentation/Changes
file. It works here with make-3.80, maybe older version will
work also.
        hope this helps
        Joerg
