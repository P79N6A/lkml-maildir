Then this may have changed with SDRAM. However, back in my Amiga days it
was pretty common to just reset the machine and rip whatever was left in
the memory (DRAM). If memory serves me right, some people put in reset
protection (by pointing the reset vector to some code that cleared the
memory), which could be fooled by hardware reset or power cycling.
