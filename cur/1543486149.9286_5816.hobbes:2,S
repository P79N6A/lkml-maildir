Nope.  In C, the difference between two pointers is only defined IFF both
pointers point into the same array (counting the requirement that you can form
a pointer to the element 1 byte beyond the end of the array, but not derefernce
said pointer as being in the same array).  Thus if you have a limit on the size
of objects, ptrdiff_t can be smaller than the size of pointers.  In fact, in
early x86's, some of the memory models used by the compilers had 32 bit
pointers, but ptrdiff_t was 16 bits, since the object size was limited to be
65K-1 or less.
