You can only disable CONFIG_VM86 if you have set CONFIG_EMBEDDED=y.
That's OK considering that CONFIG_EMBEDDED=y has the semantics:
  Allow me to disable more options to save space no matter how much
  this can break since I do _really_ know what I'm doing when I'm 
  enabling CONFIG_EMBEDDED.
Expecting working kernels when randomly toggling options that get 
available with CONFIG_EMBEDDED=y is simply silly.
