   Also reading HPET is somewhat more costly than reading TSCs because it
   goes to the southbridge, so there are cases where using TSC is
   probably better (e.g. I think for networking packet time stamping the
   TSC is just fine with all its limitations)
The cpu gets a bus clock input, so the system tick should be processor
local as much as TSC is.
It's boggling that this is being messed up so much.  I can't believe
Sun got something incredibly right (Ultra-III has a system tick) :-)
