Sorry.  I meant that once I've merged this series into -mm, you can no

patch series out of next -mm, you'd have a clean tree to raise patches
against.

Replacement would be best.  If you can regenerate the diffs against
whatever tree you generated the last batch, that would work.

minimally-sized incremental fixes are preferred, please.

That would be good, thanks.
