There are three reasons (main reason is that vmware is 32bit app, but it is how
things are currently laid out; even if there will be 64bit app, 32bit versions are
already in use and people wants to use them on 64bit kernels):
* USB.  usbfs API is written in a way which does not allow you to safely wrap
it in "generic" 32->64 layer, and attempts to do it in non-generic way in usbfs
code itself did not look feasible year ago.  Even on current 64bit kernels it is not
possible to issue raw USB operations from 32bit apps, and I do not believe that
it is going to change - after all, just issuing ioctl through 64bit path from application
which is aware of 64bit kernel is quite simple, much simpler than any attempt to
make kernel dual-interface.
* parport interface, serial port:  not all APIs were implemented in kernel.  Current
kernels do wrap all APIs vmware needs, but older kernels do not, and so we had to find
some solution for older kernels too.  Not so surprisingly, solution we had in place for
USB works for them too...
* floppy:  it is actually different from examples above, as FDRAWCMD command is
supported by 32->64 layer, but it is supported incorrectly.  Due to this all above
started, as we had to make application aware of kernel it runs on, as FDRAWCMD on 32bit
kernel returns 80 byte structure, while 104 byte on 64bit kernel, and you do not now
which one you'll get until you call this ioctl...  And once we had code in place,
it was reused for USB and later for ppdev & serial.
So we added simple wrapper to vmmon which just gets {64bit-ioctl-number, 64bit-arg-argument}
and passes it down to 64bit sys_ioctl:
/* Use weak: not all kernels export sys_ioctl for use by modules */
#if LINUX_VERSION_CODE >= KERNEL_VERSION(2, 5, 66)
asmlinkage __attribute__((weak)) long
sys_ioctl(unsigned int fd, unsigned int cmd, unsigned long arg);
#else
asmlinkage __attribute__((weak)) int
sys_ioctl(unsigned int fd, unsigned int cmd, unsigned long arg);
#endif
...
static int
LinuxDriver_Ioctl3264Passthrough(unsigned int fd, unsigned int iocmd,
                                 unsigned long ioarg, struct file * filp)
{
   VMIoctl64 cmd;
   if (copy_from_user(&cmd, (VMIoctl64*)ioarg, sizeof(cmd))) {
      return -EFAULT;
   }
   if (sys_ioctl) {
      int err;
#if LINUX_VERSION_CODE < KERNEL_VERSION(2, 4, 26) || \
   (LINUX_VERSION_CODE >= KERNEL_VERSION(2, 5, 0) && LINUX_VERSION_CODE < KERNEL_VERSION(2, 6, 3))
      err = sys_ioctl(fd, cmd.iocmd, cmd.ioarg);
#else
      unlock_kernel();
      err = sys_ioctl(fd, cmd.iocmd, cmd.ioarg);
      lock_kernel();
#endif
      return err;
   }
   return -ENOTTY;
}
We were thinking about creating 64bit thread, and issuing 64bit syscalls from it, but 
it looked more fragile than code above.
