:) I cannot disagree. I probably shouldn't have actually stated that in
the document, since the cases in which that could happen are very rare -
hotplug devices that can survive a suprise removal..Those drivers are
special and (should they ever exist) will have to know to do
that. Consider it removed.

I agree. My main goal was to change probe() to be simple answer to the
question "Hey, are you there?", and move the init features out of it. 
In devices that support power management, that would happen anyway, so
anyway, so that resume() could re-init the device. 
I will update the code and the document to note that.
