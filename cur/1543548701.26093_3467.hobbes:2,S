hallo , 
To back up a linux source directory, I tried a $ cp -Rr /usr/src/linux2.2.5
/usr/src/2.2.5_New
and then I made the soft link to point to the new directory.
My question is why does 'make xconfig' or any 'make config' in the new
directory does not work ,even though the .config file is the same in the
original and the new one?
 The following errors are encountered.
    rm -f include/asm
   rm: include/asm: is a directory
   make: *** [symlinks] Error 1
But strange enough, make xconfig works in the original old kernel source
directory. 
Thanks !
