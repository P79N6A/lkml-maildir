Is NTP a case of "deliberately mangle your system clock"?
Summer- and wintertime is a question of timezones, but when the
NTP demon adjusts the system time, the BootID will shift too
(if I understood the problem correctly).
Not that I would touch EMACS with anything but a ten foot pole,
but incorrect values are incorrect values, and may confuse
other programs too.
An easy way could be a system patch which copies the system time
at boot into another variable, which is exported read-only via
"/proc/bootID" or something along that. IMHO no great deal.
