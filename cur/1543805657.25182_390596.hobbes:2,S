What code were you using that called debugfs?  Is it in the mainline
tree?
This works just fine for me right now:
$ uname -r
2.6.16-rc1-git4
$ mount | grep debug
none on /sys/kernel/debug type debugfs (rw)
$ cd /sys/kernel/debug/
$ find .
.
./uhci
./uhci/0000:00:1d.3
./uhci/0000:00:1d.2
./uhci/0000:00:1d.1
./uhci/0000:00:1d.0
$ find --version
GNU find version 4.3.0
Features enabled: D_TYPE O_NOFOLLOW(enabled) LEAF_OPTIMISATION FTS
