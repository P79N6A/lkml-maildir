I have a SIS based motherboard too, and it does it for me too, kind of.
Providing I do it via a PS/2 keyboard, via USB it does not happen.
Also, it does not shut down, just puts it in a power save mode.  You do
have APM enabled, right?
Apparently, this is a BIOS feature, but I have not managed to find out
what setting needs to be there to be able to poweroff via halt -p, but
not via this ctrl-alt-bs...  Maybe you want to play with it and report? :)

I was surprised too, but does not seem to be even Linux specific
either..
