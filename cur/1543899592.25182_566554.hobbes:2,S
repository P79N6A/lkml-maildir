Yes, a typo, sorry.

I don't think it would add much complexity to build process as it 
is now, just like the other tools that transparently do post-linking 
modifications. As far as the developer is concerned, there's just
the vmlinux and/or bzImage files that get emitted at the end.

Not exactly. Let me describe the procedure in greater detail.
Basically, it would go like this:
1. <normal bootloader boot>
2. <normal initramfs>
3. embed_configfile /proc/kcore.info /vmlinux-kdump
4. kexec -l vmlinux-kdump <....>
5. <boot continues>
6. <crash>
7. <kdump kernel boot>
8. <kdump initramfs runs>
9. makedumpfile -i /proc/vmcore.info <....>
NOTES:
** in step 3 embed_configfile modifies vmlinux-kdump in place, 
   copying /proc/kcore.info into the data section of the vmlinux-kdump 
   at certain symbol (e.g. 'char core_info[0x1000]').
** in step 9 that data section variable (e.g. core_info) which was 
   originally holds the content of /proc/kcore.info is being presented 
   as /proc/vmcore.info for the util to use.
To complete the picture, at the final build stage of vmlinux we 
would have this:
makedumpfile -g vmlinux.configfile -x vmlinuxx
embed_configfile vmlinux.configfile vmlinux
rm vmlinux.configfile
BTW I think there could be a confusion between makedumpfile's 
CONFIGFILE and the .config file, so we should pick a different 
name for it...
