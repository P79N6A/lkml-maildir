The vfs_ helper functions are the ones calling the lsm hooks in many cases. 
Any lsm that makes pathname based decisions will need both the dentry and 
vfsmount for figuring out a file's pathname. I don't see a better way of 
passing that information to the lsm hooks than passing it through the vfs_ 
helpers.
Thanks,
Andreas
