Yes. Files with the CLOFORK and CLOEXEC flag do not count for fork and 
exec copies.
I was also planning on doing it in __put_unused_fd(), every time 
fmap->count goes to zero. But get_random_int() is not as cheap as I 
thought. If we use a cheaper (although less secure) function to mix pid & 
jiffies, we could do it even in there.
