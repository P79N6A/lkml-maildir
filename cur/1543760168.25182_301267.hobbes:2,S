Yeah... fair enough.

There are two parts to the reason:
 (1) Keys are for the most part invariant. Whilst they can be modified if the
     type supports it, this should be uncommon. Except in the case of
     keyrings, that is, but they're a special case anyway.
 (2) Anything that accesses a key's payload (which includes the keyring search
     algorithm) must hold the key's spinlock whilst it is looking at it, for
     as long as it is looking at it.
     With RCU, this is no longer necessary. You just can't schedule until
     you've finished looking at it.
Given that for the most part keys don't change, it'd be very nice not to have
to get a read lock on them. For something like NFS or AFS, the key will
probably have to be accessed for every remote procedure call, for example; and
a process's keyrings will have to be searched on every open call, assuming
keys are associated with struct files or struct inodes.
The current locking model is quite complicated, and great care has to be taken
to avoid recursive deadlocks; so in some ways the RCU model is actually
simpler.

I need to update the key documentation to reflect the changes in locking, but
the base kernel doesn't have the previous sets of doc changes; something I'd
like to build on.
When you or Andrew have released such a kernel, I'll update the docs too.
