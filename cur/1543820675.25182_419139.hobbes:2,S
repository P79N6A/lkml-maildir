As one of my tests, I manually added the VM_PFNMAP flag before calling 
remap_pfn_range().  This did not resolve the issue.  Also, I checked the 
kernel source (vanilla Fedora Core 5) and VM_PFNMAP is always added inside 
remap_pfn_range() anyway, along with VM_IO & VM_RESERVED.
Note that the kernel oops I posted only happened rarely.  Most of the time, 
the system completely froze immediately when the file descriptor was closed 
and I didn't get any oops message.
