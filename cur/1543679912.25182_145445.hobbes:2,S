The problem is with a broken signal handler, that moves the stack
pointer to nirvana.  You get a signal, set up the signal stack, move
the pointer to nirvana, get a signal, set up the signal stack, move
the pointer to nirvana, get a signal, ...
If I was just going down the signal stack, I would be perfectly happy,
but instead the kernel believes each signal is the very first on the
signal stack and sets it up again (and again...) each time.

Sorry about that.
