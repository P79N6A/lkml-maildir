On second thought, not such a good idea, that will still be too course.
You only want to force feed stuff originating from
sk_has_vmio(iscsi_tcp_conn->sock->sk) connections, not all
connectections as soon as there is a swapper in the system.
In order to preserve that information you need extra state, abusing this
process flags is as good as propagating __GFP_EMERGENCY down the call
chain with extra gfp_t arguments, perhaps even better, since it will
make sure we catch all allocations.
