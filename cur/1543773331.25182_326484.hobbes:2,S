I have set hotplug to start on Slackware 10 (chmod a+x
/etc/rc.d/rc.hotplug) and it seems to start fine. When running the
default udev (v0.26) it loads all that I need for my external hard
disk except for sd_mod. If I manually modprobed sd_mod, /dev/sda and
/dev/sda1 would be automatically created, which was nice. With the
latest version of udev (v0.58) it loads sd_mod when I plug in the
drive, but /dev/sd** are not created dynamically (they are there all
the time). Having them created dynamically is nifty, but not necessary
for me. It would be nice if it was a little more brainless (e.g. /dev
entries are created on the fly by default) since I don't know how to
turn on/off dynamic creation of /dev entries.
Also, starting hotplug on boot gives a (slight) delay on my system.
This might be normal, but I'm not sure.
I'm probably not understanding something correctly, but this is what I'm seeing.
Thanks.
