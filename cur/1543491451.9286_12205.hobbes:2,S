The point here is that even with all the readahead in the world, the disk
is still the slowest part of the system. If you can reduce the about of
data (number of sectors) you need to get off of the drive you win. It
doesn't matter that they will then take up the same amount of space im
memory becouse memory is fast.
example
512 100 byte  (ave size) files
with the tarfs you have 
1 inode
~50 blocks (which are probably togeather as it is one file)
with ext2fs you have
512 inodes
512 blocks (which may be scattered as they are all seperate files)
so with tarfs you are reading 51 blocks rather then 1024 blocks a 20:1
advantage! (in real life milage will vary of course)
when reading this is a hugh advantage. when writing you need support at
the filesystem level (like reiserfs is doing) so that writes can be done
reasonably. (probably something along the lines of treat the files in
memory as normal files and they dn't get mashed back togeather until the
buffers are flushed and they get written back to disk)

make computers run, and not to make them happy, they can, in fact, be made
happy most of the time. If users are allowed to believe that the system
administrator's job is to make them happy, they can, in fact, never be made
