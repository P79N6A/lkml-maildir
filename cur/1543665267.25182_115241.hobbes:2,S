KABOOM!  Major explosions on boot.  First time I booted, I got an instant 
reboot.  Second time, I got a couple of double faults and then explosion 
during fsck (uhoh;).  PID is 1684368482 :-/
Time to reboot into .virgin for (hopefully) a couple of fretful 
moments.  (rebooting into .virgin after first explosion would have been a 
bit smarter;)
