When I suggested to Keith he push kbuild25 the way Linus likes, he (Keith) 
considered that was a "stupid comment" and that he'd ignore stupid comments.
So it looks like someone else will have to volunteer to split kbuild25 into
multiple small patches and feed them "piecemeal" to Linus before we ever see
it into the kernel tree.
