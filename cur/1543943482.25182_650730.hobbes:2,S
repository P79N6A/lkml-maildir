Christoph, I am not sure what you are saying here.  With v4 and later,
I thought we were able to use the rmap invalidation to remove the ref
count that XPMEM was holding and therefore be able to swapout.  Did I miss
something?  I agree the existing XPMEM does pin.  I hope we are not saying
the XPMEM based upon these patches will not be able to swap/migrate.
Thanks,
Robin
