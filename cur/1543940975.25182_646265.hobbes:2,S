but this linker script rule is about startup_64, not about startup_32.
startup_32 does exist on 64-bit too (and is 32-bit code), but it's 
linked to a different address that is not 0:
 ffffffff806c23c0 r startup_32
startup_64 is at offset 0:
 ffffffff80200000 T startup_64
So your patch looks wrong to me.
