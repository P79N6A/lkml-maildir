I'm running both 2.4.19-pre8 and 2.5.16, and, though both were compiled 
with gcc 3.1, I am having no problems.
Although I remember someone saying that gcc 3.1 produced larger 
binaries, and inefficient code in some places.
Also, gcc 3.1 generates lots of warnings because of things like 
multi-line string literals, etc.
