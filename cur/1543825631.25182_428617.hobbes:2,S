Ok so it was your bug. Don't do that.

No, Linux doesn't tolerate larger stacks.

In practice if you overwrite thread_info you crash eventually
and it's noticed.  If you write below thread_info but keep
ti intact then the redzone would likely not catch it either.
I don't think an additional red zone would improve overflow detection 
in a significant way.

If you have a working module it can be easily built in too.
Just hacks that don't work with modules are bad.
