No. I said that reporting bugs on RedHat-specific kernels should be
done to RedHat rather than to this list.
As for O_SYNC, AFAICS there are no bugs in the standard
kernel. However if you are thinking that O_SYNC means that you can
write simultaneously to the same file from 2 different clients, then
the answer is "the NFS protocol won't allow you to do that".
The *only* method of ensuring cache consistency in such a case is to
use POSIX file locking.
Cheers,
