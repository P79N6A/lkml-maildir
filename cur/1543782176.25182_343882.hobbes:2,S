VFAT is plenty good at killing hardware.  It's a terrible filesystem for
flash cards (if they don't do their own wear leveling properly).  Most
of the linux filesystems may not be any better but they are also no
worse.  Windows compatibility is completely irrelevant if the card is
being used as your root filesystem since any extensions you make to vfat
wouldn't be understood by windows anyhow, so at best it makes a mess of
it.

I run ext3 on CF and so far, no problems.  I run with noatime and try to
avoid writing in general as much as possible.  VFAT would be crap since,
well, I run linux on the system.
