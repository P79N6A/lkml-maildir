Hmm, what exactly goes wrong ? Do you hang while waiting for an interrupt
(e.g. in BogoMIPS calibration) or do you crash on parsing the SMP tables ?
See 
ftp://icaftp.epfl.ch/pub/people/almesber/misc/bootimg-8.tar.gz
 for how
you can solve the latter. (Actually, using the IO APIC on UP may already
do the trick - need to check.)
