With the atomic_dec_and_lock strategy, the page would be freed immediately on 
the buffers being released, and with the lru=1 strategy it doesn't matter 
in terms of correctness whether the page ends up on the lru or not, so I was 
inclined not to worry about this anyway, still, when you a dire-looking 
comment like that...
You said something about your lru locking strategy in 2.5.33-mm2.  I have not
reverse engineered it yet, would you care to wax poetic?
