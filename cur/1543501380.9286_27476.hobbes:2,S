   There is what I would consider to be a minor logic error in the handling
   of immutable in ext2's code.
   Now that setting/removal of immutable/append only is a specific
   capability, there is no reason user "fred" shouldn't be given this
   capability so he can manage immutable/append only flag on his _own files_.
   Unfortunately the current implementation allows processes with
   CAP_IMMUTABLE to manipulate these flags on _any_ file.
   Patch follows - Alan if you agree with the change in logic please apply to
   next -ac patch? It's against ioctl.c in ext2 directory.
These seems reasonable to me.  It doesn't change the behaviour of
non-capability systems, since root will have both CAP_IMMUTABLE and
CAP_FOWNER, so it can change the immutable flag on any file, and
in a non-capability system non-root processes will have neither
CAP_IMMUTABLE or CAP_FOWNER, so they won't be able to change the
immutable flag.
The patch allows someone to only be able to change the immutable flag on
their own files if they have CAP_IMMUTABLE, which seems like a
reasonable thing to do.  It should get applied to the 2.3 tree, and
perhaps to the 2.2 tree (it really isn't a bug fix as much as it is a
new feature, although it's fairly low risk as new features go).
