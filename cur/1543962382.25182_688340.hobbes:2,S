He reported it as
[BUG] 2.6.25-rc2-git4 - Regression Kernel oops while running kernbench and tbench on powerpc
and it was in the 2.6.25 regression lists for ages.

No general disagreement on this.
And my example was not in any way meant against you - it's actually 
unusual and positive that a bug that once got the attention of being
on the regression lists gets fixed later.
Even worse is the situation with regressions people run into when 
upgrading from 2.6.22 to 2.6.24 today...  :-(
