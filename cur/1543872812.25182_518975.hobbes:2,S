Yes I recall a talk by Keith Packard on Xorg development and how a heck of a 
lot of time spent spinning by X (?Xlib) for no damn good reason was the 
number one thing that made X suck and basically it was silly to try and fix 
that at the cpu scheduler level since it needed to be corrected in X, and was 
being actively addressed. So we should stop trying to write cpu schedulers 
for X.
