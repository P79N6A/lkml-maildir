You should really take care about your words. You've not written any
technical reason to say these sentences. We are not aware about any
problems against low-latency. Sure, OSS API emulation is only emulation,
so there is additional layer which can be a bit slower than simplified
native OSS drivers, but using ALSA API, we get really serious latencies
even for multichannel hardware.
I propose to join to our efford and fix (or at least - point to) problems 
(if any) in ALSA drivers. Thanks.
