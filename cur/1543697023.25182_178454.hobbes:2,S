I think they used 2.5.69. Their list includes net/bridge/br_if.c, and
patch 2.5.69 adds code containing the word "rcu", which is probably
one of the keywords they searched for. The following script generates
a list very close to SCOs list:
#!/bin/sh
# to be run in the linux-2.5.69 kernel tree
(
  find * -name '*.[ch]' |
  egrep -v '^(drivers|sound)|(arch/|include/asm-)(sparc|alpha|parisc)' |
  xargs egrep -iwl '(smp|numa|rcu)'
  ls fs/jfs/*.[ch]
) |
sort -u
The only files not on SCOs list are:
arch/um/drivers/harddog_kern.c
arch/um/drivers/harddog_user.c
arch/um/drivers/mconsole_kern.c
include/asm-h8300/smplock.h
