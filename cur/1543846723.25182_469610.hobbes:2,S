No, the solution I wanted to evaluate, is "chmod 'go-x' ld.so".
For that to work, something like this is needed:
http://uwsg.ucs.indiana.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0609.3/2322.html
Then you can't invoke ld.so directly and if you happen to
have "noexec" on all the writeable mounts, then you can't
also use your own ld.so.

Of course if ld.so would check /proc/mounts, then it will
do so also for the shared libs, so LD_PRELOAD won't trick it.
I understand that parsing /proc/mounts is silly (I have
admitted that earlier in that thread already), but why not to
at least check the access(X_OK)? ld.so _must_ check access(X_OK)
before executing - why not yet?
Oh wait, access(X_OK) doesn't seem to work...
The attached patch is needed to get it working.
Does the patch look good? I think it was just a bug.

Why not having an exec perm on a file doesn't prevent PROT_EXEC then?
In any case, guys, can the attached patch be applied?
Arjan, it enforces "noexec", just as you wanted to see. :)
Please say "no" now, not when I mail it to Andrew, if possible.
