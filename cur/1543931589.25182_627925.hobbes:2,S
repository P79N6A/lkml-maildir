Uhm, I haven't had to tell udev to not crap up any of my *other*
devices, why is b43 special? I'm using an up-to-date userspace, so I'm
not going to be the only one hitting this problem. And ifconfig -a
does indeed show it, sorry about that. But my understanding is that
udev renames interfaces based on MAC address, so I wouldn't suspect
udev to be at fault here.
Digging a little farther into it, it looks like b43 is barfing partway
through init as the firmware file it's looking for has changed names.
Perhaps that's the issue. I'll take a longer look at this all
tomorrow.

Well, it only hit the main kernel October 10th. That means no final
point release of the kernel.org kernel has even had it included! So
testing-wise, you still haven't hit the hordes yet. Scheduling a
removal of bcm43xx (as painful as that code is [*]), seems either
premature or very optimistic. So, how about scheduling the removal
once you get a feel for the bug reports that'll come in once 2.6.24 is
released.
   [*] Yeah, even as a user the code is painful. It *still* locks my
keyboard if I happen to disable the wireless while it's scanning. The
sooner bcm43xx is dead, the better. But b43 is quite obviously not a
full replacement for everyone.
I don't mean to come off harsh, I know you put an amazing amount of
work into both b43 and bcm43xx, and I'm thankful for that. But
requiring the end-user to go scan bcm43xx-dev archives to find out
that the b43 module isn't correctly autoloading all of its
dependencies is a sign that the code still hasn't had a lot of
testing, no?
In the meantime I'll keep plugging away at trying to figure out what's wrong.
