Well, if that's true, you should change your idle function not to
explicitly call schedule().
I haven't really understood how you preempt the idle task, but
I guess you can simplify the standard
| while (1) {
|	while (!need_resched())
|		asm("idle");
|	schedule();
| }
to 
| while (1)
| 	asm("idle");
