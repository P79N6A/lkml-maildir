IMHO something really fishy's going on there. If I explicitely write data
into the pool, it shouldd not stay at "zero", from wwhat I understood about
how /dev/*random work.

Well, they do, block device operations do, using the function
add_blkdev_randomness, as far as I know.

I know, and running on deterministically computed random values only for
days in a row is no situation I'm paticularily happy about...
I'm mainly wondering why writing stuff to /dev/*random does not change the
entropy from zero to at least any low non-zero value...
