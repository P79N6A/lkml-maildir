Not clearly, but try the following:
Configure your Kernel and then add in the Toplevel-Makefile
(/usr/src/linux/Makefile) an "extra-Subrevision", e.g. 
-------
VERSION = 2
PATCHLEVEL = 4
SUBLEVEL = 3
EXTRAVERSION = -12-TEST
 
KERNELRELEASE=$(VERSION).$(PATCHLEVEL).$(SUBLEVEL)$(EXTRAVERSION)
---------
Then compile.
The effect is, that now all the module-path and revision-numbers contain
this extra-info and you can easily track were the "right" modules are
stored and build.
Before you do a "make modules_install", delete the complete old
Module-Path (save the modules in another place if your are unsure), so
even the path has to be made new.
I had already strange problems with "make modules_install" not
overwriting old modules or deleting old ones that are not used any more.

If you have "/" on a SCSI-Disk, you cannot boot and then load the
module...you would have to build a initrd-ramdisk, but i would suggest
to build in the SCSI-Support.
If you have "/" on an IDE-Drive you can build the SCSI-Support as Module
and then load it during bootup.
Solong..

Microsoft isn't the answer.
Microsoft is the question, and the answer is NO.
