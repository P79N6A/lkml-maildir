I just checked SuS and they do not list SHM_LOCK as command at all.

Yes.

Yes.

So Irix does something quite different. For Irix SHM_LOCK is a special
version of mlock...

I think the VM_LOCKED approach is the best: 
- SuS does not specify anything, the different vendors do different
  things. So people using SHM_LOCK have to be aware that the details
  differ.
- Technically this is the fastest approach for attached segments: We
  do not scan the relevent vmas at all and by doing so we keep the
  overhead lowest. And I do not see a reason to use SHM_LOCK besides
  performance.
BTW I also have a patch appended which bumps the page count. Works
also, is also small, but we will have a higher soft fault rate with
that.
Greetings 
                Christoph
