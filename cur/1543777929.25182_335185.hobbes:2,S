Ok, you're right. I will have a look at the pipe buffer stuff.

Hmm, sendfile() uses do_generic_mapping_read() which is calling the 
file_send_actor() per page. The actor calls ->sendpage(). I don't see 
any situation how this could lead to uninterruptible kernel work when 
the sendpage() itself is checking for signals. There are only 2 pages in 
flight in this case.
