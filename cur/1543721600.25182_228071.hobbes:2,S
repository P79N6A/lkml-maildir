Care to mention sources? I'd be surprised if they did simply because
it'll cost money that could be earned otherwise. Also I think you
confuse bad block remapping with wear leveling and even the former
I haven't experienced so far.
CF disks were designed for simply the reason of having an empty disk,
writing data onto it up to a certain level, reading it a few times
and emptying the disk again. So except for the organizational blocks
and "the end" of a disk which tends to get rarely hit there're a
well distributed write utilization.
