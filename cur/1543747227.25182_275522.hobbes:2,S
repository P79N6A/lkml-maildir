Hello,
I am writing a Linux USB blog in
http://www.livejournal.com/users/usblog.
It reflects an on going research on Linux USB
subsystem.
I posted till now 4 blogs, and I intend to post
about 3 or 4 times a week. It deals with Linux USB layer.
It is not a professional research ,but you might find it interesting.
You are invited to attend this blog; any remarks/comments/thoughts will be
welcomed.
It is In fact taken from 
http://www.livejournal.com/users/rrx;
http://www.livejournal.com/users/rrx
 deals with Linux at large,
while 
http://www.livejournal.com/users/usblog
 is the part of RRX blog which
deals soleley with Linux USB).
Cheers,
  USBLOG
