ok, after the Nth time of shipping my laptop back to depot, i've gotten a
motherboard back that seems to spaz with IDE DMA.
when i compile IDE DMA into my kernel, it starts booting then locks up when
checking the first partition of hda.  it prints '..lost interrupt' then it
locks up hard.  i have to power cycle to get it back.
this is very VERY similar to the problem i had before i shipped it to depot
(btw, i shipped it because it overheated from being on the carpet :() which
was i would get the above, i.e. lost interrupt and hard lockup, about five
seconds after resuming from suspend.
today i have tried 2.2.12, 2.2.13, 2.2.14, 2.3.22, 24, 26, 27, 29, 32, and
33.
currently i'm running IDE w/out DMA, PIIX4: (trimmed dmesg)
Linux version 2.3.33 (root@Huntington-Beach) (gcc version pgcc-2.95.1

right up there is where it would explode.  it's an AMI BIOS, if someone has
tools to grab more info or wants to peek into the machine, hollar at me.
ideas? comments? flames for the burgers?
