I'm not entirely familiar with the issues surrounding lvm development, I know
things
are not in good shape right now.
But I would say the following statement is unrealistic.
Trying to manage a large software project without source code control is
an even bigger nightmare than with source code control.
patch is NOT a source code control tool.
In fact a good source code control system would allow patch incremental
generation,
This is actually one glaring limitation of CVS, the ability group a set of
changes
together, aka "mod"
(Bitkeeper has addressed a lot of these issues; it can generate or accept
incremental
patch sets)
The lvm problems seems to be more of wetware issue than a source code
control tool issue.
Hopefully XFS will be able to keep ahead the problem of dramatically
diverging
code bases by staying active with Linus's releases.
