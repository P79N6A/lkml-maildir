True. but perhaps we can embarrass these people into fixing *their* bugs
by logging such buggy interactions via the system's logs. Something like
printk("Barf! host a.b.c.d <insert your most hated operating system here>
sending broken packets"). If enough people notice the complaints in the
system logs, and scream... well... one can only live in hope. 8)
