Sure it will. Like this:
1. you're a user, possibly root, on your own machine
2. you zero the disk blocks of a file
3. somebody cracks root
4. they look for the file -- not there
5. they read /dev/hda to find the data -- not there
6. they modify the kernel -- nope, data still not there
As long as nobody physically opens the drive, it would take some
seriously bad luck involving bad sectors to make your data at all
vulnerable... to somebody with drive manufacturer trade secrets.
If this worries you, destroy the drive and/or make an appointment
with your mental health professional.
Nothing counts if root is already malicious, so that issue
wasn't being addressed. You'd have keyboard snooping,
encryption tools that save a copy, man-in-the middle attacks
on everything... forget it. It's not worth discussing.
