libata configures most of the stuff, so I don't think we'll see big
surprises even if we skip SRST during probing but I agree that it's nice
to give good kicks in the devices' asses during probing.
We can try IDENTIFY/IDENTIFY_PACKET with short timeout first and then
issue reset if the device isn't in reset blacklist, but it would make
probe sequence....
 IDENTIFY -> reset -> IDENTIFY -> configure -> IDENTIFY for reval
Which doesn't seem too attractive.  We can use the result from the first
IDENTIFY for configuration but it's probably a good idea to re-read
IDENTIFY page after reset.
It would be best if we can handle these braindead SRST-impaired devices
in the common code, if that's not feasible, we should at least provide
some option to allow correct (without timeout) detection of these devices.
Thanks.
