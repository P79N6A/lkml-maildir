Thanks.  Unfortunately I do not think that NCPFS will switch to 
backing_dev_info - it uses pagecache only for symlinks and directories, 
and even if it would use pagecache, as most of servers refuse concurrent 
requests even if TCP is used as a transport, there can be only one 
request in flight...

P.S.:  And if anyone wants to step in as ncpfs maintainer, feel free.  I 
did not see NetWare server for over year now...
