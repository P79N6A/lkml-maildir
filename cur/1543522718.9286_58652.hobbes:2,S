Hmm, your card has another chipset, so I'm not so much surprised that
you are not able to reproduce the problem. I haven't seen chip DP83840
in eepro100 before, I am dealing only with i8255X.

Local 10 Mbps network (computers connected to hubs, hubs connected to
switches, switches have 100 MBps uplink to the backbone), AMD K6-2/450
uploading at full speed of that poor 10 MBps net. I get transmit errors
during uploading of first 10 megabytes  of data via FTP regullary, then
error occur every 1 megabyte or so. I tested it against a lot of different
NICs, problems survive all the time.
I never had any kind of problems with this setup with 2.2.14. Actually now
I am running 2.2.15pre2 with eepro100.c from 2.2.14 and I am having no
problems too.
