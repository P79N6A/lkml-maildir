I sent this patch to linux-dvb-maintainer (linux-dvb is useless for me 
since it requires subscription) and if someone knows a more recent email 
address of Alex Woods my patch is equivalent to the question you

I'm sending small patches for many different areas of the kernel, and I 
do not plan to subscribe to 100 different subscribers-only mailing
