And those of us who tried it and decided that it's the wrong solution to a
set of non-problems think otherwise.

What /dev admin maintenance?  Perhaps my machines don't have enough disks,
but I have never needed to perform significant work in /dev.
Another spin: if/when we see ACLs in the kernel/ext[23] I could easily
find uses for them in /dev.  Will devfs support ACLs at least as soon as
ext2?
