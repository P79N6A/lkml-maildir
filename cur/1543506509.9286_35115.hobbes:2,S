Do you have the lowlevel block interface between Linux and M-Systems?
Will you GPL it and submit it?
Since M-Systems currently has the only know API to the kernel and no plans
to GPL that which is not theirs..........The DiskOnChips support as an IDE
block device, just is not going to happen.
Complain to them and not me.....
Now, if you have a version that can be submitted....WOOHOO!!!
