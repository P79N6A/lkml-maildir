No it isn't, because the end result would still be the same
for most systems:  this code would almost NEVER be executed.
All systems built in the past few years now use DMA transfers
for the IDE bus, completely bypassing the multwrite code.
The disable/enable is just to continue doing what we have
been doing all along, but is only needed with older chipsets
that cannot do DMA.
