If its one process running out of its fd allocation:
2.0.x you get the 3000fd patch from www.kernelnotes.org or similar places.
For 2.2.x if you get the ac patches you get the ability to run large arrays
per process. The select and other stuff applies.
If (as I suspect) its over the system, you stick bigger numbers into 
/proc/sys/file-max and /proc/sys/inode-max and you don't have to worry about
anything else
