Hate to say it but 2.5 is not ready for any kind of production use, and
some people really need to connect more SCSI devices than are currently
supported. That's NOT ivory tower, it's real world "do it with Linux"
problem solving.
If you have a "do it right" solution which is stable, for a stable kernel,
please let us know. This isn't a theoretical problem.
