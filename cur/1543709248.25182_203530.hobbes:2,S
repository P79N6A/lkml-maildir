The IT person should be beaten for shipping KGDB on a production system?
:)
Regardless, it's not that we offer (nor does the -mm version, from what
I read of it) eth or serial at any point, it simply allows for serial to
be used and a switchover to eth.  And if kgdb is attached at the time,
it's a 'fun' gdb session (or at least is was when I was trying it out in
-mm and then in my own version).
The real problem is that you start getting quite complex when you allow
for a system to be kgdb eth, or 8250, or some arch serial driver, or
some other I/O driver, and so on.  PPC has 3, and I don't see it getting
smaller from there.
And with both of those points, I don't think it's worth the trouble that
point 2 is, given the limitations of point 1.
