Subject: [PATCH] Generated files destruction
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Linus, please apply.
	I would like to start migrating all build-generated files to
names matching "generated*" or ".generated*", esp. those which look
like source files.  This is mainly for readability and for simplicity
when diffing built kernel trees.  I'll be encouraging various
maintainers who generate (.c, .h and .s) files which are not meant to
be shipped with the kernel source to migrate, in my copious free
time...
Cheers!
Rusty.
