squid needs a deep rewrite, and the sponsor for our doing that is flaking
regarding sending us money, so for now I have to say to people that even
though reiserfs is faster for squid than ext2, the bottleneck is squid not
reiserfs, and you really should use the proprietary stuff because the
proprietary guys have taken squid, rewritten its engine which is badly
designed, stolen the gpl code, and nobody is suing them for it and they are
so much faster than squid that the cost of the software is worth paying for
(unless you dislike stolen gpl code:-(, and even then there are some like
Novell that didn't steal from squid and are faster).
