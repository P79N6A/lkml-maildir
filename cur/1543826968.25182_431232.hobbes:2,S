Here's a patch.  I haven't tested it beyond compiling it, and I don't 
know if it is actually correct.  In this case, it seems pointless to 
spin waiting for an even which will never happen.  Should 
netif_poll_disable() cause netpoll_send_skb() (or something) to not even 
bother trying to send?  netif_poll_disable seems mysteriously simple to me.

Subject: netpoll: don't spin forever sending to stopped queues
When transmitting a skb in netpoll_send_skb(), only retry a limited
number of times if the device queue is stopped.
