That's...not a completely crazy idea.  Hmmm...
It might be possible to take a CML2 rulebase and generate a sort of stupid
jackleg CML1 translation of it.  The resulting config.in would be huge
and nasty, and would only work in forward sequence with no side-effect
computation, but you just might be able to get the old tools to parse it.
Again there's a technical problem with derivations.   Probably solvable.
But the real question is whether the old tools have enough value to be
worth the effort.  What problem are you trying to solve here?
