In FC class 3 if you are logged into a port then notice of this loss
doesn't happen until a upper level timeout occurs (ULTP?). The loss can
happen prior to the command reaching the device (i.e. the switch can
drop the frame). If a corrupted frame makes it to the device it will be
discarded as there is not much it can do with a frame containing unreliable
data. In FC class 2 frames are ack'd so the recovery can be much more
responsive.
