I'd recommend turning on scsi logging; it might give you a clue about
which bit of scanning is failing to work properly.
Try booting with scsi_mod.scsi_logging_level = 448 (I think I have that
number right; 7 shifted left by 6) and then you can compare failing and
non-failing runs and see if there's any difference.
