Never used powerpoint.  If I need slides I use a (linux-based) word
processor and a bigger font than for paper.  Or html if I need something 
more fancy than text.  Html works great, and is also nifty if I need to 
put the stuff on the web for later reference.  No conversion needed,
and readers don't need anything but the browser they're using.
