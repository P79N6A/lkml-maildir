Why not?
The whole point is running a system that you know you can support for many years,
even without a vendor support...
And to have a system that you know exactly what running in it...
Having a binary closed source violate this.
Also there is no good reason why supplying this daemon as closed source... All they
wish is people don't mess with their frequencies, and sooner or later someone will...
