Brain farting, delete it ;) This is a nice page about POLLHUP treatment :

Yes, this could be improved though. If we could only pass our event
interest mask to f_op->poll() the function will be able to register it
inside the wait queue structure and release only waiters that matches the
available condition.

Please replace 'it may hung' with 'it may hung if it is using the read()
return bytes check trick' ;)
