Dear Alan,
I am probably missing something, but access to both /dev/3dfx and (e.g.)
/dev/mem is controlled by filesystem permission rules. Writing garbage to
either will crash the entire machine. Why is one a security hazard and
another is not?
I think having 3dfx in the official kernel is a good idea - think about
it, if you have a 3dfx card you *will* install 3dfx module, be it
hazardous or otherwise. If you do not have 3dfx hardware it is silly 
to compile the driver when configuring the kernel, thus all hazards
avoided automatically.
But, as I said, Alan is always right, so I am merely curious
as to what am I missing here. 
Regards,
Tigran.
