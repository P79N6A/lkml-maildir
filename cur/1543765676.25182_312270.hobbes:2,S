But without the proper capability, root _can't_ change the immutable
bit.  Of course, that also applies to DAC checks too.  Personally, I
find the immutable bit most useful at preventing accidents.  I have
several scripts designed specifically to access the same file, and I
want to prevent one of my admins from accidentally editing that file
by hand.  The best way is with a big comment in the file itself and
the immutable bit.
