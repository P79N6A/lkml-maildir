Subject: [PATCH] trivial little type correction in mm/filemap.c::wait_on_page_writeback_range
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This patch changes the variable 'i' in 
mm/filemap.c::wait_on_page_writeback_range from 'unsigned int' to int.
The only use of 'i' is in the for loop, and the array being indexed is 
PAGEVEC_SIZE in size (and with PAGEVEC_SIZE being 14, an int is fully 
sufficient) and in the loop itself 'i' is being compared to 'nr_pages' 
which is defined as 'int' at the top of the function. So, as far as I can 
see changing 'i' to int makes sense - it is more than large enough for 
what it's used for, it then matches the type it is compared against 
exactely and it avoids a signed vs unsigned comparison.
