C++ in the kernel is a BAD IDEA. C++ code can be written in such a 
convoluted manner as to be unmaintainable and unreadable.
All of the hidden memory allocations from constructor/destructor 
operatings can and do KILL OS PERFORMANCE. Java
is a great example as to why kernel OS code should NEVER be allowed in C++.
C and C++ really show their origins when used in kernel level 
programming. So what were C and C++ originally -- they were grades. :-)
I applaud the LKML folks pushing back on C++.
A++.
