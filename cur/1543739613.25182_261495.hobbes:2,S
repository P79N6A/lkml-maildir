Tainted??? Tainted to what. The stated reason for having module-
license strings in kernel modules was to save developers from
having to locate "bugs" that were caused by proprietary modules
for which there was no source-code available. Now, you say that
if somebody were to review publicly-available source-code, they
become tainted?  This is unmitigated political bullshit.

Because it doesn't allow "BSD"!  Also, even my mailer doesn't
