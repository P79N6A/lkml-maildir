Hello!
What the last next-trees already showed is now confirmed in -rc7:
Suspend works, on resume the system freezes (screen is partly drawn).
Xorg is always running, without xorg it works on most of the recent kernels.
Working version:
2.6.28-rc6
2.6.28-rc6-wl-21906-g24e8b9a (running this right now)
Crashing versions (at least):
next-20081125
next-20081127
next-20081201
next-20081202
2.6.28-rc7
Just wondering what happened between those versions that it does not work anymore.
Sincerly,
Nico
