The functionality went there, not the actual file.  The file is obsolete
now :)

'ls <wherever_you_mounted_driverfs>/bus/usb/drivers' will now show you
all of the registered USB drivers.  As for what the minor numbers are
for the drivers that happened to use the USB major number, I'm working
on that.

Sorry, but I'm not going to put the file back.  I understand your
concerns.  We should have some kind of program (lsdev like) that shows
the system information present at that moment in time.  It will be able
to provide what the /proc/bus/usb/drivers file showed in the past.
