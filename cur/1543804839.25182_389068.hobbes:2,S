Ext3 doesn't require a fsck under normal circumstances.  The only
reason why it still requires a periodic fsck after some number of
mounts is sheer paranoia about the reliability of PC class hardware.
All filesystems need some kind of filesystem consistency checker to
deal with filesystem corruptions caused by OS bugs or hardware
corruption bugs.  The only question is whether or not the filesystem
assumes at a fundamental level whether or not the hardware can be
trusted to be reliable or not.  (People have claimed that XFS is much
less robust in the face of hardware errors when compared to ext[23]; I
haven't seen a definitive study on the issue, although that tends to
correspond with my experience.  Other people would say it doesn't
matter because that's why you pay $$$$$ for am EMC Symmetrix box or an
IBM shark/DS6000/DS8000, or some other Really Expensive Storage
Hardware.)
But if you're willing to assume that your hardware is reliable and
never fails, hey, feel free to disable the periodic FSCK checking
using the command: "tune2fs -c 0 -i 0 /dev/sdXXX".
