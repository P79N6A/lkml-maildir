Sounds like the eepro100 is the common factor in 3 cases of this bug
I've seen so far. I'll just go through the entire config.

(odd that the bogomips are different on each processor even though the
mhz are the same)

Yes, this machine acts as our transparent squid server and also hosts a
few high-traffic web sites. However the machine died at 5:30 AM, which
is an odd time for most people to be accessing this machine. 
This box was stable, it just recently started to crash with 2.2.x's with
this particular error, so it seems to be a kernel problem as far as I
can tell.
