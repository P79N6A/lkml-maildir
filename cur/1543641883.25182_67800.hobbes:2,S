Whoops, yes, I'm wrong. Sorry. My fixes wasn't enough. However, looks
like your case called the following BUG().
sys_ptrace()
    -> ptrace_attach()
        -> __ptrace_link()
void __ptrace_link(task_t *child, task_t *new_parent)
{
	if (!list_empty(&child->ptrace_list))
		BUG();
	if (child->parent == new_parent)
		BUG();		<--- this
	list_add(&child->ptrace_list, &child->parent->ptrace_children);
	REMOVE_LINKS(child);
So, I need to look source more. Thanks.
