I hit the send button to fast..
The dynamic irq limiting (it must not be set by a system admin to conserve
the principle of work) could be used as a last resort. The point is, if
you are not generating a lot of interupts to begin with (as is the case
with NAPI), i dont see the irq rate limiting kicking in at all. Maybe for
broken drivers and perhaps for other devices other than those within the
network subsystem (i think weve pretty much taken care of the network
subsystem). But you must fix the irq sharing issue first and be
able to precisely isolate and punish the rude devices.
cheers,
