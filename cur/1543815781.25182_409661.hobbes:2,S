You'd have to ensure that none of the threads involved are able to grab
new posix locks in the period between the unsharing of current->files to
the moment when current->files->owner is swapped.
If not, one thread could in theory open a new file and grab a lock that
can never be unlocked because its lockowner gets stolen away from it by
another execing thread.
