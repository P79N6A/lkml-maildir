I have no huge problem with changing my terminology in the interest of
wider adoption. "Container" seems like an appropriate name for the
abstraction, and possibly more appropriate than for a virtual server,
but if it was decreed that the only thing stopping the container patch
being merged was that it should be called, say, "Process Sets", I
would happily s/container/pset/g across the entire patchset.
