Ahm. That's file_read_actor, not file_write_actor ;-)

But there is another problem:
The tlb preloading with a simple 'mov' is not enough:
the Pentium III cpu decodes the 'mov', begins to load the tlb entry -
this will take at least several dozend cpu ticks.
But the cpu continues to decode further instructions. It sees the
'prefetchnta', notices that the tlb entry is not loaded and ignores the
next prefetchnta's (prefetch without tlb is turned into NOP).
