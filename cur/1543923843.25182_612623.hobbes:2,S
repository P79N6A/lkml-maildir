I suspect most of the panics you cited are unnecessary and should
be revisited anyways. Linux should be far beyond the "we left out error
handling and put in panic instead" philosophy of classical Unix now
and those are mostly just some left overs.  But that's a different issue.

You mean never. You want the change, you do it please properly the first
time. Doing stack dumps on no root or machine check is utterly wrong.
It is bad enough we always get them on OOM events where they are also
mostly pointless.
