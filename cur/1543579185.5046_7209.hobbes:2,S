Merely following the discussion a thought occurred to me of how
to make fd allocation fairly efficient (and simple) even if it retains
the O(n) structure worst case.  I don't know how it is currently implemented
so this may be how it is done, or I may be way off base.
First, keep a table of FDs in sorted order ( mark deleted entries )
that you can access quickly.  O(1) lookup.
Then, maintain this struct like
struct
{
	int lowest_fd;
	int highest_fd;
}
open:
	if( lowest_fd == highest_fd )
	{
		fd = lowest_fd;
		lowest_fd = ++highest_fd;
	}
	if( flags == IGNORE_UNIX98 )
	{
		fd = highest_fd++;
	}
	else
	{
		fd = lowest_fd
		lowest_fd = linear_search( lowest_fd+1, highest_fd );
	}
close:
	if( fd < lowest_fd )
	{
		lowest_fd = fd;
	}
	else if( fd == highest_fd - 1 )
	{
		if( highest_fd == lowest_fd )
		{
			lowest_fd = --highest_fd;
		}
		else
		{
			highest_fd;
		}
	}
For common cases this would be fairly quick.  It would be very easy to
implement an O(1) allocation if you want it to be fast ( at the expense
of a growing file handle table. )
Just thinking about it.
