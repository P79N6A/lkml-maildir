why not port one of the twenty or thirty preexisting tools
that let you mount a filesystem from an encrypted file instead
of making a generic layer?  That way you could have inter-os 
portability.  The steganographic ones make really impressive
claims.  
Does linux have a truly generic plug-in file system module yet,
or are people still hacking around fake nfs servers?
