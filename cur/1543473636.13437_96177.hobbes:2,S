	You don't want to use that version of the tulip driver. It is
quite old as well, and according to an archived post on the tulip mailing
list (from Don Becker), the version on there simply inserts some nasty
timing delays that can halt the kernel for an unacceptably long time.
	No, much better to get Don's proper PNIC fixes to work with kernel
2.2.x
