Just read this on full disclosure:
http://isec.pl/vulnerabilities/isec-0013-mremap.txt
Is it valid?  No working proof of concept code has been posted so I can't 
test my systems.  The article only lists 2.4 and 2.6.  Is this
2.4.16-current, etc?  Anyone have any details about versions that are
safe so I/We can determine if I need to roll a new production kernel out
again?
Thanks,
  Robert
