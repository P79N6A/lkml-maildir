xorg from debian testing or from ubuntu already support multiple
independent keyboards.  I'm using that right now for my
two-user single-pc setup.
Each independent xserver have a section like this in the xorg.conf:
Section "InputDevice"
        Identifier      "Generic Keyboard"
        Driver          "kbd"
        Option          "Protocol"      "evdev"
        Option          "Dev Phys"      "isa0060/serio0/input0"
        Option          "CoreKeyboard"
        Option          "XkbRules"      "xfree86"
        Option          "XkbModel"      "pc102"
        Option          "XkbLayout"     "no"
EndSection
In the serverlayout section, use the IsolateDevice option so
the independent xservers don't stomp on each other's cards.
In the screen section, set the "InitPrimary" option for cards that
doesn't get initialized by the bios at bootup.
In the device section, use the BusID option to be safe.
Start your xserver with the -sharevts option.
I have only one _console_, but multiple xservers with
separate keyboards works with plain 2.6.13.
Multiple consoles are also doable, if someone writes a "getty"
that uses the evdev interface for input (instead of tty's)
and the framebuffer interfaces for output (instead of tty's).

Looks  like much of the interest in ruby work disappeared as the evdev
option for X became widespread.  X is what most people use for desktops,
and that works well enough without ruby now.

"evdev" in the kernel already separates out independent keyboards.
Isolatedevice lets several xservers run indepenmdently.  There isn't
much missing, although there are minor troubles where starting one
xserver might mess up the video timing for another.  (Solution:
start xserver in an appropriate order, to be found by experimentation)
Another minor problem - it won't work with every combination of video cards,
only some.
Still - when it works you even get to run accelerated 3D on
the independent heads.  Nice for game parties.

I hope this helps.
