The reason he gave back when the discussion was first started (months ago)
was that klibc is designed to be directly linked into programs, and it was
felt that this would not be possible with the GPL. In fact klibc was
adopted instead of dietlibc speceificly BECOUSE of the license.
while you could add an additional clause to the GPL to allow it to be
linked into programs directly the I seriously doubt if the self appointed
'GPL police' would notice the issue and would expect that fears on the
subject would limit it's use.
