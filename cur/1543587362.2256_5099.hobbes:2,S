'Average' Linux machine is irrelevant. I still have a Sparc IPX
I occasionally use. I know people using still using 486's as they
can't afford anything better. Hell, even some of my P5 class machines
are starting to show their age, but they're still in daily use.
To say "Screw them, upgrade" is not an option IMO.

Well if you can make this run faster, this would kill my main
complaint with CML2.  I'll try out an updated version sometime.
