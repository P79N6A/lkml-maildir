On the other hand, I dont think you want major number releases of stable
kernels happening too quickly either.  For people who really care about
stability, moving from 2.2 to 2.4 is a big deal.  I dont think we really
want people to think that they need to do that kind of thing once a year
even if we could manage to get our development cycle shortened that much.
Thanks,
