I basically thought the same. In fact I do not understand why. Are there any parameters tunable to balance the whole picture a bit more towards the free pages?

I guess you mean the formerly patched debug-output, do you? I commented it out and saw a way better result than before. In fact I did not manage to break the NFS-copy at all, and although I managed to get the cpu load up to about 5 everything worked smoother. Only now and then were some moments where the display freezes "a bit", but mouse movement continues to work.
Anyway I am not sure, if it is intended that my browser gets swapped out only by copying files via NFS which are alltogether smaller than my physical 1 GB of RAM. I do think that there is still a little too much caching going on.

I am going to check that tomorrow. Downgrading is a bit tricky on this system.
Thanks Daniel, 
I'll be back
:-)
