Hi Ingo,
Yes, it will not have any effect but it enables additional code path 
leading to an
overhead in case of single-socket system. This overhead is only if
"sched_mc_power_savings = 1", however we are still leaving it to zero 
(default) and
preventing user space from turning it on by mistake.
Thanks,
