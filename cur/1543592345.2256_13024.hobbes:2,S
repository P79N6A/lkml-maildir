Hi, list
In ll_rw_block.c, before calling block device specific request function 
( i mean do_hd_request, do_ftl_request, ... ) the io_request_lock is 
locking, and all interrupts are disabling. I know, that request handler 
routine have to be atomic, but when we read data from a flash device ( 
for example ) we use a timeouts. Where do we have to enable timer 
interrupts, or should we disable all interrupts?
