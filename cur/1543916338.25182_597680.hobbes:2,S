Do you actually need a linked list of data?  This is similar to the
changes to bzImage to support booting bzImage a paravirt environment,
but I just proposed a pointer to a single info structure, along with a
field to identify the boot environment (ie, native/lguest/xen etc).  It
would be easy to extend this to handle EFI as just another boot
environment, and you could hang a list of structures off the pointer.
