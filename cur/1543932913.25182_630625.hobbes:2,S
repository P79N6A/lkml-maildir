Thanks for the detailed explanation.

Point well taken. Graphics devices understandably consume a lot of memory
space, and are likely to consume even more in the not-too-distant future.

No. My patch-set does not address this problem at all, but rather the
larger problem of having mmconfig-unfriendly devices on buses that are
out of reach of the unreachable_devices() routine and bitmap.
This problem is one I encountered during my testing and mentioned in
my preamble as not being fixable by my patch-set.
