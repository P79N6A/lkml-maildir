They are wrong about linux stifling innovation, there
is plenty of innovation in linux itself.
On the other hand:
''I can't imagine something that could be worse than this 
for the software business and the intellectual-property business.''
Sure.  Linux *is* bad for the IP business.  Open source outcompetes it!
I see no problem with that though.  And those who want to get
paid for computing work?  No problem.  There is always support.
