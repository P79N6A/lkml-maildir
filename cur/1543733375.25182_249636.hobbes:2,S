Sorry, but I think that's (Possibly?) a really really bad & misleading 
example... Apples & Apples vs Chocolate & Milkshakes... The dual screen 
problem with DRM & fb is two drivers accessing (Sometimes) the same 
hardware. The ext3 vs SCSI is a filesystem, that sits on-top of a disk 
device that may just be SCSI.. Or IDE..
The fs -> SCSI interface is a logical one.
Unless you can have fb sitting on top of DRM of course... (I discount 
DRM on-top of fb, because of the D == Direct... No other reason :)...
Does it make sens to have fb ontop of DRM at all? Anyone?

  Hamish.
