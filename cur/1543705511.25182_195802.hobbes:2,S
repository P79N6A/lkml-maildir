It'd be nice to come up with a way to avoid null funcs just for the
sake of satisfying function pointers, there's quite a few of them
around.

This sort of thing ought to be added to linux/compiler.h if it's not
there already.

Big-endian in this context means, of course, the order of the bits in
the byte rather than bytes in a word, and as this CRC polynomial was
chosen especially for its robustness on noise bursts in little-endian
transmission (aka standard serial and network *bit* transmission
ordering), I think we should intentionally omit BE support and make
note of it.

A lot of these BUG_ONs seem to be overkill. You're not going to get
here by someone accidentally misusing the interface. You can only get
here by some very willful abuse of the interface or by extremely
unlikely fandango on core, neither of which is worth trying to defend
against.
