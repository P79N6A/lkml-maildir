another nice feature would be the kernel ignoring the any "/n" in the 
command line. Currently if you accdentally pass the "/n" in the command 
line the most weird things happen.
for examle, type, following
mkelfImage /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.11-rc2-mm1 /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.11-rc2-mm1.elf \
--command-line="console=ttyS0,19200 root=/dev/nfs nfsroot=/ ip=any
init=/usr/src/cm/files/init.kexec.sh"
and watch kernel saying that it does not get any DHCP replies, while the 
real problem is that there's /n before init= line.
