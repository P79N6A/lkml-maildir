I'd actually like to see a 64-bit pid_t.  First of all, I've already once
being biten by a bug caused by a re-used PID resulting in the process
re-using getting killed.  Second never re-using PIDs will make get_pid()
trivial like
static inline pid_t get_pid(unsigned long flags)
{
	if (flags & CLONE_PID)
		return current->pid;
	return atomic_inc(last_pid);
}
Further optimizations are possible for certain special applications like
clusters.
(I think some of the realworld problems with different pid assignment
strategies have already been discussed on l-k before but I don't remember
the details anymore.)
