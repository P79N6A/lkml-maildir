I'm trying (just toying around really) to make two modules, one which uses
a function from another, and can't seem to manage to get the second one to
work.  The first (hello.o) declares a function hello_ps, and exports it
with "EXPORT_SYMBOL(hello_ps);".  The other (world.o) has 
extern void hello_ps(void);
int init_module(void) {
  hello_ps();
  return(0);
}
The problem being, if I load them, I get
zarniwoop:/devel/kernel# insmod hello.o
zarniwoop:/devel/kernel# insmod world.o
init_module: found dependency that is (no longer?) a module.
world.o: init_module: Invalid argument
zarniwoop:/devel/kernel#
nm seems to show them having the correct symbols exported and needed, and
after loading the first one, /proc/ksyms has hello_ps as expected -- what
am I doing wrong?
