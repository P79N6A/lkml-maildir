I think the two things which really prevented devfs from working were:
1. The namespace was too different from the original and required additional
configuration to maintain compatibility (devfsd and changes to core /etc
files.)
2. Devfs was not immediately picked up my the major distros, which meant that
any moderate end-user who wanted to use it would have to be careful when
setting it up or risk massive core breakage due to the changed device nodes
(initscripts failing and the like).
I used it for a very long time, personally; it was a good idea, and it had
potential. If the namespace that had been used was the same flat namespace as
the original /dev, it would have probably taken off. As it is, I think udev
is the new way of doing this (I haven't used it yet).
