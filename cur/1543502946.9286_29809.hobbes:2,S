I'm not sure if kill -9 <threaded process> is supposed to hit just one
(random) thread in the process, all of them, or just the initial thread, in
the POSIX semantics.  But assuming that the initial thread does get a
kill -9, yes, all the others are required to go away too.

You're right about stack management being done in user space, but this
forces the libc clone() stub to be coded in such a way that it can't be used
without CLONE_VM.  (Or you could write one that only works without it.  You
just can't have it both ways.)  This is because clone() with CLONE_VM
returns twice on the same stack, and will die horribly if allowed to do
anything at the C level afterward.  Like vfork, only worse.

I think if you do that then the zombie never gets reaped.
