It's the "complementary" that worries me. Once you have mcore, what
good are direct dumps to the network or the disk for ? With mcore,
the whole issue of accessing stable storage is eliminated.
I don't know if the approach of having multiple quasi-equivalent
means of storing a dump is something that Linus dislikes about
LKCD, but I think it might be worth exploring if LKCD's chance of
acceptance could be improved by focusing on a single but general
mechanism.
I think it would be a pity if we ended up not having crash dumps
in 2.6 only because they're over-featured ...
