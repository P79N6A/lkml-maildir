Arts uses whatever you have - i think ALSA is preferred.

Wait a minute!
Arts (I think JuK only tells Arts what to play) is a realtime task - if it 
does not meet its deadline you get drop outs. X is not a realtime task 
(unless you display video using it - is X even involved in video/3D?).
But you run X at a higher priority than Arts!? Don't you? You have told the
scheduler that X is more important than Arts - and you are surpriced that
you get dropouts?
Arts should really run as SCHED_FIFO or SCHED_RR but that opens another
can of worms - audio plugins can busy lock the computer... We need 
SCHED_SOFTRR now!
But you can try to prioritize arts higher than X (arts at -20, X at -15).
Or set suid root on artswrapper to get SCHED_FIFO, and then enable realtime 
scheduling in configuration.
