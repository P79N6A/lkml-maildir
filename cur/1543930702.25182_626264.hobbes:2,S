Unfortunately, I couldn't get the oops message. Because when this 
behavior happens, the machine hardly freezes and the SysRq combinations 
do not work. Also, I checked the logs (message,syslog,kern.log etc.) to 
see something suspicious. Unfortunately, there was none. Just one thing 
I noticed  when investigating on the logs: the kernel is doing its 
regular jobs. Like cron etc. So, the kernel is not really dieing. Next 
time, I will try to ssh to my machine to check what's going on, when 
this behavior occurred.
