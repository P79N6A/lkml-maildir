Actually, our current /dev/random implementation is secure even if  
the cryptographic algorithms can be broken under traditional  
circumstances.  Essentially /dev/random will refuse to output any  
more data well before enough could be revealed to predict the current  
pool state, such that it is fairly secure even in the event of total  
failure of the cryptographic primatives.

The way the /dev/random pool works is that writes are always  
guaranteed to add entropy to the pool (or at least never remove it),  
even if someone runs "dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/random".  The initial  
state for any given write is secure, and when hashing a random value  
for which a significant part of the state has not even been  
theoretically revealed with a known value, the result is still  
random.  Even beyond that, the random pool also hashes the current  
value of the cycle-counter or time of day into the pool with each  
call, adding a bit of extra entropy in any case.  The same hashing of  
the time of day also occurs on reads.

Well, actually the entropy pool is guaranteed not to lose entropy  
when it is stirred with data, but the whole point is to ensure that  
no userspace program *ever* has enough knowledge of the state of the  
pool to even begin a theoretical attack against past or future random  
values.  As a result it is perfectly OK for programs to dump whatever  
data they want into the random pool as extra security for _itself_,  
but the kernel does not trust it as extra security for itself.  Only  
root may inject guaranteed entropy and even then only using a  
specific ioctl, but any program may stir up the entropy pool however  
much it likes.

Exactly.

Precisely.  Personally I generate my random passwords using a little  
perl script reading from /dev/random (as opposed to /dev/urandom) but  
that's more due to personal paranoia than any practical reason.
When generating long-term cryptographic private keys, however, you  
*should* use /dev/random as it provides better guarantees about  
theoretical randomness security than does /dev/urandom.  Such  
guarantees are useful when the random data will be used as a  
fundamental cornerstone of data security for a server or network  
(think your root CA certificate or HTTPS certificate for your million- 
dollar-per-year web store).
