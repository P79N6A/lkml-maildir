:: Subject: [patch] ioapic-2.4.5-A1
:: 
:: 
:: 
:: the attached ioapic-2.4.5-A1 patch includes a number of 
:: important IO-APIC
:: related fixes (against 2.4.5-ac3):
:: 
::  - correctly handle bridged devices that are not listed in 
:: the mptable
::    directly. This fixes eg. dual-port eepro100 devices on 
:: Compaq boxes
::    with such PCI layout:
:: 
::     -+-[0d]---0b.0
::      +-[05]-+-02.0
::      |      \-0b.0
::      \-[00]-+-02.0
::             +-03.0-[01]--+-04.0    <=== eth0
::             |            \-05.0    <=== eth1
::             +-0b.0
::             +-0c.0
::             +-0d.0
::             +-0e.0
::             +-0f.0
::             +-14.0
::             +-14.1
::             +-19.0
::             +-1a.0
::             \-1b.0
:: 
::    without the patch the eepro100 devices get misdetected as 
:: XT-PIC IRQs
::    and their interrupts are stuck.
:: 
::  - the srcbus entry in the mptable does not have to be 
:: translated into
::    a PCI-bus value.
:: 
::  - add more APIC versions to the whitelist
:: 
::  - initialize mp_bus_id_to_pci_bus[] correctly, so that we can detect
::    nonlisted/bridged PCI busses more accurately.
:: 
:: the patch should only affect systems that were not working properly
:: before, but it might break broken-mptable systems - we'll see.
