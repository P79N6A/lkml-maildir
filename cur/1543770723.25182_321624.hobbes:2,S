Perhaps very slightly simpler. Let's keep in mind that we're
not talking about "hello, world" apps here though, so I don't
think such a general statement is of any use.

So does Windows NT to some. But let's stick to technical details.

Gee, I think you're treading very thin ground there. Basing your
argument on what possible companies or communities might possibly
support one of two unimplemented solutions.
What's more, there is no reason why a hard-RT guest kernel, or the
host nanokernel would be closed source.
