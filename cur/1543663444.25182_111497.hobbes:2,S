The POSIX clocks and timers support package on sourceforge has been 
updated.  It now _should_ work with all platforms.  I am sure you will 
tell me if it doesn't :)
This should make it easy to test new archs as they connect the POSIX 
clocks and timers system calls.
I have also included a new timer stress test from Randy Dunlap.
