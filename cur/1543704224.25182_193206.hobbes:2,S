Ohh, and _oooold_ bug fixed a long time ago in 2.4. There may actually
be another occurence of this one elsewhere iirc. I'll check that. Note
that this code is powermac specific anyway and that old radeonfb doesn't
work very well on a lot of powermacs, so it's not very urgent. The new
radeonfb which has that fixed for a long time will get in along with
the fbdev updates as soon as I'm finished cleaning them up.
