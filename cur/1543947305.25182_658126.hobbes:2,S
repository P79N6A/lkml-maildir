Something I've never understood, is why we would ever want to bother with *S4* at all?
I actually like hibernation (great for travelling), but I treat it as if
it were a complete power-off (S5?).  I pull batteries, unplug drives,
boot other operating systems, etc..
And when I put it all back together again with the Linux disk inserted,
I fully expect it to "resume" from the hibernation of 3 months ago.
And it does.
Why would I ever want anything less than a full poweroff for hibernation ????
Thanks.
