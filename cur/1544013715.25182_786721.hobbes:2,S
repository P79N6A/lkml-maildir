Good stuff!!!

When I download this, I see an 82.100963 immediately followed by an
167.894017, no 155.858923.  Do I have the right log?

Interesting.  The original function is 0xd1902ad0, passed to __call_rcu()
at 157.364214 -- would you be able to tell me what function that
corresponds to?  (Looks to me like a module, perhaps rcutorture?)
Whatever function it is, the rcu_head definitely got corrupted some
time during the 8 milliseconds or so that the callback was waiting for
a grace period.  However, it did just fine being invoked several times
beforehand -- this is a very popular RCU callback function, it appears.
My guess is that the ensuing CPU 0 stall messages are due to CPU 0
having a heart attack trying to execute at address 0.
Are you swapping over NFS, or is the netpoll_send_udp() just garbage on
the stack?

Hmmm...  The main recent change to kernel/rcutorture.c is the addition
of a reboot notifier, so that rcutorture can shut itself down gracefully
should the system go down while rcutorture is still running.  This panic
occurs in rcu_torture_stutter(), which is shown below:
	static int
	rcu_torture_stutter(void *arg)
	{
		VERBOSE_PRINTK_STRING("rcu_torture_stutter task started");
		do {
			schedule_timeout_interruptible(stutter * HZ);
			stutter_pause_test = 1;
			if (!kthread_should_stop() && !fullstop)
				schedule_timeout_interruptible(stutter * HZ);
			stutter_pause_test = 0;
		} while (!kthread_should_stop() && !fullstop);
		VERBOSE_PRINTK_STRING("rcu_torture_stutter task stopping");
		return 0;
	}
I don't see any reason why this function would transfer control to
location 0x60, though I do see a bug in the new shutdown code.  I
don't expect this to make any difference, but a patch is included
nevertheless.

Hmmm...  Offset 0x60 seems to be a common thread.  This lets
rcu_torture_ops off the hook, since it isn't that large.
Anyway, could you give the attached patch a go, even though I cannot see
how it would help?  ;-)
Do you get the same error running Classic RCU?
							Thanx, Paul
> Greetings, Eric
Fix an rcutorture bug that prevents the shutdown notifier from ever
actually having any effect, due to the fact that kthreads ignore all
signals.
