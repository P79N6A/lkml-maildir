That depends a good deal on how you define "real". :-)

Yes.  Moreover, we can do something like that without a userspace
tunable, if we check for the free swap before we try to shrink memory.
This would take some time to implement, though, and I'd rather
like to do the userland interface first.
The tunable may be useful to people who'd like to achieve the
maximum efficiency of suspend/resume and it would be a nice
feature to have, I think, but let's say we'll try to implement it
in the future, if still needed/wanted.
Greetings,
Rafael
