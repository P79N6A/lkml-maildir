220-This is a Linux PC (Dell PE-2650, 2 CPUs P4/2800, 12 GB RAM)
220-running SuSE-Linux-8.2 with SuSE kernel 2.4.20-64GB-SMP.
There is no reason to upgrade the hardware - if it works, hey good then.
And I am pretty sure that a few 2 GB sticks are cheaper than a big 
opteron (if you only go by that). It sure is now - and probably even 
back then.
