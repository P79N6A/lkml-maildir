Hello,
I have a Tyan S1854 Trinity 400 mb machine with a
PCI rtl8139 card connected to my local net and a
ISA 3c509 card connected to my dsl link.  Masquerade
is set up.
I seem to get pretty good performance from 
internet->masq box and from masq box->internal
lan, but when a internal box tries to get to the
net through the masquerade, connection seem to time
out.  I'll get a pretty good initial burst, then
connections stall.
I'm using test13-pre4.  I saw some iptables stuff on
the list a week or so ago, was this fixed in pre4 or
is this my problem?
I can provide any information needed.
