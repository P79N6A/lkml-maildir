Yes, I stopped short of that argument only because capabilities fall
into a bit more of a gray zone than other modules.  But I do prefer
leaving it in the module.

On Linux they are.  On IRIX they aren't.  This is part of the issue as I
see it.

Actually the only glaring difference (aside from the uid/suid and non-root
execs nonroot-yet-diff-id-setuid-app issue I mentioned earlier) is in
something like "=ep cap_setpcap-ep cap_ipc_lock+i" IIRC.
I have the feeling we both are after the same thing, which is introducing
the ability to keep some caps through exec and still being able to sleep
at night w/ confidence that there isn't some subtle new hole lurking.
This is why I aimed to change as little code as possible.

Hehe, arm wrestling could be entertaining ;-)  I'm in favor of the most
conservative change, which I feel is in my patch.  But I'm game to
continue to pick on each.
