I do use this to forward port 21 from the firewall to the ftp server.
[BTW does it suffice to use ip_masq_portfw and ipchains REDIRECT option to
call a transparent proxy or do I have to rewrite URLs for web access?]

I do have ipmasqadm but I never used ip_masq_mfw. Isn't this used to forward
packages if they are marked by ipchains?
I doubt this will help a lot since upon receiving "PASV" the server responds
with his IP number and a port number where it expects the client to connect.
With this IP number being an internal number the client cannot do this.
