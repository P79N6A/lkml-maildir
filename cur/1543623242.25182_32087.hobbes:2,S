Andrea, don't forget that the "old" NUMAs will soon be the "new" NUMAs
again.  The internal bus and clock speeds are still quite likely to
increase faster than the speeds of most interconnects.  And even quite
a few "big SMP" machines today are really somewhat NUMA-like with a
2 to 1 - remote to local memory latency (e.g. the Corollary interconnect
used on a lot of >4-way IA32 boxes is not as fast as the two local
busses).
So, desiging for the "new" NUMAs is fine if your code goes into
production this year.  But if it is going into production in two to
three years, you might want to be thinking about some greater memory
latency ratios for the upcoming hardware configurations...
