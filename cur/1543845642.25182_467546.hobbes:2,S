Interesting.  I'll try to give it a careful review in the next couple
of days.
I've added Jay Lan <jlan@sgi.com> to the cc list.  I encourage you to
include him on your cc list in the future - thanks.  He has expertise
in some of SGI's earlier container-like efforts.

thanks ;
Question (perhaps already answered in your code - I haven't looked
yet): can loadable kernel modules register containers?  I'd like to
see at least GPL modules be able to register containers, but I
appreciate that this could be a controversial issue.  Technically, I am
guessing that some EXPORT_GPL_SYMPOL declarations on the necessary
container registration routines would provide GPL modules with this
capability.
Guess I should read the code ...
