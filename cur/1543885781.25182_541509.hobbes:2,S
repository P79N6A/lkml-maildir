i hadn't actually considered *that* possibility, but the idea is sort
of what i had in mind -- a clear, top-level setting that, in one swell
foop, will change what's available throughout the tree.  i think
that's the most intuitively clear way to do it.

p.s.  mostly, i just don't think labelling that selection with the
word "EMBEDDED" makes a lot of sense.  who's to say that any given
feature should be de-selectable only on an embedded system?
