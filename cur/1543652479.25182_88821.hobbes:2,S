From "man execve":
       E2BIG  The argument list is too big.
From "man sysconf":
       _SC_ARG_MAX
              The  maximum  length of the arguments to the exec()
              family of functions;  the  corresponding  macro  is
              ARG_MAX.
On my RedHat 8.0 box:
       $ getconf ARG_MAX
       131072
It is definately a kernel limitation, although as other people have
pointed out, there are common userspace solutions to the problem.
