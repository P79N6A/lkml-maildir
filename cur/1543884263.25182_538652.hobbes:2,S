Hi Jeff, it seems that lkml has contacted both of my email accounts and
cripped them.
I can no longer recieve email from lkml on this account.
I can neither recieve or send email to lkml from my other account.
They have also just deleted the 4 emails I sent to lkml from the page
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/4/30/
This included one to you.
In case you didn't get it,... here it is again.
-----------
I used GRUB and the kernel and initrd from a separate partition to boot
a Reiser4 installation.
