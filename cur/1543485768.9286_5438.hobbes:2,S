Well, this works so on either NFS and local-disk and RAM-disk. (Perhaps
I should try more FS).
As I know NFS doesn't walk through the Filesystemstructure (in this case
ufs) in any way. It has a seperate entry-point to get the vnodes.
And IMO this is not a Filesystem-feature but a rmdir()-feature in SUNOS
5.5.1 (see truss rmdir ../x or something like this). And as I know the
rmdir()-function has nothing to do with the underlying filesystem (I may
be wrong nevertheless).
Bye Martin
