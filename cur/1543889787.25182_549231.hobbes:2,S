I had read that as well.  It seems this the API for the cancel is 
restricted such that you cannot call it if there is nothing to cancel.
This means the netpoll code is incorrect and the simple fix is 
attached.  With the change the netpoll_cleanup works correctly in 2.6.21.

Do not call cancel_rearming_delayed_work() if there is no
pending work.
