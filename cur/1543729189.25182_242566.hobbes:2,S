Hi, Matt,
I believe that we should export the netpoll_set_trap routine as GPL only,
since vendors could conceivably use it to by-pass the networking stack
completely.  Jeff, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think this is what you
intended when you commented on it many months ago (sorry, can't find the
thread).
