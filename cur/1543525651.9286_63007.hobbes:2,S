And because you didn´t encounter instability it does not exist?
I have three systems here (Dual P54C-200, 128 MB RAM DPT-3334UW,
AHA-2940UW, AHA-2940 and 3c905TX) which froze with every kernel
between 2.2.5 and 2.2.13 within hours. No OOPS, no nothing. Just
dead.  And since i didn´t like to check that 150GB Hardware-RAID5
every boot, i went back to 2.0.36 UP and enjoyed a rock solid system.
(Just compiling 2.2.x as UP was not enough...)
Now finally 2.2.14 appears to be stable on this hardware: one system
is up for over four days now... As soon as the uptime of this system
reaches 30 days i will consider switching the system with the RAID
over to 2.2.14...
Yours,
