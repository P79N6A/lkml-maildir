Maybe. At least the first thing I would like is for the pci64 patch to
be merged in 2.4. That should be very doable without risking breakage.
When that is done it's easier to see what the block-highmem patch does.
And I believe that we _can_ merge it in 2.4 without a 2.5 trial, it's
really not that intrusive.
