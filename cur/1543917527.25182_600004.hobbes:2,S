Ok, I found a palliative.
Now I'm working with "mem=6770M" option, that gives me 6072MB RAM (of
6144 total).
Interesting, that if you choose too much, like "mem=6800M", system
behaviour is exactly the same as without any options.
Can it be that kernel incorrectly sets amount of memory to use so such
a situation occurs?
