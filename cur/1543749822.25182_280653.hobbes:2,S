I changed your code with the following:
@@ -25,11 +25,15 @@
     if (child_pid) {
         /* parent */
         int status = 0, timeout = 1;
+       struct sigaction sa;
+       sa.sa_handler = sig_handler;
+       sa.sa_flags = SA_NOMASK;
         do {
             printf("Parent: setting an alarm for %d seconds\n", timeout);
-            signal(SIGALRM, sig_handler);
+           sigaction(SIGALRM, &sa,NULL);
+//            signal(SIGALRM, sig_handler);
             alarm(timeout);
             printf("Parent: waiting for a child %d\n", child_pid);
And got the following result:
$ ./alarmit
Child:  sleeping for 6 seconds
Parent: setting an alarm for 1 seconds
Parent: waiting for a child 25926

I guess it's a feature, and the default signal function must have
SA_RESTART set.

Use sigaction instead of signal.
