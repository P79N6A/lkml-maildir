Hi Torsten,
I maintain the driver and am interested in figuring out what this
problem is.  Can you please tell me what the device major/minor are
on /dev/tpm.  Any output produced by the driver in /var/log/messages.
Also the output of /sbin/lspci.  Also I am assuming you are using the
version in the default 2.6.12-rc5.  There are many changes are in the -
mm2 patch so I will pull down the default tree and make sure the version
there is working.
Thanks,
Kylie
