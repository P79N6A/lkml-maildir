Not sure what a recursive exception is. You mean the interrupt?
It looks ...very... ug^w^wcomplicated.

That doesn't make sense. softirqs get processed after interrupts,
not on return to user space. So the nested interrupt should handle
its own softirqs because the softirq counters are already decreased.

It's still not clear to me why you can't do cli ; check again ; iret-equivalent
to handle this.

Doesn't seem to be different to me than a normal interrupt anywhere
else. If you're worried about overflow use interrupt stacks.
