It tries to unify both and make usage consistent over the allocator 
functions in slab.c. kzalloc essentially vanishes.

Yes the inline function doubles the code generated for obj_checkout 
because it occurs in __cache_alloc and __cache_alloc_node. 
__cache_alloc is also an inline and is expanded three times.
Removing the inline from __cache_alloc could reduced code size.
