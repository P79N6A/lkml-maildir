Subject: ov511 compilation failure 2.5.18 - struct urb has no next

Since 2.5.18 I'm getting compilation errors in ov511.c.
ov511.c: In function `ov51x_init_isoc':
ov511.c:3978: structure has no member named `next'
ov511.c:3980: structure has no member named `next'
Struct member 'next' has been removed from struct urb.
Can I simply remove these lines that setup this 'ring'?
