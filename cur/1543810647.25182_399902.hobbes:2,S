Ted,
	Do you mean that you are using a distro (eg, RHEL4 or something)
with a mainline kernel?  We've seen something similar, and what we've
determined is happening is that insmod is returning before the module is
done initializing.  It's not that mptscsi fails to detect the disks.
Rather, it's still in the detection process when the boot process tries
to mount /.  So there's no / yet, and the thing hangs.  In the case we
see, it's some interaction between the RHEL4/SLES9 version of
module-init-tools and the latest version of the kernel.  Our first
attempt at fixing it was to change the linuxrc to sleep between each
insmod.  This works, but only if the modules load and initialize
themsleves fast enough.  Get a FC card in there, and it just doesn't
work.  So we've taken to compiling the modules in-kernel.
Joel
