Hi!
I found it works if I disable "save/restore of hw state".
I still need to restart driver of my psaux mouse.

PS: BTW you should talk to acpi maintainers: acpi requires _os_ to do
this kind of stuff.
PPS: You should warn about logging filesystems. Using swsusp on
reiserfs could lead to pretty bad things: mounting of reiserfs (even
readonly!) means log is replayed, which means writes to
filesystem. That could lead to pretty bad corruption.
