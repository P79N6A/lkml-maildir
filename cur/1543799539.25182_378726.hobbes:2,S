No it does not.
Ingo's work has shown us two things:
a) semaphores use more kernel text than they should and
b) semaphores are less efficient than they could be.
Fine.  Let's update the semaphore implementation to fix those things. 
Nobody has addressed this code in several years.  If we conclusively cannot
fix these things then that's the time to start looking at implementing new
locking mechanisms.

We'd only need such constructs if we were trying to add all the mutex
runtime debugging features to semaphores.  I don't think that's likely to
be very useful so fine, let's not do that.

Linus would not be averse to a patch which optimises semaphores.

This where I have a bad feeling that I'm missing some vital clue.
An efficient semaphore implementation will wake a single process per up(). 
Just like mutexes.  So why should mutexes have any performance advantage?
