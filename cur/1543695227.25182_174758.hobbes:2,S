Agreed, somewhat. The problem IMHO is that, even for caps like 
CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH, no existing code expects this behavior.  (Windows 
example again: users with SeBackupPrivilege have a _very_ hard time 
using it since few programs actually know what to do with it.)  If I'm a 
user with CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH, I don't want to have to rewrite all of 
fileutils just to use that privilege.  Users can still have this 
behavior, though, under my proposed evolution rules:
pE' = pP' & (pE|fP)
Pretend that 'cap' is a bash builtin that did the obvious thing:
~backupuser/.bashrc: cap all disable
~backupuser/bin/privrun: cap all enable; exec $*
Now that user can't accidentally use CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH, but s/he could 
do 'privrun ls', for example, if necessary.  (I'm ignoring funny issues 
with cd here.)  All of this is without the fE mask and without modifying 
or breaking existing user tools.
If you can think of a use for fE, let me know :)
