Ehmmm 3 letters: Yep
Ofcourse I did.... it did work for 2.2.10 and earlier, something in 
2.2.10+ simply has changed or I did something otherwise wrong which
broke... ?
It compiles 100% correctly, it doesn't link though on insmod....
(Works now... as I've include the memset routine i the same .c file...)
Check the diff here: 
http://unfix.org/projects/changer/
 page for the last
diff...
Any other suggestions are welcome :)
Greets,
 Jeroen
