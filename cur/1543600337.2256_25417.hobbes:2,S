Hello All,
   I was wondering; I can't trace a cloned child using ptrace
call (and strace program) I found a couple of mails regarding the
same problem within the mail archive, but I couldn't find any
solution for it. Am I doing something wrong, or there really
isn't a solution yet? (I'm using v2.4.9)
Regards,
Taylan
