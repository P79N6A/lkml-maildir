Very interesting...  This whole time I thought that your testing was 
using a VSB stream.
So, you're only talking about problems with analog NTSC?
It seems that I might be having a similar (but NOT the same) problem 
with my FusionHDTV3 Gold-T, but it has nothing to do with the kernel 
version.  Let me remind you that this card uses Thomson DDT 7611, and 
your card uses Thomson DDT 7610.  It simply doesnt work anymore, 
regardless of whether I am in Linux or Windows, no matter which kernel 
version.  Only digital ATSC (using QAM256) is working for me.
I will have to test NTSC using my FusionHDTV5 Gold, installed in my 
other box.  It doesnt have 2.6.15 installed right now.  I will wait for 
2.6.15-rc3 to propogate to the kernel.org mirrors before I install it, 
so this may take some time.  The other card, however, has a TUA6034 
tuner, inside an LG TDVS-H062F ... not the same tuner as you this time, 
but still a cx88 board.
Anyway, after 2.6.15-rc3 propogates and I get it installed, I'll let you 
know how my testing goes.  Would you do the same?
Cheers,
Mike
