Few questions:
- Can you send dmesg output?
- Are you using the ahci driver with the Intel SATA controller? There have
been some bugfixes in ahci during v2.4.31, although they dont look suspect.
Is there load on the interface?
- Is the USB UHCI controller being used? There are known SMP problems 
in the usb-uhci driver recently fixed (problem introduced in v2.4.28 though).
- What is the workload on these machines?
- Have you tried v2.4.31-pre1, -pre2, and so on to isolate the possibly problematic
change?
