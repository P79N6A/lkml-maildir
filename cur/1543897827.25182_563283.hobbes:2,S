That's exactly my point. The meaning of of_platform_bus_probe() is 'add all
direct children of these nodes', not 'add these nodes', although it
happens to do that in the process.
Of course, looking at the device tree, rapidio is a device, not a bus,
because it does not have a device_type and it does not have any children
of its own.
