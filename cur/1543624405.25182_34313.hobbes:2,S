Yes, yes - 
http://people.redhat.com/arjanv/pdcraid/ataraidhowto.html
From the page - "Currently, only RAID level 0 (striping) is supported, for
the Promise Fasttrak(tm) and Highpoint HPT370 series of IDE RAID
controllers." - everything else is well explained.
You may also use the closed source linux drivers from
www.highpoint-tech.com, if you need full support.
Bye
