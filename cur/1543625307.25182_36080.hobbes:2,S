'c' is a piece of cake. People wrote tools using directory notifiers that
do nothing but try and subvert every /tmp/ file as it appears. Neat and
novel [ab]use of it. 
This is however a kernel list. Security notifications ought to go to the
vendor and if they dont respond after a while to bugtraq where it would
be on topic and score you leetness bonuses
