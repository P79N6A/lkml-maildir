It's the problem Cornelia reported in the thread the patch was posted.
Okay, somehow it's missing lkml on cc list.  I included everybody
related but missed lkml.  A lot of screw ups lately.  My apologies.
Currently, known problems are...
1. new sysfs_drop_dentry() not allowing drop of parent when it's not
empty.  Reported by Cornelia and this thread reports the same problem.
I'm working on it now.
2. using sysfs_dirent pointer as sysfs inode number doesn't work because
ino_t is smaller than ulong on some archs.  It's also broken for 32bit
apps on 64bit archs.  Updated patch just submitted for review.
3. Sysfs rename doesn't work.  I broke it during the first series of
sysfs updates.  Will fix in a few days.
Again, sorry for all the troubles.  I'll be more careful.
