Reading "Linux Core Kernel Commentary" at bedtime,
I noticed what looks like a wraparound bug in 
do_timer_interrupt() that could cause set_rtc_mmss
to get called once per second (instead of once
every 11 minutes) for an 11 minute interval near
the wraparound of xtime.tv_sec in the year 2038.
Uh, ok, so that's not the most urgent bug to fix :-)
but could somebody check my logic?  Here would be
the patch (using my favorite idiom for checking
timers without getting caught by wraparound:
turning the unsigned comparison into a signed comparison
with zero):
