Please count the removal of the *very* sparse read_ahead array as
well (patch went to this list a long time ago) in.
It doesn't cost anything and saves some few pages depending on the
number of drivers you have loaded... (Well in comparision to the above
that's nit picking, but...) 
And then there is the overloaded struct inde. It would be worth
quite a bit of memmory to not overlay the private,filesystem 
specific parts but to attach them by a pointer instead, in esp.
if you make this in a way where the private part would be used 
without the public interface in drivers. Currently the most rudiculous
inode layout is deterministic for the overall size in the compiled
kernel.
