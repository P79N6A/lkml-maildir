Hi,
 I am trying to deploy IP Forwarding on an embedded system running on Linux
[ Kernel > 2.4 ] with mips target.
 I do a "echo "1" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward" to enable and "echo "0" >
/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward" to disable the IP Forwarding feature.
 The hardware setup i have is as below
1. Linux PC [ Ref PC A ] with eth0 IP Address say 192.168.100.5
2. Linux PC [ Ref PC B ] with eth0 IP Address say 192.168.101.5
3. The embedded target has 2 NIC's. eth0 IP Address is 192.168.100.6 and
eth1 IP Address is 192.168.101.6.
4. A hub connecting subnet 100 machines
5. A hub connecting subnet 101 machines
 I setup the default gateways on both the Reference PC's to reflect their
own IP Address. Each of the Ref PC's can ping to the machines on their
subnet.
 But when i ping Ref PC A to Ref PC B; the give the error "Destination host
is unreachable".
 I tried to resolve the problem and found a few info on the net. Based on
that i found that
1. there was no /etc/sysconfig directory on the target embedded system 
2. there was no /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts directory
3. no /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0, eth1, eth0:1 and eth1:0
files 
4. there was no /etc/sysconfig/network file
 I created all of the above [ i have pasted the contents of each file below
]. Yet i get the same error. Can somebody tell what am i not doing or what
am i doing wrong?
Thanks and Regards,
Abdij
