	AFAIK, the driver from www.realtek.com.tw *is* 8139too.

	Yep, it doesn't seem to be a driver problem, but forcing a buggy 
configuration to the driver.
	What probably happened is that when you downloaded the driver from 
the Realtek website, the modules.conf part of this "new" driver (or 
some other script you might be using to load it) isn't forcing any 
options and letting the driver figure out the best configuration.
	Kind Regards,
Felipe
