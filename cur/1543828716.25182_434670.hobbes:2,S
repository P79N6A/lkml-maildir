And if we'll write after that to 0th page,
data with size <=page size, we can get garbage(not zeroes) 
on the rest of page.
Definitely, after block allocation, 
we should touch pages from inode cache,
which belongs to block except current page.

May be there is some incomprehension here,
this series and all other my patches in -mm related to UFS
is not introduced write support for UFS, they fixes
bugs similar to which you point out in black corners 
of the existing implementation.
Note: almost all such bugs related to 
touch blockdev's cache instead of inode's cache, and working
with blockdev's buffer cache without take into consideration
that it's also page cache).
