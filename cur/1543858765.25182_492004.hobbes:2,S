Like so?  I manually edited the patch and weakened a few of the space
rules, basically the ones in dispute in this thread.
From: Randy Dunlap <randy.dunlap@oracle.com>
Add some kernel coding style comments, mostly pulled from emails
by Andrew Morton, Jesper Juhl, and Randy Dunlap.
- add paragraph on switch/case indentation (with fixes)
- add paragraph on multiple-assignments
- add more on Braces
- add section on Spaces; add typeof, alignof, & __attribute__ with sizeof;
  add more on postfix/prefix increment/decrement operators
- add paragraph on function breaks in source files; add info on
  function prototype parameter names
- add paragraph on EXPORT_SYMBOL placement
- add section on /*-comment style, long-comment style, and data
  declarations and comments
- correct some chapter number references that were missed when
  chapters were renumbered

+		3.1:  Spaces
+
+Linux kernel style for use of spaces depends (mostly) on
+function-versus-keyword usage.  Use a space after (most) keywords.  The
+notable exceptions are sizeof, typeof, alignof, and __attribute__, which
+look somewhat like functions (and are usually used with parentheses in
+Linux, although they are not required in the language, as in: "sizeof info"
+after "struct fileinfo info;" is declared).
+
+So use a space after these keywords:
+	if, switch, case, for, do, while
+but not with sizeof, typeof, alignof, or __attribute__.  E.g.,
+	s = sizeof(struct file);
+
+Do not add spaces around (inside) parenthesized expressions.
+This example is *bad*:
+
+	s = sizeof( struct file );
+
+When declaring pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type,
+the preferred use of '*' is adjacent to the data name or function name
+and not adjacent to the type name.  Examples:
+
+	char *linux_banner;
+	unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
+	char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
+
+When placing spaces around operators, try to make the code as readable
+as possible.  While readability is a highly personal matter, the
+following rules are a good starting point (and _not_ the ultimate
+wisdom in all cases, mind you ;):
+Tend to use one space around (on each side of) most binary and ternary
+operators, such as any of these:
+	=  +  -  <  >  *  /  %  |  &  ^  <=  >=  ==  !=  ?  :
+
+avoid spaces after unary operators:
+	&  *  +  -  ~  !  sizeof  typeof  alignof  __attribute__  defined
+
+no spaces before the postfix increment & decrement unary operators:
+	++  --
+
+avoid spaces after the prefix increment & decrement unary operators:
+	++  --
+
+and no space around the '.' and "->" structure member operators.
