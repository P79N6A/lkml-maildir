If the checksum field is the only one thats incorrect or messed
up, then disabling the checksum will suffice.  But if any other part
of the packet is also corrupted or altered in some way, it
might fail the many other checks both IP and TCP perform.
(Sorry, I know thats fairly obvious, but its easy to miss a check
or two. :) )
