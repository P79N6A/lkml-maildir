Hi!
  I tested  the prex  [ x=1..8 ]  kernels in  the last 2  or 3  weeks. I
found that the most instable version is the pre8!
  I got  a lot of  segfaults from my netscape,  top often foget  to show
the process table, and cdparanoia slowed down!
  vfat.o is broken  (there are one undefined  symbol (maybe d_initialize
or something like that)).
