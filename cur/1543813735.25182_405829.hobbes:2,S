I belive the modes should say DMA100 because UDMA133 would be mode ATA-7
and DMA100 ATA-6 mode. This is the info i get from hdparm -I on the ata3
drive: DMA: mdma0 mdma1 mdma2 udma0 udma1 udma2 udma3 udma4 *udma5
while on the ata4 one:  DMA: mdma0 mdma1 mdma2 udma0 udma1 udma2 udma3
udma4 udma5 *udma6
The thing is that the older drive is the one with the mode being set at
133 while the newer with mode 100. I belive they come from the same
factory but do carry different firmware revisons.
I also tried the drives on sata_sil (sil3114) controller and they show
the same modes being detected:

I also see a difference with the transfer rates from hdparm -Tt:
ata3 drive (mode UDMA100) shows:
Timing buffered disk reads:  172 MB in  3.00 seconds =  57.30 MB/sec
while ata4 drive (mode UDMA133) shows:
Timing buffered disk reads:  118 MB in  3.03 seconds =  38.96 MB/sec
At this point is this due to drive capabilites in regards to modes
supported, broken drive? or libata code bug? I am trying to be as clear
as possible, anything else i should provide?
Thanks,
Paul B.
