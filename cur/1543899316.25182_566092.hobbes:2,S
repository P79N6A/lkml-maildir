That means nothing was mounted there ...

... but still umount succeeded? Didn't it complain about nothing
being mounted there in the first place? Surprising that it actually
resolved the problem ...

Yes, that could be the case. Could you please:
1. Tell us which kernel version was it? .config?
2. Was there some dmesg output from the failed mount(2) attempt?
3. What was the mount command line / options?
Then:
1. Rebuild kernel with CIFS_DEBUG2.
2. Revert back (on the XP share export side) to the buggy / incorrect
settings -- so that you can try and reproduce the problem.
3. Let us know if you could reproduce, if so, any debug ouput / etc?
Thanks,
Satyam
