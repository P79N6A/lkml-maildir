major? the MMConfig support is minimal as I can see?

Is this code necessary for PCI-Express devices/busses to work properly?

I've humbly asked Len to stop doing big updates whenever possible on the 
v2.4 ACPI code, and do bugfixes only instead. Is that a pain in the ass for you, Len?    
I asked that because it is common to see new bugs introduced by an ACPI update, 
and you know that more than I do.
Thanks!
PS: Greg, about the PCI-Express hotplug drivers, I assume they are independant 
on any of this?
