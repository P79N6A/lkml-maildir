There were numerous bugs in the SCHED_ISO design prior to now, so it 
really was not performing as expected. What is most interesting is that 
the DSP load goes to much higher levels now if xruns are avoided and 
stay at those high levels. If I push the cpu load too much so that they 
get transiently throttled from SCHED_ISO, after the Xrun the dsp load 
drops to half. Is this expected behaviour?
Anyway the next patch works well in my environment. Jack, while I 
realise you're getting the results you want from Ingo's dropped 
privilege, dropped cpu limit patch I would appreciate you testing this 
patch. It is not clear yet what direction we will take, but even if we 
dont do this, it would be nice just because of the effort on my part.
This version of the patch has full priority support and both ISO_RR and 
ISO_FIFO.
This is the patch to apply to 2.6.11-rc2-mm1:
