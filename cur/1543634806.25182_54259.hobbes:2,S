Any code that exports symbols must be compiled with -DEXPORT_SYMTAB.
That flag is used in module symbol version processing to generate the
versioned symbols.
It used to be that omitting -DEXPORT_SYMTAB would only cause an error
when CONFIG_MODVERSIONS=y.  Since most developers did not use
modversions, entries were being added to the kernel tree without
correct makefile definitions.  To ensure correct definitions in the
makefile for all circumstances, the code was changed to always require
-DEXPORT_SYMTAB for exporting objects, with or without
CONFIG_MODVERSIONS.
Bottom line: if you export symbols you must always define -DEXPORT_SYMTAB.
