There's a lot of good value in having all those details, as it helps people
standardize on more common practices, including details.  I think removing
all those details may only increase the amount-of less-accepted code to be
posted, resulting in more lkml people having to repeat themselves on what
not to do.  Only now, they won't be able to point people to the CodingStyle
file for what they should do right.
Would you prefer if CodingStyle was reorganized or even split into (1)
general principles and (2) details?  Perhaps we need a CodingStylePrinciples
and a CodingStyleDetails?
IOW, where should that very useful info live?
Erez.
