what exactly do you mean here? To set up LINT0 as ExtINT and to unmask
IRQ0 in the 8259A, and to mask the IOAPIC pin? Or to set up the according
IOAPIC routing entry as ExtINT? The later one is completely pointless - if
there is an IOAPIC pin for IRQ0 then we want that to be a LowPrio IRQ. If
we set it up through the local APIC's LINT0 pin, then we lose the ability
to route to multiple CPUs. (it makes no difference that the 8259A's INTR
output signal is driven to all CPUs, there is no mechanizm to distribute
this between CPUs, we'd get an interrupt on all CPUs at once, and had to
do some sort of software-selection - clearly complex and suboptimal.)

and? The NMI oopser doesnt work on UP boxes either.
