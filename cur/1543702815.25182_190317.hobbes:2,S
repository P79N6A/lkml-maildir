Hmmm. Did you get the original warning that we were talking about, 
before any changes were made? It still gives *me* the warnings, 
regardless of how it's written. What arch/compiler are you on? If you're 
on an arch/compiler that makes gas do 32-bit arithmetic, you're not 
going to get any warning -- it's going to be fine, because of gas's 
warning logic. I use an i386/gcc 3.3 system (debian unstable). Do you 
get no warnings as well on that configuration?
