I ignore stupid comments, yours falls into that category.  I have good
reason for asking for Linus's OPINION before sending the patch.  Note I
am not asking Linus to take the patch right now, I am asking for some
guidance.  Unless you have something useful to contribute, I will
continue to ignore you.
