In the meantime, you may just queue the thing to memory (as the allocated
memory chunk is likely to be larger than a pointer given alignment) and
use some helper thread that dequeue things to free and does the actual
free in 'non-interrupt' context (only on ports that are unable to free
under interrupt context, obviously).
