Ok, here it comes again,
I don't like the idea of having a web server in the kernel, I don't think it
belongs there.
Yes I'm pretty familiar with TUX, I believe that it is a foundamental piece of
achievement in web server performance study. Neverthanless I think that it is
sitting on the wrong spot.
I'm building an alternative web server that is entirely in _user space_ and
that achieves the same level of performance as TUX. Presently I can match TUX
performance within 10-20%, and I still have quite a few improvements in my
pocket.
Nevertheless I need some minimal help from the kernel, like a FAST (and
secure?) mechanism for socket forwarding and a better (non-blocking on
files) sendfile interface.
For the time being I'm using a socket delivery mechanism similar to that of
TUX and khttpd, as I stated at the beginning of this thread. I don't like the
idea of patching the kernel, I don't believe that it is a viable distribution
mechanism and I'm trying to find a better way of adding the functionality that
I require as a kernel module.
Currently the "right" kernel network interfaces are exposed to the modules only
if khttpd or ipv6 are compiled as modules. Can we change this such that a
standard binary kernel (say, the one coming with a vanilla RedHat distrubution
or similar) would expose the right stuff?
Would it make any sense to have a real system call doing this kind of stuff?
HELP! :)
TIA, ciao,
 - Fabio
