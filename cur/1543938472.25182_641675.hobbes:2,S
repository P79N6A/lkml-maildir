Definitely, if we change the code further without doing anything to
consolidate it in the first place. 
Have you even cared to look, why PAT is so ugly and fragile ? Simply
because it interferes/interacts with CPA and the page table code. So
adding further stuff to that area without considering the requirements
of PAT will make it worse.

It's not a question of complicated or not. Fact is, that PAT is
interfering with all this and any new feature will make it harder to
stabilize.

Not at all. If the simple stuff makes it harder to do something else,
then it is not longer simple. Then it is simply in the way. 
If your patches are so simple, then they can be done on top of a
consolidated CPA/PAT easily.

I can understand that, because it is in the way of your particular
interests, but we have to look at the global picture and not at the
personal preferences of you or anyone else.
