According to an article here:
http://slashdot.org/articles/03/05/01/2332226.shtml?tid=167&tid=99
SCO-Caldera Senior Vice President Chris Sontag explicitly says that the 
kernel.org kernel is *not* tainted, but that that other stuff that Red Hat and 
SuSE are including *is*.
Quote from the interview:
"Chris Sontag: We're not talking about the Linux kernel that Linus and others 
have helped develop. We're talking about what's on the periphery of the Linux 
kernel."
He doesn't specify exactly what he's talking about, but he makes an interesting 
claim:
"Chris Sontag: We are using objective third parties to do comparisons of our 
UNIX System V [SCO-owned Unix] source code and Red Hat as an example. We are 
coming across many instances where our proprietary software has simply been 
copied and pasted or changed in order to hide the origin of our System V code in 
Red Hat. This is the kind of thing that we will need to address with many Linux 
distribution companies at some point."
