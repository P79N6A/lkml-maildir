   That means sendmsg() changes the page tables?
Not in the zerocopy patch I am proposing and asking people to test.  I
stated in another email that MSG_NOCOPY was considered experimental
and thus left out of my patches.
   I measures smp_call_function on my Dual Pentium 350, and it took
   around 1950 cpu ticks.
And this is one of several reasons why the MSG_NOCOPY facility is
considered experimental.
