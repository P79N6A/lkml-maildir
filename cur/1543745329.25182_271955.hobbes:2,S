Well, my reading of socket(2) suggests that it's _not_ supposed to work.
This patch causes sendmsg on SOCK_SEQPACKET unix domain sockets to return
EISCONN or ENOTSUPP as appropriate if the 'to' address is specified. It
also causes recvmsg to return EINVAL on unconnected sockets. This
behaviour is consistent with SOCK_STREAM sockets.
