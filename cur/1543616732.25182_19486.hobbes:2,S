This bounced from lk (due to a malformed address)... apologies for the
resend if you get it twice...  Just wanted to remove a bit of chaos from
the thread. ;)

Hey.
I haven't forgotten about this little bug. :))

Just did a test and it's not masquerading that's causing it. I'll need
to convert my filesystems to ext3 first because the crashes are not
going to be healthy for this box (or me... 45gig HD involved on a
pentium-200) and I'll experiment some more. It may be redirection
that's doing it.
Once I narrow down what is actually causing it I'll back out the patches
you sent, one by one, until it stops crashing.
