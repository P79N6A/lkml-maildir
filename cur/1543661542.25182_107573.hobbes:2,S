Ok, yet another small brick in the wall: this mb has 64bit/66MHz PCI slots. PDC
is only 32bit/33MHz PCI. So it may well be that others are in fact _able_ to
produce a damn lot more data/interrupts than the PDC. I am pretty astonished by
the number of interrupts created by the 3com tg3 cards anyways...
