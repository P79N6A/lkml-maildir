For what it's worth, Netscape's lawyers seem to believe that getting an
export license for 40-bit crypto _source_ is not feasible, although we
can sometimes get away with 128-bit binary export without too much
hassle.
But I, too, would be pleasantly stunned to hear of someone getting an
export license for crypto source from the US gov't.
