Well, people and even novices may be interested in the boot messages and/or can
learn a great deal from them.  But at boot time the messages can be hidden as they
anyway scroll past too fast to read, and are available later by 'dmesg'. Even the
init log is available for anyone to read. It would be nicer if the messages were
displayed on if a critical error occurred.

The 'startup screen+ progress bar' can be enabled for all stable kernels once
Linus freezes that version.

Not really! The developers might be 'technical people' (as expected for an OS),
but the users are most definitely an audience worth caring for and most of them
are unaware of even the simplest of OS fundamentals.
