That's a great little improvement, Oleg: my difficulty in understanding
the patch is all due to the obscurity of the original you're improving.
But my but is this: you can go one step further, it's silly to be
repeating the "if (correct_wcount) atomic_inc..." in both the if
and the else clauses.
For several minutes I thought that must indicate we already had a
bug there.  Eventually I realized not: we need deny_write_access()
above to test and deny atomically, then once we've merged or linked
the vma it's securely denying in the vma itself: so before returning
we need to undo our temporary denial.  A brief comment might be
worthwhile, perhaps something like
	/* Once vma denies write, undo our temporary denial count */
	if (correct_wcount)
		atomic_inc(&inode->i_writecount);
