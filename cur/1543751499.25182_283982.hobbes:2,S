This basically means that the i2c client was not registered.

However, this suggests that the driver loaded properly and the base 
address was correctly read from Super-I/O space. This would mean that 
the problem happened later, in w83627hf_detect(). The most likely reason 
for this would be if the region request failed (unfortunately we have no 
message, not even debug, if this happens).

Three things to try, in order:
1* Compare /proc/ioports in 2.6.9-mm1 and 2.6.10-mm1. I suspect that the 
0x290-0x297 range is held by some device in 2.6.10-mm1.
2* Try reverting this patch in 2.6.10-mm1:
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.10/2.6.10-mm1/broken-out/bk-i2c.patch
It does indeed include a change in the way the I/O region is requested. 
It should not make any difference, but maybe we are missing something 
and it actually does.
3* Try a vanilla 2.6.10 kernel and report how it is going.
Thanks,
