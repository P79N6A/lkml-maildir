Sure. I'm sure there's just a slight miscommunication here because
my understanding of Mathieu's attempts goes in the direction of
what you're saying here. He might not have gotten it right, but
that can be worked on.

Ok. So if I get what you're saying here, you'd like to be able to
overload a marker? Can you suggest a macro that can do what you'd
like. I'm sure Mathieu would gladly take a close look at it.

Lots of "if"s in this thread, and this weekend does teach us that
highlighting the problems with other peoples' "if"s is dangerous.
I'm sure you'd agree that concentrating on the areas where there
is agreement would be best.

We did, and I'm sure there's a fundamental misunderstanding here.
It would likely help if you could give a concrete example of how
you would like Mathieu's proposal be changed or, if you don't
like it at all, what you would like to see. Anything purely
technical that will avoid any of the pitfalls generated by
differences in perspective.
Thanks,
