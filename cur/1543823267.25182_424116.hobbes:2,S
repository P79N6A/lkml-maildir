I know its not something you're introducing here, but the naming
convention do_sync_read/do_sync_write is pretty confused (with it
not actually being a sync write and all, in the usual case).
Any chance that could be renamed to something thats a bit clearer,
maybe generic_file_non_aio_read and generic_file_non_aio_write?
There don't seem to be many callsites (so not a huge change) and
it'd seem a good time to do it, alongside these other changes.
