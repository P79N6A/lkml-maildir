Hi esr,
There are a couple of lines of the patch I'm not quite happy with.
> -Windows' Logical Disk Manager (Dynamic Disk) support (EXPERIMENTAL)
> +Windows Logical Disk Manager (Dynamic Disk) support (EXPERIMENTAL)
> -Windows' LDM extra logging
> +Windows LDM extra logging
Not wishing to sound too pedantic, but I did put the apostropes in on
purpose.  "Windows" is a plural noun and the genitive of it is "Windows'".
Of course if it's a limitation of the new config tool I'll understand :-)
(and you'll need to apply the following, too).
-IBM's S/390 architecture
+IBMs S/390 architecture
