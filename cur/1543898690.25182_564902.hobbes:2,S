It seems to be a 32bit system. There is no IOMMU. 
If it has >2GB or so it might be worth trying booting it with mem=2G
and see if it goes away. However if it was the standard VIA DAC issue
you should get problems even with a single interface, so probably
that's not it either.
Most likely it is some sort of hardware bug that we might
not be able to do much about. Have you tried contacting SIL or VIA? 
e.g. if you have some other system with a different chipset it might
be useful to test the SIL controllers in those.
I would perhaps also try a newer kernel.
