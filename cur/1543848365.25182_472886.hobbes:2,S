I don't feel much slowness with STACKTRACE & FRAME_POINTER and
enabling stacktrace filter. But with enabling STACK_UNWIND I feel
big latency on X. (There are two type of implementation of stacktrace
filter in it [1] using STACKTRACE with FRAME_POINTER, and [2] STACK_UNWIND)
I don't know why there is quite difference between simple STACKTRACE and
STACK_UNWIND. I'm about to try to use rb tree rather than linked list in
unwind.
In order to prevent from breaking other userspace programs and to
inject failures into only a specific code or process, process filter and
stacktrace filter are available. Without using them the system would be
almost unusable.
Now I'm stuck on the script in fault-injection.txt with random 700
modules. This script just tries to load/unload for all available kernel
modules. It usually get several oopses or CPU soft lockup now.  It
seems that relatively large number of them involved around driver model
(drivers/base/*). (I hope recent large number of error handle fixes
especially by Jeff Garzik fix them)

Yes. I'm learning from md/faulty and scsi-debug module what they are
doing and how to integrate such kind of features in general form.
