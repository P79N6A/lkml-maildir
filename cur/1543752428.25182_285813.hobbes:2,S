Who would be on the kernel security list if it's to be invite only ?
Is this just going to be a handful of folks, or do you foresee it
being the same kernel folks that are currently on vendor-sec ?
My first thought was 'Chris will forward the output of security@kernel.org
to vendor-sec, and we'll get a chance to get updates built'. But you
seem dead-set against any form of delayed disclosure, which has the
effect of catching us all with our pants down when you push out
a new kernel fixing a hole and we don't have updates ready.
At this time, those with bad intents rub their hands with glee
0wning boxes at will whilst those of us responsible for vendor
kernels run like headless chickens trying to get updates out,
which can be a pain the ass if $vendor is supporting some ancient
release which is afflicted by the same bug.
If you turned the current model upsidedown and vendor-sec learned
about issues from security@kernel.org a few days before it'd at
least give us *some* time, as opposed to just springing stuff
on us without warning.
Thoughts?
