Thanks to Matthew and others responded to my question.  Something still
bothers me:
As Matthew mentioned that Max. lun support for Lunix is limited only by bits
number, 
then 256 lun should be easily to cover.  However, in "scan_scsi()" code in
"scsi.c"
under RH6.0 (Linux2.2.5-15), there is a define for 
	#define max_scsi_luns = 8
and it is used in the scsi device scan process:
	max_dev_lun = (max_scsi_luns < shpnt->max_lun?
			max_scsi_luns : shpnt->max_lun);
which limited max lun support to 8.
If the full bit lun address is supported, then when and how the large lun
number, 
say 256, is being passed to the scsi_scan() function for device scanning?
If the scsi device scan is not through this function, then where the large
lun device is scanned?
Many thanks!

Wrong. 256 (I've done this much with Fibre Channel).
Both these are driven by the bits available in the struct scsi_address
structure.
Further, the NDI framework which everything inside Solaris is shifting to
completely separates addresses out from limitations as the dev_info_t is
constructed by the nexus driver and the address can be arbitrary. In
theory this means that even without changing the target drivers the
a_target, a_lun and a_sublun fields could be recycled to be a flat 32 bit
integer which means you get 4GB seperate addresses *per HBA instance*.

Again, this is trivial. Try doing at least first level SCCLUN with 65535
luns.

The problem is more serious in what you can dig up for device nodes than
actual internal scsi addressing.
