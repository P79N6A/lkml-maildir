I can find out excactly .. on monday. But shouldn't x4 be enough anyway?
wikipedia says 250MB/s pr. lane. And no slots is less than x4, so I

Yes. I started by not running it, but saw that cpu 0 was saturated by
ksoftirqd

Yes..
Cpu12 : 34.2%us,  5.9%sy,  0.0%ni,  0.0%id, 14.5%wa,  1.0%hi, 44.4%si, 
0.0%st
All others have idle time.

I havent dug into that. Probably naive, as I as, I expected som hardware
guys as Sun to have taken care of that, when I bought the recommended
10g card for their own server.
