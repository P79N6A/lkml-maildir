Hi,
here are some changes that freshen I8K driver (Dell Inspiron/Latitude
platform driver). The patches have been tested on Inspiron 8100.
i8k-lindent.patch
- pass the driver through Lindent to comply with CondingStyle requirements
  (4 spaces vs. TAB indentation)
i8k-use-dmi.patch
- use standard DMI handling functions instead of homemade ones. The driver
  now requires DMI data to match list of supported models - this way driver
  can be safely enabled without fear of it poking into SMM code on wrong
  box. DMI checks can be ignored with i8k.ignore_dmi option.   
i8k-seqfile.patch
- switch proc handlig code to seq_file instead of having custom read
  function splitting output to fit into user's buffer.
i8k-cleanup.patch
- use module_{init|exit} instead of old-style module intialization code,
  some formatting changes.
i8k-sysfs.patch
- make i8k a platform device and export temperatiure and both fan states
  as sysfs attributes. Wringing into fan1_state and fan2_state attributes
  allows switching fans on and off without need for special utility.
Please consider for inclusion.
Thanks!
