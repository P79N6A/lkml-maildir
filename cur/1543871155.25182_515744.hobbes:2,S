What ancient version of the driver are you referring to??
CURRENT code has one module_init, and can hook up to several
different kinds of bus glue.  There *is* only one OHCI driver.
It can hook up through several different kinds of bus glue; a
few platforms support more than one way to connect to various
implementations of OHCI.

This already works in the current code ...
