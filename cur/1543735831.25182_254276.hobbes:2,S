No, it's not working. After a reboot, same config, same kernel, same mounts, 
same everything -> No vmware.
Just to summarize. 
* vmware with 2.6.9-rc1-mm5 works.
* vmware with 2.6.9-rc2-mm1 doesn't work.
I'll try 2.6.9-rc2 if anyone wants but since not many people answered my 
messages I guess there's no interest in vmware at all.
