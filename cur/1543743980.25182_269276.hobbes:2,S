Hello module wizards,
If one makes changes to the kernel configuration,
compiles, then attempts to install the new kernel,
there are two possible things that happen.
(1) One does `make modules_install` before `make install`
or...
(2) One does `make install` before `make modules_install'.
In the first case, `make install` may fail because the
loop device module fails to load with:

# insmod -f loop.ko

# dmesg | tail --lines 2
loop: version magic '2.6.9 SMP preempt PENTIUM4 gcc-3.3' should be '2.6.9 SMP PENTIUM4 gcc-3.3'
loop: version magic '2.6.9 SMP preempt PENTIUM4 gcc-3.3' should be '2.6.9 SMP PENTIUM4 gcc-3.3'
# exit

..OR..
The installation seems to work, but the system won't complete
a boot because modules from the previous configuration were used
in the `initrd` procedure.
This all comes about because the new module loading procedure
won't allow (ignores) the "-f" (force) parameter. So, one
is screwed trying to do something simple like substituting
a preemptive kernel for another if there isn't already an
alternate bootable system on the disk.
Please restore the "-f" parameter passed to insmod. It
was there for a very good reason. This allows one
who encounters the module-loading error while installing
the kernel to force the module loading. In this way, the
correct modules are used to generate the new `initrd` image.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
