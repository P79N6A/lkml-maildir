This fixes it for me. I'll have to look at ia32 manual at home, why I
must do pushl %eax & popfl, as NT should be already cleared by
do_debug(). I probably miss something obvious, but I do not think that
adding these three instructions into lcall7/27 fastpath is acceptable.
Without pushl %eax & popfl it behaved much better than originally: 
modprobe started, said that personality-1 does not exist, and then 
system killed init (instead of killing init immediately).
