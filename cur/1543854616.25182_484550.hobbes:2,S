I can reproduce this on 2.9.19-rc5-mm2 with CONFIG_SYSFS_DEPRECATED as
well.

And as virtual_device_parent() fails to do much error checking, we end
up with /sys/devices/rawctl instead of /sys/devices/virtual/raw/rawctl.
raw_init() won't notice anything has gone wrong...
Perhaps it would make sense to create /sys/device/virtual/<class>/
already in class_register() (regardless of whether there will be any
devices for this class) and unconditionally remove it in
class_unregister()? Removing something in _unregister() which was not
created by _register() but by some unrelated action seems a bit
lopsided to me...
