I would prefer this information at the END of the help text,
since it is actually most useful to developers and more advanced users 
and thus equals in value to the old notice how a module is called.
If I call for help, I usually like to know WHAT it is and then WHY I might
need it.
Using the verbose config information and linking to their help texts would 
make it even more user friendly in my opinion.
"depends on:" is not really needed, since you usually cannot select any 
option, where you didn't fulfill the dependencies, AFAICS.
