I also realized that the original code *only*
called ldisc->close if the current ldisc != N_TTY.
So I was wrong in interpreting this as using
ldisc->close to indicate hangup in a general sense
because it does not apply to N_TTY.
So depending on this behavior is wrong,
and implementing ldisc->hangup is the way to go.
I'm working on the PPP ldisc now.
