OK, I sent e-mail that wasn't delivered :(. Maybe the unicode `pishyot' was the
problem.
So, could you accurate the version where that occurs first time as much as
possible. I.e. the best is to tell us it is between 2.6.11.5 and 6 or sth.
Then make a diff -u between dmesg -s 1000000 of the 2 versions and attach used
.config.
thanks,
