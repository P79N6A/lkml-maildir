I wondered about that option too.  Let's see if we have other users that
will benefit from adaptive locks -- my gut says that Linus is right, but
then there's a lot of lazy programmers out there using mutexes when they
should be using spinlocks.
I wonder about a new lockdep-style debugging option that adds a bit per
mutex class to determine whether the holder ever slept while holding it.
Then a periodic check could determine which mutexes were needlessly held
would find one style of bad lock management.
The comment in btrfs certainly indicates that locking redesign is a
potential solution:
 * locks the per buffer mutex in an extent buffer.  This uses adaptive locks
 * and the spin is not tuned very extensively.  The spinning does make a big
 * difference in almost every workload, but spinning for the right amount of
 * time needs some help.
 *
 * In general, we want to spin as long as the lock holder is doing btree searches,
 * and we should give up if they are in more expensive code.
btrfs almost wants its own hybrid locks (like lock_sock(), to choose
a new in-tree example).  One where it will spin, unless a flag is set
to not spin, in which case it sleeps.  Then the 'more expensive code'
can set the flag to not bother spinning.
