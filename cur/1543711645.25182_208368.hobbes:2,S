I based it on rmk's set of arguments to his functions; I'm hoping for
feedback (or another API/implementation) from him and hopefully at
least one other arch maintainer having problems in this area. I'm
hoping to focus mostly on the driver sweep, and to devolve e.g. finer
details of the design like the above arguments and/or structures to
those with more detailed knowledge or direct experience (and the
broader details came from elsewhere too).
