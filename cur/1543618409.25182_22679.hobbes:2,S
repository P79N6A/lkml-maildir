Oups, should have quoted my config:
2.4.18-pre4+
linux-2.4.18-NFS_ALL.dif
pnpbios.patch_latest
apm-idle-2.diff
btaudio-2.4.17.diff.gz
bttv-0.7.88-2.4.17.diff.gz
imon-0.0.2-2.4.12-hp
00_nanosleep-5.dif
ide.2.4.16.12102001.patch.bz2
You see, I'm fiddleing with power saving quite some time.
BTW: Would some enlighted kernel brain explain, why 
    [ ]     RTC stores time in GMT
is only available, when APM is enabled. Does this mean, I cannot
define my RTC mode when using ACPI?

Yup, it's called mknbi-linux here :)
I'm going to check ACPI mode without your patch now.
