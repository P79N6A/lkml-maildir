This doesn't mean everything has to be put into a single call. Several 
parameters can still be set after creation.

Why should a subsystem care about the details of the buffer management?
You could move all this into the relay layer by making a relay channel 
an event channel. I know you want to save space, but having a magic 
event_struct_size array is not a good idea. If you have that much events, 
that a little more overhead causes problems, the tracing results won't be 
reliable anymore anyway.
Simplicity and maintainability are far more important than saving a few 
bytes, the general case should be fast and simple, leave the complexity to 
the special cases.
bye, Roman
