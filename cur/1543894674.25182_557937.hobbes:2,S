Well, if it is going to be used in 6 months it's just as easy to add
the code back at that point as it is to remove the  #if 0  bits. Or
simply not remove it in the first place - if it's going to be used in
6 months, all we gain from  #if 0  is slightly smaller binary size for
6 months ... a bit pointless don't you think?

I have no objections to removing dead code. That's a fine objective.
My only concern is that eventually we'll be left with a mountain of
code inside  #if 0  that noone ever cleans up.
I guess I could start grep'ing the surce for "#if 0" at regular
intervals and removing any instances that were added >6months ago...
Something inside me just screams that I shouldn't have to :-)
