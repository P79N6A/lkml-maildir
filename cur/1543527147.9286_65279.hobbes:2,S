OK, that code doesn't *depend* on the list_head being the first member
of the struct (i.e. it always calls list_entry, and takes &drv->node,
etc. where necessary). So it doesn't save you keystrokes but it does
save you a few cycles since you don't need to mess with offsets at
runtime to get to the struct. Cool micro-optimization, agreed.

Can't find a reference to anything like this in CodingStyle...
Best,
