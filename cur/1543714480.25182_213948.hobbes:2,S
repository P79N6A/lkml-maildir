Great, it sure is simpler and cleaner than my workaround. Thanks.

True it is a bios thing but I have yet to see an nforce2 MOBO that is not 
routed in this way. I am thinking it is internal to the chipset. I have seen
none route it into io-apic pin2.

Nvidia is the first Company in my 20+ years of working life to totally not 
respond to my attempts to communicate and I have had dealings with
numerous semiconductor firms and agents. I doubt that my email source 
would be blocked and I have also tried their form mail. Do real people
work there? Maybe I have to phone or fax them from here in Australia?
-or place an order for 10,000 chips? Maybe we need a worldwide union of
Linux support staff to exhibit collective sales pressure. Enough ranting....
I am also cautioned by Maciej's comments indicating that maybe the 
override appears in the nforce2 bios because there is no other way of 
saying this is a feature that nvidia could not get to work properly?...
On the flip side in favour of this routing the clock skew may be restricted
to only to 2.6.1 kerns, I do not have it on my patched 2.4 kerns, it may
be fine on 2.6.5.
Here is a link to the old thread with the skew issues.

Christian - would you please check if you get clock skew as described in
that thread?

Unfortunately the hard lockups in the BUG report won't be fixed by this io-apic
work. I think Shuttle is the only manufacturer to ship a bios update which has
taken a board with existing lockup problems and fixed it. So far nobody has
posted how this magic was done?

In the mean time I and others with lockups have had success with my C1 idle 
patch but I have left it manual with kern arg for the same reason - no clean
way to automate it. Some nforce2 need it, others don't. Want me to finish 
cleaning it up for possible inclusion?
