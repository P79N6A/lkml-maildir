Have the standard frame buffer drivers been abandoned, even
for devices that have no 3D acceleration (like the Geode GX2)?
I took a quick look at the DRM stuff, and it looked like extreme
overkill for what I need, if it even can be used for what I want
to do.  At first glance it looked like this is only relevant for
OpenGL/X11 3D-stuff, which I have absolutely no use for.
GX2 is an integrated CPU/graphics chip for embedded systems.
We have third party applications that use the framebuffer device,
and I was hoping to make things faster by writing an accelerated
driver.  The only thing I need answered is how to access fb_ops
from userspace.  If that is impossible because all the framebuffer
code is leftover junk that no one uses anymore, or even /can/
use anymore because the userspace interface is gone, please let
me know now so I don't have to waste any more time.
