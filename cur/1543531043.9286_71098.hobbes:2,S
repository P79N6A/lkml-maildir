With inciteful quotes such as:
    "Any time you have open source code, you're going to get forking," 
    predicted Bill Eppifanio, an analyst at J.P. Morgan. ...  "Forking 
    will be just as bad for Linux as it was for Unix," he added. 
one has to wonder how much Bill Eppifanio gets paid for his wisdom.
Unix=Closed Source
Linux == Open Source and when it forks, it forks in good ways. :)
