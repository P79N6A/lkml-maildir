Hi,
I had the same problems as Helge Hafting, but they seem to 
be fixed with the two patches posted on this thread. 
Though, I do still have another problem with mm3. My pcm 
device is gone. Xmms can't open alsa, and the device node 
is gone. (it's working fine with vanilla 2.5.69)
Using AMD Athlon 850, with an onboard via82bla soundcard.
Thanks,
Johan Hidding
