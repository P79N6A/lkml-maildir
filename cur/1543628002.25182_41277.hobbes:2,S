Source management systems usually work much better given explicit
control for the user.
ClearCase has MVFS to do what is being suggested. Compare:
    cat a.c                 # currently selected version of a.c
    cat a.c@@/main/5        # version 5 on the main branch
    cat a.c@@LINUX_2.4.18   # the version of a.c selected by the
                            # label 'LINUX_2.4.18'
