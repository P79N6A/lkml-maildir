umm, don't you realize that this just means that the device probing 
scripts go on the initrd? the kernel doesn't magicly decide which drivers 
to load, it uses scripts. especially with legacy and ISA devices there are 
no safe way to probe for them.

this needs to be sent as a suggestion to xorg, but since they run on 
things besides Linux don't expect them to eliminate the config file 
(besides, how else do you override the defaults when you need to)
