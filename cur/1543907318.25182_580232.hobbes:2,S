That's not always true.  DHCP works fine on systems that already have
IP addresses -- address leasing is an _optional_ part of the protocol.
You can use DHCPINFORM to retrieve configuration parameters alone if
you already have an address.
Note that address assignment is technically optional in PPP (IPCP) as
well, so it would be possible to refuse IPCP addresses and then use
DHCP to acquire the needed information.  It'd be strange to do, though.
