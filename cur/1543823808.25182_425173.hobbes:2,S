At least the submit_bh() code should return an error in this case
regardless of who the caller is.  If ext[23] and other filesystems
check this themselves at mount time that is of course also prudent.
Patch has not been more than compile tested but it is a pretty serious
problem dating back a long time so I'm posting it for review anyways.
There are several ways to check for the 64-bit overflow, the efficiency
of which depends on the architecture.  We could alternately shift b_blocknr
by >> 41 or change the mask, for example.  The primary concern is really
the 32-bit overflow and resulting silent and massive data corruption
when CONFIG_LBD isn't enabled.
It is coincidental that mke2fs will clobber the primary group's metadata
(bitmaps, inode table) when formatting such a filesystem, but since this
data is identical at format time (group 0 offsets and group 16384 offsets
modulo 2TB are the same) it is very hard to detect before corruption hits.
