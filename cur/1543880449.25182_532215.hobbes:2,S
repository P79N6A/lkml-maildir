Hi kernel people,
Just upgraded by home box to 2.6.20.7. Wow.
* Reiser3 mount times are drastically reduced,
  even when journal replay is needed
  (I have few 100Gb+ reiser3 partitions mounted at boot)
* sit pseudo-interface is gone. In previous kernel, I tried
  to disable it in kernel config to no avial. Now it was easy
  to simply compile it as a module.
* From make menuconfig questions it looks like SATA/PATA
  rewrite (in the form of libata) is almost finished. Hehe,
  untangling IDE mess was quite a feat, and Jeff did it. Kudos.
Need to check now whether losetup oopses are gone too,
or hunt them down if they are still with us :)
Thanks everybody for your amazing work.
