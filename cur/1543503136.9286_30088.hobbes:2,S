1000Hz or better yet 1024Hz is a good decision because it is the right 
granularity for handling human perception limits. Ie its the right kind
of resolution for games.

On a modern machine (ie reasonable 486+ its definitely a non issue).One
option would be to use 1024Hz on kernels for 586+.

We have extremely precise timing, to the microsecond level and beyond. 
That is different to sleep resolution (tho note that for tiny values its
not worth the effort of sleeping)
