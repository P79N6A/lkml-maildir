Yeah, but as I know, it's a big pain in the butt.  Let's make it easy to
do this, don't make writing a driver tougher than it has to be (it's
already much harder than it used to be.)  Andries's patch makes it easy,
which is a good thing in my book.

Look at drivers/usb/core/file.c::usb_open(), it does much the same
thing.  Well, functionally the same, not identical in any way :)
