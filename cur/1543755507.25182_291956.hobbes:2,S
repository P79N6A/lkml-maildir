Intuitive, perhaps, but I think it's wrong. I don't like it because it
makes string operations depend on slab. Furthermore, kstrdup() is not
a string operation. It is about memory allocation, really, just like
kcalloc().
One possible way to clean this up would be to extract the
standard-like allocators (kmalloc, kcalloc, and kstrdup) from
mm/slab.c and move them into a separate file.
