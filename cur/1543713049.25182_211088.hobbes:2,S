A much more likely schenario is that Solaris is really doing the same
thing we are, but it _also_ ends up opportunistically trying to put the
resultant pages on the IO queues if possible (ie do a "write-ahead": start
writeout if that doesn't imply blocking).
We could probably do that too, it seems easy enough. A 
"TestSetPageLocked()" along with setting the BIO_RW_AHEAD flag. The only 
problem is that I don't think we really have support for doing write-ahead 
(ie we clear the page "dirty" bit too early, so if the write gets 
cancelled due to the IO queues being full, the dirty bit gets lost.
So we don't want to go there for now, but it's something to keep in mind, 
perhaps.

If you check HP-UX, make sure it's a recent one. HPUX has historically 
been just too broken for words when it comes to mmap() (ie some _really_ 
strange semantics, like not being able to unmap partial mappings etc).
