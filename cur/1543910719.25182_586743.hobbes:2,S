Yes, there were some NFS updates in between -rc2 and 
28e8351ac22de25034e048c680014ad824323c65. I'd be now even more curious 
what are you going to find by bisect, please let us know.
I added Trond to CC, full thread to be found at 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/8/21/151
 for reference.
Florin, it also might be useful to capture the states of stuck processess 
via alt-sysrq-T (or better by echo t > /proc/sysrq-trigger), so that we 
know better where are they stuck.
