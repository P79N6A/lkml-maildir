I prefer sector_t for i_blocks rather than newly defined blkcnt_t.
The reasons are:
  - Both i_blocks and common sector_t are for on-disk 512-byte unit.
    In this point of view, they have the same character.
  - If we created the type blkcnt_t newly, the patch would have to
    touch a lot of files as follows, like sector_t does.
        block/Kconfig, asm-i386/types.h, asm-x86_64/types.h,
        asm-ppc/types.h, asm-s390/types.h, asm-sh/types.h,
        asm-h8300/types.h, asm-mips/types.h
    It will be simple if we use sector_t for i_blocks.
Also, I cannot imagine the situation that > 2TB files are used over
network with CONFIG_LBD disabled kernel.  Is there such a thing
realistically?
