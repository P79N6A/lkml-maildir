I didn't say it was a "nice" solution, fully LSB compliant and all.  All
it is is a solution that can work for some people, if they just want a
small, in-kernel devfs-like solution.
And it works just fine for alsa and input devices for me, just no
subdirs :)
Anyway, I'm not offering it up for inclusion in the kernel tree at all,
but for a proof-of-concept for those who were insisting that it was
impossible to keep a devfs-like patchset out of the main kernel tree
easily.
