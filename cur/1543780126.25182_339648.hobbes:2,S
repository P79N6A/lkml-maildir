But why are we in a hurry to dump the backlog on the floor? Why are we
worrying about the performance of netpoll without the cable plugged in
at all? We shouldn't be optimizing the data loss case.
My primary concern here is that the loop have a non-negligible extent
in time. 5 loops is effectively equal to none. I'd be very surprised
if it was even enough for deglitching.
With serial console, we do polled I/O that runs at the serial rate -
milliseconds per line of output.

I think we could probably have subsequent failures be much shorter
without too much added complexity. But I'm not sure it matters.
