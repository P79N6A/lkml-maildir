No, you have to be privileged (root) to edit security policy and to
reload policy.
I mostly don't see this as a serious limitation, because almost everyone
has their own workstation, and thus has root on that workstation. There
are 2 major exceptions:
    * Schools, where the "workstations" are thin client X terminals and
      everyone is logged into a giant shared machine. Sorry, AppArmor is
      not a good choice for that environment, but it is a pretty scarce
      environment.
    * Enterprises, where workers get their own workstation, but they
      don't get root. Well, the reason the worker doesn't get root is
      the enterprise doesn't trust them with it, and so not letting them
      edit security policy is probably a good idea.
Can you explain why you want a non-privileged user to be able to edit
policy? I would like to better understand the problem here.
Note that John Johansen is also interested in allowing non-privileged
users to manipulate AppArmor policy, but his view was to only allow a
non-privileged user to further tighten the profile on a program. To me,
that adds complexity with not much value, but if lots of users want it,
then I'm wrong :)

How to usefully confine an office suite like OpenOffice is current work
at Mercenary Linux. We think we have a solution that is just AppArmor
policy, without having to do any feature enhancements.

You just glob that directory, so the rule would look like:
/home/*/.mozilla/default/*/prefs.js rw,
if you wanted it to be a generic policy for all users. If you want a
tighter policy for your workstation, then it might look like
/home/dagilbert/.mozilla/default/somemozillarandomstring/prefs.js rw,
hard-coding both your username and the random directory name that
Mozilla chose.
