I've never deliberately touched anything in there.  Everything
will have come from RedHat (7.2 CDs) or kernel.org, and I'm
pretty sure I didn't install any interim and/or experimental
versions or patches.

Both machines generally seem to keep time just fine, apart
from the bumps.  But then, there were only a few of the
hardware bug warning messages in the logs, so it didn't
manifest itself very often.
Anyway, nothing caught over the weekend, unfortunately.  The trap
in do_fast_gettimeoffset() reads:
        if ( eax > 100000000 ) {
                glob_eax = eax;
                return delay_at_last_interrupt;
        }
Then a check and printk() in do_gettimeofday().  The machine
has lost NTP synch somewhat sporadically, but not as regularly
as before.  Sigh.  Maybe it's the weather, we've been having a
heatwave since Friday, and everybody and everything in the office
is roasting.
I'm going to try to fiddle around some more, also with the other
machine.
