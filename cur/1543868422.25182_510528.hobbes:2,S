The PCI spec doesn't require 4 seperate interrupts.  They certainly can
all be the same.  I do believe it does require the rotation method on
anything using PCI bridges and such if you want your card to work in PCI
compliant systems since that is how they will assume the lines are
routed and hence will assume that is how to set the interrupts.  If you
make a mainboard on the other hand you can do whatever you want since
you get to design the firmware that assigns the interrupts.

Depends if the riser card is specific to that system, or if it is
supposed to be a generic PCI card.

Well dedicated hardware would be different.  Of course if it is
dedicated the BIOS better do the right thing when configuring it.

It may.  But using just INTB and INTD on a card is not allowed by the
spec as far as I understand it.

Sure.  But if you have a PCI to PCI bridge on a card, then you only get
4 interrupt lines into the card, and you have to distribute them by the
spec to the chips behind the bridge if you want the system to know how
the interrupts should be used (although I guess a driver could do its
own thing if it really wanted to).

It does help make sure that if you have 8 devices, each IRQ is used by
only two devices, so the interrupt handler doesn't have too many devices
to check when an interrupt occours.
