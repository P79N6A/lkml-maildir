I have been using the one in mm for a while and tried the 
one in mjb.  I didn't realize how different it was from the
kgdb in mm at the time.
It didn't work ... Man, I wish I remembered exactly what 
happened ... I think it just hung when I tried to connect 
to the remote target host.
I was connecting with the echo -e "\003" >/dev/ttyS1 method,
and I don't even know if the kgdb in mjb supports that.
