Precedence: bulk

  Hi, all. Version 99.10 of my devfs patch is now available from:
http://www.atnf.csiro.au/~rgooch/linux/kernel-patches.html
The devfs FAQ is also available here.
This work has been sponsored by SGI.
NOTE: the devfs-patch-v99.x patches are maintenance patches for the
2.2.x production kernels. Devfs development is done against recent
development kernels. Occasionally, the latest devfs patch for the
development kernels may be backported to 2.2.x series, but this
happens rarely.
This is against 2.2.13. Highlights of this release:
- Fixed bug in mounting root FS when initrd enabled
- Support fifos when unregistering
- Removed obsolete DEVFS_FL_COMPAT and DEVFS_FL_TOLERANT flags
- Fixed compile problem with drivers/isdn/isdn_common.c
- Removed kmod support: use devfsd instead
- Moved miscellaneous character devices to /dev/misc
- Ensure include/linux/joystick.h is OK for user-space
- Improved debugging in <get_vfs_inode>
- Ensure dentries created by devfsd will be cleaned up
				Regards,
					Richard....
