Hi David,
	The more I looked at this, the more I warmed to it.  I've known for a
while that people are using kallsyms not for OOPS (eg. /proc/$$/wchan),
so we should provide a "grabs locks" version, but this solution gets
around that nicely, while making life more certain for the oops case,
too.
Good work!
Rusty.
