If you force everyone to use 64bit sector numbers, I don't understand how 
you can claim "still working just fine on 32bit"?
At some point ext4 is probably going to be the de facto standard, which 
very many people want to use, because it has all the new features, which 
won't be ported to ext2/3. So I still don't understand, what's so wrong 
about a little tuning in both directions?
bye, Roman
