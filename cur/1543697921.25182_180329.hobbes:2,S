This isn't a performance problem. This is a bug. It vaguely sounds like
a missed wakeup or missing setting of TIF_NEED_RESCHED, but could be a
number of other things too.
(The missing setting of TIF_NEED_RESCHED theory is right if it's
possible to clean up after it by ignoring need_resched() in the
scheduler and always rescheduling.)
