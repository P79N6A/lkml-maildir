Christof, Could you try my patch? I'd like  afew people with
CD-RW to try them. 
It is reachable from
	
http://www.bitwizard.nl/dvd/
You will have to look at how your CD-RW is detected and add some info
about it to the table in scsi.c .

With the patch, and with the "two-lun" approach I think that there
still is an issue with caching.
In either case, the system might be caching say sr0/block1234 then
write sda/block1234 which might invalidate the cache of sr0/block1234,
as they refer to the same physical disk block.
The Matshushita (sp?) DVD RAM drives have a software selectable switch
(non-volatile!) wether or not they will present themselves as two-lun
or not. We have the specs, and are working on a Linux-userland tool
to view/set that switch.
