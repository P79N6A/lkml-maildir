The patch fixes the null pointer access and this ok. But the root
cause seems to be in the cpu hotplug and initialization
code. xxx_start() should not be called before xxx_setup_ctrs() or
after xxx_shutdown(). Also, running only xxx_start() and xxx_stop() in
the cpu notifier functions is not sufficient. There is at least some
on_each_cpu code in nmi_setup() that should be called also in the cpu
notifier functions. I have to review that code.

Ingo, you are right that using kmalloc is unnecessary for
reset_value. So, Andi, maybe you could make this code easier?
