Did you miss the last 20 or so messages in this thread?
We'd like cowlinks that are an invisible filesystem optimisation.
That means you "copy" a file and it behaves the same as if you copy a file.

It is not a question of performance, it's correctness.  Either you
have cowlinks that behave like copied files, or you accept that when
cowlinked files are mmapped and written to, they don't behave like
regular files (not even the original file prior to cowlinking does).
Btw, I'm not suggesting sharing page cache entries.
