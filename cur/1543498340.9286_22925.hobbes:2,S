Hmmm. I'm not sure why. Currently (from what I've seen in this thread) you
have a scheme of /dev/<interface>/<device>/*. What I'm saying is that you
can also have say /dev/<device>/<interface> and let programs cycle through
that. Those that are interested in seeing what's on an interface look in
/dev/<interface>. Those who are looking for a device go for /dev/<device>.
The driver just reports its stuff in two places. The difference is the code
should really be almost nonexistant, no? Or am I getting something phenomally
wrong?
