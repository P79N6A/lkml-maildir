Hi,
This is a kernel bug-report. If this bug is my mistake i apologize...
About: Out of memory error for all processes on kernel 2.2.11.
I have tried to use kernel 2.2.11 on my communications system. After a few
hours of operation, the server locks up (it doesn't oops) with messages
like 'out of memory for crond', 'out of memory for squid' enz. It dumps
these messages on the console, but not in the syslog, for (almost) every
running process. When this happens, the machine is totally unusable. The
network however, is still up because i can ping the machine. Telnet, and
all other network services don't work any longer. I have another machine
with the same hardware, but with less programs running also on kernel
2.2.11. So far this machine works fine (It has been up now for 6 hours,
so it could still crash...). I guess its some bad combination with this
kernel and some piece of software. On kernel 2.2.10 with the exact same
software
everything works just fine.
I'm running the following software:
Squid 		(V2.2 P4)
Sendmail 	8.9.3
Leafnode 	1.9.2
Samba 		2.0.5a
MySQL		3.22.20a
