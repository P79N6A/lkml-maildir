A Gopher server is much more suited to this - why bother with the
complexity of a web server just to allow remote access to
configuration info?  It also means that the remote device has to be
one that can deal with HTML.
Gopher would easily scale down to devices as simple as mobile phones,
wrist watches, and LCD panels easily, and be usable over a very slow
link.
