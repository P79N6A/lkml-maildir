I personally like staircase, i also used to use nicksched but i prefer
staircases simple design and structure. Nicksched was pretty fast but
twiddling around all day with renicing X and now the HT issues are
annoying and staircase has always worked perfectly for me without
flipping fifty switches in the cockpit.
