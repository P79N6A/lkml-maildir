Guys,
Thx for the inputs...I got it with path_lookup....
Can I pass the inode pointer back to the user space???
I have a scenario in which I have to create multiple
folders on the harddisk. The number of folders can be
in hundreds. Instead of parsing the path name
everytime I need to create a folder (that's what
sys_mkdir does??? ), I was thinking if I have the
inode* of the parent folder, I can avoid this parsing
and directly create a subfolder under the parent
folder...
Pls advice if this approach makes sense or not and if
it is doable or not??
any input in this regard will be very helpful..
