Hi,
this fixes the problem when configuring the ISDN-Section f.e. with make menuconfig.
So Capi can be enabled and can be compiled.
Without this patch 2.5.20-dj2 (and a few -dj-Patches before) won't compile Capi-Drivers.
(Note: I don't know why DJ dropped these lines, but in the 2.4.20 they are)
This patch is against 2.5.20-dj2
