I perfectly agree, still I'm not happy with deleting the local routes
for the temporarly orphaned secondaries without notifications and
just re-add them again later.
I think we should either prevent the deletion of the local routes by
rewriting their preferred source address during promotion or explicitely
announce the temprary orphaned secondaries as down and up again in order
to have the local routes deleted/re-added in a clean way.
