VMnet and VMppuser drivers are completely standalone and can work
without VMware. You can persuade VMmon module to load and execute
arbitrary code on kernel level - it just provides virtual machine
environment (switches CPU context), but as it even does not link to
anything else, I do not see any problem here. DRI drivers also allows
you to smash arbitrary piece of memory...
As for license on these modules - I was under impression that they are
under GPL, but I'll ask VMware for clarification.
