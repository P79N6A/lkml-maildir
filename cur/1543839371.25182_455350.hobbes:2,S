I call them "Memory Nodes", or "nodes" for short when the qualifier
"memory" is clear from the context.
I was just reading up on FB-DIMM memory, and notice that each DIMM on
a channel has a different latency.  That sure looks like the defining
characteristic of NUMA memory to my way of thinking - non-uniform memory.
So for extra credit if your fake numa nodes pan out, it would be cute if
the fake nodes could be defined so as to respect these latency
differences - memory in different nodes if at different positions along
a memory channel.  Then a sysadmin could put their most latency
sensitive jobs on the DIMMs closest to the CPUs.
