Hi !
Hopefully I'm right here.....
I have some trouble to get agpgart working in kernel 2.4.20-ac1.
My setup:
- ASUS A7V8X with VIA KT400 Chip (AGP 8X)
- ATI Radeon 9700 PRO (also AGP 8X)
The original 2.4.20 kernel doesn't know this chipset, so I tried the
2.4.20-ac1, which has some patches for the KT400.
With 2.4.20-ac1 I get the following error:
agpgart: Maximum main memory to use for agp memory: 690M
agpgart: Detected Via Apollo KT-400 chipset
agpgart: unable to determine aperture size
