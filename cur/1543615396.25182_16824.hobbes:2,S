Hi there,
probably an often asked question and you are most probably tired of it, 
but...
I want to learn how the kernel works and how things build on top of one 
another. And here I am looking at the source tree and not knowing where 
to start. The 'Documentation' folder would probably be a good bet but 
after that? I suupose, I could go see what is in the 'drivers' directory 
but I don't think taht I would understand much of it if I don't know how 
the things below work. So where should I start reading the source? 
Somewhere in the 'kernel' dir? Or in 'include'? or in 'asm'???
I would appreciate any useful advice, thanks in advance
Todor
