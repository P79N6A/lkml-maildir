Subject: [PATCH] non-linear frame buffer read/write access
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/1/3/395

While the code in fbmem.c allows for hooking read/write access
to non-linear frame buffers by means of fb_read and fb_write
in struct fb_ops, I could not find a way tho access the actual
frame buffer memory from within these routines. I therefore
had to patch fbmem.c, to be able to retrieve a pointer to
struct fb_info from the 'file' argument to these functions.
The second hunk of the patch is not strictly required, I only
did that for symmetry reasons (and the code is somewhat
shorter).
Patch is against 2.6.14
