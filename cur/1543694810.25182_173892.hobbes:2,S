I don't think it is a special request. I added this debug hack:

The result was:
        flags:50 sector:186920 cmd:28 00 00 00
        Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address 5a5a5a66
         printing eip:
        ...
Note that:
        0x50 == REQ_CMD | REQ_STARTED
        0x28 == GPCMD_READ_10
So this looks like a regular read request to me. I'm not sure if this
means that something else is wrong.
