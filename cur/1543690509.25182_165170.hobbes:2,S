I considered that when writing the patch, but: is_prefetch is a single byte 
memory access for something already in cache. Checking for an Athlon
CPU needs two memory accesses in boot_cpu_data at least (checking vendor
and model) 
So checking for Athlon first would be actually more expensive for other CPUs.
The switch is left in the noise, gcc compiles it to very efficient code.
This ignores the possibility of a recursive fault in the __get_user, but these
are rather unlikely. Normal page-on-demand code faults are handled 
before is_prefetch is reached.
