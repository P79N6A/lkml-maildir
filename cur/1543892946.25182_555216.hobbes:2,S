Which you seem to think is a bad thing, yet is actually a very good thing
because it means that crashes are repeatable and problems are debuggable
from end user reports.
Trying to randomize filehandles for the general case is not a productive
activity. If you want to debug cases write yourself a glibc wrapper that
does annoying things but don't inflict it on people who actually want to
build working, testable, debuggable systems (ie most of us)
