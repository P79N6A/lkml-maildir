	Bit rot does occur in unmaintained Linux kernel drivers; I
believe I've seen it happen.  More immediately, though, is that the
driver suddenly stops working (in effect) for new users who can no
acquire a copy of the proprietary codec module, pwcx.  Without pcwx,
my brand new Logitech Web cameras are likely to be seriously crippled.
I didn't get a copy of pcwx before the website that distributed it
shut off access.
	I'm seriously considering offering Nemosoft money for a
licence for pwcx.  Of course, I'd need seperate copies for x86 and
x86_64 architectures...  Economic rationality rears its ugly head:
the overhead costs might be too high.
