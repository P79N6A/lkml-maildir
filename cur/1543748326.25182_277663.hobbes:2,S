Sounds like crash dumping.  I think they've already run into and
addressed the same general problems.  
See crashdump-*.patch in here:

[Jon M. Hanson] Even looking at the implementation of the crashdump
code, I still encounter the same problem I've run into up until now: the
crashdump code is a part of the kernel so it has access to all of the
kernel's data structures and functions; as a kernel module, I'm
hamstrung by what is exported by the kernel. I know that I can modify
the kernel to export whatever I want but I don't want to have to do
that. I want to be able to run my kernel module without having to patch
the kernel itself.
