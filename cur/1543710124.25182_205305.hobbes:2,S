Well, with [1], I know most of those apps aren't being used, so I'm sure 
it should be hitting swap more.
And with [2], it isn't fair since I'm just happy it's not swapping 
throughout the day and all of userspace is in ram, but it's probably not 
good either.  And I'm sure there are some gettys and such that aren't 
being used, so they should have swapped out by now.

Yep, saw that.  Especially with 128MB Highmem (eg, 1G RAM)

If I have enough pressure, they will be eventually?  But my caches will 
still be smaller than optimal, right?

Has akpm said that he would be including the active split patch in -mm?
Do you have a patch against -mm (you wrote to ask for your latest...)?
