Hi,
I was trying to install kdb patch to my 2.2.14-12 kernel
(kdb_v0.6-2.2.13)and it
successfully completed the patching operation but had the following error
messages.
[root@juhie linux]# patch -p1 < /home/dssp/kdb_v0.6-2.2.13 patching file

What are the reasons for the failure? This is the first time I am
applying a patch. Please tell me if just compiling the kernel sources and
booting the machine from the new kernel will have the kdb enabled.
Thanks in advance,
Warm regards,
