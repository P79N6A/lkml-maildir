Ok. Sounds fair.

I looked but it started looking like I was going to over-engineer.

Actually I was quite aware of how frequently this hits. What I found in 
practice was that the amount of dirty ram was an extraordinarily good marker 
of whether the system was globally idle / low stressed or not. It did not 
seem to stop prefetching from occurring in the real world on the machines I 
tried it on.

I guess. The timer just made it easy to start and stop it completely before I 
turned prefetch into a daemon and it kinda stayed that way. It's not run that 
frequently and only does miniscule things in that context; is it of a 
significant advantage?
Thanks very much!
