Subject: [patch netdev-2.6] skge: return 0 on success from SkGeChangeMtu

The SKGE driver needs to return 0 from SkGeChangeMtu() on success.
Signed-off-by: John W. Linville <linville@tuxdriver.com>

The proper sucessful return code for the change_mtu() method is zero.
For some reason, SkGeChangeMtu() is returning the new mtu value
instead.  The comments would seem to indicate past problems, but the
current correct behaviour is clear.
