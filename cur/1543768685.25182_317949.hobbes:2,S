Hi Andi,

Maybe.

Ditto.

Yep.

At least whilst this is getting polished, its worth keeping these
around. Once its stable, I agree, they can go (or at least be
demoted to dprintk's).   It seems that theres some problems with
the current code, so they're definitly useful..
for eg..
CMAP: cmap_request_range: 0xf8000000 - 0xf8100fff (1)
CMAP:     cachings mismatch (4 != 1)
CMAP: cmap_request_range: 0xf8101000 - 0xf8101fff (1)
CMAP:     cachings mismatch (4 != 1)
CMAP: cmap_request_range: 0xf8102000 - 0xf8301fff (1)
CMAP:     cachings mismatch (4 != 1)
[drm:radeon_do_init_cp] *ERROR* could not find ioremap agp regions!
CMAP: cmap_release_range: 0xff8f0000 - 0xff96efff
CMAP:    last user, freeing
CMAP:    last user, freeing
CMAP:    release_range successful!!
I'm not sure where that's coming from yet.  There's also a few
failures to release regions which need to be double checked.

Asides from cmap_entry->count ?
Hmm, there doesn't seem to be anything guarding concurrent accesses
to that.

By hooking into ioremap(), we're getting this done automatically.

*nod*, and if it should, lose the ifdef completely.

agreed.  There's a bunch of errata on older CPUs that should probably
be checked too.
Thanks for the comments.  I'm not working on this full-time, but
I'll continue to poke at it occasionally, especially if theres
interest from anyone else.
