Then why do we define rules that we know that nobody will (be reasonably 
able to) adhere to?
I can see the reasoning behind using spaces instead of tabs in 
continuation lines and in in-line indentation like
	int x   = 1;
	void *c = NULL;
or
#define X  1
#define XY 2
although I personally perfer TABs there too. But as long as we do not want 
to actually impose that, I don't think we should define that.
Whereas an explicit rule requesting to use TABs and not spaces for 
different indentation levels seems good.
Thanks
