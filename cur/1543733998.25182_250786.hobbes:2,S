Hi,

With preempt off profile_pc works as expected, timer ticks in spinlocks
are apportioned to the calling function. Turn preempt on and you end up
with one big bucket called __preempt_spin_lock where most of the
spinlock ticks end up.

At the moment profile_pc is simple and only looks at the timer interrupt
pt_regs. With 2 levels of locks (_spin_lock -> __preempt_spin_lock) we
now have to walk the stack. Obviously fixable, it just a bit more work
in profile_pc. We would also need to move __preempt_spin_lock into the 
lock section which should be fine if we change wchan backtracing to do
as you suggest.
