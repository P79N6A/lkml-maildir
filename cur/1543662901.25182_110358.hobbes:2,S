I stand corrected; You quote an extra cost service without the fair 
usage stuff. I should have read more carefully. You'll concur that the 
lesser cost packages have usage limits though. (which was my intended point)
It's interesting though that multiplying your quoted £300/month 2Mbps 
connection up to an unlimited 10Mbps connection gives......£1500/month!
My original argument stands. NOBODY is doing an uncontended, unlimited 
bandwidth service for 50 euros. :)
