Yes, by using fixed addresses, which is not what I want.

Wow. I'm impressed because I'm pulling my opinion out of thin air.

Look at your own drawing.

Repeating patterns do not impress me. Your drawing tells otherwise

Neither LILO nor GRUB have search capabilities for randomly located
second stage loaders.

Sigh. Layering violation == flexibility.

I know how it works. But your blurb does not answer any of my questions.

I see, you define, what has to be discussed.
