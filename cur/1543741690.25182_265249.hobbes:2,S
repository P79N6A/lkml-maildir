the latter. jackd has one RT thread for doing the grunt work and one which
acts as a watchdog. The other two are SCHED_OTHER by design.

Hmm, you're right. It seems that diskload alone doesn't trigger the problem.
it rather looks like graphics output/activity is the problem.
Anyways i'm back in U3 w/o PREEMPT_REALTIME as V0.3.2 just hardlocked on me
when i pressed ctrl-d in a root shell (in an xterm) to exit. Nothing has
made it to the log. I haven't found out yet whether it's possible to use my
old zx81 as serial console, so i can't help with OOPS/BUG output.
