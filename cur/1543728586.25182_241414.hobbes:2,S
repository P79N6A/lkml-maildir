Hi Andrew, hi Ed!
The problem persisted with 2.6.8-rc4-mm1, always (repeatable 100%) after
around 30 scans the computer freezes completely. Not even sysrq works.
But at least what I could check was that it is not a memory problem,
there is still enough swap free (close to 1G).
So what can I do, any ideas?
