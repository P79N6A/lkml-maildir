That is something I have been looking for for a long time as long as
filehandle won't change because of reboot, rename nor hardlink. I
know my knfsd is not the perfect solution. But it is better than the
broken one in 2.2.x if you have none-Linux clients. Thanks to knfsd,
the Linux NFS server did not do too bad at Connectathon 99.
