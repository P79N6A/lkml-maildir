I hope that someone can shed some light here, or give me a way to
investigate. 3 computers, 2 are 2.2.6, 1 is 2.0.36. All ethernet. 2.2.6 has
PCI vortex, 2.0.36 has Intel ether express 16. Lots of the following in logs:

inx is the 2.0.36 kernel. This came from copying a file from either mwg or
support to inx. I get a lot of server not responding from mwg and support,
too. Everything is user NFS daemons, because I can't get the kernel daemons
to export all the mount points: kexportfs gets an invalid argument on mount
directories from the kernel. The backup last night (tape drive is on inx)
did not finish because of these problems.
