I think we'd all appreciate it a lot if, instead of pointless code churn
in socket.c, you used it to fix an *actual* problem - like any of the
many places where we have issues with interleaved output in dmesg because
a function had to use 2 or 3 printk calls to build up a line.
In your 0/3 you point at sound/core/misc.c and drivers/cpufreq/cpufreq.c,
both of those would be better than socket.c
