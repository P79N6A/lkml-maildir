This is at best a marginal solution to a complicated MacOS problem. It'll create
alot of a small space waste given how the Macintosh organizes fork data.
Unix folks should live with stuff like BeOS for a couple of day and see how
important it is to have files with additional properties, forks and it's MIME
interaction.
The BeOS, once it's successfully launched a MIME handler on a *.mp3 file
it then marks a MIME property within that file as an mp3. This allows for
that very same file to recognized regardless of renaming, etc..., after
writting it's MIME associated property.
It's really no different than the ACL storage issue and should be solved
all at once without the 7+ year committee lag associated with getting 
extended features in Unix land.
Most of the negative flamage against multi-fork files seems comes from folks
that don't know much about Macintosh GUI programming and specifically *why*
is important to have it. You'll never want to go back to it once you've
lived with it.
