OK, I've had a look. There is indeed a race there. While it is safe
against module unloading, it isn't safe against removal of entries
from the directory. I'm considering some different options to fix this
(one is simple and obvious, the other will be a little more
efficient).
Question: can invalidate_device() and the bdops methods
check_media_change() and revalidate() be called with a lock held?
