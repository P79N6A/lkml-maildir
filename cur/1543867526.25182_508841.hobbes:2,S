That is exactly what I described as clets. Instead of having complex jump 
and condition interpreters on the kernel (on top of new syscalls to 
modify/increment userspace variables), you just code it in C and you pass 
the clet pointer to the kernel.
The upcall will setup a frame, execute the clet (where jump/conditions and 
userspace variable changes happen in machine code - gcc is pretty good in 
taking care of that for us) on its return, come back through a 
sys_async_return, and go back to userspace.
