My machine's clock runs about 2X from normal speed.
Could you try my patch which I just posted a hour ago?
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=113249769027262&w=2
The patch will detect whether IO-APCI timer interupt is generated too fast 
and try to use a legacy i8259A IRQ instead.
It might help. It also worked on 2.4.31 kernel for me.
