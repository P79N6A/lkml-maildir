Can you try the attached patch please? Patch is against 2.4.18.
It makes the AM53C974 driver register its IO-space and will make detection
fail, if there are no adapters found with available IO-space.
The tmscsim driver (which I maintain) does already register its IO space
correctly, so this patch should make sure that not both of them try to drive
the same piece of hardware.
Please report back, whether it works, so I can ask Marcelo to include it.
Regards,
