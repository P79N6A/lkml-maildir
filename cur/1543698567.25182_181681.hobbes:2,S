Yes, so?

That is what I do.  My program takes hints saying "this recursion can
only loop n times".  But I don't want to add semantic checking of the
source itself, so a human has to give the hint.  Also, the human has
to uniquely hint at a single recursion.
If you accept this approach, there is no way to deal with multiple
linked recursions like this:
a->b->c->d
      `->b
The human would have to say something like "the big recursion can only
happen five times, unless the short recursion from c to b happened.
In this case...".  No thanks.
In fact, most recursions in the kernel are functions calling itself
again, there are just a few over several functions.  So I honestly
wonder if recursion over multiple functions should be handled by my
program at all, or if I should just warn when seeing them.
There might be valid cases for two or three functions involved, so I
am not sure yet.  But I sure as hell won't handle those cases before
seeing a valid use first and the one causing this thread sure isn't.
