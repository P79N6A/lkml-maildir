I'll certainly listen when the patches go in.
I'll rerun my analysis to catch most of the problems. But I will allways 
be late by two or three days because the analysis takes it's time.
The (well-known) problem is that at the time when patches are allowed to 
go in, the rate of change is so high that I need to fix some dozen files 
per day.
In a more quiet period (e.g., two or the days after most of the changes 
are in), I'd probably be able to catch most (if not all) of the problems 
by myself with
We'll see how it goes.
I'd really like to get the procedure right as my next patch to really cut 
down sched.h (ab)use will affect about 10x as many files.

OK. I'll not update the changelog now as it will be out of date anyways 
when 2.6.15 arrives.
