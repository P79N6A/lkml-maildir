Strange. Here I've got problems with my mouse being actually 'to fast'
(when working with X-Window; I had to slow it down about 2 times via
xset to be able to work 'normally'; Actually -since I could not find
any related bugreports or complains - I thought it was something with 
how my version of X works with new layer)
