If you are building a stable system and you test it and it passes
extensive testing you don't care if it works because of a specific
pattern of accesses since your testing shows that it continues to work.
If you randomize these it becomes fundamentally untestable. There is a
role for this in fuzz testing but there is not a role for it in normal
production behaviour.
Please consign the whole funky file handle farce to the bucket labelled
"dumb ideas". I know its a bit full but there is room in there for more -
unlike the kernel.
