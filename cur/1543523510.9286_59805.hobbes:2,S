The reason why I added it to umount is that I wanted to have transaction
semantics, such that things don't get weird if we hit a problem in the
middle. But this is not strictly necessary, I agree.

I see what you mean. This takes away the possibility of detaching
multiple directories at the same time, e.g. if I have /, /new-root,
and /proc, and then I make a chroot to /new-root, I can still reach
the former /new-root (now /), but /proc is lost forever.
This can be avoided by allowing access via block devices, a la
umount, which should probably be implemented using umount and a new
flag ;-) What do you think ? I kind of like to allow people to
recover from their mistakes. Also, this avoids the introduction of
a new system call, ioctl, or such.

Does this objection also apply to MNT_CHROOT ? This could of course
become something like chroot2("new-root",pid), but it seems a bit messy
to me if the user has to track down all the kernel threads first (and
that repeatedly, because some of them may have spawned new threads
during the scan).

Hmm, how would you handle this:
 - we start with  / (mounted from hda1), /newroot, /proc
 - exec chroot /newroot /bin/sh </newroot/dev/console etc.
   mount -t proc /proc /proc
   cat /proc/mounts
1) The old behaviour would have yielded /, /proc, /newroot, /proc
2) Only d_path would yield: /, /proc, /, /proc
3) My approach yields: 03:01/, 03:01/proc, /, /proc
1 and 2 have ambiguous entries. 3 changes the syntax for those entries
for which no valid path name exists under the current root. In addition
to that, only 3) gives you the information you need to unmount the old
/ and the old /proc (if you allow this case).
Would you prefer simply the device numbers, without path, e.g.
03:01, 00:01, /, /proc ?
Cheers, Werner
