I do agree with Rik here.  Once the basic rmap infrastructure is merged
we need to work on implementing stuff on top of it or else there is no
point.
If we cannot show the infrastructure is useful, then Linus will surely
rip rmap out of the kernel in time.
Summary: once it is in and seems correct we need to start providing (in
_pieces_) parts from Rik's full rmap patch and other VM-related code for
2.5 to see where rmap can take us...
