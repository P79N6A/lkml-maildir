This is not true any more. If there's both a SCSI and IDE
model of the same hard drive, you can bet that they both
use the exact same drive mechanics. The only exception
here are the ultra-cheap-cut-all-corners IDE-only drives
and the rediculously-high-end SCSI-only drives...
What _is_ true, however, is that you cannot just turn off
a hard drive that's been running 24x7 for ages. When a
disk is turned off its heads go to the `parking zone', an
area of the disk which has a wavey surface so that the
heads can get rid of the dust they gathered without getting
stuck to the surface (sticktion).
However, a 24x7 drive often has gathered so much cruft on
the heads that it'll stick even in the parking zone. The
solution is to do a short (30 sec) poweroff and get running
again for a few minutes before the long poweroff. That time
the heads can shake off most of their dust without getting
the time to stick...

It has, as usual all the rules have changed :)
