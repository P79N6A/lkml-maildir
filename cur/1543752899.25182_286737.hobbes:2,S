You have previously demonstrated that you do not understand the
implementation you are criticizing. You keep repeating the size
of the patch like a mantra, yet when pressed for actual bits of
code that need fixing, you use a circular argument to slip away.
If you feel that there is some unncessary processing being done
in the kernel, please show me the piece of code affected so that
it can be fixed if it is broken.
