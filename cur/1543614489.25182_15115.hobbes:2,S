    Hello all :))
    An unusual question about Linux...
    I want a radio card for linux, just a *radio* card, not a TV-FM
combo. I've seen that the Aimslabs RadioTrack is fully supported by
the kernel, but I don't know about other brands and models.
    My question is: what radio card models (PCI, please) are fully
supported by the kernel and *where* can I buy them? I don't find any
Linux supported radio card in the stores here in Spain...
    Thanks a lot :))
    Raúl
