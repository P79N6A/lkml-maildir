XFree86 uses backcalculation. So if Atyfb programs the chip at 50 MHz,
XFree86 will read 50 MHz back. So, 50 MHz is not necessary the right
frequency for your chip.

Hmmm. No clocks here at the first sight.

Hmmm. Catch-22; Geert's VAIO malfunctions at 50 MHz :/
We can do two things:
- Check the PLL registers at startup and determine your frequency.
- Ask ATi again.
I propose to do both. Please enable the debug define in atyfb_base.c, so
it will print PLL registers.
I'm going to write an e-mail to ATi devrel now, I will cc to all except
linux-kernel.
