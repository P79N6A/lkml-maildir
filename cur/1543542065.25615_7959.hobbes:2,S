Hi Jeff,
Good stuff, but what I am still wondering is whethere is indeed anything
in UnixWare (or any other commercial UNIX) that can be used to improve
Linux. Pray do tell us, what do you think such areas might be?
At the moment, I can't think of any, and I did work as a UnixWare7 kernel
escalations engineer for 2 years :)
Regards,
Tigran
