I suspect it's simply generalizing the concept of a registered interface.
Suppose you had *one* data structure that described *all* interfaces this  
module supports, and you call *one* (un)register function to do the job.
Then, you are essentially in the same situation as you are today when you  
support exactly one fs, no?
Of course, this registration abstraction must be powerful enough to do  
everything you can do today without it, but that's just a SMOP ...
