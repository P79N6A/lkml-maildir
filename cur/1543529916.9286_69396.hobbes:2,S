   Hi, I'm having a problem with the raid0 features of the latest Linux
kernels. (2.3.50, 2.3.51 and 2.3.52-prewhatever). Basically when I do
"mdadd -ar" on bootup I get:
/dev/hde5: no such device
/dev/hdg5: no such device
/dev/md0: no such device
   However, I can operate on the /dev/hde5 and /dev/hdg5 block devices
just fine otherwise. It seems as if the md interface to the kernel has
changed recently, since the md-tools no longer compile with these kernels
either? I thought the recompile would be the problem, since maybe some
IOCTL commands changed or something. Do I need a completely newer version
of the md-utils? (I can't find anywhere in the docs where it says so or
where to get them). Is this a known problem?
(P.S. what happened to raid1, 4, 5)
