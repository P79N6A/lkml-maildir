Subject: [patch] FLAT binaries: drop BINFMT_FLAT bad header magic warning
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The warning issued by fs/binfmt_flat.c when the format handler is given a
non-FLAT and non-script executable is annoying to say the least when working
with FDPIC ELF objects.  If you build a kernel that supports both FLAT and
FDPIC ELFs on no-mmu, every time you execute an FDPIC ELF, the kernel spits
out this message.  While I understand a lot of newcomers to the no-mmu world
screw up generation of FLAT binaries, this warning is not usable for systems
that support more than just FLAT.
