Hi Maxwell,
A system will launch PIO and if there is a driver it will be feature
enabled to max performance and auto scaled if there are problems
encountered.
The current code has a mistake that is not fatal, but regardless wrong.
Ultra 100|66|44|33|25|16 -- MW DMA 2|1|0 -- SW DMA 2|1|0 -- PIO4 
        5  4  3  2  1  0 
The fault is that you lose the iCRC features in Ultra so dropping to
Multi/Single word DMAs only gain speed w/ out a safety net.
The current patch code series does a single reduction of transfer rate per
counting 10 iCRC events, and no other errors are allowed.
Ultra 133|100|66|44|33|25|16|---PIO4
	6   5  4  3  2  1  0 ---
You need to enable the chipset code otherwise the driver will not allow
DMA to run in a sane mode.
