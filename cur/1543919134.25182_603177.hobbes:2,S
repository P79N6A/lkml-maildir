If your target is a SCSI target you can gain up to 15% by using
sg. Search on the net for the "sg utils" package. The source code
of sg_dd and others are a grate example of how to do it.
Other wise O_DIRECT is your friend. Also look for asynchronous
I/O so you have a few pending IO buffers to keep the pipes full.
