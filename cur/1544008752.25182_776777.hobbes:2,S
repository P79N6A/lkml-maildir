> At the moment, the times() system call will appear to fail for a
> period shortly after boot, while the value it want to return is
> between -4095 and -1.  The same thing will also happen for the time()
> system call on 32-bit platforms some time in 2106 or so.
> 
> On some platforms, such as x86, this is unavoidable because of the
> system call ABI, but other platforms such as powerpc have a separate
> error indication from the return value, so system calls can in fact
> return small negative values without indicating an error.  On those
> platforms, force_successful_syscall_return() provides a way to
> indicate that the system call return value should not be treated as an
> error even if it is in the range which would normally be taken as a
> negative error number.
> 
> This adds a force_successful_syscall_return() call to the time() and
> times() system calls plus their 32-bit compat versions, so that they
> don't erroneously indicate an error on those platforms whose system
> call ABI has a separate error indication.  This will not affect
> anything on other platforms.

> Joakim Tjernlund added the fix for time() and the compat versions of
> time() and times(), after I did the fix for times().
