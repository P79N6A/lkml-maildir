Just in general, if there is anything a non-root user can do to crash 
the system, it's probably a kernel bug by definition. It doesn't matter 
that's it a stupid thing to do, it might be malicious. And in this case 
it might just be user error.
Glad someone is working on locking, bozos and evil-doers abound ;-)
