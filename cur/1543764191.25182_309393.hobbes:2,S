The 1 Megabyte of DMA RAM needs to be aligned on 1 MB, since I have to
tell the (software) cache manager to make it uncacheable (and that works
in blocks of 1M or 4M).
I probably could allocate 2M, get the alignment correctly, then free the
pages I don't need/want, and feed that range to the cache manager.
I'm not entirely sure I can do that before the call to free_all_bootmem,
since all pages are reserved before that.
Is there a way to do this directly (eg, just nab the pages I want/need,
and tell the zones not to use them?)

That's my backup plan, but I'd prefer to do it properly in kernel memory
space (if at all possible).

BlackFin doesn't have PCI (and no MMU, so a more limited address space
than 4 GB).
Thanks for the insight so far,
