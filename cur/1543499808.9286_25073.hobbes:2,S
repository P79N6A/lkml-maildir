I'm looking for something that could be used to construct a system unique
identifier for a linux system from within the kernel. My reason for doing
so is to synthesize Port WWNs (world wide name) with a single Node (WWN)
backing it for fibre channel adapters that don't have WWNs assigned in
NVRAM to them.
Similar problems in Solaris are solved by finding the first ethernet
MAC address (actually, just the 'localetheraddr' call) and synthesizing a
WWN out of that. I'd like to do something a bit less hacky/invasive than
this, avoiding all sorts of foolish layering things about going from one
subsystem (SCSI, I/O, Mass Storage) to another (Networking).
Surely this problem comes up for trying to do hostid kinds of things too.
Any suggestions?
