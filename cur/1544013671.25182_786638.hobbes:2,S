If you're going "all the way back to the bourne shell", don't use "set
-- $i"; use "set x $i" instead, and don't expect to do any arithmetic
in the shell; use "expr" or "awk" for arithmetic.
(Not relevant to kernel scripts, imho, since you can always assume
something a bit more modern and not too stripped down).
(I have 850 Linux boxes on my network with a bourne shell which
doesn't do $((...)).  I won't be building kernels on them though :-)
