I have been wondering about the locking stuff for a while too.  These
are probably dumb questions but my OS terminology is not what it could
be.  (Is there a good reference somewhere?)
* Does "lock the kernel" mean "prevent anyone else from executing any
kernel code"?
* If so, what happens if some other CPU is already inside the kernel? 
Is there some mechanism to stop the other CPU??
TIA
