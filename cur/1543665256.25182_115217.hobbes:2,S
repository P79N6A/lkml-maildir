which precise scheduler are you using, BK-curr? And to see whether the
problem is related to scheduling at all, could you try to renice X to -10?
[this is not a solution, this is just a test to see the problem is
scheduling related.]
is there any way we could exclude/isolate the VM as the source of
interactivity problems? Eg. any chance to get more RAM into that box?
