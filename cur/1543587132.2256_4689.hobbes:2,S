all POSIX timer and timer like functions (timer_xxx, nanosleep, alarm etc)
are defined to operate on a 'no earlier than' semantic. i.e. if you ask to
nanosleep for 500 nsec, you will sleep for no less than 500 nanoseconds, but
possibly up to 20,000,500 nanoseconds.  this is because the maximum legal POSIX
time resolution is 20,000,000 nanoseconds (1/50th second or 50hz because of
european electricity and old hardware)
