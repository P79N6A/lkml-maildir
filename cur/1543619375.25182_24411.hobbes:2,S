   Is there a specific maintainer for the TTY code. This is the part of the
kernel which I am most interested in. I have many TTYs in a mid size (100
user Unix network) and could get to do some testing if anyone is writing
patches for this system. I would also be willing to do minor review of code
for spelling and such. I would _really_ like to get involved with this
specific system.
Thanks,
Karl Tatgenhorst
