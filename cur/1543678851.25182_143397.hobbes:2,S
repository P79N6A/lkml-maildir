It does seem a bit out of date talking about PC100. But I found another
source of information:
http://www.memorysuppliers.com/memoryterms.html
Registered Memory
        SDRAM memory that contains registers directly on the module. The
        registers re-drive the signals through the memory chips and
        allow the module to be built with more memory chips. Registered
        and unbuffered memory cannot be mixed. The design of the
        computer memory controller dictates which type of memory the
        computer requires. 
Regarding the last sentence, the Tyan 2466 appears to be able to support
unbuffered memory in slots 1 and 2 only (and the type cannot be mixed of
course). The earlier 2460 doesn't allow anything but registered.
