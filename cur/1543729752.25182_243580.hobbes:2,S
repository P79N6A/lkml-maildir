Well, the stealth compatibility mode is even uglier than VesaFB not
claiming the PCI device, so I don't think it's really worth it for this
reason.
You can just as well enable the stealth mode if you can't get the
resources.

We really need that. And we need it to be able to kick VESAfb out using
sysfs when it loads. For that you'll need to make VESAfb grab the VGA
PCI device.
