No there isn't and we've been over this with Vegard many times :-).
Christoph, can you actually see this in the patch? There shouldn't be
any __GFP_DMA confusion there. What we have is per-object
__GFP_NOTRACK which can be used to suppress false positives for
DMA-filled objects and SLAB_NOTRACK for whole _caches_ that contains
objects which we must not take page faults at all.
