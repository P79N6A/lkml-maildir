And you could have saved the time and effort of replying, as you had
nothing useful to say. Why do you expect kernel users (non-developers) 
to jump through hoops and cripple their systems in order to provide bug
reports? Exactly how could I have tested MPLayer realistically without
Xv support? It isn't that easy to swap video cards in a laptop.
I noticed that after trying a new kernel a user space tool, which
worked fine under earlier kernels, was no longer working. Linus himself
said that this is worth pointing out. I did so. 
Yes, I was very fortunate in that someone else with a non-tainted
kernel noticed a similar bug with /dev/rtc, and even more fortunate
that Steven Rostedt provided a patch that worked for both of us. As I
had said in my original post I was not expecting that, but thought the
bug was worth reporting.
DO YOU REALLY PREFER USERS NOT REPORT BUGS?
