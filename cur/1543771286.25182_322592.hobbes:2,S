Whatever you guys decide to do (I actually do sys_sync() before freezing
on pmac and yes, it takes sometimes way too long), to be uber-safe, we
could/should _also_ do sync after freezing userland processes and before
freezing kernel threads (that is, splitting here). In fact, that would
help also avoid deadlocks where a frozen kernel thread is holding a
semaphore preventing a process from freezing.
That way, if we sys_sync() once processes are sleeping and before kernel
threads are, we pretty-much make sure no new dirty buffer will appear.
Anyway, that's mostly food for thoughts at this point
Ben.
