This is not quite the same thing.  This still does a check for whether 
or not there is enough memory and includes this in the virtual size of 
the process.  I simply want to reserve a part of the address space so 
I'm guaranteed I can map something else over a contiguous portion of the 
address space.  I don't want it to check for available memory or 
increase the virtual size of the process because I will be using this 
region sparsely.  That is why Solaris and Windows have separate 
interfaces for this.
