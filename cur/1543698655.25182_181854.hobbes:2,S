But what about the case I stated earlier for a driver that is completely 
binary portable between different operating systems. Hence the low level 
portion of the driver is not Linux specific at all, and in fact not even 
designed specifically with Linux in mind. That muddies the waters even 
more, and even Linus has said he would believe such a driver to be OK.
