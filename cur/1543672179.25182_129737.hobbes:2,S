I write this to the kernel mailing list, because my question couldn't be
answered on irc (eg. irc.kernelnewbie.org):
____________________________________________________________________________
arch/i386/boot/setup.S:
164 trampoline:     call    start_of_setup
165                 .space  1024
166 # End of setup header
#####################################################
167 
168 start_of_setup:
169 # Bootlin depends on this being done early
170         movw    $0x01500, %ax
____________________________________________________________________________
my questions are:
-)    Why is there a call on line 164 and not a jmp?
-)    Why does line 165 reserve 1024 bytes? what is it for?
-)    On line 170: Why $0x01500 and not $0x1500?
I would appreciate if someone could answer this mail, or if someone can
provide ressources where I can find detailed description of the kernel code
(didn't find anything, just overall information)
regards, 
andy
