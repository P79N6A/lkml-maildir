   What is the proper value for L1_CACHE_SHIFT on sparc64?
   The cache itself is two chunks of 16 bytes each, makes up 32 bytes. On 
   i386, L1_CACHE_BYTES == (1 << L1_CACHE_SHIFT), so if this applies here, 
   too, we have a L1_CACHE_SHIFT of... 5?
Right.  But who needs L1_CACHE_SHIFT?  Nothing generic should
reference it.  Did something get added to 2.5.x that needs it now?
I wouldn't have noticed yet as I've been away for nearly half a month
on vaction until a day or two ago.
