Subject: [2.4 patch] cmpci oops on rmmod + fix
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Below is a patch originally sent against 2.6 by
Krzysztof Rusocki <kszysiu@iceberg.elsat.net.pl> (and already included 
in 2.6.8-rc1).
His explanation of the patch was:
<--  snip  -->
The cmpci driver included in Linux 2.6.7 causes an oops on rmmod,
I believe cm_remove should be marked __devexit rather than __devinit.
<--  snip  -->
This is an obvious bug, and below is my backport of his fix to 2.4 .
While I was editing struct cm_driver, I've also converted it to C99 
initializers (as already done in 2.6).
