I'd like it.

The implementation looks fine to me.  You've checked that it
builds OK with CONFIG_DEBUG_BUGVERBOSE=n?
It's a shame that gcc never seems to have gained full support for
attribute __interrupt__, which, if they did it right, would preserve 
all registers.   gcc-for-PPC seems to support it.
