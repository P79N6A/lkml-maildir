Hi,
As of linux 2.4.21-pre3, bttv driver fails to check the "channel" 
attribute correctly. This is caused because there is no check for 
negative values on the  channel parameter (at least ) in ioctls 
VIDIOCGCHAN (bttv-driver.c:1510) and VIDIOCSCHAN (same file, at line 
1537). Negative parameters, though invalid, are passed along.
While in the first case (VIDIOCGCHAN) I see no dark effects other than 
the wacky channel name in the name member of the returned structure, it 
is possible that passing the negative value in VIDIOCSCHAN spots 
side-effects, specially in the function bt848_muxsel.
(A cc: went to the maintainer. Any questions please cc: me since I'm not 
subscribed to the kernel mailing list).
Best regards,
Alexandre
