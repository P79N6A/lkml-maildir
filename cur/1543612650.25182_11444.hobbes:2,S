Thanks for the response! I'm assuming the N5415 is an AMD Athlon or
Duron based notebook (some are PIII/Celeron). Are you having the same
problem with USB?
WRT the BIOS update, if you have WINE, you can run the .exe (I had to
use the keyboard shortcut for "Next", clicking didn't work). It won't
actually create the update disk, but it will extract the disk image into
an oddly-named directory under your WINE "TMP" directory. Look for
BIOS.IMG. Then run "dd if=BIOS.IMG of=/dev/fd0 bs=32c skip=1" (their
image format has a 32-byte header) and boom, there's your update disk!
It's even bootable.
The following patch will cause your DMI info to be printed to the screen
on boot. If you just apply the patch, recompile, and email (off-list) me
the "dmesg" output, that should be all I need. If you're feeling extra
helpful, email me the output of "dump_pirq" (from the pcmcia-cs package,
in the "debug-tools" directory) and "lspci -vvvxxx", too.
