Yes but we dont want to let them win or next year 16K will be too small and
then they'll want to 16K C++ stack objects. At the very least we should
make them have to use
	really_slow_vmalloc_and_switch_to_big_temporary_stack()
	really_slow_vfree_and_return_to_old_stack()
_and_ make them type function names that long.
Granted its less of an issue in 2.5 because we can afford to finally make
DMA off the stack a crime (right now its an offence but one that is violated
in too many places to be sure of killing them all off) - scsi for one does
it.

Sweet. Now that I'd completely missed. Task private state and task
public state splitting

Yep
