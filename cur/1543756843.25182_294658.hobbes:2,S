I've just conducted a binary search to see when the SIS drm stopped
working... and it was 2.6.9-rc1-bk1 from looking at it the new virtual
memory layout is the most likely patch to have broken things... I haven't
confirmed it is this particular patch yet, tomorrow I'll get some time to
do it ..
The SIS is a quite simple drm, so I'm not sure what has been broken, Ingo
can you think of anything that this patch might do to the drm,
the bug is that gears no longer draw anything, but no errors appear
anywhere.. the window is just empty...
Dave.
