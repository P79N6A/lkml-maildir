But this *ISN'T* a right that the GPLv2 *REQUIRES* be passed on.

The GPLv2 makes no real provision for *DIRECTLY* modifying object code. What 
provisions the GPLv2 has apply to the source code.
And no, the end user *SHOULD* *NOT* be entitled to run whatever kernel they 
like on a TiVO. It was designed with the "install new kernel" functionality 
so that the TiVO corporation could update the kernel running on the hardware 
when security problems came up, when bugs were fixed or even when the new 
version gives better performance.

It *DOES* *NOT* say "All rights that you have". It says "All rights that are 
granted you by this license". If every piece of software released under the 
GPL had *ALL* rights passed on, then *ANYONE* could do the "I'm granting 
company X the right to use this software outside the GPL for $50,000USD." 
instead of just the *creator* of the software.
