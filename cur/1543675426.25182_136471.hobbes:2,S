Nitpicking follows.
Looks like CONFIG_PIIX_TUNING configuration option is partially removed from
the kernel. No references to it can be found in the code at least. However
there still remains references to CONFIG_PIIX_TUNING in Documentation/Configure.help
and arch/*/defconfig* files, which might confuse people unnecessarily. So if
CONFIG_PIIX_TUNING configuration option is not used anymore, I suggest the
trivial 'fix' of removing all references to it.
Particularly, at least these two lines should be removed from under
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_PIIX in Documentation/Configure.help:
  If you say Y here, you should also say Y to "PIIXn Tuning support",
  below.
