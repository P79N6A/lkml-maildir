Hmm, slightly different syndrome: we didn't find a dentry in the cache,
couldn't build a name tree up to the root: but in this case we appeared to find
a parent directory dentry in one of the (numerous, hideously overcomplex) local
caches in the existing nfsfh.c code... but then failed to find our inode's
number in that directory.  Does smell like a rename race or something similar.

Actually knfsd hasn't been changing all that much over the last several 2.2.X
releases.  But a lot of work has been going on behind the scenes by Neil &
Trond.  It's just a question of getting it merged, stabilized & sufficiently
tested.

It's my top priority at this point.  Alan Cox has agreed to accept a patch of
the merged latest "best of breed" once it's been reasonably checked out.
