No, I don't care if the linker merges it or not.  In fact I hope that
maybe the compiler is smart enough to optimize the function for the
sites it's called from in a particular .c file.
But a function defined in a .h file had better be static, so it
shouldn't matter if there are two copies of it in the final linked
image (any more than it matters if there are 100 inlined copies of it).
