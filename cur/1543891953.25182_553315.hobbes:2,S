Thanks for the patch. I am testing with Calgary and will push upstream
through the next batch of Calgary updates when it will be ready. At
the moment it doesn't boot on one of my test machines, I'm looking
into it.
Also, FWIW, we don't use the same pointer for different uses (that
wouldn't have worked, obviously) but I've never been 100% comfortable
with the hack we use and this is obviously the right thing to do.
Cheers,
Muli
