You should find this useful:

The coherency between inode order and file body order is handled for me 
in the existing Ext2 code base.  I haven't really dug into that algorithm but 
it seems to produce servicable results.  Note: Al Viro has taken a look at 
improving that code.  It's an ongoing project that's been discussed on lkml 
and ext2-devel.
As far as coherency between readdir order and inode order goes, I'v just 
left that dangling for the moment.  This doesn't hurt until we get over a 
million files/directory, and then it doesn't hurt an awful lot.  As I 
mentioned earlier, I think the increased table thrashing exhibited over the 
million file mark is more because of shortcomings in icache handling than 
anything else.
In the long run I plan to do some work on inode allocation targets to improve 
the correspondence between readdir order and inode order.
