The raw1394 and video1394 device drivers aren't creating their sysfs
dev nodes. Since these are missing udev can't create /dev/raw1394 and
/dev/video1394/*.  This complicates getting camcorders running on udev
distributions like Fedora Core 3. I searched the archives and one
partial patch for this was proposed but it doesn't look like it got
accepted. Is this being worked on?
Easy work around: MAKEDEV raw1394 video1394, but try telling that to a
newbie. Google search shows many people having this problem. There is
a Redhat bug for this too.
