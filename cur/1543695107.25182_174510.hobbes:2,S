The last time I looked Coda was a horrible mess of a code, closely
impossible to get it compile let alone configure and it seems to have
the same interoperability problems like intermezzo i.e. it didn't work
between i386<->powerpc. I haven't looked at Lustre light or srfs yet but
I certainly welcome any fresh projects in the area of distributed or
replicating filesystems.
