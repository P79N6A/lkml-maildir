the function schedule_timeout in sched.c does the following:
        expire = timeout + j
        init_timer(&timer);
        timer.expires = expire;
        timer.data = (unsigned long) current;
        timer.function = process_timeout;
        add_timer(&timer);
        schedule();
        del_timer(&timer);
        timeout = expire - jiffies;
How can the timer expire, when it is deleted 
immediate after scheduling?
Is there an other way to set a process sleep like the one in 
version 2.0.x 
  current->timeout = jiffies + t;
  current->state = TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE;
  schedule();
  current->timeout = 0;
TIA 
Vasili
