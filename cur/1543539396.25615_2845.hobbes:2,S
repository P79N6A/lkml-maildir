Al and all,
there is a bug in fs/ext2/super.c, which I've reported to Al Viro before
(-test1) with no reaction. Could someone _please_ verify that issue and
convice Al Viro this needs fixing. Thanks.
Problem: parse_options() is called with a pointer to uninitialized
new_mount_opt
in line 660. This may result is arbitrary mount options after a remount
of an ext2 filesystem.
Thise patch is against 2.4.0-test4.
