I am wondering if you are seeing any lock contention for the
host_lock/queue_lock in scsi.
There are some patches not in mainline that I would like to see run
against a multi-disk IO intensive benchmark.
They are currently applied in this bk tree:
bk://linux-scsi.bkbits.net/scsi-locking-2.5
Or, I could send you a patch against 2.5.66.
If you can run with the above and compare to 2.5.66 I would appreciate it
(readprofiles for both cases would still be useful). I would hope to see
at least lower system times.
Thanks.
