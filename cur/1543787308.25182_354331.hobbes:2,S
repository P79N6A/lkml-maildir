Dave,
Was it really necessary to this far and rude?
I heard the snow is falling and there is a fresh shipment of hash headed
out to the slopes, don't be late.
Not sure who to credit the following to:
When TOE's were introduced to Linux, there was a violent rejection of this
hardware because Linux is superior in the NetStack than any other possible
NetStack every created.
The point is there is a known history in Linux to reject things which
steps on peoples' egos.
Have a great ski trip.
Cheers,
Andre
