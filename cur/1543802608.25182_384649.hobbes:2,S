Suspend to *RAM*? That really does not do anything that should kill
the filesystems. Has it ever worked before? When? Any SATA?

No, never seen this before. With suspend to disk and wrong setup,
"kill my filesystem" is easy; but suspend to RAM? Best bet would be
disk driver doing something really stupid.
