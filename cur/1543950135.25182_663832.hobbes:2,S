IMHO no smackfs code should ever execute if smack isn't loaded.
This means catching it from the very fist step where it registers
itself in init_smk_fs instead of doing several if(we're enabled) cases
in the code path.
The solution should be a _general_ solution, _not_ a SMACK one cause 
SELinux sufferes from exactly the same problem.
a.k.a:
LSMs need a scalable way to know if they're enabled that makes 
everyone happy ( especially Linus ;) ).
Regads to all,
