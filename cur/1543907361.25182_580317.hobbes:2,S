The problem is that the suid bit is not removed in all cases
when the file caps need to be removed.  In particular, if
capable(CAP_FSETID), then the suid bit is retained.
I suppose we could change those semantics, but then we'd the code still
doesn't flow quite right for what you suggest - should_remove_suid()
just checks whether the suid bit is set (and the process is !capable(CAP_FSETID),
not whether a change has happened requiring suid change.  That is
already assumed to be the case.
If your main objection is to the LSM_NEED_LOCK argument, we could of
course just grab the mutex around security_inode_killpriv(out->f_path.dentry)
in fs/splice.c:generic_file_splice_write().
And I suppose we can in fact get rid of ATTR_KILL_PRIV.  I had just
put it there to split up the code a bit to make it clearer - which I
do think it does.
Shall I resend without the LSM_NEED_LOCK, or do you still want a more
fundamental change?
thanks,
