So this means that if you want to use pata & sata disks connected to sis 
chipset you cant use sis5513 at all, if I understand this correct?
If that's the case I guess we simply have to blacklist (or stop 
building) the sis5513 and force all sis ide users to pata_sis...
Now, do you consider pata_sis as stable as the sis5513 ?
