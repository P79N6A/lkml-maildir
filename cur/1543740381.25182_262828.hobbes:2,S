I'm just about to start.
I was thinking a reasonable solution would be
to queue work in tty_do_hangup() if ldisc->hangup()
is not defined (== NULL) to switch the ldisc back to N_TTY.
It looks like Alan may have tried something similar
with tty_deferred_ldisc_switch(N_TTY).
If tty_set_ldisc() is called before the work runs
then the work is cancelled. This also cancels
the work if close is called before it runs.
(close sets back to N_TTY anyways)
This restores the original behavior for
devices that have not yet implemented ldisc->hangup()
and should work with the new locking.
