Intel tell me otherwise. The real world also disagrees which makes the

These processors don't report the APIC on the cpuid ? If so then I guess
the fix is something like this
	if( cpuid says there is no local apic && vendor != intel)
Intel stuff appears to always be happy poking in APIC space. I don't know
if this is related to the chip internals on the non APIC capable chips.
