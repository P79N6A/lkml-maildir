Hmm.  Linux isn't quite a "PnP OS".  I agree that in the short
term we should not set the boot flag.  But we should also investigate
what needs to added so that setpnp does not need to be called.
In the normal case the pci subsystem gets this correct, and we need
the logic to get this correct to support hot plug devices.
Do you have any insite into what needs to be done so that the kernel
will automatically configure isa pnp devices?
