Hello,
I wanted compile my own kernel for iPAQ 3630 - 2.4.21 - because of new 
Bluetooth rfcomm.o support and other things, but I can't go nor through 
menuconfig :( My original platform is i386 (Intel Pentium III) - debian woody 
3.0r1
Liboc01:/usr/src/linux# make menuconfig ARCH=arm
rm -f include/asm-arm/arch include/asm-arm/proc
(cd include/asm-arm; ln -sf arch- arch; ln -sf proc- proc)
rm -f include/asm
( cd include ; ln -sf asm-arm asm)
make -C scripts/lxdialog all
make[1]: Entering directory `/usr/src/linux-2.4.20/scripts/lxdialog'
make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/linux-2.4.20/scripts/lxdialog'
/bin/sh scripts/Menuconfig arch/arm/config.in
Using defaults found in arch/arm/defconfig
Preparing scripts: functions, parsingscripts/Menuconfig: line 1:   820 
Segmentation fault      awk "$1"
Awk died with error code 139. Giving up.
make: *** [menuconfig] Error 1
ARCH=ppc for example goes right
problem under 2.4.19, 2.4.20, 2.4.21-pre4 - older kernels I didn't tried
