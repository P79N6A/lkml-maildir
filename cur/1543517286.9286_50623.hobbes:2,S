Hi Everybody!
I updated my old MTRR on WinChip code, so that it also works on the
WinChip 2 & 3. It works fine on my WC2, but to be on the safe side, I
would like some people to give it a try on C6s and/or WC3s, before I
submit it for kernel-inclusion. On my WC2 it improved graphics
performance considerably (after setting up /proc/mtrr).
A patch against 2.2.13 can be found at
http://etpmod.phys.tue.nl/bart/linux/wc2-mtrr-patch-2.2.13.gz
 , 
and one against 2.3.28 at
http://etpmod.phys.tue.nl/bart/linux/wc2-mtrr-patch-2.3.28.gz
 .
Please try it, and tell me if it works!
Thanks,
Bart
