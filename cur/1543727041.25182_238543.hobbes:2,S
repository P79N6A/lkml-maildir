Changing skb->data is not legal.  Please implement this in
such a way that skb->data does not get modified.  By modifying
skb->data you will break things such as packet sniffers and
netfilter, and that's just the tip of the iceberg. :-)
I would suggest merely freeing up this TX skb, and marking the
entry in the b44 software state with some dummy skb pointer
such as (void *) 0x1UL or something like that to indicate
this case.
