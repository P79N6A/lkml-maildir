The example I gave is sufficient for vblank on every video card that was
looked at (which is the main X interest for the Xsync extensions). You
also only have to turn the descriptor from "type, size" into function
pointer to get good performance .. at least I think that will be the
case
	if((op->func(op->offset) & op->mask) != op->value)
		return IRQ_NONE;

For some devices most definitely. The simple descriptors unfortunately
will degenerate into ACPI otherwise.
