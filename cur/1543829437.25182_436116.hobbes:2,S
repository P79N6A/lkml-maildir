this op is only intended to be used only by the lock debugging 
infrastructure. So it should be renamed - but i fail to find a good name 
for it. (it's used quite frequently within the lock debugging code, at 
60+ places) Maybe INTERNAL_WARN_ON()? [that makes it sound special 
enough.] DEBUG_LOCKS_WARN_ON() might work too.
