Dear all,
First, I apologize you for posing this message although I'm not on the list.
I have some questions. I made the following system call for getting tcp 
cwnd size of ongoing connection. However, I am always getting the value 
of "2", which is the initial tcp cwnd size, I think. What I really want 
to do is to trace tcp cwnd size when I download some big file using 
"wget"'s http file downloader. For it, I added a new system call shown 
below and modified the wget source code.
Please cc to me personally in reply. Thanks in advance.
Best Regards,
Yung Yi.
