Oh Larry, are you listening? :)

Noted. Thanks.

They can be, but sometimes it can be useful to put a high-level overview of
what you've done suitable for people who aren't familiar with the code into
the changeset comment, and describe exactly _how_ you did it in per-file
comments.
Which in the case of the patch I sent you yesterday would be something like
'fix zisofs breakage with shared zlib' on the changeset and 'set return 
value to trv not f in NEEDBYTE' in the lib/zlib_inflate/inflate.c log.
In this case, the latter can obviously be deduced from the diffs because
it's a one-liner, so perhaps it's a bad example -- but you don't always
actually want to have to refer to the diffs.
