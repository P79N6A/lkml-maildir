Yes, based on vfs.txt I figured unionfs should return
AOP_WRITEPAGE_ACTIVATE.  But, now that unionfs has ->writepages which won't
even call the lower writepage if BDI_CAP_NO_WRITEBACK is on, then perhaps I
no longer need unionfs_writepage to bother checking for
AOP_WRITEPAGE_ACTIVATE, or even return it up?
But, a future file system _could_ return AOP_WRITEPAGE_ACTIVATE w/o setting
BDI_CAP_NO_WRITEBACK, right?  In that case, unionfs will still need to
handle AOP_WRITEPAGE_ACTIVATE in ->writepage, right?
