hi all,
this is the first time i tried to use a 2.5.x kernel. i compiled it
successfully but at boot time it stops at "ok booting kernel"
this is gentoo 1.2, gcc-2.95.3, 2.5.64 vanilla
amd athlon 800, 512mb, asus a7v with udma/100 ibm-disk (boot device),
dvd-rom / cd-burner at udma/66
what shall i do? do you need additional information?
please cc me.
bye,
daniel
