Hi,
I want to understand this new address_space stuff, so my question is this: 
Imagine I want to invalidate all the pages (data and metadata)
corresponding to a given inode, so next io on this inode will guarantee to
call the get_block() fs-specific method. I guess I need to go through the
'pages' list of inode->i_mapping and inode->i_data under the cover of
i_shared_lock and 'invalidate' each page. But how? Any clues?
Regards,
