Please note I didn't say .20 *and all future versions*. I asked because it 
just seems to me that while kernel 2.4 is definitely improving, it is being 
pulled hard in 2 directions -- towards stability and towards 2.5.
I was hoping that, if we had a release that was focused on stability, the 
current code base might get a longer testing phase, resulting in a better 
code base overall.
I have been involved in professional software engineering for many years -- 
I know how things go and how basic structure affects things. However, I 
also know (from my own experience) that bug fixing is not nearly as 
exciting as developing some new feature, or getting a chunk of code "just 
right", when it worked ok to begin with.  My commercial experience is that, 
at the end of a project, introducing significant changes of any type is 
something you do rarely and with great care; even the best engineer 
sometimes misses an important side-issue and messes up.
I guess I might be digging a hole here, but I'm trying hard to make Linux 
better for us all.
