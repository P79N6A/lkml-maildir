A cd-burner is hardly a replacement for a 35gb native tape format...
I'd probably run a cleaning tape through the drive a couple times to
start, try a fresh tape in the drive, isolate it on it's own scsi
interface if there are other devices connected on the same bus, and have
the drive evaluated and serviced by hp in roughly that order...
