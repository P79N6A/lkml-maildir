I don't understand this dependency. The cmd_line_ptr is a 
null terminated string which set by the boot loader.
The kernel reads this string until the null or 
COMMAND_LINE_MAX_SIZE.
If the user specified too large buffer or too small buffer 
it won't reflect the boot loader since it sets the maximum 
sizeof the buffer, and the kernel truncates it.

I've looked at the sources of lilo and grub, both truncate 
the command line to 256 into the old protocol and set the 
cmd_line_ptr to point to the same place.
This change will no affect current implementation of the 
bootloader, but will allow them to change the code to set 
the cmd_line_ptr to the full command line.
I think that the maximum size should be set to 1024, but 
since the kernel allocates a static buffer, users may wish 
to optimize it. So I think that a configuration option is 
the right place.
