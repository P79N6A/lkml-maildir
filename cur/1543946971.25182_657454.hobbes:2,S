<test 1> have no swap device with 200 tasks by hackbench.
But <test 2> have swap device(32M) with 240 tasks by hackbench.
If <test2> have no swap device without your patch, <test2> is killed by OOM.
<test 1> - NO SWAP
Running with 5*40 (== 200) tasks.
...
<test 2> - SWAP
Running with 6*40 (== 240) tasks.

Normally, embedded linux have only one zone(DMA).
If your patch isn't applied, several processes can reclaim memory in parallel.
then, DMA zone's pages_scanned is suddenly increased largely. Because
embedded linux have no swap device,  kernel can't stop to scan lru
list until meeting page cache page. so if zone->pages_scanned is
greater six time than lru list pages, kernel make the zone with
unreclaimable state, As a result, OOM will kill it, too.
