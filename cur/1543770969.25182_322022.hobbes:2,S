Bill, I think you're chasing everyone off this thread ;-)

Karim,
I would assume that the distros would ship without PREEMPT enabled
because it was (and probably still is) considered unstable.  The distros
would prefer to have less responsive machines (not saying PREEMPT helps
the normal desktop user) than risking a machine crash.  That would be
much more noticeable to the user!
The PREEMPT is already there, and if you were to add PREEMPT_RT then I
don't think many of the developers would notice.  Now if someone found a
problem some where with PREEMPT_RT and complained to the maintainer, the
maintainer should (rightfully) tell them to complain to the RT
maintainers (Ingo and others, I'll help when I can).  But the way Ingo's
patch works now, is to not change the way the kernel looks to the
devices.  The device driver is still written the same and when a problem
occurs, that something doesn't work right with -RT, one of us fixes it,
and then submits it to the maintainer of the code.  So the only extra
work a maintainer would have is dealing with those maintaining RT.
