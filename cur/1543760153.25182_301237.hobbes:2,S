I also have an X31 and I noticed that the e1000 has Wake-On-Lan enabled
by default and the S3 code doesn't disable that (kind of defeats the
purpose :)
Disabling that will make the e1000 driver power down the chip during S3.
ethtool -s ethX wol d
I don't know if you have the e1000 or e100 in your machine, but I think
the e100 driver does the same.
I've had mine suspended for 2-3 days at most, actually havn't left it
alone for longer than that in S3 so I'm not really sure how much power
it consumes, but I'd say it's 1-2 percent of the total capacity per
hour, so somewhere below 1000mW.
I also use the standard radeontool to disable the backlight, I'll test
the version Matthew pointed out some day.
