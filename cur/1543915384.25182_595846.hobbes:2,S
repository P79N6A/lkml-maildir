Well, what I was referring to here, of course, was the initramfs
integrated in the kernel image, so it all comes out of the kernel build
tree and produces a single bootable image.  The fact that part of it
contains userspace code is in that way invisible.
That was kind of the point here, and the only reason for pushing klibc
into the kernel build tree at all.  Under the "distros use external
initrd anyway" school of thought, whatever libc used for that can be
external anyway.
