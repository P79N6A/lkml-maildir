Yes, I mentioned this before. The slowdown is unavoidable because the
contents of the scrollback is read from the VGA RAM.  It can be speeded
up but it will require an overhaul of vgacon to use buffers in system
RAM for the entire screen contents, visible and not visible.
Hard scrollback is still the default for vgacon, and soft scrollback
has to be selected during kernel config.

Of course.
