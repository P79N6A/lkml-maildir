Almost.  E2fsck support is fully there.  With e2fsprogs 1.28, you
still need to manually set up the dir_index feature flag to convert a
filesystme to use the directory indexing feature:
debugfs -w -R "features dir_index" /dev/hdXX
debugfs -w -R "ssv def_hash_version tea" /dev/hdXX
debugfs -w -R "ssv hash_seed random" /dev/hdXX
In the 1.29 release, mke2fs will create filesystems with the directory
indexing flag set by default, and tune2fs -O dir_index will do set up
the directory indexing flag and the default hash version
automatically.
There is also a bug in e2fsprogs 1.28 so that the -D option to e2fsck
(which optimizes all directories) has a 1 in 512 chance of corrupting
a directory, due to a fenceport error that escaped my testing.  This
will be fixed in 1.29, which should be released very shortly.
Folks who want to play with the latest e2fsprogs get grab it here:
