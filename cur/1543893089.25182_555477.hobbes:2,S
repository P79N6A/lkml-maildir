Because if you give guarantees on something, ppl start using such 
guarantee in the wrong way. Kyle's email summarizes it.
This should really be treated as an opaque handle, with no assumption on 
its value. And if you start handing over values that are not predictable, 
the userspace is *forced* to not use any assumption on its values. I never 
made any assumption on values returned by APIs returning "handles", and I 
never had any problem (or even care) about how those values were 
distributed in the N bit space.
