Subject: ACPI without PCI doesn't compile in 2.6.0-test5-bk3

Hello!
I'm trying to compile Linux 2.6.0-test5-bk3 for my 486 laptop.  The config
file is here:
http://www.red-bean.com/~proski/i486/dotconfig
I'm getting this error:
drivers/built-in.o(.init.text+0x913): In function `acpi_bus_init':
: undefined reference to `eisa_set_level_irq'
make: *** [.tmp_vmlinux1] Error 1
Close examination shows that acpi_bus_init() from drivers/acpi/bus.c calls
eisa_set_level_irq() if CONFIG_X86 is defined.  On the other hand,
eisa_set_level_irq() is defined in arch/i386/pci/irq.c and requires
CONFIG_PCI is addition to CONFIG_X86.
It's trivial to remove eisa_set_level_irq() call is CONFIG_PCI is not
defined, but I don't know if it's right.  I actually don't have APCI on
that laptop (I enabled it by mistake), so I cannot test if it works.
