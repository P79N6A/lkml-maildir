I think this is really going way too far.  I mean, the datum which
we take away from the above result is that 2.5.38 sucks. No more
accuracy is required.
Yes, if the differences are small then a few extra runs may be needed
to drill down into the finer margins.  The tester should be able to
judge that during the test.  You get a feel for these things.
I believe that your time would be better spent developing and incorporating
more tests (wider coverage) than worrying about super-high accuracy.
(And if there's more than a 1% variation between same kernel, compiled
with different compilers then the test is bust.  Kernel CPU time is
dominated by cache misses and runtime is dominated by IO wait.
Quality of code generation is of tiny significance)
