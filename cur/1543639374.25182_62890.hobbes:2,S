Gah.  Good point.  Ok, I've added locking to the cred structure to handle
this.  Here's my new patch with those changes made:
http://www.ibm.com/linux/ltc/patches/misc/cred-2.5.30-5.diff.gz
I've gone through all the code again, and don't see any other places where
locking is really necessary.  Feel free to point them out to me if you see
any.
