Unfortunately the test code I wrote years ago is only for Open Watcom and 
uses inline assembler. It hasn't been used for some time and I am not 
sure if it works properly or not (I don't think it does right now). Plus 
we recently found out that it doesn't test everything, just the 
implementation of prim_ops.c.
The only real way to test the emulator is to use it to emulate some code. 
We don't have any code we use on a regular basis to test it, but perhaps 
we should think about building a test suite for it. Usually we test it on 
Video BIOS ROM's, but that is painful because you have to switch video 
cards all the time.
XFree86 and X.org do use the same code so it could be tested there, but 
once again it is only used for Video BIOS ROM stuff.
