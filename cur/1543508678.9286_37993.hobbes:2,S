Subject: problem with sio_pci_fixup(noname_map_irq, 0x0b0a0f0d) under alpha

On my noname alpha I run into trouble with 2.2.0-pre8 and later,
2.2.0-pre7 was the last oen to work for me.
The problem is that when I boot up the scsi card starts to timeout and
some debugging showed that it newer got anoy answers to any of the
commands.
I did compare and reaply all fixes between 2.2.0-pre7 and 2.2.0 and manage
to nail it down to a small patch in alpha/kernel/sys_sio.c to fix it even
under 2.2.12. In the noname_pci_fixup function the sio_pci_fixup call
changed from ...0d to ...0e and after revers that change it worked fine
again. Why was that changed? what does it do?
my relevant hw is:
Alpha AXP33PCI noname
onboard ncr53x810 scsi with irq11
separate qlogic 1020 scsi pci card with irq 14
