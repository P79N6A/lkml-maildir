No, Alan. *You* don't think this is a good idea. Not everyone agrees
with you. My patch is safe: it makes use of the safe major allocation
function so that >128 SD's can be used. You seem to be against this
patch because it would mean that you can't just keep handing out major
numbers, ignoring Linus' "no new majors" decree.
