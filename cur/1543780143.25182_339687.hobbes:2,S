This patch lets this header stand alone, since I can never remember
which other headers to include, or in which order.
The three #include lines define the types: kobject, list_head and dev_t,
which are used in the cdev structure.
The forward declaration of struct inode is to quiet the following
compiler warning when including only cdev.h in my file:
include/linux/cdev.h:30: warning: its scope is only this definition or
declaration, which is probably not what you want
I'm not sure, but I think it's saying that I'm declaring a new struct,
which will not be the same as the real struct inode if it is #included
later, because of the scope rules.
(oh yeah, this is my first patch to the list; did I get the format
right?)
