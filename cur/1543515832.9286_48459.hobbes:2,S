Btw, last time I played with serial ports getting data at 115.2k and
dropping characters, the effect was caused by the console driver or xterm
+ minicom combination.  Using cat on /dev/ttyS1 resulted in a steady and
uninterrupted stream of data.  Which leads me to wonder: does X disable
interrupts?
