My new hackbench-testcase also killed 2.6.24-rc2-mm1, so I really
noticed to late.

I tried the following three patches:
switching the barrier() for a smp_mb() in 2.6.25-rc2-mm1:
-> crashed
reverting the FASTPATH-patch in 2.6.25-rc2:
-> worked
only removed FAST_CMPXCHG_LOCAL from arch/x86/Kconfig
-> worked
So all of these tests seem to confirm, that the bug is in the new SLUB fastpath.
