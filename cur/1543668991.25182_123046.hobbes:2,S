Bah, offsets are slightly wrong, but the point is obviously the same
0-150 -> 151-200 -> 201-300 -> 301-400 -> 401-500 -> 501-999
 A          A          A          A          A          A
 B          B
            C          C          C 
                                  D          D          
                                  E          E
