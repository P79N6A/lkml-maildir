When I try to compile the kernel source I get the following error.
/usr/src/linux/include/asm/string.h: 443 (and 594):warning: Control
reaches end of non-void function
I have an idea of what this means, but have no clue as to what all I need
to do to fix this.  I don't know jack about assembly code.
I get so many of these errors that is isn't funny.  I guess as far a
popularity goes `string.h` is a contest winner.  Seems like everything
includes this file?.>?<:L?
If there is documentation that solves this specific problem can someone
point me in the right direction.
System:
Kernel Version 2.0.34
AMD K-6 2 300 3D
IDE HD
MEM 32megs
thanks
