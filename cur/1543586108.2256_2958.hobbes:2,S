I've figured that out, but menuconfig is ambiguous and it should be 
corrected. It implies that you need to select a single processor type (ie 
Pentium, PIII, etc) which is not correct.
I also find it interesting that the default at kernel.org wont boot on a 
Pentium...generic should be the default.
thanks.
