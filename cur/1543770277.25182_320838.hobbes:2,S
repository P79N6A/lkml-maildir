For this, there is a nice 
	atomic_dec_and_lock()
function that is the same as "atomic_dec_and_test()", except it grabs the 
lock if the count decrements to zero.
I'm surprised people haven't picked up on it - it's been around for a
while, the VFS layer uses it for some quite fundamental data structures
(inode and dcache refcounts), and it's even documented in "atomic_ops.txt"
And it's _designed_ for refcountign things like this.
Basic rule of kernel programming: if a globally visible object does not 
have a refcount, IT IS A BUG.
