Get over it!  If you haven't noticed, CryptoAPI is merged already.  The only 
bloat ACLs cause is the size of the source tarball.  If your connection is 
slow or you are out of diskspace, too bad!  I'm sure I'm not the only one 
who is tired of hearing people whine about "bloat" wrt the sources and 
demanding that features they don't use be ignored.  No one (non-core) 
feature will be useful to everyone, that is a given fact.  The point is 
that while you see no use for it, there are many others out there who do.  
ACLs are something which have existed in the Solaris/BSD world for a long 
time now, and people who have admin these boxen find ACLs to be quite 
useful.
Cheers,
Nicholas
