SGI has machines bigger than 128 (if memory serves, 1024??) that I thought
had booted Linux. The Sequent/IBM NUMA-Q archictecture now supports Linux 
and would go to 64 procs if we removed a few bitmap limitations from the kernel 
that have been patched out before (well, actually 60 is easy, 64 would require
some more apic modifications). 
Anyway, bigger than 8 way is no pipedream. I'll admit few people could afford
such machines, but they do exist.
Martin.
