Oh wow.  I can only assume that this code leg hasn't been exercised at all.
(I'm a bit surprised that the compiler doesn't warn and demand another set
of parentheses, actually.  I guess they decided not to do that for some
reason).
I'll tag this for a 2.6.16 backport, but I'm worried that what we have here
is a pretty significant codepath which just hasn't been executed.
