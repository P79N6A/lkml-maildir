Nothing which sleeps for very long - mainly serial drivers which queue
a call to tty_hangup(), which immediately queues _another_ tq_scheduler
call to do_tty_hangup (Why?  Heaven knows).

tq_scheduler is a bug.  You can't sleep, you can't call copy_*_user,
you can't call kmalloc non-atomically.  But we do do these things.
Really the only reason for using tq_scheduler is so you can acquire
the tasklist_lock or the files_lock. schedule_task() is fine for that.
tq_scheduler must die.
