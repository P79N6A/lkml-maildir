I just did now per your request. To make things more relevant I
created a file structure from the 2.4.19 kernel sources and repeated it
recursively into the deepest dir level (10) 4 times ending up with
7280 directories with 40 levels of directories depth and 1 GB
data set size. I run both tar and untar operations on the tree
for ext3, reiserfs, jfs and DualFS. I remounted the FS before
each test. I end up with 7280 directories 40 levels depth and
1 GB data. Both tar file and directory tree were on the FS under
test.
Here are the results - elapse time in sec:
		tar	untar
ext3:		144	143
reiserfs:	100	100
JFS:		196	140
DualFS:		63	54
Hope this helps.
