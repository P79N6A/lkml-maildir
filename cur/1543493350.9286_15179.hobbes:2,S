Right. But the information given in the original post did not specify what
additional devices were in the system. It is easy to run out with a PC.

True. My concern was that he wanted to use the on-board interfaces in
addition to the PCI cards. I thought at the time that there might possibly
be a problem with some buggy motherboard controllers not being able to
share an IRQ. This, coupled with the fact that other devices might have
eaten up the rest of them made me think that a consideration might be the
number of IRQ's available. I have sinse learned that this may not be as
much of a concern but I am not convinced that it can be simply dismissed
in all cases.
