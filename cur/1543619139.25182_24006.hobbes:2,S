I'd agree, except I doubt there is every much contention on the _same_
file.
The reason llseek() ends up being so clear on the profiles is that it's a
very common system call under certain loads _and_ it uses a shared lock
for everything.
Also note the correctness issue (ie serialization on i_size), although
that is only an issue for SEEK_END (and maybe the lock should only be
gotten for that case. I'd love to hear what Al thinks..
