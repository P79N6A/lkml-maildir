No. The race being discussed is:
proc code:                             resetting code:
=============================================================================
task_lock(tsk);
files = tsk->files;
                                       old = tsk->files;
                                       tsk->files = files;
                                       put_files_struct(old); /* dec to 0 */
                                            `- kmem_cache_free(files);
get_files_struct(file); /* already free */
task_unlock(tsk);
So having smp_mb() before put_files_struct() does not fix the problem.
