Both of these are when list-walking the revoke list.  That's purely an
in-memory data structure, it shouldn't be affected by anything on disk. 
You could try a forced fsck just to be sure, but it doesn't sound like
there's a corruption on disk here.  (There *is* a variant of the revoke
list that is read from disk, but that's only used during log replay,
which isn't active in your oops traces.)

Sounds to me like you're getting corruption in a repeatable address
somewhere at boot time that just happens to be hitting the revoke list
early on.
I saw something like this once before, except it was on a buffer_head
list.  Debugging, I was able to identify that the *previous* entry of
the list was always exactly at the 16MB mark in memory, and the list
pointers there were getting corrupted.  Turned out to be a bad BIOS that
was trapping a PCI bus operation, setting up a pte for some internal
workspace, restoring it on exit back to the OS but forgetting to flush
the tlb.  Adding a tlb flush after various PCI ops fixed it completely. 
Similar footprint to yours: a crash shortly after boot in a specific
data structure but with pretty random VAs, and at random points in the
bh walking code.
The revoke code hasn't changed in *ages*, and I've never seen a report
of that list getting corrupted before.  I suspect the fs is just an
innocent victim here.
Cheers,
 Stephen
