This causes mysterious hangs when starting init.
Distro is RH FC1, running SysVinit-2.85-5.
dmesg, sysrq-T and .config are at
http://www.zip.com.au/~akpm/linux/patches/stuff/log-vmm
 - nothing leaps
out.
This is the second time recently when a patch has caused this machine to
oddly hang in init.  It's possible that there's a bug of some form in that
version of init that we'll need to know about and take care of in some
fashion.
(I verified the hang with just -linus+this, so it's not related to any
other -mm things).
