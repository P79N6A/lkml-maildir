If it would be protected by the big kernel lock it would have no raced in
first place. I think the reason the bh_mask setting it's _not_ racing at
all is a luck timing issue. 
The disable/enable_bh() SMP race in the console code if not atomic
operation are used because one CPU is running the console_bh handler (from
the keyboard irq handler)  and the other CPU is in the write(2) path from
a proggy.
