In my case it is completely repeatable. 
Boot, start jackd, stop jackd -> problem appears. 
This does not happen on all computers so it would seem to me it is
related to the sound drivers. I'll try to see if there is a correlation
with the sound card being used. 
Is there anything else I could do to try to help resolve this?
