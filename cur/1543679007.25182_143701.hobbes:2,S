Complicated indeed, but why do that?
A process sleeping on a pipe will wake up in the kernel's
pipe reading code, won't it?  No need for guessing where
it was sleeping.  Code for transferring interactivity
bonus could go right there.

I must admit I don't know the details of the scheduler.  Still, Linus
tried a form of redistribution (the backboost thing).  It helped in some 
cases.
It seems to me that it got revoked because it did the wrong
thing at times, leading to starvation issus that didn't exist before.
It didn't go because it was overly complex or slow?
