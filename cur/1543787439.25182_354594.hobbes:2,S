Actually, it seems better. It seems to be buggered by default, but it used 
to be that you had to actually recompile pine to make it behave. Now you 
can just disable "strip-whitespace-before-send" and _enable_ 
"quell-flowed-text" and those together seem to do the trick. No extra 
patches or recompiles necessary.
So there's progress. 
Of course, pico is still pico. Which I find a bit sad: my editor of choise 
is still an improved version of uemacs, and pico actually comes from the 
same uemacs history, but has different key-bindings for just enough keys 
to be slightly confusing.
Still, that shared history means that I find pico a lot more to my taste 
than just about any other emailer editor out there. It may have a few 
differences, but it has more things in common..
