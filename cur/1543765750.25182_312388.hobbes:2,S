If both NIC and disk is clever enough, they can both use DMA:
NIC ==dma==> RAM ==dma==> DISK
without CPU needing to ever touch the bulk of data.

Yes. This is why TCP offload is a buzzword mostly.
Anybody with real experience on this?

Most probably marketspeak.

If you put firewall machine in front of your 10GigE server, you
are killing its performance.

Are specs available?
