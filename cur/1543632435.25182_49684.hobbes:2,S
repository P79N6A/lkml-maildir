I have looked at the above factoring, which was only a file factoring,
neither bug-fix factoring, nor feature factoring.
IMHO this is not the way kbuild-2.5 ever get included in the kernel.

Again wrong approah. Extend kbuild-2.4 with the features, tweak them until
they actually meet the requirements and then on to the next step.
Obviously the dependency step is huge, but the point is that there is
steps before and after this.
