The 'badness in pci_find_subsys' may not be related to your hang. 
The NVidia msgs are basically caused by the fact that pci_find_slot() is
getting called in an interrupt, so we trigger the WARN_ON in pci_find_subsys().
The worry here is that we may be walking the PCI list on the interrupt side
while something else is hotplugging a new device into existence, causing it to
walk off the end of a inconsistent list.  Unless you actually crapped out right
at 13:08:23, it's probably unrelated.
(I was getting the same NVidia traceback on a regular basis (3-4 at every start
of the X server, and 1 at X server shutdown) under 2.5.72-mm3, they stopped
when I went to 2.5.73-mm1.  If you're still seeing them in 2.6.0-test1, I would
suspect something different in the -mm series is fixing them for me - first place
to look is what got added between 72-mm3 and 73-mm1.
