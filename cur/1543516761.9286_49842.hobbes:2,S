But you see - the "every 11 minutes" behaviour is a loss for everybody.
It destroys good information.
You are happy, but with hwclock or some variation you would be in sync
faster and with greater accuracy.
As the hwclock manpage says:
       If your system runs with 11  minute  mode  on,  don't  use
       hwclock --adjust or hwclock --hctosys.  You'll just make a
       mess.
The present situation is that we have the system call adjtimex
with a strange peculiar undocumented side effect that nobody wants
namely that not only the system time is adjusted, but that the
kernel comes into a mode where it periodically overwrites RTC
with system clock.
This is not a clean design. It might be reasonable to have a system call
or ioctl "write system clock into RTC now". (Not that anybody who
cares about precise timekeeping would ever use it.) But today we
have this terrible combination where setting the system clock from
an outside source automatically leads to fumbling the RTC, making the
information accumulated in /etc/adjtime worthless.
There is only one right behaviour regarding the RTC: leave it alone
and write down how much it differed from real time at a given point
in time, and what the daily drift is. Then at boot time you read RTC,
calculate the actual time and set system time from that.
