I'll test it tomorrow. Testing disables my network, and making sure the 
problem exists without the patch kills my disk controller, so I need to 
sit at the computer for a while. I assume that I've got the only known 
device that demonstrates the need for this?
Off topic: would it be wise as a general rule to somehow shut down devices 
whose interrupts get disabled by the "nobody cared!" code? Or maybe call 
their interrupt handlers periodically to keep them alive?
