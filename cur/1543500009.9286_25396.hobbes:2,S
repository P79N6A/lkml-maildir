Surely the sensible way of doing this is to define an ioctl2() system
call which is given a length.  I imagine we would then add an ioctl2()
method to struct file_operations, and fall back to ioctl() (trimming
off the length word) for compatibility.
I wonder if we can do this in a clever enough way to renumber all the
old definitions of ioctl numbers.
(from:
#define LOOP_SET_FD     0x4C00
to:
#define VIDIOCGCAP              _IOR('v',1,struct video_capability)
)
The alternative would be to drop ioctl altogether and replace it with a
different interface.  plan9 uses ctl files -- you write strings to them
to perform commands.  But I'm not sure people are willing to make that
kind of radical change (certainly not within the 2.3 timeframe).
