Kernel 2.6.11, though I can't check others due to bandwidth 
restrictions.  2.6.11.10 through 2.6.12-rc6 all have the same issue.

This problem only occurs on localhost.  I don't think it is mere luck, 
these are too frequent and strange for this.

I apologise for this, included this time is an attatchment in the hope 
you are able to reproduce the strange results I and others have been 
able to.  Try testing multiple times, I find that 18 out of 20 runs 
produces the same type of results.
