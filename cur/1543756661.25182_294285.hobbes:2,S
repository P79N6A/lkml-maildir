Well, it used to work upstream fine for some time now... The large patch
isn't risky imho, at least in the latest version I sent you. The bulk of
the changes are just code to re-initialize new chip that isn't executed
at all on earlier models. The main radeonfb code changes very little. I
haven't had a failure report with the latest patch yet.

Ahem ... not that badly broken on releases, I've been careful enough
that at least, powerbook sleep worked fine for some time now.

Those 2 first at least yes

And either the above, or I can do a minimal patch on radeonfb just
restoring sleep on earlier models (adding the pmac_feature call to
notify the arch code that we can wakeup the chip) if you don't want to
merge the bigger update.
