This is nothing but word games.
As clone() demonstrates, there are lots of things that you can share  
between tasks; when you actually differentiate between "processes" and  
"threads", the usual definition is that the former don't share VM, whereas  
the latter do.
Can you point me to the text that makes Pike's original point? Google  
certainly wasn't able to help me; I mainly found a recent article about OS  
research that, IMHO, made enough mistakes to be a bad introdouction to  
Pike. (Unless of course the original text is similar.)
