From the description, this is exactly what the root-domains were created
to solve.
Vaidyanathan,  just declare your object in "struct root_domain" and
initialize it in init_rootdomain() in kernel/sched.c, and then access it
via rq->rd to take advantage of this infrastructure.  It will
automatically follow any partitioning that happens to be configured.
