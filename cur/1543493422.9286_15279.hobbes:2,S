A dumb question....
  PID TTY STAT TIME COMMAND
    2  ?  SW   0:30 (kflushd)
    3  ?  SW   0:00 (kpiod)
    4  ?  SW   0:19 (kswapd)
   13  ?  S    0:05 update 
  
what are these processes and what do they do ?
kpiod looks new... I didn't remember it in 2.1 kernels
Please don't tell me to read the source code, I wouldn't have asked if
I could understand it :-)
