Patch 5/5 seems to have a horrid deactivation scheme.

Well, the whole over the limit handler is quite painfull, having taken a
second reading it isn't all that complex after all, just odd.
You just start invalidating whole files for file backed pages. Granted,
this will get you below the threshold. but you might just have destroyed
your working set.
Pretty much the same for you anonymous memory handler, you scan through
the pages in linear fashion and demote the first that you encounter.
Both things pretty thoroughly destroy the existing kernel reclaim.
