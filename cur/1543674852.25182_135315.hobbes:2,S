Your API is compatible with *BSD but I'm wondering whether something 
slightly different might make error handling for callers easier:
Currently strlcpy returns the total length of the string it tried to 
create, whether it was too long or not. This means a check whether the 
complete string was copied is always something like
  if (strlcpy(dest, src, sizeof(dest)) >= sizeof(dest))
      goto toolong;
If strlcpy would return 0 for successful copies this would simplify to
  if (!strlcpy(dest, src, sizeof(dest)))
      goto toolong;
A patch is below.
I've tested only the compilation, any comments are welcome.
Another possible change to the semantics might be to copy/cat only if
dest is big enough to make error handling especially in the case of
strlcat easier (without additional information it's currently impossible
to get the original contents of dest if only parts of src were copied).
