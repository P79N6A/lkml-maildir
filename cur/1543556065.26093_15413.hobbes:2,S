I'll try, but it is not easily reproducible. Fortunately.
BTW, during night, it came to me that maybe I was biased with original
diagnostics (thing written twice), as there was (~3 weeks ago) unpacked
XF4.0.1-0phase?v27 on the same disk. 
As font data did not change between these two versions, it is possible 
that one 27 blocks chunk (*.c files) was lost (or written somewhere where 
I did not found it yet), instead of another one (fonts) duplicated.
                                                Thanks,
