It seems to me, that to be consistent with the argument you seem to be
presenting concerning binary data in GPLd code, that you also need to be
demanding the "source" hardware design for binary register values.
Why not consider the binary firmware in the same category as binary
register programming information?  You poke these magic bytes into these
memory locations and it works.
Where do you draw the lines between "write this byte to set the input
gate here and the output gate to there" and "write this byte sequence to
send the input byte through this loop, into this buffer, add it to the
last byte entered, and output it over there"?
