The chip driver will detect a 32MiB chip from the CFI probe.  The map
size isn't really used by the chip driver, it's just needed to ensure
that the area is accessible.  What you could try doing is adding a
cfi_fixup function that changes the CFI data read in to remove the
last 64KiB of the chip...  not sure if that will work though.

Usually this isn't something you want to do especially with flash.  If
a cache line is flushed back to the chip it's probably not going to
work.  The cacheable mappings work for RAM based devices though.
