I'm happy to be able to say that this bit of oddness is gone, I've now 
rebooted back and forth several times to test3 without that problem.  
Kudzu however still insists on finding a 'generic 3 button mouse' at 
each 2.6 boot, and even though I tell it to do nothing, that same 
generic mnouse is found and removed when booting back to 2.4.22-rc2, 
and I then have to reselect the Logitek Mouseman wheel mouse (USB) 
again.
Is this something in my .config?  Or does kudzu need help for 2.6?
