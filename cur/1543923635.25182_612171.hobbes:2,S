I think I'm with jgarzik on this, lets not do this until its clear where
the generalized instrumentation goes to.
That is, i386/x86_64 -> x86 was part of a full integration plan, one
that was immediately followed up by a series of integration patches.
With this, I see no such plan. Please draft this generic instrumentation
you talk about, if after that we all like it, we can go moving files
together with the immediate purpose of integrating them.
