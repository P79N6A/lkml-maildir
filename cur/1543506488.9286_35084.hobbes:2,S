What matters is whether Linux runs on those machines.  I think of the
byte/word issue much the same way I think of "unsigned long" in Linux; it's
used interchangeably with "void *" because it makes sense for all supported
(and likely supported) architectures.  Of course, using the number itself
in the name doesn't hurt: write64, read16, etc.  I'd take credit for the
suggestion if it hadn't already been posted. ;-)
