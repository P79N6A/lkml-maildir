The standard kernel isn't really specialized in SCSI jukebox stuff, your
mileage may vary, maybe people can give you success and failure reports on
various configurations.
There is a non-mainstream patch we have used for a while, it worked okay.
We just couldn't fit stuff on our jukebox anymore so we are now running
mirrors.
