There's the drivers calling cdev_add() directly as well - another
40ish.  Still not a huge list, I guess.

This is all certainly doable, but it leaves me with one concern: there
will be no signal to external module maintainers that the change needs
to be made.  So, beyond doubt, quite a few of them will just continue to
be shipped unfixed - and they will still run.  If any of them actually
*need* the BKL, something awful may happen to somebody someday.
