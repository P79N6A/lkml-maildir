How one is supposed to handle the reference count of a task_struct from a 
kernel module?
get_task_struct() and put_task_struct() do not work, because the latter can't 
be used from a module, since it calls __put_task_struct(), which is not 
EXPORT_SYMBOL()'d.
I'm running 2.6.8.1.
Thanks in advance for your time,
