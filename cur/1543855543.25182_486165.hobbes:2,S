I don't think so. 
defconfig is just there to get some working system. You should really
pay attention to the config options you care about, and select the value
YOU want. Neither defconfig nor the "default value" matter in that.
Of course especially the "default value" should be a sane one, but it is
in this case.. your system boots and works fine.
defconfig also tends to be the config used by the arch maintainer, eg
the one he uses for his system. He might very well have different
preferences than you have...
