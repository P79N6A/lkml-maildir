Already done, and yes, reasons were precisely what you've mentioned.

Also handled - we expand the buffer if needed.

Bingo.  Except that I do separate allocation of buffer.

Exactly, except that there's no reason to limit it to procfs.

It's _very_ close to what I've done.

Right.  We should never leave more than one entry in buffer - we have every
right to try and fill several, as long as we know that all but the last one
will be immediately eaten.
Check the previous mail I've sent - it contains pretty straightforward
pseudocode for seq_read().  Aside of the fact that seq_read() simply
doesn't bother with sub-record resolution, it's pretty close to your
function.
BTW, I've missed check for pread() - good thing that you've mentioned
it in your variant...
