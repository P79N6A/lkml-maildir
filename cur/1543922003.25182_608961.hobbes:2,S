Probably someone just needs to be more vocal and active in pushing it
to the USB subsystem maintainer(s).  I've even had trouble getting
even simple bug fixes integrated recently, so perhaps it will take a
few retransmits and some patience to get it included.
Anyways, thanks for bringing it to our attention.
Greg, can you at least devote a few minutes to going over that USB MSI
patch, giving it any obvious things it needs (perhaps some
pci_msi_enable() return value checks, for example, but may not be
needed at all in this case) and then stash it somewhere so it doesn't
get lost in the void?
Thanks.
