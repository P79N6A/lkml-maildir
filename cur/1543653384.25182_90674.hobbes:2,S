Just IMHO: I would prefer a different behaviour:
	int epoll_ctl(int epfd, int fd, int events)
which registers interest for "events" on "fd" and retuns previous
registered events for that fd (implies that the fd is removed when
"events" is 0) or -1 for error.
If you don't like it, at least an EP_CTL_GET should be added though.
Btw, what errno for an invalid fd (not epfd)?

Fine.  I guess, only POLLIN/readable is generated.

The previous "yes" already answers this ;-)  What I meant, ie three
fd-sets - low, normal, high priority fds - and a fourth set consisting
of the three epfds for these sets.

Hehe, sure.  But could become tricky: someone may build a circular chain
of epoll-fd-sets.

And what happens then?  Will the set refers to the fds from the sender
process or of fds of the receiving process (which may not even have
all those fds open)?
Another btw, what happens on close of an fd?  Will it get removed from all
epoll-fd-sets automatically?

... and then after each epoll_wait call, I assume?

Huh, sorry.  I meant read/write/poll style of operations.
Anyway, thanks for the information.  I hope they will find their way
into the man-pages ;-)   (Ok, they may become more like the posix docs
but IMHO new interfaces should be well documented.)
Ciao, ET.
