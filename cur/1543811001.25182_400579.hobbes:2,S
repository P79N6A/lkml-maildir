In do_IRQ() there's a call to exit_idle(), which calls __exit_idle(), 
which runs the idle_notifier call chain.  Surely you're not saying that we 
can do a down_read() in this pathway?
And actually the chain's type doesn't seem to make much difference, since
at the moment there's nothing in the vanilla kernel that registers for the
idle_notifier chain.

Yes, I should have sent the patch to you too.  I apologize.
