ok - the issue is real, but there's a few implementational details. Did 
you know about task_delta_exec()? This new function duplicates that 
function's behavior - and task_delta_exec() is already used by posix 
task/cpu timers.
I find your new task_total_exec() interface better (it's easier to use), 
could you have a look at eliminating task_delta_exec() users and migrating 
them over to task_total_exec()?
Maybe even change the name of sum_exec_runtime over to __sum_exec_runtime, 
to make sure nobody uses the 'raw' value - which is always stale up to one 
tick's worth of execution. Accessing that raw value would only make sense 
after the task has finished executing. (i.e. at cutime/cstime collection 
time)
