But UNIX=m == waste RAM and have an effectively b0rken system until the 
module is loaded. It would be silly to do this unless you have a very small 
space for the kernel image and some free space for storing the needed 
modules. The big question is: Is there any non-embedded system where you 
have to aim for a small kernel image?
