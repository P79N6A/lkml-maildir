Not only the X server, the interactivity boost in general is way too
severe.  It still needs work, but it's shaping up.  Who knows, it may
even get to the point of applying for inclusion.
Now, let's see if we can get your problem fixed with something that can
possibly go into 2.6.16 as a bugfix.  Can you please try the below?
This patch fixes two of what I would call thinkos in the interactivity
logic.  One, the requeuing of a freshly awakened task can lead to that
task losing it's slice of cpu upon preempt if it isn't alone in it's
queue.  Two, tasks which sleep for > INTERACTIVE_SLEEP(p), approximately
700ms, are treated as being idle, and prevented from slamming straight
to max dynamic priority for obvious reasons, yet a pure cpu hog that
sleeps for 100ms will fail the test, and subsequently have it's sleep
time multiplied by MAX_BONUS.
Just in case it does fix it for you, I'll even add a blame line.
