This is the latest status of the epoll system include file and man pages
that I'll submit to Ulrich after having received comments from lkml. If
you have some feedback to report pls speak now or forever hold your piece :)
PS: Linus could you give me some feedback about the status of the epoll
patches I sent you for 2.5.49 ? The current kernel does not reflect this
interface and I won't post to Ulrich until all bits will be aligned.

.TH EPOLL 4 "23 October 2002" Linux "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
epoll \- edge triggered I/O readiness notification facility
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <sys/epoll.h>
.SH DESCRIPTION
epoll is the edge based variant of 
.BR poll (2)
and scales well to large numbers of watched fds. Three system calls are
provided to set up and control an
epoll set: 
.BR epoll_create (2) ,
.BR epoll_ctl (2) ,
.BR epoll_wait (2) .
An epoll set is connected to a file descriptor created by
.BR epoll_create (2) .
Interest for certain file descriptors is then registered via 
.BR epoll_ctl(2) .
Finally, the actual wait is started by 
.BR epoll_wait (2) .
.SH NOTES
epoll should not be regarded as a faster version of 
.BR poll (2)
because its semantics are fundamentally different. Whereas 
.BR poll (2)
and 
.BR select (2)
return immediately if any of their fds are available for reading,
writing or have an exceptional condition, epoll only returns if a
condition changes (level triggered vs. edge triggered). However,
epoll does scale better with large file descriptor sets.
epoll should be used with non-blocking file descriptors to avoid
having a blocking read or write starve the task that is handling
multiple file decriptors. The suggested way to use epoll is below,
and possible pitfalls to avoid follow.
.SR
.TP 
.B i
with non-blocking file descriptors
.TP 
.B ii
by going to wait for an event only after
.BR read (2)
or 
.BR write (2)
return EAGAIN
.SE
.SH EXAMPLE FOR SUGGESTED USAGE
In this example, listener is a non-blocking socket on which
.BR listen (2)
has been called. The function do_use_fd() uses the new ready
file descriptor until EAGAIN is returned by either
.BR read (2)
or
.BR write (2).
An event driven state machine application should, after having received
EAGAIN, record its current state so that at the next call to do_use_fd()
it will continue to
.BR read (2)
or
.BR write (2)
from where it stopped before.  
.nf
for(;;) {
    nfds = epoll_wait(kdpfd, &pfds, -1);
    for(n = 0; n < nfds; ++n) {
        if(pfds[n].fd == s) {
            client = accept(listener, (struct sockaddr*)&local, &addrlen);
            if(client < 0){
                perror("accept");
                continue;
            }
            setnonblocking(client);
            if (epoll_ctl(kdpfd, EPOLL_CTL_ADD, client, EPOLLIN) < 0) {
                fprintf(stderr, "epoll set insertion error: fd=%d\n", client);
                return -1;
            }
        }
        else
            do_use_fd(pfds[n].fd);
    }
}
.fi
For performance reasons, it is possible to add the file descriptor inside the
epoll interface ( 
.B EPOLL_CTL_ADD
 ) once by specifying (EPOLLIN | EPOLLOUT). This allows you to avoid continuously switching
between EPOLLIN and EPOLLOUT calling
.BR epoll_ctl (2)
with
.BR EPOLL_CTL_MOD .
.SH QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS (from linux-kernel)
.SR
.TP 
.B Q1 
What happens if you add the same fd to an epoll_set twice?
.TP
.B A1 
You will probably get EEXIST. However, it is possible that two
threads may add the same fd twice. This is a harmless condition.
.TP
.B Q2 
Can two epoll sets wait for the same fd? If so, are events reported
to both epoll sets fds?
.TP
.B A2
Yes. However, it is not recommended. Yes it would be reported to both.
.TP
.B Q3
Is the epoll fd itself poll/epoll/selectable?
.TP
.B A3
Yes.
.TP
.B Q4 
What happens if the epoll fd is put into its own fd set?
.TP
.B A4
It will fail. However, you can add an epoll fd inside 
another epoll fd set. 
.TP
.B Q5
Can I send the epoll fd over a unix-socket to another process?
.TP
.B A5
No.
.TP
.B Q6
Will the close of an fd cause it to be removed from all epoll sets automatically?
.TP
.B A6
Yes.
.TP
.B Q7 
If more than one event comes in between epoll_wait calls, are they combined
or reported separately?
.TP
.B A7
They will be combined.
.TP
.B Q8
Does an operation on an fd affect the already collected but not yet reported
events?
.TP
.B A8
You can do two operations on an existing fd. Remove would be meaningless for
this case. Modify will re-read available I/O.
.TP
.B Q9
Do I need to continuosly read/write an fd until EAGAIN ?
.TP
.B A9
No you don't. Receiving an event from
.BR epoll_wait (2)
should suggest you that such file descriptor is ready for the requested I/O
operation. You have simply to consider it ready until you will receive the
next EAGAIN. When and how you will use such file descriptor is entirely up
to you.
.SE
.SH POSSIBLE PITFALLS AND WAYS TO AVOID THEM
.SR
.TP
.B o False Positive 
.pp 
It is possible that while reading (assuming you are reading in a loop waiting for EAGAIN),
more I/O comes in for a second event. That I/O will be read immediately.  However, the next  
time you call epoll_wait on that fd, it will say there is an event ready even though the I/O 
for it has already been consumed. 
.pp
.nf
input0 -> triggers event0
epoll_wait () returns True 
	while (ret != EAGAIN){
		ret = read()
input1 -> triggers event1 but read() consumes input1 immediately
	}
epoll_wait () returns True but there is no input1 waiting.
read() returns EAGAIN immediately.
.fi
.pp
In the case of non-blocking file descriptors, this will result in the
next call to read immediately returning with EAGAIN. In the case of blocking
file descriptors, you will hang waiting to read I/O that is not there.
The author does not recommend using non-blocking sockets but will not stop you.
.pp
.pp 
One way to handle this is to mark the file descriptor as ready in its associated data 
structure after the first event is received, then ignore other events while it is in the 
ready state. When you read until receiving EAGAIN, set the ready state bit off before
calling epoll_wait again on that fd.
.pp
.TP
.B o Starvation 
.pp
If there is a large amount of I/O space, it is possible that by trying to drain
it the other files will not get processed causing starvation. This
is not specific to epoll.
.pp
.pp
The solution is to maintain a ready list and mark the file descriptor as ready
in its associated data structure, thereby allowing the application to
remember which files need to be processed but still round robin amongst
all the ready files. This also supports ignoring subsequent events you
receive for fd's that are already ready.
.pp
.TP
.B o If using an event cache...  
.pp
If you use an event cache or store all the fd's returned from epoll_wait,
then make sure to provide a way to mark its closure dynamically (ie- caused by 
a previous event's processing). Suppose you receive 100 events from 
epoll_wait, and in eventi #47 a condition causes event #13 to be closed. 
If you remove the structure and close() the fd for event #13, then your 
event cache might still say there are events waiting for that fd causing 
confusion.
.pp
.pp 
One solution for this is to call, during the processing of event 47,
epoll_ctl(EPOLL_CTL_DEL) to delete fd 13 and close(), then mark its associated
data structure as removed and link it to a cleanup list. If you find another
event for fd 13 in your batch processing, you will discover the fd had been
previously removed and there will be no confusion.

.BR "int epoll_create(int " size )
.SH DESCRIPTION
Open an
.B epoll
file descriptor by requesting the kernel allocate
an event backing store dimensioned for

.BR epoll_create (2)
must be closed by using
.BR close (2).
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
When successful,
.BR epoll_create (2)
returns a positive integer identifying the descriptor.
When an error occurs,

.TH EPOLL_WAIT 2 "23 October 2002" Linux "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
epoll_wait \- wait for an I/O event on an
.B epoll
file descriptor
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <sys/epoll.h>
.sp
.BR "int epoll_wait(int " epfd ", struct epoll_event * " events ", int " maxevents ", int " timeout)
.SH DESCRIPTION
Wait for events on the
.B epoll
file descriptor
.I epfd
for a maximum time of
.I timeout
milliseconds. The memory area pointed by
.I events
will contain the events that will be available for the caller.
Up to
.I maxevents
are returned by
.BR epoll_wait (2).
The
.I maxevents
parameter must be greater than zero. Specifying a
.I timeout
of \-1 makes
.BR epoll_wait (2)
wait indefinitely. The
.B struct epoll_event
is defined as :
.sp

	} epoll_data_t;
	struct epoll_event {
		__uint32_t events;	/* Epoll events */
		epoll_data_t data;	/* User data variable */
	};
.fi
The
.I data
of each returned structure will contain the same data the user set with a
.BR epoll_ctl (2)
.IR ( EPOLL_CTL_ADD , EPOLL_CTL_MOD )
while the
.I events
member will contain the returned event bit field.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
When successful, 
.BR epoll_wait (2)
returns the number of file descriptors ready for the requested I/O, or zero
if no file descriptor became ready during the requested
.I timeout
milliseconds.  When an error occurs, 
.BR epoll_wait (2)
returns \-1 and
.I errno
is set appropriately.
