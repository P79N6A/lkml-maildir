Hi all,
I have a LAN at home and know I just got another computer to
connect to the LAN, I also found a parallel-parallel cable. The
network is ethernet, is it possible to connect the new computer
using the parallel ports of the computers to the server of the
LAN so that this new computer is able to have access to the
internet and the rest of stuff?
What do I need to configure in the kernel?
Is there any how-to out there that answers this question?
Best regards,

	Yes, God had a deadline...
