Subject: -stable patch queue has moved to git
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

I've moved the -stable queue of patches (pending patches and those that
have already been applied) from a bitkeeper tree to git.  It can now be
found at:
	rsync://rsync.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/stable-queue.git
for those who are using git, and if you just want to browse the thing:
	
http://www.kernel.org/git/gitweb.cgi?p=linux
%2Fkernel%2Fgit%2Fgregkh%2Fstable-queue.git;a=log
If anyone has any questions about this tree, please let me know.
thanks,
greg k-h
