Well it's actually a good thing, because then at least it's not a bug
with the multi-frame extraction. So my guess would still be at the error
correction possibilities that the application has, in which case
CDROMREADAUDIO is just an inferior interface for this sort of thing. It
also doesn't give the issuer a chance to look at potential error
reasons, since the extended status isn't available.
