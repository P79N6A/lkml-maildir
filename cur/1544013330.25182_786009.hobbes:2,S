This gets lots of conflicts for me. Some of them look simple enough, but 
not all. io_apic.c gets lots of nasty conflicts, and it _looks_ like I 
should just pick the version of the file that I already have (because the 
only thing that comes in from that is yet another merge commit), but 
kernel/sched.c also gets conflicts in areas with FIXME's etc.
Rusty, Ingo, can you work this out? I pushed out my current tree.
