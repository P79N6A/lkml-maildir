Subject: BUG?: NFS client problems with 2.4.22

I have just compiled 2.4.22 with the NFS inode deadlock patch applied
from the 2.4.23-pre tree.
Configuration is SMP, athlon, bonding, eepro100, e1000, NFS v2 and 3
client.  Pretty basic.
Two nodes use only the eepro100 adapters, two nodes have bonded
eepro100 and e1000 adapters, both show the same issue.
This kernel is now producing "kernel: nfs: server not responding"
"kernel: nfs: server OK" messages at a rate of 5-10 per second.  It
looks like this kernel is ignoring the timeo option specified in
/etc/fstab and setting the timeout very small.  I currently have timeo
set to 40.
I'm using the following options on my nfs mounts:
rsize=8192,wsize=8192,hard,intr,timeo=40
Previous Redhat kernels 2.4.18 to 2.4.20-20 have not displayed this
problem.
Is this a known problem with the 2.4.22 kernel?
Thanks,
Joshua Weage
