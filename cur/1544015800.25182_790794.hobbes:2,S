It appears Jeremy is on vacation and I also don't know which of the
patches are meant for upstream (there seem still to be some bugs that
might need fixing), and it doesn't really matter if the XEN patches are
updated to your patch or the other way around.  The patches in the XEN
mercurial tree already do not apply the way they were before Jeremy went
on vacation, so in my opinion you can as well just go ahead.
Cheers,
