Just a crazy idea,..
Could there be a set_page_dirty() that doesn't have
balance_dirty_pages() call near? For example modifying meta data in
unlink?
Such a situation could lead to an excess of dirty pages and the next
call to balance_dirty_pages() would appear to stall, as it would
desperately try to get below the limit again.
