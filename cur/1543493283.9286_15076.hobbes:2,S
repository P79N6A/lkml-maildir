Of course not (only kpiod calls this).
But I was thinking about concurrent put_pio_requests (each on different
CPU) and put_pio_request vs get_pio_request (also on different CPUs).
Obviously, if all put_pio_requests are also protected by
kernel lock, things work fine, but is this really true? That's my
question...
