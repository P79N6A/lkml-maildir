Subject: 2.2.15pre7 spurious error returns from shutdown()

If you have a TCP socket and you call shutdown(socket, SHUT_WR) and
then later you call shutdown(socket, SHUT_RD) the second call will
return -ENOTCONN.  This is not what userland expects.  I see this
pattern in openssh 1.2.2 used to tunnel HTTP requests through a
firewall; you get a spurious error message for every HTTP connection.
The error comes from af_inet.c where we check for a connected socket
before calling the protocol shutdown method.  TCP read shutdown
doesn't actually do anything, so we should just suppress the error in
this case.  Patch:

A lot of the logic in inet_shutdown looks like it belongs in
tcp_shutdown instead, but tcp_shutdown can't return an error so we're
stuck with it.
