Greetings list
I am writing to enquire of the status of SGI Visual Workstation support
in the 2.5 series.
The Linux VISWS page on sourceforge
http://sourceforge.net/projects/linux-visws
Has a patch for 2.5.24
This currently doesn't apply 2.5.44 due to the i386 arch split in
2.5.37.
It seems the patch on the site developed from this thread, but ends
inconclusively:

Did anybody get it working more than this?
Does anybody have any more input about the VISWS code working/not
working?
I ask because I have a lot of VISWS 320 boxes at my disposal now and I
am interested in using them because of the really nice SCSI system they
have.  I've got one connected to a 20Gb DLT drive for doing backups
presently, running 2.2.10 (the only kernel I could get to work). But I
need a more recent kernal with netfilter for some firewalling issues.
Here was the patch for 2.4.17:
