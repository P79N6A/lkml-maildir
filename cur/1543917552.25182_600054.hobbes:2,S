Nicely done.  I know of some out of tree modules which use part of the
pv_cpu_ops and pv_mmu_ops, but we should not worry about such things,
and it turns out those modules don't need to be virtualized anyway.

I'm not against either approach.  I think the way you did it is fine.
If it were up to me, I would probably have driven myself crazy splitting
hairs on it until I was bald.

Ah yes, it is used there.  We actually exercise some of those paths, but
they don't need to be strictly virtualized.
