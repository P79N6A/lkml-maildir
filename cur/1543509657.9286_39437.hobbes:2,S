Because MODULE_NAME then gets foobar.c !? which is not a
usable/suitable prefix either? (The Makefile would create
foobar_ as prefix)
Or because you have to do it _before_ the #include of the
module.h header, which is messy and error-prone?
Hey, I really did think before I started modifying the
makefile. And - the filename is not such a bad choice either
in most cases. And the biggest advantage is that it works
without changing any driver source.
