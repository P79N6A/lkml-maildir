Ok - one vote for cpumask_t.
I could go either way.  I see that 'struct foo' is more common than
'foo_t' in kernel code.
I will not actually propose to change cpumask_t to 'struct cpumask'
unless others want it.  Without a half-way decent reason, it would just
be stupid churning.  But I wouldn't put up much resistance to such a
change.

In my view, right - you (seldom) need to look inside.  From what I can
make of Rusty's statements so far, he apparently has a different view ;).
We'll see.
