You wouldn't put a bdflush daemon in userspace either would you?  The 
loop in question is just that; (overly simplified):
while (1) {
	f = ask_kernel_if_anything_looks_inactive();
	if (f) {
		try_to_umount(f);
		continue;
	} else {
		sleep(x seconds);
	}
}
My point is, if this is the only active action done by userspace, why 
open it up to being broken?
