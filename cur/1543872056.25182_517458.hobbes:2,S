One think you could do is grab a reference to the pages upfront. When
you stop pushing data out to the userspace, or at least when the file
is released, you need to drop that reference again. You could even do
a kmap_atomic(), which would give you a kernel space mapping. That
way, you avoid copy_to_user for that data.
I am not sure if that's the "proper way", just my $0.02 how I would
try to solve it.
