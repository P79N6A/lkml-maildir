	Hehe, actually, at the moment it isn't doing anything, though I'd be
more than happy to do just about anything to it.  It's more-or-less my playtoy
for a little while, we're testing having Linux running on a Sparc.  The CPU's
are TI's, 60mhz.  Also there is only two of them.  Have any thoughts on
something I could use to generate a similar load to what you have to see if
that makes a difference?
