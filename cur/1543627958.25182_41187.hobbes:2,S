There was a paper presented at SCM8 on just such a system.  They used Emacs.
    Multi-Grain Version Control in the Historian System
    Makram Abu-Shakra and Gene L. Fisher
    California Polytechnic State University, USA
    This paper describes Historian, a version control system that supports
    comprehensive versioning and features to aid history
    navigation. Comprehensive versioning is supported through frequent and
    automated creation of versions which typically results in a large number
    of versions. To reduce user overhead in history navigation, the
    hierarchical structure present in most documents is utilized to support
    fine-grained version control. The series of document editing operations is
    also organized hierarchically and can be used for navigation as well.
