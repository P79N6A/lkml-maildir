Well, umount -l can be handy, but it does not allow you to get your CD
back from the drive.
umount --kill that kills whoever is responsible for filesystem being
busy would solve part of the problem (that can be done in userspace,
today).
Of course, even nicer would be "filesystem goes away now, all
operations fail", but that needs kernel support.

Agreed. When some machine refuses to eject cd because it is
busy... That's bad. I have strong temptation to just remove AC power,
plug it back and then claim my CD...
