During writing a driver for a PCI board I experienced the hardware 
hanging and I had to press the big red button. The hang was traced 
using a PCI analyzer and I found that the driver, loaded as a 
module, was taking a route which called panic. I changed 
/proc/sys/kernel/panic to a non zero value and the machine started 
to reboot on PCI hang. My problem is I never see any output on the 
screen or in /var/log/messages. All the stuff I have looked at in 
/usr/src/linux/Documentation suggests the messages should be 
here. I am running a 2.4.0 kernel with a SuSE 7.1 installation. At 
the hang time the system is running kde 2 and in a command 
winow I have a tail -f /var/log/messages running. The first change I 
see is the PC bios startup. 
Please Help
Simon.
