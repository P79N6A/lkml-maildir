I only agree with RMS to a point.  Something like google or Ebay would 
still be very much possible in a world where most software was 
GPLed/BSD/etc..  Why wouldn't it be?

For every Larry and Sergey, I am sure you know ten Tom, Dick and 
Harry's who slave away doing amazing things at a large software 
development house. Besides, my reading of the GPL suggests you only 
need to publish source code _IF_ you distribute it to a 3rd party.  In 
house software development would not qualify.

Again I don't see why Google or Ebay wouldn't exist in a Free Software 
world nor do I see why Larry and Sergey wouldn't make a butt load.  
I think it is important to remember that copyright law was not designed to 
make you or anyone else "rich".  Copyright law is concerned with 
promoting societies progress.
