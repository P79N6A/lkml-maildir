Nope.  Good catch ... haven't had a chance to try that yet with that driver;
not all drivers actually need to drop chipselect like that.
Any other comments about that approach to the "let someone else manage the
queue"?  This one's more clearly "implementation utilities" than what you had
seemed to be talking about before, but I think it does address a point where
I think we were agreeing:  it should be easy for people to whip together a
controller driver by providing just some lower level I/O calls.
