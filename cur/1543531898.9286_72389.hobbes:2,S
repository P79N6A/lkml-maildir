This is almost true already. The number of cylinders is meaningless
and not used anywhere anyway. The number of sectors per track is 63.
The number of heads is 16.
So, there is no variable anymore and geometry is dead.
There are proposals for the next ATA standard that will handle
larger than 137 GB disks. There are proposals that forbid such
drives to understand CHS.

Since hdparm is not fdisk, LILO or the kernel, just disregard.
There is no problem, except that it would be better if hdparm
did not print these things at all.
