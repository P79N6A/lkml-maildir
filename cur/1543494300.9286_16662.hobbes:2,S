I was using 2.2.5 with vesa video mode 0x307 (1280x1024 with 8bpp) and
decided to rev up to 2.2.7.  When I booted the system with 2.2.7, the
screen went to black on black when it switched into vesa mode.  I
fixed it by reseting the vga mode to 0, but it would be nice to have a
larger screen in text mode (particularly since I direct syslog output
to tty6, so I can easily check what the last messages were).  I also
tried 2.2.6 with the same results.  I diffed drivers/video/vesafb.c
and the only change was in setting the mtrr area, so it must be
something higher up.
My hardware is a dual 500Mhz pentium-III, Intel L440GX+ motherboard,
256 meg of memory, Diamond Viper 550 PCI video card, both the builtin
Adpatec 7896 and an add-on TekRam 390U scsi controllers, a pile of
disks, scanner, cd-rom burner, and DAT tape drive.  I do not
overclock.
