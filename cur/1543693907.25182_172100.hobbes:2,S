Or more simple - keep a copy of the kernel where your patches got applied,
and make a diff between that kernel and latest.
Apply that diff to your local tree, and you are up-to-date.
This gives a good opportunity to review what has been applied without
passing the maintainer.
And finally it also resolve potential conflicts.
And as always - the more frequent you get patches applied, the less burden
it is to update to latest kernel.
