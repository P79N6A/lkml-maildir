The latencies are almost certainly caused by the USB host controller 
driver.  I'm planning improvements to uhci-hcd which should help reduce 
the latency, but it will still be on the large side.  And I won't have 
time to write the changes to the driver for several months.
The best solution is to stop using uhci-hcd.  Get a PCI card with an OHCI 
or EHCI (high-speed) controller.  They do much more work in hardware, 
reducing the amount of time the driver needs to spend with interrupts 
disabled.
