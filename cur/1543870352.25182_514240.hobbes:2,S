yeah, that's another difference - especially if it's something like an 
Athlon64 and gettimeofday falls back to pm-timer, that could explain the 
performance difference. That's why i repeatedly asked Evgeniy to use the 
/very same/ client function for both the epoll and the kevent test and 
redo the measurements. The numbers are still highly suspect - and we are 
already down from the prior claim of kevent being almost twice as fast 
to a 25% difference.
