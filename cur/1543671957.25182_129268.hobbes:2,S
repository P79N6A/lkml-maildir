Sounds good! I will look into 2.5 soon. But I fear that a lot of time 
will pass until 2.6 is available and I think it is a good interim 
solution for the 2.4 users.

that's why I would prefer a LKM instead of a kernel patch. If you know a 
clean way to save/restore irq-handlers please let me know. That would 
also allow to make it portable to other platforms like Apple iBook or 
notebooks with other than PS/2 trackpads.
Implementing an ioctl() is a nice idea too. But why not have it 
configurable via the /proc interface? If you use ioctl() you still need 
to write a userspace program. Ok, that's not difficult, but I think it's 
more comfortable if you can simply use
   #/etc/rc.d/trackpad, set trackpad delay time
   echo "trackpad delay=2000" > /proc/something
   #/etc/hotplug???  external mouse is just plugged in, disable trackpad
   echo "trackpad disable=1" > /proc/something
   #/etc/hotplug???  external mouse is just revmoved, re-enable trackpad
   echo "trackpad disable=0" > /proc/something

yes ok, so I can save one variable. But I would than have to make the 
enable_trackpad_timer a static global var. That's not really bad, but I 
feel that "complex datastructures" better hidden in a function, - but 
it's only a "feeling"
