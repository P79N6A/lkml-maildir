Hi,
2.5 limits are the same as 2.4.recent AFAIK, but swapfiles in 2.5 work as
well (fast) as swap partitions if I recall Andrew Morton's comments
correctly.
From 
http://www.xenotime.net/linux/doc/swap-mini-howto.txt
:
3.  Swap space limits
Linux 2.4.10 and later, and Linux 2.5 support any combination of swap
files or swap devices to a maximum number of 32 of them.  Prior to Linux
2.4.10, the limit was any combination of 8 swap files or swap devices.  On
x86 architecture systems, each of these swap areas has a limit of 2 GiB.
