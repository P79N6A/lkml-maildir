Perhaps I missed it, but what's the rationale for complaining about
0-sized allocations?  They seem like a perfectly reasonable thing to me;
they turn up at the boundary conditions of many algorithms, and avoiding
them just cruds up the callsites to make them go through hoops to avoid
allocation. 
Why not just do a 1 byte allocation instead, and be done with it?  Any
non-constant-sized allocation will potentially have to deal with this
case, so it seems to me we could just put the fix in common code (and
use an inline wrapper to avoid it when dealing with constant non-zero
sized allocations).
