We don't do any pte page reclaim at any time other than process exit and
there are plenty of pte pages we can just plain free anyway.  Anthing
that's completely mapping page cache, for instance.
In the replacement case, taking mm->page_table_lock, doing the copy, and
replacing the pointer from the pmd should be all that it takes.  But, I
wonder if we could miss any sets of the pte dirty bit this way...
