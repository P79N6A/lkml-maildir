It's not quite that simple; lguest's paravirt_ops->cpuid sets TSC off,
and indeed X86_FEATURE_TSC isn't set in boot_cpu_data.x86_capability.
But TSC is a "required feature", so "cpu_has_tsc" is always true.
How about this patch:
===
Don't try to disable the TSC: it's a required feature under modern
configurations, so just mark the sched clock unstable which has the
same effect.
