Ouch - As I mentioned a few days ago, the Ex000 range can have a
mixture of SBUS and PCI. This configuration is becoming increasingly
common as these machines are upgraded to attach to SAN stuff and
other FCAL variants for which there is no SBUS card.
Please take a few moments to keep this, it works at the moment.
