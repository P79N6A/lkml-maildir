I never thought to disable the reset, getting rid of the SCSI resets
probably cuts 10-20 seconds off my boot time.
You can turn of the AIC driver reset, and shorten the selection timeout,
see linux/drivers/scsi/README.aic7xxx for details.
With my hardware, I can also disable the BIOS reset, and limit BIOS
scanning from the BIOS config screen (hit ctl-A during boot).
On my system, it saves me about 10 seconds to boot with:
lilo: linux-1 aic7xxx=no_reset aic7xxx=seltime:3
There are no options in linux scsi to limit the scanning of the target
id's or channels, I don't think there are any in the AIC driver either.
You could hack the driver and lower the max_id, and/or lower max_channel,
or somehow disable unused channels, but I doubt it will save much time
(7 id's * 2 channels * 32 ms/per-selection-timeout or so).
