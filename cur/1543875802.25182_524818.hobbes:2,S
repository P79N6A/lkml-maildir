ARM Normal memory (RAM) accesses are weakly ordered, so on SMP, you
need barriers.  (SMP ARM systems are the definite minority, though.)
(For ARM UP, we generally don't care, since most have virtual caches
and are not I/O coherent, and so DMA coherent mappings will be done
as uncached mappings, and uncached mappings are strongly ordered --
except on XScale V3, which supports I/O coherency, and so you need to
use barriers when operating on DMA coherent memory because DMA coherent
mappings are done as Normal memory (which is weakly ordered) when I/O
coherency is enabled.)

No idea -- I assume Catalin has looked at this.
