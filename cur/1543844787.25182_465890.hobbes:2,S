This is a 2.4 fix (not needed in 2.6): let's CC maintainer Willy Tarreau.

Good point, thanks for the patch.  Sorry I'm so slow to get to it.

And still needs fixing in latest mainline 2.4.

I'm afraid the tabs got messed up in both the old and new lines.
Also, count is a signed int (whereas size and max_mapnr are both
unsigned longs), so best reject "count <= 0" rather than just "!count".

Here's a replacement patch for Willy.  Anatoli, you didn't sign
off the patch yourself: so I'm assuming Michael is the originator.

(max_mapnr << PAGE_SHIFT) would overflow on a system which has
4GB memory or more, and so could cause vmap to fail every time.
