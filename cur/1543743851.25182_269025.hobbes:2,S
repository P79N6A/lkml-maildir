Hi,
i tried to build a kernel outside the src dir using <src dir>/make O=<build 
dir>. This failed because of
1. scripts/kbuild/zconf.tab.c not available in the <src dir>
2. usr/initramfs_list not available in the <build dir>
After copying the files by hand it worked. Something wrong on my side? I'm 
using 2.6.10-rc1.
Thanks,
  Florian
