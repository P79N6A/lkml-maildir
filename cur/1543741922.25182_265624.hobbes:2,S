I'm using 2.6.10-rc1 and got the following error ...
# vgscan
   Reading all physical volumes.  This may take a while...
   Found volume group "vg01" using metadata type lvm2
# vgchange -a y
   0 logical volume(s) in volume group "vg01" now active
# lvcreate -L 100M -n lv01 vg01
   device-mapper ioctl cmd 0 failed: Inappropriate ioctl for device
   striped: Required device-mapper target(s) not detected in your kernel
   lvcreate: Create a logical volume
Can't create logical volume (lvcreate) using 2.6.10-rc1.
No problem with 2.6.9 and 2.4.28-rc1.
Lvm tools is LVM2.2.00.25.
Here's my partial .config (same as 2.6.9 which is working with lvm).
#
# Multi-device support (RAID and LVM)
#
CONFIG_MD=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_MD=m
# CONFIG_MD_LINEAR is not set
# CONFIG_MD_RAID0 is not set
# CONFIG_MD_RAID1 is not set
# CONFIG_MD_RAID10 is not set
# CONFIG_MD_RAID5 is not set
# CONFIG_MD_RAID6 is not set
# CONFIG_MD_MULTIPATH is not set
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_DM=y
# CONFIG_DM_CRYPT is not set
# CONFIG_DM_SNAPSHOT is not set
# CONFIG_DM_MIRROR is not set
# CONFIG_DM_ZERO is not set
Thanks,
Jeff.
