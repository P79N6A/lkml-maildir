It's still unclear to me why DISABLE_IMMEDIATE is needed. It would
be better to make it just the default.

There are no such on x86 at least  And for other architectures like
PPC it would be better to have a high level CONFIG_READ_ONLY_TEXT
then that does the necessary changes internally.  But I'm not sure it's even 
supporting r/o text.
