The x86 like behaviour happens on ppc64 too:
exceptions enabled: 0
exceptions enabled: 4000000
hello
in handler
abort
a/b=inf
terminating
There is a reason for this. A signal handler might want to do floating
point so exceptions are disabled upon entering a signal handler.
Now the question that needs to be answered is whether sigsetjmp should
save the floating point exception register. I asked our resident
standards expert Chris Yeoh and the answer is no.
So the x86, ppc32 and ppc64 behaviour looks correct.
