	Hello Vladimir,  This patch finnally allowed me to connect
	to my provider using 2.3.13+ .  It also -seems- to allow for
	a more even thru-put under 2.0.37+ .
	The pppstats reported thru-put shows a bit more evenness in the
	reported numerics .  on a I-modem single channel connection
	under 2.1.33+(the patch) the numerics range from 37500 - 40000
	normally , But still will drop off to almost nothing occasionally
	(or even stop:-() , but under 2.0.37+ without the patch the
	numerics were all over the place the highest they ever got were
	41500+/- .  Also all numerics are download only .  When there is
	a glitch in the numerics there is not an increase in out-bound
	traffic , So I beleive that outbound traffic shouldn't be an
	issue at this time .		Tnx again,  JimL
