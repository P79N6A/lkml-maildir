Yes.

Yes. We see problems only when we oversubscribe memory.

No not yet. I can give it a try.

I think that is unlikely -- because when we donot oversubscribe
memory, the tests complete quickly without softlockups ane the like.  Peter 
has also noticed this (presumeably on different hardware).  I would think
this could also be locking unfairness (cpus of the same node getting the 
lock and starving out other nodes) case under extreme contention.
