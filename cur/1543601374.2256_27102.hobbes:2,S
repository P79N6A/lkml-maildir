yes, it wasn't relly useful to keep this list lazily, you either keep it
enforced with locking overhead or such information isn't valuable.

I don't see your point with "page freeing more aggressive over time".

I'm deeply impressed, you seem to have understood the rewrite greatly
well, congrats, this "hiding" was infact my main concern I had on the
memclass check during shrink_cache, but I don't think this will ever
give us troubles.  In such there are suprious swapouts with HIGHMEM
we'll just need to waste some cpu by lefting those pages visible with a
few changes in shrink_cache, but again I'm almost sure there won't be
problems, we do multiple scans before failing so those pages will return
visible before the other task has a chance to fail the allocation.
