Mainboard VIA EPIA mini-ITX with VIA C3 800 Mhz or 500 Mhz
I faced with strange problem connected to this mainboard.
Kernel crashed when attempt to configrue net interface. 
I tried to make linux terminal based on this mainboard.
I use diet-pc project as base for this approach - diet-pc.sourceforge.net.
Kernel crashed when 'pump' tried to configure eth0 via dhcp.
Kernel also crashed when it tried to configure eth0 via dhcp ( CONFIG_IP_PNP & 
CONFIG_IP_PNP_DHCP ).
This problem occured _very_ rarely. ( about 1 time of 12-20 start/reboots of 
computer)
Driver used : via-rhine.
I also tried driver from VIA (linuxfet.c) . Result is same.
I tried various 2.2 - 2.4 kernels  ( including last pre11 patch ).
And when net interface configured it works fine.
I tried 4(!) mainboards.
The problem disappeared when I disabled on board LAN  
and install Realtek 8139C NIC. 
So I think that problem in driver.  Am I right ?
Can somebody help me or comment this problem?
Regards,
	Serge.
