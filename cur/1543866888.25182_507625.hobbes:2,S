I see... how terribly obvious.
As far as I know, the 4xx UIC does things correctly, though I don't
have handy any devices with edge interrupts to test it with.
It would still be nice to have this change, so we can use the
lazy-masking from handle_edge_irq(), but I guess I can do without it
for now.
