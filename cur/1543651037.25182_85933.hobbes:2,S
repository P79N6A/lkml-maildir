I'm going to need some help understanding what's going on in
there.  I assume the test is SDET (there, I said it), which
simulates lots of developers doing developer things on a multiuser
machine.  Lots of compiling, groffing, etc.
Why does the removal of `ps' from the test script make such a huge
difference?  That's silly, and we should fix it.
And it appears that dcache-rcu made a ~10% difference on a 24-way PPC64,
yes?  That is nice, and perhaps we should take that, but it is not a
tremendous speedup.
Thanks.
