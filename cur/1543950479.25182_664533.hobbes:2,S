You're using an Itanium kernel on Opteron?

If the hardware "didn't change" then it could be a BIOS bug, or just a 
different BIOS behavior that your old kernel doesn't handle well.  Try 
the same version you had on the old hardware.  I once had a desktop box 
that developed a similar behavior when I twiddled the memory hole 
remapping settings in the BIOS.
