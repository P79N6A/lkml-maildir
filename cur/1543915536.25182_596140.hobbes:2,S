What is your point, really?
Let me repeat the situation:
I own a computer (maybe portable one, such as a laptop) that I want to
protect from attackers with physical access to my system. You're proposing
a scheme that claims to secure it (against attackers with physical access)
but assumes: "barring disassembling the system".
Dude, looks like you're selling snake oil here.

Precisely. Do you think the above attack is "fantastical"?
Wow, you're amazingly naive ... good luck ;-)
[ See, if it's only your kid sister that you want to "protect" your
  36GB worth of porn from, then you might as well use Windoze and one of
  those cute little "folder-locking" tool that we wrote back in 5th grade.
  However, if "hapless North Korean spy in Washington" describes you more
  accurately, then you better be ready for all sorts of attacks -- from
  exploding cigars [1], to poisoned ballpoint pens [2] :-)
  In short, you have no clue what you're talking about, and thankfully
  I'm not using any security software you had any part in designing :-) ]

Thanks for repeatedly making *my* point :-)
_You_ are the one who claimed protecting systems from attackers with
physical access to be a "fairly simple" problem ... and here you're
mentioning how *difficult* it is ...

You might carry it home, might you not? What if your lover/girlfriend/wife
is one of them? [3]

Hmm, you'd need to be a mutant to keep "close enough eyes" on your stuff
while you're sleeping ... or drugged (?)

ROTFL ... these "workarounds" above are even more hilarious than your
earlier "fairly simple" claim.

Dude, if the data in there is really that important, then better not
store it on a computer / disk at all :-)

Surprisingly, you have (somewhat of) a point (!)

"If"? Was there ever any doubt?
Heh, did you even read the thread you just replied to?
We're talking of consoles / hardware sold by commercial companies to
users here, where they want explicitly want to prevent the users from
being able to hack it. So yes, end user == attacker.

Ah, finally you make my point again for me :-)
Thanks for the laughs,
