Indeed, similar, but different.

Those names are a lot longer than the others in that file.
I still prefer MADV_DONTFORK etc. myself.  Or the original MADV_DONTCOPY,
though I think you were quite right to point out it's all about forking.

There are lots of levels on which there's copying or not.  The name
VM_DONTCOPY means "don't copy this vma when forking", it's not thinking
of copying pages or even of copying ptes: just don't copy this vma into
the child.
