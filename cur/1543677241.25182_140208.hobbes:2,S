Hi Arjan,
OK, that would explain why I see an old problem (*) re-appear in my 
application that was solved/worked-around by using O_DIRECT when using
2.4.20-18.9.
Just to make sure I understand it correctly, is it like this: ?
   "Kernel 2.4.20-18.9 completely ignores the O_DIRECT flag.  Not only the
    "synchronous writes part" but also you will get read-ahead despite
    using O_DIRECT.  The 2.4.20-18.9 with O_DIRECT behaviour is similar to
    the 2.4.18-27.7.x without O_DIRECT (concerning synchronity of write()
    and the number of physical media reads & writes)."
Just curious: what is the reason for ignoring O_DIRECT in 2.4.20-18.9 ?
Interactivity behaviour ?

(*) I have an application that runs from CompactFlash that uses a Philips
    webcam (pwc driver).  It turned out that too much CompactFlash access
    (in PIO mode) causes the camera(driver?) to stall and never wake up
     again :-(  I only log 2048 byte records to a raw partition.  With
    O_DIRECT and proper data aligning I could reduce the CF-access to
    exactly 4 512 byte sector writes.  This was enough to never trigger
    the problem.
