2% overhead for a pte-intensive workload for unknown reasons four years

We still don't know what is the source of kmap() activity which
necessitated this patch btw.  AFAIK the busiest source is ext2 directories,
but perhaps NFS under certain conditions?

->prepare_write no longer requires that the caller kmap the page.
