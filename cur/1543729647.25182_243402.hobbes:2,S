See

 (which may not
be the best interpretation of the changes)
Basically it was added a "linuxcheck" function which you're not allowed to
modify or delete. The function has a "warning", which results in something
like:
cdrecord: Warning: Running on Linux-2.6.8
cdrecord: There are unsettled issues with Linux-2.5 and newer.
cdrecord: If you have unexpected problems, please try Linux-2.4 or Solaris.
(Dunno what it prints out when you're running suse but I don't think linux
vendors are going to distribute software which says that their own software
has issues.)
