The "model", as it were, for pagetable updats, is a 3-stage model:
(1) prepare
(2) update
(3) commit
update_mmu_cache() is stage (3). Linux' software pagetable
modifications are step (2). Generally, architectures are trying to fold
stages (2) and (3) together in set_huge_pte(), so update_mmu_cache() is
not so much of an issue for them (and it's actually incorrect to do
this multiple times or without the architectures' awareness of hugepages
in update_mmu_cache() and so on). To completely regularize the hugetlb
case, merely move the commitment to cpu-native structures or other TLB
insertion done within set_huge_pte() to a new case in update_mmu_cache()
for large pages.
What is in fact far more pressing is flush_dcache_page(), without a
correct implementation of which for hugetlb, user-visible data
corruption follows.
