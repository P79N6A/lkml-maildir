Alan,
I'm working on a device driver for a device that sits on the PC
memory bus.  I need to reserve/protect the memory range that the
device occupies from the rest of the kernel/system.  How do I do
that?  I think I see how I can mark blocks that are never to be
touched, but in this case the driver (obviously) needs to be able to 
touch them, but the rest of the kernel must be hands-off.
