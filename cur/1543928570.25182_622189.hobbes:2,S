Understood. But I didn't know to pull it in or not. So I used your
explanation to NACK it myself. I don't understand all the intricacies of
the arm architecture. So while Thomas is out, I'm not pulling this in.
If he comes back and gives his ACK, I'll simply NACK my NACK ;-)

This could also simply be unique to the interrupt threads (only in RT). So
perhaps the patch is OK.
Remy, sorry about this round-a-bout. But I don't have any of the hardware
that this affects, and I'm just being cautious.
Thanks,
