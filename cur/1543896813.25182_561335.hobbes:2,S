Quite frankly, it strikes me that if we want to do this, then we shouldn't 
save the _process_ information at all, we should save the "sighand" 
instead.
So either we save the process info, or we save the sighand, but saving the 
"group_leader" seems totally bogus. Especially as the group leader can 
change (by execve()).
One thing that strikes me as I look at that function is that the whole 
signalfd thing doesn't seem to do any reference counting. Ie it looks 
totally buggy wrt passing the resulting fd off to somebody else, and then 
exiting in the original process.
What did I miss?
