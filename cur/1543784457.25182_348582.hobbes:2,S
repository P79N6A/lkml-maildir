You need either another CPU, or semaphore which do not suffer from starvation.
Or you have to rewrite ncpfs to use some queue instead of simple
semaphore.  What happens is that your copy process in a loop acquires
ncp_server's semaphore, sends request to server, waits for response, and
releases semaphore.  It does that for every request sent out.  Now your
process comes in, finds that ncp_server's semaphore is locked, and starts
waiting.  Other process gets answer from server, releases semaphore, and
as both processes were just waiting before this happened, they both have
same priority, and so one which just did up() continues to run.  And
before waken up process gets chance to do its task, copy process sends
another request, and so your second process goes to sleep again.
