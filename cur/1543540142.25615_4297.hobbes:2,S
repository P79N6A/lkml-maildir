   What about the open() path? They have (or grab) BKL there, so it should
   not be something special. Now, read() and write()...

   massive overkill.
Do we still have a problem with the metadata races?  
(Yeah, I still have to look at the proposed ext2 patches.  They're high

Alan?  Do you remember which one you were referring to?
