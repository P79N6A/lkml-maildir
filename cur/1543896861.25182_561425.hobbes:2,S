Of course there is Christoph.
If you have a system which generates and loads modules then they can't be
in tree (as they don't exist except transiently). On the other hand if it
outputs java byte codes then a JVM to process them can be in tree. It
would be a stupid solution to the problem but you appear to be objecting
to sane ones.
The system to create the dynamic modules could certainly be in-tree but to
argue that code dynamically created should be "in tree" already is a
bit silly really isn't it ?
A second way of point out your argument is totally and utterly bogus
would be the MODULE_ interface. The modutils are clearly out of tree
users.
So whats the difference between modutils and markers ? Would it suddenely
change if modutils developed modinfo --dump-markers ?
