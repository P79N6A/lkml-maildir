I don't have any docs myself, Paul might be the one to talk to as he's
done the most recent research on this (though some of it directly with
Alpha engineers, if I remember correctly).
IIRC some alpha models have split cache close to what you describe in
#3, however I'm not sure of the fine details (eg. I don't think the
split caches are redundant, but just treated as two entities by the
cache coherence protocol).
Again, I don't have anything definitive that you can put in your docco,
sorry.

I don't think it has to[*]. It would guarantee the _order_ in which
"global memory" of this model ie. visibility for other "CPUs" see the
writes, whether that visibility ultimately be implemented by cache
coherency protocol or something else, I don't think matters (for a
discussion of memory ordering). If anything it confused the matter
for the case of Alpha.
All the programmer needs to know is that there is some horizon (memory)
beyond which stores are visible to other CPUs, and stores can travel
there at different speeds so later ones can overtake earlier ones. And
likewise loads can come from memory to the CPU at different speeds too,
so later loads can contain earlier results.
[*] Nor would your model require a smp_wmb() to update CPU caches either,
I think: it wouldn't have to flush the store buffer, just order it.
