Hello linux-experts,
    I have a small doubt regarding kernel hooks. when
I searched for it in the net, the information provided
was ambiguous. so, can any one give me details
regarding it preferably URLs, e-books and if possible
some sample code from the kernel source. What is their
main work?
Regards,
selva
