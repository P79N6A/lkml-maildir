Wrong:
- the kernel cannot figure out if a thread owns a normal spinlock(): 
in_atomic detects spin_lock_bh(), irqs_disabled spin_lock_irq(). But 
spin_lock has no global state.
- dito for get_cpu()/put_cpu users.
- dito for rcu users, or anyone else that uses preempt_disable() for 
whatever purpose
