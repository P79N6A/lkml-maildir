Generally, the "link is xyz" message comes directly after loading the module,
so it should be eth0 before udev gets a chance to rename it. Or maybe not -
in which case, well, you're literally fubared, and your distro should put a
"renamed A to B" into syslog.

Oh I think it already has a "primary name" today --
$ readlink /sys/class/net/eth0/device
../../../../../devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:04.0
there is your primary name, and your secondary name is ethZ. :)
