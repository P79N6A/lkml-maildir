The "cardctl status" command says whether cards are CardBus or 16-bit.
Someone else suggested checking the "keys" on the PCMCIA connector.
These are keyed to the voltage(s) supported by the card.  The vast
majority of 16-bit cards are keyed for 5V, and all CardBus cards are
currently keyed for 3.3V.  But the voltage keys aren't 100% reliable,
because 16-bit cards with 3.3V keys do exist.
There's another easy way to distinguish CardBus cards.  All CardBus
cards have a row of eight sharp dimples on the top of the card along
the edge that has the CardBus connector.  These are part of the spec,
and connect to a ground plate in the CardBus socket.
The Xircom REM56G is a 16-bit card, even though it is 10/100.  At
100baseT, it will be faster than 10baseT, but that's about all you can
say about it.  The best performance I've seen from a 16-bit card at
100baseT is about 1.5 MB/sec.
