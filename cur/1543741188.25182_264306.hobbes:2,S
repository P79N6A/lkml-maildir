Wrong - the CGA/MDA cards didn't come with any BIOS on them, and all the
support routines were (and most probably still are) located in the
system BIOS. The first card that replaced IRQ 10 with it's own set of
routines was the EGA and used its own BIOS ROM for that.
So there is no need to have a BIOS on the card to still see the system
BIOS boot messages.
