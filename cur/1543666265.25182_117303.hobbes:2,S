See, this is a free world, and I very much respect your opinion. On the
other side you might want to actually *read* the kqueue man page and find
out of its 24590 flags, where 99% of its users will use only 1% of its
functionality. Talking about overbloating. You might also want to know
that quite a few kqueue users currently running on your favourite OS, are
moving to Linux+epoll. The reason is still unclear to me, but I can leave
you to discover it as exercise.
