It's particularly confusing for users, because it's a per-user limit
rather than a per-process one, and its not at all apparent which program
is causing the problem (/proc/N/status will tell you that a process has
a signal pending, but it won't tell you how many are pending).
In fact, bugs with these symptoms have been reported against Valgrind
from time to time for years, and its only recently I worked out what's
going on (mostly because I introduced a bug which caused Valgrind to do
it to itself).

I suppose, but it doesn't "force" it really.  The allocation could still
fail (it is GFP_ATOMIC after all), and you'd still get no siginfo.  I
don't care much either way.

I can't think of a case where they wouldn't be, but I wanted to make
sure this couldn't be used to create a new DoS.

Fault signals rarely have an si_code of SI_KERNEL (0x80); they generally
have a small integer to describe what the fault was really about
(SEGV_MAPERR, etc).  All si_codes > SI_USER (0) are defined to have come
from the kernel.  Hm, I see there's a macro, SI_FROMKERNEL, for doing
this test.
Updated patch attached.
