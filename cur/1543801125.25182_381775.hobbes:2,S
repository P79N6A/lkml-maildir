Moving code out-of-line can have some serious drawbacks, too.  For example,
if you have a 12 byte function that is called frequently, you are pinning
an additional 52 bytes of code in the L1 cache.  Unless that code is also
called often you might waste more space than you gain from un-inlining.
E.g. a look at arch/i386/kernel/apic.c shows a bunch of functions that are
only there because of CPU hotplug, to handle errors or deal with
suspend/resume/shutdown.  Such code should be in its own text section.
And the only way to get meaningful benchmarks so you can figure out where
to place the code would be to instrument the kernel and then run real-world
applications.
