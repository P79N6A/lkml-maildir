The calls in drivers/base/sys.c to sysdev_show(), which seem to resolve
to the routines node_read_cpumap() and node_read_meminfo() in node.c,
do not take any buffer count (size).  They used to, by Patrick removed
the count parameter in Jan 2003, from here and other such places.
What's to keep the node_read_*() sprintf's from overrunning these
buffers?
I am developing some changes to the cpumask_t print routines, which
include using snprintf() instead of sprintf(), and watching buffer
limits.  These changes are motivated by the need to handle such things
as 512 CPUs.
I couldn't plug my new routine into read_cpumap() to display the
node_dev->cpumap (a cpumask_t), for want of a buffer count.
