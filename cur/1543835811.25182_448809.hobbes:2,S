which does absolutly no good if someone trips over the power cord, the fuse 
blows in the power supply, someone yanks the drive out of the hot-swap bay, etc.

as I understand it flash reads are fast (ram speeds), but writes are pretty slow 
(comparable or worse to spinning media)
writing to a ram cache, but having a flash drive behind it doesn't gain you any 
protection. and I don't think you need it for reads

remember, it can take 90W of power to run your CPU, 100+ to run your video card, 
plus everything else. even a few seconds of power for this is a very significant 
amount of energy storage.
however, I did get a pointer recently at a company makeing super-high capcity 
caps, up to 2600F (F, not uF!) in a 138mmx tall 57mm dia cyliner, however it 
only handles 2.7v (they have modules that handle higher voltages available)

however I don't see these as being standard equipment in systems or on drives 
anytime soon
