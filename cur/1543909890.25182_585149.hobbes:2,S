What exactly the difference between kzalloc and kcalloc? From the
definition, I could see that kcalloc should be used for array
allocation. But I could see kzalloc is used for allocation arrays as in
the below patch.
Any coding standard (or) developers can use kzalloc and kcalloc as per
their coding practice??
Thanks,
~Siva
