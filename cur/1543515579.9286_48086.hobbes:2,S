These are Linux man pages, are they not?

1. man pages should not rant about kernel design choices
2. man pages should not encourage _or_ discourage portability
Man pages exist to document the system. That is their primary function.
It is also nice to document portability issues, but this is secondary.
Those that wish to write portable software may purchase a copy
of "Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment" or POSIX itself.

Being "portable" seems oddly like being "politically correct".
Being "portable" is relative. One may choose "all x86", "all BSD",
"all 64-bit Linux", "all big-endian 32-bit SysV" or even "all Win32".
To varying degree, most people don't give a damn. If you think you
are an exception... does your software support v6 UNIX?

No, but there are gaping holes in the documentation. I'd most like
to know what I can get from the raw system call, libc 5, recent glibc,
and older glibc. For example, are file descriptors handled well?

Do you _know_ this? Off the top of my head I'd say the original process
will suffer minor page faults after the exec.

Since the POSIX version is so useless, you can just consider vfork() to
be a Linux-specific call. On a modern Linux system, one may depend on
quite a few things.
