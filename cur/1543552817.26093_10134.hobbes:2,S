Thanks for sending me this.
This problem that you are addressing is caused when solaris sends a
zero length write (I assume to implement the "access" system call, but
I haven't checked).
If you look at the code at the top of nfsd_write in nfsd/vfs.c, you
will see that if cnt (the number of bytes to write) is zero, then it
jumps straight out without setting an error or initialising fhp (by
calling nfsd_open).
As there is no error, nfsd tried to return status information (hence
the call the nfssvc_encode_attrstat) but doesn't have a valid file
handle.  So it Oopses.
The correct fix, which is in 2.4 and would have recently gone into the
2.2.18 pre-patches (but I haven't actually looked at them) is to move 
the test for (!cnt) to after the call to nfsd_open.
