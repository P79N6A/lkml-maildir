How about if "proper power management" is defined to include the driver 
explicitly preventing suspend? It seems to me like the current problem is 
that driver writers don't think about power management at all, and the 
result is that, after suspend/resume, the system doesn't come back. It 
would be better if driver writers had to think about power management just 
enough to realize that it's not going to work, and make this information 
available to the system. At that point, it's relatively easy for the 
system to do something useful about it.

It'd be relatively quick to modify all the current drivers that don't 
explicitly support suspend/resume to explicitly not support it. (Or to 
explicitly support it trivially; /dev/null obviously doesn't need 
anything.)
