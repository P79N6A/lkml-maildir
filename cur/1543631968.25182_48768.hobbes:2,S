That happens even on a "PeeCee". 
Situation: 
   - Normal readl() of a ioremap()ed register set of a
     PCI device[1]:
   -> machine hangs hard (no magic sysrq possible, no Ooops, no
      panic printed) 
   - Several DWORD reads of the same register set succeded before
     and the register is wired according to the SPEC.
Just to provide an argument here
PS: I wish I had an PCI Analyzer available...
[1] TI TMS320C6x EVM Board[2], Rev. 3 
   with PCI-Bridge Chip AMCC S5933[3] hanging the host side on Busmaster DMA.
[2] PCI-ID: 0x104c:0x1002
[3] PCI-ID: 0x10e8:0x4750 or 0x10e8:0x807d or 0x10e8:0x809c
