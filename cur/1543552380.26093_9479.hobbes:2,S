OK, but my current syslogd only listens to /dev/log as a SOCK_DGRAM.
If I wanted reliable syslogging, it would be listening on it as a
SOCK_STREAM.  Maybe I care more about performance and backwards
compatibility than reliable syslogging.  But whatever my reasons, my
connection to syslogd is already unreliable and therefore *should not
block*.
(Could a syslogd listen on /dev/log both as SOCK_DGRAM and as
SOCK_STREAM?  If so, then your philosophy implies that glibc should be
trying SOCK_STREAM *first*, falling back to SOCK_DGRAM for historical
compatibility.  Either way, when it uses datagrams, it should never
block, period.)
