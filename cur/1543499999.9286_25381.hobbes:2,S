Everything was cleaned with "make clean" and rebuilt
with the correct System.map installed this last time around
and I still got the buffer.c complaint.
Also, the swap had problems turning off this time and I had
to hit the reset key.
This bug is quite nasty.
I also get alot of thrashing the makes the machine unusable 
and happens even with the swap turned off.
What's up ?
