(Using the format from REPORTING-BUGS...)
[1.] compiler warning from cryptic pointer math
[2.] This change simplifies a cryptic macro in fs/readdir.c.  Rather
than subtracting an uninitialized pointer's d_name field address from
the uninitialized pointer base to get the field offset, we just use the
normal "offsetof" idiom to directly get the d_name field address from a
pointer to zero.  We can't use offsetof directly since the variable type
we have handy is a pointer, not the structure type itself.
(Our compiler is a gcc-alike that can figure out that it doesn't need to 
warn about things like "foo - foo" for an uninitialized pointer foo, but 
the field reference makes it think the pointer is truly being used; the 
warning made me look more closely at this piece of code.)
[4.] The kernel version is 2.6.17.1.
[X.]
