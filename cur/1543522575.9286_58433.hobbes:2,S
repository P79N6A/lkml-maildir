Good reason. The only thing i have to object to it is that there are so
many developers now (and many of them organized as indipendent teams)
that only a small number of them fit the 'Gee! There's a new kernel
to play with!' model. And there are more companies commercially
supporting Linux today than there were a couple of year ago (at 2.0 time).
THEY won't stop supporting a certain feature only bacause there's a new
kernel to play with, i think...

It's that 'making it somewhat more inconvenient to develop new stuff' that
I'm pointing out! I agree it was better to do that at 2.0 times, but
I'm wondering if that makes us pay today more that it gives!

I happended to agree years ago. I'm not sure now. Maintaining a big project
knowing that it touches some kernel internals as a separate branch against
a stable kernel, without a main devel branch to refer to (for months) can 
be expensive, in terms of finding yourself releasing on the old kernel
instead of the new one, or having to do a lot of work to port to the
new kernel (or both). I'd like to hear from the ReiserFS team if they
think that's what happened to them (it's what i suspect, but i really don't
know and can't tell...).

I don't know much of Debian, so I can't comment on this. I just say
that you can have a long freeze-to-release time and at the same time
a short release-to-release time, which is what really matters. I don't
know if that's what Debian people have (or aim to have). Having more
than two active branch (say three: one STABLE, one DEVEL-TO-STABLE,
one WILD-DEVEL) can give you LONG freeze-to-release and yet short
release-to-release time. I don't think it fits the Linux kernel development
process, since the former relays on changes being "regular" in time and size.
In kernel land, even a small change in the (kernel to kernel) API may
break a lot, while a complete rewriting that maintains the API intact
can be carried on with no impact on other kernel parts (this is important
because there are usually many-to-one relationships, just like the FSes to
VM one). So you can't really plan kernel changes in advace. We can't plan
2.7 changes now... I think we need just two branches. Anytime. Right
now the devel one disappears for months.

Thank you for pointing out what exacly the problem is. It's all in the
'making it somewhat more inconvenient to develop new stuff'. I think we
should change it, to allow easier serious development at any time.
Of course I know that's Linus' choice. I'm just making out arguments, not
asking him to do that tomorrow...
