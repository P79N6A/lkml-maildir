I sort of see the point. But I think it is indeed unfortunate that we
have all these events scattered throughout. I could live with the
current approach abusing the alsa mixer API, but there's little point in
making that element user-visible. So maybe I just need some new alsa
definitions here.
Although, come to think of it, a daemon keeping the mixer open blocks
unloading the module. I suppose I'd rather have it the other way around
like the eventdev system does -- the device goes away and all reads to
it fail.
