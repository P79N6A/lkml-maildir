Just to check: I got exactly the same thing, and a very similar oops (EIP in 
kmem_cache_grow &c) when trying to load sb.o & opl3.o under 2.4.7-pre5. It 
was caused by the fact that I hadn't updated /etc/modules.conf to point to 
the correct directory, and the kernel was trying to load modules from 2.4.5. 
Can you check to make sure that the modules being loaded are the correct ones 
for the kernel version?
cheers
john
