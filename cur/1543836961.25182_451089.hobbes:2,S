It is an accounting issue.  What I meant by re-sizing is there is no
change to node_mem_map (with reserve CONFIG_FLAT_NODE_MEM_MAP is set).
When the original size for the zone is setup it views that add areas as
a "hole" in the e820 space. 
See arch/x86_64/mm/init.c size_zones.

I know of no x86_64 hardware the supports empty node hot-add memory.  If
it exists I would recommend using SPARSEMEM based hot-add.  On HW I am
aware of there is always some memory present in a node at boot.
