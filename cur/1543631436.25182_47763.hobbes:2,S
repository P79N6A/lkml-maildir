It would be good to have some input from VIA on this, but I
can not find any errata on this (or anything else for that
matter-- they must make perfect chips :).
If you have an SMP box, there are other timers (in the APIC)
that generate interrupts, but, of course, most do not have
SMP boxen.  The ONLY thing in a UP box that generates a
stream of interrupts with out being acknowledged is the
PIT.  This is why it drives the NMI stuff in SMP boxes, for
example.  There are other watchdogs, but I think they
require special hardware.
On the other hand, WHY does the box need to be busy for this
to fail?  From the timer point of view, exactly what is
busy?  I wonder if it is a voltage sag or some such.
