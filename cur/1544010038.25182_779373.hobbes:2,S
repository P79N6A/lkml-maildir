I don't know what the problem of adding platform_drivers is. I just thought
it's a reasonable solution after looking at the drivers next to it.

That looks like it could work. (Well, I didn't even compile the code.)
However, i'd like to note:
1. props.flags and ops->flags is somewhat confusing. i had to read several
   times to see the difference. what about calling props.flags props.state?
   what it actually is.
2. props.power, props.fb_blank, and the newly props.flags looks quite confusing
   to me. what is it all used for? they are all about the current state?
3. Right now it's possible to add code specific for the resume process, e.g.,
   to circumvent hardware bugs. after applying your patch the drivers won't
   see a difference to normal updates anymore, due to backlight_resume clearing
   the BL_CORE_SUSPENDED flag before calling backlight_update_status, and there's
   no 'resume in progress' flag. i wouldn't need it anyway, but maybe someone else.
What about the remaining patches for 5th gen models support? They are against
the last patch. Am I supposed to send them now? Or wait and adapt them to your
patch once it's in Linus's tree (the one I cloned).
ciao,
Mario
