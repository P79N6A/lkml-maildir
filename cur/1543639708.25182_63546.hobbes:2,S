I don't see this as a big problem.  Most people don't use the bare
Configure script anyway, except for 'make oldconfig'.
With the ! patch, Menuconfig does the right thing here.

Simpler and perhaps more intuitive:
tristate DRV
dep_mbool DRV_OLD DRV
dep_mbool COMMON_OPT DRV
dep_mbool OLD_OPT1 DRV_OLD
dep_mbool OLD_OPT2 DRV_OLD
dep_mbool NEW_OPT1 DRV !DRV_OLD
dep_mbool NEW_OPT2 DRV !DRV_OLD
I don't see a real need for a separate symbol announcing DRV_NEW.  Let
the Makefile cope.
