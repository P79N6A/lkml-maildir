I dont take the mail list dist just answer here in and i will see the
answer.
The problem:
I thought
echo "scsi log all" >/proc/scsi/scsi 
with
scsi_logging=y  in .config
would turn on kernel scsi logging and put some notification line
in /var/log/messages
indicating scsi logging was now active at such and such a level
that is not happening and I have a external drive connected via
usb talking scsi that cannot be unmounted and i need to trace
scsi action so I can post here.
lsscsi output is
[0:0:0:0]    disk    USB 2.0  Storage Device   0100  /dev/sda
[1:0:0:0]    disk    Linux    scsi_debug       0004  /dev/sdb
any help would be appreciated.
thanks
jt
