Ok, right now the kernel _has_ a virtual mapping, it's just a 1:1 with the 
physical mapping, right?
In theory, if you restrict all kernel unmovable mappings to a physically 
contiguous address range (something like ZONE_DMA) that's at the start of the 
physical address space, then what you could do is have a two-kernel-monte 
like situation where if you _NEED_ to move the kernel you quiesce the system 
(as if you're going to swsusp), figure out where the new start of physical 
memory will be when this bank goes bye-bye, memcpy the whole mess to the new 
location, adjust your one VMA, and then call the swsusp unfreeze stuff.
This is ugly, and a huge latency spike, but why wouldn't it work?  The problem 
now becomes finding some NEW physically contiguous range to shoehorn the 
kernel into, and that's a problem that Mel's already addressing...
