I know that SCIos (
http://sci-serv.inrialpes.fr/
) does something like
this: They use SCI networks to do distributed shared memory in a
cluster. Then, if a node in the cluster wants to swap, it first checks if
there are free memory in the distributed shared memory. If there is, it
swaps to these pages. AFAIK they have found that it is quite a bit faster
then disk. The SCI controllers are on the PCI bus, but the memory is main
memory of a remote node. This means that they will have to travel 2 pci
busses, the network and the main memory bus of the remote node. Only going
through the local pci bus should be quite fast compared to this. (Slow
compared to main memory, yes).
SCIos is based on Linux (is a set of patches) - maybe there are some code
in there that could inspire someone.

If a man says something in a forest and there are no women around to
hear him, is he still wrong?
