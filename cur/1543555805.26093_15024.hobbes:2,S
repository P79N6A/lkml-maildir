You can have more than one console device. Only the primary device needs
to be present at boot time. Actually, I'm not sure even that has to be
present.
Since I added unregister_console() a long time ago, you can dynamically
add and remove console devices.

Not change. Add a new one. console != preferred_console.
And in this case, it's exactly what you want.  You don't want all the
normal bootup cruft, you want to load the driver after the boot is
finished, and only catch oopsen.
