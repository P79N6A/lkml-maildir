If half of memory is allocated for task structures, we won't
even be able to allocate the minimum number of page table
pages needed for each task ...
For a "normal" task we'll need at least 1 page directory and
3 page table pages. We only have space for half when the
maximum number of task_struct's is allocated.
Maybe it would be good to lower the default threads-max to
about 10% or less of physical memory ?

Rik
