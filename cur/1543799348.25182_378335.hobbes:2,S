A good ntpd will adjust the speed rather than write to the clock; the
ntpd shipped by most distributions can already handle multiple time sources.
I'm thinking of the case where a computer is not attached to a network
but needs accurate tim; in this case I'd give it a battery powered RTC
and a time signal receiver. As most time signals are low-bandwidth, they
may not carry full time information in each tick so it may take several
minutes to fully synchronize. In this case I'd like to use the battery
backed up clock first and switch later on when synchronized.

/dev is the way to go IMO. As far as I've understood sysfs, it carries
meta information about devices and drivers only, the actual
communication then happens through device nodes still.

That's entirely a userspace thing. What the userspace needs to know from
the kernel is whether the clock is writable and whether its speed can be
adjusted.

-EIO or -ENOSYS would also be possible options.
