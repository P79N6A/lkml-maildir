This may be a novice question...
I am trying to use the bttv module in 2.2.10-ac9.
The Documentation says to modify CARD and TUNER in driver/Makefile and
recompile.
What exactly am I suposed to modify in the Makefile. I don't see any place
to insert compiler defines, also am I supposed to change CARD or
CARD_DEFAULT ?
Thanx
Neal Katz
