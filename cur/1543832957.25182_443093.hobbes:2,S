it's a standalone patch. It can be dropped. I think there is some value to
it as we already agree

and there are also the netlink sockets mq_notify.
OK, so we agree that ipc namespaces cannot be unshared without extra
checks. I like the firewall approach : it's not safe, don't allow it. Which
is what the patch is doing : we can't unshare ipc namespace safely so let's
just forbid it :
	if (unshare_flags & CLONE_NEWIPC)
		goto bad_unshare_out;
simple, nop ? :)

what do you mean ? fs namespace doesn't change bc you need it to load the
new process image/interpreter.
