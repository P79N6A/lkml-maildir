Subject: 2.2.0pre4 goes nuts!

I've been using 2.1.xxx all along, with no big problems.  Today I
installed 2.2.0pre4 on i686-pc-linux-gnu, using egcs-2.91.60.  When I
fired up processes on a remote, using this machine heavily as an NFS
server, suddenly this system went nuts.  Disk activity was extremely
heavy.  Even Alt-ctrl-del wouldn't respond within the several minutes
I waited.
No log messages.  The only thing I saw was this on the console:
libc.so.6: cannot map zero-fill pages
This is very troubling, since I never saw this sort of problem with
2.1.130, for example.
