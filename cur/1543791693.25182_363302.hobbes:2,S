Aren't HPC users very easy? In fact, probably the easiest because they
generally not very kernel intensive (apart from perhaps some batches of
IO at the beginning and end of the jobs).
A reclaimable zone should provide exactly what they need. I assume the
sysadmin can give some reasonable upper and lower estimates of the
memory requirements.
They don't need to dynamically resize the pool because it is all being
allocated to pagecache anyway, so all jobs are satisfied from the
reclaimable zone.
