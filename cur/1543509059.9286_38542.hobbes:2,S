Here are two small fixes for Linux kernel 2.3.18:
* The patch 2.3.10->2.3.11 added a return statement to the F0 0F
  bug workaround code which disabled the workaround. (I assume
  this was intended as a temporary fix while ironing out other
  changes.) The patch below re-enables the F0 0F workaround.
* parport_pc has one "virtual" bug and one real one:
  * After placing the ECP port in configuration mode, the config
    status should be read from I/O port CONFIGA(pb), not FIFO(pb).
    [They denote the same I/O address, but that address changes
    meaning depending on the mode of the parallel port.]
  * The ISA-Level/Pulses bit (0x80) should be read from CONFIGA(pb),
    not CONFIGB(pb). (0x80 in CONFIGB is the "compress" flag.)
  While I'm at it: the check for IRQ conflict further down fails
  on my Dell Latitude notebook: On the Latitude, CONFIGB always
  reads as zero, which makes parport_pc believe there's an IRQ
  conflict (there isn't). parport_pc then turns off IRQ capability,
  which leaves the parport in a next to useless state (printing
  is excruciatingly slow, if it works at all). I know some documents
  recommend this check; I'm just not sure whether they're wrong
  or whether the Dell Latitude has a crap parallel port controller.
  Printing works in polling mode and IRQ-mode without FIFO/DMA.
