And like that wouldn't be enough once you start using sysenter all the
other seemingly minor details start to bite you (like it looses not only
VM but also the IF flag. so now every syscall turns on interrupts...
I guess i'll have to declare that a feature :) )

I am not convinced doing the magic entry point will be a win; i 
certainly agree with Ulrich that the libc solution is more attractive.
But we'll get the global fixmapped region anyway, so there's a chance
we will be able to compare both.

hmm, rdtsc based gettimeofday?

i did look after the first time you mentioned it.
i'll try playing with that.

No, it does not. I haven't even written the code handling that case, for
the very simple reason i haven't yet figured out _what_ to do when a
vm86 task executes SYSENTER. This is one of only two unresolved issues
left. As it is impossible to recover from this (w/o a cooperative
userspace, that is. sysenter drops eip/esp/cs/ss) what should happen?
[i don't use any vm86 tasks so i'd find it acceptable to simply _exit(),
 but there might be a better way... Ideas?]
Oh, there's something else i have on the todo list, but haven't yet
looked into -- SYSENTER doesn't clear TF.
