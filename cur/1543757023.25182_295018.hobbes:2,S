the wrong thing is that if I change the size of the guard page in
vmalloc.c, the arch code will break. the guard page is a debugging knob,
people may want to remove it someday to save virtual address space, and
they shouldn't be required to look after N architectures.
Plus people will keep forgetting that p->size has the guard page
included if you don't fix it the right way, x86-64 and x86 have been
corrupting the pageattr of the next physical pages because of that for a
long time.
Plus if you applied the best fix in vmalloc.c, you wouldn't even need to
touch x86 and x86-64 arch dependent code, you could call
change_page_attr on p->size without having to do -PAGE_SIZE.
At least you should define a VMALLOC_GUARD_PAGE_SIZE, or something,
the hardcoding of p->size-PAGE_SIZE looks wrong to me.
