My disks connected to a hpt374 controller are a lot slower in linux
2.5.67 than 2.4.21-pre5.  Under 2.4 I get ~40 MB/s (as expected), but
with 2.5.67 the rates drop to ~30 MB/s.
The system is an Alpha SX164.  Disks are one Western Digital WD880BB,
and one Seagate Barracuda V 120GB.
Is there any explanation, or (better) fix, for this degradation?
