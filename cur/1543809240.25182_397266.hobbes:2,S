I take it daemonize() does not now need to be called because the new process
derives from keventd.
You've also broken things... The waitqueue is there for a specific reason:
namely so that I can have multiple threads.
Actually, RxRPC and AFS should be made to use rpciod, except that Trond hasn't
got around to documenting it yet.

That should be rxrpc_krxiod_thread.

Don't assign an error to (rxrpc_)krxiod_thread.

Ditto on name.

Ditto on assignment of error.

Ditto on name (I'd got this one wrong too).
