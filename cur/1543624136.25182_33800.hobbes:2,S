	[PATCH] smbfs nls oops fix
	Fixes smbfs oopsing on failed nls translations and maps unknown
chars to
	:#### strings. Also PATHLEN vs NAMELEN mixups.
Hi, apparently my smbfs mounts have had failed nls translations, but I
didn't know it -- never saw any warnings. So when I upgraded to 2.5.6 that
included this patch, the filenames on my samba mounts all turned into
"x00:x00..." etc. ;-)
Turning off CONFIG_SMB_NLS_DEFAULT produces a different, but still failing,
result.
How can I get samba working again? What am I doing wrong? And, why is samba
so stingy with the error messages in this case?
Thanks -- Regards -- Andy
