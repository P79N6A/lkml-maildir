Which is somewaht funny.
source is defined like this:
"source" <prompt>
Where <prompt> may be a single string without spaces or
a quoted string with spaces.
So kconfig allow you to use spaces in the path/filename. But
then most users uses "" despite it is not needed since we obviously
do not use spaces in path/filename in the kernel due to
make limitations (and good taste).
