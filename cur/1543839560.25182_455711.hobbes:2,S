How is execve() supposed to use the local errno? The kernel syscall
macro only "creates" a function, so you still need a global errno for
that code, don't you?
And I (because I'm clueless ;) wonder about the calls to set_fs(), why
do we need them? The current code does not seem to do them. Or is there
something special about kernel_execve that I'm missing? cscope and grep
didn't tell anything and Google had only a few useless results for
kernel_execve.
