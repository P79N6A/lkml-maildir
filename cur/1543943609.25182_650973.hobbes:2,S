Ok good.

So it magically becomes a derived work if I do a:
#define malloc(n) kmalloc(n, 0)
#define pthread_mutex_lock(l) spin_lock(l)
at the beginning of the file?  My guess is that it is much to trivial
to be considered a creative expression and thus would not be covered by
copyright.  Meaning it would not be a derivative work.

A device driver isn't that hard either.  I can write a device driver
with a hand tied behind my back, to write a good balancing tree, I'd
have to spend a lot more time reading up on algorithms.  So "trivial" is
a matter of background.
And once again, I don't believe API copyrights are valid, because in
that case Wine would have been sued out of the water a long time ago.

*sigh* Now you're just being insulting.
