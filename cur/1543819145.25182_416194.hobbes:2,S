One year has passed since I sent this patch the first time, and with the 
exception that it needs re-diff'ing it still applies.
Charles, are the changes you are talking about that might need them 
available in the very near future?
If not, I'd suggest to remove them and re-add them when code using them 
will be included in the kernel (reverting parts or all of my patch 
should be trivial).
This way, they'll not continue to uselessly making the kernel image 
larger.
