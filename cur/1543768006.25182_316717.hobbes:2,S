	As does 2.6.12-rc4.  The unusual 1K block size I used for this reiserfs
seems to have exposed the problem; all my other reiserfs use 4K and have
no problem.  I copied its contents to a new reiserfs I created with 4K
blocks and the later kernels work fine with the copy.  I also tried
turning off CONFIG_QUOTA on 2.6.12-rc4 - that worked with the 1K block
reiserfs as well.  I'm keeping the 4K block copy, since that works with
QUOTA, and turning QUOTA off affects non-reiserfs fs as well.
	Note also:
- The 1K block fs caused the problem even though no quota mount options
were set.
- All my reiserfs are devmapped, so I don't know if the problem occurs
without it on a physical partition, or whether the symptoms would
differ.
	HTH,
