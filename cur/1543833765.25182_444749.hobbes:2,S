This would be even less usable, there is no requirement that NTP is used 
for time synchronization and the kernel has no idea when then the next 
NTP adjustment happens.

This is true for the clock source, but the adjustments that come in via 
NTP are not exactly linear, so unless you want to rewrite the whole NTP 
system, I don't think this will work.

Thomas, do you have any idea how insulting this is?
First of all you are pretty much wrong with your analysis. It does not 
rely on "periodic precise event", it helps if they are precise, but it's 
not a requirement and it's practically a one line change so it can deal 
with nonperiodic updates (the rest is just a matter of correct tuning). 
The "fine grained adjustment" doesn't "compensate for the inaccuracy of 
the scaled math" at all, one has to know here that we only have to be 
accurate within limits (usually the resolution of the clock), so that the 
inaccuracy is not really a problem and it has the advantage that is 
generally cheap. What the adjustments actually compensate for is the 
difference in resolution and the update delays.
Since your initial analysis is pretty much wrong, your conclusions are 
pretty much useless as well. So far so bad, by itself this wouldn't be 
really a problem yet, everyone makes mistakes. If you would at least ask 
some questions about whatever problem you'd like to see solved or if you 
would make some constructive suggestion how to solve these problems, this 
would have shown respect and could have been a nice discussion. Instead 
you just piss on my work by asking John to throw away everything I did and 
to "solve" it somehow.
Did you even consider for a second that I might have already thought about 
these problems? Did it enter your mind that the hard problems might 
already be pretty much solved? Since you don't ask me at all, you don't 
really seem to care about what I think. Instead of playing Mr. 
know-it-all, I would really appreciate it if you showed some more respect 
for my work.
bye, Roman
