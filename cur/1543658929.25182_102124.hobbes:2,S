Here I get e.g.
drivers/built-in.o: In function `isdn_audio_put_dle_code':
drivers/built-in.o(.text+0xe2247): undefined reference to `save_flags'
drivers/built-in.o(.text+0xe224c): undefined reference to `cli'
drivers/built-in.o(.text+0xe226f): undefined reference to `restore_flags'
which is actually correct. My ld doesn't output the name of the file the 
function was in at all, though. I'm rather sure that you're hitting a 
binutils bug, possibly triggered by the use of the ld during the kernel 
build, which creates multiple levels of composite objects (ld -r) before 
the final link.
Maybe you updated binutils and that's when the problems started?
