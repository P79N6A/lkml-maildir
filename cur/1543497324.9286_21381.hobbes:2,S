Thats error is because depmod -a is not being called to create
/lib/modules/$version/modules.dep which has nothing to do with a kernel
compile.
Either stop kerneld or kmod from being started at bootime or make sure
depmod -a is called from one of the rc scripts at bootime, that will
eliminate the error message, its not realy an error but a warning and
therefor could be ignored when not using modules.
