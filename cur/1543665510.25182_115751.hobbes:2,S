Change the wording any way you like, my point that the drive is more
likely to have correct information about its LBA capacity than the BIOS.

So you are saying the same thing I am, are you not? I said to use the
drive LBA capacity, you say that means nothing and then agree that is
exactly what the drive can tell us. Many people put new drives in old
machines which have a BIOS which doesn't understand large drives. So the
kernel should believe the drive about the size rather than the BIOS.
You call that nonsens and then say the same thing in other words as if you
were disagreeing with me.
