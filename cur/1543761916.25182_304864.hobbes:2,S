Impressive, and my name isn't even Hugh.
Question, Dave: flush_tlb_pgtables after Hugh's patch is also
possibly not being called with enough range to cover all page
tables that have been freed.
For example, you may have a single page (start,end) address range
to free, but if this is enclosed by a large enough (floor,ceiling)
then it may free an entire pgd entry.
I assume the intention of the API would be to provide the full
pgd width in that case?
