If this reluctance to munch cache can be relaxed a little, I think
we'll see the end of a long standing problem.  I often see a scenario
wherein we flush everything flushable, then steal the entire cache
before doing any paging.  The result (we hit a wall) is a mondo swapout
followed immediately by swapping it all right back in.  We seem to have
done a complete turnaround wrt paging vs flush/cache reap preference,
and that does effectively cure this scenario.. but methinks optimal
(-ENOENT?) lies somewhere in between.

I'll watch behavior under other loads.  (I don't have enough network
capacity to do anything stressful there, and whatever load I pick
has to be compute bound as to not end up benchmarking my modest I/O
capacity.. suggestions welcome.  I use make -j primarily because it
doesn't need much I/O bandwidth for itself, but does allocate quite
a bit.. that leaves most I/O capacity free for vm usage)
Something else I see while watching it run:  MUCH more swapout than
swapin.  Does that mean we're sending pages to swap only to find out
that we never need them again?
