Subject: Re: [PATCH 1/4] create mm/Kconfig for arch-independent memory options

Hi Roman,
How does the attached patch look?  It will still give us the flexibility
to override the memory models, but only in the presence of
CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL.
It also adds some better help text to the DISCONTIGMEM menu.  Is that
something like what you were looking  for?
