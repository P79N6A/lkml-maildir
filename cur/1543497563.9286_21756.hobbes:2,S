Not everyone uses module. I hate my notebook not be able to work
without modules.

Yes. Last time I saw database was not that big, and if every driver
carries list of cards it can handle with it (like it currently does
for PCI), I see nothing wrong.
I could do things like have floppy with kernel only (it is _very_ easy
to put kernel on floppy, but it is pretty hard to create working
initrd) and then use nfsroot, or have floppy with kernel only and then
boot from cdrom, or... And instalation would not take two days...
