Aha.  Excellent.

I think you actually do have an 8363, and so some sort of fix is
probably needed.

I think your system does need the fix, but only bit 7 needs clearing.
Not all of it.  If memory serves me, clearing bit 7 was the
experimentally-determined fix for the bug, however, VIA said that all 3
bit needed clearing.  Perhaps this should be looked into, as I
experienced the same screen corruption bug on the same chipset.  I have
yet to try my own proposed fix on it, however :-/
I'll do this within the next week or so, and if it works for me, I'll
propose a patch to only clear bit 7, at least on these chips.  Sound
good to you?
