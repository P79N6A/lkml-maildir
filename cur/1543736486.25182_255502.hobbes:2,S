I just realized that I was using an old kernel tree (2.6.7 with
some patches), which might be the reason for getting fewer results
(38 of my 175 findings were extra #include lines, not missing ones).
Running my script against the linux.bkbits.net tree gives now gives
me 178 missing and 35 extraneous inclusions of workqueue.h, so your
list is probably exact if you are grepping against -mm.
