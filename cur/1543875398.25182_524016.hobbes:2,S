Yes it is.

I don't know precisely which commit you are talking about, but I
upgraded to 2.6.21-rc5, and the problem became more obvious.
From what I experimented, I came to the conclusion that when the
frequency of the first CPU is wrongly detected, the timers get wrong
(i.e. tsc, hpet, with or without high-res timers).
It is not a new bug, it happened in 2.6.20 too (I also found an old
dmesg from 2.6.18-rc2 with the same frequency detection problem), except
that for some reasons it didn't cause that many obvious bugs, so I
didn't notice it at that time.
(in case you don't remember my first message, I have a Macbook Pro first
generation (Core Duo, so x86), see below for /proc/cpuinfo)
This is the diff of two consecutive soft reboots, with the same kernel
(CONFIG_HPET_TIMER unset, CONFIG_HIGH_RES_TIMERS set):

The "+" boot reports the correct CPU frequency (1.83Ghz).
When you run something like this on both:
# ntpdate swisstime.ethz.ch
# ntpdate swisstime.ethz.ch
# sleep 60
# ntpdate swisstime.ethz.ch
You get, with the "+" boot, what you expect:
26 Mar 16:33:34 ntpdate[3385]: adjust time server 129.132.2.21 offset 0.120391 sec
26 Mar 16:32:52 ntpdate[3376]: adjust time server 129.132.2.21 offset 0.137979 sec
-- pause of about 60 seconds
26 Mar 16:33:55 ntpdate[3386]: adjust time server 129.132.2.21 offset 0.125751 sec
i.e. the clock is still correct 60 seconds after you adjust it.
While, with the "-" boot, you get:
26 Mar 16:18:05 ntpdate[3444]: step time server 129.132.2.21 offset 3.829351 sec
26 Mar 16:18:08 ntpdate[3445]: adjust time server 129.132.2.21 offset 0.232023 sec
-- pause
26 Mar 16:19:16 ntpdate[3447]: step time server 129.132.2.21 offset 4.320653 sec
The clock has shifted of about 4.1 seconds in 60 seconds, i.e. an error
of 6.8%, which is in the same range as the error between 1952 and 1833
Mhz (6.5%).
I get the same results with both CONFIG_HPET_TIMER and
CONFIG_HIGH_RES_TIMERS unset, some boots are ok, some aren't.
I couldn't get a correct boot with these two options enabled, but it's
probably because I didn't reboot enough times...
I you want some detailed kernel logs, see
http://www.boichat.ch/nicolas/linux/2nd/
 .
Please tell me if you need more informations, or if you prefer I file a
bug in the bugzilla.
Best regards,
Nicolas
