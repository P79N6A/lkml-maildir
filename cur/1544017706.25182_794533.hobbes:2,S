to use netconsole you probably need to set config option
CONFIG_FIRMWARE_IN_KERNEL=y
Hm, I wonder if we couldn't have netconsole=y select
CONFIG_FIRMWARE_IN_KERNEL in Kconfig
the arguments as to why the firmware was split out of the drivers have
already been made on this list.  Not that I agree with them, but the
decision has been made and we're (network devs) going along with it.
