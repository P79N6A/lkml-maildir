I tested this change applied to usb-ohci.
I did not fix the problem where eth0 spits
out a ton of error messages:
eth0: Host error, FIFO diagnostic register 0000.
eth0: using default media MII
eth0: Host error, FIFO diagnostic register 0000.
eth0: using default media MII
eth0: Too much work in interrupt, status e003.
eth0: Host error, FIFO diagnostic register 0000.
eth0: using default media MII
This error occurs when I am trasfering data over my
DSL connection while moving my USB mouse.
