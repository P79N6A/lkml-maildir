I built kernel 2.6.15-rc6 with gcc-4.0 , and I built ivtv 0.5
 svn r3019 ( 
http://www.ivtvdriver.org/
 ).
When loading ivtv module with firmware (placed at /lib/firmware ),
it seems to succeeed,but not was loaded to device 
(Connexant CX23416 MPEG Encoder).
So, I tested kernel 2.6.15-rc5 and ivtv built with gcc-4.0, 
success to load  firmware correct.
And, I built 2.6.15-rc6 and ivtv with gcc-3.4 again,loading
firmware was successed.
Refered version of gcc was:
GCC 4.0 :
>gcc version 4.0.3 20051201 (prerelease) (Debian 4.0.2-5)
GCC 3.4 :
>gcc version 3.4.5 (Debian 3.4.5-1)
Pls.help....
