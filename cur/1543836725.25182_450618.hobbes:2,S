If such a bug persists with the latest released e2fsck version - you're
not showing e2fsck logs - I'm rather sure Ted Ts'o would like to have a
look at your file system meta data in order to teach e2fsck how to fix
this.
I've seen sufficient releases of reiserfsck that couldn't fix certain
bugs, too, so trying with the latest version of the respective tools is
a must.
