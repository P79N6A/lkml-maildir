Do other modules compile/insmod OK?  If they do, as Keith says, you need to
check how you're compiling.  If not, this could be the same as the weird
problem I had once, caused by not having (at the root cause), /etc/localtime
set correctly.  This caused 'date' to output a string far longer than normal,
which in turn caused UTS_VERSION in include/linux/compile.h to be too long,
which, in its turn, caused module versions not to get set correctly, resulting
in this message.  An easy way to check for this would be to try 'uname -a'.
If it gives something like:
Linux bespin 2.2.14 #5 SMP Mon Jan 17 17:29:03 GMT 2000 i686 unknown
then I've wasted your time :-(  If it gives
Linux bespin 2.2.14 #5 SMP Mon Jan 17 17:29:03 <rubbish from here on>
then this is the problem.
I'm guessing there should really be a check made at compile-time for this
problem.
