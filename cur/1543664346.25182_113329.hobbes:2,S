For a while now, I've been trying to figure out how
to make the oom killer not kill important processes.
How about rewarding processes that have an
RSS limit if they stay well below it?
The operator can then mark processes that are important
by using 'ulimit -m'.
(This is orthogonal to Rik's recent patch.)
