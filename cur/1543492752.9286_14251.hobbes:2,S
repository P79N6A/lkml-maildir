There is _one_ program on the system which can do that, and that program is
heavily guarded, can be run (just group execute bit, immutable, ...) by
only a very select group of people (perhaps only if the kernel is in a
special "unsecure" mode), logs everything it does to a different machine
that is totally out of the hands of the granters.
Capabilities aren't attached to users, but to individual processes, so
there isn't a "whoever".

If I can somehow hijack a UID 0 process in your scheme, the system is mine
to keep. With real capabilities, I get nothing (or very little).
The above is terminal paranoia, to be sure. But capabilities and ACLs are
for people into that. Can be quite useful to us mere mortals too ;-)
