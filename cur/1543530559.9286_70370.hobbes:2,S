Hi,
I'm seeing the following messages on Linux 2.2.14 each time I mount
a floppy disk:
set_blocksize: b_count 1, dev fd(2,0), block 749!
set_blocksize: b_count 1, dev fd(2,0), block 863!
set_blocksize: b_count 2, dev fd(2,0), block 1066!
set_blocksize: b_count 1, dev fd(2,0), block 1431!
Previously, I have been using 'dd' and 'fdformat' many times to copy
disk images to/from disks (some disks had errors on them).  Is this a
known 2.2.14-ism?
PS, I am unlikely to be able to reproduce the problem (I have no plans to
repeat this exercise in the near future).
