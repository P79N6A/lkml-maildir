Hi, 
	I also thought about that,
	I think that the best solution is still to hide connect/disconnect of usb devices from userspace (now it also causes corruption)
	But to refuse suspend with any usb mass storage device connected with mounted systems (and add a module param override
	 for users who know what they are doing)
	What do you think ?
	Regards,
