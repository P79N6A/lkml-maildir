From NT's point of view, they are just similarly named files, joined at
the inode (i.e. common permissions, [acm]time etc). We can support this
under Linux as well, at least on NTFS, without any real silliness creeping
in - and the VFS needn't know anything about this (it will just see some
similar looking files). Renaming one component of such a file will break
this join; renaming the other components will reunite them. On ext2 etc.,
they are just normal files.
Nice, consistent behaviour across filesystems, no user-space breakage,
minimal user confusion... The only drawback I can see it that this isn't
quite how NT does it. That may not be a bad point for most ppl here :-)
