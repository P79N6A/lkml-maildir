Note to others:
If you are brave and pull down Jeff's libata-dev tree,
then it already has ATAPI DMA working (mostly) therein.
That's what I've done on my newest ICH6M machine here,
and both the PATA HD and PATA DVD-RW are working just fine
in "combined mode" using ata_piix.  After applying a bugfix
patch for ATAPI error handling (which Jeff has just posted
here today somewhere for general comments).
Cheers.
