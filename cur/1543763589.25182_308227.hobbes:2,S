Hi everybody,
I have several questions about ioremap:
1) I have two 16 bit sram memory devices. To force it works I had to use 
ioremap with memorysize*2, because
I was able to write to the 1 and 2 byte, 5,6, 9,10, 13,14 and so on.
Please explain why my ioremap space is non-continous,
how to ioremap a 32 bit device that consists of 2 16 bit devices? (in 
another system I simply copied the 16 bits to first device and another 
16 bits
to the second device and I had a working system) and why in the remapped 
memory are holes?
2) In my another system to get a value of the register from a flash 
device I had to use "volatile u16 the_address_of_my_device".
How to get the value in the case when Linux has virtual remapped the 
physical address?
Thank you.
