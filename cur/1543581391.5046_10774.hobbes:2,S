I've noticed that -ac9 comes with the "Disable PCI-Master-Read-Caching
on VIA" patch that Peter Horton posted a while back. I don't know
whether it was applied in Linus' or your tree first, but is it
actually verified to fix anything?
AFAIR Peter Horton later posted that it didn't fix a thing for him and
Petr Vandrovec tracked down his corruption issue to a Promise driver
problem. I see no corruption with Master-Read-Caching enabled here and
unless someone can verify that it really is the culprit, the patch
is probably completely redundant.
