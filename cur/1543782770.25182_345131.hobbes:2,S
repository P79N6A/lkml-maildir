You also must not use any syscall that allocates even temporary memory in 
kernel (select, poll, many others ...) or that waits on semaphore that 
might be held while allocating memory (i.e. audit and rewrite ide ioctl 
path).
And you need extra flags to protect the daemon from being killed at 
shutdown or blocked at suspend.
I think writing it as kernel thread would be easir than all this.

That makes the protection less reliable (you shake the notebook and after 
the timeout drop it).
