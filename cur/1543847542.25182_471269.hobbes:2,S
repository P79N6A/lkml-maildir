Hmmm.. Why not? If you can define fls on a per arch basis then that should 
be possible? You can tell the compiler to produce the correct version of 
the scan instructions. We do that frequently on IA64.

Undefined values are bad. Could you produce a runtime error instead?

With the appropriate per arch modification of fls() this should also be 
possible within the existing framework.
