There is no way of preventing authors from using "your" code once
you publish it. They just can't claim that they wrote it without
violating copyright law. Copyrights and Licensing are two different
independent things. See a Lawyer.
The attached 'C' program, when linked with any proprietary module,
will bypass all the  "EXPORT_GPL_ONLY" and similar "SCREW_YOU" macros.
To prevent using this or other similar work-arounds to road-blocks
thrown in the way of users, you would have to get GNU 'ld' to prevent
partial linking and make sure that all old copies have been destroyed.
This, by example, shows that "GPL Only" is unenforceable.  I suggest
that all the "GPL only" zealots try something new (like more good code),
rather than attempting to prevent honest workers from using code
they helped develop.
