I think you got a wrong understanding of the stack. The stack has no
separate bss, data, and text sections, it's just a stack of function
arguments, local variables, and return addresses.
Accessing the stack works automatically: call a function, and the
function paramaters and the return address are pushed on the stack.
Unless you have a *very* good reason, there is no need to manipulate
the stack directly in kernel mode.

  lists, use only one of them next time (kernelnewbies is good for this
  kind of questions).
