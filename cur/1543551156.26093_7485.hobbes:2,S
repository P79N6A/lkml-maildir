Hi,
Finally got around to trying out 2.4.0test9. I'm going to do some VM
performance comparisons (incidentally because VM should be a carefully
measured science not random cool idea of the day which we have seen too
much of recently).
Unfortunately, I can't start fair tests yet because UDMA3 refuses to
activate in 2.4.0test-9.
I get these messages on boot
ide0: Speed warnings UDMA 3/4/5 is not functional.
hda: dma_intr: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
hda: dma_intr: error=0x84 { DriveStatusError BadCRC }
hda: dma_intr: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
hda: dma_intr: error=0x84 { DriveStatusError BadCRC }
hda: dma_intr: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
hda: dma_intr: error=0x84 { DriveStatusError BadCRC }
hda: dma_intr: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
hda: dma_intr: error=0x84 { DriveStatusError BadCRC }
ide0: reset: success
hda: DMA disabled
Subsequently, if I run
hdparm -d1 -X67 /dev/hda
I get told
ide0: Speed warnings UDMA 3/4/5 is not functional.
And this leaves me with
/dev/hda:
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  5.71 seconds = 11.21 MB/sec
Under the stock 2.2 RedHat 7.0 kernel, the same hdparm tuning gives me
about 17Mb/s.
Anyone got any hints? I selected the ATA option. Might this be causing the
failure?
Anyone got any hints?
Cheers
Chris
