Linus, this is a followup git pull request for a single fix:
   git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/mingo/linux-2.6-sched.git
Frans Pop has tested a fix from Balbir Singh that (finally) resolves the 
procps CPU accounting bug. The fix you pulled earlier today was correct 
but it solved only half of the problem.
