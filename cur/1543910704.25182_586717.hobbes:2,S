it tells me something really important: that the virtual box's scheduler 
gave this task as much CPU time as it could.

the steal percentage is really a concept one step higher in the 
scheduling hierarchy. You should be running top (or an equivalent tool) 
in the _hypervisor_ context if you want to know about how much time each 
virtual box gets. 'mixing' that information with the 'internal' task 
statistics of the virtual box is less consistent IMO and leads to the 
loss of information. (with the 'mixing' method there's no way to tell 
whether a task got all CPU time it asked for - and _that_ is which an 
admin is interested in just as much as the time allocation between 
virtual boxes.)
so in say KVM you determine the steal percentage by looking at 'top' 
output in the hypervisor context. (or looking at steal% in the internal 
top output) Looking at 'top' in the guest tells you everything internal 
to that guest, without mixing external scheduling information into it.
