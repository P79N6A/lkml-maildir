Urk.  I'd forgotten entirely about color.  Some people are certainly
using tokens on surfaces, distinguishable either by shape or color. But
maybe that is better left outside of this until we have a more concrete
non-research system to grok before defining a kernel interface; many of
these systems may be doing advanced image processing in user space
processes and talking directly to X with the result rather than
via /dev/input....  Or do you feel you have good enough experience with
the MERL table and other systems to take a stab at it now?
