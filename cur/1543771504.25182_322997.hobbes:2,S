> Are those loopback allocations GFP_KERNEL?
It depends :-)  Most of the time, the packets will be
allocated at sendmsg() time for the user, and thus GFP_KERNEL.
But the flags may be different if, for example, the packet
is being allocated for the NFS client/server code, or some
asynchronous packet generated at software interrupt time
(TCP ACKs, ICMP replies, etc.).
