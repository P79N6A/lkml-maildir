I will fix the 3 problems you discovered in the current code.
And lets  compare the two results.  However you have more features in
your patch which will be the differentiating factor between the two
versions.
1. exponential increase and decrease of window size 
2. overlapped read of current window and readahead window.
3. fixed slow-read path.
4. anything else?
The readsize parameter comes in handy to incorporate the
the above features.
