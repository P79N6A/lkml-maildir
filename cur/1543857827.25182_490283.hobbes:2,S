Ingo,
	The psuedo-code you have provided can still fail to avoid
the deadlock reported by Bjorn Helgaas earlier in this thread:
	
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/12/6/352
Thread1->flush_workqueue->mutex_lock(cpu4's hotplug_lock)
Thread2(keventd)->run_workqueue->som_work_fn-> ..
		flush_workqueue->mutex_lock(cpu4's hotplug_lock)
Both deadlock with each other.
All this mess could easily be avoided if we implement a reference-count
based cpu_hotplug_lock(), as suggested by Arjan and Linus before and
implemented by Gautham here:
