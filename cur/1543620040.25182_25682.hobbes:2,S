undefined. If kmalloc slept and you survived (due to setting
TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE that's not guaranteed)  then it'll most likely be
TASK_RUNNING. 
If you depend on this your kernel code is broken in that has subtle
dependencies on unspecified behavior and will break whenever kmalloc changes
internal behavior.
