My brainstorming ways to accomodate the isolation that the scheduler,
allocator and resource manager domains require is getting ahead of
itself.
First I need to hear from the CKRM folks what degree of isolation they
really need, the essential minimum, and how they intend to accomodate
not just cpusets, but also the other placement API's sched_setaffinity,
mbind and set_mempolicy, as well as the per-cpu kernel threads.
Then it makes sense to revisit the implementation.
