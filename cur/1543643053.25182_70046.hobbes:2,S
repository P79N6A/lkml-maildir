Please correct me if I'm missing something: I tend to assume
that if the cost of the disk seek is known to be a relatively
huge value, a fraction of it could be used as a timeout for disk
read request reordering with performance not deteriorating (except
for the heuristics overhead of course). I.e., if some code in the
block layer were able to detect a lot of "parallel yet sequential"
reads were going on, the amount of seeks could be minimized for
the price of the final timeout.
