Well, it would be impossible or at least very hard to see that in
practice, right?  My understanding is that drives do sector-level
checksums, so if there was a partially written sector, the checksum
would be bogus and the drive would return an error when you tried to
read from it.

Yep, exactly.  It would be interesting to see if this happens on
modern hardware; all of the evidence I've had for this is years old at
this point.
