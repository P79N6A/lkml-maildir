True enough.  However, I hope you will agree that we should not
confuse foresight with speculation.
At present there is no sign on the horizon of either any mac80211
mesh code or any other full-MAC wireless driver supporting mesh.
Without either of those, it would seem imprudent to rush toward
a gneric configuration interface even if nl80211 was prepared to
sprout one.
John
P.S.  If someone wants to announce either mesh support for mac80211
or a driver for a new full-MAC device supporting mesh, I'm prepared
to be wrong! :-)
