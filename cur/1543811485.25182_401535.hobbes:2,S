Subject: [PATCH] Fix Specialix SX corruption
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

Roger,
With the latest kernels, I experienced some strange corruption, some
'*****' being randomly inserted in the character flow, like this:
ashes:~#
ashes:~#
a*******shes:~#

ashes:~#
Further investigation shows that the problem was introduced during
Alan's "TTY layer buffering revamp" patch, the amount of data to be
copied being reduced after buffer allocation. Moving the count fixup
around solves the problem.
Patch against v2.6.16-rc5.
