But then we miss out on all the good stuff happening in setup_arch since 
smp_processor_id() isn't set in cpu_online_map until smp_prepare_boot_cpu.  I 
can try upping it in arch code, but iirc, I had problems with that in older 
kernels due to the expectations of some of the other CPU upping code.  I'll 
give it a try again and either give you a good answer or send a more 
appropriate patch to David.
Thanks,
Jesse
