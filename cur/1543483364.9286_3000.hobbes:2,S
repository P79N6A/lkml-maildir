He does not have plans to do ANYTHING to help in kernel development. He think
that Linux is just pub where you could grab free beer "Linux" for free and
where a lot of peoples will help you for free while you'll not help anyone.

Now I'm remembering why I decided I was going to NEVER EVER develop
anything for the Linux kernel (at least nothing that I'm releasing
publicly...  I've done some neat magic w/ MP3 and the SB16 sound card as
well as 'midi-font' technology on same HW), and I think this will stay true
forever.

It's no matter how many years of programming expirience you have. It's no
matter if you are expert or novice in Linux. But stating that you are plan
to use any possible help from Linux community while not contributing back
is best way to get situation when noone will want to help you.
