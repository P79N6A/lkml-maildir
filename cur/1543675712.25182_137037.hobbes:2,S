   meaning just use spin_lock() or what?
Alan/Chas, there are two different issues here:
1) Aparently the bug only needs to be worked around when
   multiple cpus can access the card at the same time.
   Therefore on uniprocessor the bug isn't relevant.
2) Therefore, the lock needs to protect register accesses
   from all contexts.  Therefore he needs an IRQ protecting
   lock.
Therefore it isn't legal for him to use a non-IRQ protecting
spinlock.
I personally don't think it's worth all the maintainence cost
to special case all of this junk for uniprocessor.
