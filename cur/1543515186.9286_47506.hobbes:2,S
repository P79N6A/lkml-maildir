They subdivided into bytes that were anywhere from 1 to 36 bits wide,
depending on what you needed.  TOPS-10 used SIXBIT for filenames; TOPS-20
used ASCIZ strings (five bytes/word with the LSB unused).  Some tape
formats were buffered in 9-bit bytes.  PDP-11 based FEPs often exchanged
buffers of 8-bit bytes.  I think tht 36-bit word width stems from a
decision to use existing 18-bit memory boards in the PDP-6.  The original
design used 18-bit addresses.
IIRC people are still building PDP-10 clones, so this is not quite as OT
as you might think -- somebody might want to port Linux to 'em someday.
(Usually the layering goes the other way:  there's a PDP-10 emulator that
runs on Linux. :-)

Please, no more software products offering a "richer experience"!  I have
indigestion of the brain already.  Give me a more ascetic experience.
