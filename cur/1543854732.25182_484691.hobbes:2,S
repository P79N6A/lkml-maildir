Subject: [PATCH 3/3] ext2/3/4: enable "undeletable" file attribute.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

Currently, although you can mark a file as undeletable with 'chattr'...
  > touch /tmp/wibble
  > ls -l /tmp/wibble
  -rw-rw-r-- 1 james james 0 Nov 16 20:00 /tmp/wibble
  > chattr +u /tmp/wibble      # mark file as undeletable
  > lsattr /tmp/wibble
  -u----------- /tmp/wibble
... it's not honoured by the kernel:
  > rm /tmp/wibble             # yikes! this should fail!!
This patch makes ext4 aware of the undeletable attribute such that
attempting to delete a file marked as undeltable works as expected:
  > chattr +u /tmp/wibble      # mark file as undeletable
  > lsattr /tmp/wibble
  -u----------- /tmp/wibble
  > rm /tmp/wibble
  rm: cannot remove `/tmp/wibble': Operation not permitted
  > chattr -u /tmp/wibble      # remove undeletable attribute
  > lsattr /tmp/wibble
  ------------- /tmp/wibble
  > rm /tmp/wibble             # works as expected this time
Tested with e2fsprogs-1.38-12 (FC5).
