Well, everyone still doesn't seem to agree on the proper way forward
here, so for me to just "pick one" isn't very appropriate.
So, can we try again?
Can people submit, what they think the change should be?  Right now I
have Arjan's patch in my kernel tree, but will not send it to Linus for
.25 for now, unless everyone thinks that is the best solution at the
moment (which, for me, I'm leaning toward right now...)
thanks,
