Hi,
Thanks for your help, but I think you're wrong:
First, I never trust hotplug or other tools like this:
I do all insmod by hand, so I know all drivers have been loaded.
What is hotplug supposed to do (but wasn't in previous driver
version...) ?
The second thing I see is that it used to work,
before 2.4.21-rc2. The only difference is in the kernel driver,
so it should work with no user-space tool, as it used to.
If not, the driver is now buggy...
Regards.
