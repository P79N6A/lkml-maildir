Ahh. Never mind. It looks like the RCS/CCS difference is encoded in the 
index that is used to offset the base, which means that rcs_base and 
ccs_base really do end up being the same thing.
Still, I'd love to have somebody verify that the cleaned-up version 
(without any changes) still works. It should be 100% equivalent to the old 
one, but it's good to make sure.
