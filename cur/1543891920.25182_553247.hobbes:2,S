Because it's author has shown his preference for crappy code.  Can we
please stop this stupid 'upstream' term here?  LZO is first and most
and algorithm.  There is a really crappy reference implementation, but
we should not put that in but rather have a proper implementation targeted
at the linux kernel.  Whether that implementation starts from scratch or
by gradually improving the existing reference implementation doesn't matter.
