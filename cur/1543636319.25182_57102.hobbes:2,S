you are right in that the Linux scheduler does not enable classic
gang-scheduling: where multiple processes are scheduled 'at once' on
multiple CPUs. Can you point out specific (real-life) workloads where this
would be advantegous? Some testcode would be the best form of expressing
this. Pretty much any job that uses sane (kernel-based or kernel-helped)
synchronization should see good throughput.
