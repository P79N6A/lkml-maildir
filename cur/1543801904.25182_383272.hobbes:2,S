Most of the infrastructure is already there and the cost of doing the 
extra bits required to get this metric would be extremely small.  The 
hardest bit would be deciding on the "limit" to be applied when deciding 
whether to let a supposed interactive task stay on the active array.
 From the statistical point of view, the distribution of random time 
intervals with a given average length is such that about 99% of them 
will be less than four times the average length.  So a value of 1/4 of 
the delay in array switches that can be tolerated would be about right. 
  But that still leaves the problem of what delay can be tolerated :-).

By the way, it seems you have your own scheduler versions?  If so are 
you interested in adding them to the collection in PlugSched?
