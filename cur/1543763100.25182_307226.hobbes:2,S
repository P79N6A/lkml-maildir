 Good point on including the pointer to the web site.  As you probably
 noticed, there is a history of the design, papers presented, etc.
 Also, Jonathan Corbet did a nice write up from the discussion at the
 2004 Kernel summit which is archived here: 
http://lwn.net/Articles/94573/
 which may be of use.
 The OLS and LinuxTag papers are archived at the site that you pointed
 to and there will be a tutorial on configuring, using and writing
 controllers for CKRM at OLS this year.  You may also want to see the
 previous postings of this code to LKML for more background.
 In short, CKRM provides very basic desktop to server workload management
 capabilities similar to those provided by most of the old fashioned
 operating systems.  The code provides a fairly simple mechanism for
 adding controllers for any resource type and the code is currently
 widely deployed by PlanetLab, a part of Novell/SuSE's distro, and
 the capabilities are requested by a fair number of Linux users and
 customers.

 Fair point.  We have been running some of the smaller benchmarks but
 have not yet had a chance to do any kind of performance comparison
 based on the current code.  However, when configured out, it will
 have zero impact.  We do have some performance analysis of the code
 with CONFIG_CKRM set to y but no rules configured planned for the
 very near future.

 Yeah - that works well in some cases but it turns out to not do so
 well when an argument to a function refers to a structure element
 which is not configured in.  In that case, the compiler emits a
 reference to an undefined structure value in the case of the static
 inline, where otherwise the entire set of code is pre-processed
 away.  I think we've gone through the code and used the correct
 balance of static inlines and #define constructs as appropriate.
 If we've missed any, I'm more than willing to accept a patch to
 correct a specific instance.

 The code is the documentation?  :)
 There is probably some documentation on /proc/<pid>/ in general and
 we'll see if we can get it updated appropriately.  Vivek?

 Got it - thanks!  Someone liked the new word "atleast" - at least
 three occurences removed.
 Oh - and uniformly updated diffstats - I probably missed some when
 I was playing with quilt originally.
