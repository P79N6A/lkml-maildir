USB CDC 1.1 does not specify how these error indications
relate to subsequent bulk data packets. I could not find
manufacturer info that helps. BSD drivers don't do
error processing at all.
Here is a patch that applies the error only to the
next receive byte instead of all bytes in the
next read bulk packet.
Greg: Any comment?
Oleksiy: Can you try this patch?
Thanks,
Paul
