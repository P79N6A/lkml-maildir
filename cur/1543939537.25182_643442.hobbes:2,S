I've merged it all, but it causes lots of scary warnings:
 - from the purely broken ones:
	ehci_hcd: no version for "struct_module" found: kernel tainted.
 - to the scary ones:
	sysfs: duplicate filename 'ehci_hcd' can not be created

and the problem seems to be that it does all these checks even for modules 
that will never be loaded, because I use my own kernel, but with the 
default Fedora initrd (which is trying to load modules for stuff that I 
already have built in).
Very annoying.
Can we please do that *after* the module loading symbol checks have run, 
so that when you try to load a module that will not load, it won't 
complain about these silly things?
(You can probably trigger this by simply trying to load a module that was 
compiled for another kernel version - it will fail fine, but in failing it 
will then generate all these incorrect warnings!)
Now it incorrectly taints my kernel, for no good reason.
