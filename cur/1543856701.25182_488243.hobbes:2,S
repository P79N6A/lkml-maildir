Wot?  memory policies are a per-vma thing?
Plus NUMA of course supports more that a single zone.  Perhaps you meant
one zone per node.  If you did, that's a pretty dumb-sounding restriction
and I don't know where you got it from.

I suspect you'll have to live with that.  I've yet to see a vaguely sane
proposal to otherwise prevent unreclaimable, unmoveable kernel allocations
from landing in a hot-unpluggable physical memory region.
