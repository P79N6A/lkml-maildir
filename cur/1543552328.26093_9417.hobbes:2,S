Comparing different architectures and implementations by raw clock speed is
absolutely meaningless. You might try standard CPU/machine benchmarks (like
the Byte benchmarks, f.ex.).
Also note that the OS and language implementation comes into the
picture. It would probably be most fair to compare AmigaOS with DOS (no
separate user/system space). Plus they are of approximately the same
vintage.

Check sizes of object files (*.o) not full executables. Check memory-
resident sizes (size(1)), not file sizes (which can include huge debugging
information).

Yes. But this is far from a general-purpose system, and it was clearly
heavyly hacked to size. I've build linux-on-a-diskette systems myself...
and given a smallish VGA-only browser (can be done! but what is the point?)
Linux could do the same.

Where is Linux (the kernel) slow and clunky? Or are you blaming the bloat
of Netscape on Linux?
You know, this kind of sweeping comments without a shred of fact or at
least a closer look for the origins of what you are complaining about to
back them up just make you look bad. Soon you'll end up in everybody's
killfile, or at least with a mental note "read for possible amusement,
ignore otherwise".

Then stay well away from experimental patches, and unsupported hardware.
And do as you were told: Go read about OS design, Unix in particular. Get a
hold on X design. 
Then check out the PC design, and compare it with anything built 10 years
before. Keep the barfbag handy.

Then help out getting there. Complaining gets you into killfiles, nowhere
else. Or pick up a oh-so-wonderful-other-OS that gives you all that and
leave us alone.

You do realize that all this is extremely rude, don't you?
