Ingo,
My ServerWorks HE chipset is a close cousin.  The common BIOS was written
by Intergraph, and marketed by Phoenix.  It somehow fails to communicate
its decisions about IRQ routing to Linux.  One may get lucky by moving
hardware around but, with the following patch, you are guaranteed use
of the chipset USB while still enjoying the IO-APIC.  Patch has been
necessary from 2.4.0 through 2.4.17 and, by the sounds of it, to current
2.4 versions.
You must edit the patch to use the correct IRQ for your hardware config
(11 in my case).  To determine the IRQ, access USB hardware while
monitoring interrupt counts in /proc/stat
