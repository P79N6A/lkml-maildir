Looks like a dumb bug in ide-cd. The error is coming from mrw_exit.
That gets called because ide-cd sets mask to 0 "I do everything" and
then subtracts features by checking drive bits. What it should do is set
the mask to every flag it knows about and then work back.
The ide-cd code doesn't know about CDC_MRW_W so its always a zero bit in
the mask, CDROM_CAN(CDC_MRW_W) is always true and cache flushes get
written.
