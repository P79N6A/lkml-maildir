Chris:
My system is currently this:
	1st partition - NT (I know.  That is why I am migrating to
				Linux)
	2nd partition - Linux swap
	3rd partition - Linux native
I have Redhat 6.0 (kernel 2.2.5-15) installed on the
linux partition.  To get into linux, I boot from the
boot floppy created during the installation of redhat.
Here is what I did:
	1. Downloaded linux-2.2.13.tar.gz into /usr/src
		and de-archived it.
	2. Went into /usr/src/linux and typed 
		make config
		make dep
		make
		make bzImage
		make bzdisk (This created a floppy for me)
	3. Copied /usr/src/linux/arch/i386/boot/bzImage to
		/boot/vmlinuz-2.2.13
	4. Edited /etc/lilo.conf and made the image line
		image=/boot/vmlinuz-2.2.13
	5. Ran /sbin/lilo and it said:
		Added linux *
When I booted from the floppy, I got a BUNCH of messages
saying that /boot/System.map has an incorrect version 
number.
I re-read the kernel howto and it does not seem to cover
this case at all.
I dont know if I need a lilo boot disk or what.
I am new to this an trying to figure things out.
Thanks,
	Neil.
