While doing qrcu, somehow I convinced myself we can't optimize out taking
qp->mutex. Now I think I was wrong. Good!
Q: you deleted "if (atomic_read(qp->ctr + idx) == 1)" fastpath under ->mutex,
was this needed for this optimization to work? I am asking because I can't
understand how it can make any difference.

Yes. But let me think more about this later, I've got a fever, and can't
think properly today :)
