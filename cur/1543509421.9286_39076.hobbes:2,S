hello,
i'm experiencing strange network delays too. it happens on out server
placed in ISP's building connected to Net using 10Mbit Ethernet. this
server uses kernel 2.0.37 + IPchains patch.
symptoms (experienced through ssh sessions, web access and occasionaly
from ping stats) are as follows: with (for now) unknown period and/or
cause there are about 30-60 seconds windows when no packets comes from
server (duno whether server is receiving). it also looks like packets
packets are getting lost through this blind-window period (not even late
ping replies, "a lot" of HTTP operation timeout entries in apache log).
for now i'm going to setup some measure method so i can learn more.
anybody experienced something similar too?
