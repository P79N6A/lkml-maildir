I don't quite understand why we did this.  The subsequent logic in
kmalloc_index() should return -1 for this `size' anyway.  If it doesn't,
it's bust, isn't it?
Also, afaict kmalloc_slab() will totally mishandle the -1 return value and
will return a garbage kmem_cache*, via
        return &kmalloc_caches[index];
Could you double-check it all please?
