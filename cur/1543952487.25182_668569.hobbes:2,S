Unless you have specific docs from VIA saying that this register
isn't revision-specific (at least in the sense that all revisions
after 0x60 define that bit in that way), this should probably be a
switch on pdev->revision and just include the known-safe revisions.
At one point I had a table mapping those revision codes to
specific VIA chips.  Too bad I didn't keep it.  ISTR that the
VT6212 has a newer revision code than the vt8235 southbridge,
and probably not as new as the vt8237 one...
But otherwise, yes -- that's the kind of patch I'd sign off on
after making this comment a bit more informative about how
that 1 usec sleep time creates an amount of PCI bus hogging.
