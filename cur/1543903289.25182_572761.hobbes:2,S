As for paravirt, it'd really help. As I had the tree lagged behind by
so much, a great part of the work now is checking where i386 is,
seeing if it applies for 64-bit, and so on. The differences are not so
huge, and I'm trying my best to not let them deviate too much. It
could mostly be built incrementally.
And I bet a huge part of the tree could be like this too: In most
places, they are different for no particular reason, just because two
people implemented it separately. There'd be a huge effort to bring
those differences into an end, but I think I'd pay in future
development speed. (not to mention the duplicate bugs linus have
already talked about)

I am pretty much for it too.
