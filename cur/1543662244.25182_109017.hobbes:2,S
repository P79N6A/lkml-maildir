But with both drivers built into the kernel, it'll always default
to the first one that gets initialised. There's a common
PCI_DEVICE_ID_FIR701 in the pci_device_id tables of both drivers.
It sounds like these should be mutually exclusive when built-in.
If you need a configuration with both, use modules.
