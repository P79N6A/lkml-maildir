PPS API is not only a periphal class. RFC 2783 defines new «functions»
that allow accesso to internal system data collected by some
periferals but these devices are never managed as a tipical char or
block device.
I think implementing parts or full RFC 2783 PPS's functions as
syscalls are not so wrong... IMHO, at least! :)

I see, but consider that some PPS devices cannot be always connected
with a filedescriptor since, for example, some PPS devices are
connected by serial lines, other by parallel ports and other
(expecially on embedded systems) are connected by CPU's GPIOs.
An userland programs shouldn't know whenever these devices are
connected, they should only know how to collect PPS data from the
system.

I already removed such functions in my latest patches. :)
Thanks,
