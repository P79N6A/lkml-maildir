A failed attempt :-)

No it should not, not if you are passing control to ide-scsi. /dev/sg0
is the sg char device, you cannot mount that. Look at your messages:
ide-scsi: hdc: unsupported command in request queue (0)
end_request: I/O error, dev 16:01 (hdc), sector 64
isofs_read_super: bread failed, dev=16:01, iso_blknum=16, block=32
mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/hdc1,
You are mounting major 16h (22, hdc), not /dev/scd0. This is a user
error, not a bug.
