So if it's not a requirement of the GPLv3, then Tivo could deny content based 
signing the binary image of the Linux kernel and using that signature as 
authentication on their network (or their content providers network).  A 
modified Tivo box would not be able to preform it's original task of being a PVR 
at that point, at least with the content provider's signal.  Seems pretty 
pointless to me.  Seems like almost the same thing as not allowing an unsigned 
Linux kernel to boot on the system.  Though it would still be possible to get 
the Tivo box to play tetris or something like that.
