That's fine.  All you need for these embedded users is a user-space
daemon that feeds data from the hardware directly into /dev/random.
No matter how small your system is, I'm sure you can spare a few
hundred bytes for such a thing.
In fact most of these systems will have some sort of a general-purpose
daemon that sits around which can perform such a task.
System calls on Linux are fast enough that there is really no
advantage in doing this in the kernel.
But if you're really desparate, write a kernel module that does this
in a kernel thread.
