Which old programs will break if fstat() returns the length of the
default file?  (I can't think of any).
Which programs will break if fstat() returns S_ISREG when there's a
default file?  (Should be ok -- there's a file there after all).
Note that flexibility can be retained by opening "albod/" (trailing
slash) to force interpretation as a directory.
