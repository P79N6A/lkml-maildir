300 day uptime with 2.5 ?  Do think again.
These are 2.4 series kernels.  2.4.17, 2.4.18, 2.4.20
With updated 'ps' tools the processes are definitely in the past,
although seeing mere "2002" does not tell all that detailed about
"when".  A "apr17" would be more usefull.  Any date in "future"
means it is of previous year.
