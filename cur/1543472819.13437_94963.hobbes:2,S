I added the ioctl pair, but I made the pair specifically for
VLANs.  I didn't see a good way to generalize it.  I did not
add the methods to the device struct, because when I want to add a
new device, I don't have that device allocated yet.  I do have
a method that I can call, so I just make that call from the dev.c
ioctl method.
So, got all this compiling, but I still have a large gap in
my understanding of the whole thing:  What calls dev_ioctl with
the specific arguments that will allow me to create new VLANs?
If someone could show me the call path from user space down to
dev_ioctl, I would be greatful.  A code example (btw, where's the
best place to get the source for ifconfig??) would be marvelous!
Thanks,
Ben
