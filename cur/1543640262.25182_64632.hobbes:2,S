One of the problems, I believe, is that reading from /dev/urandom will
also deplete the entropy pool, just like reading from /dev/random.
The only difference is that when the entropy is gone /dev/random will
stop and /dev/urandom will continue to provide data.
If you are in there fixing things, it might make sense to have
/dev/urandom extract entropy from the random pool far less often than
/dev/random.  This way people who use /dev/urandom for a source of
less-strong randomness (e.g. TCP sequence numbers or whatever), will
not be shooting themselves in the foot for when they need a 2048-byte
PGP key, if they are low on entropy sources.
Cheers, Andreas
