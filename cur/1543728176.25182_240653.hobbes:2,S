This is what I have, the first of their fanless models I believe, 600Mhz
C3.
However ALSA always detected the CPU as a 686 and I never had problems,
it's definitely the change from CONFIG_MCYRIXIII to CONFIG_M586TSC that
started the lockups.
I recompiled all the ALSA libs and jackd, same problem - starting jackd
causes immediate lockup.  Now building with M486.
