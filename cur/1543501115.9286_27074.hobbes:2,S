For whats its worth, I agree 2.2.x it way too unstable. I wouldn't
recommend anybody switch to it as it stands now.
I've not had huge problems, mostly sound problems (which I am hoping to
look into as part of my first dip into kernel 'hacking') and a single
complete hang in X, but from reading the list and seeing the file
corruption 'reading beyond end of device' errors people have had in
2.2.10, I fell that something has gone wrong in the development process.
The scary thing is that the 2.3 codebase is branched off the relatively
unstable 2.2 codebase, so 2.4 will have the bugs introduced in 2.3, AND
ones from 2.2 that didn't/may not get fixed.
I really don't care about NT and FUD, but I would like to see things going
more in the direction of the 2.0.x kernels in terms of stability.
I don't think its proper to draw attention away from the 2.2.10 problems
with a comment as to how it is still maturing - Sure 2.0.x took 37
iterations to become 'fully' stable, but its troubling that there is so
much concern about the 2.3.x file corruption, and nothing about the 2.2.x
corruption (even though I personally don't experience it).
Fall isn't that far away, and I would really like to feel more confident
in the 2.2 kernel I'm running now before switching to the bigger and
better 2.4 :P
:( My two cents, anyway. I've been concerned for a bit, but don't consider
myself talented enough programmer to actively do anything about it (I'm
still learning...)
Sincerely,
Rene
