Actually, it might also be invalid in hypervisor environments.  s390 and
Xen use ballooning drivers to tell the hypervisor which pages are not
currently in use by the OS so that they may be used in virtual machines
elsewhere.
I'm cc'ing the s390 guys.  Will the s390 kernel oops if it accesses a
page which was ballooned back to the hypervisor?
