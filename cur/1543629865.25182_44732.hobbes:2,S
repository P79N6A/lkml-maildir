  I remember doing bank switching on IEEE-696 (S-100) system for both
programs and "ramdisk," when 64K (sic) was a lot of memory.

  At the moment Itanium is shipping, it makes up for being expensive by
also being slow ;-) However, Sun will sell you a 64bit UltraSPARC system
with everything but monitor for <$1K. Add a few GB and load Linux. I
*think* you can order with Linux preloaded now, but don't quote me on
that. It's not blindingly fast but it's blindingly cheap.
