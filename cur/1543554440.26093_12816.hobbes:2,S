Where can I find info about that ?
My first idea was to fire a timer and let the callback routine do the work,
but I worry about synchronization and about passing the list of items for it
to handle.
What is the accepted way of starting a kernel thread and how do I handle
parameters and sync. ?
	Thanks,

do_ioctl is inside rtnl_lock...
Remember if you need to alter the rules, you can always queue work in
the current context, and have a kernel thread handle the work.  The nice
thing about a kernel thread is that you start with a [almost] clean
state, when it comes to locks.
