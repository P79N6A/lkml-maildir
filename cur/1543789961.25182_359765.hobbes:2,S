Jeff, why don't you listen from time to time to people who work with
the technology on a daily basis who have experience with it, who
have _insight_ of the technology?  Such insight gives them great
intuition when it comes to design, among other things.

SMP is part of the protocol, of what the device (PCI) implements.  It is always
there, just like phys.  You do not need to create it from user space. It
will be there for a user process to use, via say SDI.  SDI provides this as
part of the controller.  Read the SDI spec.
Insight of the whole architecture is irreplacable to create good design.

Also note that everyone does domain discovery in the kernel/FW and not
only for SAS but for other domains (even non-SCSI).  While domain
discovery is in the kernel/FW, _control_ of the domain is given to
user space, via say SDI -- everyone agrees on this.
