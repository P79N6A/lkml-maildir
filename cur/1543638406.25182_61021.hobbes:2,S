thanks david/alan. we just turned our ia64 bit machines back to
intel, so I can't test itanium any longer.  INTEL didn't have any
issues with 64-bit functionality that they reported as of the 2.4
base quite a while back. i looked over the mods and they seem
fine to me. thanks for the work on the driver

I'll double check it and backport the changes to 2.4
