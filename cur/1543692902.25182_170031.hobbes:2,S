3Com recently released a driver update CD for Windows that includes an
update to the onboard flash firmware. If you wish to continue using the
cards under Linux, it is VITAL that you do not apply that update. If you
do, the card will no longer load the firmware image the Linux driver
uses.
I hope to with 3Com to resolve the issues, and hope to have a patch
soon.
Just wanted to give everyone a heads-up.
