If it helps at all, I have tried building test4 both with and without
the IEEE 1284 support.  The result is basically the same, other than
that with the IEEE 1284 support, I see identifying information from my
printer in dmesg.
This is an irritating glitch, so I'll be happy to test any patches
someone might have to offer.  Just be aware that I am relatively
inexperienced so you may have to get painfully explicit with your
instructions on how to apply your patch.

There are no physicists in the hottest parts of hell, because the
existence of a "hottest part" implies a temperature difference, and
any marginally competent physicist would immediately use this to
run a heat engine and make some other part of hell comfortably cool.
This is obviously impossible.
