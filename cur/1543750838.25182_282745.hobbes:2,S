The slightly stronger reason is basically the same reason why we don't 
stuff a bunch of things into a struct stat and call a single system call 
to change a bunch of attributes; you don't want to have to change them 
all every time, and by putting them all in the same structure that's 
your only option, since setxattr() doesn't allow you to mask and merge.
Incidentally, the document you pointed me to wasn't clear on the 
endianness convention.
