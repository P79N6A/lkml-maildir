Well, if you can't find it written down anymore, here, I'll give you a

We have one now, see above :)

Hey, everyone needs a windmill to chase after to define their life's
purpose...

Yes, I'm well aware of the /proc/cpu abusing that is done by many binary
programs (oracle, jvm, etc.)  But it's the other things that definitely
don't belong in there (like the /proc/drivers/ tree stuff) that should
get moved out over time.  What do you think I've been doing over the
past 3 years with sysfs...

Slowly, over time, with creating good, standardised things like sysfs
(which has order to it), and fun, anarchistic things like debugfs.
Between the combination of the two, we'll get closer to an ideal, which
is better than what we have today.

Why?  Each location is defined to have one, specific, well defined thing
there that people can count on (or not count on in the case of /debug.)
