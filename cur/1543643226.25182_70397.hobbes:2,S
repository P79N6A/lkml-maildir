This means that your smbmount process has terminated (crashed?). You could
try some things with that, eg upgrading samba to the latest 2.2.x, running
it with a higher debug level (4, check your smbmount.log), add more debug 
printouts to the smbmount main loop, getting a core dump from it.
The mount should become unusble at this point because smbfs no longer has 
a connection and it can't contact it's smbmount daemon to get a new one.

I believe this is at umount time. And if smb_delete_inode wants to 
actually close something and smb_retry is failing it won't be able to.
I need to find out if/why that would cause the busy message. When the 
connection closes any open files are closed, so closing shouldn't be a 
problem.
Did you get either of these the second time?
