Yeah, I saw that, and while I didn't remove it yet, it shouldn't be
getting called from anywhere because of CONFIG_GENERIC_CLOCKEVENTS
being set.  In fact, acpi_propagate_timer_broadcast() does get called,
and all that does it drop me back to hpet because of C3.  But, I didn't add
DUMMY yet, and I must've missed smth else.  Some of that got a little
tangled into the nice calibration cleanup, which I didn't want to suck
in until I understood what I had broken ;-)
thanks,
