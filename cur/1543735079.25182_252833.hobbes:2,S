Well, "there is more than one way of doing this", it seems.

Erm, somehow I came to thinking he wanted to schedule binaries on cpus of
different types.
Anyway, Andre, you are welcome :-).
One more thing - I remember reading on one Polish newsgroup devoted to
electronics, that making PCI cards is rather difficult (actually, nobody
wanted to try it) while one can do ISA cards "at home" or something like
this. I know ISA is out of business, but for "proof of concept" it may be
a better choice. Or maybe you (Andre) can do it with USB chip - it should
be even easier to make such device with USB and connect it to your host
this way. There are quite a few controllers available. I've searched for
ATMEL's and found this:

Of course, there must be others, too.
