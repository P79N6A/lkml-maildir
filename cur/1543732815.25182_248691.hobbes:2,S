I don't think it's unreasonable to expect someone to either extract the
whole tar file, or identify what files they want from it.  If you think
there is too much in the tar file, roll your own with only the files you
need.

This doesn't justify bloating the kernel.  untar the darn thing and user
space does fine.

Are you saying install it on demand the first time it's run?  This
doesn't take any new kernel function.
Or are you saying that the files are never installed on the filesystem,
but always accessed from the package archives?  In this case, why not
ship each package as a compressed iso, and have the system mount the iso
to run the app.  I really don't see the point though, in that disk space
is very cheap these days.

Optimization?  How much performance are you willing to give up to save a
little bit of disk space?
