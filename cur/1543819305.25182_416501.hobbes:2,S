I made tests on same system (x440) with postmark-1.51 :
pm> set numbers 100000
pm> set transactions 250000
pm> run
With atomic_t:
Time:
        3761 seconds total
        2414 seconds of transactions (103 per second)
Files:
        225064 created (59 per second)
                Creation alone: 100000 files (87 per second)
                Mixed with transactions: 125064 files (51 per second)
        124961 read (51 per second)
        124895 appended (51 per second)
        225064 deleted (59 per second)
                Deletion alone: 100128 files (503 per second)
                Mixed with transactions: 124936 files (51 per second)
Data:
        731.14 megabytes read (199.07 kilobytes per second)
        1359.02 megabytes written (370.02 kilobytes per second)
With percpu_counter:
Time:
        3787 seconds total
        2422 seconds of transactions (103 per second)
Files:
        225064 created (59 per second)
                Creation alone: 100000 files (85 per second)
                Mixed with transactions: 125064 files (51 per second)
        124961 read (51 per second)
        124895 appended (51 per second)
        225064 deleted (59 per second)
                Deletion alone: 100128 files (503 per second)
                Mixed with transactions: 124936 files (51 per second)
Data:
        731.14 megabytes read (197.70 kilobytes per second)
        1359.02 megabytes written (367.48 kilobytes per second)
