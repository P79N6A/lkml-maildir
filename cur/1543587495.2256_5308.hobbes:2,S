I can't say much about this... It looks like your setup is perfectly allright,
and the performance *should* go up.   Instead it looks like you get a small
performance drop from using the RAID.   Most odd.
Do you have more controllers in the machine ? If so could you try to move eg.
hdc to the second controller ?  The only thing I can imagine being the cause of
the poor performance is, if your controller somehow doesn't handle both
channels very well simultaneously.   It's far fetched, but it's the only
suggestion I can think of.
Maybe Andre has comments ?
I usually get a good speedup from using RAID-0 on 2.4.3 with IDE.  Both with
two disks and with six.   This is with Intel PIIX4 and Promise 20262
controllers.
