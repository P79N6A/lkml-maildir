Hi All,

Test on ICH4 is OK.
Test on ICH9 -> the watchdog timer runs but doesn't reboot the system anymore.
The following bits are active in SMI_EN and thus need to be investigated:
	13 - TCO_EN (Not relevant since we set/unset this allready)
	 5 - APMC_EN
	 4 - SLP_SMI_EN
	 3 - LEGACY_USB_EN
	 1 - End Of SMI
	 0 - GBL_SMI_EN
A first test indicated that if bit 0 is forced to 0, the system reboots again.
The second test reveals that setting bits 5, 4, 3 and 1 to 0 doesn't help the rebooting of the ICH9 chipset.
So the real issue with ICH9 and rebooting has to do with the GBL_SMI_EN bit.
So next step will be to create an additional patch and then test it with Rafael and Frans...
Kind regards,
Wim.
