Okay, so if we're to exclude CPU_GENERIC and MK8, I think that
makes my original patch the right one: here it is with a signoff.
I've now noticed that the machine I call MPENTIUM4 for 32-bit kernels
is called MPSC for 64-bit kernels, and in that case it still doesn't
get the P6 NOPs it ought to.  hpa explains that MK8 should still be
excluded, so it's just a matter of including MPSC along with MPENTIUM4.
