I've updated my patchset
It includes:
O(1) scheduler
Preempt
Low Latency
AA VM addons
Read Latency2
SuperMount
XFS
ACPI
DVD/CDRW packet writing
Desktop Tuning
optional extras:
Compressed caching
Rmap15d
Changes since ck3:
Supermount bug which caused random hangs has been quenched
AA VM has been updated to latest available
Packet writing for cdrw/dvd has been added
Rmap patch is now a patch which can be applied to the full ck4 patch which 
rips out the aa vmversion
Known bugs:
Accounting bug in supermount causes harmless error on shutdown.
It can be found here:

Domain name has changed sorry :-(
Please test carefully, especially the new features as I don't have the 
resources to test them out.
Feel free to contact me with suggestions, questions, comments, patches and 
requests
