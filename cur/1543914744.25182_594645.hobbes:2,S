Subject: [PATCH v2] Kconfig: Make MSI Laptop select BACKLIGHT_CLASS_DEVICE instead of depend
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/9/15/49

From: Matěj Laitl <strohel@gmail.com>
This simple patch helps users reveal this config option and makes MSI Laptop
more coherent with other laptop extras found in misc devices.
(this option was hidden until user says y to BACKLIGHT_CLASS_DEVICE under
Graphics drivers)
When at it, convert space indentation to tabs to match CodingStyle.

Please ignore any garbage from me that may have arrived in your inbox when I 
tried to send v1 of my patch. My apologies. (mail client misconfiguration)
Only change since v1 of this patch is space -> tabs conversion.
