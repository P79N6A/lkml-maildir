Ah..maybe you're right.
BTW, reading inclinde/linux/init.h again
==
/* modpost check for section mismatches during the kernel build.
 * A section mismatch happens when there are references from a
 * code or data section to an init section (both code or data).
 * The init sections are (for most archs) discarded by the kernel
 * when early init has completed so all such references are potential bugs.
 * For exit sections the same issue exists.
 * The following markers are used for the cases where the reference to
 * the *init / *exit section (code or data) is valid and will teach
 * modpost not to issue a warning.
 * The markers follow same syntax rules as __init / __initdata. */
#define __ref            __section(.ref.text) noinline
#define __refdata        __section(.ref.data)
#define __refconst       __section(.ref.rodata)

It seems init_refok is old style.
Could you convert to __ref ?
