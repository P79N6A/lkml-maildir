We have also explained why it's a problem and why "something" should care. 
The problem is clear, the solution is less clear. Some file systems already try to 
to handle the issue because the fs itself define the character set. That's the
argument for solving the issue with other file systems the same way. It's also only 
the fs media that can reliably know this since media are movable these days.

That's NLS support, which is already there. Conceivably this could be
a compile-time option for the file systems that due legacy do not state
what character set/encoding is to be used so the system could be tuned
for use in a homogeneous environment w.r.t locale.

The needs are not "technical", they are "user" needs. (I hear them laughing
in Redmond).
