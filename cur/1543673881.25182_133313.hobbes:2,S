As of today, I know of a device that has 5 interrupts and another
with 2 interrupts.  I believe two resources is the most I've seen
so far on a "dumb" on-chip device.
I think having an array of irqs and resources of max count 8 should
do it for now.
No matter what we choose, the hardware designers will screw it up
eventually.
