Really?  Why am I the one receiving bounces from FETCHMAIL-DAEMON 
when subscribers to mailing lists misconfigure their boxes?  I am 
completely unable to fix the problem, or even notify the user that 
they are *losing* mail due to the broken design you came up with.  
Meanwhile, I see you involved in lots of pointless threads on l-k 
without understanding the typical usage patterns of kernels and 
how distros actually support them.
