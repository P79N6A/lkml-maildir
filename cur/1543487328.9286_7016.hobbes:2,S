I see your point. What about architectures with sane L1/L2 caches? Also,
even if we assume that most architectures would benefit from this from the
pure cache alignment point of view, this method penalizes the 'common, few
threads' case, and optimizes the 'many threads' case. Even heavily loaded
servers get only very rarely into double digits runqueue sizes ... The
Linux scheduler is _not_ optimized for long runqueues. (That having said,
we are not bad with long runqueues either, but if you have non-benchmark
long runqueues, you'll probably have bigger problems than scheduler
overhead ...)
