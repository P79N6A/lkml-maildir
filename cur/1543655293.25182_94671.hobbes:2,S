I've been using the following script in my install images to find kernel
modules for various PCI devices (the mechanism's not perfect, though,
I know of at least one module that "doesn't put" its ids in modules.pcimap):
#!/bin/sh
PATH=/bin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/usr/sbin
PCIMAP=/lib/modules/$(uname -r)/modules.pcimap
ALLDEV=$(lspci -n| sed -e 's/^.*:[[:blank:]]\+\([^[:blank:]]\+\).*$/\1/')
if [ -n "$ALLDEV" -a -r $PCIMAP ]; then
  for i in $ALLDEV; do
    VENDOR="$(echo $i| cut -d':' -f1)"
    DEVICE="$(echo $i| cut -d':' -f2)"
    MODULE=$(grep "0x0000$VENDOR[[:blank:]]\+0x0000$DEVICE" $PCIMAP| \
      awk '{ print $1; }')
    echo -n "Vendor $VENDOR, dev $DEVICE: "
    if [ -n "$MODULE" ]; then
      echo $MODULE
    else
      echo "(no matching module)"
    fi
  done
fi
