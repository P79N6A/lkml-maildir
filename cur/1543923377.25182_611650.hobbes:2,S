The more I have stared at this, the more certain I've become that we
need to make the mbind/mempolicy calls modal -- the default mode
continues to interpret node numbers and masks just as these calls do
now, and the alternative mode provides the so called "Choice B",
which takes node numbers and masks as if the task owned the entire
system, and then the kernel internally and automatically scrunches
those masks down to whatever happens to be the current cpuset of
the task.
