don't really understand. Either you accept an IP packet based on it's src
address or not, or allow a tcp connection to be made or not. Why in the case
of a tcp connection, break a connection? The IP address won't change.. if it
does it's not part of the same connection.
And if the IP address is spoofed you can't really know unless it's on the
same network as you. And anyway you should have your router disallow local
network IP's coming in from external net's anyway. 
confused,
Paul Jakma.
