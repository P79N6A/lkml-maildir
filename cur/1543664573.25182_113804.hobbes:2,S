The IDE layer needs to obtain the IRQ with interrupts disabled. It
isnt alone in that either. I can't guarantee to mask the IRQ
because not all supported hardware has working irq masking.
disable/enable_irq on unallocated interrupts is undefined, and
does not work on at least one supported platform at all.
Unfortunately ten years ago someone created 'register_and_activate_irq'
calling it 'register_irq', and it hasn't yet been fixed.
So its up to the arch maintainers to fix it, or they don't
get IDE support 8)
