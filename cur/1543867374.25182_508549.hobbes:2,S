Well, I only have bug reports from around half a dozen people, so I'm
not sure what that says about my userbase (for most people it should
simply work).
lguest.ozlabs.org got 3000 hits in the last 12 hours, and they can't all
be bots 8)  Mind you, in that time only 26 unique IP addresses visited
the patches/ repository, so maybe they are...
As to "insufficient review", the reviews so far have cleaned up some
code (great!) and found 3 actual bugs, none real showstoppers and all
now fixed:
 (1) race of initialization code vs. cpu hotplug.
 (2) block driver being suboptimal
 (3) network driver sending crap for inter-guest sendfile.
In addition, you counted not handling TSC change as a bug, so I tore
that code out, instead of leaving a FIXME.  During the cleanup patches I
did introduce (and then fix) another bug, it is true.
I would not describe it as "heavily in development"; I really think it's
at the stage where it can benefit from being in-tree.

Please don't harass my users.  That's my job!
Cheers!
