how so? 80% is not enough? I also checked Fedora and it has SCHED_DEBUG=y 
in its kernel rpms.
note that there's also a performance issue here: we generally _dont want_ 
a debug sysctl overhead in the mutex code or in any fastpath for that 
matter. So making it depend on SCHED_DEBUG is useful.
sched_feat() features get optimized out at build time when SCHED_DEBUG is 
disabled. So it gives us the best of two worlds: the utility of sysctls in 
the SCHED_DEBUG=y, and they get compiled out in the !SCHED_DEBUG case.
