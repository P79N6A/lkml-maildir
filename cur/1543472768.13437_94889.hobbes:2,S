Hmmm -- something like /dev/~zero would work, if you can stand non-
alphanumeric characters in your filenames.

Of course you're correct -- however, the U.S. DoD standards specify a secure
wipe as I described above, whether it was an encrypted filesystem or not.
Many U.S. government agencies require this before they will dispose of old
equipment.  Besides, data which isn't there at all is inherently more secure
than data which is there, but encrypted.
