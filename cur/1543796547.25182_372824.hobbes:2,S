Nope, but I don't see how udev can possibly detect something that doesn't let 
the OS know it's there-- except, of course, loading the driver for it and 
seeing if it works.

Which might be a case for leaving devfs in. *shrug*

Didn't say it could...

Well, I was assuming you kept Gentoo's udev packages up to date. ;)

I'm assuming everything in /etc/udev/rules.d/50-udev.rules used to be in the 
kernel for devfs-- perhaps it was PAM though, I'm not sure.
Other than that, I don't expect that simply installing a new kernel module 
will allow the device to be detected automatically, but that some hotplug or 
udev configurations will need to be updated also.
