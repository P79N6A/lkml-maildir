As stated, we actually did not run any guests and did not load the kvm 
kernel modules.
The host root file system gets corrupted to an extend not correctable 
by the file system checker (we gave it 24h to repair, then interrupted 
it), and it's very easy to reproduce: a simple kernel make on the 
hosts lets us reinstall the entire host operating system.
