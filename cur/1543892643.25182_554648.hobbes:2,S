People can and do roll updated install images because you get systems
that aren't supported by the released CD boot image. The installer/initrd
etc shouldn't keep getting broken by these kind of changes, its about
time that all the sysfs type breakage causing patches simply got
rejected, like such patches would in every other subsystem.
Yes it might cause a little pain, yes someone might have to tweak sysfs a
bit to keep compatibility and decouple the external and internal view a
bit - Matthew and others pointed out this problem several years ago and
predicted the current state of affairs, so its had a lot of time to get
fixed.
