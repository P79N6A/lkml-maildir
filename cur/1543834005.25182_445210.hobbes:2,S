mlocked is an exceptional case. The problem is that the information if a 
page is mlocked is only available via the vma. One has to
scan the reverse list and check all the vmas for the flag.
Is mlock that important?
What other types of non freeable pages could exist?
Maybe slab allocations and direct kernel allocations? We have only
limited means to reclaim those pages.
