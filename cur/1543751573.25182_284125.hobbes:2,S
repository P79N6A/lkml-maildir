Ok, that's fine with me, makes it easier for patches.  I'll take my
writeup and Randy's and split them out.

Hm, but things "change" all the time.  "new" rules become "old" rules
over time too.  What should probably happen is the proper rules are
documented and kept up to date, like they are today in
Documentation/filesystems/Locking and Documentation/pci.txt as two
examples.  Showing what has changed over time in those two files is what
diffs are for :)
Otherwise, the kernel changelogs are good places to dig for changes in
apis, but do we really want to duplicate this in other places too?
thanks,
