Well prior to the most recent version, calling it "beta" was putting it 
kindly.  I would call it broken :) which was why it was marked with 
CONFIG_BROKEN...
As of the most recent 2.6.5-rc2-bk snapshots, libata and sata_sil should 
be pretty happy with each other.
Some of the VIA problems were actually platform-related.  "noapic", 
"nomce", turning -on- local APIC support, and a few other workarounds 
have been found for these.
If you're on x86-64, make sure you have the latest BIOS version, too.
