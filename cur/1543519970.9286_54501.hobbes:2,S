This is the case.
I discussed with my administrator the new informations from your mail
and he told me that the network I am connetcted to is 10baseT. But he
said, there are many other machines connected to this network, and it
could be a problem that knfsd uses UDP, because of the worse 
handling of lost fragments.
So, for the moment, using the "old" nfs server seems to be the solution
for me. Or do you have another idea to reach with knfsd the same
performance as with the "old" nfsd?
