Subject: [sched, patch] better wake-balancing

another approach would be the patch below, to do wakeup-balancing only 
if the wakeup CPU or the task CPU is idle.
I've measured half-loaded tbench and unless total wakeup-balancing 
removal it does not degrade with this patch applied, while fully loaded 
tbench and other workloads clearly improve.
Ken, could you give this one a try? (It's against the current scheduler 
queue in -mm, but also applies fine to current Linus trees.)

do wakeup-balancing only if the wakeup-CPU or the task-CPU is idle.
this prevents excessive wakeup-balancing while the system is highly
loaded, but helps spread out the workload on partly idle systems.
