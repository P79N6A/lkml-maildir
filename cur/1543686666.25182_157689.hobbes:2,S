Subject: Problem with framebuffer in 2.6.0-test3

If I compile with framebuffer I get weird results during boot.
When I use "vga=normal", I get this weird screen during boot.
It doesn't show any text.  It just lots of coloured pixels.
When I use "vga=0x301" I just get a blank screen during boot.
In the init scripts I call fbset to set the proper resolution,
which work in both cases.
Here is part of my .config:
CONFIG_FB=y
# CONFIG_FB_CIRRUS is not set
# CONFIG_FB_PM2 is not set
# CONFIG_FB_CYBER2000 is not set
# CONFIG_FB_IMSTT is not set
CONFIG_FB_VGA16=y
CONFIG_FB_VESA=y
CONFIG_VIDEO_SELECT=y
# CONFIG_FB_HGA is not set
# CONFIG_FB_RIVA is not set
# CONFIG_FB_MATROX is not set
# CONFIG_FB_RADEON is not set
# CONFIG_FB_ATY128 is not set
# CONFIG_FB_ATY is not set
# CONFIG_FB_SIS is not set
# CONFIG_FB_NEOMAGIC is not set
CONFIG_FB_3DFX=y
# CONFIG_FB_VOODOO1 is not set
# CONFIG_FB_TRIDENT is not set
# CONFIG_FB_PM3 is not set
# CONFIG_FB_VIRTUAL is not set
