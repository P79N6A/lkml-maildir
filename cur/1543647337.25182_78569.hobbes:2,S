But as someone else pointed out (sorry I'm to lazy to check the thread),
one would still be able to manually adjust the Linux routing table to get it
into the /10 behaviour.
So frankly I'm not too fussed which behaviour is the default,  I was just
pointing out (what to me seemed to be) a change of dubious quality.
