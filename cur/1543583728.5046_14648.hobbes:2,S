You could try turning off DMA (rebuild your kernel again, and turn off "use
DMA by default").  UDMA is known to work reliably only with a (reasonably
broad) subset of chipsets, and it is likely that laptop chipsets get the
least testing.  If turning off DMA fixes the problem for you, we at least
know where to start looking.
