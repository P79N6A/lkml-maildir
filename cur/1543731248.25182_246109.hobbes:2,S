Hi,
DA> +   As of kernel 2.6.8 there was a bug-fix release numbering scheme
DA> +   introduced. In such cases a fourth number is added to the release
DA> +   version, eg. 2.6.8.1. When patching from a 2.6.xx(.x) release to a
DA> +   newer version, patches are to be applied against the original
DA> +   release, eg. 2.6.8 and not the bug-fix release 2.6.8.1. Old patches
DA> +   can be reversed by adding the "-R" option to patch.
DA> +
How about giving an example like:
    To apply a bugfix release patch:
    # cd /usr/src/linux-2.6.8
    # patch -p1 <../patch-2.6.8.1
    To apply a new release on a bugfix tree:
    # cd /usr/src/linux-2.6.8.1
    # patch -p1 -R <../patch-2.6.8.1
    # patch -p1 <../patch-2.6.9
Examples are always good.
Regards,
Maciej
