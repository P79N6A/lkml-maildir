I should have added "I may be wrong but I think that ...".
My opinion is based on a lot of experience with different types of 
scheduler design and the observation from gathering scheduling 
statistics while playing with these schedulers that the size of the time 
slices we're talking about is much larger than the CPU chunks most tasks 
use in any one go so time slice size has no real effect on most tasks 
and the faster CPUs become the more this becomes true.

Yes.  In fact its' probably better to use the maximum number of threads 
allowed on the system for N.  We know that value don't we?
