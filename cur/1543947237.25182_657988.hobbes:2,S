Reasonable enough, as long as it can be determined to be not needed.
Still, isn't the __vsyscall_gtod_data structure part of the same page?
Wouldn't that give you access to any 2-byte opcode you want every 64k
seconds?  You'd need to time your attack, of course, but that could be
done prior to actually launching the exploit...
