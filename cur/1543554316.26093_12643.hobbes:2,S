I've got a machine here that locks solid every time with -test10.  It
locks up towards the end of start_uhci, where it calls:
----
/* disable legacy emulation */
pci_write_config_word (dev, USBLEGSUP, USBLEGSUP_DEFAULT);
----
Now, disabling this call seems to make the system work perfectly.  The
machine is a Celeron 500 / Asus P3B-F (I think, it's at the office).
Also -test8 works, I haven't tried any of the test11-pre* versions yet.
Any things I should try to test?  (Please CC me, as I don't have the
time to follow linux-kernel as closely as I would like at the moment.)
-Harald
