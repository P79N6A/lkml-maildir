FFS gives you garbage, ext2fs gives you a file where the last few updates
were lost.

With FFS you are more likely to get corrupt but apparently correct files,
and on some versions are highly likely to end up with blocks attached
to the file that were never 'cleaned' from their previous usage.
With ex2ts thats still possible but its more likely you end up with a slightly
shorter file where recent updates were lost
