At least in suspend-to-ram (S3), power down part is not even
called. [Its suspend, we are not powering off, after all.]
On S3 resume you should wait for disks to spin up, so you need resume
handler.
I used same stuff for S3 and S4, which means I do need to spin them
down even for S4. I believe same handlers for S3 and S4 suspend/resume
is right thing to do...
