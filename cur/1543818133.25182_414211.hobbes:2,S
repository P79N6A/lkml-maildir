Subject: [PATCH] md: Make sure 64bit fields in version-1 metadata are 64-bit aligned.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This patch should go in 2.6.17-rc2 if at all possible.  If the problem
gets left much longer, a more ugly solution might be needed.
### Comments for Changeset
reshape_position is a 64bit field that was not 64bit aligned.
So swap with new_level.
NOTE: this is a user-visible change.  However:
  - The bad code has not appeared in a released kernel
  - This code is still marked 'experimental'
  - This only affects version-1 superblock, which are not in wide use
  - These field are only used (rather than simply reported) by user-space
    tools in extemely rare circumstances : after a reshape crashes in the
    first second of the reshape process.
So I believe that, at this stage, the change is safe.  Especially if
people heed the 'help' message on use mdadm-2.4.1.
