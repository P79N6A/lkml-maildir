It breaks all sorts of exclusions common for 2.4 and 2.6.

Yup.  And it won't be easy (if at all feasible).

That works and is trivial to implement.

Maybe...

(2) is going to be very nasty.  Keep in mind that there is locking
based on having unique struct block_device.  And entire area is not
too nice to start with - we still have lots of cleanup to do in 2.7.
Try it if you really want to, but I'd expect a lot of hard-to-plug
holes.
(3) is absolutely trivial - will take 10--30 lines in md.c.
No comments on (4).
