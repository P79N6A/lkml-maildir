I agree with all of you.
/dev/shm is widely available, and is a filesystem of the desired type.
/var is intended for this kind of data, and /var/run seems intuitively
the right location. But /dev as well as /var are often mountpoints. So
to use those locations would introduce more mountpoints that will need
special care early in the startup scripts. And mounting them before
running fsck is a problem.
All of those thoughts is what lead me to the suggestion of a new
directory or symlink in the root. You can point it anywhere you want
mtab. And you don't need to mount any filesystems before the symlink
can be used. A symlink in the other direction would not work that well.
