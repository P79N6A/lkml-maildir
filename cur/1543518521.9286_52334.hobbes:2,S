When you close a handle the final close only takes affect when everyone has
stopped using the handle. That is after the select returns

More likely it is that the poll() function for a listening socket does not
wake on closed. In fact this appears to be the problem.
If you edit net/ipv4/tcp.c:tcp_close() and move the
	sk->shutdown = SHUTDOWN_MSK
above the 
	if (sk->state == LISTEN)
Then I think it will work. Let me know
