Ever since I went SMP, I've noticed strange locks. 
1) gcc 2.95.1, binutils 2.9.5.0.12- compile the kernel, after 12 minutes
of running kernel, monitor turns itself off, like DPMS, even if power
saving is turned off in the bios. There was no way I could find to get
the monitor back on, although switching to console if it happened in X,
it would, or of switching to X from console it would work. Either way,
if you switched back to whatever one it happened in, the kernel would
deadlock. it appears to happen at about 90% of whatever "doze" is set to.
ie, monitor off after 10 mins if set to 12, 26 if set to 30. I got gcc
2.7.2.3 - haven't had the monitor shut off since.
2) deadlocks with basically any kernel. I think this might have been
related to nfs, as I turned that off, and I haven't crashed since, though
it's only been about 16 hours.
