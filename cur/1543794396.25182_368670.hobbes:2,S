I glossed over the pci_alloc_consistent() part of hugh's msg. I
recalled the sound driver from memory. I don't know whether
pci_alloc_consistent()'s sparc-specific usage includes a similar
behavior, but never saw it when I looked for allocators of higher-order
pages that free fragments of them at a time. The audit was far from
comprehensive, though.
I must defer once again. =)
