Ok, then what IS the proper way of accessing the PCI mem space? There
are some drivers (drivers/net/dgrs.c for instance) that just do:
  ulong *ptr = ioremap(physaddr, 256);
  ptr[3] = something;
Others use writel()/readl(), some define their own macros. Is there a
One True Way?
Does one need to worry about caching and cache flushing in case of PCI
mem space? Is that architecture dependent?
