Yeah, certanly not WB_SYNC_ALL, because this is a deadlocky - the process which 
forces write-back from the ->prepare_write() is having page X locked, pdflush 
may have some inode A locked and sleep on page X, while the FS would sleep on 
inode A.

Thanks for suggestion. It sounds as a separate big job to enhance existing 
WB_SYNC_NONE. I've just introduced new WB mode, and it seems to work fine:

My only concern is - what if the page we skipped because of WB_SYNC_NONE_PG 
will somehow loose its dirty TAG and will never be written-back? But it is 
because of my poor knowledge of Linux MM internals. Could you please comment on 
this?
Thanks!
