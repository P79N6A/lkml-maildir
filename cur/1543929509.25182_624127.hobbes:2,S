Hi Andrew,
Here is the instrumentation menu removal patchset, updated to take care of
recent avr32 changes. It has been done on top of 2.6.24-rc4 with the following
patches applied :
[PATCH 1/2] [AVR32] Include instrumentation menu
[PATCH 2/2] [AVR32] Oprofile support
(which have been merged in the avr32 tree by Haavard)
Applying it in the current -mm after the "git-avr32.patch" in the following
order should work fine :
add-kconfig-to-arch.patch
add-have-oprofile.patch
add-have-kprobes.patch
move-kconfig-instrumentation-to-arch.patch
If you have any problem applying them, just tell me. I think there is no
difference between 2.6.24-rc4 + those two patches and your tree in that aspect,
but if there happen to be one, I'll get a -mm tree and do a clean patchset.
Mathieu
