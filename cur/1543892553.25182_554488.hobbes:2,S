No.  You still don't appreciate the problem.
Assume I would change code so that newly compiled programs which use
open, socket, etc generate different references which cannot be
satisfied by old runtimes.  That and only that is something linkers can
see, linkers deal with symbols and references.
If I would do that and people would recompile their existing code this
*still* does not change the fact that the program behavior would be
changed and the code might break.  It can be something as simple as
   int fd = open(...);
   ...
   close(fd);
   ...
   close(STDIN_FILENO);
   open(...);
The last open is supposed to open a new file with descriptor 0 (i.e.,
STDIN_FILENO).  By using non-sequential descriptors this is not guaranteed.
This is nothing you can change with linker magic.  It is embedded in the
code.  It's behavior *guaranteed* by POSIX and Unix before it for
decades.  This isn't anything you can change.

Go back 30 years and convince people to not guarantee first-match
allocation of descriptors.  Then you can stand up and demand purity.
But just as in many other cases, legacy demands its price.  We sometimes
have to pay the price for compatibility and if it isn't high it's worth
it.  I don't say the current proposed code is the answer but iff
Davide's unified code does not perform worse than the current code I
don't see the harm since, for instance, extending socket() is in any
case necessary.  I mentioned that close_on_exit must be set on open,
else leaks are risked.  This will come naturally with a flags parameter
which already takes O_NONSEQFD.
