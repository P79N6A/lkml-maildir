What if (and maybe it is so, or maybe not) the write cache does
write-back (or write-behind) zones per track?  That is, when it
gets a write request either when the cache is not dirty, or is
in the same _physical_ track that everything that is in there
dirty goes into, it gets queued.  Then when some time passes,
or a request goes to a new track, it will write that track now
and move on.  IWSTM this gives you the advantage of "one spin"
writes for sequential data, and still keeps the order right for
journaled data.  Could they be doing this?
