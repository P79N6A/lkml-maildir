Hi Pavel,
> Does nosmp help?
We have not tried. I would expect that it would, but I think that's
changing the system too much, and we cannot do that in production. As we
have seen system run for a couple of months without demonstrating the
issue I think that proving the negative is very difficult. I am focusing
on trying to force the issue so we can gather information.

These do not affect the problem.
Thanks!
Joel.
