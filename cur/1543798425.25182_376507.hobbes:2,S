true - but thats _just one input_ into a complex policy decision
process. The other is clearly VM realizing some type of threshold has
been crossed. The output being a policy decision of what to drop - which
gets very interesting if one looks at it being as fine grained as "drop
ACKS". 
The fallacy in the proposed solution is that it simplisticly ties 
the decision to VM input and the network level input to sockets; as in
the example of sockets doing http requests.
Methinks what is needed is something which keeps state and takes input
from the sockets and the VM and then runs some algorithm to decide what
needs to be the final policy that gets installed at the low level kernel
(tc classifier level or hardware). Sockets provide hints that they are
critical. The box admin could override what is important.
