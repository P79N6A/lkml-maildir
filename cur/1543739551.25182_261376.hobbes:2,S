Its the vesafb-tng patch

Relevant part:
----
        vma.vm_mm = current->active_mm;
        vma.vm_page_prot.pgprot = PROT_READ | PROT_EXEC | PROT_WRITE;
        ret = remap_page_range(&vma, 0x000000, __pa(mem), REAL_MEM_SIZE, vma.vm_page_prot);
        ret += remap_page_range(&vma, 0x0a0000, 0x0a0000, 0x100000 - 0x0a0000, vma.vm_page_prot);

I did it as:
----
        vma.vm_mm = current->active_mm;
        vma.vm_page_prot.pgprot = PROT_READ | PROT_EXEC | PROT_WRITE;
        ret = remap_pfn_range(&vma, 0x000000, __pa(mem) >> PAGE_SHIFT, REAL_MEM_SIZE, vma.vm_page_prot);
        ret += remap_pfn_range(&vma, 0x0a0000, 0x0a0000, 0x100000 - 0x0a0000, vma.vm_page_prot);
