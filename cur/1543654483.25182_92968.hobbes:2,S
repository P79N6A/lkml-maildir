Hello,
after an upgrade of the linux kernel from 2.4.19 to 2.4.20. Some
services are not working:
   - syslog-ng died during boot
   - gdm       no login possible,  on text console a login is possible
No need to say with kernel 2.4.19. all is working fine.
I'm using a Debain unstable:

Timezone
  syslog-ng      1.5.23-1       Next generation logging daemon
  libauthen-pam- 0.13-3         This module provides a Perl interface to
the
  libpam-doc     0.76-8         Documentation of PAM
  libpam-modules 0.76-8         Pluggable Authentication Modules for PAM
  libpam-passwdq 0.7-5          replacement for the pam_cracklib module
  libpam-runtime 0.76-8         Runtime support for the PAM library
  libpam-smb     1.1.6-1.1      Pluggable Authentication Module allowing
Sam
  libpam-smbpass 2.999+3.0.alph pluggable authentication module for SMB
pass
  libpam0g       0.76-8         Pluggable Authentication Modules library
