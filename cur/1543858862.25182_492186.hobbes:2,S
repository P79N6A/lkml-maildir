You know, you could always make it compat for a while, but that requires
approval from Linus I suppose /* heh, heh */
I don't even know if this will compile everywhere,
but I hope you can figure out the idea...
#define ARRAY_SIZE(x) (print_warning(), sizeof(x) / sizeof(*x))
#define ARRAY_LEN(x)  (sizeof(x) / sizeof(*x))
extern ...
void print_warning(void) {
    printk("Don't use ARRAY_SIZE anymore, it will go away\n");
}
