That previous discussion (
http://marc.info/?t=108652857400003&r=1&w=2
)
read the spec wrong and--now that I reread it--failed to address the
original bug report.  In fact it looks to me like the actual bug
reported:
	
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2829
was probably a minor variant of the one which George Davis stumbled on
again here.  That's a little depressing.
> Moving it out of BKL makes a ton of sense,
That would at least reduce the impact of bugs here, yeah.  It would be
great to figure out how to start getting locks.c and lockd out from
under the BKL, but I don't personally have the time now.  (And I believe
there's been a failed attempt or two so it's not completely easy.)
> even adding a "don't check" flag makes a lot of sense.
That's an idea I'll keep in mind, though I'm not convinced it'll help
much (or that applications would actually use it).

Yeah.  I'd still be curious for any data about applications that
actually rely on posix deadlock detection, though.
