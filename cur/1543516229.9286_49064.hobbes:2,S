[snip of removing linux/module.h from ide-features.c include's]
I tried that first, but it didn't appear to be valid simply because
of all the EXPORT_SYMBOL() calls at the end of the file and their
dependency on the macro definition inside linux/module.h... removing
it appears to make the compiler treat the EXPORT_SYMBOL calls as
functions instead of resolving them as macros as needed...

Can these be safely ignored?
If not, it looks like the four components of ide-mod.o (ide, ide-features,
ide-pci, piix, ide-proc) will be continually fighting over this...
it looks like for module-aggregates like this only one can legally have
exported symbols as it stands, so maybe ide-features should simply get
integrated back into ide.c?
Thanks,
James
