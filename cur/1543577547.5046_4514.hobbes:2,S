Even with the obvious bug fixed, that code is strange.  "temp_size >>=
1" does little to improve the chances of the mtrr_add succeeding.
Something like this would be better:
if (mtrr_add(video_base, temp_size, MTRR_TYPE_WRCOMB, 1) == -EINVAL) {
        /* Find the largest power-of-two */
        while (temp_size & (temp_size - 1))
                temp_sze &= (temp_size - 1);
        mtrr_add(video_base, temp_size, MTRR_TYPE_WRCOMB, 1);
}
(But this is just a very crude way to work around the inflexibility of
the MTRRs.  Rather than cluttering up calls to mtrr_add, it would be
better to fix this properly, either by implementing PAT support
(Zoltán Böszörményi said he was working on that), or by having a
user-space helper program to make more intelligent MTRR allocations,
or both.)
