Hmm, okay, I see how you meant it. Yes, it probably could work... but
I'd say it is seriously ugly.
Imagine task waking up after complete image is written... we'd have to
invalidate the image before aborting the suspend.
Actually, we could do better: we could just refuse to run those tasks
after atomic snapshot... and hope we don't deadlock,because the
uninterruptible task holds some important lock... but I still think it
is too ugly.
