As I do not see any reply on this I consider "O(n^2) disadvantage" to
be irrelevant.

We've already agreed to consider unreclaimable resources only.
If we provide reclaimable memory *only* then we can provide any
guarantee with a single page available for user-space.
Unreclaimable resource is the most interesting one.

That's the question - how?

Oom-killer must start only when there are no other ways to find memory.
This must be a "last argument", not the regular solution.
