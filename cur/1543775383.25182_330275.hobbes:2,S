The freedesktop people is already designing a common userspace VFS,
take a look at 
http://freedesktop.org/Software/dvfs
 . At least it looks like
there'll be a common standard, even if the standard is crappy.
Apparently one of the main reasons for DVFS to exist is "POSIX is not
enought for us". 
This approach  is broken by design, having a second-class VFS separated
from the main VFS (what libc functions see, etc) is wrong, IMO.
The Mockup project (they try to bring a BeOS-like API to linux, I think) is
something similar to DVFS but using FUSE.
Take a look at
