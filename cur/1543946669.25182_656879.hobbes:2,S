We have established that the slowdown was caused by TCP checksum errors
and retransmits.  I assume that the slowdown in my test was due to the
light TX rather than the heavy RX.  I am no TCP protocol expert, but
perhaps heavy TX (such as iperf) might not be affected as much because
the wire stays busy while waiting for the retransmit, whereas with my
light TX iSCSI load, the wire goes idle while waiting for the retransmit
because the iSCSI state machine is stalled.
