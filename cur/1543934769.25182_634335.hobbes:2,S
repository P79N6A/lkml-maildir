From the point of view of no overall change: Ack.
From the point of view of whether we should have this in the kernel:
probably not.
See 
http://lists.arm.linux.org.uk/lurker/thread/20071203.131631.85e7a1a5.en.html#20071203.131631.85e7a1a5
for a recent discussion on the ins and outs, multiple formats, options
and so forth passed to mk(u)image.  It looks like we're heading for 5 or
6 different kernel image formats for the ARM architecture. ;(
