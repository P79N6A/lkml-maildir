For the wine app in question, it does make a difference.  However, there is 
a new problem.  The program gets stuck at the loading screen at 100% CPU.
It's making a call to select, timing out, and then tries select again, 
repeats.  It's waiting for something that seems to never happen.
I've captured a log, "loop.log.bz2", and shortened to have only the relevent
information after the CMS32_MUTEX is created.  Look for occurances of
 "select()" -- I think the second one is where it starts.  It's on my ftp if 
anyone wants to take a look.  It probably can be compared to the working-
version log where this doesn't occur, but it might be a pain to spot the 
working particular instance.
