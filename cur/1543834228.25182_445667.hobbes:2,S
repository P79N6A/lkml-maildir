The feature is used, by far the main part of it is just the tagging
itself, not the shared map feature.

If I thought that it would ever be updated to use block tagging, I would
not care at all. The motivation to add it from the Promise end would be
zero, as it doesn't really bring any immediate improvements for them. So
it would have to be done by someone else, which means me or you. I don't
have the hardware to actually test it, so unless you do and would want
to do it, chances are looking slim :-)
It's a bit of a chicken and egg problem, unfortunately. The block layer
tagging _should_ be _the_ way to do it, and as such could be labelled a
requirement. I know that's a bit harsh for the Promise folks, but
unfortunately someone has to pay the price...
