This is inappropriate for ARM - take a look at the ARM Kconfig file
around those lines which you deleted.  You'll notice that ARM contains
some extra options for cpufreq which aren't offered on other
architectures.
These options should appear under the cpufreq menu, and making this
change means that they no longer do so.
