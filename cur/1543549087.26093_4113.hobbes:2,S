Hey, I didn't shoot you, I just want somebody from the SCSI camp to say
something.
Can you test whether changing the
	if (tpnt->present)
		return;
to a
	if (tpnt->present) {
		.. indent the linked list code and the remove_proc_entry stuff ..
	}
fixes the oops for you?

That "request_module[]: Root fs not mounted" message is going to get a lot
more common (and actually get removed) - there's a lot of stuff where we
want to exec a user mode helper, but where the bootup case is special. So
igore that - it's going away, by virtue of making the printk() disappear
;)

Yeah, it's just after the ESP case, getting ready to do the ncr case..
Which will be silent due to not having any controller - until it oopses on
you.
