In general yes the caller should not be thinking about clear_bit having 
any memory ordering at all. However for IA64 arch specific code the bit 
operations must have a certain ordering semantic and it would be best that 
these are also consistent. clear_bit is not a lock operation and may 
f.e. be used for locking something.
