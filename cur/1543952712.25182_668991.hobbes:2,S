Subject: [PATCH] serial 8250: tighten test for using backup timer
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi,
   Thomas Koeller had reported an issue where a device that had been
making use of the UART_BUG_TXEN code in the 8250 driver was mistakenly
being caught by the backup timer test, causing the device to work
improperly.  To fix this, the patch below tightens the test requirements
to enable the backup timer workaround.  The backup timer is really meant
to catch UARTs that don't re-assert the THRE interrupt.  The expectation
is that they do initially assert THRE.  This patch clarifies the test.
Thanks,
	Alex
