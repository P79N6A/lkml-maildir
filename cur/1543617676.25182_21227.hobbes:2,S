Don't worry about it.  Everyone knows (or should know) that you and
Andrea both have the best interest of the kernel vm in mind.  It's
normal for both of you to have strong feelings about something that you
both take pride in.  What would be great would be seeing both of you
come together and really kick some serious vm ass and prove that linux
can compete with any OS.  Maybe you two can come to a compromise along
the lines of "we'll try it your way for a while, and I'll back you, then
we'll try it my way for a while and you back me.  We'll go with the one
that works best for Linux."
I'm sure there are hundreds if not thousands of members on this list
that respect you both and believe that either one of you can provide a
great vm.
I'm behind both of you.
