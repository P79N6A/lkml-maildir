I wasn't suggesting bypassing the vfs helpers; I was only asking what
motivated the approach of substituting a different SID for the
permission checks vs. using a task flag to disable the permission
checking entirely when the module performs an internal access.  The task
flag approach is simpler and avoids the need to set up a label and
policy for the module's internal accesses, which should always succeed
if the module is operating correctly.  The only reason to apply a check
on the module's internal accesses is if you want policy to help
safeguard the module against unintentional access attempts to e.g. the
wrong cache or a file outside of the cache.  And even that is only a
discretionary safeguard wrt the module - it still relies on the module
to not bypass the security hooks and to set the SID correctly for the
cache it wants to access.

I think security_transition_sid() is more appropriate if you use this
approach.

In normal practice, one passes the task SID as the first argument, the
SID of a related object as the second argument, and the class of object
for which you are computing a SID as the third argument.  For program
execution, this takes the form of the current task SID, the executable
file SID, and the process class, and computes the new task SID of the
transformed process.

Yes, upon the next d_revalidate, and it also would affect signal
permission checking and any other permission check against that task.

Unless there is some benefit to setting a ->fssid and checking against
it (e.g. safeguarding the module against unintentional internal access),
I think the task flag approach is preferable.

Zero aka SECSID_NULL is unset.  But a task flag may be sufficient here.
