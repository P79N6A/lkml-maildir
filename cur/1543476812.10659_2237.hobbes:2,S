I missed it too, until I started thinking about all the possible
combinations.

Because then we're back to the old problem: before doing a vfork(),
somebody could do a "clone(CLONE_VFORK)" (which would _not_ wait on the
semaphore like a real vfork() would), and now the wrong child can wake up
the parent and mess up the real vfork().
