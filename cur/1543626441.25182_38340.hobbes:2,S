It has to be EXPORT_SYMBOL. Requiring non GPL drivers to walk pagetables
by hand is pointless. we should definitely recommend those driver
authors to use vmalloc_to_page, in particular if the drivers are not
GPL.
To see it in another way If we make vmalloc_to_page linkable only by GPL
drivers, then we should do the same with all the other functionalities
too starting from map_user_kiobuf etc...
Infact I'm not really sure the _GPL tag makes sense in the first place.
If an interface shouldn't be used by a binary only module, why should it
be used by a GPL module? It doesn't make any sense to me, of course
I'm looking at it from a technical prospective. If your grand plan is to
forbid a non GPL module to call vmalloc/kmalloc/alloc_pages, then the
non GPL module developer will be in great pain I see, but that still
doesn't make any sense to me because the rule is that binary only
modules are legal. Not that I will ever use binary only modules myself,
not that I will ever do anything to help binary only modules, but I
don't either do anything to explicitly hurt them, I just ignore them.
