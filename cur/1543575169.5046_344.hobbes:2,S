I have previously reported this error (about three months ago) on 2.4
with XFree 3.3.6.  If you are running RedHat 6.2, then you are running
this X Server.  It also shows up on Calders'a 2.4 eDesktop.  It appears
to be something with glib 2.1 < versions on 2.4.  I also see it with
secure shell 1.2.27 on 2.4.  I've also seen it on RH 7.0 on 2.4 kernels
as well, but only with SSH.
