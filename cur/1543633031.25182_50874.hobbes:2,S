Someone else said this, too.  I must misunderstand the point of this
file... it is used for compatibility with NEW code in OLD kernels? 
Confusing that we keep it in the NEW kernel, then.  I figured it was
just to keep compatibility in general, or allow OLD code to work in the
new kernels.
If the intention is to use this header with other, older, kernels... and
we really want to keep that in a new kernel... then yes - this bit
should be added back.
