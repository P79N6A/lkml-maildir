I finally got my AVA-1505AE working under Linux, and I thought I'd share my
experience with you.  I got a lot of advice from various people on these
lists, which am very grateful for.  What I finally solved the problem was to
disable the Plug-and-Play features of the card, using the Adaptec SCSISelect
utility. This makes it behave like a legacy ISA card. Then the IRQ must be
configured manually with SCSISelect and the I/O port configured with the
jumper on the board.
For some reason, the 1505's PNP capabilities don't work with my machine
under Linux, even though they work fine in WinNT.
The SCSISelect utility didn't come with my card so I had to download it. It
can be downloaded at 
ftp://ftp.adaptec.com/pub/BBS/hardware/1505cfg.exe,
 or
do a search on 
http://www.adaptec.com/
 for 1505cfg.exe or 1505acfg.exe.  You
need to have an MS-DOS boot disk in order to run it.
Thanks again for all your suggestions.  Hopefully, my experience will help
someone else.  BTW, maybe someone should put this info in one of the HOWTOs.
Anyone know who the maintainers are?  Otherwise, I'd be happy to write up a
little blurb about it.
Thanks,
Geoff Hardy
