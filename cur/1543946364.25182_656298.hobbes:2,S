Hmm, maybe it regressed earlier. Sorry if I blamed you incorrectly.
Anyways at some point this definitely worked. I remember writing
the code ;-)

Sure, but the point is that getting the current node is a common
operation, so it should be a single reference and not go through a 
lookup table.
How it is actually implemented -- through PDA or through you new
equivalent per cpu variables -- does not really matter as long 
as the resulting code is only a single instruction. Using
the lookup array from the cpu number is wrong.
My patch just fixed it back to use the PDA in the old style for now,
but if all your per cpu stuff is merged (I admit I haven't tracked 
if it is or not) replacing that with a per cpu variable would work too
if it then generates the same code as with PDA.
