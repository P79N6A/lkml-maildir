The new thing in this release is MP emulation.
It is fairly experimental at this point.  About all I've done so far is boot 
it with 2 processors and shut it down.  It crashes fairly consistently at 
shutdown time when shutting down Apache.  I don't know whether this is 
SMP-related or not.
The patch is available at 
http://sourceforge.net/download.php/user-mode-linux/p
atch-2.3.36smp.bz2.  I haven't made binaries available yet.  I'll do that when 
I am happier about stability.
When doing "make config", it now asks you if you want SMP.  You should 
probably say yes.  Pass in the number of processors you want on the command 
line:
	./linux ncpus=2
gives you two processors.  Any number up to 32 will work like this.  Beyond 
that, you will need to bump NR_CPUS in include/linux/threads.h.
