Hi Steve,
Unfortuately the nvidia driver means nobody is likely to look
into your problem - it is just not a good use of their time.
It would be very helpful if you could try to reproduce the oops
without the nvidia driver loaded though.
It should be possible if the nvidia driver isn't the cause of
the problem.
