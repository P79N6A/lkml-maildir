  To second Martin Schemmer, it looks like there is indeed something wrong
with threads, probably since 2.6.10-rc1-mm4.
  Apache 2 with the worker (threaded) MPM and NPTL is freezing after some
time with 2.6.10-rc1-mm5 and -mm4. This didn't happen with previous kernels.
  I'm currently trying to revert various patches to find the culprit.
  Best regards,
    -Frank.
