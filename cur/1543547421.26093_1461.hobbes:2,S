Because of my stupidity Linus' reply didn't make it to linux-kernel.
Here it is for those who're interested:

Indeed. It makes sense to have rt_sigqueue() use the same logic as a
normal kill(). I just overlooked it entirely.

A lot of these issues should be fixed in test8-pre2. It does more of a
true job of having shared signals instead of emulating them with a global
"blocked" list and spreading them out to be local signals.
(The "spread out the global signals" approach in test8-pre1 ends up being
fundamentally broken: it has various interesting problems with threads
dying or starting to block signals that they used to not block, and then
we should really give the signal we made local back to the global pool
etc. Nasty.).

Possibly. The problem here is that it makes for very nasty locking.
Right now the thread groups are only known by synchronous threads: other
processes sending you a signal, or you yourself looking at your signals.
That means that they can use regular spinlocks to protect the shared
state.
In contrast, if you start doing the thread group semantics for
asynchronous things like ^C etc, we'd need to change that to
interrupt-safe spinlocks which are much more expensive and have other
nasty properties.
We'll see. I'd like to have people check out the shared semantics, and see
if it works reasonably well for pthreads, and we'll take care of remaining
details after the concept has been proven. 
The shared signals stuff actually ended up being fairly trivial: the most
work by far was the splitting up of functions to simplify the code and
allow re-use of the same stuff for the thread group logic and the single
thread logic. I think most of it is clearer now anyway, but there are some
locking issues still that need to be clarified.
