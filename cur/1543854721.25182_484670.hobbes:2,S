Microcontroller??  Hah!  That'd be MSP430, or AVR8, or an ARM7 ... when
it can run vmlinux, it seems far away from being a microcontroller!
Despite how long it can run on a teeny weeny battery.
You'd like OMAP2 better though, in terms of pin setup it's way nicer.
Each GPIO seems to correspond to a single pin.  Nobody much liked the
consequences of how OMAP1 did it.

Yep; though there _is_ the model of "SOC-on-a-card" plugging into a
custom chassis (maybe an industrial app), as opposed to using custom
boards for everything.  Though if you think of the "board" as being
that whole chassis-plus-CPUcard assembly, it's still more or less
immutable as you described.

That's a big "if".  There's no such "manager" right now, other than the
people designing a given board and putting Linux onto it.

My point was more that it's "not one-to-one".  And clearly a given system
will only use one mapping (Paul's comments aside) ... the issue is that
knowing you're using a particular GPIO doesn't mean you know what pin is
involved, and contrariwise that knowing what pin doesn't mean you know what
GPIO to use.
Yes it's a PITA ... and I've seen boards that needed to get re-spun because
the board desigersn goofed, with two different interfaces expecting to mux a
(different) pin to GPIO7.  Didn't get discovered till late since each of the
two interfaces worked fine by themselves; system integration testing found it.
I suspect that's one reason OMAP2 is different in how it does the pin setup!

Yes, I think we're seeing agreement on that now.

Well, none of the existing software does that, or has needed to.
To the extent that the $SUBJECT calls are just common syntax for
what many platforms are already doing, they all use the same notion
of a "gpio number" which doesn't reference pinout ... there's a
direct mapping to a bit in a gpio controller register, that's it.

They could; the GPIO numbers, and interpretation, are platform-specific.

Who knows.  I thought you were most likely wishing everything was as
simple and straightforward as it is on AT91, AVR32, and OMAP2.  ;)
In the restricted context of GPIO numbers, I think it is.  And it might
even be practical to come up with a widely used pin mux API ... it's
just that significant platforms like OMAP1 would be unlikely to fit.
