I was unable to reproduce the oops by loading tcrypt. All tests passed
and the kernel was fine. I did this testing with Linux 2.6.4-rc3 and
all crypto algs compiled as modules. I will try this again with the
latest linus-2.5 BK tree just in case. Anyway, if you happen to have any
more details from the oops like backtrace or any ideas of what might be
causing the difference in our results, they would be very helpful.
I will also send separate patches once I figure out what caused the oops
with tcrypt.
