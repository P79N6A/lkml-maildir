Yes, the `tsk->delays = NULL;' needs to happen inside the lock.  But the
kmem_cache_free() does not.  It pointlessly increases the lock hold time.

I think it's best to avoid the cast unless it's actually needed to avoid a
warning or compile error, or to do special things with sign extension. 
Because casts clutter up the code and can hide real bugs.  In this case the
compiler should silently perform the conversion.
