Yes, I know this. The [PATCH 15/16] has to switch all the kernel-to-user
boundaries to use the additional helpers. That's the hardest part and
I agree that I could lost something in it.
However, this is relevant only (!) when you clone the namespace. So people
who do not need them won't suffer when this patch set is in mainline.
That's my intention - to make a set that doesn't affect the non-namespace-d
case and go on polishing it. You have already pointed out 2 places. I expect
people to find more of them. This is easier to patch only the boundary to 
the user rather than the whole kernel :)
Thanks,
Pavel
