No.  That is an S3 suspension to RAM.  On the box in question it
generally worked for quite a long while now provided
'acpi_sleep=s3_bios' was passed to a kernel or video would be
unrestorable.  It is Acer Travelmate 230 with i845G video.
I did not try on that laptop suspend-to-disk so far (and in this
moment the damn thing is just plain broken).
