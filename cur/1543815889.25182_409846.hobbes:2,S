That seems quite ok to me.  It is a little weird to have the VMI calls 
be an export when some of them really can never be properly callable C 
functions, and you have to overwrite the native code, so the linking 
step is .. well this magic disassembly glue again.  But it could be made 
to work, and we have discussed it before.

I agree.  But it sort of defeats the point of the GPL if you can 
optionally redistribute the code under the BSD license as well.
