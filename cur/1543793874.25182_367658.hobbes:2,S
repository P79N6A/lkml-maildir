Yes, that's what it looks like now... Note I wrote "wasn't", it used to
look like this:
        if (!rq_all_done(req, nbytes)) {
                end_that_request_chunk(..);
                return;
        }
which of course didn't work, so it was changed to the above which then
broke the assumption of what type of requests we expect to see in
ide_softirq_done(). We can't generically handle this case, so it's
probably best to just add this logic to __ide_end_request() - it's just
another case for _not_ using the blk_complete_request() path, just like
the partial case.
