More likely, people will just re-implement them incorrectly.
However, the rdtsc() definition in the kernel is weird (and removable, I
think there are no more users -- I have it removed in my MSR driver
rewrite tree which I need to get off my arse and push.)  Most users
would expect the rdtscll() functionality with the rdtsc() name.
