That's insane. Are you really saying that ACPI wants totally different 
orderings for different versions of the spec? And does Windows really do 
that?
Please don't make lots of modifications to the generic suspend code. The 
only thing that is worth doing is to just have a firmware callback before 
the "device_suspend()" thing (and then on a ACPI-1.0 system, call _PTS 
*there*), and on an ACPI-2.0 system, call _PTS *after* device_suspend().
Still, the fact is, some (most, I think) drivers *should* put themselves 
into D3 only in "late_suspend()", so if ACPI-2.0 really expects _PTS to be 
called after that, we're just screwed. That's when the system is really 
down, interrupts disabled etc, we don't want to call anything but the 
final ACPI "turn us off" stuff there!
