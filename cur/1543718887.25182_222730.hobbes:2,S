Please forgive my interrupting but am I missing something ...
Would it be possible to define a convention for log entries like with 
keyword expansions in CVS $Log$ and have it include the expected 
brief patch description? Simple, easy and automated but probably doesn't 
work with everyones' version control systems.
Just a thought.
