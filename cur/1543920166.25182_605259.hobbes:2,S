The how/why of the packet rejection probably isn't all that important, but the 
most likely scenario based on the ICMP error code is that the router simply 
does not know about the CIPSO IP option type and is dropping the packet as a 
result.  I'd be very surprised to see a standard router in general use which 
has policy to perform packet level access control using CIPSO options/labels.
