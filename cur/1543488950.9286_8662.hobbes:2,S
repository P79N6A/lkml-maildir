Thank you very much for replying. I did what you told me to do but  received
the following error messages:
make: s: Command not found
make: [lxdialog] Error 127 (ignored)
DLOCALE    -DCURSE_LOC = "<ncurses.h> -c lxdialog.c -o lxdialog.o
/bin/sh:    DLOCALE: Command not found
make: [lxdialog.o]: Error 127 (ignored)
. . . etc, etc.
So far I rebuilt my ncurses for about 5 times, readline for about 4 as well,
binutils, textinfo but have no results. The 'ldd' of my test program is
pointing to a new library (i.e., glibc-2.1).  Totally out of ideas... :((
        Thanks, Alex
