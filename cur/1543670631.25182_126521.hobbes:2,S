I havent booted 2.5.x for a while on this dusty old laptop.
Never had this issue in the past. Have a feeling its some basic
utility that maybe needed.

model name      : Pentium III (Coppermine)
stepping        : 10
cpu MHz         : 696.996
cache size      : 256 KB

128M RAM.
When i run 2.5.68 theres a feel of highly improved interactiveness.
Annoyingly- Starting X takes at least 3 minutes (this is about a factor of
10 worse than older 2.5 and current 2.4.21-pre5. I have tried a few
2.5.6x and they all seem to exhibit this problem. Havent tried going back
beyond that.
I cleared the profile before running X; started X and captured the
profile right after that. Dont know if its any help, but it is attached.
cheers,
