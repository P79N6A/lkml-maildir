Yes, Nigel submitted part of suspend2 here (I do not think he
submitted compression code on that day, for example), but then
http://lkml.org/lkml/2004/9/16/347
came:
#I should mention, I'm planning on producing a BK tree with these patches
#(and ones to fix issues raised), so you won't have to include a long
#list in -mm eventually! It will be on suspend2.bkbits.net (not there
#yet).
That sounds like "don't merge it yet, I'll prepare better version" to
me.

Okay, this one is important. It starts with 
#Hi everyone.
#
#I know that I still have work to do on suspend2, but thought it was high
#time I got around to properly submitting the code for review, so here goes.
That looks like request for review, not request for merge. Plus it was
to: lkml, while it should be to: maintainer (or maybe to: akpm). Well,
it also says "Suspend 2 merge" in subject..

Okay, 11/24 looked closer to submission than I recalled. So I guess I
have to say "sorry".
So we have 1 submission for review in 11/2004 and 1 submission for -mm
merge in 2006, right?
