Use with structures that have an owner field, if you care about 
cross-version kernel source compatibility.

No.  SET_MODULE_OWNER is useful regardless of kernel version, not just 
the restrictive set you define here.  Different vendors may implement 
SET_MODULE_OWNER with a different range of kernel versions, if they so 
choose. It's not restricted at all to when struct net_device gained an 
'owner' field.
Maybe think of it this way:  a source code hook whose implementation is 
free to change, as long as it functionally produces the desired result. 
    The in-kernel definition of the macro is only one of N implementations.
