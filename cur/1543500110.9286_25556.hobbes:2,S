Hello,
I have installed many RH 6.0 machines, using now a kernel 2.2.9-ac6 for
some of them.
I have trouble running tcpdump on my home box (and only on this one) :
'tcpdump -i eth0' or 'tcpdump -i eth1' says :
                        tcpdump: socket: unsupported socket type
I'am quite sure that I have the same .config file here as at work.
The only difference is that my home machine has 2 ethernet cards,
with IP forwarding enabled.
Any clues ?
A+,
