I hope these will split up logically in the future so it's possible to
reply to them without having to do manual mangling..
The patch generally looks fine, this is the only thing that really jumped
out:

asm-generic/pgtable.h already does this if you don't explicitly define
__HAVE_ARCH_ENTER_LAZY_{CPU,MMU}_MODE. So please kill this entirely. If
you forgot to include asm-generic/pgtable.h, that's another matter..
