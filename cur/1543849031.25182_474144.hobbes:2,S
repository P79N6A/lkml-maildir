sdparm is a command line utility designed to get and set
SCSI device parameters (cf hdparm for ATA disks). The
parameters are held in mode pages. Apart from SCSI devices
(e.g. disks, tapes and enclosures) sdparm can be used on
any device that uses a SCSI command set. Virtually all CD/DVD
drives use the SCSI MMC set irrespective of the transport.
sdparm also can decode VPD pages including the device
identification page. Commands to start and stop the media;
load and unload removable media and some other housekeeping
functions are supported. sdparm supports both the linux
kernel 2.4 and 2.6 series.
This version adds support for vendor specific mode pages.
It modifies some exit status values to be the same as
those found in the recently released sg3_utils version 1.22 .
