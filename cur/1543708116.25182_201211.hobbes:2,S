I will acknowledge that while one _could_ code a shell so that your
proposed change would break it, it would be a stupid, silly and ugly
way to code a shell.
That is, one _could_ code a shell to say:
 1) If argv[1] starts with a '-', consume and handle as an option
    (or possibly as a space separated list of options).
 2) Presume the next argument, if any, is a shell script file.
I would be surprised if any of the major shells are coded this way.
