   Yes, to me, too. And to menuconfig and config, but
not to xconfig.
> Please provide more details on how it "doesn't work here":
   You've hit on at least one thing; the problem only comes
up in `make xconfig'; under ``General setup'', there's a
greyed-out selection for ``QSpan PCI'', and everything else
after that that depends on CONFIG_PCI (such as ``PCI device
name database'' 6 fields down, ``DECChip tulip'' and a host
of other ethernet controllers, and FireWire, to name a few)
are also grey.
> Also attach your .config file.
    Well, which one? It doesn't matter whether I start
without one, or with one of mine own, or with the one
that happens to sit in Paul Mackerras' 2.4.0t8 tree...
The one I'm using was made with my hack to arch/ppc/config.in,
so it's probably not relevant, either, but I'll send it anyway.
   I feel like a dork for never thinking to try menuconfig
or even plain ole config, but I guess it needs to be fixed,
anyway.
   Thanks
