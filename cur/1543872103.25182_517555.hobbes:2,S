I think this should be spin_lock_irq().
I have been bitten by lockdep warning in the rcfs patchs. But I think
they should apply here as well.
Essentially, container_task_count() is called from cpuset.c after doing
write_lock_irq(tasklist_lock). This creates the dependency:
	tasklist_lock (irqs disabled)  -> container_group_lock
However in above function, find_container_group (and several other
functions) we take container_group_lock w/o blocking interrupts. An
interrupt handler now trying to take tasklist_lock will cause a
deadlock.
