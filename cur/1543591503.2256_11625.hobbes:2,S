We probably could. It would have interesting semantics however. We would
have to have an ioctl or something else to specify period, and if it's
one shot, etc.
We could probably shoehorn isochronous semantics onto read/write as
well, but I don't want to begin to think how ugly that'll be.
The reason I don't favor the read/write idea for interrupt and
isochronous are the fact that they are so different. We could shoehorn
the semantics onto it, but we'd just be moving the problem from one
place to somewhere else.
A completely ioctl solution would work better in that case since it's
cleaner. The only problem would be the fact it's called ioctl.
