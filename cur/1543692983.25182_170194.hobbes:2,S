I am getting failures like this:
tr.c:81: initializer element is not constant
make[3]: *** [tr.o] Error 1
make[3]: Leaving directory
`/data2/usr/local/src/linux-2.4-pre-aa/net/802'
ecc.c:43: initializer element is not constant
ecc.c:1495: warning: function declaration isn't a prototype
make[2]: *** [ecc.o] Error 1
make[2]: Leaving directory
`/data2/usr/local/src/linux-2.4-pre-aa/drivers/char'
where the problem is a file level definition like
	static var = HZ;
and it seems that HZ is not anymore valid here (see include/linux/hz.h).
I have:
# CONFIG_DEBUG_KERNEL is not set
My gcc is 2.95 (Debian stable/woody).
