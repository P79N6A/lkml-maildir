The point is on the Alpha all ram is always cached, and i/o space is
completely uncached.  You cannot do write-combing for video card
memory.  Memory barriers are a separate issue.  On the alpha the
natural way to implement it would be in the page table fill code.
Memory barriers are o.k. but the really don't help the case when what
you want to do is read the latest value out of a pci register.
