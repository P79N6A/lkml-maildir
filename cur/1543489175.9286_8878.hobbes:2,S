Little/big endian is determined by hardware. It is not a software
issue. Of course one could make a compiler put instructions in any
order, the natural order will be the order in which instructions
are fetched by the CPU from memory. Even if memory fetches are
long-longs, you will have to use what the CPU expects.
Then there is data. Again, the data is aligned and ordered however
the CPU expects it to be. You can't byte-swap and have math operations
on memory oprands mean much.
Suppose you have a magic switch that allows the CPU to fetch instructions
and manipulate data in any byte order. The problem still lies with
hardware. You need perhipherals for screen, disk, network, etc. These
would then determine the byte-order.
Then, suppose your perhipherals had magic switches also. Then what
would you do? Would you arrange the byte-order so 0xdeadface looked
like 0xdeadface in memory on a debugger? If so, you are now just
making a rule based upon preference. Instead, you should make a
rule based upon performance (like network communication).
