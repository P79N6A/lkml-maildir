It's always the same: A process busily reads time, and it wants to have it smooth 
(low jitter, preferrably constant jitter, small time increments):
/*
 * This program can be used to calibrate the clock reading jitter of a
 * particular CPU and operating system. It first tickles every element
 * of an array, in order to force pages into memory, then repeatedly calls
 * gettimeofday() and, finally, writes out the time values for later
 * analysis. From this you can determine the jitter and if the clock ever
 * runs backwards.
