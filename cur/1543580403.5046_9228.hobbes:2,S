How long is the MP structure?
smp_scan_config() reserves only 4 kB:
	reserve_bootmem(mpf->mpf_physptr, PAGE_SIZE);
reserving the actual size (mpf->mpf_physptr->mpc_length) could be
tricky.
It should be possible to dynamically allocate the memory for the busses:
It's not yet possible (smp_read_mpc() is called at a very early stage,
before kmalloc is initialized), but we must move it to a later stage
anyway:
some Compaq bios version need ioremap() in smp_read_mpc(), and we should
parse the ACPI tables for APIC descriptors (MADT, ia64 does that
already).
I'll add it to my TODO list.
