   However the reason I barked was because of you suggesting we remove
   all firmware or should just have left it in there. If we have a GPL
   violation then IMHO it has to be dealt with immediately, then we can
   look at the damages afterwards.
Lack of copyright does not imply "do whatever you want with it".
The plain fact is that we don't know, and I'm trying to say
"it likely is a problem, let's go find out".
I think the QLogic,ISP driver firmware(s) being distributed is just as
serious an issue as the "obvious" qlogicfc_asm.c violation.
