And then all your running daemons have heart attacks.  Why?  Because sendmail 
has glibc 2.0.7x mapped, but doesn't have the DNS stuff mapped, and then
sendmail decides to do a DNS lookup, maps in glibc 2.0.7y's DNS module,
and looses/bounces your e-mail.
(Yes, it was only the test machine, but some people might think it's safe to 
upgrade glibc on a running system from packages - often, it isn't.  It might 
usually work, but occasionally bouncing e-mail is still not good.)
David.
