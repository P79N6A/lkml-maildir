I definitely agree. It's about a couple of months that I'm playing with it
and I have to say that it works great with distributed development. It
basically born with that as the very first design rule. It also look very
stable AFAICS. And, the old collection of shell scripts (that I didn't
like in the beginning) is shaping out toward C code. In three words, I
like it. I cannot compare it to bk because I never used it (not because
of the license, and not even for political/personal reasons, but because I
haven't had any time to do it in the past), and I am sure it still lacks
of some useful features when matched with bk, but the fundamentals are
definitely there.
