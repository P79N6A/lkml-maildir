I've worked out a patch to revert the change that broke things for c7x0:
http://www.rpsys.net/openzaurus/patches/revert_bootmem-r0.patch
I'd be interested to know if this helps your spitz kernel as its gets
c7x0 working again. Obviously the next step is to work out why this
breaks things but reverting it gets my Zaurus dev tree working again
which stops users c7x0 complaining :)
