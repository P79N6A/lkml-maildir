  Hi, all. Version 131 of my devfs patch is now available from:
http://www.atnf.csiro.au/~rgooch/linux/kernel-patches.html
The devfs FAQ is also available here.
This work has been sponsored by SGI.
NOTE: this patch removes more compatibility entries. If you need the
compatibility entries, install devfsd-v1.2.7 which will create them
automatically if you ask.
This is against 2.3.22-pre1. Highlights of this release:
- Support info pointer for all devfs entry types
- Added <<info>> parameter to <devfs_mk_dir> and <devfs_mk_symlink>
- Removed /dev/st hierarchy
- Removed /dev/sg hierarchy
- Removed compatibility entries for loop devices
- Removed compatibility entries for IDE tape devices
- Removed compatibility entries for SCSI CD-ROMs
- Removed /dev/sr hierarchy
				Regards,
					Richard....
