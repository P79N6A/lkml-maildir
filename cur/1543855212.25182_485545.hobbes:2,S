I use RDTSC in get a cheap method of measuring time. What other choices are
there for a low overhead high frequency time source?
By low overhead a kernel call is way to expensive, I want to minimally impact
the code and have many of these calls through out the code. One of the
ways I use it is to instrument multi-threaded applications and then use
the TSC to compare when actions occur between threads. i.e. I use it as a
time stamp counter and neither precision or accuracy is too important.
On the other hand the more precise and accurate the better:)
