The dangerous part is that we change f->f_mode for all open files
without regard for whether there might be any writes underway at the
time.  This isn't *serious* although the results might be a little
strange and it might result in a confused return from write(2).  More
seriously, mark_files_ro() in super.c *only* changes f->f_mode and
doesn't deal with the possibility that the file might be mapped
read-write.  For filesystems that do delayed allocation, I'm not at
all convinced that an emergency read-only will result in the
filesystem doing anything at all sane, depending on what else the
filesystem might do when the filesystem is forced into read-only state.

I agree it is useful, but if we're going to do it we really should do
it right.  We should have real revoke() functionality on file
descriptors, which revokes all of the mmap()'s (any attempt to write
into a previously read/write mmap will cause a SEGV) as well as
changing f_mode, and then use that to implement emergency read-only
remount.
