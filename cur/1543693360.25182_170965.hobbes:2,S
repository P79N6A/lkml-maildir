Here is exactly what it does on IA-32/i686+:
# define lll_lock(futex) \
  (void) ({ int ignore1, ignore2;                                             \
            __asm __volatile ("cmpl $0, %%gs:%P6\n\t"                         \
                              "je,pt 0f\n\t"                                  \
                              "lock\n"                                        \
                              "0:\tcmpxchgl %1, %2\n\t"                       \

                              ".subsection 1\n\t"                             \

                              ".size _L_mutex_lock_%=,.-_L_mutex_lock_%=\n"   \
                              ".previous\n"                                   \

The syscall is still mq_open, isn't it? So it should be __NR_mq_open.
You simply put the ones where you want to implement them directly in the kernel
into syscalls.list (and add sysdeps/generic/mq_*.c stubs; also, mq_{timed,}{receive,send}
are cancellation points according to POSIX 2003, so they need to be marked as such).
Where you need to do some handling before/after the syscall in userland, you simply write
mq_open.c etc. and use INLINE_SYSCALL (or INTERNAL_SYSCALL) in it.
