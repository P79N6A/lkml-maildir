That error is more serious.

This is a low-level hardware error.  It indicates that communication 
over the USB cable isn't working right.  The fact that it occurs 
sometimes but not at other times indicates that some of the hardware 
components may be not-quite within spec.
Have you tried using that mouse on a different computer?  How about 
using a different USB mouse on your computer?
