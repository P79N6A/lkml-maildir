OK.
Aside:
The congestion info really has nothing to do with "queues".  It is actually
an attribute of the backing_dev_info.  NFS should/will be using them, and
NFS doesn't have queues.
What we should have is set_bdi_read_congested(),
clear_bdi_read_congested(), bdi_read_congested(), bdi_write_congested(),
etc.  Some of these are already in backing-dev.h.
Sometime we should add [set|clear]_bdi_[read|write]_congested() to
backing-dev.h and make the block code call them.  And move the waitqueue
stuff in clear_queue_congested() out of the block layer and into, umm, mm/
I guess.  And rename blk_congestion_wait() to congestion_wait() and move it
into mm/ too.
If all of this is done, the kernel would actually link with CONFIG_BLOCK=n.
But none of this has anything to do with your patch, except that we need to
get your patch in fast because we'd like CONFIG_BLOCK=n to work.

bdi_write_congested() is tested in several places.  bdi_read_congested() is
tested in the readahead code too, although I doubt if queues get
read-congested very often.
