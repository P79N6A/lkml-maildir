Nothing in software is particularly unique given the same set of 
requirements.  Unfortunately, none of the local book stores have a copy 
of Networking Algorithmics in stock, so it will be a few days before it 
arrives.  What problems does this approach have?  Aside from the fact that 
it's useless unless implemented on top of AIO type semantics, it looks 
like a good way to improve performance.
