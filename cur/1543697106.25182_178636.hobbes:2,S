It is feature, so you can "extend" your driver later when you decide. Both
config options points to the same sources. In the past there was option
"G100-G550 support" with "Secondary head on G450/G550". Unfortunately 
G450 and G550 users were connecting monitor to the secondary output,
and then complaining that they do not see anything on the monitor.
So now this option is implicitly enabled when you select first choice,
and disabled when you select second one.
Unless you cannot afford about 16KB for secondary CRTC driver, you should
select first choice, as it gives you better upgrade path.
