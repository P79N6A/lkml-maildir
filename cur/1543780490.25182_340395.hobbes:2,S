Hi everybody,
I have a little problem with software suspend 2.1.9.1[012] on 2.6.13-rc[3456]. 
The system hangs on resume if the AC adapter is not plugged in. Everything 
works well if I use 2.1.9.5 on 2.6.12.x or plug in the AC adapter. I've tried 
acpi-20050729 for 2.6.13-rc6 but that did not change anything. The system is 
a Sumsung X10.
Any ideas what could be the problem?
