That's what the "if NFSD" part does, it's added to the expression and so
modifies how NFS_ACL_SUPPORT is selected. If you enable the debug options
in xconfig you can see the generated expression, which is used to
calculate the final value.
While looking at this, I noticed that a bit too much is added, the NFSD_V3
dependency is also added, but it belongs to NFSD_ACL, otherwise it can
also unintentionally turn the bool into a tristate. I'll have to fix
this...
bye, Roman
