Probably not wrt the pthreads lock fail.
The value passed to the daemon are used for information purposes.
The pid is used only to log who is asking for the mount.
The uid and gid are used to find user name and group name and the four
bits of user information are used to set values in the environment for
use as macros within the map.
If the values in the wait request are wrong then we probably wouldn't
even know as few people will be even aware they are available.
