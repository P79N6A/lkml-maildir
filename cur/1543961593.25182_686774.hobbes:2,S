Yes, indeed, thankyou.

OK. This wasn't clear from the log
message for some reason, but it is
said in the above thread.

Very probably, and for that case I
made the patch like this:

Reading the thread, it actually seems
like Michael wanted to submit the patch
much like the aforementioned one of
mine:
http://kerneltrap.org/mailarchive/linux-kernel/2008/1/18/580583
but haven't done so in time, and as the
result, the wrong one stuck in.
But this is never too late to correct, I
hope.
So I see 2 options: either revert the
patch completely, or revert the dependancies
like Michael suggested initially (if I
understand his suggestion right).
Both patches are here, in this thread.
Thoughts?
