Groovy.  I imported them into BK for 2.4 and 2.5 trees, and fixed up the 
merge conflicts (several patch rejections in 2.4.19-pre3), and fixed up 
the arch/i386/config.in.  BK users should pull from
    bk pull 
http://gkernel.bkbits.net/kgdb-2.4
or
    bk pull 
http://gkernel.bkbits.net/kgdb-2.5
If non-BK users are interested in my changes, feel free to grab them as 
GNU patches from
    
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/jgarzik/patches/2.4.19/
    
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/jgarzik/patches/2.5.7/
Are there any other arches that have kgdb stubs I could merge?
