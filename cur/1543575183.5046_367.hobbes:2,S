Well, it is a pretty complex program that I want to measure, with more
than one modules that run one after another... they sleep and use signals
to wake each other up, they use semaphores etc. What I want to measure is
the time the program is running (not waiting for other processes or
waiting for a signal etc). 
Also, there are other processes running on the
system (for example, my program needs about 50 seconds of real time to
execute and I estimate the time it is "running" to be about 5000-10000
microseconds)...
Thanks anyway,
Vangelis
