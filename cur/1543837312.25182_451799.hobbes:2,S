I'm not sure this is true for old LinuxThreads...

Your patch doesn't cure the problem.
rcu_read_lock just disables preemtion and rcu_dereference
introduces memory barrier. _None_ of this _prevents_
another CPU from freeing old real_parent in parallel with your dereference.
You can minimize the probability very much by making local_irq_disable()/enable()
around the code in question, but still it won't be a real fix (at least due to NMIs).
