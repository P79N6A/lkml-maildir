Decoding the first few words to hex, then ASCII gives
sts.pte_spinlock
#define pgtable_cache_size      (pgt_quicklists.pgtable_cache_sz)
#define pgd_
and I it continues.  The defines are from include/asm-sparc/pgalloc.h
and it is possible the first few words are out-of-order frees of indirect
blocks or something.  In any case, were you just untarring a 2.4 kernel
tree at the time of this problem?  That would be a bad thing, since it
would point to a bug still in the 2.4.0 kernel.
Alternately, were you just rm -r an old kernel tree?  Is it possible you
have not fsck'd this filesystem since running one of 2.4.0-test10 through
2.4.0-test12 (or maybe even test13)?  In this case, it is possible that
the filesystem was corrupted with the older kernels, but you just didn't
notice it if it was in an unused kernel tree.
The sequence of events leading to this bug would help a great deal...
Cheers, Andreas
