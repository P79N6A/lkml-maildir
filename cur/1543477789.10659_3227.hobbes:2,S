Nope. You may well have the image but not the config. I've got kernels
stretching all the way back to 1.2.13 2.0.0 2.0.25 2.0.30 2.0.33 2.0.36.
Are you seriously suggesting that i have all their kernel trees, and all
the configs for each of them, for all the variant images I sprayed
around the place? Uh uh.
