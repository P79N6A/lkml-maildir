Sounds like a good idea. If NVS is already aligned to page size, do you
still use the pseudo driver to save/restore the pages? In my system, the
NVS memory is 512k. 
In the other way, we could let the 'swsusp_add_arch_pages' accept
address instead of a pfn and let snapshot.c handle the partial page
issue.

Yes, we can get the amount of memory needed ahead per the e820 map.
