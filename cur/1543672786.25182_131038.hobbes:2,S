Ok, that's fine with me.  Setting it explicitly to NULL is also correct
and perhaps a bit more clear.

Ok, agreed that 2.5 does not need the patch.

I would argue that __make_request() is where the insertion of the buffer_head
into the request structure is performed, and setting the b_reqnext field of
the buffer_head to its proper value is an integral part of performing the
insertion.  Why not keep all of the insertion logic in one place rather than
distribuing it throughout the code and requiring all callers of
__make_request() to remember to initialize b_reqnext?  Localizing the
insertion logic makes the code clearer, more compact, and easier to maintain.
