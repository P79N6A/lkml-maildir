Yet more backwards compatibility is more than likely going to be
needed, but if it is a biggie I'd be happy to drop the older 32/64-bit
stuff from CVS and make it contingent on having 2.6.11 or greater as
it is a new feature anyways and hasn't seen a release yet...

I don't think so as the DRM has its own locking that handles most of
the issues at a higher level... I've been thinking of switching DRM to
ioctl_unlocked but I'd really want someone with an SMP system to beat
on it .. (not that the DRI has a great record on SMP anyways..)
