 Vectors start from 0x31.  That's what IRQ 0 gets.  The interval is 8, so
the following vectors are 0x39, 0x41, and so on.

 Not necessarily -- after reaching the reserved range, i.e. 0xef, the
allocation wraps around to the previous base plus one.  So for the second
pass vectors start from 0x32, for the third -- 0x33, etc.
