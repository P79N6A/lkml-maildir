Subject: 2.6.24-git12-ext4-1 patchset released
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

I've just released 2.6.24-git12-ext4-1.  It removes the ext2/ext3 BKL
patches from Andi Kleen, since akpm has apparently already merged those
into -mm and they were causing conflicts with Dave Hansen's read-only
bind mount patches.  
It also adds a patch to replace the use of iget() with iget_unlocked()
(since an iget() removal patch has been queued in -mm), and adds a
number of bug fixes. all, of which I hope to push to Linus shortly.
