	No. You have no readdir() and no random access to files. You have
no directory hierarchy. _If_ you are going to produce such a monster -
start from learning CODA. But I'ld rather recommend to start with FTP -
web _really_ doesn't provide anything close to filesystem semantics. And
read the RFCs - one of the archives is on ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/
