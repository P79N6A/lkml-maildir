Thing is, the rest of the kernel uses virt_to_phys for
two different things.  Only one of them has to do with
the real physical address, the other is about getting
the page frame number.
On native x86, x86-64 and others, the page frame number
and physical address are directly related to each other.
Under Xen, however, the two are different - and the
AGPGART really needs to have the physical address ;)
