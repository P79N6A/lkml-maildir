Clearly you have no idea what's going on, or how development is done. 
These are mutually exclusive different ideas on what constitutes an 
optimal scheduler, and not in any way improvements on the same thing, 
but total replacements for the algorithm of the scheduler.
And Ingo has been doing scheduler work for a very long time, while until 
recently Con was working on the staircase scheduler as a solution for 
desktop use, and it was not (to my taste) a candidate for a general 
scheduler until the deadline discussion and some ideas from wli resulted 
in improvements resulting in more robust performance under typical 
server loads.
You also seem to be unaware of the work done by Nick Piggin in 
nicksched. There are a lot of mutually incompatible approaches being 
evaluated, and that's good for the future.
