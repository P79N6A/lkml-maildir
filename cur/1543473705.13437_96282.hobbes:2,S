Can be fixed with
HAS_586OPTION := $(shell if $(CC) --version 2>&1 | grep -q 'egcs'; then echo
y; else echo n; fi)
if $HAS_586OPTION = "n"; then
    HAS_586OPTION := $(shell if $(CC) --version 2>&1 | grep -q '2.8'; then
echo y; else echo n; fi)
fi
if $HAS_586OPTION = "n"; then
    HAS_586OPTION := $(shell if $(CC) --version 2>&1 | grep -q 'pgcc'; then
echo y; else echo n; fi)
fi
