Hi,
I found a bug on the 2.4.0-test8 release:
I was not able to build linux-2.4.0-test8 on my dual PIII box if I did NOT choose the "smp support".
Here is the compile error message:
/usr/src/linux/include/linux/kernel_stat.h:48: `smp_num_cpus' undeclared (first use in this function)
/usr/src/linux/include/linux/kernel_stat.h:48: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
/usr/src/linux/include/linux/kernel_stat.h:48: for each function it appears in.)
I think the simple fix is to check "#ifdef CONFIG_SMP" in this kstat_irq(int) routine.
I could compile the code just fine if I choose the "smp support".
Best regards,
Hao Xu
