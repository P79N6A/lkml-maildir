We have  a host bridge (plus PIC, mem ctlr, etc.) that is essentially
identical
for ppc and mips.  Where is the best place to put the code since we
don't want to
duplicate it for both architectures?

that this nation under God shall have a new birth of
freedom, and that government of the people, by the people,
