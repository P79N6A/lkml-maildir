And there is nothing in the license that says that this has to be done. 
Claiming that it is a requirement because of the "spirit" of the license or 
that such was the "intent" of the license does not make it any less legal 
than it is. And, as I've taken the time to explain to you, lacking any clear 
statement, written at the exact same time as the license, a statement of 
intent or spirit cannot have any real legal weight when the text of a license 
is finally decided upon. The reason, in case you missed the mail in which I 
gave it, is that the author *cannot*, no matter the belief anyone may have in 
their honesty or the oaths they may swear, be trusted to have *not* changed 
his/her mind as to the intent and/or spirit of the license at any time after 
the license goes into use.
