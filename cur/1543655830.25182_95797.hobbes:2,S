99,95+% of the computer users base out there tend to differ. This
makes your point rather moot :-) (To me, the "OS" consists at least of
the kernel, c standard library/ies with their support files and enough
infrastructure to start programs without having to hard code them on a
kernel boot line or in code. Which is at least /sbin/init and might
even contain a simple user command shell).
This definition could fit on a floppy, though. Might even fit on an
720k diskette. :-) Kernel + /sbin/init + busybox is IMHO an OS.
If you define "OS" at the syscall layer you end up with what we
started.  Two threads printing 1 0 1 0 1 0 on your screen.
