     Taking it out may kill backwards compatability.
     #ifdef all the offending bits with
     #ifdef TOO_CLEVER_FOR_ITS_OWN_GOOD
     #endif
     And then the paranoid can leave it in, while the people who find it
     mortally offensive can leave it out.
     I screamed bloody murder when this crackpot idea was first
     implemented, but, alas, it's in now, and even the grotty things in
     the standard kernel should remain.
