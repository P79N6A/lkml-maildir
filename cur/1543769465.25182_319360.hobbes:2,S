Sure, the only reason I made it visible was because of the comment in
there:
# CONFIG_JBD could be its own option (even modular), but until there are
# other users than ext3, we will simply make it be the same as CONFIG_EXT3_FS
I don't really have a preference either way.

It's a generic mechanism for userspace driven configuration of kernel
functionality. There's nothing specific to OCFS2 about it. Other kernel
subsystems/projects could use it too, for their own configuration
mechanisms. More details are in configfs.txt, which is included in the
above patch. Note the example used in the documentation text is an NBD
driver.

Yeah, there's some stuff that that scripts catches. Thanks.
