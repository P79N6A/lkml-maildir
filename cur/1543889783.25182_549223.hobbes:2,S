don't you mean the vice versa:
first use to scheduler, then VCPU (which is essentially a runqueue or rbtree),
then a task from VCPU?
this is the approach we use in OpenVZ and if you don't mind
I would propose to go this way for fair-scheduling in mainstream.
It has it's own advantages and disatvantages.
This is not the easy way to go and I can outline the problems/disadvantages
which appear on this way:
- tasks which bind to CPU mask will bind to virtual CPUs.
  no problem with user tasks, but some kernel threads
  use this to do CPU-related management (like cpufreq).
  This can be fixed using SMP IPI actually.
- VCPUs should no change PCPUs very frequently,
  otherwise there is some overhead. Solvable.
Advantages:
- High precision and fairness.
- Allows to use different group scheduling algorithms
  on top of VCPU concept.
  OpenVZ uses fairscheduler with CPU limiting feature allowing
  to set maximum CPU time given to a group of tasks.

how did you select these 40%:60% and 30%:70% split?

So if 2 VCPUs running on 2 physical CPUs do accounting the have to update the same
user X accounting information which is not per-[v]cpu?
