Ok.  I guess I was thinking of VIPT, but by now I am just guessing :)

That is an incomplete explanation, because it should never be possible
for reads to access data from the write buffer which isn't the most
recent.  That would break ordinary programs which don't have alias mappings.

Don't some of the ARMs executed two instructions concurrently, like
the original Pentium?  The simple test is only valid if a
store/store/load sequence is guaranteed to pass through the buggy part
of the pipeline in exactly the same way, no matter which programs it
appears in.

Fwiw, PA-RISC shows a similar problem.
