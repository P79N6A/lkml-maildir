Just a "heads up" because I haven't found reference to this in the ia64
nor kernel lists.  Maybe just happens on my platform?
I'm seeing this on an HP rx8620 [16xIA64, 4 NUMA nodes, 32GB], booting
subject kernel.  Log excerpts:

Eventually the boot hangs...
I did a bisection search of the mm4 broken out patches and isolated the
problem to the "export-cpu-topology-by-sysfs" patches.  I.e., if I
comment these out, builds and boots fine [with a one-liner build fix
from Christoph Lameter for an SGI sn pci source file].  Something
overstepping a slab allocation?  Still investigating.

Lee
