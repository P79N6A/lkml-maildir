Ok, as far as usage scenario goes, that's fair enough. But as to the
solution, I wonder though whether it's making life more complicated than
it needs to be. After all, we should also be able to cope okay with
having the power suddenly go out. If we can cope with that, cleaning
filesystems prior to suspending should be a non-issue.
Likewise with changes in hardware. Once hotplugging support is mature,
suspending, switching around hardware and resuming should just result in
hot[un]plug events.

Nigel
