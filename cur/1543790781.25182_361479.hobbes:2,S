Check if the address passed, 0x561329b0, is very different from addresses
passed during regular operations. The error the kernel returns basically
says that this address is bogus, which it might be, but if more or less the
same address worked previously chances are that the kernel is confused
Switching to/from NPTL might very well change the address btw.
Good luck.
