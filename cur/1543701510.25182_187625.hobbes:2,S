Yep, in fact when I wrote the above message, I came across a couple when I
was pondering...
* the destructor runs in a more predictable context.
* given the problem that started this thread, the 'if' test is a
  potentially problematic area.  Why not eliminate all possibility that
  this problem will occur again?
The only counter argument to this -- to which I have no data to answer --
is that there may be advantage to calling __kfree_skb immediately
instead of deferring it slightly.  I didn't think that disadvantage
outweighted the above, but who knows...  I can possibly be convinced
otherwise.  (and "otherwise" would be using || irqs_disabled())
For the users who don't know/don't care about their context, it just
seemed to me that they were not a hot path like users of dev_kfree_skb()
and dev_kfree_skb_irq() [unconditional] are...
