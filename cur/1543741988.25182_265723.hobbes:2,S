This still applies cleanly to 2.6.10-rc1-bk6, so I'm building it to 
test also.  I have an Olympus C-3020 that mounts as a vfat file 
system over usb.  It has been somewhat of a problem if the card has 
quite a few pix on it, I must copy, and delete, from the bottom of 
the dirlisting else it goes read-only on me.  When the build is done, 
I'll try mounting it to see if this also gives an Oops, then reboot 
and try again, and report the results.
