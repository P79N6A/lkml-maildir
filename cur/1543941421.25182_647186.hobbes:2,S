No, I just missed another place with timeout:
                /*
                 * Wait 5s total for a response
                 */
                for (timeout = 0; timeout < 5000000; timeout++) {
                        if (cpu_isset(cpu, cpu_callin_map))
                                break;  /* It has booted */
                        udelay(100);
                }
