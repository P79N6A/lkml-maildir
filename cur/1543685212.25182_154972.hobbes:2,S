Here's a quick fix that will at least correct the i82365 probing.  It will
be interesting to see what effect it has on these other problems.  Note
that this driver needs some work with check_region etc.
[PCMCIA] Fix PnP Probing in i82365.c
pnp_x_valid returns 1 if valid.  Therefore we should be using !pnp_port_valid.
Also cleans up some formatting issues.
