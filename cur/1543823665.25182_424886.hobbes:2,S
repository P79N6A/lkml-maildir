You're right.  My initial BUG() problem was on pre 2.6.11.  I wrote this
patch and tested that it worked on 2.6.16 to allow the test program I
described to run successfully.  Admittedly this is the first time I
tested on unpatched 2.6.16 and as you said the mlock will fail with
"Invalid Argument" instead of BUG().  So the panic is gone post 2.6.11,
but the problem remains.  We still are rounding incorrectly for
hugepages in the sys_mlock and do_mlock functions.
This patch still solves the problem of the kernel currently being more
restrictive on what we accept from userspace for the length of the mlock
if it is a hugepage rather than a regular page.  With a regular page we
will round the value from userspace and happily go about our business of
mlocking.  For a hugepage it just rejects it if userspace doesn't align
it themselves.  This allows the kernel to do the same work for hugepages
that it does for normal pages.
