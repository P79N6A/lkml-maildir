Character devices in general.
And what's pretty nasty is that some interfaces force BKL still, so
not even new code can opt out.

I had some patches for those.

[had some patches for "fasync_locked", not sure if it's worth it]
- character device open
That's a nasty one. Either open_unlocked or a special cdev_init?

I tried to recruit kernel janitors some time ago to just do all the
ioctl -> ioctl_unlocked/explicit lock_kernel changes. There were a few
patches generated but the effort died down then.
BTW for ioctl the dynamic instrumentation method proposed also won't
work because it's basically impossible to exercise all these ioctls
