What if you intend to use something like:
   atomic_inc(lock);
   /* Do something */
and the /* Do something */ is moved _before_ the atomic_inc(lock)? For this
to be of any use in this way, you'd need the atomic_inc() and its ilk to
act as barriers. So it depends on the use to which they are put (or are
intended to be put).
