Thanks.

It could be caused by that, definitely. slab debugging plus my earlier
patch may help to narrow it down. (or stress testing with / without the
dvb card in action).

OK. Don't put too much effort into memtest if it hasn't caught anything
by now -- it's really only exercising your CPU and memory, so even if it
is your video hardware, it probably won't find the problem.
