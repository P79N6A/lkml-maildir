Read that as regulator_ops.disable() ... although there are
issues with regulator_disable() too.   $SUBJECT patch relates
to regulator_ops semantics, which of course bubble up.

Would you say that also for regulator_ops.disable() though?

Very confusing refcounting.  The naming convention is unusual too,
and that's just the start of it:
    struct regulator_dev ... unique handle to the hardware, has
	some real refcounting (use_count), and is what shows
	up in /sys/class/regulator (vs. say .../regulator_dev).
	This class is internal to the regulator framework.
    struct regulator ... opaque client handle, wraps regulator_dev,
	but has no refcounting:  just a boolean 'enabled' flag,
	and KERN_CRIT messaging if you try using enable/disable
	like you would with clocks or IRQs (N enables are fine,
	so long as they're eventually paired with N disables).
	Each "consumer" would normally have its own "regulator".
Less surprising/confusing would be if regulator_{en,dis}able() did
its own refcounting and called down to regulator_dev when changing
a per-client refcount to/from zero.  (Easy patch, for later.)
And, hrm, kerneldoc for regulator_is_enabled() says it returns
a refcount, not boolean; but the refcount is unavailable to the
regulator_ops method returning that value.

Seems to me more like a three input OR gate.  No counters.  ;)
At least, if you ignore the additional arbitration between
ACTIVE, STANDBY, and OFF modes.  (Highest one wins...)

That answer doesn't make much sense to me; plus, kerneldoc
for regulator_get_mode() -- which essentially just calls down
to regulator_ops.get_mode() -- says it returns the "current"
mode.  NOT some potential future mode.  Giving the "current"
mode implies asking the hardware what it's doing right now.
Consider also the scenario above, where Linux calls enable()
and has requested STANDBY mode.  The regulator will instead
be in ACTIVE state; answering STANDBY seems quite wrong.
(Just like answering STANDBY when it's really OFF...)

In a general sense, yes ... but this framework splits that
state into a "mode" and an "enable" flag (called "state" in
sysfs, which doesn't reduce confusion at all).

Mine is to have get_mode() report the actual hardware state,
matching kerneldoc ... and thus the $SUBJECT patch.  Also, I
have no set_mode(), and thus no mode "requested by the CPU"
through this framework.

But *which* actual state?  I'd say that reporting this CPU's
enable/request bit *is* reporting actual hardware state:  the
request line managed by regulator_ops.disable()/enable().

True; the coordination here is done in hardware.  There
are "scripts" that get downloaded into the hardware, and
which update things on various hardware state changes.

Makes sense.  Record "requested_mode" in "struct regulator_dev"
and expose a new sysfs attribute for it.  Should I update
the $SUBJECT patch to do that too?
