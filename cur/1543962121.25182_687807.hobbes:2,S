Yes.

No, I don't want to do this. I know someone who is, and I wanted to get
more input before I advised them to get more disks. The RAIDs are running
in degraded mode, so they'll need more disks anyway. Since they are (or
hopefully soon will be) buying more disks, I'll advise them to get
dedicated disks for each RAID.
