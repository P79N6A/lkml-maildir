I find that the following works fine:
#ifdef DEBUG
#define DEB(f) f
#else
#define DEB(f)
#endif
code.....
DEB(printk("Lots of stuff, %s, %d, %d, %d\n", string, int0, int1, int2));
In this case, if DEBUG is defined, printk() with its variable-length
parameter list is compiled.
If not, nothing is compiled, everything inside DEB() is simply ignored.
This means that the macros do not, themselves, have to handle variable-
length parameter lists. The preprocessor only handles text as it was
designed to do.
