Subject: firewire: fw-ohci: ignore failure of pci_set_power_state (fix suspend regression)
Fixes (papers over) "Sleep problems with kernels >= 2.6.21 on powerpc",
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/8/25/155.
  The issue is that the FireWire
controller's pci_dev.current_state of iBook G3 and presumably older
PowerBooks is still in PCI_UNKNOWN instead of PCI_D0 when the firewire
driver's .suspend method is called.
Like it was suggested earlier in 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/10/24/13,
 we
do not fail .suspend anymore if pci_set_power_state failed.

Update:
  - omit comment which will become outdated if the underlying problem is fixed
  - log the error return value
  - document the actual bug in the patch description
IMO the actual bug here (operating the controller while it is in
PCI_UNKNOWN state, which is surely a fault in the PPC platform code) is
something to be fixed post 2.6.23 release.
