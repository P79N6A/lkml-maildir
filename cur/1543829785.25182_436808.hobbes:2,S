I'm thinking we should remove __read_mostly.
Because if we use this everywhere where it's supposed to be used, we end up
with .bss and .data 100% populated with write-often variables, packed
closely together.  The cachelines will really flying around.
IOW: __read_mostly optimises read-mostly variables and pessimises
write-often variables.
We want something which optimises both read-mostly and write-often storage.
 We do that by marking the write-often variables with
__cacheline_aligned_in_smp.
OK?
[Problem is, I don't think any of the make-foo-__read_mostly patches
actually identified _which_ write-often variables were affecting `foo', so
we'll be back to square one.]
[Actually, we should do
	#define __write_often __cacheline_aligned_in_smp
and use __write_often
a) for documentation and
b) so the optimisation can be centrally turned off, for space
   optimisation or for performance validation.]
