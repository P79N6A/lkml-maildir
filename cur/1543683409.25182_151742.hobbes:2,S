Okay, so the debate is not over. It looks like his internet connection
only works as long as you keep flaming him -- perhaps he has frozen
ethernet cable? :-)
Anyway, patrick seems to have his own "linux-power" tree, and thinks
that his "linux-power" tree will help powermanagment in Linux. I don't
think that is the case, but I'll provide split patches *once*. Then
I'm going to post each new patch (I guess I'll cc: patrick), but
cumulate them for submission to Linus. Patches will be marked [PM]
(read it as Pavel Machek or Power Managment).
I hope that works for everybody.
