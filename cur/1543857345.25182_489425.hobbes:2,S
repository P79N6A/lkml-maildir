__attribute__(()) perhaps, which is often seen in kernel code.
   -fno-gnu-keywords
       Do not recognize "typeof" as a keyword, so that code can use this
       word as an identifier.  You can use the keyword "__typeof__"
       instead.  -ansi implies -fno-gnu-keywords.
Ergo it's a GNUism/GCCism. As long as <whatever> is used in kernel code, 
it should be documented.
