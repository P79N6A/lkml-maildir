that's not the right level; since that is per interface. And you only
know the actual interface waay too late (as per earlier posts).
Per socket.. maybe
But then again it's not impossible to have packets for one socket go out
to multiple interfaces
(think load balancing bonding over 2 interfaces, one IB another
ethernet)
