Not out-of-the-box, I guess. There are likely no aliases in the kernel
modules which match the hardware for these old drivers. You could put
them in a modprobe config file maybe.
What's in the module? What does:
  /sbin/modinfo <kernel module name> | grep alias
print?
And what does the hardware say? What does:
  grep . /sys/bus/pnp/devices/*/id
print?
