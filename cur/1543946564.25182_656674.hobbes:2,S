Ah. This /proc behaviour of having multiple formats for reporting the
same kind of data (compare with /proc/meminfo, which does use colons)
is the kind of thing that I want to avoid with cgroups. i.e. if two
cgroup subsystems are both reporting the same kind of structured data,
then they should both use the same output format.
I guess since /proc has both styles, and memory.stat is the first file
reporting key/value pairs in cgroups, you get to call the format. OK,
I'll zap the colon.
