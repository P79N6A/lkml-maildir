Just finished installed the latest kernel.  Anyway,
alsa seems to work fine with my onboard soundcard (Via
8235 on an Epox Motherboard). Arts on the other hand
isn't working properly at all.   Rather than sound, I
get a load of static noise.  Xmms, Mlayer etc.  work
fine with the alsa plugin, but crash if using the arts plugin.
