Hmm, I looked around at libfs and debugfs yesterday...  it seems that
the simple_attr_read as used by fops_u8 would have been great for
seclvl - except that -1 is a valid input for seclvl  :)
A more specialized per-type API in security/security.c in the line of
debugfs/file.c might be good,simple_attr_read as used by fops_u8 would
have been great for
seclvl - except that -1 is a valid input for seclvl  :)
The general type of API provided by debugfs/file.c might be useful in
security/security.c, though, provided that the securityfs_create_int()
and friends also took a function pointer to an update() or validate()
function.  I'll try to do something like that later today or tomorrow.
thanks,
