Me too.  There are two advantages to tracking things down so the BIOS
calls work.  1) BIOS calls are always the best source for what the
capabilities of the machine are.  2) If enough glitches are shaken out
of the system I can put in a boot sector loader, and people can boot
windows.  And that is the really killer feature, because then you can
replace GRUB and lilo.
In my optimized setup I put on LinuxBIOS, which simply provides a
table of values to the kernel.  Which I can requery all day long
without problems.  And I suppose that has me spoiled :)

Definitely that is where the policy is.

Yep.  I checked up on that one, a few bug hunts ago...
Also the BIOS normally reserves that memory as well, and linux
honors the BIOS reservations as well.
What has me currently baffled is that I have an old 2.4.17 kernel,
that is dying in the decompressor.  But if I bypass the 32bit startup
code and substitute in my own, the kernel works.
I don't know yet if this is common or not.
I guess the next step is to work on a reliable means of skipping the
16bit kernel startup code.  I do that all of the time with mkelfImage,
so it should not be too bad.  
But getting good parameter values can be a challenge if the original
boot sector values are not saved.  At the same time all I really need
to preserve reliably is the memory size.  The kernels seems to work
o.k. without dummy values for everything else.
I guess those will be my next two steps, a debugging checksum, and 
the option of entering the kernel in 32bit mode.  I already have a
rough memory map that I check the kernel against to make certain it is
being loaded to a valid memory location anyway...
