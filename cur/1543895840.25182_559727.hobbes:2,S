Right is not the same thing as ability. You have a technical ability
which has been converted in a "right" which in turn is used as argument
to reject GPLv3.
But did the original conversion happened with the approval of everyone
having rights to the result? I think not.
All the "GPLv2 didn't think of DRM therefore DRM is GPLv2-protected"
arguments make me sick. If tomorrow Ford starts mass+producing flying
saucers will they be exempt from traffic regulations because current
traffic regulations only consider cars? I think not. Yet the same
argument is the core of most GPL v3 objections we've seen in this
thread.
