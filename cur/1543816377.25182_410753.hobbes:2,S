If you use sendpatchset:
  
http://www.speakeasy.org/~pj99/sgi/sendpatchset
with the gmail SMTP server "smtp.gmail.com" you can send patches from
your gmail account without tab destruction.
The documentation for sendpatchset is within the script.  Grep for
'gmail' in the script to see where to hack in your gmail account and
password (low tech configuration ;)
