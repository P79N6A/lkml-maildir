You can cache the results in userspace. So I don't see this one as an
argument for making the kernel more complex.

How do you ensure consistency now? And how is that different from an
userspace process reading the whole directory hierarchy into cache in
one go?
The update-on-write to special file thing seems bit strange to me. What
if two processes ask for it at the same time?
