None whatsoever.  Three people are reporting this and it's a drop-dead
showstopper for a 2.6.21 release so we just have to wait until someone
wakes up and thinks about it.
It would be very useful if one of the reporters could perform a git-bisect
search to identify the offending change, please.
I would dearly like to point you at a document or web page which describes
kernel-git-bisect-for-newbies, but afaik there isn't such a thing, which is
a huge failing.
