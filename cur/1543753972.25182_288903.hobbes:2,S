Did you try another version of glibc?

That's certainly correct.

You emphasized the differences of the effects. But there is one reason in
all cases which I know: int10 crashes X or even the whole kernel.
I could debug the problem to the following point:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
static int
vm86_rep(struct vm86_struct *ptr)
{
    int __res;
#ifdef __PIC__
    /* When compiling with -fPIC, we can't use asm constraint "b" because
       %ebx is already taken by gcc. */
    __asm__ __volatile__("pushl %%ebx\n\t"
                         "movl %2,%%ebx\n\t"
                         "movl %1,%%eax\n\t"
                         "int $0x80\n\t"
                         "popl %%ebx"
                         :"=a" (__res)
                         :"n" ((int)113), "r" ((struct vm86_struct *)ptr));
#else
    __asm__ __volatile__("int $0x80\n\t"
                         :"=a" (__res):"a" ((int)113),
                         "b" ((struct vm86_struct *)ptr));
#endif
/* Comment from me */
xf86MsgVerb(X_INFO,3,"my comment\n");
            if (__res < 0) {
                errno = -__res;
                __res = -1;
            }
            else errno = 0;
            return __res;
}
#endif
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
I could see, that X crashes in glibc 2.3.4 with kernel 2.4.x (not with
kernel 2.6.x, x <= 10, x > 10 not tested) during the first malloc syscall
after int10 to execute the function
xf86MsgVerb(X_INFO,3,"my comment\n");
The crashes depend on different versions of used software:
glibc 2.3.3 or 2.3.4 with kernel 2.4.x
glibc 2.3.2 with kernel > 2.6.9rc2
I asked a X developper, but he couldn't help until now, too.
I can't say, if glibc or the kernel could be the problem. You can't relate
it reliable neither to glibc nor to the kernel nor to X. Therefore, it
_seems_ to me, nobody really cares about the problem.
I'm willing to help to find the problem - but I'm neither a kernel
developper, nor a glibc developper nor a X developper. I'm depending on
the support of the developpers.
I think, there should work one developper of each application together to
find the problem. I could ask a X developper, which I know, if he is
willing to help to find the problem together with a developper from the
kernel and from the glibc (I don't know, who to ask from the glibc-team).
Kind regards,
Andreas Hartmann
