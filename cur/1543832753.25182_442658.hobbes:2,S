Create a file in /etc/udev/rules.d. Add to it the following.
# devfs-ify vt devices
KERNEL="tty[0-9]*",  NAME="vc/%n"
Now John's names are broken.
As Alan's wisely pointed out, it's utterly insane to try to "fix" a legacy 
file when it a) can never match all possible, legal, current configurations 
and b) shouldn't be used for anything important anyway.
It'd be better to CONFIG out this directory and see what breaks. Then we can 
decide if we should (or provide distributors the option to) remove it.
