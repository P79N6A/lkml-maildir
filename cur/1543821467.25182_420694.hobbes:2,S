yes, but this information unfortunately cannot be passed 
to the kernel, assuming that we 'preserve' the original
mount flags, as there simply is no 'atime' flag, just an
MS_NOATIME flag, which in this case is not set :)

it's full of worms, maybe we should add a new option or
even a new mount type for this?
maybe we should allow remount on bind mounts, and keep
the original (copy all) behaviour intact for --bind and
--rbind mounts? (that would look most natural to me)
suggestions welcome!
