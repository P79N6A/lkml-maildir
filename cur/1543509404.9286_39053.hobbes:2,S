Yes.

Very likely.

How about looking at the actual chip on the motherboard?  Given the make
and model, it should be fairly easy to write a small utility to adjust the
settings (provided we can get the datasheet).  In fact, I've seen one --
if you're very lucky it will match your chip. (Check out the linux-parport
archives for that; I think it was a couple of months ago now.)
