agreed, this would work too and it has the advantage of working with the
mirrors too as far as the per-file updates are atomic (should always be
the case). This has the only disavanage of forcing the client and the
server to read all file contents (I normally don't rsync with -c). But
if it simplifies life a lot, it's sure acceptable.
