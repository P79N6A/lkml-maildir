The two are no different. Someone at cisco stuffed an IP authentication
header in the TCP frame. Its stupid, but the RST argument is not a real one

Ditto the TCP bad MD5 sum and a tcp checksum error.
I've actually got a more constructive suggestion for the zebra folks. 
Route the BGP crap through a netlink tap device, mangle and unmangle the
tcp frames in luserspace. Saves doing TCP in userspace, saves screwing up
Dave's nice networking stack.
You'll still need to kill SACK support to make it fit
