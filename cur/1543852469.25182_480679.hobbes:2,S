Well, I've got some data from earlyprintk (forgot I needed to boot with
vga=normal).
Unfortunately, I had to rewrite the trace manually:
clear_IO_APIC_pin+0x15/0x6a
try_apic_pin+0x7a/0x98
setup_IO_APIC+0x600/0xb7a
smp_prepare_cpus+0x33a/0x371
init+0x60/0x32d
child_rip+0xa/0x12
[And then the unwinder said it got stuck.]
RIP is reported to be at ioapic_read_entry+0x33/0x61, which according to gdb
is:
0xffffffff80271418 is in ioapic_read_entry (include/asm/io.h:204).

Tomorrow I'll try a serial one, but now I must get some sleep (I can hardly
see anything).
