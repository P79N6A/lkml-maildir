Hello,
I'm a linux vet, but am relatively new to kernel compiling.  I'm trying to 
trace a nasty bug, and I wish to build incremental kernels of the 2.2 tree. 
I'm looking at ftp.kernel.org in the v2.2/testing directory, and have a 
question about the directory setup.
Can someone tell me, what is the difference between patches in the "incr" 
directory and patches in the "old" directory?
In pub/linux/kernel/v2.2/testing/incr/ I see files such as:
patch-2.2.19-pre1-pre2.gz
whereas in pub/linux/kernel/v2.2/testing/old/ I see:
patch-2.2.19-pre2.gz
My objective is to start with the latest 2.2.17 sources and patch it up to 
specific levels, e.g., 2.2.18-pre3.  Do I use patches in "incr", or patches 
in "old"?
I'm guessing that "old" patches will take me from 2.2.17 to version
2.2.18-pre-"N" without needing to go through the previous N-1 patches first, 
but that patches in "incr" will only take me from one patch level to the 
next higher level (from 1 to 2, etc).  They appear to be smaller patch 
files.  Is this right?
Thanks for your time,
Russ Fink
