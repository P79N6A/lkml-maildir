There seem to be some hiccups in what changes to kernel source
will get remade by simply repeating   make bzImage   after doing
some minor tweaks. It seems that build libraries check as 
current even if .c files they depend on have been modified.
I did a separate little jig to override that, rather than
any change to the source dependancy structure. 
Specifically, I was twiddling printk's in fs/super.c, and
it seems that for the changes to percolate up to the new image 
fs/super.o, fs/filesystems.a and fs.o have to be removed,
and perhaps vmlinux and the stuff in arch/bla/boot/compressed
I therefor cobbled up the following...
...........................................................
rm -v vmlinux
rm -v arch/i386/boot/bzImage
rm -v arch/i386/boot/compressed/bvm*
rm -v arch/i386/boot/compressed/piggy.o
rm -v */*.a
rm -v */*/*.a
rm -v */*/*/*.a
rm -v fs/fs.o
...and some "note to self"'s
.........................................................
That's just a CQD shop version, of course, but I think something 
like this is definitely missing. This one works for fs/setup.c,
probably most other stuff, and it seems a general one is quite 
possible.
The only good debug cycle is a 0-time debug cycle. 
I wouldn't really put this in the Makefile, myself, in spite of 
my Subject: line, but that's a whole 'nother soapbox.
