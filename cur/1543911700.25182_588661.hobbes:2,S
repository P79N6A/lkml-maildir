Seeing this patch ignored two or three times already,
I tried to make as non-intrusive change as possible,
thus maximizing the chances that it will be applied.
Come on, this patch saves 60k-90k of text, or 30-40% of driver size.
This is ridiculous to have such enormous bloat.
In the functions I converted there are no non-static functions
which are not declared in a .h file.
There are indeed functions which are used only in one .c file:
ahc_check_cmdcmpltqueues: aic7xxx_core.c
ahc_get_sense_bufaddr: aic7xxx_core.c
ahc_hscb_busaddr: aic7xxx_core.c
ahc_inq: aic7xxx_core.c
ahc_outq: aic7xxx_core.c
ahc_pause_bug_fix: aic7xxx_core.c
ahc_sg_bus_to_virt: aic7xxx_core.c
ahc_sg_virt_to_bus: aic7xxx_core.c
ahc_swap_with_next_hscb: aic7xxx_core.c
ahc_sync_qoutfifo: aic7xxx_core.c
ahc_sync_scb: aic7xxx_core.c
ahc_sync_tqinfifo: aic7xxx_core.c
ahc_targetcmd_offset: aic7xxx_core.c
ahc_update_residual: aic7xxx_core.c
ahd_assert_modes: aic79xx_core.c

ahd_update_modes: aic79xx_core.c
Converting them to static may save additional 3 or 4k,
if gcc will be smart enough...
I, too, have many questions regarding this driver:
why __inline? why u_int?... and who's maintainer, btw?
