No, it doesn't. Just tested on 2.6.10-rc2-mm3 (vanilla) and nothing wrong
happens. I can plug and unplug the USB flashram stick, and again, and
again, and everything stays fine.
On 2.6.10-rc2-mm3-RT-V0.7.32-2 I get trouble after the first time I unplug
the thingie. From then on I rather not touch it back again ;)
Take care.
