Or, you have power related problem.  Try to rewire the power lines or 
connect harddrives to a separate powersupply.  It's often useful to 
change one component at a time and watch which change the problem 
follows.  Anyways, you seem to be suffering transmission failures, not a 
driver problem.
Thanks.
