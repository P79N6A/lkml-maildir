Is Cachefs (Solaris has this) available on Linux ?!! 
As far as I know cachefs on Solaris works only for CD-ROM mounts and NFS. 
How useful would it be to extend this as a generic feature from the VFS layer 
itself ?! 
What I mean is, one could mount any filesystem type with the Cache flag turned 
on, and this behaves as a  cachesf, i.e copies happen on a copy-on-write basis. 
One another thing - if I had a CD-ROM, I could mount that as a Cachefs with 
write permissions, whereas actually any writes would only create copies in the 
file-cache. Wouldn't it be pretty useful if I had a CD already cut and now I 
need this one file on the CD to be changed for some reason. Atleast to 
user-level programs it would appear that the file was modified on the CD - 
quite useful when you want to modify a large source base on a CD, but don't 
want to copy the entire stuff on to your hard-disk. 
Any comments ? 
Thanks 
Deepak
