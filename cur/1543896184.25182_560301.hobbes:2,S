so?
Not GPL related, but casino machine software that needs to be approved
by the casino regulation office in Argentina need to provide source,
compiling instructions AND binaries, and the binaries must pass a diff
check. This is impossible without a hacked compiler since the
timestamps WILL differ.
Just an example that legality doesn't always comply with itself, and
even less make sense.
