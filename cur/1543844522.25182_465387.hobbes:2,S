I mostly agree with Stephen. I agree with both the approach of modifying
SELinux so that its task security blobs chain to yours, and I agree with
the suggestion of letting Stacker do it. I also suggest you consider the
inverse stack of making your module stack with SELinux instead of vice
versa (chain in the opposite order) and I suggest you consider making
your module stack with AppArmor.
The only part I question is why you would need to wait for your module
to start development on any of these approaches. Especially the Stacker
approach.
On that point, now that LSM is staying, and there are a multitude of
modules proposed for mainstream, perhaps it is time to reconsider
merging Stacker. There was a *lot* of effort invested there benchmarking
various schemes. With multiple modules coming in, and stacking a
recurring problem, perhaps we need it now.
