Hmm, well they don't use groups, but I guess they can be excluded,
because if the parent span is the same as the child span (and that
is true at this point), then SD_WAKE_AFFFINE/BALANCE in the parent
will never be executed. Good point.
wake_idle should be doing a similar thing too, but that needs a bit
of work.

I guess we should think about it. It depends - does SD_BALANCE_FORK
make sense on a plain SMP machine? If so, then it probably makes
sense to be in the 'SMP' domain on a NUMA system, otherwise not.
I suspect that for BALANCE_FORK, the answer may be no. On an SMP, it
is far less disastrous to misplace tasks and have them picked up by
the periodic rebalancer. What's more, BALANCE_FORK does add a non
trivial overhead when moving tasks to other CPUs.
But it's open for debate. I haven't done comprehensive tests.
