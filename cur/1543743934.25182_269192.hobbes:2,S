Doesn't. Please see attached logs.
RT-V0.7.19-dmesg_after_boot_rl3.log is a freshly booted dmesg output after logging on via ssh.
RT-V0.7.19-proc_acpi_TAB.log is captured via netconsole. This log started after logging in locally,
then typing in "cat /proc/acpi", then first <TAB> gives an additional "/", 2nd <TAB> gives no visual effect, 3rd <TAB> produces whats in the log.
thanks,
Karsten
