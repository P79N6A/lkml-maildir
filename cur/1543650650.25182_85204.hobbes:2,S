Just stupid idea. Two or three months ago I complained that if
my box crashes shortly after boot, following things happen:
(1) system for some reason reads /var/run directory to page cache
(2) fsck finds that /var/run/* entries points to invalid nodes, and
    removes them (through block device access)
(4) / is remounted read-write    
(5) because of page cache for block device and directory is not
    coherent (or what...), system still sees /var/run/* populated
(6) rm /var/run/* is run. FS is remounted read-only due to
    freeing inode already freeed...
(7) Reboot, run fsck again, reboot, fine...
    
Nobody answered it at that time, and it happened at least 5 times
again to me - until I modified initscripts to do unconditional
reboot if "fsck /" did ANY modifications to filesystem.
Maybe kernel still uses old directory indexes structure after
fsck created new one?
