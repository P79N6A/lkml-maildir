Hi,
I have a Toshiba Tecra S1 laptop with a built-in ethernet card which
uses the e100 driver.  The ethernet works fine with linux kernel 2.6.3.
As of 2.6.4 (and 2.6.5) I get the following message at startup:
e100: Intel(R) PRO/100 Network Driver, 3.0.17
e100: Copyright(c) 1999-2004 Intel Corporation
PCI: Enabling device 0000:02:08.0 (0000 -> 0003)
PCI: Setting latency timer of device 0000:02:08.0 to 64
e100: eth%d: e100_eeprom_load: EEPROM corrupted
e100: probe of 0000:02:08.0 failed with error -11
and the ethernet no longer works.  (The 2nd last message eth%d is
probably missing the ethernet number as a parameter to this printk)
Please cc: me in replies since I am not subscribed to the list.
Let me know if there is anything I can do to help fix this problem.
Thanks,
Bernt.
