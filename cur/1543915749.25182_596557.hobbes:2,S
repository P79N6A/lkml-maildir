Head still spinning.
a) "rtc0" != "rtc" ??
b) The kernel is trying to register two procfs files of the same name! 
   If that's a configuration error then we have a Kconfiguration bug.

We're relying on procfs behaviour to prevent registration of two rtc
devices?  That's a strange means of arbitration.   And what happens
when CONFIG_PROC_FS=n?

No.
What I mean is that we cannot change procfs as you propose until we have
located and fixed all places in the kernel which can cause duplicated
procfs names.  (Good luck with that).
Because we've had this happening before, and *the driver kept working*
(apart from, presumably, some of their procfs features which, presumably,
nobody used much). 
With the change which you propose, these drivers will probably stop
working, because they will newly find their procfs registration failed.

I'm not sure that anything _has_ changed.  It's just that a few people have
suddenly noticed duplicated rtc entris in /proc.  Perhaps theye were there
for some time.

A driver which checks the return value from procfs registration and which
then errors out (as it should) if that registration fails.
