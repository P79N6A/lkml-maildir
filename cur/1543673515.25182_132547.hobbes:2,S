Not the above - that one is obvious that the key can be compromised.

This one...
Though part of it has to do with large systems and crash. What is done
on some of these systems is to periodically checkpoint batch jobs. If the
kernel crashes, the job has a physical memory failure, a cpu dies (one out
of many...) the system resumes processing (after reboot, or removing the
memory page from the valid list ... whatever recovery method) to then
reload/resume the processes.
If the random key is lost due to a crash, then reload/resume fails.
