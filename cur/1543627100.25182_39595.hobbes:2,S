Weird problem: perl can't read file's atime if fs is mounted noatime!
Was found during Mozilla 0.9.9 build.
Verified to be related to mount -o noatime (i.e. it works fine on
normally mounted fs)! Can you imagine this?
See 
http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=136123
for full story. Abridged version:
Was getting perl errors in config/make-jars.pl:
===============================================
        unlink $destPath;       # in case we had a symlink on unix
        copy($file, $destPath) || die "copy($file, $destPath) failed: $!";
        # fix the mod date so we don't jar everything (is this faster than just jarring everything?)
======> #vda: my $atime = stat($file)->atime || die $!;
        #vda: my $mtime = stat($file)->mtime || die $!;
        #vda: utime($atime, $mtime, $destPath);
        return 1;
    }
    return 0;
}
=========
Commented offending lines (those with #vda: above).
This helped.

>I faintly recall a kernel option to disable atime
Yes! This is it. I mount all my filesystems -o noatime.
But how can this be related? Build process should never pay
attention to atime. Only mtime/ctime is important, right?
Nevertheless, I'll enable atime update and report back.
(this means tomorrow, I'm playing with 0.9.9 at home, not here)

Only test script. Have to compile 2.5.7 at home to test mozilla.

atime is standard, thats ok, but using atime in build process
is _logically_ wrong. Remember make? It compares *mtime* of
source and target files in order to decide which target needs
rebuilding! atime is _irrelevant_.

I tried that at home:
noatime mount + fresh configure+make, got an error.
normal mount + fresh configure+make, everything is ok.
(2.4.16 kernel, had no opportunity to try 2.5.7 -
was compiling KDE 3.0 at the same time and having some sleep)
Tried to look into perl sources (there are a handful of stat*
files) but since I don't know perl, I was scared by ugly syntax
and ran away. YMMV. :-)
