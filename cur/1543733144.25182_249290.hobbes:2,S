  Yes, we have several VFS versions. KDE and Gnome has their own, mc
  another, and so on. None is compatible with the other and all data
  is unavailable if you do not use a program specifically coded to use
  the particular VFS you stored the data with.

  Why? No one has to use it. you do not have to load FS/VFS plugins so
  you can extend the functionality of your filesystem with stuff like
  compression, encryption, sorting, filtering, etc etc..
