I'll second that.  Google is probably the closest thing to Microsoft's Knowlege 
Base that Linux has for quick questions ;) .
There are a number of good books written on the kernel - Linux Device Drivers is 
due to have its third edition released in February.  I'm glad - my second edition 
copy is starting to look a little ragged from constant reference.
Check this website:
http://www.dit.upm.es/~jmseyas/linux/kernel/hackers-docs.html
It has a good listing of on- and off-line resources, and was updated recently.
