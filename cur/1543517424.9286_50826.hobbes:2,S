as long that there are no real BIOS problems (mentioned by Alan Cox),
I think the best is to break up long operations in smaller ones.
( check rescheduling after n MByte of data has been copied or so ..)
James, can you please explain what exactly the "accel wrapper" is.
sorry for my ignorance :-)
I think 64bit transfers will not elimitate latencies, it will only lower the
latencies
by factor 2 (ideal case), but that might not be enough for the hardcore latency
folks, especially the realtime audio folks.
Benno.
