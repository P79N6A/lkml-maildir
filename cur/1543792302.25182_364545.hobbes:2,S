Thanks for the feed-back.

Hmm.. This (and a similar one with ->issue_flush_fn) would be a lot
harder to unwind, but it is also much more benign.  These sorts of
calls should always be very shallow.
I don't think there is anything useful that can be done here, and I'm
not convinced there is a real problem.
It is worth noticing it and keeping it in mind though.
Thanks,
NeilBrown
