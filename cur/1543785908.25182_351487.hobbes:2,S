Not quite.
The default timeslice of nice 0 tasks is 100ms. The timeslice is not altered 
the way you have read sched.c. It is altered thus:
1. For 'nice' levels it varies from 5ms at nice 19 to 800ms at nice -20.
2. For interactive tasks, it is cut up into smaller pieces down to 10ms and 
round robins with other tasks at the same dynamic priority, but still is 
based on the nice levels for the full length of cpu time before expiration 
overall.
