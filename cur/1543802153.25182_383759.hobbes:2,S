Since ALSA 1.0.9 (alsa-lib and alsa-driver > 1.0.9 required) no special
configuration is required to get software mixing to work for i815 (and
other chipsets which lack hardware mixing), with a few exception like
ICE1712 and ICE1724 where a more complex configuration was required due
to hardware restrictions.
You should never have to touch an .asoundrc file to get software mixing
to work, if you do it's a bug.
