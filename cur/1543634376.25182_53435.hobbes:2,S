Ok I can run -dj2, but I cannot use X 8-( although this time no BUG or panic.
I got these errors during boot:

Jun 19 23:22:20 gandalf kdm[259]: Display :0 is being disabled (restarting 
too fast)
and whem starting X with startx:
<X startup messages>
XIO:  Fatal IO error 104 (connection reset by peer) on X server ":0.0"
      after 0 requests (0 known processed) with 0 events remaining.
when X is starting I see the normal 'flash' as the screen resolution is 
adjusted but the screen remains black and then the console returns.
same box (SIS and MGA)
