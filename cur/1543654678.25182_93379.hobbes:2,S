I've updated my patchset to resync with 2.4.20
Included:
O(1)
Preemptible
Low Latency
AA VM addons
ALSA
Supermount
XFS
ACPI
optional rmap
and an ugly low latency disk hack (can be turned off during config)
In a slight departure from the direction I started taking towards the end of 
the 2.4.19 patchset I am only including patches that are known to be safe and 
reasonably well tested.
A split out patchset is available.
Get it here:

Cheers,
Con
