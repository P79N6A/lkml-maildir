I would like to respectfully disagree with this some. The kernel needs
to abstract hardware to some degree for userspace. The problem in this
case is that userspace can't really do a better job, in fact it can
only do a worse job since it lacks the coordination capability of
knowing it has full control of all the hardware registers. 
I am sure the corner cases you're talking about are nasty, I just don't
think they are less nasty when dealt with in userspace. Sure the kernel
might be simpler, but the system as a whole sure is not.
