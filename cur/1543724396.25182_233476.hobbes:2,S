So how about pushing for writing (i == 1) if i is boolean, to be
clearer?  It's often nice to be able to tell whether a boolean
variable is strict 0/1 or just zero/non-zero, when you're thinking of
switching to 3+-state logic.  But guess what, i == 1 is far less
efficient than i != 0 on many architectures.  It's an unfortunate
trade-off you have to make in this case.
