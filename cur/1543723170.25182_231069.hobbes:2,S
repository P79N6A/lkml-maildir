I'm seeing the same thing after upgrading to 2.6.7-mm4, 2.6.7 vanilla
does not exhibit the problem.
Also Azureus (Java Bittorrent client) crashes when it tries to open a
network socket to begin downloading. Again problem does not exist with
2.6.7.
I'm going to try a few other kernel versions to see if I can find when
this started.
