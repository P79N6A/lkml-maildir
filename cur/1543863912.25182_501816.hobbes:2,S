You're thinking of MMIO, while the case we were discussing was PIO. My
laptop is perfectly happy to assign PIO resources from zero.
The claim that "zero is disabled" is a relatively new (and IMO broken)
thing, and doesn't seem to be universal. This bizarre new special case
certainly isn't shared by the PCMCIA code, for example, which is quite
happy to put devices are PIO address 0...
shinybook /root # cat /sys/class/pcmcia_socket/pcmcia_socket0/available_resources_io 
0x00000000 - 0x007fffff
shinybook /root # dmesg | grep 'max PIO'
ata2: PATA max PIO0 cmd 0x0 ctl 0xE bmdma 0x0 irq 53
ata2.00: CFA, max PIO4, 500400 sectors: LBA 
I believe PCMCIA just uses the generic resource code, which also seems
to lack any knowledge of this hackish special case for zero.

So again you end up in a situation where zero is a strange special case.
It works sometimes (setup_irq()) but not other times, and has meaning in
some places but not others. Once we go tickless and I start playing with
the PC speaker audio driver again, that hackish special case is going to
be fun to play with, I'm sure.
And your IRQ numbers no longer match the labels on the IRQ lines in the
hardware documentation; you have to have some 'mapping', which should
ideally be used for user-visible displays of IRQ numbers too.
That doesn't really sound much like the 'CLEANEST SOURCE CODE' to me. 
Programmers do seem to cope with comparing file descriptors with -1.
Counting from zero is quite normal. But would you suggest that our "zero
is invalid" policy should extend to those too, just in case our kernel
hackers can't manage? Obviously userspace programs will still expect
stdin to be fd #0 but glibc can fix that up for us -- it can handle the
"should be translated in some way" requirement of which you speak, so
that we can have the special case which seems to be permeating the
kernel.

Really, it doesn't make the code cleaner when you have to add a whole
layer of translation just because of a single misguided special case.
The "special case" of NULL isn't really a special case because we just
refrain from _mapping_ that page. We don't actually treat it any
differently.

I look forward to pretending the world is little-endian and

It doesn't need to be per-architecture; it can just be -1. The only
reason it was per-arch before is because some architectures were using
zero and someone considered it easier to #define NO_IRQ rather than just
making it consistent.

No, Linux is better than that. We tend to use models which encompass the
PC and other systems, and we're actually quite good at it.
The argument falls down a little more when we observe that our
assumptions about zero aren't necessarily valid on a PC either. On a PC,
IRQ0 _is_ valid, and the current code is inconsistent and confusing.
Even the PC needs some hackish "IRQ mapping" if we actually put our
money where your mouth is and make the code self-consistent by doing
something like this:
--- a/kernel/irq/manage.c
+++ b/kernel/irq/manage.c
@@ -220,7 +220,7 @@ int setup_irq(unsigned int irq, struct irqaction *new)
        unsigned long flags;
        int shared = 0;
 
-       if (irq >= NR_IRQS)
+       if (!irq || irq >= NR_IRQS)
                return -EINVAL;
 
        if (desc->chip == &no_irq_chip)
PIO address 0 is also valid on a PC -- assuming you have the NO_ISA bit
turned off on any PCI bridges in the path. And even on a PC I've
sometimes had to manually clear that bit in order to get PCMCIA resource
assignment to work. 
PCMCIA resource assignment can be hard enough already without
gratuitously throwing away a perfectly valid location on the grounds
that we've lost the ability to use zero. 
This is a computer. We count from zero.
