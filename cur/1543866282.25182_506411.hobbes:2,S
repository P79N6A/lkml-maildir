I think ip_vs_control_cleanup() should also do flush_workqueue() after
cancel_rearming_delayed_work().
This is ugly, because we have flush_work() but can't use it on delayed
works. This is possible to change, but not so trivial.
Andrew, do you think it is worth to tweak delayed works so it would be
possible to use flush_work(dwork->work) ?
Oleg.
