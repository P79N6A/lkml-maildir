I don't need to rename them, I need them to stay put, or have some kind
of control over which NIC becomes eth0 and which NIC becomes eth1.
This makes me wonder about running Linux on large systems. How do you
make sure that if you have 2 NICS and you populate PCI slots 3 and 2,
what happens when you add another NIC in slot 0? Do the devices shift?
How do you get them to stay put?
What about SCSI cards? Does logical volume manager software tolerate
LUNS moving around when SCSI interfaces shift?
It seems there needs to be better control over this, something like
path_to_inst in Solaris?
