Hello world,
I'm trying the brand new conservative governor on my p4 2.66 laptop
("Intel Pentium 4 clock modulation" only), it doesn't work at all (my
cpu does not scale).
cat cpufreq/conservative/sampling_rate_max
2755359744
cat cpufreq/scaling_max_freq
2666600
I don't get this...
ondemand governor works fine as usual.
TIA
