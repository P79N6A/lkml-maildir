Ran into a weird bug today in the latest kernel (2.2.10).. I've been
running 2.2.5-15smp for a while now (came with RedHat 6), and finally
decided to upgrade (I'm hoping the networking bugs I hit are fixed).
Anyway, when I reboot into 2.2.10 the kernel halted at the line listed
below.  Can't figure out why, I compiled everything into the kernel that
should be there.  This computer doesn't quite support LBA mode, and my
harddrive's 5.1gb, so I'm using a bootdisk with LDLINUX.SYS.  Anyway,
here's the line (note that this log is from my 2.2.5-15 kernel, since I
can't write to disk on the 2.2.10.  I'm pretty sure they look exactly the
same, though.)

 hda: (computer freezes here)
In the 2.2.5-15 kernel, that last line reads "hda: hda1 hda2 hda3" (as it
should).
fdisk dump:
Using /dev/hda as default device!
The number of cylinders for this disk is set to 10585.
There is nothing wrong with that, but this is larger than 1024,
and could in certain setups cause problems with:            
1) software that runs at boot time (e.g., LILO)
2) booting and partitioning software from other OSs
   (e.g., DOS FDISK, OS/2 FDISK)
Command (m for help): p
Disk /dev/hda: 15 heads, 63 sectors, 10585 cylinders
Units = cylinders of 945 * 512 bytes

/dev/hda3           282     10585   4868640   83  Linux
/dev/hda3 is my boot partition.  /dev/hda1 is for experimental stuff, but
I mount it manually so it can't be causing this mess.
