Subject: [2.6.15-rc2-mm1] Disabled flatmem on ppc32? (ARCH=powerpc)

There is a Kconfig problem for ppc32 in the latest -mm kernel.  It  
seems that somehow the Kconfig logic for selecting memory models  
under ARCH=powerpc doesn't quite get it right for standard flatmem  
ppc32 systems.  When I look at the memory model selection, I only see  
sparsemem, whereas on a normal -rc2 kernel, I can see both flatmem  
and sparsemem.  This somehow triggers a #error where the number of  
reserved bits is less than the number necessary for the sparsemem  
layout (because we're on a 32-bit arch without the address space for  
sparsemem?).
Cheers,
