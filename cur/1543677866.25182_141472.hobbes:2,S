Applying this ontop of 2.5.72-mm1 causes more xmms/mpg321/ogg123
skipping than with plain -mm1 here. make -j20 on my up athlon 1900+ with
512M ram causes extreme skipping until the make is killed. With plain
-mm1 I may get _one_ skip at the very begining of a song during make
-j20 (about 50% of the time). Plain -mm1 stops skipping after 10-15 sec
of playback of a song, and even switching desktops after that doesnt
cause skips, with or without make -j20 running (switching to/from
desktops with apps like mozilla, evolution etc. will cause skips during
the first 10-15 sec of a song regardless what I do it seems).
Renicing xmms to -15 doesnt change anything with either kernel.
