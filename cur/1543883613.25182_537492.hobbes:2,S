Hi,
I am NO WAY confused about what is causing what - I only wrote down what I say trying to compile 2.6.21-git2!
Once again, and for the last time definitely, even if you do not want to perceive what goddamn crap you have produced, Mr. Piepho:
If I want to compile drivers for a specific card ( let us call it Pinnacle PCTV SAT or TwinHan DST - just to mention two examples ) I
a. need to say yes to VIEDO_V4L1
b. CANNOT deselect dvb-pll.c (Generic pll) exactly knowing that the PCTV SAT or the TwinHan DST DO NOT need dvb-pll.c.
c. am trapped by still existing exported symbols like "dvb_pll_lg_tdvs_h06xf" in backend module dvb-bt8xx.c (line 614), which have never been a problem before this catastrophic rollback caused by you, Mr. Piepho!
d. do not see any chance to get rid of static dependencies connected with dvb-pll.c because your work is reactionary and a regression, nothing else.
Conclusion:
Linus, I would appreciate you to rip this stuff out of git2, as long as there is no compromise solution that I can live with.
This work, done by Mr. Piepho is very buggy, and buggy stuff like this does not belong into mainline.

YUP. And as long as this is not finished this stuff has absolutely no place in mainline vanilla. Basta!
All you need is to offer a possibility to deselection for dvb-pll.c for cards that never neede it! As lang as you cannot offer this or do not want to offer this there is no place in mainline for that crap work.
The dvb_attach() system worked almost perfectly optimized ( as far as RAM consommation is concerned) for me and a couple of other cards, until you Mr. Piepho, came up and offered this utmost regessive work.
It is a shame that buggy stuff like this can reach the mainline. When I first saw it I could not trust my eyes.
But seeing the complete personal situation @ linuxtv.org - well: Who wonders??
Anything is possible, even if its quality is horrible.
Uwe
