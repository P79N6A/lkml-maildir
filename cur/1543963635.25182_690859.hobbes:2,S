This isn't a problem for hex_asc_{hi|lo} obviously, just the
hexchar_to_int function, I've been looking at making this available in
another way due to its similarity to simple_strtol etc (akpm noticed).
So the hex_asc_hi/lo helpers are probably useful as-is.  I'll make
sure to note the effects on gdb as you've pointed out when I send
out the revised usage.
Cheers,
Harvey
