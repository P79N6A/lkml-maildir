Yes.  Having thought about it a bit more, maybe zone order IS what we
want if we desire the remainder of the zone from which is was taken
[ZONE_MOVABLE-1] to be reserved for non-movable kernel use as long as
possible--similar to the dma zone.  I had made the non-movable zone very
large for testing, so that I could create a segment that used all of the
movable zones on all the nodes and then dip into the non-movable/normal
zone.  If I used a more reasonable [much smaller] amount of kernelcore,
the interleave would have worked as "expected".  
Of course, I don't have any idea of what is a "reasonable amount".
Guess I could look at non-movable zone memory usage in a system at
typical or peak load to get an idea.  Anyone have any data in this
regard?
