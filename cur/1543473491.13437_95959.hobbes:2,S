	Will this tulip.c from 2.0.36 workk "as is" with 2.1.x/2.2pre?
Maybe I'll try putting the NetGear back in my machine and see if tulip
0.89H causes my machine to spontaneously reboot again. I'm currently using
2.1.131-ac10 (with some sound patches) on an old SMC/WD 8013 ISA ethernet
card and it's been running great for almost 2 days straight. 
	I too, am not happy with the idea of sticking with v0.83K for
kernel 2.2.0 as it completely does not work on the Lite-On PNIC cards, and
true blue DEC Tulip cards are getting hard to find if you're buying new.
Then again, I'm still within my 30days of receiving the new NetGear card
-- maybe'll just return it with a note that it doesn't support Linux ;-)
