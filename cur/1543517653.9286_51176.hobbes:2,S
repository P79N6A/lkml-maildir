Thanks - works great now!
I am now only getting +/-1msec scheduling jitter on a heavily
loaded system.  I am not using the console on the system so
I expect thats why I havent seen any latency problems there.
Can the console changes from the lowlatency-2.2.10-N6B.patch 
be applied to 2.2.13 with fixups for rejects or is it more
involved than that?
