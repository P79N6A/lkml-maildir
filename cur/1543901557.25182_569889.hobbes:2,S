Could you please stop with these accusations?
Could you please point me to the mail with the separate answer?

Which are quite big, so I skipped most of it, a more precise pointer would

Huh? What has this to do with HZ? The scheduler used ticks internally, but 
it's irrelevant to what the user sees via the nice levels.
So the question still stands that this change may be a little drastic, as 
you changed the nice levels of _all_ users, not just of those who were 
previously interested in CFS.
