Yeah, page->index is used along with vma->vmpgoff and vma->vm_start to
determine the address of the page in the given vma:
  address = vma->vm_start + ((page->index - vma->vm_pgoff) << PAGE_SHIFT);
and from that address the pte can be found by walking the vma->vm_mm
page tables.
So page->index does what you want it to, identify which part of the
framebuffer this particular page belongs to.
