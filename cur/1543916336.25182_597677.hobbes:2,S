PPC would do just fine with 32-bit as well, which is what I wanted in
the first place. I just went with the local coding standard of pcmcia
and switched to kio_addr_t.
I suppose it's a janitorial todo item but with the maintainer MIA I
don't want to mess around with it too much, since I can't really test
much besides the PPC stuff I have.
As for the formatting/padding widths: Some platforms had ioaddr_t's
that were 32 bit already, so it was already broken on those, and the
only drawback is missing 0-padding. It'd look a bit silly to pad to 16
0:s anyway at the moment, so I think I'd prefer to keep it the way it is.
