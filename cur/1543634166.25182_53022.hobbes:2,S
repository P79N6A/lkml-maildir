It is all so confusing.  I see two MP 1900+ as "POST"
While linux is booting up, it shows AMD 1900+ XP's, then
after a lot of booting log, I see
ENABLING IO-APIC IRQs
Setting 2 in the phys_id_present_map
... changing IO-APIC ID 2 ... ok
TIMER: vector=0x31 pin1=2 pint2=0
Then, nothing.  It stops completely.
What is going on?
Secondly, what CPUs do I really have?  MP enabled or not?
Thanks
