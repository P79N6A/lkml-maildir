We were doing double preempt_disable() before as well.  The only
difference is that we moved RCU preempt_enable() (it used to be inside the
critical section, and now it is after the corresponding spin_unlock()).
I hope to keep RCU API proliferation down to a dull roar, but if we
need more APIs, we need more APIs.  This example does not demonstrate
that need to me, however.
