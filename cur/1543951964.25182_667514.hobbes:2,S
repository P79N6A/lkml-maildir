At first, in my understanding,
- MOVABLE is for migratable pages. (so, not for kernel objects.)
- RECLAIMABLE is for reclaimable kernel objects. (for slab etc..)
All reclaimable objects are not necessary to be always reclaimable but
some amount of RECLAIMABLE objects (not all) should be recraimable easily.
For example, some of dentry-cache, inode-cache is reclaimable because *unused*
objects are cached.
When it comes to page_cgroup, *all* objects has dependency to pages which are
assigned to.  And user pages are reclaimable.
There is a similar object....the radix tree. radix-tree's node is allocated as
RECLAIMABLE object.
So I think it makes sense to changing page_cgroup to be reclaimable.
But final decision should be done by how fragmentation avoidance works.
It's good to test "how many hugepages can be allocated dynamically" when we
make page_cgroup to be GFP_RECAIMABLE
