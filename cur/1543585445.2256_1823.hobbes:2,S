SIGSEGV.
Stack overflow for a language like C using standard implementation techniques
is the same as a page fault while accessing a page for which there is no backing
store. SIGSEGV is the logical choice, and the one I'd expect on other Unices.
oom_kill should simply fail the current allocation which cannot be satisfied,
either by having {s,}brk/mmap return error or by posting a SIGSEGV. This would
actually also be the correct answer, if Linux didn't overcommit memory ...
Remove the overcommit crap and oom_kill can go away; this entails ensuring
that mmap() honors MAP_RESERVE/MAP_NORESERVE.
