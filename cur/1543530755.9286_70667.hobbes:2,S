OK. Thanks. I'll wait for an update.
I guess that this will (in my case) bring the PCMCIA stuff "back" to the 
post 2.3.36 state, where I had to load the tulip_cb module manually, 
in order to get the card working. 
- Or will it also solve the problem, that cardmgr cannot find my card?
(and initially believes that its a 5V card - or has this maybe something
to 
do with timings, which was discussed earlier on the linux-kernel)
