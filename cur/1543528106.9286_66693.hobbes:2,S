I have running here a webfarm, which each customer being
confined into a chrooted, rlimited and quotaed environment so
that this customer can write private CGI scripts and stuff
without me being worried about CGI security. Mounting devpts,
devfs, proc and ipcfs into each customers chrooted environment
would be a PITA and using an automatic access method to such
filesystems via magic filenames would greatly help in this
configuration.
