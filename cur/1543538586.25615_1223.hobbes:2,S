well its been brought to my attention that, indeed, there is the 82802 RNG
driver in the kernel and, looking over the source, its everything i dreamed
of.  i apologize for the unnecessary post.  the maintainer appears to be
good ol Jeff Garzik, so i guess its off to find another project (although
there are a few fixme's/todo's in the source...hmmm...).
thanks for the tips.
