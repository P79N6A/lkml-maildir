I agree, that's the interface that I want.

That's true. It's trivial for bios coming out of bio pools, for
privately allocated ones it gets a bit worse. Should not be hard to
clean up, though.

Hmm I don't like that too much. For reference, bi_vcnt from the block
layer is the number of bio_vecs in the bio. And bi_idx is the index into
the 'current' bio_vec. To tie that in with the above, how about just
changing bi_max to be a real number. Internal bio can still find the
pool from that, and private bios can just fill it out.
