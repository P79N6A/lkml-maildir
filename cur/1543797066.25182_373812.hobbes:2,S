The bug mentions some reasons why this patch is sub-optimal - namely that
the beginning of the UUID has common fields in it.  It may make more sense
to e.g. XOR the first 2 * u32 with the last 2 * u32 to reduce the chance
of an FSID collision.
Also, there is a tiny memory of a security issue with exposing the FSID
to applications (something to do with NFS and guessing filehandles or
similar).  I have no idea if that is even relevant any longer, but
thought I'd mention it.
