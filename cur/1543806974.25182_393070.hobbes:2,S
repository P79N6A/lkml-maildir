In this particular case you may be right, but I'm looking at the bigger
picture, where plain 16550's may be used for RS485.
There are drivers which want to implement their own private ioctl to
enable RS485 mode.  What I'm saying is that we should have one solution,
not multiple solutions to this problem.  When we have such a solution,
your RS485 card will be able to fit into that model.
