    Why do you think, the same shouldn't be done for char_device?
    You are removing the wrong infrastructure, check how block_dev.c changed 
    between 2.4 and 2.5 and the same still needs to be done for char_dev.c.
Maybe. Maybe not.
I don't think such things will happen before 2.6.
It is very easy to add this code again for 2.7 if desired.
Today it is just a lot of dead code.

(And for me the question is still open whether we really want
something like struct char_device for 2.7.)
