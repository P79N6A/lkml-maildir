root does not use netscape -FULLSTOP-
Anyone working as root is (sorry) an idiot! root's processes are normally
quite system-relevant and so they should never be killed, if we can avoid 
it.
There can however be processes owned by other users which shouldn't be
killed in OOM-Situation, but generally root's processes are more important
than a normal user's processes.
What about doing something really critical to avoid the upcoming OOM-situ
and get your shell killed because you were to slow?
