What about implementing this specific to the function? i.e. you usually
wouldn't turn on all the asserts, just the ones for the function you
thought had the bug. This wouldn't slow down the kernel nearly as much,
and with all of them on it could take awhile to sift through all the
information. And, you wouldn't need to put it in the whole kernel right
away, you could insert the code as it was needed.
