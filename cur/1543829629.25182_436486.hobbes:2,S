Since gcc-2.96 would access 256 bytes below the stack pointer
(according to the valgrind man page), the kernel needs to allow
for this in signal handlers anyway.
I'm pretty sure I saw that code in the kernel in fact, but I
can't find it now. Perhaps it got lost in a cleanup accident?
(it sure would be nice to have continuous source control history)
