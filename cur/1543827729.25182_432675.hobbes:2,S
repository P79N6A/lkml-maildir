Aaargh:
Its HEX and I tried always in my "linuxrc":
------------------------- [ BEGIN linuxrc ] -------------------------
...
# brw-rw----    1 root     disk      33,   1 Jan 19  2001 /dev/hde1
echo 0x3301 > /proc/sys/kernel/real-root-dev
...
------------------------- [ END   linuxrc ] -------------------------
So it would have probably worked if I would have written "echo  
0x2101 ..."
Thank you, Randy.
