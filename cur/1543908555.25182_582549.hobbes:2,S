Err, that wasn't the claim I was refuting. I was refuting the claim
that performing those actions required complexity. The claim I was
refering to said nothing about any of those features or anything about
their integration.

That's fine, but hardly relevent to the fact that the 1990's systems
performed the list of functions.

Smack is designed to treat objects as consistantly as is reasonable.
The list of object classes defined by SELinux is great for a system
designed to treat accesses with the highest possible granularity.
This is not a design goal for Smack.

I will be happy to consider your arguement when you are willing

That doesn't help your case any.

Neither. Bind attaches a name (port number) to a socket (which is a
data structure that is part of your process) from a global namespace.
No objects are involved, hence no accesses.

I don't. Accept happens after a TCP connection has been established.
The access control is all mediated long before the accept'er finds
out about it.

There certainly isn't in SELinux. I don't subscribe the the list
of SELinux object classes. We can argue a long time over whether a
socket is an object or not, and it won't help any real world application
one bit.

Well, I'm interested in seeing the actual code, not "the same kind

Good question. First, changing Smack rules is no big deal. They
can be added or changed one by one as required while the system is
running, and there are uses that exploit that. One example is to
put the label "Game" on certain programs and:
   at 8:00am "Worker Game no"
   at 5:00pm "Worker Game x"
Thus Worker processes can access Game files only during off hours.
As far as relabeling the file system goes, the rules apply to
processes and objects, not to programs. The label on a program
describes who can access it, it will run with the label of the
process that exec's it. A change in the rules does not require a
change to the labels on the file system for things to work
according to the rules of engagement.

I'm sorry, but again, I don't know what you mean by "changing the
meaning of new types".

I think you may be making assumptions about the behavior of
Smack based on what SELinux does that don't hold. I hesitate
to call a Smack rule list a language.

Heavens, I should hope so!
Smack rule specifications are really really basic, just the
subject label, the object label, and the access permitted.
There are no wildcards, no expressions (regular or otherwise)
and they apply to all objects. Only the labels are taken into
account on an access check, not the userid, the current
directory, the time of day, or the binary involved. Oh,
there is a capability to override the check, but that's just
basic Linux behavior and I wouldn't want to muck that up.

There is only one rule to copy. I think most sysadmins can insert
a "T" with sufficient confidence that this is not going to be a
major issue.

Which if you actually write out the change is going to require
more than inserting a "T".

I think there's a rule against using proprietary information

Hmm. You snuck the adjective "root" into the discussion when it

I much prefer strait-up process capabilities to magic attributes.

With privilege comes responsibility, and there has to be some effort
made to ensure that privileged programs behave correctly.

It means you have not only the program to worry about being written

That's true about Smack, you know. The process has no choice about
the label that the files gte.

You might want to review the archives on how that experiment ended up
before saying much more about it.
Thank you for your comments. I hope that I have made the behavior
and value of Smack clearer in responding to them.
