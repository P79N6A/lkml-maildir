No, not a thing.  Also invisible in the mainboards bios config AFAICT.

Running at 400 FSB it gradually ate itself and turned into a brick.  Took 
about 3 hours of screwing around to recover cuz even a cmos reset left it 400 
and it wouldn't recognize my usb keyboard, so I had to dig out an IBM 
clickity clakker, one of those cast iron models & plug it into the ps2 socket 
to get its attention and get back into the bios and get it slowed down.  This 
must have been good though cuz the cpu went down another 5 degrees when I 
did.
I did another install of F8 on that drive, but on the reboot, only FC6 
on /dev/hda1(=/boot and hda3=/) were visible so I'm still on FC6.
This is with a bios release only about 90 days old for what can best be 
described as a legacy mobo, a Biostar M7NCD Pro.  No onboard sata or 
firewire.
The install did put its bootfile stuff on /dev/sda1, and I've copied them back 
to the FC6 /boot partition, but I am confused as to how to handle the 
differences for this in the kernel arguments I use in adding that stanza to 
the existing /boot/grub/grub.conf, and, what to do with the differences 
in /boot/grub/device.map between the 2 installs.  Some guidance with this 
regard would be nice.
FWIW, the f8 install is on VolGroup01, so it does know the difference, but 
udev did NOT generate those files in /dev when it ran, so I'm reticent to do 
a fix there by any method but editing some udev file somehow so its permanent 
once done.
Thanks Robert.
