Having thought about this over night I've come to the conclusion that 
(because it is set using sched_clock()) timestamp is always bigger than 
timestamp_last_tick for a short period of time (i.e. until the next time 
  scheduler_tick()).  This doesn't effect the load balancing code that 
is triggered by scheduler_tick() (for obvious reasons) but all other 
load balancing code is susceptible to the problem.  The setting of 
timestamp in activate() just exacerbates the problem and the fact that 
Ingo's VP work is reducing the amount of time that it takes tasks to get 
from wake up to a point where load balancing is triggered (or they're 
involved in load balancing decisions) other than by scheduler_tick() 
means that it matters more than it used to.
