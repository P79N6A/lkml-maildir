I actually tried the xfs_db method to fix my / filesystem (as you had
outlined in http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=115070320401919&w=2),
and while it's quite possible that I screwed it up, after a subsequent
xfs_repair run (which completed successfully and moved lots of stuff
to /lost+found, as I would expect), the XFS code had serious problems
with various parts of my filesystem (like "ls /lost+found", which
would cause lots of errors to be logged, although not a complete fs
shutdown). After another run through xfs_repair resulted in a
filesystem that would no longer even successfully boot.
Unfortunately it was a mostly-full 74GB big-/ partition on my primary
machine (a laptop), so I don't have a dump of it for you and my report
is probably pretty useless. :( But on the bright side, virtually all
of the filesystem was otherwise intact and I was able to get all my
data off before rebuilding my system.
