Interesting point -- update-in-place combined with the ->deleted flag
does require some additional mechanism.  In some cases, the approach you
call out works (give or take the need for added memory barriers in order
to guarantee that the list_add_rcu() happends before the list_del_rcu()).
In other cases, such as in dcache, it is necessary to restart the search
from the beginning.
My thought would be to add some words saying that this example is
not cumulative with the _upd_ example.  I do need to keep the simple
deleted-flag example, since this is a common usage.
Thoughts?

Excellent point, will add this.  Any favorite example code?  ;-)
