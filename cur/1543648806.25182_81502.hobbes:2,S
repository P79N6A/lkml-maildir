No, it removes most of such cases. It happens only for a general boolean
controlling expression, and this is the only spot as far as we tested. But
our argument is that the checking code is not required because
thread.i387.fxsave is __attribute__ ((aligned (16))). If __attribute__
((aligned (...))) is broken, we should see more problems.
Thanks,
Jun

True :-)
Well it should. There are tons of similar patterns all over the kernel
which use the same trick.
If it didn't optimize  all of these, there would be many more problems.
