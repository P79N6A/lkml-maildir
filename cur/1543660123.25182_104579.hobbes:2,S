So it seems that many more people care about _not_ using "GNU/" with
"Linux".  Yes those people are 1) many and 2) speak on their own and 3)

Just as every other free software developers.  Yet the _majority_ of those
GNU developers seem to be quite happy with the way they get credits,
otherwise they would complain on their own.  You just can't decide for the
