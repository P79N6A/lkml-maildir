Ok, my last word on the subject is that changing the partition code to
be modules seems like an acceptable change (subject to Linus' of course),
but I think the autodetection and usermode stuff is not such a good idea.
I think this is a nice compromise - it allows kernels to be built with
just the minimum required to mount the root filesystem; everything else
can be loaded as a module as the user requires.  IMHO, the user should
know what they're doing if they are fiddling around with "foreign" hard
drive partition tables after all.
