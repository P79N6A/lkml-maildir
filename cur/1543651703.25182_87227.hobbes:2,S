Let me take a minute to reiterate: EVMS is not going away and has not
given up on any of it's original goals.  EVMS will still use a plug-in
architecture in the user space tools (Engine) to coordinate across
different types of kernel volume management drivers.  You will still
be able to use EVMS to partitions disks, create MD RAID arrays,
add these arrays to LVM containers, create regions and volumes and
mkfs your filesystems and a whole lot more, all from the EVMS
interface you know and love.

Could happen, but don't hold your breath.

Sure, why not.  EVMS can manage both and can be expanded to manage other
device types as well.

But users matter!!!  If we get the migration right (and we will) the only
thing
you will notice different with EVMS are the kernel config options and the
ramdisk /ramfs stuff.  Everything else should look and fell and work
exactly
the same from a user's point of view.
