Totally irrelevant.

Not right now.  Truncating directories on a mounted filesystem is
probably going to be a big source of strange problems.  In the end
it isn't really a problem for most people, because if your directory
has grown big once it is likely to grow big again.
With htree directories we will have to make this work at some point,
because you will be able to create huge directories and not being able
to free directory blocks would be a big pain.  It isn't in the current
htree directory code yet, but it has been discussed a bit already.
Cheers, Andreas
