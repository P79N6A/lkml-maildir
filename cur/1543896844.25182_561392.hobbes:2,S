Subject: [PATCH] trivial: the memset operation on a automatic array variable should be optimized out by data initialization
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

From: Denis Cheng <crquan@gmail.com>
the explicit memset call could be optimized out by data initialization,
thus all the fill working can be done by the compiler implicitly.
and C standard guaranteed all the unspecified data field initialized to zero.

I also think this style of zero initialization would be better.
so the patch is little different:
