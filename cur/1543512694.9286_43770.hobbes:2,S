    I can certainly understand that, but I'm an impatient sort and I
    really really REALLY want to have a devfs in the kernel;  a flat
    filesystem[1] isn't any worse than 100-e% of the current Linux
    systems are, and if it would put a devfs into the mainline kernel
    that would still be better than the traditional way of doing things.

    [1: which can't really be flat, because of the ptx subdirectory [2] ]
    [2: Isn't that a devfs?  What's it doing in the kernel, anyway? ]
