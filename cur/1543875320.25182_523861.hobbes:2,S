The pkt_count is zero at the moment of assignment above.
Please look at the included trace again:

The assignment happens at .305535. The pkt_count is zero, and fy(0) contains
stale data (ovewritten by the assignment). The touchpad reports a position
next with input_report_abs(). If the position were different, we'd receive
an event between .305535 and .305538 and it would be stored in fy(0).
However, if position is the same, as in this case, input_report eats it.
At .305541 we increment pkt_count. The fy(0) location becomes fy(1) at
this point. Without the assignment it contains the stale position.
I can explore alternatives, but for now using dev->abs[] seems to be most
expedient.
