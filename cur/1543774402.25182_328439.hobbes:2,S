Does it still works if the last commit was interrupted  or due to error for some
reason?  Undo pull is pretty cool because you might pull a lot of commit
in one blow. Get rid of commit one by one is going to be painful. Some times
the object you pull has more than one chain of history it will be very nasty
if you want to clean it up.
Mercurial's undo is taking a snapshot of all the changed file's repo file length
at every commit or pull.  It just truncate the file to original size and undo 
is done.
