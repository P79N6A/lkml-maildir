The box runs stable for days on end.
Only when running gpg --gen-key I get this issue.
Other gpg operations, run by a user, are without issue.
There is 512MB of RAM and the hardware is `refreshed` regularly when an
interesting VIA board comes out. Case stays closed otherwise. I am ESD
certified. (or how to put that in the english language)
memtest86 shows no problems. Kernel compiles etc run without issue.
F7 upgraded installation. Updated regularly. gnupg rpm is Red Hat-stock.
 My own compiles of gnupg show the same error.
So what is next?
