The patchset increases these failures significantly since there will be a 
longer time period where these allocations can fail.
The swap loads are fine as long as we do not exhaust the reserve pools.
IMHO the right solution is to throttle the networking layer to not do 
unbounded allocations. You can likely do this by checking certain VM 
counters like SLAB_UNRECLAIMABLE. If need be we can add a new category of 
SLAB_TEMPORARY for temporary allocs and track these. If they get too large 
then throttle.
