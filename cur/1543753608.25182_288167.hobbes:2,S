Foo. and me with a BIOS-borked LAPIC.  Anybody have helpful hints on how to
get Dell to fix a laptop BIOS(*), or are you all too busy dying of hysterical laughter?
Dell Latitude C840, running bios A13 (most recent). I *know* it was borked
around A08, and the bios release notes haven't mentioned fixing it.  I wonder
if it's worth re-checking anyhow....
