hm.
With this change we'll emit a warning (actually it's an error - I'll make
it dev_err(), OK?) and then we'll continue execution, pretending that the
sysfs file actually got registered.  Later, we'll try to unregister a
not-registered sysfs file.
So it's all a bit flakey when you look at it in a dumb fashion.
But I think the patch is OK - if that class_device_create_file() fails,
then there's some other bug somewhere, and the warning you've added is
sufficient - it tells the developers what the initial failure was, when it
happens.  So later, if someone reports a crash, we'll see that warning in
their logs and it'll lead us to the real bug.  We certainly couldn't
justify adding additional code which attempts to "continue working" if the
class_device_create_file() fails, because it just shouldn't fail.
It's probable that the message will never come out ever, so it's not worth
adding a ton of code to support this.
It'd be better if we had a class_device_create_file_warn() which does the
warning for you: its semantics are "this is expected to succeed".  But if
we do that to class_device_create_file() then we'd need to do it to 200
other things too.
