I will need to spend some time reading through the PathScale code on this.  I've 
  followed most of the discussion, though not in detail.  Right now, I don't see 
what's being gained by not loading ib_mad.  For instance, how does the driver 
handle loading ib_mad later, say when another IB device is added to the system 
that requires it?

I agree that we need to let the userspace interface mature.  And even the kernel 
interface could benefit from having some real users.  The code was added to the 
-mm branch, correct?
The main drawback that we have not merging the RDMA CM with userspace support, 
is that OpenIB release 1.0 will have very poor connection management support. 
There's no easy way for userspace applications to obtain path records.
