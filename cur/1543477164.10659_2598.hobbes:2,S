Once again, you prefer to mouth off, instead of checking
your facts first.  From his web page you can see he got
his PhD from Carnegie Mellon in 1994.
Not to say his criticisms are all correct.  He seems to
have overlooked the completion-port-like RT IO signals
Stephen added, for example, and his assertion that 
enterprise-level servers need unlimited performance is
hard to back up.  They just need to be good enough, ie
saturate the comms bandwidth available.  Something I 
don't think NT does.
