Hello,
I hope someone can help me find out an ugly bug.
Sometimes I get the kernel-message
Warning: kfree_skb passed an skb still on a list (from c0.......)
followed by a kernel oops with a complete hang:
Aiee, killing interrupt handler
Kernel panic: Attempted to kill the idle task!
In swapper task - not syncing
What is the best way to find out from which function
kfree_skb was called when this "bad" skb was passed ?
I'm using 2.2.13pre12 with 233MHz MMX Pentium.
I'm checking the eicon isdn driver with about
10.000 connections per day over a 30 channel 2MBit
isdn line. It runs perfectly, except this problem
here, which occurs about once per day.
Any help would be appreciated.
Regards,
Armin
