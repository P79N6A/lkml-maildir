Hi,
Xterm (nor any other VT) won't run on my freshly compiled 
2.5.67-mm4 kernel. It says:
--
xterm: Error 32, errno 2: No such file or directory
Reason: get_pty: not enough ptys
--
When I look in /dev all the ptys are there. Also dmesg 
gives no strange reading (not on this matter).
I attached my .config and dmesg (it does show earlier 
mentioned weird things about IRQ 12, and a little chatter 
about UDF-fs)
Thanks,
Johan Hidding
PS: I haven't got strace compiled yet, but when I tried:
--
# emerge -p strace/strace-4.4-r1
These are the packages that I would merge, in order:
Calculating dependencies   emerge: create(): aux_get() 
error on log/strace-4.4-r1; aborting...
--
I don't know if this is a kernel error, or something
