Hi,
I just wanted to know if there had been some issues regarding memory and/or swap ?
I've been running 2.5.68-mm2 for about 3 weeks now:
$ uptime 
 13:14:43 up 21 days,  2:02, 23 users,  load average: 2.23, 2.25, 2.26
So far, my 600 Mb swap partition is almost full as shown on the following graphs:
http://philou.org/2.5.68-mm2/graph.php.html
dark yellow color is for _remaining_ swap memory.
$ free
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:        514452     485336      29116          0       7812      66664

Usage is typical desktop with many eterms, Opera, mozilla, Pan, Sylpheed , postfix, Enlightenement, xmms etc.. opened all the time.
Hardware is DELL MT530 ( 1.5Ghz XEON SMP,512 Mo RAM, Debian Unstable , Dual heads with Nvidia opensource nv driver)
Should i look into memory leaks with those programs instead ?
Thanks,
Philippe
