It sounds like we'll need a new KD_* flag for this work too, something like 
KD_TEXT_BUT_ONLY_ON_PANIC, sine with the above tree, the kernel will have 
intimite knowledge of the current graphics mode, framebuffer location, 
etc.  It should be enough to clear the scanout buffer and output the 
printk, though if there's a lot of rendering going on, the DRM driver 
might have to be pretty smart about it.
