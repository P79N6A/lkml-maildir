Actually we don't use the MTD.  Well, we may use it to provide the
physical address of the volume, thats not really _using_ it.

It works on very specific block devices to be clear.  Yeah, as I
understand it, the hardware to enable it is missing.

Not having the block device driver is by design.  In this case I don't
need a block device because the entire "disk" or binary image is in
readonly memory already.  I don't need to fetch blocks.  This is
readonly so I don't need to write blocks either.  A block device
driver would do what for me?
Also ext2 doesn't do compression, and it doesn't let me pick out
specific pages in files to XIP or compress.

A little of both.  The architecture of cramfs doesn't lend itself to
the page by page XIP without really changing the fundamental layout of
cramfs.  Why mess with it?

I started out with that goal.  This seemed like the best option after
we did the deep dive into how to go about it.

Data packing:
1) When mkcramfs is writing files to the image it mixes compress and
XIP files.  XIP files are page aligned.  Compressed files are not.  I
think it was about 3.3% wasted I measured on an actual production
linux phone.
2) Choosing page by page to XIP or compress means you can save space,
but it depends on what is more precious, RAM or Flash, given real
designs (ie - you don't buy 36MiB of RAM you get 32MiB or 64MiB)
Performance:
1) The way we are storing the metadata should make for quicker access.
2) Being able to store specific pages of RO data from an otherwise XIP
file such that they end up in RAM has speed thing up for us a great
deal in the lab.
