No problem - I help where I can. Since this appears to be a common
problem, I've forwarded my reply to one of the mailing lists I'm on as
well, and I'm sure there's people on there who will correct me if I'm
wrong.

I'm assuming you're using the kernel supplied on the RH5.2 cd itself,
which is unfortunately a pre-release kernel. For this reason, I'll
suggest you first upgrade to the 2.0.36-3 kernel rpm by downloading
the following files:
	kernel-2.0.36-3.i386.rpm
	kernel-headers-2.0.36-3.i386.rpm
	kernel-ibcs-2.0.36-3.i386.rpm
	kernel-pcmcia-cs-2.0.36-3.i386.rpm
	kernel-source-2.0.36-3.i386.rpm
When you've done so, and are still in the same directory they're in,
type the following lines:
 Q> KNL=''
 Q> for RPM in `rpm -qa | grep ^kernel` ; do \
 Q>	ME=`rpm -qp --queryformat '%{NAME}' ${RPM}` ; \
 Q>	KNL="${KNL} ${ME}-2.0.36-3.i386.rpm" ; \
 Q> done
 Q> rpm -Uvh ${KNL}
This will upgrade all currently installed kernel rpm's to the version
specified without installing any new ones.

Presumably 2.2.5 was the latest when you downloaded it, but I would
recommend going straight to 2.2.7 now. However, assuming you remain
with 2.2.5 instead...

Unfortunately, it doesn't, and you need to create the relevant file
using the old sources first. To create the .config file you'll need to
upgrade the kernel, type the following:
 Q> cd /usr/src/linux-2.0.36
 Q> make oldconfig
 Q> cp .config ../linux-2.2.5
 Q> cd ../linux-2.2.5
 Q> make oldconfig
At this point, you will have the correct .config for the kernel in
question. However, there are known problems with `make xconfig` and it
is not recommended for use with the 2.2 series kernels, so I'd
recommend that you use `make menuconfig` instead at this stage, and
check the following options are set accordingly. These are my
recommendations:
 Q> Processor type and features
Make sure the fields herein are set correctly for your system,
especially the "Processor family" field.
 Q> Loadable module support
All options under this menu should be selected 'Y' (shows as [*] or
<*> on screen).
 Q> Block devices
 Q>		:
 Q>	<M> Loopback device support
 Q>		:
 Q> Filesystems
Under "Native Language Support" in that menu, select EVERY option as
<M> if you have the DOS FAT fs support selected, then go back and
select as <*> the codepages relating to your language.
 > make dep
 > make clean
 > make zImage
 > make modules
 > make modules_install
In my experience, those should be done in a slightly different order,
with `make zImage` last rather than in the middle of the list. Also,
they can all be combined into one command which would then read as
follows:
 Q> make dep clean modules modules_install zImage
In theory, that change of order won't make any difference, but I have
met occasions where it appeared to do so, and I've no idea why...

Basically, you've compiled a kernel configured for Linus's machine
rather than your own. Amongst other things, Linus apparently doesn't
use the loopback driver, as his config omits it.
To make sure you have that facility available, follow the instructions
above...
Best wishes from Riley.
