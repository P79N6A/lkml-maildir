This looks good to me, because it makes the operation of the code more
straightforward and easier to understand. With our docs always lagging,
it's important.
Like you said, it does "punish" people who had "dumb" keyboards, but if
they really are a special class of folks, maybe it's better that way.
And I think it's much easier to type a command to enable softrepeat
than to type a command to disable softrepeat when all your letters come
in twos and threes :-)
