i have released the -U7 Real-Time Preemption patch:
  
http://redhat.com/~mingo/realtime-preempt/realtime-preempt-2.6.9-rc4-mm1-U7
this too is a fixes-only release.
Changes since -U6:
 - crash fix: turn off 4K stacks when using RWSEM_DEADLOCK_DETECTION, 
   and tune down the default max # of tasks traced per semaphore. This 
   increases process-stack size and reduces the footprint of lock 
   objects. This should fix the bootup crash reported by Rui Nuno 
   Capela.
 - assert fix: fixed an ide-taskfile scheduling-with-irqs-off assert
   that Rui's .config triggers.
 - assert workaround: disabled PARPORT_1284 for now, this should fix the
   assert seen by Mark H Johnson.
 - NFS fix: clnt.c fix from Thomas Gleixner
 - debugging helper: print stackframe-size in backtraces.
 - large-stackframe fix: inflate.c fix
to create a -U7 tree from scratch, the patching order is:
