The intent is to allow remote management tools to trigger a clean 
shutdown of the virtual machine. That requires us to notify to 
userspace, and this function does that by exec'ing one of the standard 
userspace programs. Given the trigger is received by the kernel in the 
first instance I don't know a better way of doing this. And if this is 
the best way, I don't think there is generic code in the kernel which 
does the same thing.
