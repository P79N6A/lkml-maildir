Sorry for the late answer, Yahoo put your mail in its Spam folder, and I 
didn't check until now.

Yes, look at the multiple help texts in lib/Kconfig.debug in vanilla 2.6.11, 
or, in the current bk tree, in lib/Kconfig.debug and arch/um/Kconfig for 
MAGIC_SYSRQ. For UML we need different help texts, so I'd like this solved.
If you definitely don't want to fix this, we can use the old 2.4 trick of 
having CONFIG_MAGIC_SYSRQ2, for instance, with the right help and defining 
MAGIC_SYSRQ as equal to MAGIC_SYSRQ2.

Yes, it's what I saw (actually I guess and seem to have verified that the last 
read text is used).
