It's a conventional response implying your rant wasn't factually
connected to the actual problem at hand.  The justification was actually
in the text you cut ... but boils down to you can reproduce it in a non
voyager configuration, so it's not a voyager specific problem.
The actual problem, as I see it, is how (or whether) to get rid of the
nine #if/#ifdefs that clutter setup_percpu.c ... none of which is
voyager specific.
