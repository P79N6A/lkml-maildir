Change subsys/ to some name that means "not device-specific".  
The point is that the net and sound system-level stuff isn't 
composed of device-specific drivers and the other directories 
below linux/ do not have a bunch of device-specific drivers 
associated with them (kernel, fs and mm).

Maybe a better structure is needed, but moving /net alone 
would be a big project.
