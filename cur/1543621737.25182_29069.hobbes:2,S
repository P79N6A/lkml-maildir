You can't read back overwritten magnetic media by running some
magic program. However, it is not impossible to recover some
data from disk-drive tracks that have been overwritten. This
is because new data is unlikely to be written exactly over the
same area of a track as old data. This happens because of the
normal expansion and contraction of the media with changing
temperature.
By changing the alignment phase of the tracking servo, it
may be possible to read data that was written at a different
temperature. The data is not recovered intact, but a significant
percentage may be recovered, enough to be useful in a forensic
investigation or, perhaps espionage.
Since it is not impossible to recover such data, this information
is often exploited. I observed an advertisement on the Web which
showed a burned up disk-drive with its platters exposed and
charred. Implicit in the advertisement was that data had been
recovered from this drive. Such advertising is "legendary".
You can prevent recovery of overwritten data by keeping your
machine running all the while, thus at a near constant temperature.
If you periodically execute a program which writes a file large
enough to fill up the media, sync the file data, then delete it.
The result will be a drive clean enough so it would not contain
evidence of previous file-content except for file names. So,
if the file-name is not evidence you can be assured that the
"Thought Police" will not find your computer useful.
Truly paranoid persons should use file-names like this:

Such file names contain no evidence of the file or directory
content. However, you note that there is some information conveyed
in the date-time. The date-time can be useful for evidence because
it (may) establish when the file was created or modified.
You can fix this problem by setting your system time to 1/1/1970
every time you boot. You could also install Windows-2000/Professional.
That Operating System doesn't stay running long enough to provide
useful evidence.
