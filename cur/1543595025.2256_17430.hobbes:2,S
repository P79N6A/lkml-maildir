I meant, send me a patch for userland ethtool, to do exactly what you
described.

Both APIs do different things but have a common subset, yes.
The MII ioctls only do their thing for MII-like hardware.  ethtool can
be applied to any hardware.  Old ISA drivers that don't do MII, or do it
in a really nonstandard way.  For example I have ethtool code locally
which allows ne2k-pci to do media selection via ioctl, for two popular
ne2k cards, something its never been able to do before.  Emulating media
selection support for things like 10base2<->10baseT<->AUI just isn't
possible with the MII ioctls.
MII is a standard and incredibly popular, thus mii-tool works most
popular PCI NICs, for the most popular media types.  But it's still
basically a hardware interface.  I am not convinced its a good idea for
make the [G]MII ioctls the Linux software media interface for all
network hardware.
I see ethtool as the interface for tuning your NIC, that works across
all hardware.
I see mii-diag as the way to do advance MII-specific hardware stuff,
like next page or HA monitoring or whatever.
