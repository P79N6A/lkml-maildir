nmi_watchdog=1 got me (in dmesg)
Testing NMI watchdog ... CPU#0: NMI appears to be stuck (0->0)!
CPU#1: NMI appears to be stuck (0->0)!
nmi_watchdog=2 got me
Testing NMI watchdog ... OK.
In both cases, when the machine hanged, nothing happened and nothing more 
was written to console, syslog or netconsole (with console Loglevel set to 
9.)

Like I said later I'm using i386 kernel.

I added forcedeth.max_interrupt_work=16 to the command line, and haven't 
seen the problem after that. But I did hit the problem about once a week so 
I can't say if it is gone for good yet.
For the tests with NMI I used forcedeth.max_interrupt_work=2 and managed to 
reproduce the problem in few minutes by copying from /dev/zero to nfs disk. 
I also did it without any binary drivers loaded.
As I see it there is two separate problems: that "too many iterations" 
message and the fact the machine hangs after it. Since the same test was in 
the previous kernel but I don't remember ever seeing it it is possible that 
2.6.22 changed timings or something like that which made hitting the 
default max_interrupt_work limit more likely.
I can try to get 2.6.21.x hang with forcedeth.max_interrupt_work=2 if you 
think that information is useful.
