[My first linux crash in over 3 years]
My linux box was set up for ipmasq with:
=======
/sbin/modprobe ip_masq_ftp
echo "1" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
echo "1" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_always_defrag
/sbin/ipchains -M -S 7200 10 160
/sbin/ipchains -P forward DENY
/sbin/ipchains -A forward -s 192.0.0.0/24 -j MASQ
=======
a windows box had been browsing the net through the linux box several
hours earlier (about 4 hours), and then left alone. when i went back
to the windows box and tried to browse again from the same IExplorer
window, _SNAP_ and the linux machine just plain up and rebooted
instantly....
i am __guessing__  the problem had something to do with using an old
IExplorer session so long after it had last been used??? something
about NAT timeouts or something???
but a hard reboot???
apart from this crash, ipmasq had been working fine (just never tested
with that kind of delay time).
