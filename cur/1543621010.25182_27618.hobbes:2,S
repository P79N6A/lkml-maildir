Is this using "bk clone -l" or just "bk clone"?  I would _imagine_
that since the rmap changes are fairly localized that you would only
get multiple copies of a limited number of files, and it wouldn't
increase the size of each repository very much.
As Larry mentioned, you could re-merge these trees.  The following script
will probably be enough, since we don't want/need to compare all files
in each tree, only SCCS and BitKeeper files that are in the same place
in the heirarchy.  Very lightly tested - Larry will have to tell me if
it is OK to hard-link everything in SCCS and BitKeeper repositories,
or if there are some files that should be ignored.
On my e2fsprogs tree, it takes 12s to relink a clone to its parent,
saving 12/19MB = 63% reduction in space per clone.
Cheers, Andreas
