I'm having problems getting my machines to load nfsroot since I went from
2.2.16 -> 2.2.18. I don't have access to the boot messages, as the
machines are 2000 miles away, but the DHCP messages aren't showing up
anymore, but instead a bunch of RPC messages are. Has anything changed
with regards to DHCP or nfs root since 2.2.17?
Thanks in advance.
