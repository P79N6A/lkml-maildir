Well, you asked...
- the irqbalance patch for p4 needs idle_cpu (and not sure about idle_task).
  BTW, they were macros before...
- the bproc patch needs task_nice (you can be less interested in this, but
  it does not hurt...)
So could I ask you, please
- to make public idle_[cpu,task], as macros or exported functions, here it
  does not matter, irqbalance is not a module. Perhaps some other piece of code
  could need them.
- to export all the set/get prio/nice interfaces
???
Thanks.
