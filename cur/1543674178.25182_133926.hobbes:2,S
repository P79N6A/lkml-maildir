	Not that my opinion matters much, but my feeling is that such measures
are very much of the bandaid taste, the ones which in the end piled one on another 
end up obscuring the very problems in the code.
	In short, it`ll probably make _filling_in_ the code easier, but the effect is
that it will shift the balance towards crap accumulation.
	To me, that is the damage of the kind which is very hard to undo.
