Yeah, the only catch is that if the redundancy checks fail, we now may
leave the repository in an inconsistent, but repairable, state.  (Only a
cache of the pristine tree is affected.)  The recent improvements mostly
came by increasing the laziness of a few operations, which meant we don't
need to store the entire parsed tree (or parsed patch) in memory for
certain operations.
