Ooops, you are right. I forgot about those ones in the threads. Yes you 
are right. Once the sleep goes away rBP displays the correct values. Is 
this issue due to glibc or because of the toolchain? I do not have this 
issues on 32bit x86.... I would assume that the reason it works on 
Mandrake is due to the toolchain they use versus other distros? The 
toolchain determines which registers to use and the 
-fno-omit-frame-pointer did not prevent some of them from clobbering rbp?
