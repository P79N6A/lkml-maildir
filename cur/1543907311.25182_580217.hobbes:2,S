So, the ACPI routine puts the disk into the standby mode before powering
off.  That's good.
On power off, the r/w heads in a disk should be unloaded (parked).  This
is usually achieved by either putting the disk into standby/sleep mode
during shutdown.  However, all modern disks can automatically unload
their heads when the power is removed abruptly.  This is called
emergency unload.  Emergency unload does shorten the lifespan of the
disk but you don't have to worry too much about it.  Disks are designed
to withstand certain number of emergency unloads.
