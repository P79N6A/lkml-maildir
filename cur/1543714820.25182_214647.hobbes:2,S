Think of get_task_struct(foo) as a reference count on foo's task
structure.  So long as the reference count is elevated, foo's task
structure cannot be deallocated.
get_task_struct() is called here because sys_ptrace() needs to ensure
that the child's task structure does not go away out from under this
function, but we do not want to hold the tasklist_lock.

Yes, although it is called "put_task_struct()".  It is called at the end
of this function.
