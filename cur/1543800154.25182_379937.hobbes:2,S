The patches I just sent to the linux-usb-devel list (couple days ago) take
care of those scheduling restrictions...do you have any comments on them?  
It would be great to get them in the kernel so EHCI can fully schedule any
lowspeed or fullspeed buses that it manages.  I even put the changes 
inside a kernel CONFIG option so people can test out the patches fully 
before replacing the old model.
