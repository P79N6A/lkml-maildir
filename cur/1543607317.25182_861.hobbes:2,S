Subject: 2.4.13 - Turtle Beach Tropez+ brings SMP to it's knees

   I just upgraded an SMP box (asus p2b-d / pii-350's) from 2.4.9 to 2.4.13 
and something is really not right.  Any time an app tries to access the sound 
driver (via mixer or dsp at least), the system slows to a complete crawl.  
It's unusable until it times out (?).   No sound is heard.  The card is a 
Turtle Beach Tropez+, ISA PNP (yeah yeah, it worked before so it should work 
now...), sound drivers loaded:  "opl3, wavefront, cs44232, uart401, ad1848". 
Gameport device is also being used (I assume this shouldn't affect the sound 
card itself though).  I am also loading the wavefront firmware from the 
windows driver - wavefront.os.  There were no kernel error messages at all, 
and quite honestly, other than that, the system was very stable for the few 
minutes that I tested.
   Any suggestions?
