It's also almost useless without elevator-low-latency applied ;-)  One
major source of our latencies is a bunch of procs hammering on
__get_request_wait, so bdflush-progess helps by reducing the number of
procs doing io.  It does push some of the latency problem up higher into
balance_dirty, but I believe it is easier to manage there.
bdflush-progress doesn't help at all for non-async workloads.

Hmmm, I think the critical part here is to write some buffers after
marking a buffer dirty.  We don't check the generation number until
after marking the buffer dirty, so if the generation has incremented at
all we've made progress.  What am I missing?
