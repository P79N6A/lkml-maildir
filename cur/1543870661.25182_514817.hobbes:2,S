Nope, you dont quite understand how load (avenrun[]) is computed.
Every 5 seconds, three values are adjusted, based on their previous value and 
the actual value. Lets focus on the first value (mean load average on one 
minute)
exp = 1.0 / exp(5.0/60.0);
avenrun[0] = (avenrun[0] * exp) + (active * (1.0 - exp));
If previous value is 0.0, and current active count 1, then next value for 
avenrun[0] will be : 0.0799556
Not exactly 1.0 as you think !
Then in the next intervals (if active count is 0), it will decrease 'slowly' : 
0.0735627
0.0676809
0.0622695
0.0572907
In average, your load factor close to reality.
Just try my suggestion, it should work. I even proved it in my previous 
mail :)
