Implement it in libc?
Really, I don't understand why people want file as directory occur magically.
In Unix we already have files and directories, it's enough.
You can modify libc creat("file", mode) to create a directory layout with a 
file named #content (or whatever special name you want) and attributes are 
files in this directory:
emilio@ellugar:~/tm$ ls -lR
.:
total 4
drwxr-xr-x  2 emilio emilio 4096 2004-08-26 12:58 file
./file:
total 0
-rw-r--r--  1 emilio emilio 0 2004-08-26 12:58 attribute1
-rw-r--r--  1 emilio emilio 0 2004-08-26 12:58 attribute2
-rw-r--r--  1 emilio emilio 0 2004-08-26 12:57 #content
Of course we should modify open, rename, etc... so open("file", ...) will
do open("file/#content", ...), etc.. but no need to touch any filesystem 
and will work on any fs. 
Of course there are lots of questions of being backwars compatible etc, but
no more than doing it in the kernel.

Emilio
