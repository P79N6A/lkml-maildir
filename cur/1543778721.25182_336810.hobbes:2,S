Subject: [PATCH 2.6.13-rc3 0/6] failure of acpi_register_gsi() should be handled properly
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Hi,
Current acpi_register_gsi() function has no way to indicate errors to
its callers even though acpi_register_gsi() can fail to register gsi
because of some reasons (out of memory, lack of interrupt vectors,
incorrect BIOS, and so on). As a result, caller of acpi_register_gsi()
cannot handle the case that acpi_register_gsi() fails. I think failure
of acpi_register_gsi() should be handled properly.
This series of patches changes acpi_register_gsi() to return negative
value on error, and also changes callers of acpi_register_gsi() to
handle failure of acpi_register_gsi().
Thanks,
Kenji Kaneshige
