Misconfigured or malfunctioning border router at Demon is supposed to be
the prime suspect for non-vj checksum errors to us. 
Turning off vj or restricting the window size gets rid of errors caused by
Ascend dropping packets. I reported remaining errors to Tim Preston at
Demon and he diagnosed a defective border router card.
