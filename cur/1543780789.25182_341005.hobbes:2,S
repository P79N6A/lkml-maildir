Subject: [RFC] Cumulative NTP cleanujp and generic timekeeping patch (v B5)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

All,
	Since I doubt everyone wants to save and apply 20-some patches to test
my patch (and that assumes they want to test my patch ;), attached is
the cumulative patch (thankyou git!) of the NTP cleanup work as well as
the generic timekeeping code against linus's current tree.
Please let me know if you have any comments or feedback.
thanks
