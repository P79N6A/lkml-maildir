HPUX, Solaris, True64, AIX and Reliant UNIX have the same behaviour.

No Linux is the only *NIX I know which did it this way (I do not have
any *BSD here). So all these programs are not portable?
I had some discussion with Al Viro about that issue, because in the
old Linux way a shm segment is something like a globally open file
descriptor and in the new behaviour it is simply a temporary file.  I
first wanted to invent something along the open fd think case but Al
objected and I am convinced that he was right.
