I agree. (But I'm not particularly good at coming up with names ;) 
build.conf is maybe not too bad considering that there may be a day where 
it is extended to support "<driver>.conf" as well.
One other thing I wanted to mention but forgot was that lkc now
does a quiet "make oldconfig" when .config changed or does not exist, 
which is changed behavior.
I intentionally only printed a message and errored out in this case, and I 
think that's more useful, particularly for people doing
make all 2>&1 > make.log
which now may take forever waiting for input.
