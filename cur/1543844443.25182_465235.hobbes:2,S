I don't have the bandwidth to do that work, alas.  I know how to do it, and
have tried to do it, but a) it's dull and b) even I get tired of whining at
people all the time.
The good news is that google is prepared to hire someone to sit next to me
and do it, but I haven't got off my ass and written the job description
yet.
