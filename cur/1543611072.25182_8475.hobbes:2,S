Oh yes, I've implemented a feeble mmap, but it never
get's to the point where it calls f_op->mmap:
It actually issues a read, starts the program with
start_thread, and it gets a segfault !
All this without calling a single line of code that
I've written that could be the cause of the segfault.
If it had page faulted, it would have been ok, since
readpage would have taken care of it ...
