Hi Linus,
Please pull the 'drm-fixes' branch from
ssh://master.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/airlied/drm-2.6.git drm-fixes
One GEM fix + a patch to disable it on PAE for now, we need to do some 
invasive work to AGP + set_memory_array to make it work properly.
Dave.

    drm/i915: GEM on PAE has problems - disable it for now.
    
    On PAE systems, GEM allocates pages using shmem, and passes these
    pages to be bound into AGP, however the AGP interfaces + the x86
    set_memory interfaces all take unsigned long not dma_addr_t.
    
    The initial fix for this was a mess, so we need to do this correctly
    for 2.6.29.

    drm/i915: Don't return busy for buffers left on the flushing list.
    
    These buffers don't have active rendering still occurring to them, they just
    need either a flush to be emitted or a retire_requests to occur so that we
    notice they're done.  Return unbusy so that one of the two occurs.  The two
    expected consumers of this interface (OpenGL and libdrm_intel BO cache) both
    want this behavior.
