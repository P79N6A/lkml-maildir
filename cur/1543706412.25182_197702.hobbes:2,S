Sorry, last reply "just went" for some reason... ijn any case I hope the 
number and tone of replies has shown that a number of people DO care, 
and that "you can just program around it with your effort instead of 
mine" isn't going to be popular.
In other words, this sounds more like 2.7 material where people expect 
things to change than something which should just suddenly break in 2.6. 
Violation of Plauger's Law of Least Astonishment and all that.
