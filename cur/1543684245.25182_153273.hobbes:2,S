Thanks for that. In the meantime, I've started to give a try to the
userspace version (using a LD_PRELOAD lib). My current Problem:
amtus:~/sigill_catcher# LD_PRELOAD=./libsigill.so ls
sigill.c:_init():69: sigill started, sigaction() = 0
build.sh  intercept.h  libsigill.so  run.sh  sigill.c  sigill.o
amtus:~/sigill_catcher# LD_PRELOAD=./libsigill.so apt-get update
Illegal instruction
See? It's loaded at the "ls" call, but it seems to be not loaded for
apt-get.
I've tried to put the lib's name into /etc/ld.so.preload, but it seems
it's never loaded then (for apt-get, ls is doing fine...):
amtus:~/sigill_catcher# cat /etc/ld.so.preload 
sigill.c:_init():69: sigill started, sigaction() = 0
/root/sigill_catcher/libsigill.so
amtus:~/sigill_catcher# apt-get update
Illegal instruction
Where's the difference? Seems I don't know enough about ld.so...
Any useful hints for me?
MfG, JBG
