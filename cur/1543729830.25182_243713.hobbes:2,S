The attached patches against to 2.6.8.1 kernel improve the performance
and the scalability of SELinux by RCU-approach.
The evaluation results are as follows:
<Environment>
CPU: Itanium2(1GHz) x 4/8/16/32
Memory: enough (no swap)
OS: 2.6.8.1 (SELinux disabled by 'selinux=0' boot option)
    2.6.8.1 (SELinux enabled)
    2.6.8.1 + rwlock patch by KaiGai
    2.6.8.1 + RCU patch by KaiGai
The test program iterates write() to files on tmpfs 500,000 times in parallel.
It is attached as 'rcutest.c'.
We observed performance improvement and perfect scalability.

  - lefthand of lower column is the UserTime, righthand is the SysTime.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
These patches achieve lock-free read access to AVC cache.
Significant changes are as follows:
- Direct references by avc_entry_ref were removed for RCU.
- Some structures(avc_entry/avc_node/avc_cache) were changed for RCU.
- avc_node type objects are allocated dynamically, not statically.
  avc_reclaim_node() reclaims some avc_node objects when the number of
  objects exceeds AVC_CACHE_THRESHOLD.
- For updating av_decision structure, I came up with a new RCU primitive,
  list_replace_rcu() in include/linux/list.h .
  It is needed to switch the linked pointer atomically, and replace
  an old object with a new one. list_replace_rcu() is used in avc_update_node()
  to update av_decision structure, and an original object is duplicated and updated.
  We now pay more cost for updating av_decision structure as a compensation
  for lock-free read access. But, in my opinion, updating av_decision is so rare.
NOTE: The fifth arguments of avc_has_perm() and avc_has_perm_noaudit()
      are not necessary. But the prototype declarations and all the callers
      remain, since I want to avoid messing up the patches.
Any comments?
