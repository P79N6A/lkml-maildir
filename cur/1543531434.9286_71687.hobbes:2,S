---I only read the linux-digest so copy my personally on any responces--
I am writing a kernel module that needs to access some of the internel
kernel structures specifically proc_root_* in a 2.2.14 kernel. For
example if I do the following in my code
extern struct proc_dir_entry *proc_root_modules;
the module compiles. But when I start to use the pointer, I get unresloved
symbol warnings when I try to insmod the module. 
The symbol is listed in the /System.map but not /proc/ksyms.
My question is am I trying to reference this wrong or are the symbols in
/proc/ksysm  the only ones my module has access to?
