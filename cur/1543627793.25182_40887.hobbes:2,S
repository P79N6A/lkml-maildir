Nope. -O2 implies constant folding, and h is a constant. What you are
compairing is runtime vs compile time values. 5.0 is compile time.
1/h where h is a constant is compile time (O2) and that would
come out at 5.0 also
Been there done that... My solution (based on the problem I was working
in) was to multiply both sides by the 10^<number of siginificant digits
of the problem set>. Taking the simplistic approach:
if (int(1/h * 100) == int(5.0 * 100))
will give a "proper" result within two decimal places. This is still
limited since there are irrational numbers within that range that COULD
still come out with a wrong answer, but is much less likely to occur.
Exact match of floating point is not possible - 1/h is eleveated to a float.
If your 1/h was actually num/h, and num computed by summing .01 100 times
I suspect the result would also be "wrong".
