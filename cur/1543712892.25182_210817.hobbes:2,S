Actually this issue is not SCSI related, but a generic problem that one
can run into when fiddling around with modules / module unloading.
This was already discussed elsewhere. Please have a look here:
http://lwn.net/Articles/67421/
(paragraph "Module unloading in a reference counted world")
and here for the whole thread:
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0401.2/1832.html
(just saw that you participated there :)
I would be more than happy to have a nice release function for the zfcp
generated objects, but I don't think this is currently possible without
having the potential problem to run into an Oops after module unloading.
