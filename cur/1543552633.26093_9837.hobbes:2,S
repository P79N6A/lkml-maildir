Yes. I have the same problem Rik has. A debug printf just before the
ioctl in lv_create_remove gives the right ->lv_snapshot_minor.
A debug printk in lvm_do_lv_create just at the beginning has
->lv_snapshot_minor _always_ = 0.
This happens with the 0.8final utils, both with and without additional
patches. Andrea's lvm-tools-aa-20000119 are ok.
Look like a structure mis-match to me, although lv_v2_t is the same for
all tools.
