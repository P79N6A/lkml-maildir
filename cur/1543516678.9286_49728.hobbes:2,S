That's obvious, I only used "write_lock_trylock()" as a shorthand for
"lock;btrl RWL;jc, test ;jnz".
My pseudo-code describes a possible race if 1 CPU calls "down_exclusive()"
and the second CPU calls "down_shared()", the lock is free.
Boths CPU's could to enter the "slow" path, and unless you are really
careful, then both CPU's could  schedule(), and noone will wake them up.
I think the first reader must starve a sleeping writer, or we risk a
lock-up.
