The second problem is in the dvdrw-support patch in the -mm kernel.
(This patch is also included in the patch you are using.)
The problem is that some drives fail the "GET CONFIGURATION" command
when asked to only return 8 bytes. This happens for example on my
drive, which is identified as:
        hdc: HL-DT-ST DVD+RW GCA-4040N, ATAPI CD/DVD-ROM drive
Since the cdrom_mmc3_profile() function already allocates 32 bytes for
the reply buffer, this patch is enough to make the command succeed on
my drive.
