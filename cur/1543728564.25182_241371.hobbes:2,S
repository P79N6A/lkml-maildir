Hello, 
Is the generation of *.s files from *.S files in the kernel
build system a wide spread phenomenon? As far as I can see
only vmlinux.lds.s is built that way in my default i386 config.
It causes problems when trying to cross-build a kernel on a 
file system that has case-insensitive filenames, or on a GNU
port that is case insensitive (such as Cygwin).
If anyone wondered, I'm trying to cross build a Linux kernel
on a Cygwin system using a Linux native toolchain, in order
to make development of the Windows port of coLinux easier
for some people.
