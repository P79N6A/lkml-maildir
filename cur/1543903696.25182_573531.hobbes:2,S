It is much more preferred to have code available in the mailer than
being forced to copy it from some big patch somewhere when you
want to point out something.
Obviously the big picture is needed too. But the introductory mail
describing the overall design and functionality should provide most of this.
This submission obviously also failed to provide such an overall design intro.
