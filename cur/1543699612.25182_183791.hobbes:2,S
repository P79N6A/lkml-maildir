Yes, it is weird.  I've now asked shuttle for more information.

I hope this is not the case!  The one/two grep test worked flawlessly, but now if it's delayed, then I can't do that anymore.

I suggest you reference the Shuttle AN35 12-05-2003 BIOS, and maybe Bob's MSI, when you talk to Asus.  If they can do it, then Asus should be able as well.
