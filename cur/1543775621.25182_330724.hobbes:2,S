I can't see any effect of this option outside the i386-specific APM 
code.

-	  Say Y here if your RTC (Real Time Clock a.k.a. hardware clock)
-	  stores the time in GMT (Greenwich Mean Time). Say N if your RTC
-	  stores localtime.

-	  It is in fact recommended to store GMT in your RTC, because then you
-	  don't have to worry about daylight savings time changes. The only
-	  reason not to use GMT in your RTC is if you also run a broken OS
-	  that doesn't understand GMT.
