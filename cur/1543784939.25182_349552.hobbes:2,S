Yes, but I think IsolateDevice still isn't quite enough if you
have VGA devices behind PCI-PCI bridges.  In other words, devices
behind bridges still get disabled, even with IsolateDevice.
And the ideal situation would be if IsolateDevice could be the
*default*, but the X bugzilla[1] says some devices have problems
with that.
