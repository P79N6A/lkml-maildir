I don't think daz bit depend on sse2, it's a separate features

intel and x64 doc advocate to use
mxcsr &= tsk->thread.i387.fxsave.mxscr_mask
	? 0xffbf : tsk->thread.i387.fxsave.mxscr_mask;
tsk->thread.i387.fxsave.mxscr =  mxcsr;
with mxscr_mask the 16 upper bits of field currently named
mxscr in fxsave area. This bits was zeroed by previous processor
so this must be backward compatible.
