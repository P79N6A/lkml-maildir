    the subject I struggled over this thing is still my not working
    MO-drive. I sat down to extensivly test the conditions when and how my
    Optical behaves when mounting it. 
    As said earlier this is an older Optical drive with SCSI revision: 01 CCS
    ....
    In short I can see my A and Bside of the MO-media when I go through a
    uninserted media step.
    Scenario same as above EXCEPT I mount via mount <mountpoint> (/mnt/Aopto).
    My entry in fstab: /dev/sdc    /mnt/Aopto    ext2    noauto    0    0
    ...
    Now I change the side of the cartridge and do the same again.
    Doing so I get the WRONG content listed from Bside. The tree is still
    the same as on the Aside. 
    My question: why this behavior when working with fstab entries???
There may well be a kernel bug somewhere here,
where perhaps check_media_change is not done right.
On the other hand, the report is rather fuzzy.
The kernel does not know anything about fstab.
That is something the mount program looks at.
So, whether or not you use fstab ought not to make any difference.
You can check for yourself what happens by using strace on mount
so that you can see the system call that is actually executed.
For example
	# strace -e mount mount /dev/hda11 /mnt
	mount("/dev/hda11", "/mnt", "bfs", 0xc0ed0000, 0) = 0
