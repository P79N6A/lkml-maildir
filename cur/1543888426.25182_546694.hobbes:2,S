Fair enough. Would you the section name it appears in 'menuconfig'?
I looked under 'Kernel hacking' section (where the slab debugging appears if
slab is turned on as 'Debug slab memory allocation') & in the 'General setup'
section also. I unable to figure out how to disable slub debugging :-(.
Pls give me a pointer to it.
Thanks
(Won't it be right to disable it by default when a user selects slub such that
a user needs to manually turn on the slub debugging in menuconfig?)
