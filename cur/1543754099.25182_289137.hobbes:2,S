Yes, I think you put the finger on it.

I think it's only the tty_ldisc_ref_wait() thing that can deadlock (and 
even that is likely safe if you just specify an order - "masters first" or 
something). Adding a nonblocking "tty_ldisc_ref()" looks safe, ie 
something like the appended.
This has the problem (apart from the fact that it's obviously totally
untested ;) that it looks like every single pty function would need to do
it, so it would be nicer if "tty_ldisc_ref_wait()" would just always get
both references (ie do the ordering). Alan?
