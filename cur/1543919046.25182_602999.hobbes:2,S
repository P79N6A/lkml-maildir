Subject: [PATCH] Correct Makefile rule for generating custom keymap.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

When building a custom keymap, after setting GENERATE_KEYMAP := 1 in
drivers/char/Makefile, the kernel build fails like this:
  CC      drivers/char/vt.o
make[2]: *** No rule to make target `drivers/char/%.map', needed by
`drivers/char/defkeymap.c'.  Stop.
make[1]: *** [drivers/char] Error 2
make: *** [drivers] Error 2
This was caused by commit af8b128719f5248e542036ea994610a29d0642a6,
which deleted a necessary colon from the Makefile rule that generates
the keymap, since that rule contains both a target and a target-pattern.
The following patch puts the colon back:
