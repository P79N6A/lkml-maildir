Strictly speaking for myself: Nothing.
Mr. Akiyama Nobuyuk gave an example from his environment which is cluster systems.
I was the one saying we in our Telco systems could use this feature too.
The only thing Mr. Akiyama Nobuyuk and I have in common is we both would like to do
something before crash dumping, simply because the less mess we will have to cleanup
afterwards in the system taking over, the better.
Mr. Akiyama Nobuyuk operates on SCSI devices to avoid filesystem corruptions.
My usage would be more like notifying external management to get traffic 
redirected to server systems taking over.
