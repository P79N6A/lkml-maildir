If there is a performance hit (there is), it's not bad to have it be an 
option, since some people will choose to go fast ("damn the torpedos, 
full speed ahead). Your point on ifdefs *may* be able to be addressed 
somewhat by putting them in macros, or similar tricks. But some are 
going to be visible even so, and you're right, they are distracting.

I'm curious about this one as well, unless there's some proof that the 
output is "better" by actual analysis, why change? And that's better in 
terms of realized security, not by some change in the 5th insignificant 
digit of a statistical measure.
In general I do like to have the option of more security as a tradeoff, 
even if it is more than is generally needed.
