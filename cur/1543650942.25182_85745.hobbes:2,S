I'm confused, you just said (1) I'm a vendor and then (2) Linus is my
vendor.  And besides, we don't distribute the kernels - we install them on
our own machines, and say 'done'.  The lack of distribution (at least IMO)
should make us not be a vendor.

This isn't about competition.  It's about integrating a core useful
feature that has been shown to be emperically useful by every other person
who writes an OS kernel.

That's not really an option at the moment.  We have a disto vendor
(RedHat) and were dissatisfied with its kernels so we are trying to use
*the*official* kernel (Linus's kernel).

No, vendor == people who sold or gave us the softare.  Right now, Linus is
acting like he's a big evil corporation that won't add the change no
matter what we say:

You know, considering the volume of people on this list that have been
saying "I want it, Linus, please integrated it"  and:

You know, pissing off core developers of projects that have been shown to
be (1) desired (2) potentially useful in Linux, even as an aid to other
Linux subsystem developers and (3) emperically show to be useful for other
Free *nixes such as the BSDs, is not what I would be doing as a project
maintainer.  Of course, I'm not Linus...
