Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Ok this is the collated 'bad bug set', also the -ac diffs divided up
into the relevant sections
Unfixed and definitely needing fixes
o	TCP slow performance problem is still not merged from DaveM
o	Run two processes that keep rejoining multicast groups on an
	SMP box - crash
o	Spam the box remotely with syn floods and other crap, it leaks
	memory
o	select/poll magically break at some number of handles without
	an error
o	Procfs has locking errors on mm's
o	IDE probe often guesses wrong. Linux is impossible to install
	on these ranges of PCs. Needs fixing badly.
o	isdn4linux is old not CVS version. Basically unusable. If its
	not changing for 2.2.0 it should be commented out or deleted
o	eata-dma driver crashes the machine if at any instant it cant
	grab atomic isa dma memory. (Possible fix mark it obsolete and
	use eata.c which works fine)
o	Video4linux bttv tends to crash machines grabbing - fix around
	needs merging and the driver updating
o	You can't mount an ext2fs cdrom. (Block size error). Works in 2.0
o	generic_file_mmap and MSDOS/UMSDOS disagree over who clears
	blocks
o	bootp autobooting stuff corrupts other hosts arp stuff it seems
o	DaveM reports a pile of VMA operations done without locks held.
o	IDE defaults to multimode on causing serial problems, corruption
	with some drives, and hangs on boot with others.
o	Dual 486 boards won't boot SMP kernels
o	Tulip driver/fast routing stuff needs to be resolved. If they cant
	be merged the default tulip should be a current one.
Unfixed but not vital
o	NFS client over tcp doesnt work
o	NFS readahead is too low
o	NFS performance to 8K page sized BSD boxes sucks rocks, 2.0.x
	is about 5 times faster
o	Linus VM is still 20% slower than sct vm on an 8Mb machine
	[benchmarks kernel build and netscape]
o	fchmod on AF_UNIX sockets doesnt work like BSD
o	IPv6 calls set_multicast_list in the wrong context
o	TCP fails to handle small SO_SNDBUF/RCVBUF settings
o	Make xconfig needs layout fixes
o	Need to review all CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL tags
Fixed in -ac patches
For Linus:
o	AVL tree vm avoids bad perfomance problems
o	MediaGX crashes on boot
o	Certain numbers of scsi disks dont seem to work
o	VFS clears setuid/gid flags wrongly on directories
o	COSA credited twice
o	string.h egcs fixes
o	Some further time fixes
o	Various time fixes submitted
o	KNFSD patches. With them knfsd seems to work ok. With the current
	tree it doesnt work at all. Probably this is "Experimental for 2.2"
o	AMD stepping ident, K6 ident
o	What the hell is going on in time.c, on a low memory box picking
	586 gives better performance for a 486 and several other chips
	without TSC registers. That patch piece is a bad way to save 1K
o	Various config combinations don't build
o	FTAPE doesnt work in .132/2.2.0pre
o	Various of the time_* changes to net/* are one out
o	Ted's last serial patch is missing (setserial crashes box)
o	IBMMCA doesnt work on the model 77 internal scsi
o	Trond's last NFS fix
o	include/linux/sysctl.h is exposed to user tasks even with glibc,
	but isnt strictly ANSI compliant
o	SYS5 shm debugging slows stuff down measurably -ifdef it
o	DVD's trip an isofs sanity check wrongly
Unsure:
o	Large file array support (will be required by vendors for several
	big name products). This is a tricky one. Im wearing too many hats
	to judge this objectively. Vendors will probably ship this anyway
	or something similar.
Linus doesnt want:
o	QlogicFC - no big problem, its seperate its clean and vendors
	can ship it and other driver addons easily as they do now. Its a 
	nobrainer to install of the net.
Stale ?:
o	ADFS updates
o	Load unversioned modules into versioned kernels when doing
	request_module etc.
o	Crashes and zero page scribbles using ptrace.
