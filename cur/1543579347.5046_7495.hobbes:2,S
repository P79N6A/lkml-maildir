I guess I can't. But on an idle machine, I would expect a process that
becomes runnable would be run immediately, not on the next clock tick.
strace reports that each select() is taking 0.009xxx seconds of real
time, and the system's CPU load (as reported by top) is under 1%.

OK, if this is the case, how do I alter the scheduling class?
