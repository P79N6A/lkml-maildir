Hi Kevin,
Once again, sorry for the lag.
Since not everybody knows the device-mapper code by heart, I'll add that 
kcopyd is used by the snapshot target to perform copyouts, that is, to 
preserve snapshotted data that would otherwise be overwritten.
Another potential use would be synching in the mirror target.
Regards,
Daniel
