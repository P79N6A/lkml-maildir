    Mmm, I'm confused. As far as I knew, you *should* use symlinks to
your current (running) kernel includes for /usr/include/asm and
/usr/include/linux. I've been doing this for years (in fact I
compiled my libc back in the 2.2 days IIRC), without problems. Why it
should be avoided and what kind of problems may arise if someone
(like me) has those symlinks?
    User space programs should not use kernel headers, so this
shouldn't be a problem, and kernel related tools should use the
headers from the current (running) kernel or a similar version (here
'similar' as a broad meaning, I think, let's say that it means 'same
series as the running kernel, but newer), but I'm afraid I'm missing
something...
    Thanks in advance :)
