yes - i was being too strict. looking at NFSv4 delegations; a read lease does 
not mean there are no writers, it means there are no other clients (fl_owners) 
writing.
the other side of the coin would be break_lease. it should not break a read 
lease on an open for write in the case where the fl_owner of the read lease is 
also the owner of the open for write.
