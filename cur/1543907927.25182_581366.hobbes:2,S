Looking at it more carefully, it turns out that those functions are
not eligible for being paravirt clients. They do no privileged
operation at all. In fact, all they do is bit manipulation.
That said, the code got a little bit cleaner by moving them down, and so I did.
But later on, you voiced concern about making CONFIG_PARAVIRT depend
on !VSMP. (and said it would be okay, because these functions would be
paravirt clients: but they won't) Given this updated picture, what's
your position about this?
Again, as they don't do anything besides bit manipulation, I don't
think they will stop VSMP from working with PARAVIRT.
