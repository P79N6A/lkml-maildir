If we have the call to fcntl, the following happens:
Telnet: SYN
Server: SYN, ACK
T: ACK
S: FIN, ACK
T: FIN, ACK
S: ACK
There was no data exchanged. It just accepted the connection, and then
finished it.
Without the call to fcntl everything goes normally:
T: SYN
S: SYN, ACK
T: ACK
T: PSH, ACK (HTTP request)
S: ACK
S: PSH, ACK (HTTP header)
T: ACK
S: PSH, ACK (data)
T: ACK
S: FIN, ACK
T: ACK
T: FIN, ACK
S: ACK
Thanks in advance,
