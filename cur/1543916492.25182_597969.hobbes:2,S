Hello,
I have an LCD panel on a custom PXA27x based board and it must be turned
on/off by some special commands via a GPIO throught a I2C chip.
I'd like some suggestion about I can easily manage this situation.
Maybe can I add a special I2C function to get i2c_client pointer and then
using it to send on/off commands to the LCD?
Thanks in advance,
Rodolfo
