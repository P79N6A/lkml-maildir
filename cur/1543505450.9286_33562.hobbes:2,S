Hello.  I had just patched my 2.2.9 kernel with patch-2.2.10 and
patch-2.2.11 in that order, and run make menuconfig when it aborted with  
the following error:
 Q> scripts/Menuconfig: MCmenu7: command not found
I was trying to enter the Networking menu when this happened.  It
consistently happend here, and only here.
Sincerely,
Parijat
