Well, I'd rather avoid churn for purely political reasons.  The main
point of my proposal is to move the includes from drivers/ to
include/, but while we're at it me might as well pick a more neutral
directory name.
Moving drivers/infiniband to drivers/rdma has no technical merit right
now, so I'd rather wait and see how it makes sense to organize the
code we end up with.
