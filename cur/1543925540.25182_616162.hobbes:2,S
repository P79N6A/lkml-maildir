My thoughts go more into the direction that we have hundreds of similar 
cases where e.g. a VFS function might currently only by used by OCFS2 
and therefore be dead code for most users, and the only maintainable 
solution will be to solve these at the compiler and/or linker level.

That was an agreement.

Andi scheduled it for removal, and I don't know whether he already has a 
patch.

Read the comment at the top of the xtensa header.  ;-)
For 2.6.25 a better solution is appreciated, but for 2.6.24 such a small 
dirty workaround that can't cause breakages on other architectures would 
be better.
