I don't think it is a client congestion issue at this point.  I can run the 
test with just one client on UDP and achieve 11.2 MB/sec with just one mount 
point.  The client has 100 Mbit Ethernet, so should be the upper limit (or 
really close).  In the 40 client read test, I have only achieved 2.875 MB/sec 
per client.  That and the fact that there are never more than 2 nfsd threads 
in a run state at one time (for UDP only) leads me to believe there is still 
a scaling problem on the server for UDP.  I will continue to run the test and 
poke a prod around.  Hopefully something will jump out at me.  Thanks for all 
the input!
