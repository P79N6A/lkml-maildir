I didn't see anything about doing that in-kernel.

It's similar to the way a lot of things work in Linux: you have to let 
operations run to completion so they can let go of resources.  One day we'll 
be able to shoot down transfers in mid-flight, but I doubt that's going to 
happen in this cycle.
So in general, the idea is: let any outstanding operations complete, but feed 
them errors.  What else can we do?
I don't see this as heavyweight at all.  Policy stays in user space, and a 
lightweight error path lives in the kernel.
