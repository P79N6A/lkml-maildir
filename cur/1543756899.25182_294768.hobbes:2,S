Yes, sorry, my bad wording.  This is kernel 2.6.4 from kernel.org.  I meant 
_my_ 'current' tree that runs perfect on the 233 box.  I can't seem to 
upgrade to later 2.6.x kernels as I get curious swapd oops after a few hours, 
but that is another story.
So I can ignore the debug prints?
Thanks,
Nick
