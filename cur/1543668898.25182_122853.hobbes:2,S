I see two problems with objrmap - this search, and the complexity of the
interworking with nonlinear mappings.
There is talk going around about implementing some more sophisticated search
structure thatn a linear list.
And treating the nonlinear mappings as being mlocked is a great
simplification - I'd be interested in Ingo's views on that.
