 Give the current -ac a spin and tell me if it works/doesnt and if not how
> it fails
I tried 2.4.4-ac8.
It still hangs during boot if compiled for Athlon, but also crashes after a
while if compiled for 586. (I did a bonnie, did it a second time. The second
run doesn´t finished.) It is a complete system freeze, magic sysrq doesn´t
work.
Now i am going to try the new bios with a new version of the via fix. I will
report if this solution fix it for me/us.
greetings
