I don't think so.  It should cause either no corruption or at least 8 bytes worth
(it does pairs of 4 byte writes).  What you might see is an Oops when it tries to
write the first 4 bytes at the start of a page, because of a page fault, but then
the write doesn't happen and there is no corruption...
Best wishes,
Duncan.
