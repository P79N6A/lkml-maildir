Thanks for this information.
While looking at the code, I also noted the following:
quirk_sis_96x_compatible() is pretty useless since all it does is to set 
a static variable that is only used in a printk().
quirk_sis_96x_compatible() was added with:

    [PATCH] i2c: Add SiS96x I2C/SMBus driver
    This patch adds support for the SMBus of SiS96x south
    bridges.  It is based on i2c-sis645.c from the lm sensors
    project, which never made it into an official kernel and
    was anyway mis-named.
    This driver works on my SiS 645/961 board vs w83781d.
It's usage in
static void __init quirk_sis_503_smbus(struct pci_dev *dev)
{
       if (sis_96x_compatible)
               quirk_sis_96x_smbus(dev);
}

    Stop SIS 96x chips from lying about themselves.
    
    Some machines with the SIS 96x southbridge have it set up
    to claim it is a SIS 503 chip. That breaks irq routing logic
    among other things. Fix it properly by making everybody aware
    of the duplicity.
Was this intentional (and quirk_sis_96x_compatible() should be removed), 
or is this a bug that should be fixed?
