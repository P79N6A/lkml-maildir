NFS v2/3 have a limit of gids that can be passed. I know on v2 it is limited
to 16. If the group that is permitted access is not in that list, then file
access will fail, even though the user IS supposed to have access. The list
of groups that is allowed is only the first 16 of a potentially very large
list.

Then you don't understand the problem yet. Just because UIDs don't show up
properly on the client is no reason to map them in an insecure manner. And
it has nothing to do with house doors or TV sets.
