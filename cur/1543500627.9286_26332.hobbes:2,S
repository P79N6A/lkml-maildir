Hi there!
I recently tested the WebDAV extensions to Windows and well, it's cool :)
I am not wondering if anyone wants to do something like that under
Linux (means, writing a webdav filesystem which acts as a client.
A webdav server in addition to NFS would maybe also be interesting
but maybe not that important..)
Or if someone maybe has started already..
For anyone not knowing what DAV is: It stands for "Distributed
Authoring and Versioning" and is an extension to HTTP which allows
read/write access for web servers and thus replacing proprietary
protocols like FrontPage Server Extensions and the like.
Of course it is not bound to it's use for web servers but also for
any other types of file sharing.
More information about WebDAV:

best,
  Christian
PS: I am quite interested in it as I am right now writing a shared
    workspace software which will then also act as DAV server and it
    would be cool to test it all under Linux.
