I see.
BTW, the name `enable' seems to be a misnomer -- `enable' implies that it
forces the depends to be y, but not that it also forces the _value_.
Why not have two:
  enable FOO	- forces the `depends' value of FOO to y
		  but it will still prompt
  force FOO	- forces both the `depends' and value of FOO to y
		  prompting for FOO is turned off
