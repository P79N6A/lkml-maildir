Hi,
I just had an MCE on my aging PPro 200. Before I go out to
buy a replacement I would like to hear if it could be
caused by anything other than the CPU. Googling a bit
gave some indications that sometimes other HW might report
failure through this method.
The MCE (hand copied):
Machine Check Exception: 000000000000004
Bank 4: b200000000040151
Kernel panic: CPU context corrupt
Regards,
  Rasmus
