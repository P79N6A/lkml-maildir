Certainly giving it a higher priority should improve results (especially
with preemption), but the application should receive a fair amount of
process attention as it is, as it is TASK_RUNNABLE at all times and the
disk I/O should be routinely preempted.  I am interested how much
renicing it helps, though.
Now, if it has to swap pages, that is a very good point.  I tend to
blame this, or perhaps something with a long held lock (the audio
driver?) for the blips.
Its so hard to tell swap/VM issues now with all the VM work, sadly...:)
