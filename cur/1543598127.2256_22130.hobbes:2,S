Hi, I reported a problem with compiling the AIC7xxx deal the other day.
You suggested,"If you manually go into drivers/scsi/aic7xxx/aicasm and do a 
make clean, the error should go away."
OK, that worked.  But now I have undefined symbols in the driver which causes
a kernel panic when I boot up because it's my root device.
Here are the ones I was able to write down:
(undefined symbols in):
scsi_unregister_Rsmp_8dcd2990
scsi_register_Rsmp_5f04f644
scsi_unregister_module_Rsmp_81d85a75
scsi_report_bus_reset_Rsmp_5024965f
scsi_block_requests_Rsmp_43878139
scsi_partsize_Rsmp_276f0d01
scsi_register_module_Rsmp_fa20b7b0
Yeah, it's SMP. Hope this helps.
