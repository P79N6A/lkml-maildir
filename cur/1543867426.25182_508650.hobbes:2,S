I do think worth pointing out that, quite significantly, you can now
use git-daemon to push changes into a repo, something very handy for
private networks.
This is enabled by passing the --enable=receive-pack to the
git-daemon (usually in the [x]?inetd configuration).
This has the benefit of:
  1) More efficient git transport for both pushes and pulls.
  2) A less ugly URL to use: git://server/repo, instead of, say,
     ssh+git://server/path/to/repos/repo.
  3) Ability to easily move your repo without changing the URL in each
     client, by changing the URL in the git-daemon config file
     (xinetd) --- say, if you want to move your repo to a striped
     disk, or similar.
