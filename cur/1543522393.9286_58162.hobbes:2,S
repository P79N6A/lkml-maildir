Above.net has blocked ORBS for it's own servers. mail.linux.com is NOT blocked.
Even more: it's tested by ORBS and added to ORBS whitelist (*.ok.orbs.org.).
But since above.net's netblocks are added in ORBS blacklist (type 4 aka
"netblock") and most systems do not use ORBS whitelist but use just ORBS
blacklist without paying attention to record type (it's in ORBS's samples)
mail.linux.com is effectively blocked.

Above.net doesn't give ORBS way to make sure SOME of their hosts don't relay.
For some hosts (like mail.linux.com) such access is granted, systems was probed
and listed in ORBS's whitelist.

The question is "HOW" you are using ORBS. Do you check ONLY ORBS's blacklist
or whitelist too ?
