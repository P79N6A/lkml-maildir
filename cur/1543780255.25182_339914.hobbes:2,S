Hello,
In january of this year I mentioned a problem with the Linux kernel
driver for VIA Rhine ethernet chips. (see 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2005/1/15/47
)
In the mean time this bug was reproduced quite a number of times on my
Fedora Core 3 (then)/4 (now) box (a VIA CL6000).
An alternative driver by VIA was used (with kernel 2.6.1x,
http://www.viaarena.com/downloads/Source/rhinefet.tgz
); this VIA driver
did not have the Oversized ethernet frame bug but consumes quite a lot
of CPU when transfering a steady stream of a few 1000 KB/S, so it is no
good solution.
Since the ethernet connection goes down due to this bug I think I can
mark the bug as critical. The bug is still present in 2.6.12.
The maintainer of the driver cannot fix the bug. Who can?
Please post here and/or email me with your thoughts about a solution,
ways of fixing the bug. Would a small reward help?
Kind regards,
Udo
