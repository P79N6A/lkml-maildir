Subject: [GIT PATCH] PCI fixes for 2.6.24-git
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/2/2/285

Here are some PCI patches against your 2.6.24 git tree.
They rip out the PCIE ASPM patch, as it was causing both build errors,
and run-time oopses, fixes a build error in the scsi tree caused by a
clueless kernel developer who forgot to check in his fix on his
machine[1], and 2 patches to fix some of the section warnings in the PCI
code that are now showing up.
Please pull from:
	master.kernel.org:/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/pci-2.6.git/
The full patches will be sent to the linux-pci mailing list, if anyone
wants to see them.
thanks,
greg k-h
[1] yeah, that was me, ugh...
