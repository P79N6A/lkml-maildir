Sounds like /etc/fstab corruption to me. Try this:
# mount -n /proc /proc -t proc
# mount /dev/hda4 -t ext2 -o remount,ro /
# mount -f /proc /proc -t proc
If it works, you have fstab corruption
If it doesn't, the problem lies elsewhere.
Yes I know that mount shouldn't require all that for
a remount. I'm probably way out on a limb on this one.
I still can't figure out what this has to do with klibc.
