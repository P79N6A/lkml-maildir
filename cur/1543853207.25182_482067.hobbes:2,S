The Avermedia 777 is working perfectly again with the current v4l-dvb tree. No 
more misbehaviours. Looks like you guys addressed and resolved the issue 
quite fast :)
At the moment I can't give the remote control a try because lirc doesn't 
compile against version 2.6.18 of the kernel. If that lirc issue gets solved, 
I will try to use it as soon as I can.
All the best.
