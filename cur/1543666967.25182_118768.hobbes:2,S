Well, going back to his original email,
jbglaw@schnarchnase:/tmp$ uname -a
Linux schnarchnase 2.5.65 #1 Thu Mar 20 07:39:11 CET 2003 i486 unknown 
unknown GNU/Linux
And looking on kernel.org,
Mar 17 22:29 linux-2.5.65.tar.gz
It takes him less than a week anyway*... ;)  (Timezone conversions left 
as an exercise to the reader.)
So, who can beat his 15.10 bogomips?  Anyone run <1 bogomips?
*grin*
Eli
* Yes, I know he could be doing patches and incremental builds.
