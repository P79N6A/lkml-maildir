Thanks a lot for your report. We were waiting for somebody to get fs in this
state (because we cannot reproduce problem locally).
How big your root partition is?

Can you please send us image of your root partition, if it is not big,
or at least the metadata snapshot.
(you can get metadata snapshot by running 
debugreiserfs  -p  /dev/xxx  |gzip -c >metadata.gz)
You need to make this with filesystem unmounted.
Thank you.
Bye,
    Oleg
