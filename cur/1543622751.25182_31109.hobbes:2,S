I was thinking that some part(s) of the proc-fs code might call
fs/proc/generic.c::proc_file_read() multiple times (internally),
but no, it's just the application (or libc) doing it AFAICT.
app. calls read() [Key data: with offset=0], which calls sys_read(),
which calls proc_file_read(), which returns N bytes, and then
proc_file_read() and sys_read() and read() return to the app.
When the app. gets N bytes of actual data on its read(), it
doesn't know whether it was at EOF or not, so it tries another
read() [with offset=N], and sys_read() calls proc_file_read()
again, both of which return 0, so the app. knows that there
is no more data.
