And to further test this whole -stable system, I've released 2.6.11.2.
It contains one patch, which is already in the -bk tree, and came from
the security team (hence the lack of the longer review cycle).
It's available now in the normal kernel.org places:
	kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/patch-2.6.11.2.gz
which is a patch against the 2.6.11.1 release.  If consensus arrives
that this patch should be against the 2.6.11 tree, it will be done that
way in the future.
A detailed changelog can be found at:
 	kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/ChangeLog-2.6.11.2
A bitkeeper tree for the 2.6.11.y releases can be found at:
	bk://linux-release.bkbits.net/linux-2.6.11
The diffstat and short summary of the fixes are below.  
I'll also be replying to this message with a copy of the patch itself,
as it is small enough to do so.
thanks,
greg k-h
