Right, but it should be possible to ensure (by using a special encoding)
that a part of the erased block can be detected as empty or already
occupied by reading just a few bytes. Sure this is a tradeoff but one
I'd be willing to make. :)

My bad, I thought you're using the term reiserfs also for reiser4. I was
always talking about reiser4 when I said reiserfs.

Only when the data is in motion. Considering that most of the data is
quite fixed with only some bytes of configuration being written a few
times and an update of a few packages every now and then I'm pretty sure
the wear affect will hardly hit. It's more important, that the
configuration bits are spread evenly over the full filesystem.

Yes. Especially startup times are important to us but also execution
times for cachecold executables.

This are VIA Eden boxes with 667 Mhz fanless x86 compatible CPUs. They
come in a booksize chassis and deliver pretty impressive performance for
their size.

No it's not. Especially the fsck annoyance is a real killer because we
can either not run it, thereby risking an inconsistent filesystem or run
it unattended thereby risking a loss of files.

I'm aware, thanks. :)

I've some doubts that placing blocks close to another wears out all of
the flash equally. I imagine something like circular or hashed block
allocator which ensures equal wear leveling taking the erasesize of the
flash into account.
