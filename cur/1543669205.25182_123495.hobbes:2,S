Crap.  Since hch removed the other module ops, if your module does its
own refcount THAT won't compile in 2.5.

This is complete crap.  It's an obfuscation macro, with no backwards
compatibility capabilities as currently implemented.
Christoph went through and substituted try_inc_mod_count to
try_module_get, for no gain, and broke backwards compatibility.
Unlike that, substituting dev->owner = THIS_MODULE; has no backwards
compatibility loss, and it removes a confusing and pointless macro
which *never* had a point.
Unless you can come up with a real *reason*, I'll move it back under
"deprecated" and start substituting.
Cheers,
Rusty.
