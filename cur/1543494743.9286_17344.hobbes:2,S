This is a highly debated issue and hastable "experts" disagree.
The `mod 2^n' problem only shows up if your hash value (before modulus)
has a tendency to show some kind of cyclic behavior with cycles of size
2^m.  In such a case a `mod prime' will avoid collisions and spread your
data much better.
But if your hash function doesn't suffer from such a 2^m problem, then
`mod 2^n' will work just fine.
What it usually boils down to is whether one wants to use fast bit-twiddling
operations in the hash-function (leading to 2^m artifacts) but with a slow
`mod prime' at the end or whether one prefers a fast `mod 2^n' but with
either a higher collision rate or with a slow hash-function that randomizes
more carefully (using operations such as multiplication by a prime number
or table lookups) in order not to suffer from 2^m artifacts.
I believe the hash function used by Chuck Lever uses the latter approach
(with a multiplication by a prime number).  This also saves you from
the burden of having to find the next prime number.  Also a multiplication
by a big prime constant is usually faster than finding a (non-constant)
modulus.
