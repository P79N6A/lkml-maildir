Hi -
A colleague has asked me to find out the default ARP cache timeout and how
to change it under Linux.
It would appear that it was 60 seconds under kernels <=2.0.x   and was
configurable by altering a #define and recompiling, but things appear to
have changed substantially in kernel 2.2.x.
Please can someone explain the current behaviour to me?
Best Regards,
Alex.
