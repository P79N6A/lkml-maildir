  Unless you want -rt to suffer the fate of -ck, keep upstream involved 
  all the time. The recent /proc/interrupts-all discussion with upstream 
  folks showed the clear benefits of that approach. ]

why do we need this? It's quite complex and brings little extra AFAICS. 
See the "schedule_on_each_cpu-enhance.patch" from Peter Ziljstra that 
lets a function to be executed on all CPUs. That should be extended 
(trivially) to execute a function on another CPU. That's all we need.
