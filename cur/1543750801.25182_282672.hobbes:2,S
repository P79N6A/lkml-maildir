i386 machines have had interrupt controllers and "large scale" systems
(to the extent that 32-bit machines can be so) developed for some time.
x86-64 machines are newer, and it is the maintainer's preference to
start with a fresh codebase for the APIC.
So what you see is not a reflection of x86-64's capabilities, but
rather, of the newness of the architecture and the codebase's desire
to be "legacy-free" in manners that don't pose the threat of causing
immediate problems.
It is not now limiting the capabilities of x86-64 machines because
x86-64 machines of 64 cpus or larger have yet to be produced. For the
record, I'm unaware of SSI i386 machines larger than 64 processors.
255 represents nothing more than a theoretical limit of hardware
capabilities, and no i386 machine larger than 64 processors has ever
been constructed to the best of my knowledge.
