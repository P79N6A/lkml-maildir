not to mention that utrace could be used to move most of the ELF 
coredumping code out of the kernel. (the moment you have access to all 
crashed threads userspace can construct its own coredump - instead of 
having the kernel construct a coredump file) Roland's patch does not go 
as far yet, but it could be a possible target.
