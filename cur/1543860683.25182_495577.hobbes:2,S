Hello Ingo,
In the mean time I have tested more with this problem:
1. Once, the RTC clock gets stopped during shutdown, it is **NEVER**
going to run again.
And I continuously see the problems with grub and the BIOS
time-of-day. Finally I had to remove the battery from the motherboard
to reset the RTC clock (Nothing else worked, even total poweroff). Now
it is ticking again... until...
2. Using a kernel without CONFIG_NO_HZ seems to solve all the problems
with the RTC clock, even hwclock functions normally.
With CONFIG_NO_HZ enabled, the problem with hwclock **only** occurs
when it is called for the first time by the init scripts, directly
after kernel boot. Every sub sequential call to hwclock show normal
times like your measurement.
Best Regards and also a Happy New Year,
Remy
