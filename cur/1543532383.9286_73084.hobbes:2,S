Hello!
> Is check_region() obsolete?
   Yes, just use the return value of request_region().

   Yes.

   No, in hotplug environment the devices can be removed in any order,
therefore you can get any sequence of probes and removes and the only
thing you can rely on is that nobody will remove a device which was
not inserted ;-)

   I guess you need your device list for associating your private data
structures with the device for which purpose you can easily use
pci_dev->driver_data.
				Have a nice fortnight
