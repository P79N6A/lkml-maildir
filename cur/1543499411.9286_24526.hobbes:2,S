Except with this scheme you still have the perms/uids/gids problem which
leads to nasty tarball hacks inbetween reboots. Remember symlinks obtain
the permissions of what they point to but /devfs is virtual and will not
preserve permissions when the system is down.

It's also messy, because /dev entries don't go away when they are not in
the system or unavailable for another reason (say, suspended, or powered
down). It also doesn't address the issue of automatic device creation if
you access a non-existant entry in /dev (and glibc hacks are more odious
than kernel hacks here). Also it means you have a symlink lookup on each
node access, which is vaguely stupid. Also I don't think there are gains
from a symlink tree in /dev: the problems have just been moved from /dev
to /devfs, but they are still the same problems (policy in /devfs should
be avoided just as much as policy in /dev).
I don't like this scheme at all. It's messy, gains little, loses much, &
adds complexity without solving the real problems (naming policy isn't a
kernel issue, preserving permissions over reboots, automatic device node
creation upon access, removing stale nodes when module is gone).
