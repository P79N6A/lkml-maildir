Ok, so an ipsec change. And I see from the history below it
really has nothing to do with this problem. it seems the problem
has something to do with changes between 2.6.19.1 and 2.6.19.2.
There were no changes to XFS between 2.6.19.1 and 2.6.19.2,
so I'm thinking that your problems are related to something
other than XFS. Can you do a git bisect to determine what the
bad patch is?

Except that the trigger might be on-disk corruption so we
need to rule that out first.

Yes, you need to run xfs_repair.
Cheers,
