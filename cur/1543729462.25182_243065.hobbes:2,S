I've made available a patch that creats a keyfs filesystem on top of my key
management stuff. The patch can be downloaded from:

    Signed-Off-By: David Howells <dhowells@redhat.com>
For those who think a filesystem is the right interface for everything,
despite it being ~18KB to the ~4KB required for a syscall interface, and
_much_ less efficient generally in to the bargain.
