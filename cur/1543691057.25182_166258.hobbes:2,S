Hi,
Just retested it with 2.6.0-test4.
This time, the kernel did *NOT* log any of the messages as it did with test1,
BUT: if I compare the original with the new file, I get differences all over
the place.
So what I did was (just in case):
# create backup image
truncate /data2/backup.udf 4294967296
mkudffs /data2/backup.udf
# mount it & copy data
mount -o loop -t udf /data2/backup.udf /mnt
(cd /data/backup/Backup ; tar cf - *) | (cd /mnt ; tar xvf -)
umount /mnt
# verify things
mount -o loop -t udf /data2/backup.udf /mnt
cd /mnt
find . -type f |xargs -n 1 ./docmp
docmp is:
--------
echo $1
cmp -l /mnt/$1 /data/backup/Backup/$1

p.s.: truncate is an utility which is available on most BSD systems (not mac
      os x which is a BSD). I wrote a version for linux:

 (64bit safe)
