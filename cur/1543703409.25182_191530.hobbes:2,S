Sure, this is important.

We were looking at extending the boot loader (grub/lilo) to have
additional support for R1 & multipath. (ie, booting from the first
drive/path in the set where a consistent image can be read.) If the BIOS
supports DDF too, this would get even better.
For the boot drive, this is highly desireable!
Do you know whether DDF can also support simple multipathing?

This is needed with DDF too; we need to parse the DDF data somewhere
afterall.

Supporting additional metadata is desireable. For 2.6, this is already
in the code, and I am looking forward to having this feature.

I don't think so. But for 2.6, the functionality should go either into
DM or MD, not into emd. I don't care which, really, both sides have good
arguments, none of which _really_ matter from a user-perspective ;-)
(If, in 2.7 time, we rip out MD and fully integrate it all into DM, then
we can see further.)
