Usually when I hear stand-alone program I think of program that runs
without the need of a kernel.  You have an environment in that context?

Be very careful.  Generally I think at least until the filesystem
is very stable running your filesystem server in the kernel is a mistake.
And the concept of a parallel filesystem with just one server just
sounds wrong from any context.
