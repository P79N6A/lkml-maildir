Fair enough, though one line like '(sleep 60; twistd ...) & in
/etc/init.d/boot.local would have been a bit simpler for a quick and
dirty autoinstall .sh script (that's the simplest way I install it in my system).

Client completely stateless couldn't get right suspend to disk as far as
I can tell.
Tiny C program will be less tiny than the current tac file and the
package would immediately become arch dependent. Plus if you want to run
it as user nobody the twistd -u/g --pidfile --logfile and all the rest
in twisted make life so much easier. On my systems I've other services
running in background with twistd so perhaps I'm biased because I share
almost all of it ;).

I'm not very optimistic about the depdency chain to be distro
indipendent, but I will look into that shortly and I guess here I'm
running a bit offtopic.
Thanks!
