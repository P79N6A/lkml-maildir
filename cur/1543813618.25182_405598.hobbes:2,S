Yes, right. In your way, there is no thrashing. but it slows booting.
I mean, there is a trade-off between booting and after booted.
But, what people would want is always both, not either.
Especially, your way has problem if you boot( resume ) not from HDD
but for example, from NFS server or CD-R or even from Internet.

Could I have URL or title of the paper?
