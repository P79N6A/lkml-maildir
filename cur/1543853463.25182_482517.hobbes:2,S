Hello,
The kernel (2.6.18.1-something) asked me to report this  :)
"PCI: Bus #04 (-#07) is hidden behind transparent bridge #03 (-#04) (try
'pci=assign-busses')
Please report the result to linux-kernel to fix this permanently"
I've attached the dmesg and lspci with and without pci=assign-busses.
Also for future reference I opened #7528 .

Please let me know if you need more data.
Thank you for the great work,
