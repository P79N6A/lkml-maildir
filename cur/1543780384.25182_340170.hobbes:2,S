Ah, so the whole idea was to inc/dec nr_files less often so
that we reduce contention on filp_count_lock, right ? This however
causes skews nr_files by the size of the slab array, AFAICS.
Since we check nr_files before we allocate files from slab, the
check seems inaccurate.
Anyway, I guess, I need to look at scaling the file counting
first.
Thanks
