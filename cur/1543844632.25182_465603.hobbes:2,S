most of the vmalloc area that is allocated on a typical system are 
modules - and they get loaded on bootup and rarely unloaded. Even for 
other vmalloc-ed areas like netfilter, the activation of them is during 
bootup. So from that point on the number of vmalloc faults is quite low. 
(zero on most systems) If you still want to trace it i'd suggest a 
separate type of event for it.
(meanwhile i remember why i implemented vmalloc faults to begin with: 
during vmalloc() we used to have a for_each_process() over all 
kernel-pagetables of tasks to fix up their pagetables. This caused both 
high latencies and overhead back in the days when we still were frequent 
vmalloc()ers.)
