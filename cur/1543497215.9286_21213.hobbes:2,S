As far as I know there would be two ways to detect hercules :
* Detecting with different video memory size (write a byte, read back, compare)
* There is a bit on a hercules port which inditcated vertical (or horizontal)
  retrace. This technique is used in mdacon to detect hercules.
(A nice question : what are hercules plus and hercules color ? I haven't
 managed to seek any information on them ...)

I hard-wired some settings on my Linux machine with only a hercules display
(instead of auto detecting) :
display_desc="*HGC";
request_region(0x3b0,16,"hgc");
vga_vram_base=0xb0000;
vga_vram_address=0xb8000;
vga_hardscroll_enabled=1;
The result was strange ... On screen scrolling everything messed up :(
Changing VT away and back fix the problem till the next scroll event.
[Temporary I created a syscall to controll my kernel changes :) and without
enabling hardscroll on HGC everything worked OK with my console changes
too. So the problem is with hardscroll on hgc.]
However creating kernel parameter to force using HGC (with hardscroll)
is a good idea, I think.

I don't think so because this is not that type of noise. Playing can be skipped
for even seconds when scrolling display. Less agressive screen changing
casues only strange noise. I heard that it is casued by the ISA arhitecture
(it does not matter when I played with PCI/ISA pair of card instead of
ISA/ISA ...)
