Meanwhile, I've been working on v0.6 of kdb for 2.2.13 and
am reorganizing kdb sources to split into machine dependent and
machine independent parts, with rudimentary mips and itanium support, which
will become version v1.0 of kdb and will be relative to the 
2.3 series kernels.  
I expect v0.6 to release the first week or two of november, and 
v1.0 to release in early december.
