I'm slightly concerned about this, because we *do* use VBE2 data - just 
not the stuff that this particular BIOS seems to key on (and break.)
On the other hand, until we get an example on something that breaks with 
the change, we might as well try it, since we have an example on 
something that breaks with it.  We should monitor carefully, though.
