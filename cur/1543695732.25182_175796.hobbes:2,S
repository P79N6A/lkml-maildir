Given that it is a year out of date and general in nature, it's still a
pretty useful docuement to someone who does a lot of fiddling anyway.
But what I think would be very useful would be a small (one screen?)
HTML doc with links to versions which are current today, one page each
for a few major distros covering tweaks to startup file and the like,
and a page of things which aren't mentioned in the post Halowe'en doc,
like the things that aren't available in modules anymore.
Anyway, since I found that even my notes were out of date, and I took
them as I moved machines from 2.5.4x forward to test9, I thought it
would be useful. I'll probably do something for my friends and clients,
but it will definitely be Redhat and Slackware only. I see no enthusiasm
for helping users instead of letting them thrash.
