Hello,
does anybody know a _reliable_ way to determine the version the kernel
that produced a vmcore file? This means not scanning for a specific
string or something like that which can fail on random memory.
Would it make sense to add a ELF PT_NOTE section in the vmcore?
Thanks for input!
Thanks,
   Bernhard
