agreed ...
i really find it so disheartening at times that people fight trivial 
usability additions tooth and nail in a _9 million lines of code_ kernel 
with a ... "bloat" argument.
Lets face it: Linux is _still_ hard and a pain to administer, our kernel 
boot parameters are ad-hoc, they dont match up to the .config parameters 
and it is all a total mess. There's absolutely no design behind them 
(look at all the inconsistent parameter forms for turning off smp, acpi, 
hpet, nohz, etc.).
if RAM overhead of a new boot option would really be an issue on smaller 
setups then the right solution is to make a new .config option that 
hardcodes a specific command line and _disable_ all the commandline 
parsing. That would also be a nice security feature for certain setups 
and would save _a lot more_ RAM than another rejected boot parameter. 
Really, all the 'bloat' based objections are totally, utterly silly.
i had a similar experience when i added the relatime boot option:
  
http://people.redhat.com/mingo/relatime-patches/improve-relatime.patch
Look back the lkml discussion for all the "bloat" and "use /etc/fstab" 
clowning around that happened when i sent that patch ... and we still 
have no good configuration vectors to turn atime off. I'd rate it good 
comedy that happened around that patch: "Kernel hackers shoot in their 
own foot and are proud of it".
multiple, consistent vectors for configurability are _GOOD_. That was 
the success story behind Apache. Forcing everyone into a "you must use 
an initrd for this" idea is 80's thinking and actively harmful to Linux.
