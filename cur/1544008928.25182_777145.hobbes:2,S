SELinux is insanely complicated, and is sort of a blanket fix, it does
not fix the problem at the root, in the target application.

This would only be dangerous if the parent did not wait for the child to
finish its task before changing its uid, which for a FastCGI app, it has
to as it needs the response to send back to the client. All that would
happen here is the CGI script would sleep forever, or until the HTTP
server killed the process.

Same as above, it would just sleep forever.

I dont exactly like the idea of disabling system functions, its more of
a hack then a solution, it was just a suggestion.

Thats fine, I dont want to make things less secure, bear in mind that
this is my first kernel patch, and I am still learning how things are
written in the kernel.
