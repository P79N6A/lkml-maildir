If this only has to work on an ix86 machine, you could put a few longwords
of data in CMOS. Every recent machine I've seen has plenty of room. The
only problem is finding out how the BIOS checksums the current contents.
You only have to do this once, but it has to be done. Some checksum the
entire data area, some only checksum from the top of the 'clock' to the
end of their data. You have to find out what works because you have
to checksum using the BIOS protocol or else the next boot will fail due
to a checksum error. Because this has to be compatible amongst many
BIOSes, it has to do the initial 'protocol' check at runtime.
