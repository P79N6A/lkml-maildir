I told you -- I have this in the struct asd_ha_struct and it was merely
a downplay that I didn't include the same thing in struct sas_ha_struct.

No, this is the solution which would turn everything upside down.
The easiest and smallest solution is to just include this tiny struct
and end this.  It would have 0 impact on code.  In fact I'll
implement it now and push it to the git tree. ;-)
The host template _mixes_ hw, scsi core, and protocol knowlege into
one ugly blob.  I've given this argument before, several times.

libata isn't without architectural problems.  What strikes me is
that you think that libata-scsi is SATL.
You are so much better off renaming it to satl.c and given
the knowlege you've gained over the years and the backing you have
from engineers from companies, start with it at device level.  I, as
I'm sure other (not to name names) will be more than happy to contribute
if you started this.
