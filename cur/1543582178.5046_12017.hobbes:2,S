	Linux bonding is compat with Sun EtherTrunking and Cisco
EtherChannel/FastEtherChannel.
	On the Cisco side you follow their setup examples, *except*
you *must* trun keepalives off on the cisco.  These are a Cisco
extension.  If you fail to do this the Cisco will toggle the
onterfaces *off* every 10 - 30 seconds.
