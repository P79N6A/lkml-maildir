Yes (no to the no): Manfred's pseudo-code is exactly the question you're
asking.  Because when the TLB entry is non-dirty and you do a write, we
_know_ the processor will do a locked memory cycle to update the dirty
bit.  A locked memory cycle implies read-modify-write, not "write TLB
entry + dirty" (which would be a plain write) or anything like that.
Given you know it's a locked cycle, the only sensible design from Intel
is going to be one of Manfred's scenarios.
An interesting thought experiment though is this:
<< lock;
read pte
pte |= dirty
write pte
>> end lock;
if (!present(pte))
	do_page_fault();
It would have a mighty odd effect wouldn't it?
