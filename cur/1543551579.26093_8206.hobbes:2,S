Wouldn't it be easyer to add a "has_safe_mediachange:" method to
block_device_operations, which would reply 1 for devices that can
safely hang on to their cached data between lastcloses, and 0 for
those where it is problematic.  And if the method is not defined at
all, assume 0 and play it safe (thus removing the need to update all
drivers all at once).
That way, slow devices that do not have partitions, and do have
reliable disk change detection (or a fallback mechanism a la
FD_BROKEN_DCL) are not penalized.

Alain
