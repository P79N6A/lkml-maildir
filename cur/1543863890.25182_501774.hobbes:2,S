Subject: [PATCH] Don't allow the stack to grow into hugetlb reserved regions
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/1/25/251

When expanding the stack, we don't currently check if the VMA will cross into
an area of the address space that is reserved for hugetlb pages.  Subsequent
faults on the expanded portion of such a VMA will confuse the low-level MMU
code, resulting in an OOPS.  Check for this.
