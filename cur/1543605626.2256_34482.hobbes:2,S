I tried out your patch yesterday with 2.4.13-pre6 (it applies cleanly to 
-pre6 although made for -pre5). I've been running with it for about a 
day now and I have not seen any ill effects yet.
The system does seem slightly more responsive when stressed, but I don't 
see (or feel) huge improvements like some other people - maybe I just 
run a set of apps that don't benefit much from the preempt patches, or 
my workload is not significant enough to notice.. I usually run things 
like KDE2, XMMS, Nedit, x-cd-roast, Opera, Sylpheed and a lot of console 
windows.
This is on a 1.4Ghz Athlon Thunderbird with 512MB RAM.
Are there any tests you'd like me to try out on this box?
