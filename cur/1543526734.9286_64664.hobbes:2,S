I recently upgraded from 2.2.14 to 2.3.46, and I can't seem to find my
atapi floppy drive (zip 100, internal ide). kernel seems to find it:
hdd: IOMEGA ZIP 100 ATAPI, ATAPI FLOPPY drive
hdd: 98304kB, 32/64/96 CHS, 4096 kBps, 512 sector size, 2941 rpm
hdd: The drive reports both 100663296 and 0 bytes as its capacity
devfs doesn't create an entry for it, at least that I can find.
[root@sliver:/dev/ide/host0/bus1/target1/lun0]# ls -l
total 0
So, I tried making a device, block major 22, minor 64.. mounted a vfat zip
disk.. mounts fine, do an ls on it, only files with ??.?? 
Reboot to win98.. try the same zip disk, can read it, looks fine.
I'm guessing ide floppy is broken in 2.3.46, but I haven't seen any
messages about it. If anyone has any ideas, or can confirm that it just
doesn't work, that'd be great.
Thanks everyone.
