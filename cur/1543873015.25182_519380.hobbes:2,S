Really truly?   I think we have a _lot_ of declarations which omit the section
qualifier altogether.  How come they don't all break too?
(ARM (at least) in fact does require the section tagging on the declaration as
well as the definition, but we've thus far only fixed that in a couple of places
which were causing breakage).
