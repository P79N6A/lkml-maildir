I have looked at/for it -- the crash appears to be a crash in the write
method for the kernel-to-user pipe -- but am looking somewhat in the
dark because I cannot reproduce it.
I would appreciate any and all information that you can possibly give
me, as well as a copy of your kernel binary, System.map file, and
preferrably a tar of your build tree.
I'm out of town right now but will be back Saturday.
