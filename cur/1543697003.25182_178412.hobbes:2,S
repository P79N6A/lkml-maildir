What is the status of dpt_i2o with the 2.6 kernel?  Has any work been
done to improve its non-x86 arch compatibility?
I am concerned here because my new servers have Adaptec 2110S SCSI RAID
controllers less than 6 months old, and it appears that as of the next
release of Fedora Core I will no longer be able to upgrade my servers
due to the lack of dpt_i2o driver.
I am also disheartened that the dpt_i2o driver never did seem to work in
alternate architectures.
