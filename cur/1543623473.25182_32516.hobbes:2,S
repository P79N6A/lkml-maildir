Honestly, I think that most people want to know if the system they've setup 
is overcommited at as early a point as possible: a UML failing at startup 
with out of memory is better than random segvs at some later point when the 
system is under load.  Refer to the principle of least surprise.  And if the 
user truely wants to disable that, well, you can give them a command line 
option to shoot themselves in the foot with.
