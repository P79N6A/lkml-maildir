Just a small FYI
I'm currently working on a patch to attempt to fix these up in 
binfmt_elf.c expect that to apear on the list within ~24hrs.
copy_to_user and clear_user can fail, and if they do appropriate action 
needs to be taken (probably returning a fault, a short read or similar) - 
not checking the return value and not taking any action is an error as I 
see it.
