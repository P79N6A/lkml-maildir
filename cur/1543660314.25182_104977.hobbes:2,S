Hi,
I was running  2.4.18 kernel, after very heavy networking traffic, my
machine was panic.

I looked at tcp_tw_death_row:
tcp_tw_death_row = $13 =
 {0xd4b4d380, 0x2, 0xf3089100, 0xd4728a80, 0xe0a51300, 0xd99c2580,
0xdab52a00, 0xeb568280}
You can see the second one "0x2" is not a structure of tcp_tw_bucket.
So my question is how this wrong info could possibly being added into
tcp_tw_death_row. or is this because this memory was not clean somewhere?
Thanks!
Hua
