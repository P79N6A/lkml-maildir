	I think I may have gotten confused here.  Are you only
talking about the NCR53*80* drivers (pas16, seagate, t128,
dmx3191, dtc), or the '80 and the '9x drivers (NCR53C9x.c,
blz1230, bzl2060, cyberstorm, cyberstormII, dec_esp, fastlane,
jazz_esp, mac_esp, mac_53c9x, oktago_esp, sun3x_esp), or both?
	NCR5380.c in 2.4.18 and 2.5.7-pre1 are identical files,
as is NCR5380.h.  If those are the only files that you were
talking about being reverted/upgraded, then my statements
about the diffs were in error, and I apologize for the confusion.
