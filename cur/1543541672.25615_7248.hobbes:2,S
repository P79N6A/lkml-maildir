	Wake me up when tar will reliably handle immutable and append-only,
will you? That's just for ext2 - coming up with UFS examples of suckitude
is _way_ simpler.
	Kai, care to reread the posting I was replying to? Part with the
horror expressed because of the need to use special tools if you want
_all_ _pieces_ _of_ _metadata_ on HFS. Now, could you please show me the
options that would make tar handle all pieces of metadata on ext2 or UFS?
No, it is not needed to deal with any reasonable setup. Except the full
fs backups.
