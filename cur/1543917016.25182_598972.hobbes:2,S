 Hello!
 Can i get this card working? Hotplug doesn't recognise it, however i
know that Linux supports it. My kernel is relatively new (2.6.11.1).
cartctl info gives this:
 --- cut ---
PRODID_1="            "
PRODID_2="NinjaSCSI Card_"
PRODID_3="Ver 1.00"
PRODID_4="NS00100M"
MANFID=0000,0000
FUNCID=255
 --- cut ---
 I wonder why the hell does it have empty numeric IDs?
