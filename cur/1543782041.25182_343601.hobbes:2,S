Then _please_ drop this thread.

James, please drop this thread and let's concentrate on SCSI.

No, the bug is _not_ in the API.  
*IDR is perfect as it is.*  It gives the caller a lot of freedom, without
internal restrictions (other than the provided by this patch).
Now please let's go back to SCSI and leave other people's code and API
alone.  Shall we James?
SCSI Core needs enough work to have SCSI people worry about other
people's code and design... or is this the modus operandi of the
SCSI Core maintainer...? "Documentation/ManagementStyle", please?
Thank you,
