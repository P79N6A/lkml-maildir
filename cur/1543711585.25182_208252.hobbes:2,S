A bunch of rather cosmetic comments while looking over the patch:
 - all the binfmt handler seems to copy exactly the same vma setup,
   maybe we should add a helper for that?
 - the struct anon_vma_s / anon_vma_t naming is awkward, why not just
   struct anon_vma *insert reference to Documentation/CodingStyle here*
 - the inclusion guards in objrmap.h are wrong
 - why is PG_swapcache bit 21?  You removed PG_direct so bit 16 is free now
 - I don't really like the swapper space special case in ___add_to_page_cache,
   IIRC there's only one caller of it for the swapper space and IMHO you're
   better off opencoding it
 - dito for __remove_from_page_cache 
 - is renaming rmap.c to objrmap.c really nessecary?  It contains about
   the same functions, and keeping the old, implementation-agnostic name
   makes it easiert to follow the radical changes..
