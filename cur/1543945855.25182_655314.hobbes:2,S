This fragment is much too short to allow to judge on possible reasons.
There is a high probability that your problem is caused by the cdrecord
fork called "wodim".
Please always include the following information in your bug-report: 
- The version number of cdrecord that caused the bug. 
- The command line that was used for the failing command. 
- The complete output (including error messages) from 'cdrecord -v ...' 
- Probably the important part of the 'cdrecord -V' output if we agreed on it 
- The OS name, release and hardware (processor) 
- Special conditions of your environment (libc vers. SCSI transport ...) 
- Sufficient information on the media used. This is at least the ATIP data, a 
  note to CD-R/CD-RW and information on the state and the case history of this
  media. 
As a general advise: if you have problems, always first try recent original 
software from
ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/cdrecord/alpha/
None of the 30+ bugs reported against wodim in various Linux distributions is 
known to be present with recent original software.
