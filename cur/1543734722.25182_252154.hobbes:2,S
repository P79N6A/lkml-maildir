you probably want to ensure that the order of netfilter events are:
   1. [packet comes in]
   2. netfilter INPUT
   3. [GRE decap]
   4. [addressed to us?]
       Yes => netfilter INPUT
       No => netfilter FORWARD
i don't think that both (2) and (4) are done.
also just a minor nit: not all WCCP needs to be GRE-encoded; on 
high-performance switch/router platforms, only a layer-2 rewrite of the dst 
MAC addr is used instead of a layer-3 GRE tunnel.  you may want the comment 
at line 609 to explicitly mention "WCCPv1 and WCCPv2 GRE Forwarding mode".
cheers,
lincoln.
