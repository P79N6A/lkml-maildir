Hello!
Is it possible to slow down the spinning speed of this drive? When it
plays audio CD it slow and quiet, when I insert a data CD it is like a
vacum cleaner, and the noise degrades the MP3's listening experience.
I have tried the CDROM_SELECT_SPEED ioctl() with various speed
settings, but it did not seem to make any difference.
Kernel: 2.2.13
Thanks,
Miklos
