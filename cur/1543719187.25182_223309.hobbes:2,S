Very good question indeed, why is it there for the i386 architecture at
all?
I just don't like the idea of unnecessary branching for the AMD64
architecture increasing maintenance and testing affords and thereby
generating less maintained and tested code.

Seems to work, just like the i386 irqbalanced before it has been
obsoleted by CONFIG_IRQBALANCE
