Thanks for the confirmation of the error condition.  As best I can
recall, your boot log is substantially the same as what I saw.
Finally got back in town.  Starting the git-bisect process.  I've got
a relatively slow network connection, and the PWS 433au isn't exactly
what I would call "fast" by modern standards, so bear with me while I
get things set up and crank through this.  The clone of the 2.6 tree
will take several more hours to finish downloading.  I anticipate the
best pace I'll be able to manage after that is two iterations in a 24-
hour period.
