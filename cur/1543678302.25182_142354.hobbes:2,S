Ouch, this hurts. The lawyer in me just told me that this is no proper 
way to argue. And he means both sides. I think he's right.
Davide, calm down and take a deep breath. Better? :) Alan probably 
receives thousands of mails every day and he therefore tends to make it 
somewhat very short sometimes. Be happy that he even aswered at all, right?
You got a point, though. The only issue Alan mentioned was the NULL 
initialisation.
Let's give Alan another chance to explain (shortly) why he thought your 
patch was ugly - would you, Alan?
Point is, this is a serious issue. IRQ routing is nothing that should be
decided over beauty. Alan, you obviously saw the code. Are you perhaps 
willing to make a better patch if you're that unsatisfied with the 
current one?
Thomas
