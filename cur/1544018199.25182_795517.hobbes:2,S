I appreciated your help when I first posted this driver, and you 
are a general driver guy, so I copied you, but I didn't expect you 
to take over shepherding patches into the tree for me.  I don't really 
know how this process works, but I'm happy to copy any person/list that 
will help me move code into the tree.  
I got an email that this patch was in -mm, but I don't know where it 
went from there.
I have a simple add device id patch that I was going to submit after 
figuring out the patch submission process.
