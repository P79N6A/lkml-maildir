Yes, in theory, sharing shared percpu data with local percpu data in one
cache line can cause cache line contention between remote and local
access.
And this undesirable sharing does happen in current git.
On x86, without the patch, runqueue shares cacheline with cpu_domains.
c0633e80 d per_cpu__runqueues
c06347e0 d per_cpu__cpu_domains
Other architectures also have this undesired sharing. IA64 is an
example.
In future, this undesired sharing could happen with other data if we do 
not have a methodology to prevent it.
I just do not have data to show the performance hit for this sharing
now.
Thanks.
