That warning is totally bogus. It shouldn't be printed out at all when 
"newirq" is 0 (as in this case). 
Even for a non-zero newirq, I suspect that 99% of the time, 
"pci=usepirqmask" would end up causing more problems than it could ever 
solve.
But this diff would seem to be the minimal fix.
The other problems _look_ like they are -mm related, not in plain 2.6.15. 
Etienne, can you confirm?
