Hi,
I have released YET another version of the perfmon2 new code base.
This one is STILL relative to 2.6.15-rc6 and is called 2.6.15-rc6-v2.
This one DOES fix the panic on pfm_fmt_put()!
This patch includes compared to initial 2.6.15-rc6:
    - quick overview of perfmon2 README
    - fix the kernel panic on pfm_fmt_put()
    - save/restore of PMU state when NMI watchdog is
      enabled.
    - reinforced  checks in register_smpl_fmt()
    - revised checks to detect if a format/PMU description is
      builtin or module
    - sampling formats can now export the notification
      message queue depth they require.
    - MIPS patch updated to latest fixes.
You MUST use libpfm-3.2-051215 with this kernel due to
interface change for pfm_create_context().
As usual, you can download the latest packages from the
SourceForge website at:
http://www.sf.net/projects/perfmon2
This will hopefully be the last release for this year.
Happy Holidays.
