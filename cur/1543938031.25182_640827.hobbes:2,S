They work significantly differently in a few important areas (e.g. particularly 
regarding NX  handling and the kernel mapping) Off the top of my 
head I don't know of a clean way to unify them. 32bit and 64bit kernel 
mappings differ in many significant ways. Maybe it's possible, but it's 
certainly not something I would want to tackle short term in a hurry.
The kernel mappings between 32bit and 64bit are quite different.
However I would like GBPAGES definitely to make the .25 merge window
and they won't work without the upgraded c_p_a().
So please reconsider.

I'm sure a hurried up unification would make it even more fragile.
