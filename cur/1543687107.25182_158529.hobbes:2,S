Hi,
I am trying to benchmark a iSCSI driver for performance on a 2.4 kernel. I
have used dd, dt, IOmeter and rawio utilities so far and each seemed to
represent a different picture to me on the same setup (Single target with
few LUNS).  (DD showed good performance on an ext2 mounted file system till
I realized that I was writing to the buffer and not writing on the raw
drive). Since I am trying to catch up with the SCSI world, I am just
wondering if any one else has tried any other utilities that would provide
better results or am I doing something wrong here??
-Thanks in advance,
-Regards
Samdeep
