Jeff is probably right - /proc/interrupts is similar on both the failing 
(test4) and working (test3) except for the eth0 entry (the via rhine 
chipset on the motherboard) assigned to IRQ11 in test3 and IRQ5 in test4.
Differences in the boot.msg between test3 and test4 start with an entry 
"PM Adding info for No Bus: legacy" in the working one which is not 
found in the failing (test4) boot.msg.   There are differences in the 
"ACPI Subsystem revision" number that is logged.  Various ACPI related 
messages are found in the failing boot.msg before "ACPI interpreter 
enabled"    In the good one (test3) following the PCI: Probing PCI 
hardware line are a series of "PM: Adding info for ..". messages which 
look like they are finding  various PCI devices (these are not found in 
the failing test4 case).
I am experimenting with disabling ACPI on test4 to see if that bypasses 
the problem.
