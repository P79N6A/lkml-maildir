Well there are two ways I'd do this
#1: Throw the whole thing away and accept its not a good idea anyway
#2: If I was really going this way and I wanted to use it for serious
tricks for high performance I/O then I'd provide the handle from
userspace so that the strategy for allocation is controlled by the caller
who is the only one who can make the smart decisions
