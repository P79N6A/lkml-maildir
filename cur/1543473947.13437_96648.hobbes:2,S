I had actually sent this off to Alan around the 2.1.131-ac8 time frame,
but I think it got overlooked.  This updates the aic7xxx driver from
5.1.6 to 5.1.7.  The changes here add support for a new card (a new
device ID is needed and that's pretty much it), fix a bug where when
there was a SELECTION_TIMEOUT and the command was not the original
command, but instead was an error recovery re-queued command, then we
did the wrong thing (mistaken test against p->flags instead of
scb->flags), updates a few comments, and makes one change to the
SXFRCTL1 register setting to speed up bus scans.  That's it.  There is a
5.1.8 driver on the way to fix some other things, but this will catch
the 2.2.0-pre kernels up to where I'm at aside from the incomplete work.
