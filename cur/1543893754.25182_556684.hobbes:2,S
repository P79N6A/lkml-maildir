The reason we do it today is to save memory in a memory constrained environment.
So with such a suggestion you should back it up with numbers.
How much RAM is wasted by keeping the __init and _exit sections
in memory for a normal embedded build?
You could try a random defconfig for arm or mips since they are
embedded in general. Using defconfig for i386 could tell us
a little but not that important.
And when evaluating the numbers think of maybe 8 MB RAM in total, no swap
storage, and sloow filesystem for permanent storage.
