Hi all,
I'm trying to get my SIL3112 RAID controller to work.  It's in an ASUS
A7N8X mobo.  I'd like to boot from a RAID 1 array.
I've built silraid into the kernel (2.4.22), but on boot I get:
driver for Silicon Image Medley 0.0.1: no raid array found.
My two drives are detected as /dev/hda and /dev/hdc.  I _have_ set up
the array in the SIL BIOS.
If anyone can guide me on this, I'd be very grateful.  As I would be for
a CC, as I'm not subscribed.
