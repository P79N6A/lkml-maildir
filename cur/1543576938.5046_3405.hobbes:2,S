Hello,
I don't know who maintains the loopback device these days, but if
someone feels responsible, and would accept feature requests, I would
really like to see a "limit" option in addition to "offset".  This
would greatly simplify accessing partitioned disk images.
I could go ahead and try to do it, but if someone already knows the
code, I thought I'd throw it out there.
