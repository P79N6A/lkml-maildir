Bjorn,
Your comments on OS design are of course interesting, but perhaps before
studying OS internals it is also worth to study network etiquette a bit -
namely, if I wished my words to appear on linux-kernel mailing list I
would have cc'd:linux-kernel myself.
As for "misconception of things being faster when in kernel mode", I am
well aware of the trivial scenario you are describing but was rather
mentioning it because of no need to switch between user<->kernel as
opposed to running the loop itself in the kernel (otherwise almost the
same can be achieved by running RT userspace code). This is why things
like sys_copyfile() or sys_movedirectorytree_atomically() would be a good
idea, i.e. doing things in atomic manner and without too many mode
switches. In the same manner (assuming gzip is de-facto standard of
compression, which it is) it would be nice to say sys_gzip("file",
"file.gz") and end up with the result atomically, rather than observing a
slowly increasing file.gz and then suddenly disappearing file.
Your definition of OS is valid but you seem to give a very narrow
(though widely-accepted) meaning to the "application" as "userspace
program". One can treat khttpd as a "kernelspace application", perhaps a
revolutionary and a unique (until all other vendors start shipping
their own inkernel web servers - just a guess) notion but so what?
As Lenin said "revolution is the merge of the city with a countryside" (or
something along those lines) so one can make a revolutionary OS by merging
applications+kernel ;)
