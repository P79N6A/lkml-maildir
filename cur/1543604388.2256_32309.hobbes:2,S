Any license not listed in include/linux/module.h is not GPL compatible.
That list is currently (2.4.11)
"GPL"                           [GNU Public License v2 or later]
"GPL and additional rights"     [GNU Public License v2 rights and more]
"Dual BSD/GPL"                  [GNU Public License v2 or BSD license choice]
"Dual MPL/GPL"                  [GNU Public License v2 or Mozilla license choice]

incompatible.
