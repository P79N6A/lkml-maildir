Inconsistent with other bit operations.

Then there will no barrier since clear_bit only has acquire semantics. This is a 
bug in bit operations since smb_mb__before_clear_bit does not work as 
documentted.

Ok.

Well ultimately I wish we could move away from these 
smb_mb__before/after_xx macros and use explicit synchronization ordering 
instead.
If there is agreement on this patch then we can use explicit ordering in 
core kernel code and slowly get rid of smb_mb__xxx.
