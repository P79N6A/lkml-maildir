You are right!
I was looking for "lost need_resched flag" scenarios.  In the above
cases, need_resched is "lost", but does no harm because the flag is set
in order for the CURRENT process to yield the CPU.  This is in contrast
with the case when the flag is set to schedule some newly available
processes.
