It would seem that some people's goal is to restrict the movement of Free
Software to the lowest common denominator of all legislation anywhere in the
world. That means banning crypto, banning stuff which is patented in the US
but explicitly not permitted to be patented under EU rules, etc. 
Follow it through and you'll end up banning code containing swearwords, too
- although nobody from such a country has yet been shortsighted or arrogant
enough, like the American contingent usually is, to think that their own
legislation should affect the rest of the world and demand that we do so.
I don't want that, thank you very much. If it makes technical sense for
crypto and other code to be integrated with the kernel, then we should do
so, and let those who live under insane restrictions do something about it
themselves - either by overthrowing their government, or more likely by
downloading the code, stripping out the parts which their particular
legislation doesn't like, and putting that version up for FTP within their
country.
