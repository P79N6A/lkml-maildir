Hi Greg,
I spent some time fixing up the driver tree on s390 and found that the
easiest way to do so is to introduce default attribute groups for
device drivers (like for devices).
Since I'm lazy, I didn't take care to delay the uevent for device
drivers to after adding the attribute groups, but this should be done
when struct device_driver is converted to the new kobject interface.
