What can I say, I'm bad with names?
This is why I'm so careful to write them down accurately in my notebook, 
which is at home.  (I have some stuff typed into a text file on my laptop, 
but it's easier to drag out a notebook and jot something down then to wait 30 
seconds for my dell monstrosity's bios to boot up, open a window, cd to the 
approprite directory, edit a text file, then shut everything down again.
I should probably get a palm pilot one of these days...
