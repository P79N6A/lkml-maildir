So, do you want me to create more of these?
If you want them, could you perhaps start by ACK'ing the first 5
patches to help me get them merged?
Once I see the first 5 merged I'll start creating more, but I don't
want to waste time doing so before that.

I started writing such a script myself yesterday, but it's not done
yet. If you already have one that works could I have a copy please?
That would make my life easier if I'm to help you with this.
