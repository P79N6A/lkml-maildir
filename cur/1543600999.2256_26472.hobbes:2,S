With 2.4.9-ac9 'shutdown -r' does not work.  The
halt '-h' flag does work.  '-r' hangs at "Restarting System."
I set my machine bios to acpi=no, and also acpi=yes the same 
hang occurred both times.
Here is the APM config:
CONFIG_PM=y
# CONFIG_ACPI is not set
CONFIG_APM=y
# CONFIG_APM_IGNORE_USER_SUSPEND is not set
# CONFIG_APM_DO_ENABLE is not set
# CONFIG_APM_CPU_IDLE is not set
# CONFIG_APM_DISPLAY_BLANK is not set
# CONFIG_APM_RTC_IS_GMT is not set
# CONFIG_APM_ALLOW_INTS is not set
CONFIG_APM_REAL_MODE_POWER_OFF=y
Here is the pertinent dmesg stuff:
