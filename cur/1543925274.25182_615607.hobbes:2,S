Hi Mel,
 Thanks for reviewing.

__meminit here is to avoid section link warning here.
this function is called by vmemmap_alloc_block which is a __meminit function,
so if I mark it as __meminit, there were be warning about section mismatch, 
although this function will not be called during memory hotplug time.

Yes, the 4UL*1024*1024*1024 could be a define here.
However I think define constant for a boolean parameter is overkilling. Look at kernel code, 
e.g.
the force parameter in get_user_pages
and 
the sync parameter in try_to_wake_up 
we don't do things like
#define TRY_TO_WAKEUP_SYNC 1
#define TRY_TO_WAKEUP_NOSYNC 0 
There are other examples in kernel code. I believe it is a common practice not to define constant for a Boolean parameter.
How do you think?

I was told by Andrew that ARCH_HAS_XXX is not preferred half a year before in
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/5/17/287
So I reworked that patch to the preferred __attribute__ ((weak)))
