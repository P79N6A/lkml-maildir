Hi all ,
	I had posted a message previously also and got some usefule info about the 
same topic . I have a ads graphic client plus board (Strong ARM SA1100 ) 
running 2.4.7 kernel. The problem is that a small c++ application which 
causes the system to reboot. What i guessed is that at some point of time 
some memory corruption is happening and it's causing the code to jump to the 
RSRR ( reset registers ) and reboot the system. I went to the 
/include/asm/arch/SA-1100.h file and changed the definition of the RSRR 
register from 0x90030000 to 0xE0030000. Now if i run the application for the 
first time, the board does not reboot   but 2 or  3 executions cause the 
board to reboot. 
      What i want to do is , to somehow find out at what point of time kernel 
is loosing control and  writing to RSRR register.  
       And is there any other way to reboot , other then writing to RSRR 
register.
      If someone has some clue, it will be helpfull   .
regards,
rpm
