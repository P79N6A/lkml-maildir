The machine is actually slower.  That's how I noticed the problem.
Underclocking dosen't seem likely due to the difference in speed.  It's 4
bogomips instead of 500.  The machine is running at about the speed of a
386 (I believe that's about right).  It almost seems as if someone turned
off the turbo button.  But of course I haven't seen one of those since my
old 486 :)
