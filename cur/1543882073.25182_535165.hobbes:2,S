I'm sorry that you feel that way, Pavel.
I can agree that I implement features that people ask for, but I think
saying "every feature someone asks for" is going a bit far (I won't ask
you to prove that). My desire is to provide Linux with hibernation
support that does more than just the bare minimum. Different people have
different usage scenarios, and this has led to me implementing more and
different features.
As to wanting to merge them all, this is true. No one wants to put time
into something only to have it left out. But I don't see why you think
this is a bad thing. Many kernel guys claim the thing follows an
evolutionary model. Well, here's software that has been developed out of
tree - evolved if you like - and which many people would consider more
mature ('evolved'?) than [u]swsusp. If evolutionary theory is to be
followed, let the fittest survive!
