I assume you're talking about test_and_{set,clear}_bit here.  Their return
value isn't consistent with the other _trylock functions since they're not
_trylock functions.
I think the real problem is that people use test_and_set_bit for locks,
which is almost never[1] a good idea.  The overhead for a semaphore shouldn't
be too much in most cases, and that way it is obvious what you want to do -
and, hopefully, even more obvious if you end up with a semaphore that can
be turned into a spinlock without further changes.

_trylock functions return 0 for success.
