Funny you mention this point!
I just spent 30-45 minutes on the phone talking to Jens about this very
issue.  Jens states he can map the model in to 2.5. and will give it a
fling in a bit.  This issue is a must; however, I had given up on the idea
until 2.7.  However, the issues he and I addressed, in combination to your
request jive in sync.
Cheers,
