Well ... not so sure of this as I once was ... so be gentle with me ;-)
But if the system has been running for a while, memory is full of pagecache,
etc. We try to allocate from the local node, fail, and fall back to the
other nodes, which are all full as well. Then we wake up kswapd, but all
pages in this node are dirty, so we block for ages on writeout, making 
mem allocate really latent and slow (which was presumably what
balance_dirty_pages was there to solve in the first place).

True. But that seems a bit extreme for a system with 64GB of RAM, and only
896Mb in ZONE_NORMAL ;-) Doesn't really seem like the right way to fix it.
