Hi,
I really don't know who could help me. I was looking up and down in all the
mail archives I know.
I have an old NCR 3400 system with 486 DX processor in it with those
harware:
 scsi controller ncr 53c700
 vga on board ncr 77c22e
 hard discs seagate st4767n and st32430n
and I have following problem:
I can not boot Linux on it from floppy (or ofcourse anything else). The
booting process stops with the last message:
Console: colour VGA+ 80x25
I have tryied RedHat 6.0. distribution kernel 2.2.5-15
thanks a lot for your help
Dan Vesely
