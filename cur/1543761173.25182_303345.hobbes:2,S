I suppose you have to have your priorities.  It may be old to you, but 
it's current to me!  That used to be the hallmark of Linux, the fact 
that it would run on lesser hardware.
Of course, I don't know how well video capture is going to work without 
the apic programming.  So I guess I'm reduced to rebooting when I want 
to switch between USB peripherals and video capture?
Maybe I should have lied and said it worked :-)
