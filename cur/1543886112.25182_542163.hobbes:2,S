The sync ->probe() could return after step 1 (when it is clear the
driver wants to bind to the device). The remainder should be done in
the async function, so that the bus could go on with other devices. The
driver should then signal when it is done with its registrations.

If you're talking about devices registered by the driver, these should
be in the async section.

I don't really see the difference?

Hm, maybe I'm dense, but I really don't understand the problem here.
Why should (optional) sync followed by (optional) async followed by bus
synchonization not cover all cases? The async portion can also do some
"sync" stuff and then signal completion, can't it?
If you're worried about notifications to userspace, you could first
suppress the add uevent via uevent_suppress and then generate it when
you signal completion to the bus.
