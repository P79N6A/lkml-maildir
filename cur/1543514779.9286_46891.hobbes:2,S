Hi, Everyone!
I upgrade kernel 2.3.24 to 2.3.25 using patch ,  but while booting, the
kernel loged the following messages( in file /var/log/message):
Nov  2 09:54:53 1 kernel: vga16fb: unable to reserve VGA memory, exiting
Nov  2 09:54:53 1 kernel: init.c:110: bad pmd 00000000040001e3.
Nov  2 09:54:53 1 kernel: kernel BUG at vmalloc.c:219!
Nov  2 09:54:53 1 kernel: invalid operand: 0000
Nov  2 01:54:45 1 swapon: swapon: warning: /dev/hda7 has insecure
permissions 0660, 0600 suggested
Nov  2 01:54:45 1 rc.sysinit: Activating swap partitions failed
Nov  2 09:54:52 1 ifup: SIOCADDRT: File exists
I know that maybe some errors are not kernel related, but some are.
Thanks for any help !
