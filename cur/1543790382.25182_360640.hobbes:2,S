I'm trying to wrap inotify functionality for python.  I ran into a problem. 
In order to use python's select on the fd, I need to use python's
os.fdopen.  It seems os.fdopen calls:
fcntl(4, F_GETFL)                       = -1 EBADF (Bad file descriptor)
Looks like inotify doesn't support calling fcntl.  Should it?
