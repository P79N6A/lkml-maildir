Hello,
Release 1.0.0 of Libsysfs is now available as part of the sysfsutils 
package at:
	
http://linux-diag.sourceforge.net
Libsysfs provides APIs to access the sysfs filesystem for device 
information. 
Major changes in this release include:
	* A comprehensive testsuite to exercise APIs exported by
		Libsysfs. An easy to use config file is provided
		so users can modify appropriately for the system
		under test.
	* Improvements to "refresh" functions (udev requirement).
	* dlist elements now stored in sorted order.
	* A reworked systool for better output.
	* A number of miscellaneous bugfixes.
udev has been shipping with more or less the latest code for quite
a few releases now. 
Thanks to everyone who have been using the library and providing
valuable feedback.
Comments, suggestions, patches welcome!
Thanks,
Ananth
