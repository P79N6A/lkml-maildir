I think this "bug" appears with some binutils some weeks/months old. Try
to upgrade them.
I'm not hitting this bug, but for me, ./arch/alpha/kernel/head.o isn't
build (actually, there aren't any .o files in that directory), even if
I try to explicitely compile head.o by 'make arch/alpha/kernel/head.o'.
Any hints there?
