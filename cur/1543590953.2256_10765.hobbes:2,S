I think you are assuming that I need multiple majors so that
potentially all 256 possibly md devices can each be partitioned.  Is
that right?
I wasn't going to be that generous.  If you want to partition md
devices, you can only partition the first 16, into upto 15 partitions each.
If you have need for more arrays or more partitions than that, then
your problem is less like a peanut, and LVM begins to look less like a
sledgehammer.
