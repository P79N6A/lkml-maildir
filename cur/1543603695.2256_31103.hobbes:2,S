   for my sun ultrasparc 10 with linux i wanted to upgrade to a gigabit card
   but when looking in the menuconfig i only see : (kernel 2.2.20pre10)
   MyriCOM Gigabit Ethernet support
   does anyone know which cards are supported ? (with patches?)
   it has to be 1000base-T
No patches needed, 2.2.x (and 2.4.x) supports Syskonnect gigabit cards
out of the box.
Acenic is supported in 2.4.x, although I don't know why not in 2.2.x
as that should be trivial to make work...
Franks a lot,
