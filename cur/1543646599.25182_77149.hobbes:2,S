I was thinking more of just sharing the code.  There are more trees out
there than just Linus'.  Deciding to apply one of your patches is much
easier if we have the specific patch, rather than just a 600k patch from
Linus that happens to include your patch buried inside it.

I'm not bitching about bk here.  It's clearly improved Linus'
productivity.  I don't use it, but I like Linus using it.  And with
the udiff-ing of each changeset, I can see each patch he applied, even
if it wasn't sent to lkml.  That wasn't possible before bk.  It's the
next best thing to actually having the author of the patch think others
may want the same patch Linus wants.
