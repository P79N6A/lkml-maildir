   I was thinking of that bit of code in ip_gre.c which I sent the fix for
   recently. Unless I've missed something it calls update_pmtu on the dst
   which is passed by the encapsulated protocol, although I've not actually
   tested that.
   
   Thats the reason I wasn't sure about the fix which I sent... it deleted the
   duplicated call only for IPv4 rather than the one which appears to get called
   for every protocol as I wasn't sure what was intended.
   
No, this must be an IPV4 or an IPV6 route.
Right Alexey?
