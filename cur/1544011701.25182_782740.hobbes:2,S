Guess what I have done. ;-)
I'm already running CPUFreq using the "ondemand" governor. "Powersave",
by the way, is not the best method to actually save power, but I sure
believe you know this too well. :)

Thanks for this rant, I have totally forgotten about powertop, shame on me!
Out of this scope, though, another question: why was the
CONFIG_DEBUG_KERNEL option "hardlinked" to CONFIG_FRAME_POINTER? (Well,
rather vice versa.) I don't really see the point in making the Kernel
larger and, even more imporant, slower when enabling CONFIG_TIMER_STATS
or CONFIG_SCHEDSTATS... I guess you'll get it.
A few month ago this was different and, to my mind, also more logical.
That is, one could disable CONFIG_FRAME_POINTER when not needed and
still use most of the nifty statistic/"pseudo-debugging" features. For
"real" debugging, of course, the frame pointers must be turned on. I
guess that's a question of definition...?

I already did play with this thought as well... Let's see where I can
borrow a quite good device for some time. :)
Thank you for your great and fast answers.
