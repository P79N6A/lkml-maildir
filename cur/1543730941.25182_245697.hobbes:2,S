It has always bugged me that Gnome and KDE implement their own VFS layers.
It seems to me that having a standard userspace filesystem layer like 
FUSE (
http://sourceforge.net/projects/avf
) would provide a lot of the 
benefit that HURD users (all 5 of them) see from filesystem 
"translators". Now, safely allowing unprivileged users to run arbitrary 
userspace filesystems would be a real trick. But, if it were possible, 
it could be combined with files-as-directories in some rather neat ways.
