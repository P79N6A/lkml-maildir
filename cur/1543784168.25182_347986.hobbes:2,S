The first thing that would worry me about such an architecture would be
deadlocks between user space and kernel PCI accesses trapped under
simulation.
If you take a look at Xen or qemu both would give you a way to run the
virtualised simulated device in Linux user space on a sane complete
Linux environment while running a seperate copy of Linux experiencing
the simulated device.
Xen is fast - very fast, qemu is somewhat slower but because it is a JIT
can do accurate tracing and has a lovely well designed API for adding
virtualised drivers, plus nice examples like video cards and a virtual
NE2000.
