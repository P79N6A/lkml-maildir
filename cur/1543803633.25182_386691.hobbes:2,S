You are right. But it breaks compatibility with iwconfig unless we
emulate 'iwconfig mode' command by deleting and adding interface. This
means some events are generated, hotplug/udev gets involved etc.  In the
worst case it can mean that we end up with interface with a different
name.

I'm not sure about your concept of softmac modules. I wrote an e-mail
some time ago explaining why I don't think it is useful and I haven't
got any reply. Please, could you answer that e-mail first? (See
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-netdev&m=113404158202233&w=2)
Could you also explain how would you implement separate module for AP
mode? How would you bind that module to the rest of ieee80211,
especially in the rx path?
Thanks,
