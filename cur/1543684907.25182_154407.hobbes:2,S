Subject: [PATCH][TRIVIAL][2.6] Bugzilla bug # 993 - Documentation/Changes still reads 2.5
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

One additional change of kernel version numbers (2.5 -> 2.6.) As I said already, this should
be "fixed" now, so that we don't have to think about trivial patches like this one later.
