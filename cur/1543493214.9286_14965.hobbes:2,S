Have another one; from /proc/sys/inode-state:
13890   3099    0       0       0       0       0
FWIW the number of used inodes is normally around two to three
thousand. It's nothing like the leak in 2.2.1, but it's still a leak,
probably.
(Anyone else seeing inode leaks, or is this just me seeing things?)
