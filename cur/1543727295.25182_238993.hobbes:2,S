My current plan is for the radeon driver to keep the code for enabling
the ROM. Otherwise we have to build all of the radeon PCI IDs somewhere
else into the kernel. In my system if you dump if without the driver
loaded it is FFFF, load the driver and you see it. First thing the
driver does is fix the ROM so that it is visible to the hotplug event.

But isn't this architecture specific? The Mac doesn't shadow ROMs at
0xC0000 does it? How does it shadow ROMs?
I may change the API a little today and expose a map/unmap ROM function
to make things easier for the driver to get the right copy. Adding
those calls will let me add a pci_map_rom_copy, which the driver can
use to trigger the copy for ROMs that aren't fully decoded.
