I tested a handful of kernel versions, and it looks like this is
indeed the case. As far as I can tell, this problem was introduced
between 2.6.19.7 and 2.6.20.
Looking at the diff between those versions, it looks like there were
some noteworthy changes to the SMP balancer. I'm still working on
narrowing this down further.
Thanks,
