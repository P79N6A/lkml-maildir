Sorry about that Patrick. I had sent some mail last might and thought it
went to the list.
Both James and I can reproduce this problem. I was able to reproduce
using a hack to scsi_debug. 
The loop problem is related to scsi error handling using the common code
of scsi_queue_insert / scsi_requesT_fn . When a command gets started the
scsi_init_cmd_errh function is called which sets retries to 0.
There maybe another issue with the scsi_eh_get_sense function, but I am
still looking at it.
I believe James is still pursuing a solution also.
