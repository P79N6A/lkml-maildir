Dumb question:
I've been following the freebsd-hackers list for a while, and in
that domain, the Intel NICs are the preferred interfaces because
they perform well and are very stable.
One approach to the endless eepro100 headaches would be to port
the FreeBSD if_fxp driver to Linux.  After all, drivers have been
ported between these OSs before; e.g., the aic7xxx SCSI adapter.
However, I see no evidence that this has been attempted.  Can
someone tell me what I'm obviously missing?
