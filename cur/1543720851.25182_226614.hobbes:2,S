Subject: touchpad (PS/2) mouse detection problem.

Hello,
I've compiled the 2.6.6 kernel, and I can't seem to get my laptops 
touchpad to get detected.
The touchpad runs on the ps/2 protocol; so it seems like there would be 
no problems with
detection. But of course I'm not a very lucky person ;-). The touchpad 
itself does have an
on/off botton; and I've made sure to keep it ON. This is a strange 
problem because I don't
seem to have it in older kernels (2.4.x). Cat'ing 
/proc/bus/input/devices also doesn't turn up
any useful information; just returns my keyboard (which works; yepi!). 
I've compiled
psmouse both into the kernel and as a module; both don't work.
dmesg only shows "mice: PS/2 mouse device common for all mice" but no 
'input:' line.
Regards,
Vadim Garber
