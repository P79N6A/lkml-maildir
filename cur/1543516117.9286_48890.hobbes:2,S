Hi,
I've been able to get 2.3.28 with Ingo's zoned-2.3.28-H2 patch going on ARM,
but unfortunately I keep on getting Oopses in do_fork, specifically in
copy_fs.
The oops is within the following code:
        tsk->fs->root = dget(current->fs->root);
where the dentries count is incremented.  The address seems to be the ASCII
string 'linu'.
Dumping out the contents of current->fs shows that it is valid before the
kmalloc() but not after it.  In fact, turning on poisoning in mm/slab.c
changes the Oops address to 0x5a5a5a5a, the poison value.
Has anyone else used Ingo's patch, and have they seen similar results?
I have no idea whether this happens on the stock 2.3.28 kernel - it is
not possible to get this to boot on ARM without serious hacking.
