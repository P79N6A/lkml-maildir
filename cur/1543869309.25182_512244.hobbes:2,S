you read "Hello World!" and you write "Hello World!" to the console
> read(0, "\376\377\377f\377\330\0000", 8192) = 8
> write(1, "\376\377\377f\377\330\0000", 8│║ f0) = 8
and here you read garbage from the input, so you write garbage out,
which probably confuses the heck out of your terminal for not being
correct UTF-8
