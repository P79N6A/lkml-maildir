Subject: What is needed to boot 2.6 on opteron dual core

Hello lkml,
I am trying to boot a dual core Opteron box with linux 2.6 and it is
crashing very early (swapper process dies, backtrace shows SMP_boot....
Stuff) and I was wondering what patches are needed to boot a 2.6 kernel
on a dual core machine.
I tried 2.6.11.9, 2.6.12-rc4 and 2.6.11-ac7 with the same error. It is
difficult for me to copy the output since this is a workstation and not
a server but I can give details if my question does not make sense. 
Thanks in advance.
The machine works fine with redhat 3 update 5 I think but it is 2.4
based.
