Hi again.
The attached patch is against ac6 and hopefully fixes the problems
reported (I personally inspected it to make sure that the rcpci45_pci_table
stuff was correct). An updated patch against 240p2 can be found at
www.jaquet.dk/kernel/patches/rcpci.patch.gz
<pause>
On closer look this patch (against ac6) might be a bit to large to 
post to linux-kernel. I will make it available at 
www.jaquet.dk/kernel/patches/rcpci.patch.ac6.gz instead.
