I have the same problem with keyboard, if i am using smp kernel (P4
3.0-HT). Now i am using uniprocessor kernel 2.6.18 and the problem is
solved. The problem was already in kernel 2.6.16,2.6.17,... more than 5
different versions. Few months ago i was trying to trace the source of
problem but without any success.
