   Why do we suddenly agree about this part? A misunderstading?

   Like, because it never got a chance to use it after allocating it?

   Race condition. Linux is a multitasking system. Think of two or more
processes.

    Where "much later" can be anything from a timeslice and up. Even if you
memset() straight away, too bad Linux decided to give the CPU(s) to other
processes. Linux is a multitasking system.
