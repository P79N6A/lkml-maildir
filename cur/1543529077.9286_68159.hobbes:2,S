Thats not correct. When disk I/O is being queued other userspace tasks run
whenever the I/O blocks. So mysql will generate a lot of I/O and spend most
of its time asleep where other stuff can run. Of course all the other stuff
probably wants the disk too. 
At that point with heavy I/O the SMP scaling issues you mention kick in on
2.2 as does the elevator algorithm flaw where we are starving some processes
excessively under high I/O load.
