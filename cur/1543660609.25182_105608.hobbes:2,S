Just to add... I think that the proposed pci_using_msi() could certainly 
store additional information in struct pci_dev, if it needed to... 
whether it is stored in arch-specific sysdata or in generic struct 
pci-dev, I leave as a question to the implementor ;-)
If "what is there is the irq field", then add the additional information 
you want :)
