There is a minor display order bug in 2.4.0 when using make menuconfig, 
under "SCSI":
--- Some SCSI devices (e.g. CD jukebox) support multiple LUNs           
[ ]   Enable extra checks in new queueing code                          
[ ]   Probe all LUNs on each SCSI device                                
I believe the "---" line should be after the "Enable extra checks" 
line, right? Could confuse people.
