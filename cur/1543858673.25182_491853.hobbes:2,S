Just my 0.02€ - one of the things I wonder about is why eg. class*
interfaces has been replaced with something "protected" by GPL enforcing
macros. What is the point? Nobody wins. The access to the new fine-grained
system has been restricted for users, and distributors (yes, I maintain
a such module) have to work around this in-kernel restriction
and create cludges.
Greg (and others from the "every touch of my bits is a derivation of it
and I need to protect it" party)  - what are you thinking? Do you
seriously think that such restrictions would help anyone? IMO protecting
the access to interfaces is an utterly stupid idea in the free software
world.
Eduard.
