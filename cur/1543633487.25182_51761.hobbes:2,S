I don't know what is "typical" for non-x86, but for x86, why not
use something more like a 'typical' NR_CPUS for SMP, like 8 (?)...
why still waste all of that memory?
| CONFIG_NR_CPUS=64: alpha, ia64, mips64, ppc64, s390, s390x, sparc64, x86-64

What was this problem?  I missed it but would like to see it.
(or do you know what the Subject: was?)
