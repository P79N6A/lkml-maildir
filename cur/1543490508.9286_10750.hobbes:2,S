I've just compiled and installed 2.0.37-pre8 and booted with;
 GNU ld version 2.8.1 (with BFD linux-2.8.1.0.1)
slackware 3.4
Everything seems to run as normal, except that i've noticed that "free"
shows a more conservative memory status.

Realy all i'm interested in is ax25 netrom mkiss etc, and that all seems to
work like a charm.
Do i really need to upgrade my Binutils. ??
Alan (and co-workers), your work is highly appricated, thanks.
Where do i have to send the crate of beer.?
