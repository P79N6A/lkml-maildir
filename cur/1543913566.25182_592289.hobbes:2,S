Sorry, it looks from the AMD document like nontemporal stores to wb
memory can go out of order. It is a bit hard to decipher what the types
mean.
If this is the case, we can either retain the sfence in smp_wmb(), or noop
it, and put explicit sfences around any place that performs nontemporal
stores...
Anyway, the lfence should be able to go away without so much trouble.
