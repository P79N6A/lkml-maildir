Subject: [2.6 patch] dpt_i2o fix for deadlock condition
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Miquel van Smoorenburg <miquels@cistron.nl> forwarded me this fix to
resolve a deadlock condition that occurs due to the API change in
2.6.13+ kernels dropping the host locking when entering the error
handling. They all end up calling adpt_i2o_post_wait(), which if you
call it unlocked, might return with host_lock locked anyway and that
causes a deadlock.
