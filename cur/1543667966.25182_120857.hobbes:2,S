OK.  2.5.66 compiled and booted.
I've jumpered the hardware back to how it was originally when I
experienced the problem.
I've been working happily for about 10 mins with:
while /bin/true; do
        for i in *; do
                cat $i >/dev/ttyUSB0
        done
done
No Oopsen or errors in dmesg as yet. (Before I was getting many errors
about 0 size writes).
I can keep working under 2.5.66 for now to see if I experience any
problems, but it would appear that the race is gone in 2.5.66
(CONFIG_PREEMPT=y)
If you'd like me to try any patches against 2.4 just let me know.
Thanks again,
