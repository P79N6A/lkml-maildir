it is hard to tell with the amount of information provided in bug report (even 
error message is not given). We have three cases here:
root=123456 (real major/minor number) or root=/dev/md2 (literal string). In 
both cases init/do_mount_devfs.c:create_dev() should notice that neither 
/dev/123456 nor /dev/md2 exist, search /dev for ROOT_DEV and create link from 
/dev/root to real device. If it does not work somethig is broken here, people 
who can reproduce it should add printk's to create_dev and find_in_devfs to 
see what happens. It may fail for /dev/md2 if block device name in sysfs 
differs from "md2" because then it won't find correct ROOT_DEV
root=/dev/md/2 (literal string) should work simply because /dev/root is linked 
directly to /dev/md/2
I do not have any raid devices nor possibility to create them so I cannot 
test.
