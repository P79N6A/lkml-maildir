There's sometimes a need to change HZ on i386 systems.  Specifically, 
some IDE drives are unable to safely use DMA (this is documented in one 
of the Kconfig files).  Without DMA for the IDE drives many systems 
experience (a lot of) missed interrupts which can lead to (among other 
things) lost ticks and very erratic and unpredictable behaviour from 
input devices such as the mouse.
Also, if defined in terms of HZ only one definition of these macros 
would be required rather than one for each architecture.
