OIC, then it is clear that SCSI can deal with DSC overlap and granting
bandwidth to the other device on the chain which is not ATAPI.
Sorry Pete, but this is the typical mind set of people who do not
understand all the specification from the past that current hardware is
bound to.  Gadi was very clever in making DSC work.  I understand the
principles but seriously doubt I could have derived what Gadi did.
Cheers,
