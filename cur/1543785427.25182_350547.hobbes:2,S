No.  "unconditional atomic swap" does not mean cmpxchg - it means that
atomic_cmpxchg itself would have to be open coded, which is inefficient.
What you're asking architectures to do is:
retry:
	load
	operation
	save interrupts
	load
	compare
	store if equal
	restore interrupts
	goto retry if not equal
whereas they could have done the far simpler version of:
	save interrupts
	load
	operation
	store
	restore interrupts
which they do today.
The whole point about architecture specific includes is not to provide
a frenzied feeding ground for folk who like to "clean code up" but to
allow architectures to do things in the most efficient way for them
without polluting the kernel too much.
It seems that aspect is being lost sight of here.
