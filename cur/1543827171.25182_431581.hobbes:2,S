two point here:
a) warnings should be made visible at mount time,
   something like printk(KERN_CRIT ...)
b) I don't think you're going to fight all crazy people in the world,
   they'll definitely find a way to break something:
   data or something else.
thanks, Alex
PS. in the end, "extents" option affects *new* files only. and one
    can boot extents-enabled kernel and convert fs back.
