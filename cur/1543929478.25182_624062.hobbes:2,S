Hi Ingo,
This softlockup is seen in the 2.6.24-rc4 either and looks like a message because 
this is seen while running tbench and machine continues running other test's after 
the softlockup messages and some times seen with the bootup, but the machines reaches the 
login prompt and able to continue running tests.
