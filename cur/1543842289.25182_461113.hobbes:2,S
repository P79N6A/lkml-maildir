I'm certainly not convinced that you'd
want that. Think of all the programs that
would have to be marked with CAP_FORK.

This again assumes that you want to require
that in general processes run with some
capabilities.

You betcha. (That's Minnisotan for "Yes indeed")
In our TCSEC B1 (Old person speak for LSPP)
evaluation we had to put way too much effort
into explaining why certain operations that
had nothing to do with the system security
policy (e.g. compute resource limitations)
required privilege. These operations had
no security implications at all, but since
they required privilege they were assumed to
have dire consequences should they be abused.
If you introduce an "underprivileged" process,
you immediately relegate what are currently
unprivileged processes to the realm of
privileged processes. All of a sudden any
process that does fork() requires additional
scrutiny because it uses privilege. You
won't convince any evaluator that there is a
difference between "having a capability" and
"not having lack of capability".
On the other hand if you have "additional
restrictions" available (as in an LSM) that
are not part of the policy enforcement
mechanism there should be no problems.

Further, you can assign any semantic that
makes sense to you. Heaven knows, the POSIX
calculation (from any of the DRAFTS) has
proven to be contentious. Especially in the
inheritence rules on exec.
