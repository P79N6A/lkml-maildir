OK, thanks for that.
From my reading, snd_sb16_probe() is, in the case of !CONFIG_PNP, doing:
	/* block the 0x388 port to avoid PnP conflicts */
	acard->fm_res = request_region(0x388, 4, "SoundBlaster FM");
but this reservation is never undone.  So later, after the module is
unloaded, a read of /proc/ioports is oopsing when trying to access that
string "SoundBlaster FM".  Because it now resides in vfree'd memory.
The fix would be to run release_region() either at the end of
snd_sb16_probe() or on module unload.
Adam or Jaroslav, could you please take care of this?
Thanks.
