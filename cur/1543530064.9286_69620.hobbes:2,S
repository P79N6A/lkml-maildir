Reiserfs has a stable index to a file. It is currently 64bit (32 bit object
ID + ID of the directory). Hans apparently plans to go for longer variable
size keys in the future, although that may not work out given the NFS
limitations. If the 32bit directory key is not available searching the
file is very expensive.
