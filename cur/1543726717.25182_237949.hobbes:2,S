Hello,
I have the same problem with dvd+rw medium that my sony dvd-rom does not read.
I have dvd with some vob files on it and with kernel 2.4.x it could be read
pretty fine but with 2.6.7-bk17 or 2.6.8-rc1-bk3 it results with that errors.
There is an interesting thing. If I burn on that disc different vobs then 
the same files could not be read. (In the mean of naming of files VTS_01_0.BUP
and last two VOBs)
Reading means mount disc and with midnight commander to copy files..
