It's a BIOS issue. I had problems on my MSI nForce3 mainboard because when you 
select the "bootable SATA harddrive", it swaps round the ports so that the 
one you selected is hd0, and the others follow. I couldn't fix it, so in the 
end I just installed grub on both HDs separately, then use the BIOS toggle to 
switch between them.
