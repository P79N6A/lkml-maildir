Two reasons at least:
- the data/address lines are always driven by a buffer when there
a transfer is taking place, while the interrupt lines are permanently
monitored but most of the time only held by passive pull-ups of a
much higher impedance.
- board designers know that the timing of data and addresses are
critical and take care during the layout. Interrupt lines come last
and are routed where there is room left, after all these are low
frequency signals...
