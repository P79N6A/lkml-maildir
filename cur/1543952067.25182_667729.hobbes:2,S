Ramback could be an interesting building block.  Consider using a
couple of systems exporting Ramback devices via Evgeniy's distributed
storage target (or something similiar).  In this case, you can have as
many Ramback devices as you want comprise your mirror set to meet your
availability requirements.  Perhaps people are looking at this too
much as an entire solution as opposed to a piece of a bigger puzzle.
I think the idea has merit.
Cheers,
