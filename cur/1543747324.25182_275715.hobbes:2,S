Linux Developers,
what would you think of say, a line added to modules' code that identifies
compiled-in components?
modprobe could then be adjusted to
1. try loading something.ko
2. looking for a component "something" within the compiled-in stuff
I'd imagine a module's init could look like:
int __init init_module(void) {
	...
	register_static_module("ip_tables");
	...
}
Or using some linker magic to generate a table/array full with strings to
indicate their presence. (I though of kstrtab, which is, to my knowledge, also
composed of multiple single symbols into one.)
Awaiting list feedback.
>A message like "Module ip_tables not needed; support already built in the
>kernel" would be much more helpfull, as I see it.
modprobe should just return 0 as is with the case for already-loaded modules.
