RFC-985 does not take into consideration a system model where IP
addresses are owned by the host not specific interfaces which is a
valid system model that the RFC standards allow.

This RFC is broken in an environment consistent of systems using
the host address ownership model.
It also doesn't consider cases where the host receiving the
ARP request is not aware of all subnets present on a LAN.
Ignoring such ARPs is therefore broken and prevents valid
communications from occuring.
Some systems implement this check to provide "pseudo security",
but it isn't even that.
