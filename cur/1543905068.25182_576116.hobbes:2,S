I did that myself, so that's a non-issue.
No. The complaints were about the CK scheduler not being as responsive 
under load as even the _old_ scheduler was. I don't know why people ignore 
this fact. It was a long thread back in March or April, and I'm pretty 
sure the CK mailing list was cc'd.
Sure, most people don't actually have load-averages above ten etc, but 
it's important to do those well _too_.
