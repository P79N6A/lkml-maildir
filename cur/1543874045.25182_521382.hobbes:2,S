I'm running a e1000xf adapter in a 64-bit/100Mhz PCI slot.  The intel
site shows this is a supported config for the card, but linux is pulling
this info:
ed:02.0 Ethernet controller: Intel Corporation 82544EI Gigabit Ethernet
Controller (Fiber) (rev 02)
	Subsystem: Intel Corporation PRO/1000 XF Server Adapter
	Flags: bus master, 66Mhz, medium devsel, latency 64, IRQ 18

My thoughput tests show it is definitely not running at the 100Mhz bus
rate is should be capable of.
Any ideas on how to make it work at full speed?
