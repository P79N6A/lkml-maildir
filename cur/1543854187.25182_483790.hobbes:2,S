I still think the fastpath should do mb() unconditionally to be correct.

As I see it, currently we don't need this barrier because synchronize_srcu()
does synchronize_sched() before reading ->hardluckref.
But if we add the fastpath into synchronize_srcu() then yes, we need mb()
after atomic_inc().
Unless I totally confused :)
