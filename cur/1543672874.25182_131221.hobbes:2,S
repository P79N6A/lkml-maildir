That was the only thing I could think of too.  I haven't made any attempt
to figure out how much of the code size comes from the various inlined
user-memory copying functions that call access_ok, and could be reworked
not to inline any of the uncommon paths, vs direct uses of access_ok in
miscellaneous code.
