Hi,
I have a LinuxPPC R5 system running on a PowerMac 7200 with the
2.2.12pre8 kernel. 
My problem is my MO-drive from HP see below for type and SCSI-Spec (it's
not SCSI-2)
I got it to work when I preformatted it under MacOS ->  partition-table, partition.
When I boot with the medium inserted the kernel recognizes the MO
without any problem.
I can create a fs on the partiton, I can read/write from/to it. BUT,
when I try to change the side of the media I get the same fs tree as on
the first side.
So I tried booting without media in to verify if it works on the clean
way. This what the dmesg says:

The MO is attached to the 53c94, the behavior on the AHA is the same.
(as I tried last time)
After logging in I inserted a medium and I tried to prepare a fs. It
gave tons of errors on 53c94 which forced me to reboot due to SCSI-bus resetting.
I used pdisk to try to format the media, this is what it complained:
--
53c94: illegal cmd, intr=40 stat=83 seq=83 phase=1
scsi1 channel 0: resetting for second half of retries.
SCSI bus is being reset for host one channel 0.
53c94: illegal cmd, intr=40 stat=83 seq=83 phase=1
SCSI disk error : host 1 channel 0 id 1 lun 0 return code 27070000
scsidisk I/O error: dev 08:14, sector 2
--repeating
--
This repeats and I have to do the reboot (hard way) becomming stable
without the MO.
Has anybody of you same experiences with this type of MO under x86 Linux?
Is it an unsolvable problem due to the fact that it is a SCSI revision
01:CCS device?
Or can I hope?
Thanks for any hints, and sorry for the long post but I felt to include
this msgs to explain.
Andreas
P.S: this is the line when the media is inserted on booting
SCSI device sde: hdwr sector= 1024 bytes. Sectors= 637041 [622 MB] [0.6 GB]
