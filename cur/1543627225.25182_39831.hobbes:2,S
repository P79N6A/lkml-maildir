I think the device is configured properly because a windows driver exists and 
it's working correctly. But what do I have to do on the driver side according 
to the type of the interrupt? Is there any difference from the driver's point 
if view?
Both needs the interrupt flag to be cleared.

The company uses the 9050 in a C-PCI system. The card is designed in 98 or 99. 
So the card is produced and there are existing products using it. (of course 
these are only windows based). But thanks for the info, I will mention the 
hot swapable problem using the 9050. But I think this feature is delayed at 
least until I develop the driver.
I suggested already to implement this feature in the driver if the hw supports 
it but they couldn't tell me whether it supports.
