The way it is implemented in reiserfs is to wait for existing transactions
to complete, entirely flush the journal and block all new transactions from
starting.  Stephen implemented a journal flush API to do this for ext3, but
the hooks to call it from LVM are not in place yet.  This way the journal is
totally empty at the time the snapshot is done, so the read-only copy does
not need to do journal recovery, so no problems can arise.
Cheers, Andreas
