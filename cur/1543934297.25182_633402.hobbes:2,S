"only" an additional parameter. The whole _point_ behind these markers 
is for them to have minimal effect!

this is a general policy matter. It is _so much easier_ to add markers 
if they _can_ have near-zero overhead (as in 1-2 instructions). 
Otherwise we'll keep arguing about it, especially if any is added to 
performance-critical codepath. (where we are counting instructions)

you are still missing my point. Firstly, the kernel is regparm built so 
there's no call frame to be pushed to in most cases - we pass most 
parameters in registers. (hence my stressing of minimizing the number of 
parameters to an absolute minimum)
Secondly, the side-effects of a function call is what i referred to via:
> [...]  (and some minimal disturbance to the variables the tracepoint

really, a tracepoint obviously accesses data that is readily accessible 
in that spot. Worst-case we'll have some additional register constraints 
that make the code a bit less optimal.
Yes, if a trace point references data that is _not_ readily available, 
then of course the preparation for the function call might not be cheap. 
But that can be optimized by placing the tracepoints intelligently.
what cannot be optimized away at all are the conditional instructions 
introduced by the probe points, extra parameters and the space overhead 
of the function call itself.
