I just want to hear a good reason to create attributes individually. :)
Especially in conjunction with kobject_register(), these attributes are
not available at uevent time, which is really really bad.
Default attributes just work fine, and have the proper error handling
built-in. Offering special functions for it, may just encourage people
to continue this "broken" way of creating attributes.
So I really object, unless we get a good example why it's needed. :)
