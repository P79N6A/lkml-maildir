probably just the sources... i built a bunch of gentoo on a flaky machine, and 
ran into trouble with mozilla. it was mozilla 1.6 that demostrated the 
problems and prevented me from continuing to build gnome. i ended up 
rebuilding the whole thing on a speedy box over a weekend, for a far weaker 
architecture that wasn't flaky (despite 4 or 5 brutal soldering adventures on 
the motherboard!!!)
