None what so ever, but I always think of msync as a rare function
(infrequent when compared to (minor) faults overall). But I don't have
numbers backing that up either.
Also, the radix tree scan you do isn't exactly cheap either. 
So what I was wondering is whether its worth optimizing this at the cost
of another rmap walker. (one with very dubious semantics at that - it
clears the pte dirty bit but doesn't particularly care about that nor
does it respect the PG_dirty / PTE dirty relation)
