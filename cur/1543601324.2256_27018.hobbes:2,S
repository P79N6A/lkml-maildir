Hello Alan and Erik,
The Linux Kernel mailing list does not seem to be
bearing any fruit with this APM/ACPI issue regarding
clean power-off/reboot.  Are there any other groups
that you are aware of that might have interest in
investigating this bug?

**************************************************
I still have linux-2.4.9-ac9, with the dmi_scan.c patch,
and the APM configured as you suggested.  My computer
bios is set to ACPI=off (even with this 'on' the behavior
is the same).
shutdown -h    works correctly
shutdown -r    hangs at "Restarting System".
