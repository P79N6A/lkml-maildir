ok, lets keep it then. It may in fact simplify the domain setup code: we 
could generate the 'most generic' layout for a given arch all the time, 
and then optimize it automatically. I.e. in theory we could have just a 
single domain-setup routine, which would e.g. generate the NUMA domains 
on SMP too, which would then be optimized away.
