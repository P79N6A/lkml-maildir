That looks exactly like what I'd expect to see if the disk returned a
bad block in the middle of an inode table.  In particular, the
filesystem is correctly returning a clean EIO error to the application
rather than getting itself tied up in knots over the error.
Looks like the kernel was working perfectly here...
