Either I'm asleep or you are emulating bsrl, not bsfl. It
should rather be:
	if ( y & 0x00000001) return 1;
	if ( y & 0x00000002) return 2;
	if ( y & 0x00000004) return 3;
	...
	if ( y & 0x80000000) return 32;
	return 0;
No need for the else clauses either because of the return.
But maybe even __builtin_ffs(y) would work in this case.
