Maybe you should read that latest kernel source code.  Particularly
generic_make_request in block/ll_rw_blk.c.
The comment preceding it read:
/*
 * We only want one ->make_request_fn to be active at a time,
 * else stack usage with stacked devices could be a problem.
 * So use current->bio_{list,tail} to keep a list of requests
 * submited by a make_request_fn function.
 * current->bio_tail is also used as a flag to say if
 * generic_make_request is currently active in this task or not.
 * If it is NULL, then no make_request is active.  If it is non-NULL,
 * then a make_request is active, and new requests should be added
 * at the tail
