I've changed the value of vm_mapped_ratio to 20 - which has a default 
value of 100 - I guess you're talking about vm_cache_scan_ratio?
I've tried changing just vm_cache_scan_ratio to 20, but it doesn't seem 
to make any difference - I though a higher vm_cache_scan_ratio value 
meant less is scanned?
