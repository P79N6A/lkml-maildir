Hi Artur,
nice work!
Yes, you spotted a few places which I missed.
Without looking into details, I saw a place, where I did HZ conversion where
you did not, but I may be completely wrong with it:

  	for (i = 0 ; i < NR_IRQS ; i++)
  		sum += kstat_irqs(i);

This seems to be the right thing to do, IMO. You should put a comment about
the fact, that only multiples of 100 are allowed, 1024 eg. is not.
(You would get very inaccurate results.)
You may want to merge your patch with one from 
 Harald Koerfgen <Harald.Koerfgen@home.ivm.de>
on
 
ftp://ftp.linux.sgi.com/pub/linux/mips/test/hz_patch.gz
He mailed me about necessary changes for his MIPS work. I did not yet find
time to answer him, but maybe you can contact him and get the changes merged.
Basically, independance of userspace from the internal HZ is good. This is
also Linus' opinion, IIRC, and you have got good chances that your patch will
go into the kernel (without the Makefile change, of course) if you submit it
to him. But look at it again in order to not miss anything ...
