Well I see two oddities in the example. You call exit() not _exit() so
the child will duplicate various queued stdio of the parent. Doesn't
seem to be relevant however.
Secondly and I suspect of importance you don't do anything with SIGCLD
so you are inheriting a random status. If the child signal is being
ignored then it will be cleared automatically. In that situation your
code functionality depends solely upon which thread runs first.
