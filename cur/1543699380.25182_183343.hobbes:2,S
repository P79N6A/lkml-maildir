Subject: RAID5 resync blocking on 2.6.0-test11

Hi LKML,
I've just installed a software-RAID 5 on my Alpha (miata) Workstation 
500au with Kernel 2.6.0-test11. The RAID is made of 4 Western Digital 
250Gb HDs on a promise-ata-133tx2.
The initial raidstart and mke2fs worked fine. After the initial sync, a 
clean boot and a new raidstart, the /proc/mdstat reported that the drive 
was at "resync" (/var/log/messages says that "raid array is not clean").
The problem is, the resync was blocking the /dev/md0. So, when I did a 
'mount /dev/md0', it blocked until the resync was done (and it was a 
looong time for a nearly 1TB RAID).
Looking through driver/md code I've realized that md_do_sync() was the 
real devil. After a few diffs with 2.4.23 code I've realized that at the 
speed limiter part of the function, the old "current->nice = " lines 
were deleted.
After a few more search (and looking through LXR) at 
/fs/jffs2/background.c and /net/bluetooth/bnep/core.c I've realized that 
some people have changed "current->nice =" statements to 
"set_user_nice(current,...)" ones.
Done that. The RAID worked just fine (still resyncing at boot, not fully 
tested yet) but don't block mounts anymore (btw, mount returns a lot 
faster than with 2.4.23).
Since I'm no kernel (nor RAID) expert (first post here, btw), just 
wandering if I did something really stupid or not.
Also, is this an Alpha-only issue? Or a 2.6.0 issue?
Anyway, here follows the patch for what I've done.
thanks for the attention.
