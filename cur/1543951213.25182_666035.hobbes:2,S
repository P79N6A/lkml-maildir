I think your logic is sound.  But for paranoia's sake I would add
a BUG_ON(signal->flags & SIGNAL_GROUP_EXIT) in the group-fatal case.
I don't really like dropping the signal on the floor.  If the posting says
it succeeded (vs -ESRCH) then I'd like to see it appear later in the
pending set of the zombie thread, when we look at /proc/pid/status at exit
tracing or whatnot (and in core dumps).  Seeing those pending signal bits
is sometimes a useful clue about how something died in a strange scenario.
Thanks,
Roland
