No problem. Just swap the relevant labels over in the first column.
As far as the tweak I proposed (and which I've finished creating for
`make config` and have nearly finished for `make menuconfig` as well),
the whole entry, along with that for any other "Technical Acronyms"
(TM) that one wishes to define in the same way, are simple entries at
the top of Configure.help and can easily be edited by anybody willing
to apply fingers to keycaps.
The only question I'm really interested in hearing answers to is this:
	What other acronyms used in Configure.help could use
	defining in this manner for kernel newbies?
Any takers willing to supply both the acronym and a definition thereof?
Best wishes from Riley.
