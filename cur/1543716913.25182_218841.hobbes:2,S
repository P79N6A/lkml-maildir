That's a misdiagnosis.  The problem here is that the kernel is taking a
pagefault within show_trace(), and the pagefault handler calls
show_trace().  It has gone infinitely recursive.
The bug is unrelated to the stack size.  It is in show_trace() or
thereabouts.  That code tries to protect itself from recursive faults, but
it's a vendor kernel and may be different from the public tree.
