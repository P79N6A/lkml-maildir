To make a long story short I found the problem. For some reasons unknown to
me I had Pentium II listed in one of the config files. Since I have no
Pentium II this makes no sense at all.
And as usual I forgot again that lftp'2 mirror command does not touch file
in the current working dir starting with '.'.
Sorry.
