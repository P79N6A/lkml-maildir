however, this is broken.  linux relies on being able to do
read_lock(x);
func()
  -> func()
       -> func()
            -> read_lock(x);
if a writer comes between those two read locks, you're toast.
i suspect the right answer for the contention you're seeing is an improved
get_timeofday which is lockless.
