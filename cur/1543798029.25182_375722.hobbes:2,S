Removing features because there are better solutions is one thing, 
although it has been done at kernel tree changes for a decade. Removing 
features for reasons of religion is rather a case of developers removing 
a useful and unbroken feature for which there is no replacement purely 
because someone doesn't like it, or it saves a dozen lines of code.
