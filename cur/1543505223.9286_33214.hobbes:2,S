Yes, but I personally don't consider either of them, for reasons
that are related to compatibility mostly...

Right.  Neither will work in minicom or Telix, and is one of my
main concerns as well.

Well, any piece of hardware requires the CPU to do something to
send it data.  A real modem minimalizes this to the bare minimum.
The higher the CPU to modem bps is set, the lower the overhead.
I would consider a normal modem the baseline for comparison.

Right.

I disagree.  I am currently downloading RedHat hedwig updates
from their site.  I am using a REAL 33.6k modem, and am getting a
constant rate of about 3.5 to 3.6k through the modem.  I have no
processes on the system consuming any CPU (all are idle).  I just
did a "top" reniced to 19 to watch the system load from the
modem, etc..
Top consistently shows a 98.x% idle CPU, with the "user" portion
fluctuating between 0.0 and 1.3 percent, average around .7 or so,
and the system fluctuating between 1% and 5%.  With the modem
disabled, these numbers stay the same except system load is very
slightly less.  I would say negligable.
Hardware modems cause a CPU interrupt when the buffer is empty,
and then it gets filled and the modem does it's thing.  With
even a 386 computer, a 56k modem doesn't load the system much at
all.  One could fill their system with UART's and have them all
pumping data out fullstream, and not likely notice much going on
at all.  Even 8 kilobytes per second from a modem is nothing with
a 40Mhz processor, let alone a 200Mhz processor.
So, I must be misunderstanding what you're meaning here, because
I know that you know a lot about hardware, etc...  Could you
explain it a bit more what you mean?

Well, I can't say for type 1 winmodems.  I do know that aside
from CPU and other resource beatings, that the things are NOT
compatible with all software.  Software that talks directly to
the modem by opening the UART ports, will fail under any
winmodem, and this is also a major cause of problem from a lot of
people that I have worked with.
Compatibility is zero.

Yep.  Very unfortunately...

Right.  ;o)  The things might work fine for someone that doesn't
use them.  ;o)  Or someone that uses them minimally.  Others get
disconnected frequently, and never consider that it is their
modem that causes this when they fire up 5 apps simultaneously
for example.  ;o)

I've seen it happen in practically every computer store I've been
in for a while.  You overhear the salesperson selling the thing,
and people blindly buy them up.  The ones smart enough to ask,
are dumb enough to trust the salesman's promise that it will work
fine.
Even the boxes on the things are vague most of the time.  I
always state that the thing will be used in a Linux machine 
and that Winmodems and software modems of any shape or form 
as well as Plug and Play and PCI modems are completely
unacceptable.  The salesman looks confused right about then 
with a "well what else IS there? look on his face", and
then when he comes back from talking to someone who does in 
fact know, I DEMAND that I get to RIP open the box and look the
card over as well as the documentation.  I would say a good 50%
of the time it is STILL a winmodem/softmodem after all that.
Imagine the poor soul that doesn't know the difference...

Your chart basically confirms my price statements.  One could get
a low end hardware modem for the same price or cheaper than one
of the winmodem types except for the extreme low end which are
likely to be replaced very soon after purchase.  ;o)

USR's are over $100 here I believe.  I put them in for customers
with business systems, etc.. for their name brand.  For other
systems, I go with el-cheapo stuff which I've found to work
admirably.  Zoltrix for example:  I've installed over 50 zoltrix
modems (hardware modems) and not seen a single one go bad.  They
have 5 year warranties and are the cheapest of the lot to buy.

Well, I don't see how that works unless you pay by the minute for
local telephone access, but I generally agree.  What you save on
your winmodem, you will pay for replacing it down the road, maybe
several times.  Or, you will pay a consultant to come and install
the drivers for it, or pay the computer store to get it working.
People often pay me my $30/hr to get their systems running.  One
of the problems is ALWAYS winmodems.  Sometimes it takes me 10
minutes, sometimes 2 hours.  At $30/hr, they're cheaper off
getting a REAL modem - and I tell them that.  They often go and
buy it themselves, and come back with ANOTHER winmodem.  ;o)

Right, but only if it is stressed enough, and the people doing
the installation are competant.

I completely agree as well.  Winmodems are causing the hold back

I think that most people "in the know" so to speak, are also in
agreement as well.  I believe I misunderstood something that you
said at the top though, so feel free to set me straight on it, or
ignore it.  We should move this to private email though, before
the flames begin...
