When it is supported in BIOS, you will see a HPET line similar to below
in initial ACPI messages.
ACPI: OEMB (v001 A M I  AMI_OEM  0x05000510 MSFT 0x00000097) @
0xdffdf040
ACPI: HPET (v001 A M I  OEMHPET  0x05000510 MSFT 0x00000097) @
0xdffd7480
And when it is supported in BIOS, kernel always uses it.
Thanks,
Venki
