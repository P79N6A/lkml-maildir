looks good, hardware helps here ;) really I was trying to do it with
math, not with hardware but sounds like this is the best we can do.
doing it with unsigned long retval and 1UL is probably better.
This is likely a candidate to go in include/linux/kernel.h (maybe under
the name roundup_pow_of_two to avoid misunderstanding with the much more
common PAGE_SIZE roundups)
thanks!
