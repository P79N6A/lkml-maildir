Per-user resource limits will avoid monkeys from doing that stuff.
Unfortunately only 2.6 kernel will have this feature, but distribution
vendors will probably use a backported version for 2.4.
Linux per-user resource limits are called "user beancounters", and you can
find a development version at www.asplinux.com.sg/install/ubpatch.html.
Currently there is only kernel-level code. 
A userlevel PAM module is needed to make it usable for real systems.
SGI's CSA (
http://oss.sgi.com/projects/csa,
 no code available yet) is a
similar, but more complete per-user resource accouting scheme which will
be ported to Linux in the future.
