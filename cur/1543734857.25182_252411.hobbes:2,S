with file locking in /var/run I didn't necessairly meant to call
flock(2), the fifo in your example would act like a mutex lock, but more
than the fifo, we need a bit more of API, the dev.d script will have to
look for a certain file in /var/run and block on it to serialize. I just
hope the spin loops will go away soon from the userspace ;)
