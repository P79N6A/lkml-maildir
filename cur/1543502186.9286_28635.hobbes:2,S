If you're planning on upgrading a box that is running 1.2.13 to
2.2.x, and only by replacing the kernel, you'll quickly find that
you're trying to do something that will result in a lot of wasted
man hours fiddling around.
Backup the system, all important data, etc.. and reinstall a new
modern distribution like RedHat 6.0 or 5.2, and then restore your
pertinent data, and get things running again.
Trying to upgrade a 2.0.x system to 2.2.x is a pain enough, let
alone going from 1.2.x...   All old binaries would be a.out on
the 1.2.x system, etc...  Not worth the trouble...
By the way, your email address From: field is really screwed,
please change it to something that is not 10 miles long and full
of foreign characters.
