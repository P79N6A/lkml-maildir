Nathan, my patch is not a nuclear reactor - it is just a simple
enhancement. I am not even suggesting something exotic or extraordinary
- it is a well-documented Intel thing. It is a simple matter of "Intel
chips can do it - therefore Linux should have the brains to make use of
it". If it is dangerous - don't use it but don't say "don't implement
fire because someone might burn her fingers" :)
Your points may be valid wrt to whether Intel's approaches are
better/worse than "other guys'" but that is not being discussed. That
you should say to Intel engineers and not to Linux kernel engineers. I
don't care what features Intel processor(s) have but if the features are
there and potentially useful the kernel should support them. Period.
Regards,
Tigran.
