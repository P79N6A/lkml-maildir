Several people sent suggestions on this topic when you
asked this question on linux-arm-kernel last week (which
was BTW a far more appropriate list for this).
I notice you didn't follow up on those suggestions in
any way.  Before you ask again, it'd be polite to try
following the suggestions you've already received.
