I suspect that this discussion belongs off-list, because it apparently comes
up frequently.
But an observation from a Linux-Kernel "outsider":
Multilanguage developement (meaning using more than one language in the
product) makes any product harder to develop.  Because Linux is in C
originally for good reasons, it should probably remain in C until and unless
such time as a significant reason for a rewrite arrives.
Since Linux is trying to be, in some sense, "the last best Un*x" (apologies
to various people,) it makes sense that it should be written in "the last
best procedural language."
