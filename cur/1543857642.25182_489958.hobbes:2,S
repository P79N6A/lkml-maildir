Hi there,
Well, that's kind of difficult because it looks a little random when he
does it, and a interval of three days, but also is maybe random.
And the most difficult part is it's only for three seconds, and than it's
gone, so making a crontab script every minute might not even notice it?
Or am I just making a mistake here?
Thanks!
Jim.
