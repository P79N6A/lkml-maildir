BTW, what way do you recommened to fix this register-stack/memory-stack upside
down problem ?
Plan A) just handle upside-down case in page fault handler.
	This means ulimit -s limitation will limit amount of memory-stack and
	register stack independently.
Plan B) handle upside-down case in page fault handler and add modify 
 	acct_stack_growth() to be able to handle the limitation of sum
	of separated vmas.(vma for reg stack and mem stack). 
Plan C) don't allow this upside down as this patch. but change calculation of rbs_top.
Note:
To see the problem which my patch want to fix run following code under ulimit -s.
==
void eat_stack(int num) {
	printf("%d\n", num);
	eat_stack(num - 1);
}
int main (void) {
	eat_stack(10000);
}
