Sorry I missed this when it came out, but,  I think a better way to handle this 
is to use an IPI.  In the non-VST case it can be to all but self, while when a 
given cpu is sleeping we can not send it to that cpu.  The advantages are:
1) The broadcast has a race/ contention on the xtime lock.  The read lock is 
needed by all and the write lock taken by one.  The IPI should be sent AFTER the 
xtime write unlock.
2) It is easy to prune VST sleeping cpus from the list of all to wake.
