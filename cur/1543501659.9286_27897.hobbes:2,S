mtrr.txt gives a brief explanation as to how to set MTRRs. Unfortunately (for 
me), this seems to imply one has a processor of Intel P6 family. I would like to 
have some more information on the following points:
- /proc/mtrr is empty, before I set up MTRRs. Is this ok ? According   to 
mtrr.txt, the first two MTRRs seem already set. I know K6 has only two MTRRs.
- I can create MTRRs by executing :
echo "base=0xe4000000 size=0x400000 type=write-combining" > /proc/mtrr
This sets up only the first register. Is this ok ? When I run mtrr-show, it 
gives
Register: 0 base: 0xe4000000 size: 0x400000 type: write-combining
Register: 1 disabled
Can I leave the second register disabled ? If not, how do I have to set it up ?
- Is there a simple way of measuring the perfomance ?
Thank you for your attention.
