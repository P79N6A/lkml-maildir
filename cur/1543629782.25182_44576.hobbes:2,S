I think I follow
You have
	Compiler ordering
	CPU v CPU memory ordering
	CPU v I/O memory ordering
	I/O v I/O memory ordering
and our current heirarchy is a little bit more squashed than that. I'd 
agree. We actually hit a corner case of this on the IDT winchip x86 where
we run relaxed store ordering and have to define wmb() as a locked add of
zero to the top of stack - which does have a penalty that isnt needed
for CPU ordering.
How much of this impacts Mips64 ?
