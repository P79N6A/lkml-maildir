Subject: Does cli() need to be called before reading avenrun?

In kernel 2.4, in sys_sysinfo(), the code reads:
   cli();
   val.uptime = jiffies / HZ;
   val.loads[0] = avenrun[0] << (SI_LOAD_SHIFT - FSHIFT);
   val.loads[1] = avenrun[1] << (SI_LOAD_SHIFT - FSHIFT);
   val.loads[2] = avenrun[2] << (SI_LOAD_SHIFT - FSHIFT);
   val.procs = nr_threads-1;
   sti();
In loadavg_read_proc, the code is in essence the same, except that it
isn't wrapped in cli/sti.  
Is there a reason for the cli?
