Final user doesn't. It is a job for whoever writes the program, or packages
it for a distro. If even required.

Anything like this that can be accessed by plain users (not root) is
inherently dangerous. It is for a reason that only root can increase the
priority of a process. If you allow reniceing and place some kind of limit
on it, even Aunt Tillie will run her programs with priority maxed out, and
we are back were we are today.
