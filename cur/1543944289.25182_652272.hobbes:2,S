FWIW, I definitely have a (vocal minority) group of contributors
who resent all the rebasing.  There may be a few cases of 'vanity'
represented here, but there are definitely reasonable complaints about
not being able to do simple pulls to stay up-to-date and/or having
to rebase before they can send patches to me.  FWIW, I think it might
save a bit of my time as well, although I have become pretty good and
"riding the tide" of rebasing... :-(
Unfortunately, I don't have any good suggestions to remedy the issue.
One strategy might be a third layer of trees, e.g.:
	net-2.6			fixes for the current release
	net-2.6.26		updates certain to go to the next release
	net-2.6.26-maybe	updates that might not make it to the next release
Of course, managing what goes moves-up from -maybe is probably a big
headache, and just sucks-up more of Dave's time.  And, of course,
virtually no one will run the -maybe tree...
Just my $0.02...
