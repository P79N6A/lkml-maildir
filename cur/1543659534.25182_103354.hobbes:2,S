Hi,
i put my hdd to a different computer, which has:
00:1f.5 Multimedia audio controller: Intel Corp. 82820 820 (Camino 2)
Chipset AC'97 Audio Controller (rev 12)
i noticed that when i play music with xmms it has the habit of changing
the sampling rate to something that sounds like 11k, (sharp aliased sound)
when eg. i open/close windows, click, etc. I know that i810 can handle
only 48k, i changed xmms preferences to play at 48k, but it still does it.
The previous computer had an sb live and it was fine.
Did anybody notice similar behaviour with this driver / chip ?
Regards,
Maciej
