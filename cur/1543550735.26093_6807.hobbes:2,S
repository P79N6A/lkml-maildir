Good! I hope to meet you next week at ALS as I'm giving a pitch on DProbes
next Thursday. When is your session?
The P-tree by the way is described by Knuth but was modiifed slightly when
deployed in HPFS. There are some details of it around  - see If I still
have any unclassified info - actually come to think of it I might be
confusing the in-memory representation of the file system with what's on
disk - my memory is getting dim when I comes to OS2.

I am currently preparing slides for the ALS presentation next week in
Atlanta, and this should be a start.  The assembly of the various parts
of the documentation is in progress.

Um, I haven't got a clue because I don't know anything about the
internals of either of them.  Do you have some relevant details you can
supply?

:-(  OK, I'll go back into the document and try to make it more clear.
