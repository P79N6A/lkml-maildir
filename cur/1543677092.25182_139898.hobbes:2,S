Follow the traces from pins A3 and A11 on the edge connector, they'll lead
you to the 0 ohm resistor jumpers (Just look for the little rectangular
things that have a 0 printed on them where others have numbers).
Make sure they are the ones for A3 and A11, and remove 'em. Voila, an AGP 
2.0 card.
(These are on the ATI 9700 reference design, which all manufacturers have 
copied so far, your Hercules will probably have them too, although it's 
a 9800 I'm assuming)
