I'm not sure if this is related, but I've noticed a major performance
issue starting in 2.5.32 (and still present in .33) on a dual celeron
system that has otherwise been working fine for a couple of years with all
kinds of bleeding edge kenels.  Some initial profiling output is showing
up to a factor of 10x the number of clock ticks and load for kernel
compiles and local copying of kernel trees.  hdparm -t is showing a 25%
decrease in throughput.  This is an IDE system with a PIIX4 controller.
If time permits, I'll do some more investigation.
