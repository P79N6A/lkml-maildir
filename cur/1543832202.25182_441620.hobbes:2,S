ia64 allnoconfig is (and has been for a while) broken for other reasons.
Almost all of the real configurations still build.  The only error
that adding this turned up was building a generic uniprocessor config.
smp_call_function_single() is used without a prototype by
arch/ia64/sn/kernel/sn2/sn_hwperf.c:sn_hwperf_op_cpu()
This isn't a real error because this function actually does return
an "int", so the complier default is correct (plus the caller doesn't
look at the return value, plus on a UP we'd never be able to get to
this call-site because it is in the "else" !!!).
But I'll fix it anyway.
