I will explain later...
However each key is to broadcasts its identity for the authorized
host/application.  This every license that uses CPRM is trackable.  Since
the method is exotic enough and you can only get the matrix pillars from
the LC4 people, crack will be tough.  There is a 1Meg hidden CPRM space
for key tracking and other services that are unknown.
How it works is still a fuzzy thought, even for the LC4 people.
I have to kill this timeout bug or people will scream bloody murder.
