Well, I may have mis-stated my intentions in the last email. What I want
to see is some mechanism and *code* to test these interfaces and verify
that the low (AND high) level code is actually adhering to the interface,
as well as attemp to isolate which side of an interface a failure has
occured on. I want fault isolation, and TESTING to make sure that any 
fault we have seen in the past can be detected with easy-to run code.
