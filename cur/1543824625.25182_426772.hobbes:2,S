... because of the compat stuff. Maybe that should be split into a
separate file after some time.

this isn't persistent firmware, it's microcode. That is volatile, to the
point that if you reboot (but that effect is also achieved at cpu S3 or
do cpu hotplug) you need to reload it. These types of events are
something the kernel knows about in general, but userspace.. not so.
(esp since you generally want to load microcode as early as possible)
