Jeff,
I apologize for the incredibly late reply.  Your objection of course
came up mere hours after I left on a vacation of nearly two weeks.
I also apologize for failing to CC linux-ide.  I did, however,
originally CC the author of the Vitesse VSC driver (Jeremy Higdon).
The patch was submitted precisely because the PCI device ID was no
longer going to be single-use.  In fact, shortly after the message
you posted below, Andrew posted the following (which has been queued
up for a month or so):
	[patch 187/200] SGI IOC4: Detect IO card variant
In short, due to the unusual card design of the SGI IO10 card, and
the need to differentiate it from the SGI PCI-RT card, I was left
with no reasonable option other than to look for the existence of
the Vitesse device at a known PCI bus location.  As such I needed
to re-use the PCI ID of the Vitesse part, thereby making it dual-use
and qualifying it for assignment of a PCI_DEVICE_ID_xxx constant.
I did perhaps overstep by also creating a PCI_DEVICE_ID_xxx constant
for the purportedly identical Intel part.  Am I allowed a third apology
within a single email?
Brent
