Well I would, but I'm not confident if all the options (a) still work
and (b) are "safe/supported".  The only people who can answer those
questions are the likes of Linus and/or the authors of the targets,
unless they are prepared to wade through all the code with a microscope
looking for potential problems.  I like to use my time efficiently if
possible and that's not the kind of thing I can do efficiently.
For example, do you think an ordinary mortal can just inspect the code
and figure out when he does and doesn't need to do "make mrproper"?
(AFAICS, patching a makefile isn't caught by the dependencies, which
seems odd.)
I admit things have improved since my last inspection (make oldconfig is
now mentioned in the README - well done whoever :-).
cheers
Neil
