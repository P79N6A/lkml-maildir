for sanity purposes we generally define spanned volumes each composed of 
one disk. this still bites you ocasionaly because the controller will 
pause when one or more disks are missing which otherwise may or may not be 
catostrophic ie if you have a software raid-5 raid 1 or 10 stripe it'll 
probably do fine with one disk missing, but the promise will freak again.

non-raid sata or pata promise cards are darn cheap...
