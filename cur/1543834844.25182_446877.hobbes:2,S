No, I disagree, if the code is well commented, it is easier to read the
whole thing at the end when it has its greatest coherence and
refinement.  A problem with Reiser4 is that its core algorithms are
simply complex.  We pushed the envelope in multiple areas all at once.
Benchmarks don't always suggest simple algorithms are the ones that will
be highest performance.  Tree algorithms are notorious in the database
industry for being simple on web pages but complex as code.
Some people program in small increments, some program things that
require big increments of change, both kinds of people are needed.
