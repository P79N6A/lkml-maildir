Yes, it has 4 cpus

I tried something similar, I added an activated field, which is set
to true when the ->create() callback is invoked. That did not help
either, the machine still panic'ed.

I see the need for it, but I wonder if we should start with that
right away. I understand that people might want to group cpusets
differently from their grouping of let's say the cpu resource
manager. I would still prefer to start with one hierarchy and then
move to multiple hierarchies. I am concerned that adding complexity
upfront might turn off people from using the infrastructure.
