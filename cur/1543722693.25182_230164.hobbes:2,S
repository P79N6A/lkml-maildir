Couldn't most of this be done in userspace with xattrs and a "elastic
quota" daemon?  Mark such files as elastic with an xattr, and when space
is needed for user N, the daemon comes along and deletes the marked
files.  You could even make the deamon semi-smart and take things such
as filesize, least recently used files, etc into account.
Or maybe I am missing something... wouldn't be the first time.
