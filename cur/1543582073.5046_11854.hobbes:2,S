Well, I figured it might reduce deadweight time between the different
operations (disk reads, cache operations, network I/O) at the expense of a
little throughput.  It was just a hunch and I don't fully understand the
internals (of any of this, really).  Since I wasn't saturating the disk or
network controller, I thought the gain from quicker response time (for
packet acknowledgement, etc.) would outweigh the loss of individual
throughputs.  Again, I could be misunderstanding this completely. :)

Well, I backed out that particular patch, and it didn't seem to make much
of a difference either way.  I'll look at it in more detail tomorrow
though.
