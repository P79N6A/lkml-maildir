2.6.16.y is special in that Adrian Bunk took it upon himself to
maintain that branch more or less indefinately. But that's not how
-stable normally works, it's Adrians own project.
The normal way -stable works is that it tracks the latest 2.6.x kernel
that has been released.
Now that 2.6.21 has been released, a final flush of the patch queue
against 2.6.20 is done, that will be 2.6.20.10, and then -stable will
switch to 2.6.21.y, when 2.6.22 comes out a final 2.6.21.y is made and
then it's off to track 2.6.22
The rules for what is suitable for a -stable release etc is written in
Documentation/stable_kernel_rules.txt
I believe the above reflects reality - if I've said something wrong I
assume Greg will correct me :)
