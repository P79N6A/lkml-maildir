"g" allows immediates, which is _not_ correct.

You're over-estimating gcc builtins, and underestimating inline
assembly. 
gcc builtins usually generate _worse_ code than well-written inline
assembly, since builtins try to be generic (at least the ones that are
cross-architecture).
And inline asms schedule as well as any built-in, unless they are marked
volatile (either explicitly or implicitly by not having any outputs).
And the proof is in the pudding: I'll bet you a dollar my code generates
better code. AND my code works on the intel compiler _and_ with older
gcc's.
The fact is, gcc builtins are almost never worth it.
