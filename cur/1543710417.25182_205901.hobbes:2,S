Not really - it would be a 1:1 map... so what would be the purpose?
The problem is in the audit - the server would report a violation in
uid xxx. Which according to it's records is not used on the penetrated client
(at least not via the filesystem). Yet the administrator would report that the
uid is valid (because of a bogus local map).
Double mapping also doubles the audit complications :-)
