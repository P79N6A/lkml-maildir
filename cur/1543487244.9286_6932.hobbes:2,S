linux 2.2.2-ac2 fail to compile drivers/block/ide-cd.c with the error
ide-cd.c: In function `ide_cdrom_init':
ide-cd.c:3217: `ignore' undeclared (first use this function)
ide-cd.c:3217: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
ide-cd.c:3217: for each function it appears in.)
After a quick look there dose seam to be the 'char *ignore' if compiled
as a module but not if included in the kernel at line 3185.
code that uses it added by patch at line 3217 ....
if (ignore != NULL)
	if(strstr(ignore, drive->name) {
		printk("ide-cd: ignoring drive %s\n", drive-name);
		continue;
	}
Should this be only be included if compiled as a module?
Please could you also CC any replys to paul.gammans@brunel.ac.uk
regards paul
