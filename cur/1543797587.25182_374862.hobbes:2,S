I did it, but it is not better ..... but perhaps due to an upgrade on my
debian Sid it seems
that I have not so much IDE errors but this impossibility to open any
terminal is already here ...
I tried one Debian pre-packaged kernel and it works , I mean nearly no
IDE errors
and no more problems with opening gnome-terminal, so it would mean that
here is a problem
in my kernel config ??
Here is an extract of the - so mentioned in the doc - important settings :
# Pseudo filesystems
#
CONFIG_PROC_FS=y
CONFIG_PROC_KCORE=y
CONFIG_SYSFS=y
CONFIG_TMPFS=y
# CONFIG_HUGETLBFS is not set
# CONFIG_HUGETLB_PAGE is not set
CONFIG_RAMFS=y
# CONFIG_RELAYFS_FS is not set
Where should I look to solve it definetely ??
Thanks for your answer.
