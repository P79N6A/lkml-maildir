Thank you! looks splice has significant advantage :)

This maybe shows cost of gathering page-cache.

This shows read/write system-call and user program cost. right ?

This shows 10240MiB copy_to_user() cost.
BTW, How big are cpu-cache-size and read/write buffer size in this test ?

read from a file and write to lo ?
