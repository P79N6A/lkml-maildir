One thing to try might be to just assume that the keyboard controller is a
slow device (it is), and use "inb_p()" instead of "inb()" etc for the
definition of kbd_read_input() and friends. Just edit the file
	include/asm-i386/keyboard.h
if you have a keyboard problem, and replace the inb's and "inb_p"s and the
outb's with "outb_p"s.
It will give you only one us rather than seven, but seven us is just so
incredibly slow that I can't imagine that it should matter these days.
