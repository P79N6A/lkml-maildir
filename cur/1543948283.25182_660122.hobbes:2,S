Duh - of course not.  I only presented that line to demonstrate that all
three words 'mode', 'mode_flags', and 'flags' appeared in the same context.

How about picking less vacuous names than variations of mode and flag,
so that it's easier for the reader to distinguish without having to
read and understand an entire chunk of code first.

My patch for this had explicit bit fields, which made the names clearer:
+       int mask_opts_rel:1;    /* c.original_mask is relative */
+       int mask_opts_abs:1;    /* c.original_mask is absolute */
+       /* if neither rel nor abs, then use c.latest_cpuset_mask */
You chose not to do that, which obfuscates what's going on.
Don't blame me that the result is obfuscated.
