As requested, these were just the times for suspending.

Yes, I would think so too. Perhaps the differences would probably
disappear if I made the algorithm more like your original (ie simplifed
eat_memory back to the original), but I do remember lots of disk
activity when using the original code as well - perhaps the cause might
be worth further investigation? (Not that I'm volunteering)

As I've said above, I'm not sure it is right to say it is faster - I
didn't compare your current method with the new one, but rather mine
with parameters making the algorithm as close to yours as possible. My
point was more that if the new method is slower, its not significantly
slower.
Nevertheless, you do have a good point - it is more complicated. But I
think it's worth it and its not a lot more complicated. People who are
using the new method at the moment appreciate the changes. Don't think
for a moment that I don't value your work, Pavel. I couldn't have done
any of my additions without it and consider mine tweaking. This has
simply been a quest to get a more responsive system on resume.

Nigel
