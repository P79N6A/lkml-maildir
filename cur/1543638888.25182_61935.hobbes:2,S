What is the difference between the supported and advertising fields?
What is MII? (as in the SUPPORTED_MII feature?).
If you can't control the # of ints before Tx/Rx, I take it you can just
set those fields to 0?

What do you set the bus_info field to if there is no bus? Where are all
these bus types defined? The header file isn't very clear about anything
other than pci bus types.
I take it you can just set fw_version to zero length string if it is unknown?

Wouldn't it have been better to make this 'n character device which can be
read from / written to just like a normal file (/dev/nvram-like interface) -
that way applications can actually use unused eeprom space.

Wtf is coalescing parameters? These commands aren't even defined in the
2.4.18 kernel headers. Is this 2.5.xx additions?
Same goes for the following commands:
> ETHTOOL_GRINGPARAM
> ETHTOOL_SRINGPARAM
> ETHTOOL_GPAUSEPARAM
> ETHTOOL_SPAUSEPARAM
> ETHTOOL_GRXCSUM
> ETHTOOL_SRXCSUM
> ETHTOOL_GTXCSUM
> ETHTOOL_STXCSUM
> ETHTOOL_GSG
> ETHTOOL_SSG
> ETHTOOL_TEST
> ETHTOOL_GSTRINGS
> ETHTOOL_PHYS_ID
> ETHTOOL_GSTATS
