Bad idea - the right fix to this is to stop using ksoftirqd so readily
under load. If it bales after 20 iterations life is good. As shipped life
is bad.
Once ksoftirq triggers its because we are seriously overloaded (or without
fixing its use slightly randomly). In that case we want other stuff to
do work before we potentially unleash the next flood.

You can already tell the kernel to poll for idle tasks (and since newer intel
CPUS seem to gain nothing from hlt might as well on those)
