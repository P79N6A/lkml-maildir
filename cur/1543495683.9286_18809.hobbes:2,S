Last week or so,  I reported a problem building ksysmoops; basically it
failed in the link, with unresolved
references to:
/usr/local/lib/libbfd.so: undefined reference to `dcgettext__'
/usr/local/lib/libbfd.so: undefined reference to `_nl_msg_cat_cntr'
I've figured out what the probem is.  Basically, the version of libbfd
I'm using is that which got built with
gdb-4.18 (libbfd-2.9.4.so).  As part of the gdb build, libintl.a was
also created, and this contains the missing code.   Unfortunately,
libintl.a isn't installed by default, but when I linked against it, the
problem
vanished and I end up with a working ksymoops.
I'm still using  /lib/libc.so.5.4.46, so maybe the problem would also go
away if I used a more up to date version of the library.
