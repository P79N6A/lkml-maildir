And btw, if you'd have read the whole thread you'd have seen that I argued
against mergign the randomization and address space layout changes into
2.6, and such changes during stable series are bad.  But your still much
better of getting your code fixed properly, and thus pretty much means
havign your own binary format handler in the kernel that sets up the address
space in a windows compatible way.
