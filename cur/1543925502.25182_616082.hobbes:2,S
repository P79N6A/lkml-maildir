I think header files should be complete, and should not use undefined
macros, picking up every random definition that may be in effect when
the header is included, don't you agree? Why not use some other
constant instead of INT_MAX? What improvement does commit
132e4b0a049c39337c535501561b8301c7f2b202 provide? It certainly
breaks existing userspace code.
