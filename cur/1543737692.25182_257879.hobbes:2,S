on Fedora, make install will do the bootloader thing automatically

it can't be an accident; the kernel source that ship in Fedora have a
special "custom" added to the EXTRAVERSION to prevent accidents where
people who are learning and follow a kernel building howto overwrite the
"known good" kernel, but instead things get installed in a parallel dir
with a different EXTRAVERSION.
If Richard overwrote his modules anyway he must have hacked the Makefile
himself to deliberately cause this, at which point... well saw wind
harvest storm ;)
