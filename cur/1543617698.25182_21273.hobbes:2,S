If Linus says september freezes in september and ships for christmas I will
be most suprised. If he says september freezes the may after and ships the
december after that I'd count it normal 
Personally I'd really like to see the block I/O stuff straightened out. The
neccessary VM bits done, device driver updates and a September freeze. I
think it can be done, and I think the resulting kernel will be way way
better for people with 1Gb+ of RAM, so much better that its worth making a
clear release at that point.
