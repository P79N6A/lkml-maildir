Yes of course. :-)

I did have one issue, not sure what it's related to:
My first test was against an SMP compiled kernel running on UP,
as I stated previously.  When re-compiling the kernel, my machine
locked up solid during IDE access.  Unfortunately no magic-keys
were available and I needed to hard-reset and downgrade.
I recompiled for UP, rebooted, and was able to perform multiple
kernel compilations with no hanging.
I didn't perform a stress-test last night, but tonight if i'm able i'll
run some bonnie against it to see if it's stable, if you like.
