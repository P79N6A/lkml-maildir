Subject: new PCI ID in eepro100.c

The new Toshiba tablet PC's (and probably some other devices by now) are
shipping with a new version of the eepro100 onboard ethernet chip. The
only problem is that the PCI ID isn't recognized by Linux (2.4.18,
eepro100.c). I got it working simply by adding the following line to the
PCI device table in eepro100.c:
	{ PCI_VENDOR_ID_INTEL, 0x1059, PCI_ANY_ID, PCI_ANY_ID, },
Would you be kind enough to add this to the official driver if it hasn't
already been done?
Thanks
