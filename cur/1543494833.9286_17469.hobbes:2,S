Subject: [PATCH] tunneling icmp patch
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

It might just be cosmetic but I think if we configure a ip-in-ip
tunnel all icmp packages traversing the tunnel should reach the
tunnel endpoint with "one hop" and not get rejected by a host inbetween
the tunnelendpoints just because ttl reached 0.
