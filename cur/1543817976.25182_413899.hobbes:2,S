I will look into eliminating this as much as possible.

Fixed.

Moved to machine_shutdown().

I have moved above code to machine_shutdown. I would prefer to delay
disabling VHPT as much as possible, but since machine_kexec gets called
soon after machine_shutdown and we should be executing kernel code
strictly at this point which uses pinned TR entries, disabling VHPT
should not have any deleterious effect.
