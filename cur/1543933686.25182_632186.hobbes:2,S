Quite well-educated guess! In fact I had already discovered that
ohci-hcd fails to load, at all. Doh.
(however after going through all recent ohci.*hcd related LKML postings
it seems there's no report about such problems yet)
Sorry for barking up the entirely wrong tree!
For giggles, here's the output:
# modprobe ohci-hcd
FATAL: Error inserting ohci_hcd (/lib/modules/2.6.24-rc6-mm1-gate/kernel/drivers/usb/host/ohci-hcd.ko): No such device
dmesg:
ohci_hcd: 2006 August 04 USB 1.1 'Open' Host Controller (OHCI) Driver
ohci_hcd: block sizes: ed 64 td 64
(yes, that's all there is, despite CONFIG_USB_DEBUG being set)
The LED of a usb stick isn't active either, for obvious reasons.
And keep in mind that this is a (relatively old) OHCI-only machine...
(which had the 2.6.19 lsmod showing ohci-hcd just fine and working fine
with WLAN USB)
Now pondering whether to try -rc6 proper or whether to revert specific
guilty-looking USB changes...
And wondering how to properly elevate this issue (prompt Greg about it,
new thread, bug #, ...?)
Thanks,
Andreas Mohr
