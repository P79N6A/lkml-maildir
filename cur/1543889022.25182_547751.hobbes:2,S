But unless I'm not mistaken, I don't have even the C1 state available. I 
seem to have only C0 according to "active state". "Active state is the sleep 
state currently used when the system is idle", isn't it? Here is the source:
http://acpi.sourceforge.net/documentation/processor.html
But are you saying that with most desktop mobos one doesn't usually have the 
different power states available at all? So basically the only means to 
conserve power is to scale the frequency?
