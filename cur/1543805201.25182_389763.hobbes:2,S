Those are interesting numbers.  That's pretty much the showcase for
sharing, yeah.

I must mention here that I think most DB performance suites do their forks
up front, then never fork during the test, so fork performance doesn't
really factor in as much.  There are other reasons shared page tables helps
there, though.

mmap() randomization doesn't affect fork at all, since by definition all
regions are at the same address in the child as the parent (ie good for
sharing).  The trickier case is where processes independently mmap() a
region.
