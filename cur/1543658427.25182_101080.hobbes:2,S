Luigi,
You forgot one thing.  None of us can control what the end user does.
If a vendor tells the enduser to alter the 2.5/2.6 kernel and recompile.
What are you going to do?
Add a clause where the enduser can not change the source code or apply a
patch to do it for them?
Funny, you lost your rights to do that w/ GPL, as did I.
*sigh*
