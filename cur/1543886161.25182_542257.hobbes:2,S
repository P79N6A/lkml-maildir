Subject: [PATCH] Remove cpu hotplug defines for __INIT & __INITDATA
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Russell and Andrew,
After examining what was checked in and the code base I discovered that most
of 86c0baf123e474b6eb404798926ecf62b426bf3a wasn't necessary anymore....
So here's a patch that reverts the last part of that changeset:
Revert part of 86c0baf123e474b6eb404798926ecf62b426bf3a.
The kernel has moved forward to a state where the original change is not
necessary.  After porting forward, this final version of the patch was
applied and broke non-x86 architectures.
