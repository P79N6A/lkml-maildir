Well, the thing is, returning NULL is probably the most natural thing to 
do for a filesystem that doesn't really _have_ a valid error code for the 
situation. It's more of a "I can't do this" thing, than an error. 
Sure, we can make all filesystems return -ESTALE, but not only is the 
patch fairly big, it really doesn't look at all better or make any more 
sense. ESTALE is really strictly a NFS thing - it doesn't tend to make 
sense for other filesystems (well, sure, other filesystems may have inode 
versions too and decide to use ESTALE for things, so I'm not claiming that 
it's _purely_ a NFS thing, but I think you see my point).
So it really seems to make more sense to just make the ESTALE handling be 
a NFS issue. 
And notice that I'm not arguing that "fh_to_dentr/parent()" should 
_always_ return NULL for errors. There may be real reasons why a 
filesystem might want to return some actual error, like EIO. And maybe a 
filesystem actually wants to return an explicit ESTALE when that makes 
sense (ie when the filesystem _does_ find an inode that matches, but the 
generation doesn't match).
But I'm just looking at your patch, and seeing things like
	        if (fh_len <= 2)
	-               return NULL;
	+               return ERR_PTR(-ESTALE);
and going "That really didn't make the code any prettier or easier to 
understand".
