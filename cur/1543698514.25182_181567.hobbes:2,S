Hmm. There is a backplane involved, that might change things a little.
Quoting the manual:
"A Serial ATA controller is incorporated into the 875P chipset to
provide a two-port Serial ATA subsystem, which is RAID 0 and RAID 1
supported. The Serial ATA drives are hot-swappable units. Note: The
operating system you use must have RAID support to enable the hot-swap
capability and RAID function of the Serial ATA drives."
"The Serial ATA drives plug into a backplane that provides power, drive
ID and bus termination. A RAID controller can be used with the backplane
to provide data security. The operating system you use must have RAID
support to enable the hot-swap capability of the Serial ATA drives."
The wording here is a little confusing, but hot-swap seems to work quite
well with intels windows fakeraid-drivers, at least. One just pushes the
"i'm going to pull you out now"-button on the tray, and pull the drive
tray out. Maybe it triggers an event to the fakeraid-driver, wich then
powers down the bus? black backplane-magic?
Anyways, REAL S-ATA hardware RAID controllers are pretty cheap over here
nowadays..
