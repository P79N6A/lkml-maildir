With newer kernels you should get a panic because we spot the "I'm going
to get 4 bytes stuck in the FIFO and DMA your inodes shifted 4 bytes down the
disk behaviour" - at least in the cases I could study
What set up do you have ?

You actually really to just turn off UDMA from experience.

I would have expected this to be a fix in the core code to ignore
hwif->autodma but I'll admit I've not looked to see if that is practical.
