Wow, this project has been making amazing progress.  They may have a
working device by the end of THIS year, and they seem to have buyers
lining up to throw money at them when the card is ready.  Even if gamer
one does not buy it they appear to have a viable market in the academic
and research communities.  Plus high end content work, simulation, etc.
This is shaping up to be a real open source success story.
