I know Ken Chen had been very keen to minimise work in this area (althogh
I don't know how much help plugging would be to a direct-IO DB2 workload).

I did, but tiobench is either very random or very linear, so it won't
show up as a problem there, I suspect.
But I hope merging shouldn't be harmed too much: we don't hold the
requests plugged for too long, and they end up going out to the queue
for public merging anyway. But I suspect that it is true to say, all
else being equal, delaying the propogation of requests to the queue
will harm merge chances.
Conversely, I suppose there is now less chance that the driver will
dequeue a request that we are likely to merge with (ie. previously
submitted one).

I think it should be OK in terms of missed unplugs, because we never
let the plugged context "escape" into the wider kernel while it is
still holding plugs. But as a debugging/testing aid, that might be
useful so I'll keep it in mind.
The bigger concern I have is some parts of scsi and ide seem to kind
of hijack the unplugging kick for use in some of their error/retry
mechanisms. These are probbly busted now, but they could be moved to
a SCSI/IDE specific timer/workqueue perhaps.
