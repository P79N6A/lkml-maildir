Hi,
I have run a small test in MS-DOS 5.00:
  1) Create a new directory
  2) Create five files in it
  3) Change the first character of the second filename to 0x00 with an editor
  4) Do a DIR listing: only one file is seen
     Linux shows four files!
  5) Create a new file
  6) Do a DIR listing: there are five files
So MS-DOS 5.00 at least does stop when a 0x00 marker is found, but does
not write new 0x00 markers when a 0x00 marker is overwritten. 
Thanks,
  Frodo
