And I appreciate it.  This was mostly an observation there was
something reminding me to get back and fix the issue.

Yes there is a big const correctness type problem here.
First for machine_restart it is 100% correct.  And at least sys_reboot
assumes that machine_restart will not return, even before my patch.
And I don't know of a case where it makes sense for machine_halt and
machine_power_off to return.  Hence I deliberately made those cases
the same.  Especially as every real implementation I traced does not
return.  It is only the stupid cases like on x86 where we don't do
anything that these routines actually return.
In the context of my patch stop_this_cpu needs to be marked noreturn.
As long as the fundamental routines get marked I don't expect to see
a lot of routines getting a while(1);  I admit stop_apics also
needs a while(1); but only because gcc cannot trace it.
And since this also generates warnings on other architectures
it looks like someone (me) needs to go through the various
architectures and add a bunch of noreturn attributes to
the appropriate functions.
The basic question is for documenting and enforcing the noreturn
dependency.  Is it more of a help or a hindrance to use gcc noreturn
tag?
And while I am pretty certain this is the correct thing to do I
should break this out from the reboot_on_bsp patch.  With the
other architectures involved this is enough of a separate issue that a
second set of patches is needed to maintain this cleanly.
