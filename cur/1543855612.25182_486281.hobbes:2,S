Yes, correct.
(Leaving posted writes on has two subtle effects which may or may not be
interesting to you. 1. Write transactions will be performed as unified
transactions. 2. The transaction is already complete before the
controller writes to main memory. There are devices out there which
behave unexpectedly with unified transactions on, and some which do so
if they are off.)

I'm on it, but working slowly, as usual. (I thought I get something
together during your holidays, but I fought with other buggy software
which crippled my main PC...)
