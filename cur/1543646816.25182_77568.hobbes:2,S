Oh, and I totally forgot .. 
The merge from Andrew merged in various VM counter updates, which change 
/proc accounting in ways that make some of the system monitoring stuff 
unhappy. In particular, you'll find "vmstat" dumping core, and "top" has a 
few glitches too.
You can fix all of this by just upgrading to a newer "procps" package. Rik 
maintains a procps-2.0.9 (many of the stats were his) at

I don't think there are ready-made binary packages, but maybe some
enterprising and helpful - and trustworthy - soul can do that and get
vendors to add it to their upgrade list (or at least make it available in
contrib).
