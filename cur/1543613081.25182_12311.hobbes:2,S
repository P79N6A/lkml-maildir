I believe this error comes, not from a (genuine or mistaken) shortage
of free memory, but from shortage or fragmentation of vmalloc's virtual
address space.  Does patch below (to 2.4.17-pre4-aa1 since I think that's
what you tried last; easily adaptible to other trees) doubling vmalloc's
address space (on your 1GB machine or larger) make any difference?
Perhaps there's a vmalloc leak and this will only delay the error.
