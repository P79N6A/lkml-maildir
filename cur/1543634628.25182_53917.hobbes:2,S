Subject: [PATCH 2.5.24] i386 arch subdivision into machine types
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This code rearranges the arch/i386 directory structure to allow for sliding 
additional non-pc hardware in here in an easily separable (and thus easily 
maintainable) fashion.  The idea is that all the code for the particular 
problem hardware should be able to go in a separate directory with only 
additional build options in config.in.
The current patch really only pulls out the visws code from the core and 
places it into a separate directory (sort of a simple example case).  It also 
creates a generic directory (for standard x86 PCs) with all of the hooks 
documented.
The current patch moves mpparse.c back into arch/i386/kernel with it's own 
subordinate config option and upports to 2.5.24.
