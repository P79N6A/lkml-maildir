Hi Dave,
I just tested your descriptors.diff, and here are the results:
(make dep clean bzImage modules modules_install, all same tree of course)
2.4.20-rc2:
real  5m27.670s   user  5m6.450s   sys  0m18.710s
real  5m27.590s   user  5m6.760s   sys  0m18.660s
real  5m27.953s   user  5m6.900s   sys  0m18.310s
2.4.20-rc2 with descriptors.diff:
real  5m29.005s   user  5m8.540s   sys  0m18.610s
real  5m27.752s   user  5m8.760s   sys  0m17.870s
real  5m29.021s   user  5m8.210s   sys  0m18.540s
Doesn't really look more than cosmetic, does it?
/proc output is correct with your diff.
Regards,
Stephan
