Hmm, but that's not a problem specific to the SuSE versions, is it?
Joerg was claiming that SuSE release "defective" versions that impact his
reputation. And I can't see that, because the versions shipped with at least
7.3, 9.0 and 9.1 just work fine (that's the versions I used).
The security thing and the problems with 2.6.8.1 keeping users from burning
(I have my set patched in now to allow users burning again, nor sure if
it is safe...) is a general issue as far as I understand, and nothing
SuSE specific.
Please correct me if I'm wrong!
cu,
Frank
