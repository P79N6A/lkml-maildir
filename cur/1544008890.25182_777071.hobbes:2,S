Consider the case where a subsystem that consumes engines like
async_tx or net_dma loads before engines are available in the system.
They will have taken a reference against dmaengine, but calls to
dma_find_channel will return NULL.  Once a channel driver is loaded
dma_find_channel() can start returning results, and it is at this
point that resources must be allocated and the backing module pinned.
So dmaengine_get() means "I am interested in offloading stuff, if you
see an offload resource grab it and prep it so I can discover it with
dma_find_channel()".

The assumption is that mem-to-mem offload clients poll dma_find_channel().
