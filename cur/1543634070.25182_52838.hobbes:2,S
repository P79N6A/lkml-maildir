For the curious, the reason is that modprobe writes even failed attempts
to a log in /var/log/ksymoops, and calls fdatasync() on that file
afterwards.  There is no way to disable this without removing that
directory, as a design decision.  I don't personally see the point in
logging attempts which fail because there is no driver...
