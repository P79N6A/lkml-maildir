Hmmmm... Okay that needs to be addressed. Reserves need to be used and we 
only should enter reclaim if that runs out (like the first patch that I 
did).

I want general improvements to reclaim to address the issues that you see 
and other issues related to reclaim instead of the strange code that makes 
PF_MEMALLOC allocs compete for allocations from a single slab and putting 
logic into the kernel to decide which allocs to fail. We can reclaim after 
all. Its just a matter of finding the right way to do this.

No one is trying to abolish Anonymous pages. Free memory is readily 
available on demand if one calls reclaim. Your scheme introduces complex 
negotiations over a few scraps of memory when large amounts of memory 
would still be readily available if one would do the right thing and call 
into reclaim.

Sounds like you would like to change the way we handle memory in general 
in the VM? Reclaim (and thus finding freeable pages) is basic to Linux 
memory management.

Sorry I just got into this a short time ago and I may need a few cycles 
to get this all straight. An approach that uses memory instead of 
ignoring available memory is certainly better.
