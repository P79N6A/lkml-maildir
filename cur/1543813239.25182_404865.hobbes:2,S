While investigating two (incorrect) errors of the Coverity checker, I 
found the following in drivers/ieee1394/ohci1394.c:ohci1394_pci_remove():
                /* Free IR dma */
                free_dma_rcv_ctx(&ohci->ir_legacy_context);
                /* Free IT dma */
                free_dma_trm_ctx(&ohci->it_legacy_context);
                /* Free IR legacy dma */
                free_dma_rcv_ctx(&ohci->ir_legacy_context);
Both functions contain:
<--  snip  -->
static void free_dma_rcv_ctx(struct dma_rcv_ctx *d)
{
        int i;
        struct ti_ohci *ohci = d->ohci;
        if (ohci == NULL)
                return;
...
        /* Mark this context as freed. */
        d->ohci = NULL;
}
<--  snip  -->
There are no other return possibilities in these functions.
Therefore, the latter two of the three function calls above aren't doing 
anything.
