I guess I'm not clear on what behavior is desired for scatter/gather if 
one of the segments in an iov fails.
If one of the iov's will cause an EFAULT, how is that reported back to 
the application, and what happens to the I/O being requested in the 
other segments of the vector?  When do we use an "all or nothing" 
semantic, and when is it OK for some segments to fail?
