The sysinfo interface produces strange effects anyway - you can't tell
if a particular field is valid or not without using a lookup table
from kernel version numbers to fields.
A version number, a set of flags or some other indicator could be
added to the structure so applications tell what values the system
filed in. (The caller would have to initialise the version to 0 to
detect the current interface.)
