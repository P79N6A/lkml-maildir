we'd be breaking userspace API, but not ABI ... and the largest consumers out 
there (glibc/uclibc) have not been accounting for this, so we wouldnt be 
breaking them
that's how we noticed the issue in Gentoo ... all the epoll calls are 
automatically declared -ENOSYS stubs in glibc's libc.so
is there some other large consumer i'm not thinking of ?

in the end, either works for me ... i can see linux's pretty hard 'dont break 
userspace' policy coming into play here
