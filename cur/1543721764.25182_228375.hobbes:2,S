Nobody moved to silence you.  What he asked was:
"In light of the fact that you started flaming SuSE regarding their behavior,
when it turned out to be a *documented* way that SuSE does things (see the
README.SUSE file, point (3)), please explain why *we* should bother listening
to you, rather than just adding you to whatever style of killfile is supported
by our mail reading software?"
I may be an idiot kernel hacker, but I don't *demand* that anybody listen to
me.  I *hope* that when I post, somebody with clue thinks I'm worth listening
to.  Some of my patches get accepted, some get ignored, some get feedback. I
suspect that's in large degree correlated to how correct/stupid the patch is. ;)
But the only people in the Linux world that *have* to listen to me are the
customer support staff at those vendors that I've purchased a support contract.
