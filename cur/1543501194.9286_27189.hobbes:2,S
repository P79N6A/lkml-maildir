Hi,

That's not _necessarily_ true.  You could as easily say that:
any time something like 
	the internet
	the http protocols
	xml encoding
	ELF binary formats
	the coda distributed filesystem
comes along, it is because our local disk filesystem has failed.
I'm not trying to argue against solving problems.  I'm trying to argue
for solving them in the right place.
You say we need filesystem support for GUIs.  But when I point out that
I _need_ my home directory to run over NFS, I'm just a stick-in-the-mud?
Hans, with 95% of the Linux developers I deal with, I can point out
problems and engage in a constructive argument about how to solve them.

That's part of the problem.  If you continue to dismiss existing
practice out-of-hand, then it is your new features which I won't use.

This is exactly the attitude which is the problem.  NFS is _not_ broken:
you are  just claiming that anything which isn't your solution is
broken.  That's hardly constructive.
Now, what we _could_ do is to provide a user-space library stub for
other NFS clients which translates O_DIRECTORY() opens to a file into an
open of something like "filename/.%%pseudodir%%", and have an NFS server
which detects that pseudoname and munges it into an O_DIRECTORY open on
the server side.  
See?  Suddenly we are able to pass these calls over NFS while still
doing something useful with local filesystem semantics.  That's the sort
of thing I would like to see us talking about.  Simply dismissing all of
existing practice as irrelevant and broken just doesn't get us any
further, I'm afraid.

You keep harping on the benefit of change without appearing ever to
address questions about where the change is best applied.  That is a
serious problem.  The cost of making the wrong change is that you just
won't persuade people to follow.  I hear too much from you that sounds
like "we can solve it in the filesystem, therefore it is broken to solve
it anywhere else".  I just don't buy that argument.
