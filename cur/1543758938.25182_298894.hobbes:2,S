Actually, we are:
Red Hat Linux 7.2:            not magical
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1:     magical
Red Hat Linux 7.3:            not magical
Red Hat Linux 8.0:            not magical
Red Hat Linux 9:              not magical
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3.0:     magical
Fedora Core 1:                not magical
Fedora Core 2:                not magical
Fedora Core 3:                not magical
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.0:     magical
Fedora Core 4:                not magical
...
Sure, Red Hat changes the name as well as the version number whenever they
make a magical release, but it's really the same concept.
