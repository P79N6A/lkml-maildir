Yes, we had that patch in the RH 2.4 kernel, but it didn't detect the
stack overflow we spent days to track.  Our problem was just one of
a really deep stack: RPC-to-network-filesystem-on-ext3-with-htree.
This overflowed the 8kB stack even without an interrupt happening.
We fixed the htree and the network filesystem stack usage, but if we
added LVM/EVMS into the mix (which we would have in production) and
threw in a piggy interrupt handler we would possibly again overflow
an 8kB stack, so having a per-entry/exit stack checker would be great.
Cheers, Andreas
