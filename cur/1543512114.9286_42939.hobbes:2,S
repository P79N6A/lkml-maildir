Doing flushpage is good thing. But there's another posibility of data
corruption.
You have a directory and change something in it - there are dirty hashed
buffers covering directory. 
You erase that directory - as there is no bforget, there are still dirty
hashed buffers.
You alloc file at that place. Buffers containing former directory are
flushed over the file.
I think bforget must be called always when you release some structure that
was accessed using bread/brelse.
