The units of the value, worst, and threshold fields are not important
- it's all relative.
Yes, the raw value field is usually the temperature in C as measured
by an on-board sensor, but as far as I know, there is no _requirement_
for it to be.  I've seen disks which report the power on hours in
minutes, for example.
I think the raw value field is really provided for extra-information
purposes - it's better to use the value, worst and threshold fields.
Basically, as long as the value field doesn't reach the threshold
field, don't worry about that aspect of the drive.  Note, the value
may count up or down.  The worst field may or may not be preserved
over a power cycle, that is drive dependant.
John.
