Is it allowed? I think Phil Katz had some claim to this since
he created the compression method by combining several published
algorithms. Don't hit me with fire, I was involved in the PK/ARC
Lawsuit. I am distinctly aware of his work.
The RedHat bzip2 Web Page seems to say that it's all "Free Software".
I suppose, upon the death of an author, everything's up for grabs.
At the very least, if you use this method, I suggest you name the
output file pkImage.
Cheers,
