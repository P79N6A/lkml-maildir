Hi,
It seems that the waitid-system-call.patch in
2.6.9-rc1-mm1 introduced a circular include dependency
problem in the ppc arch.
The problem seems to be related to the addition of the
linux/resource.h header file in
include/asm-generic/siginfo.h for the new _rusage
field.
  CC      arch/ppc/kernel/asm-offsets.s
In file included from include/linux/mm.h:4,
                 from include/asm/io.h:7,

Using gcc 3.3.2.
2.6.9-rc1, which does not include that patch, builds
fine for me.
Any others saw this?
Cheers,
Albert
