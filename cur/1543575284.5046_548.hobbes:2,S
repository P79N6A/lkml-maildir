Hi,
I have an IBM drive, DTLA-307075 (75GB), and a bios that hangs with
large disks. I use a jumper to clip it to 32GB size, so the bios can
boot into linux. The problem is that WIN_READ_NATIVE_MAX returns 32GB,
and not the true size, and even trying to set the correct size with
WIN_SET_MAX fails. Is there a way to use this combination (Bios, HD,
Linux)?
