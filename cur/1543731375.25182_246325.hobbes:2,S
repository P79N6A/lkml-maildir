Hello;
I have done a summary of some aio-stress runs on our 1CPU and 2CPU hosts
to compare the performance of the latest version of Suparna's buffered AIO
patch set http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-aio&m=109285137710061&w=2
(less the aio-ra) to the linux-2.6.8 kernel.  I found up to a 442%
improvement and was wondering if anyone could explain it.
The buffered results on 1CPU/single disk/512M RAM/1 2G File showed:
     Sequential Reads:    -13.2%
     Random reads:        +32.7%
The buffered results on 2CPU/5 Disk striped Megaraid/1G RAM/1 4G File
showed:
    Sequential reads:      +2.1%
    Random Reads:         +442%
The improvement in buffered random reads from this patch set was +32% on
1CPU and +442% on 2CPU.  This was more than expected on the 2CPU host at
+442%.  It seems as though the 'buffered random reads' performance on the
unpatched linux-2.6.8 kernel is unexpectedly low at only 7.57MB/s on our
5 Disk striped Megaraid partition.
The buffered sequential reads on the 1CPU host were 13% slower, but they
did not change significantly on the 2CPU host.
There were no other serious regressions or changes within error.
