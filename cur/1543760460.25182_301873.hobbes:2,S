Direct use of /dev/random always makes me nervous.  I've had a recurring 
problem with /dev/random blocking, and generally configure as much as 
possible to use /dev/urandom instead.  It's really easy for a normal user to 
drain the /dev/random entropy pool on a server (at least one that doesn't 
have a sound card you can tell it to read white noise from).  cat /dev/random 
> /dev/null
I like /dev/urandom because it'll feed you as much entropy as it's got, but 
won't block, and will presumably round-robin insert real entropy in the 
streams that multiple users get from /dev/urandom.  (I realize this may not 
be the best place to get gpg keys from.)
I'm just thinking about those UML hosting farms, with several UML instances 
per machine, on machines which haven't got a keyboard attached constantly 
feeding entropy into the pool.  If just ONE of them is serving ssl 
connections from its own /dev/urandom, that would drain the /dev/random 
entropy pool on the host machine almost immediately...
Admittedly if UML used /dev/urandom instead of /dev/random, it wouldn't know 
how much "real" randomness it was getting and how much synthetic randomness, 
but this makes predicting the numbers it's producing easier how?
