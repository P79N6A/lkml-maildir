Why? That just doesn't make sense. Why should I have KMOD turned on to
eg. use a joystick? I know, it can make some things easier, but that's a
matter of personal preference. If I don't want KMOD, I just insmod
joystick.o, and it will get char major 15, because it requests it. Why
it should need KMOD?
