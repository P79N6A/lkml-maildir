This patch might cause usb_free_urb() to fail if not all the URBs have been
allocated successfully: in this case, the original loop stops as soon as 
cam->urb[i] == NULL (where NULL is given from the failed allocation),
while in the second loop there might be a not null cam->urb[i+n]
pointing to an URB that has already been deallocated elsewhere.
The same bug is present in PATCH 12/33.
Best regards,
