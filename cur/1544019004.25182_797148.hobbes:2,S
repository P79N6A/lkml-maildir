Not sure I understand.
arch/x86/kernel/cpu/mcheck/mce_amd_64.c:store_interrupt_enable() can
race with cpu_down(), but at worst work_on_cpu() returns -EINVAL.
However, after the 1/3 patch we can hang forever.
Yes, afaics the code was not correct before it was converted to use
work_on_cpu(). But now it becomes wrong again?
