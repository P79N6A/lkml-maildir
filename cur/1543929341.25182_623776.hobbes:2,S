It sounds like you mean that you know the controller did NOT raise the 
interrupt ( intentionally/correctly ) if there was no command in 
progress, as opposed to not being able to tell.  Unless there is some 
condition under which it is valid for the controller to raise an 
interrupt when it had no commands in progress?  And if that's the case 
and there's know way to know WHY, that's a broken design.
