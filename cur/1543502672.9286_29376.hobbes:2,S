Sorry about the massive CC, but....
I'm running a K6-2 350 with the FIC PA-2013 (ATX version of
the 503+) with no problems with tar. I'll try a massive
tar/untar torture test this evening and see what comes out.
I'm not running UDMA b/c of the reports of possible problems
with the MVP3 and UDMA between hard drives on the same
channel. Turned it off back when I was having problems with
random bizarre errors on my second drive; turns out the
problem was a loose power connector. Works fine now, but
haven't turned UDMA back on.
