Nice work Stefan, the skb rewrite was one of the most pointless
rewrites in the history of the linux1394 stack.

Yup, mandatory running in process context is braindead, since most
complete routines just need to complete a completion or schedule some
work.

Not sure if this is worth it, kmalloc is pretty fast these days.
Hehe, you're reverting the bad decisions that made me tune out from
linux1394 development a few years back.  But the question is, is it
worth it?  One of the primary reasons for me to write an alternative
stack was to be able to leave linux1394 in maintenence mode.  This way
I wont screw up existing functionality in the old stack, and will be
able to make big changes without worrying about porting over every
single driver.
