I just found a workaround of my problem, if system boots with ac adapter 
plugged then ondemand or conservative governors are not working, but 
unplugging the adapter and waiting some seconds, plug it back solves this 
issue and ondemand/conservative governors are starts to run as expected.
What should i do now? If im not wrong it seems like acpi subsystem problem 
(and just to be sure, i disassembled my dsdt, iacl claims its error/warning 
free)
