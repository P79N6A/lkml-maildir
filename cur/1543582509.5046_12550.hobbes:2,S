Hi
if i have a valid tap0 device i should be able to
read write to /dev/netlink/tap0 but for some reson
only as root should it be like this ?
eg i would think that is the file permissions are like
crw-rw-rw-  /dev/netlink/tap0
anyone should be able to open it.
is it meant to be like this if it is it seems very misleading
from what i can tell it calls
ethertap_open then it calls
etlink_kernel_create then it calls
sock_create where i think it is failing because it does not
have CAP_NET_RAW
thanks
	James
