The odd thing about this is that the highmem addresses shouldn't have a
virtual mapping (since nothing should have called kmap on them).
But the other tickles a suspicion about the card.  I know various LSI
chips that don't have a true 64 bit mode, but instead have programmable
windowed mappings in their descriptors  (i.e. all SG list elements have
to be in the same xGB region of physical memory), and since the last
descriptor is more than 4GB away from the other three, whether this
might be the problem here.  Unfortunately, only LSI can tell us this ...
