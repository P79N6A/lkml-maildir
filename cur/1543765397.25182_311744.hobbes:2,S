The problem is that after an resume the running system has access to the
swap, because the key is recoverd. And the left over hybernation data in the
swap can be read by the running kernel because the swap key is restored.
This is not an attack against a notebook in hybernaion, but an attack
against a running system with non-wiped bybernation leftovers - not critical
to me but an possible point of interest.
