We would be glad to do be more clean on these issues. Its difficult 
to see how that can happen when the discussion is blocked on 
principle. I have discussed various scenarios in long discussion 
threads with Andi. The answer "My code is simple and cannot be changed" 
wont get us anywhere.

I wish I knew how we can improve the communication. I have discussed this 
for two months now and tried to respond to every objection and concern 
that came up.

Could we just do the numa_maps in the right way now and do a code cleanup 
for 2.6.14 (node_maps, user interface / system interface separation)? We can 
then think longer term about how the memory of a process can be managed.
