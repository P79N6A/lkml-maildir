Actually, IMHO, many folks could benefit from this discussion.  So, I'm
taking the liberty of posting to the kernel list.

Hi Keith,
You must rebuild the kernel with serial console support - in _addition_ to
the usual VGA + console on virtual terminal.  Then, take a look at:
linux/Documentation/serial-console.txt 
for the gory details.  I added the following line to the 2.2.9-ac2
lilo.conf stanza:
append="console=ttyS1,9600 console=tty0"
Make sure your /dev/console device is major-5, minor-1!  Mine was not.
Before rebooting, delete any existing /etc/ioctl.save file.
Then the system restarts, kernel messages will appear on both the VGA
console and the serial port.  I connected the offending box, via a
null-modem adapter, to a second machine running minicom in text capture
mode.  This works like a champ - capturing the entire oops, which may then
be run through ksymoops for decoding.
Hope this helps.
Steve
