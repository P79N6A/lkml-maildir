I thought we agreed it wasn't needed for the kdump case? Or rather
the only way to fix kdump was to reserve or better not use GART. Just disabling
it is not enough because it could be eventually reenabled and any
in flight DMAs could hit innocent memory.
For kexec it would be sufficient to do it in a platform device hook.
Also I'm a little uneasy in doing PCI access that late in reboot.
While there is luckily no bridge involved here it is still risky
after possibly other PCI hardware has been disabled.
So my suggestion would be: 
(1) implement sysfs platform device based shutdown hooks (preferable
before PCI shutdown) 
(2) make sure GART is never enabled in kernels that are all < 4GB (as 
in the kdump kernel). But what to do about AGP?
