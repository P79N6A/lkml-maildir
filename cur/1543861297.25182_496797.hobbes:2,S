Subject: what means "init_hrtimer_#CLOCKTYPE()"?

  in include/linux/hrtimer.h, we read:
  * The hrtimer structure must be initialized by init_hrtimer_#CLOCKTYPE()
what means that last part, "init_hrtimer_#CLOCKTYPE()"?  i'm not aware
of any such routine.  i'm aware only of init_hrtimers_cpu().

p.s.  besides, that "#" messes up the kernel-doc processing, anyway.
