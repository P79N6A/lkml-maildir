hdparm -i and -I ultimately both interpret WIN_IDENTIFY result, and both test
bit 0x0020 of word 85. So it's unclear to me why they report a
different write cache setting. I added a hexdump to dump_identity()
in hdparm.c, and found that bit 0x0020 of word 85 is always set.
BTW, 'cat /proc/ide/hda/identify' or 'hdparm -Istdin </dev/ide/hda/identify'
reports the same value as hdparm -I, and that is consistent with
the value I set with hdparm -W x.
So, is HDIO_GET_IDENTITY broken?
