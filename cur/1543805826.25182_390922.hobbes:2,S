On the other hand, if X were reniced it would be possible to make the 
interactive bonus mechanism more strict on what it considers to be 
interactive.  As I see it the main reason that non interactive sleeps 
get any consideration at all in determining whether a task is 
interactive is to make sure that X is classified interactive.
One of the things that I've noticed about the X server (with 
instrumented systems) is the its proportion of interruptible sleeps to 
total sleeps goes down when it becomes CPU intensive.  This is because 
the high CPU usage is usually related to screen updates (e.g. try "ls -R 
/" in an xterm or similar) and not keyboard or mouse input.  This means 
that during these periods the X server would lose most of its 
interactive bonus and just rely on its niceness allowing genuine 
interactive tasks to pip it (provided that X's nice value is 
sufficiently small e.g. 5).
Of course, for this to work all of the instances where interruptible 
sleeps aren't interactive would need to be labelled TASK_NONINTERACTIVE 
which would be a big job.
Anyway just my 2c worth.
