Subject: 2.2.1-ac3 Oops with many fds

I was trying to test/use the many file descriptor support, and have a
couple questions and an oops.
I'm raising the system limits as follows:
  echo 131072 > /proc/sys/fs/file-max && echo 131072 >
/proc/sys/fs/inode-max
Is this right?
How high can I go?
Does it matter when it gets raised?
Can I lower it again?
Are there docs about how to use the the > 1024 support?  I wasn't able
to find anything relevant to 2.2.x or 2.1.1xx.
Will an oops go out over serial console?  That could save a lot of error
prone copying....
I think the oops is repeatable under load (it happened before, but I was
in X Windows and didn't see it).  In fact, I can crash the system faster
than I can write this message....
I'm not on linux-kernel.  Please reply directly.
Thanks,

I was testing a 2.2.1-ac3 kernel with the system file-max and inode-max
turn up to 128K.
The system was under heavy load (net, cpu, and disk), and at least one
(threaded) process had over 4K file descriptors in use.  The system
wasn't swapping.
The system is a single PPro 200Mhz, 128Mb, TLAN ethernet (10baseT),
AIC-7xxx SCSI (ultra wide), two disks.
I raise the system limit while things were running.  This seems like
quite a bad idea in hindsite :-{.  It did run for a many seconds past
that.  vmstat seemed hosed before the oops (claim  0  0 0 processes even
though the system was working hard).
Here is the oops:

There was an interesting syslog line many seconds before the oops:
