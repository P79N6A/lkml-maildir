Right.
That said, I think the right thing to do would be to add just one line
'freezer_flags = 0' to dup_task_struct() directly in this patch and then
move all of the random stuff (including this line) to the helper in a separate
patch.
I mean, the introduction of the helper seems to be logically unrelated to the
other things this patch does, so it should go in another patch IMHO.
