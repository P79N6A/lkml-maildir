Will do.
So I give a new question.  Any issue with adding a rx & tx completion  
to spi_bitbang?  In my HW I get an interrupt when the transmitter is  
done transmitting and one when the receiver is done receiving.  I  
need some way to synchronize and wait for both events to occur before  
continuing on in txrx_word().
