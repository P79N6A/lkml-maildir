Well, it can happen only with fileystems with blocksize < pagesize.
So, that should limit the scope :)

I was wondering, is it *okay* to have a dirty buffer but not mapped to
disk ? I guess, so ..

Yeah. I considered doing it in ll_rw_block() - but then I thought
fixing it in set_page_buffer_dirty() may be a valid fix :(
Let me try other options, then.
