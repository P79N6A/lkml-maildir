I just did a 10 second run, average was about 2000/sec, with a minimum
of around 1500/sec and a peak of 3700/sec.
With the rest of the system the same (same programs running, etc) but on
a page that doesn't use that particular plugin, the context switch rate
sits around 250/sec.
Would you like the actual full output from vmstat?
