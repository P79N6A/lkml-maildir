My interpretation may be off, but imo I can enforce the GPL as long as
the violating company uses my code as part of their product. Basicaly,
almost anyone on this list can enforce violations against the kernel,
depending on what code has been included.
People may rip out the IDE code because they don't want Andre Hedrick
to have this opertunity, while ripping out all of Linus code should be
a lot harder. But in principle, everyone is equal.

Personally, I don't like these copyright assignment procedures. Before
signing any of them, I have to carefully read and reread them, not
missing the hidden legal implications. Why go through that mess, if
nothing forces us.
Am I wrong? Don't know.
