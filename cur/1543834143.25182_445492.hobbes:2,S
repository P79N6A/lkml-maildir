I would not try running xfs_repair without cause as well. My /home did
survive the XFS problems but I ran xfs_repair "just to be sure". Now the 
same problem on that partition, mostly unreadable. :( So, do not run 
xfs_repair without a cause ;-)
For reference, I think it was xfsprogs 2.7.14 that I was using, the 
latest in Debian.
FYI: Nothing important on /home, I think - I can not be sure since I
backup only selectively since I do not have proper backup mediums :(
