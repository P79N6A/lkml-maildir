We should avoid needless growth of heavily-used structure such as
inode for a small system like embedded system.
So I make it possible to configure the size of i_blocks with CONFIG_LSF.

glibc's st_blocks is always 8 bytes as below.
__blkcnt64_t st_blocks;
On the original kernel, a padding for st_blocks is set at appropriate
location for each endian types as below.
So, there is no need to fix user program(glibc).
include/asm-i386/stat.h:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
unsigned long   st_blocks;      /* Number 512-byte blocks allocated. */
unsigned long   __pad4;         /* future possible st_blocks high bits */
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
include/asm-m68k/stat.h:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
unsigned long   __pad4;         /* future possible st_blocks high bits */
unsigned long   st_blocks;      /* Number 512-byte blocks allocated. */
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
