Subject: [PATCH 0/3] EDAC: Fixes and new features for EDAC CORE
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/12/13/353

The following 3 patches consist of 1 fix in the E752x driver and 2 new
features. 
The new features are:
1) New EDAC interface for programming memory scrub rates in
memory controller drivers that choose to implement the 
scrubrate function
2) Support in the EDAC CORE for Fully Buffered DIMMs (FB-DIMMs)
A MC driver for the Intel 5000X/V/P chipset is forthcoming, which
requires these EDAC CORE API additions.
