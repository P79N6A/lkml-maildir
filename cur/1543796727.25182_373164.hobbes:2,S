An hint can hardly defined as a "legal decision".
An hint _only_ means "be careful you _might_ be illegal".
"might be" is hardly a "legal deicision", infact it's not decision at
all.
It's like a "you should check your stuff to be sure you're ok".
This is the way I understood it at least...

The way I understood it, is that you may be breaking the GPL even if you
don't circumvent any _GPL tag. You've to check your stuff yourself, and
if you have troubles because of a _GPL tag, it means you must check it
even more closely because you got an explicit _warning_. A warning isn't
a "legal deicsion", it's just a warning.

agreed.

Could be, but then those developers would be wrong. We're not required
to make a symbol as _GPL to make the module illegal. So we should be
reasonable.

I don't think there is one, and there needs to be no one, because the
_GPL tag is not a legal decision, is an hint given from programmers to
lawyers. Programmers may be totally wrong, but we do our best to help on
the legal side too.

This question I don't want to answer because I'm a programmer, this
requires a lawyer because this is the real _legal_decision_: what is a
derived work of the kernel is the only thing that  decides what is legal
and illegal.

;) Of course I meant it makes perfect sense that it's _only_ an "hint".
