I think the problem is that the ACPI code ordering here is broken in a
difficult to fix way.
Definitely, we shouldn't execute the _BFS method after creating the image
and most probably _WAK shouldn't be executed here either.  Moreover,
acpi_leave_sleep_state() enables the runtime GPEs, which AFAICS
is equivalent to allowing ACPI to generate SCIs.  I'm not sure if this is a
good idea to do such a thing in this particular place.
Andrew, could you please apply the appended patch and see if that
helps (should apply to -mm2)?
Rafael

NOTE: This is not a complete solution, because it removes the enabling of GPEs
from the resume-during-hibernation code path entirely, which probbably is not a
good idea in general.
