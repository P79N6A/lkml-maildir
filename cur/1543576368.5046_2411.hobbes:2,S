Hello,
I'm using the emu10k1 module with my SB Live. This works quite fine, but
I cannot switch the recording channel. This worked with 2.2.17. Now
volume works, but selecting the input channel not anymore.
is anyone else experiencing this problem , or don't i just get the right
setting?
second, i habe 2 nics in my K6-2 system, both with rtl8139 chip and
compiled 8139oo into the kernel. the cards work fine, but dmesg says:
eth0: Abnormal interrupt, status 00002002
and
eth0: Abnormal interrupt, status 00000020
endless times. Usually about 2-3 entries per minute.
The cards work fine, so how can I get rid of the message, other then
uncommenting the line in the source code? This also happens if I compile
the driver as module. And happened sind 2.4.0-test12 (the first 2.4.0er
I installed).
This is my first post on this list. If you need additional information,
I'd like to provide it.
So far,
Jan
