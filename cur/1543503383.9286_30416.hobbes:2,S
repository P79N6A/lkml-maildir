Hello,
Whenever I want to compile the kernel 2.3.10-Arthur, I get the message
"error: struct bmap not exist".
I use the Red Hat 6.0 edition with unmodified packages pgcc and gcc.
I had used the kernel-2.3.6 package, the patches to 2.3.7, 2.3.8, 2.3.9 and
2.3.10.
The same error.
I had deleted the kernel-sources and used the kernel-2.3.6 package, patches
to 2.3.7, 2.3.8, 2.3.9 and finally 2.3.10-Arthur, but I`ve received again
the error described above.
I don`t know how to manage to avoid this error/bug.
I`ve added my config-file as attachment.
