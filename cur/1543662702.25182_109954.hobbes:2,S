With 30 odds processes, it doesn't take a whole lot for one process to
have its share of requests eaten.

It's not a vm problem. But it is a problem if kswapd + pdflush can
consume the entire request pool, stalling real user processes.
Mike, please retry the test with more requests available. CFQ does not
rely on request queue length for fairness. Just changes:
	 (queue_nr_requests > 128)
		queue_nr_requests = 128;
to
	 (queue_nr_requests > 512)
		queue_nr_requests = 512;
in ll_rw_blk.c:blk_dev_init() and see how that runs.
