But it's not just "for debug"!  It is for system administrators,
end-users, developers.

Indeed, there will be some non-zero execution-time cost.  We must be
willing to pay *something* in order to enable this functionality.  One
question (still: 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/2/22/166
) is trading
time/space cost; others include cross-platform vs. porting necessity;
robustness w.r.t. data-collectionand control-flow preservation.
