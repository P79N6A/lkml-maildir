I am having the same problem described here and have a bit of information to
add...  I also am using a SuperMicro motherboard (mine is the dual-processor
P6DLF) with a single P2-266 processor.  I have tried building with SMP both
in and out, and this does not make a difference.
The "controller jammed (0xFF)." message from pc_keyb.c started showing up in
2.3.30 (2.3.29 worked fine), but pc_keyb.c wasn't patched significantly
until 2.3.33.  This however, is insignificant, because the patches in that
file have no effect on this condition.
My current guess is that it has something to do with the keyboard spinlock,
IRQ handling, or semaphore changes that occurred in 2.3.30.  I'll report
anything new that I come up with, but we could certainly use some help on
this one.  It must have something to do with this family of motherboards,
but I assumed that PC I/O and IRQ handling from one PC motherboard to the
next would be fairly consistent!
