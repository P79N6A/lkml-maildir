SIGTERM is a bad choise. Right now, init ignores SIGTERM. For
good reason; on some (many?) systems, the shutdown scripts
include "kill -15 -1; sleep 2; kill -9 -1". The "-1" means
"all processes except me". That means init will get hit with
SIGTERM occasionally during shutdown, and that might cause
weird things to happen.
Perhaps SIGUSR1 ?
Mike.
