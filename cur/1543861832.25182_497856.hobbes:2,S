Thanks.
It was 'udev rules' that were messing things up, left over from using 
the disk on a different
piece of hardware. To date I've been making only 'embedded'  systems 
using busybox, and other
similarly limited root environments and never really dealt with a  
pretty much full up distribution
outside of my host development systems. Hence, never really had gotten 
in to 'udev'. I've been
using devfs mostly till recently... However, in anticipation of large 
capacity flash systems, I've moved
to making my embedded systems almost as full up as most host systems.
Is there some startup command line option for the linux kernel to force 
the 'udev' management
program to basically 'ignore and refresh' device names?
