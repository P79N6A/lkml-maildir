Subject: [PATCH 7/9] USB: cxacru: ignore error trying to start ADSL in atm_start
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

From: Simon Arlott <simon@fire.lp0.eu>
The sysfs adsl_status attribute ignores (aside from returning -EIO to the
user) any error sending a START/STOP command to the device and there is at
least one firmware which never sends a response but appears to work
regardless.  Therefore atm_start should also continue if an error is received
so that such firmware is usable.
The official Conexant driver doesn't expect a reply either but this is for
another device (E2 router) and a commonly used firmware does respond.
Also, there is no point in changing -ECONNRESET to -ETIMEDOUT since nothing
ever checks for either of these values.
