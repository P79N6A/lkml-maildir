Definitely.  Unfortunately, this problem has seemingly existed since day
one and not once has anybody been able to draw any conclusions based their
findings.

I am not convinced that is true.  This board was brought to market
strictly for the hobbyist and I'm sure that ABit tested with 100MHz FSB.

I would be first in line to buy a motherboard that is fully tested and
QA'd before being released.  The initial BP6 should never have been
released with it's terribly broken BIOS.
