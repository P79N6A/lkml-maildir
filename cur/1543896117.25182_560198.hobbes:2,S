In this case, yes.
It's because two independent ACPI drivers are set up here.
If you could put these together, only set up
acpi_bus_register_driver(..) once in .init and get the pic and nc driver
handled together it would work.
I don't know whether this could be done.
If not, IMO this driver should get split up in two separate drivers, one
serving SONY_PIC_HID and one serving SONY_NC_HID.

Sounds sane.
Another problem that could come up in future is that new laptops could
make use of the ACPI video spec (Appendix B) and of these vendor
specific devices (I already saw this on an ASUS).
While autoloading should still be ok (both are tried, maybe even both
are needed), we need to find out which one need to be used in which
condition.
I could imagine if we pass some kind of "Vista" OSI string, the ACPI
video spec stuff is used otherwise e.g. the ATK Asus specific things...
It might even be mixed up, that some functions of the video device
driver are provided, but hotkeys are still working with the other
driver...
I fear getting this right for all kind of laptops won't be that easy.

BTW: I also saw a laptop (IIRC it was a sony) with asus and sony ACPI
device.
When both drivers got loaded things broke.
A solution was to only let the asus driver get active if the device is
known. Currently, not sure whether still (I sent a patch a while ago),
the Asus driver falls back to a default ("M6N"?) configuration. IMO this
is a bit too dangerous and instead a message like "unsupported ASUS
model found, please send acpidump to linux-acpi@vger.kernel.org".
