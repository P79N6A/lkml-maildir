Yes, it did come up but never went anywhere; the sticking point at the
time was the perception that debugfs is only for kernel debugging and
therefore wouldn't be configured into most kernels (whereas relayfs
presumably would), leaving non-debugging relayfs applications high and
dry if the fs part of relayfs was removed.
Other than that, it doesn't really matter whether relay files live in
relayfs or debugfs.  At one point I even had a preliminary patch that
would convert fs/relayfs/* -> fs/relay_file.c.  I could resurrect that
patch if it makes sense - from a user standpoint, the only differences
would be be that userspace would open and read relay files in
/mnt/debug instead of /mnt/relay and the kernel side would use the
debugfs directory creation functions instead of the relayfs
counterparts.
Or just leave relayfs as is, except that in that case, I do still
think these patches make sense.
