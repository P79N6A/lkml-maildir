This would be a good time to learn the right way to do this: how do I build a
driver from a kernel tree without building the whole tree?
Like, if I copy the 2.6.6 drivers to a new directory outside a kernel tree, is
there some magic make command I can give it to point it at the 2.6.10 tree for
the build environment including make includes and header files?
