If that's the case I would think that making it read-only would be a 
better solution, since I found this while creating a little tool to scan 
and see what's online and what's not. Obviously there can be exception 
cases for CPU0 and x86, but I would think that having the CPU0 for x86 
be read-only would be a quirk, and handled in the kernel.
