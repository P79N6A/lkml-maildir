That's exactly the thing I ranted about before. We keep the historic
view of emulated hardware and just wrap it into enough glue code instead
of doing an abstract design, which just gets rid of those hardware
assumptions at all. That's the big advantage of paravirtualization, but
the current way on paravirt ops is just ignoring this.
