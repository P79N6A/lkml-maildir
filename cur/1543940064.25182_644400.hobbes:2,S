nice cleanup.

best would be after the x86.git merge. We could push this via x86.git in 
fact, to line it up with whatever other changes there might be. -mm 
would be fine too, if there are pending patches in this area in -mm. 
(and i recall you did some global-scope suspend/resume changes that 
might interfere?)
