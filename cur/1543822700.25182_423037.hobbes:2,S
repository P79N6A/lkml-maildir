this is intentional, not a bug. The point of the code above is to ensure 
that every IRQ handler is executed on one CPU. I.e. the irq threads are 
semi-affine - they are strictly affine when executing a handler, but 
they may switch CPUs if the affinity mask points it elsewhere.
but ... we might be able to relax that. Potentially some IRQ handlers 
might assume per-cpu-ness, but that should be uncovered by 
DEBUG_PREEMPT's smp_processor_id() checks.

ah. This actually uncovered a real bug. We were calling __do_softirq() 
with interrupts enabled (and being preemptible) - which is certainly 
bad.
this was hidden before because the smp_processor_id() debugging code 
handles tasks bound to a single CPU as per-cpu-safe.
could you check the (totally untested) patch below and see if that fixes 
things for you? I've also added your affinity change.
