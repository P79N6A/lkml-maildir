Hi everybody,
a thousand thanks for Roman's excellent work. which I tested as implementation in 2.6.18-rc1-mm1.
I can use again „vga=791“ as kernel parameter, I do not suffer any keyboard errors anymore at boot prompt, and the kernel boots very quickly.
Fantastic!
BUT: This is a „Pentium-4-only“ solution. On my file server, which is a Pentium 3 machine, the kernel stops booting and hangs the machine, no matter if I use framebuffer console with „vga=791“ or not.
Would you please try to find a fix for every architecture at any speed?
Regards
Uwe
