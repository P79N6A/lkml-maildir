Ted,
Please add this to your list. Linux is unusable in these machines.
I have cc'ed Martin and Linus because they play in that PCI area.

I have attached a few details of what appears to be a PCI resource alloc
problem (IO ports from the look of it).
Note: This is on a dell lattitude machine that never booted before
with a docked setup.
Enjoy!
cheers,
jamal
