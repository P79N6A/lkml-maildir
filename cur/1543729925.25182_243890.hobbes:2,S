Probably. The VM decides when to push out data in 2.6.x. In 2.4.x we had
artificial hard limits on the number of dirty pages that were allowed to
exist, now all that is controlled by the VM.

Huh?

See above. Note that this is pretty much the way block devices work
too...

That's why we have added TCP support as well as congestion control
algorithms for UDP. I've seen no signs of new congestion issues with
2.6.x in tests on a clean network. Rather I've seen vastly improved
write performance against faster servers precisely because the new
VM-driven stuff allows us to cache more data both on the client and the
server side.

It sounds to me as if you really want to be using O_SYNC or (better
still) O_DIRECT writes. You basically want to stream the data to the
server immediately without any caching right?
The "sync" mount option should also give you similar behaviour.
