Its a pretty heavy duty case with lots of cooling fans. Its very easy to
reproduce. Start up 10 cp commands on the same partition, run hdparm
-t -T /dev/sda and it will lockup within 10 seconds.  The machine is rock
solid under heavy cpu, with no io traffic. It never has kernel panic'ked
(as i would expect with temperature problems.)  If you perform more
than one write command to the same partition at the very same time,
no matter what the type drive/device it is, it locks up.
Does anyone else successfully run linux and debian testing on alpha's
with 2.6 kernels?
