So by your definition, this method is useful only on outgoing emails
but never on incoming ones. I fail to see how it might be useful
outgoing if nobody checks incoming emails...

I think that *nobody* can tell whether the result will have positive
or negative effect. This list is populated by technical people who
will be able to participate to the test. A first approach would be
to add a header to the incoming emails telling how they have been
classified, so that people know if their config could lead them to
being blocked in the future. If, after a long test period, we notice
that it causes lots of false positives and that spams still don't
get detected, it may be time to give up on this method. Conversely,
if it turns out that only spam gets detected and that we have no
false positives, why not go one step further then ?
