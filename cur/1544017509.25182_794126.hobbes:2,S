Admin who sets is up knows what he is doing. Hope you will not argue
about the case, when admin will disable the oom-killer and will not be
able to log in.
Once again: this is an additional tunable which allows to easily solve
the problem showed here multiple times. And whily you did not try to
tune oom-adj yourself you continue arguing that it works the best. It
does not. Any solution for the showed problem is not a simple and
nice-looking, the one I proposed imo looks the most convenient for the
people who really work with the systems where described behaviour was
observed.

You should reread (better twice) what we are talking about here and what
and why patch was proposed. And how it works too.
