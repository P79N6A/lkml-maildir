I agree that your patch is a good idea.  I reviewed the latest  
incarnation and it makes sense to me.  And your comment concerning  
the flags is a very welcome addition.  Probably ought to find its way  
into Documentation/filesystems/Locking or vfs.txt or somewhere like  
that also.
Note that once your patch is applied I think it would make sense to  
follow up with a second patch to remove the I_LOCK flag completely.   
The only remaining uses are either together with I_NEW in which case  
I_LOCK can be removed altogether or can be substituted with I_NEW  
when only I_LOCK is used.  This is because no places remain where we  
set I_LOCK by itself any more with your patch.  The only place where  
we set it is the place where a new inode gets created in memory and  
in that place we also set I_NEW at the same time as I_LOCK.   
wait_on_inode() can then be changed to wait on I_NEW instead of on  
I_LOCKED.  That way we have one less confusing flag to worry about  
and things are much easier to understand.

The NTFS "fix" will not cause data corruption at all.  The usage in  
NTFS is very different...  I am afraid your patch does not address  
the deadlock with NTFS or rather it only addresses the inode write  
deadlock and does not address the get_new_inode() deadlock that  
exists with ilookup5() and is avoided by ilookup5_nowait().  This  
deadlock is inherent to what NTFS does so you don't need to worry  
about it.  (If you want I am happy to explain it but I would rather  
not waste my time explaining if no-one except me cares about it...)
Best regards,
	Anton
