Christoph has had ideas for cleanups in the irq-header-files area for a 
long time. My rough battleplan would be this:
- linux/interrupt.h should remain the highlevel driver API [which can be
  used by both physical (genirq or non-genirq) or virtual platforms].
  Only this file should be included by drivers.
- rename linux/irq.h to linux/irqchips.h, to make it less likely for
  drivers to include it accidentally.
- rename asm/irq.h to asm/irqchips.h
- most of linux/hardirq.h should merge into interrupt.h [the rest into
  linux/irqchips.h] and hardirq.h should be eliminated.
- merge asm/hardirq.h and asm/hw_irq.h into asm/irqchips.h.
Christoph, agreed?
