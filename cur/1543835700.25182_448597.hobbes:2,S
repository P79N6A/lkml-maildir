Ah, ok, I see. The socket structure would then be similar to a device
structure in the kernel. Perhaps you should use the name "host" instead
of "card" then as that is widely used in the other mmc host drivers. It
makes it easier when reviewing your future patches.

Some controllers are brain dead like this, which makes forward
compatibility a bit difficult. I just wanted to make sure as some
previous drivers have added this artificial restriction in just the
software.
I would still like it to bail out on an unknown type though as anything
else can generate really unpredictable and annoying bugs.

These are more functional in nature, and therefore exactly how things
should work.

The SD spec is focused on cards, not controllers. If you check their
controller spec (sdhci), you'll see that they've split it up.

That's all one can expect. :)
You could put some comments about the registers somewhere so that other
people working on the driver will now what you've already tested.
Reverse engineered drivers are usually difficult for others to get into,
so everything you document will increase the changes of more people
helping you out.
