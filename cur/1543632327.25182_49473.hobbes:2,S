Thanks much for the response.
Can you point me at any sources/references that can
enlighten me on how this works? I did find some
additional information in the IA32 s/w dev guide
(particularly, vol 3-10.3.2) which reiterated your
response, but it seemed to give short shrift to the
mechanism behind it (it suggested that the magic was
in the snooping by the memory controller and cpu).
