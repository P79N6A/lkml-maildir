Subject: [PATCH] tmpfs: time granularity fix for [acm]time going backwards
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

From: Robin H. Johnson <robbat2@gentoo.org>
I noticed a strange behavior in a tmpfs file system the other day, while
building packages - occasionally, and seemingly at random, make decided to
rebuild a target. However, only on tmpfs.
A file would be created, and if checked, it had a sub-second timestamp.
However, after an utimes related call where sub-seconds should be set, they
were zeroed instead. In the case that a file was created, and utimes(...,NULL)
was used on it in the same second, the timestamp on the file moved backwards.
After some digging, I found that this was being caused by tmpfs not having a
time granularity set, thus inheriting the default 1 second granularity.
Hugh adds: yes, we missed tmpfs when the s_time_gran mods went into 2.6.11.
Unfortunately, the granularity of CURRENT_TIME, often used in filesystems,
does not match the default granularity set by alloc_super.  A few more such
discrepancies have been found, but this is the most important to fix now.

This patch should probably be included for 2.6.17, despite how long the
bug has been around. It's a one-liner, with no side-effects.
