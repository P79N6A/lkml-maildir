I'm already working on it. I did a lot more stuff, but currently i'm
stuck with very first patch, i've tried to push to mister Andrew:
<http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-mm-commits&m=116198944205036&w=2>
As i'm using emacs, i cann't revert this open/save/close patch every
time. If someone with RH-based distro is willing to help, i'll be glad.
Version of make is Red Hat make-3.80-10.2.
Also, i want Sam Ravnborg to comment on that effort (e-mail added). Thanks.
