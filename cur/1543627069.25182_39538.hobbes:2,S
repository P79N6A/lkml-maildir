Are you sure?  Here's a quote from the GPL:

| binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on)

Modules for proprietary kernels seem to be okay, don't they?

I don't see the user space requirement.

This is extremely unlikely, as Microsoft is selling its own version of
an operation system with GNU components. ;-)
