I have no idea who's the best to ask for this.
I want to start a task in an initrd and have it stay running after init
is started.  Pretty much:
 - kernel boot
 - initrd loaded
 - linuxrc executes
 - /bin/mydaemon runs
 - mount rootfs
 - pivot_root
 - exec /sbin/init (PID=1; linuxrc and sh is replaced)
 - mydaemon keeps running, reparented under init, uninterrupted
What's the feasibility of this without the system balking and vomiting
chunks everywhere?  I'm pretty sure 'exec /sbin/init' from linuxrc
(PID=1) will replace the process image of sh (linuxrc) with init,
keeping PID=1; but I'm worried this may terminate children too.  Haven't
tried.
(this actually has a useful application)
