It's not applicable within the RT-related changes. kmalloc anyway takes 
mutexes, so allocationg it in interrupt context is buggy.
*Legacy* kernel code does that but why produce a new code with that?

The rest of Linux still has a lot of bugs. Noone I guess is ready to 
argue that.

I haven't heard of USB device registers needing to be written in IRQ 
context. I'm not that well familiar with USB, so if you give such an 
example, that'd be fine.

Well, I know one such patch ;)

No problem... Has the driver been tested in stress conditions? If not, 
then I guess you can't say this for sure :)
