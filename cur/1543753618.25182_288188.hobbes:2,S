It could be that I just completely missed it, but I went to the 3ware
site and chose "7000".  There was not a "CLI" item, so I assumed there
wasn't a specific CLI just for the 7000s.  I later, however, found
that the 9000 CLIs (Normal and In-Eng) worked fine, so I never looked
for any others, such as 8000 or 8500 CLIs.  I may have made a mistake,
but I couldn't find a CLI in the "In Engineering"->"7000" section, and
I had a working solution, so I didn't try elsewhere.
Cheers,
