In SysV, the I_RECVFD ioctl on a stream pipe gives you a
struct strrecvfd which includes not only your file descriptor but also
the effective uid and gid of the sending user. So the functionality of
SCM_CREDENTIALS and SCM_RIGHTS are merged but you can pass your
credentials by passing a dummy file descriptor.
