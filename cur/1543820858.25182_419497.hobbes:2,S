But for using your suggested "separate kfree() which does check out of 
line" for not having the (otherwise unavoidable) space increast, we have 
to manually change kfree() callers.
My main question repeated:
Do you have any benchmarks where your approach brings a measurable
benefit? I wouldn't have expected kfree() being in many hotpaths.
