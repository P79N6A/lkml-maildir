Ooops, what I wrote was factually correct, but misleading.
What I meant was it looks like this:
   Zone     4kB     8kB    16kB    32kB    64kB   128kB   256kB   512kB  1024kB  2048kB Tot Pages/kb
    DMA     495     348     196      72      10       1       1       0       0       0 =     2807)
  @frag      0%     18%     42%     70%     91%     97%     98%    100%    100%    100% =    11228kB
 Normal       0    1579    1670     667     140      12       3       1       0       0 =    18118)
  @frag      0%      0%     17%     54%     84%     96%     98%     99%    100%    100% =    72472kB
If your model was correct, you would see free pages
per order run like
  N = a (K ^ (2^-o)); (for a>0, K>1, o=order)
This doesn't happen. Instead you get GOOD coalescence
at oder 0 (in the Normal zone they've ALL been coalesced),
and not bad at order 1 (see how many order 2's we have).
8 page unit is order 3 (32k). This system has 20% of
memory free at the point where I took the snap shot.
Probability would be, (1/5)^8 = 2^8 / 10^8 =
roughly p = 2.5 x 10^-6. In a system with 32000 pages
(128Kb), if you were right, I'd expect to see about
0.08 free pages at order 3. But here I see 750.
The chance of seeing more than 500 events of probability
p = 2.5 ^ (10^-6) across 32000 samples, is vanishingly
small. Yet it looks this way all the time.
Hence I conclude your model is wrong :-)
