It turned out that the real reason for the kernel oops I reported
previously was a defect in one of the memory modules in my SMP server.
Unfortunately this defect first showed up in coincidence with other
problems.  So the whole picture has been a little bit confusing to me
and maybe also to other people.
So by now I maybe add another data point to this story. My second
SMP-server (450 MHz PII, kernel 2.2.3) is up and running since 78 days
without showing any problems together with xntpd. My to Jeff is now: Do
you
use PII ore PIII prozessors in your system and have you considered any
memory defects?
