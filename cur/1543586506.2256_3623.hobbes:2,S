> Mount NFS device areas with NFSv2. Thats the standard workaround
Oh, sure. We survived with 16 bits and we'll survive with 32.
Nevertheless it is a bad sign that you have to start talking
about workarounds even before the new system has been implemented.
(And NFSv2 has its quirks as well.
Solaris will split the 32-bit number (the size given in a CREATE
request) into 14+18 when it is not a 16-bit value, while it will
split it into 8+8 if it is. FreeBSD will regard it as a 8+24 dev_t.
So, in general, different systems will parse the same dev_t in
different ways, and hence see different (major,minor) for the
same device.)
