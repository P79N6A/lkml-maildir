For anything recent, you really want the IDE support in 2.4.19-preX (latest
is -pre8).

Usually -X## commands are just asking for trouble these days (the driver
should be doing it on its own, and in the newer kernels, it does). The
most that should be needed is "hdparm -d1" and that's only needed if the
"DMA enabled by default" config option wasn't enabled at kernel compile
time.

In this kind of situation you want to turn off the power to the machine
for a few minutes, ideally unplugging the machine from mains if you really
want to be sure. If the IDE controller somehow gets confused, a "hard
reset" alone isn't enough to fix things (speaking from personal
experience).
I doubt there is physical damage, but I don't know for sure. In any case,
try unplugging the thing for a few minutes, and see if you still have
problems. (Make sure you do *not* use that hdparm -X34 option.)

I would start by trying 2.4.19-pre8. If that doesn't help, there are even
newer IDE driver patches on 
http://www.linuxdiskcert.org/
 which might be
worth a try.
