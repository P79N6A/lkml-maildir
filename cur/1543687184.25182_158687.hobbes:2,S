Well, then you have a problem, at least with RFC-985 as quoted in my other
email.
If your host has two interfaces on two different pyhsical nets and host A from
net A shall be contacted by a service bound to your interface on net B you will
obviously send an arp request with a source ip from wrong subnet.
I did not read the code, I take your code explanation as true, of course.
It is very likely you will not receive a valid answer in this case:
<quote RFC-985>
An ARP request is discarded if the source IP address is not in the same subnet.
