Yes, unless Linus has changed his mind since March.  Which would be his
privilege, of course -- but since the CML1 maintainers are unanimous that 
CML1 is too kludgy to live and Linus knows that, it seems unlikely.

All governments are more or less combinations against the
people. . .and as rulers have no more virtue than the ruled. . .
the power of government can only be kept within its constituted
bounds by the display of a power equal to itself, the collected
sentiment of the people.
