LBR is mainly useful on wild branches to random addresses.  As such,
you really only need to disable LBR in the page fault handler.  For a
long time, KDB had LBR support with this replacement for the i386 page
fault handler.
#if defined(CONFIG_KDB)
ENTRY(page_fault_mca)
       pushl %ecx
       pushl %edx
       pushl %eax
       movl  $473,%ecx
       rdmsr
       andl  $0xfffffffe,%eax          /* Disable last branch recording */
       wrmsr
       popl  %eax
       popl  %edx
       popl  %ecx
       pushl $do_page_fault
       jmp error_code
#endif
Nobody was using the LBR feature of KDB so I removed it in 2.6.17.
