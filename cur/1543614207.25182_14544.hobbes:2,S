Please NO NO NO NO!!
Why on earth is it good to develop misunderstandings and inconsistency
with well- and widely-known historical abbrevs?
I (and I think I'm far not alone) would hate to see those abbrevs. I
really don't want to vomit every time I read configure.help or an
ifconfig output.
This is a 3-year old decision, and haven't seen it in use anywhere before.
If this knew style would be the common use in IT, then this change is OK.
But _not_ now. (and hopefully never).
So may I suggest considering this change a few years later, _if_ it comes
into common use?
