Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Greetings:
The 2.4.19-pre3 works just dandy as it is without this patch,
but it is needed for O(1) scheduler. I think Martin was going
to forward this into 2.5.x tree, where O(1) is standard.
The problem is that schedule_tail() is supposed to unlock
runqueue, but if interrupts are enabled before that happens,
a timer tick may squeeze in and deadlock. I observed such
situation myself.
So, I would like this to be in 2.4.19 for the sake of O(1) users.
Any objections?
