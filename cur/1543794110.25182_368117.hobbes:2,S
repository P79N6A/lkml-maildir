I updated the corresponding bugzilla, repeating here for those
not watching bugzilla updates. This turned out to be a bogus
warning. The PCI express bridges on this machine do not
support any capabilities that require an interrupt (hotplug,
advanced error reporting). So, it's ok for the BIOS to not
report interrupt routing for the bridges.
I'll clean up the warning as part of the PCI express work I
expect to start soon.
