Been a bit busy lately, but after the power went off last night, I 
decided to finish my compile of the latest (afaict) mjc kernel.
Already commented out a function (it was several days ago, I can't 
remember it.) that was obsoleted by the radix tree patch. Now, I come up 
w/ this error in modules_install .
Ideas?
depmod: *** Unresolved symbols in 
/lib/modules/2.4.18-pre9-mjc2/kernel/drivers/scsi/sd_mod.o
depmod: 	blkdev_varyio
TIA
