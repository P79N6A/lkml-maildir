Very sorry, I ment that the original modules.*map files are 300% larger
than the diethotplug binary.
Hm, for the options I use in 2.5.31 I get these results:
  modules.pcimap	  6273 bytes
  modules.usbmap	 98513 bytes
  modules.ieee1394map	    73 bytes
  ----------------------------------
  total			104859 bytes
  diethotplug binary	 16332 bytes
Looks like the modules.*map files are closer to 650% larger :)
thanks,
