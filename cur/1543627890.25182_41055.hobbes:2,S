Hi,
I've been thinking about your comment, and I realized it was a good
suggestion.
There are no problem with the zerocopy NFS, but If you want to
use UDP sendfile for streaming or something like that, you wouldn't
get good performance.

There may be many threads on a streaming server and they would share
the same UDP socket. UDP_CORK mechanism requires semaphore to serialize
sending data and it would block each other for a long time because
sendfile() might have the threads sleep in BIO as you said.
You may say we can use MSG_MORE instead of UDP_CORK.
When we use it, we have to make multiple queue for each destination for
clientns. But we can't link pages to the queue as sendfile() have no
arguments specifying the destination.
client UDP sockets
+---------+
|dest:123 |---------+
|         |         |
+---------+         | server
                    V UDP socket
+---------+        +---------+ <--- thread1
|dest:123 |------->|src:123  | <--- thread2
|         |        |dest:ANY | <--- thread3
+---------+        +---------+ <--- thread4
                    A
+---------+         |
|dest:123 |---------+
|         |
+---------+
Shall I make a multiple queue based on pid instead of destitation address ?
Any idea is welcome!
Thank you,
Hirokazu Takahashi
