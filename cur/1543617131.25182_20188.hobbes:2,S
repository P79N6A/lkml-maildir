A real RT task has hard guarantees and to all intents and purposes you may
deem the system failed if it ever misses one (arguably if you cannot verify
it will never miss one).
The stuff we care about is things like DVD players which tangle with
sockets, pipes, X11, memory allocation, and synchronization between multiple
hardware devices all running at slightly incorrect clocks.
