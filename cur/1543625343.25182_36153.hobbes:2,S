Super!

The solution I prefer is to have loop_make_request() block when we run
out of pre-allocated buffers, ie similar to "normal" block drivers when
they run out of request slots. This provides a nice throttling mechanism
and makes sure that loop doesn't eat into the memory polls too heavily.
In any way, do it one way and remove the other.

So the 'new' version does exactly the same, but doesn't do it in
loop_get_buffer().
