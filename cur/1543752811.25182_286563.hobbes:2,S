When they 'disappear', use `arp -d hostname` to delete the
entry from the ARP tables. Then see if you can ping it.
It is possible that the destination machine got re-routed
and the new router's HW address wasn't updated in the
ARP tables. If this is the case, I don't know hot to 'fix'
it, but it's a new data-point. When you have dynamic routing,
there needs to be some way to update the ARP tables even though
they eventually expire.
The fact that `ping -r` works seems to show that the ARP table
has stale entries in it.
