  I doubt you are going to be able to apply the std xfs patch to
pre10ac2.  On the other hand if you grab xfs out of cvs you'll have
2.4.19pre10+xfs.  You might be able to produce a patch from that
(2.4.19pre10 -> 2.4.19pre10+xfs) applies fairly cleanly to pre10ac2. 
I'd check and see if 2.4.18-pre10ac2 even boots before trying that;-)

  Opps my bad.  I've got both the ultratraks, and fasttraks floating
around in various systems.
