Subject: 2.0.36 kswapd gone insane?

Soemthing has become sick with my Linux box.  I've never noticed this 
before and there seems to not be a problem...  At least I dont think 
there is because nothing other than the insane time for kflushd shows.
The system is an i486/66 computer and based on the uptime the amount of 
time kswapd has spent is impossible. Right about 4,637 minutes of uptime.  
The system hasn't been under unusual stress.  Earlier today the httpd got 
swapped out and took an irate amount of time to swap in.  No errors in 
/var/log/messages  Nothing on console, and dmesg leaves no clues except 
for a kludge of lines:
MASQ: failed TCP/UDP checksum from 216.119.135.31!
MASQ: failed TCP/UDP checksum from 216.119.135.31!
MASQ: failed TCP/UDP checksum from 216.119.135.31!
MASQ: failed TCP/UDP checksum from 216.119.135.31!
MASQ: failed TCP/UDP checksum from 216.119.135.31!
MASQ: failed TCP/UDP checksum from 216.119.135.31!
Currently it's used to service as a router/www server for me.  I've got 
three boxen online that use it as a router, and other than that nothing.
Can anyone help?
On PS output I get this:
