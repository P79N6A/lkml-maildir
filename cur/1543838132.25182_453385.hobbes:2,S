This aspect of the patch became moot because of the change to a single
reserve for all layer 2 delivery in Peter's more recent revisions.
*However* maybe it is worth mentioning that I intended to provide a
pointer from each sk_buff to a common accounting struct.  This pointer
is set by the device driver.  If the driver knows nothing about memory
accounting then the pointer is null, no accounting is done, and block
IO over the interface will be dangerous.  Otherwise, if the system is
in reclaim (which we currently detect crudely when a normal allocation
fails) then atomic ops will be done on the accounting structure.
I planned to use the (struct sock *)sk_buff->sk field for this, which
is unused during layer 2 delivery as far as I can see.  The accounting
struct can look somewhat like a struct sock if we like, size doesn't
really matter, and it might make the code more robust.  Or the field
could become a union.
Anyway, this bit doesn't matter any more, the single global packet
delivery reserve is better and simpler.

Daniel
