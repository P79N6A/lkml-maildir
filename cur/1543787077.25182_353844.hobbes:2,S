This will still only drains the current CPUs pcps in an MP environment (leaving the other CPUs with their lists intact).  I will send this patch later today.

I don't understand. How can you set the high watermark at half the batch
size? Makes no sense to me.
And can you give a stricter definiton of what you mean by "low memory
conditions"? I agree we ought to empty the lists before going OOM or
anything, but not at the slightest feather of pressure ... answer lies
somewhere inbetween ... but where?
