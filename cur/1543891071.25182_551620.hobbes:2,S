No, you're keeping these obfuscating macros around:
+#define return_VOID                     return
+#define return_ACPI_STATUS(s)           return(s)
+#define return_VALUE(s)                 return(s)
+#define return_UINT8(s)                 return(s)
Making the ACPI code look like regular Linux kernel code (or even
regular C for that matter) was the whole point of my patch. Your patch
doesn't change that.
