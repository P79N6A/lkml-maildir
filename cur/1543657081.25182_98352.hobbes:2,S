That seems to be the root of the problem: ->entries requires 4 byte 
alignment, while struct poll_list requires 8 byte alignment. Thus the 
compiler aligns entries to a 4-byte boundary, and rounds up 
sizeof(struct poll_list) to 16.
Attached is a small test case that shows the problem on both 64-bit and 
32-bit platforms. I'm not sure if this is a gcc bug: the Compaq C 
compiler on Tru64 and MSVC on Windows generate the same structure layout.
