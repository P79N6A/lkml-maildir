Heiko,
	Thanks for the hint. Here's a patch to enable generation of
uevents for user creation/deletion. These uevents can be handled in
userspace to configure a new user's cpu share.
Note : After bootup I could test that new user's cpu share is configured
as per a configuration file (/etc/user_cpu_share.conf). However this
mechanism didnt work for root user. Perhaps uevent for root user is
generated way too early?
A HOWTO text file is also attached explaining how to make use of these
uevents in userspace.
Ingo,
	This patch applies on top of latest sched-devel tree. Pls review
and apply ..

Generate uevents when a user is being created/destroyed. These events
could be used to configure cpu share of a new user.

This HOWTO explains the steps required to configure a user's cpu share 
automatically when he/she logs in. This has been verified to work on
a Redhat distribution.
Note : This HOWTO is a *hack* to get things working quickly. In particular it 
doesn't follow standards like LSB.
1. Create a file /etc/user_cpu_share.conf with this format:
	[uid]	[cpu_share]
   Ex:
	512	1024	#user vatsa
	514	512	#user guest
2. Create a script, named "kernel.agent" in /etc/hotplug directory 
   as follows. Make that script executable and owned by root.
#!/bin/sh
#
# kernel hotplug agent for 2.6 kernels
#
#       ACTION=add
#       DEVPATH=/kernel/uids/[uid]
#
cd /etc/hotplug
. ./hotplug.functions
case $ACTION in
add)
	uid=${DEVPATH##*/}
	line=`grep -w $uid /etc/user_cpu_share.conf`
	if [ $? -eq 0 ]
	then
		cpu_share=`echo $line | awk '{print $2}'`
		echo $cpu_share > /sys/$DEVPATH/cpu_share
	fi
	;;
