Ok problem solved, I totally forgot about badblocks.  It's been soooo
long since I've had a disk with actual physical errors (I've had my
share of dead disks however!).  Anyways I just ran badblocks and remade
the swap partition avoiding those blocks.
Thanks to all the people who mailed me off the list to remind of this
simple solution.
Best Regards,
sb
