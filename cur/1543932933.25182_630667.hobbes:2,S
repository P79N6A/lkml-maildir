well, there's an easy solution for unification patches: the resulting 
object files must have _exactly the same_ content as without the 
unification patches. (Modulo strings as WARN_ON()s referring to 
include-file names.)
If they differ then the unification did something wrong. With your 
patchset and the config i sent, the difference is visible in the image 
size already:
   text     data   bss     dec              hex    filename
   7763766  967330 5812328 14543424         ddea40 vmlinux.after
   7763811  967330 5812328 14543469         ddea6d vmlinux.before
also, reducing the size and scope of changes helps as well - because 
that way it can be bisected down to specific changes. Mistakes 
inevitably happen, especially if you do not enforce a rigid 
byte-for-byte correctness along the way. You did 5 rather large patches, 
and it's not testable because your unification steps were too coarse.
In other words: you were asking for trouble and you got it :-)
