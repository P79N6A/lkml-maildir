No, since this is just an ordinary jump through the PLT.  That the
target DSO is synthesized is irrelevant.  It's ld.so which needs the PIC
setup, not the called DSO.

But this isn't true.  The address can change.  There are already two
flavors (normal and 4G/4G) and there will probably be more.  Ingo would
have to comment on that.

A direct jump is hardcoding the information which is exactly what should
be avoided.

The symbol for the syscall stub in libc is looked up, yes, but nothing
else.  I fail to see the relevence.  You cannot say that since a call
already requires N ns it is OK for it to take 2*N ns.

Because they are all at different level and to abstract out different
things.

Not as much as any other acceptable solution.  The vdso code is compiled
for a given address and therefore the memory loads can use absolute
addresses.

This is certainly not what many people think.  In general, every
dependency on the runtime for programs to take advantage of new kernel
features is bad and should be avoided.  If I'd write kernel code I'd
want to control the use as much as possible.  And this trivial jump
table can do this very efficiently.

Pragmatically?  How about "practically"?  Mind you, for x86 the code
wouldn't be as simple as the vgettimeofday call on x86-64.  For x86-64
all acceptable kernels had the vsyscall and therefore glibc doesn't have
to worry about it not being available.  And there currently in no second
or third location for the vDSO.
For x86 we have to handle in the same binary old kernels and kernels
where the vDSO is at a different address than the stock kernel.  This
means the computation of the address consists of several step.  Get the
vDSO address (passed up in the auxiliary vector), adding the magic
offset, and then jumping.
