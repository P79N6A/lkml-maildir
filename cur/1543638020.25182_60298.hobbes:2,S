You can use a symlink, but it was an explicit design decision to not go 
that direction. If we create device nodes in the kernel, we're giving 
userspace something to use, even if we really, really want them to use 
symlinks. We're implementing a default naming policy. And, if it is there, 
people will use it. 
We don't want people to use that naming scheme. We don't want people to
rely on the naming scheme. It gives us a little more freedom and room to
move around in the future, should we ever decide that some part of it was
a bad idea. That's not to say that the interface is going to be volatile
forever. But, it will happen that some part of it will suck and need to be
redone.
But, why should the kernel even deal with it? It's a problem that is so 
much better done in userspace. It's configurable, scalable, and easily 
managable. Forcing userspace to have and use this freedom makes things so 
much simpler for both us and them.

A little clarification about the term subsystem: I use the term to talk
about both class drivers and bus drivers. I don't have an exact definition 
of the word, but I basically consider it to be a collection of programming 
interfaces and components that register with it. 
Ok, it's a shoddy definition. But, in the context, I was talking about the 
class subsystem that the driver registers the device with. Does that help 
at all?

Yes, and the idea is to pass the physical device path to /sbin/hotplug 
when the device is inserted, so it can get at the device attributes.

Yep.
