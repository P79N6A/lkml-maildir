Note that this could also be something like:
Processor	: ARM/VLSI Arm1020id(wb)BRR rev 1 (v4)
or:
Processor	: ARM ARM926EJ-Sid(wb)RR rev 2 (v5)
It might change further if the manufacturer decides to have a space
in their name.  Basically, /proc/cpuinfo was never meant to be passed
by programs, and its not something I'd like to support with the current
format.
