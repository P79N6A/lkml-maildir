As long as "don't cache" doesn't imply "don't buffer." In the case of a 
large copy or other large single-file write (8.5GB backup DVDs come to 
mind), the desired behavior is to buffer if possible, start writing 
immediately (data will not change in buffer), and release the buffer as 
soon as write is complete. That doesn't seem to be the current 
interpretation of DONTNEED. Or O_DIRECT either, I agree.

In linux if you point the gun at your foot and pull the trigger it goes 
bang. I have no problem with that.

Why should the kernel make an effort to remember? Incompetence, like 
virtue, is its own reward.

The problem with the suggested Linux implementation is that it's 
complex, and currently would move a lot of the logic into user space, in 
code which is probably not portable, or might tickle bad behavior on 
other systems.
Around 2.4.16 (or an -aa variant) I tried code to track writes per file, 
and if some number of bytes had been written to a file without a read or 
seek, any buffered blocks were queued to be written. This got around the 
behavior of generating data until memory was full, then writing it all 
out and having the disk very busy. It was just a proof of concept, but 
it did spread the disk writes to a more constant load and more 
consistent response to other i/o. There doesn't seem to be an easy 
tunable to do this, probably because the need isn't all that common.
