indirect function calls aren't that expensive anymore.  especially when you
consider CPUs at 500 MHz and PCI still running at 33 MHz, a few cycles for
an indirect call aren't all that terrible.

The serial driver suffers from other drivers leaving interrupts disabled for
too long.  Making the calls indirect wouldn't be a problem (except on old
386-class machines, that is).

It is in generic alpha kernels.

yuck.
