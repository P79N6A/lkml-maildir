Marco:
FWIW, the Red Hat kernel RPMs effectively do the following when they 
package kernel modules:
 	strip -g <module.ko>
This is done via the script:
 	/usr/lib/rpm/brp-strip
which is implicitly run on all executable files packaged in the RPM.
If you ensure that the module .ko file is executable, then RPM will strip 
it for you automatically.
