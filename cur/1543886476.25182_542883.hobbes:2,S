Probably talking about tab-completion in the shell, countering the comment 
that names that long are too unwieldy to use.
On the other hand, limits are always bad. Haven't we seen bajillions of 
cases in computing history where we start with limits (like only N of the 
first characters of identifiers used in compilers), followed by people 
finding those limits annoying, then followed by the limits being removed? 
How about the Year-20?? limitations? Same thing: limits that were fine, 
then limits were not fine, then limits were removed.
In this era, couldn't we just skip the whole thing and stop putting limits 
in from the beginning? The only reason to have a PATH_MAX/NAME_MAX at all 
is to make life easier for programmers implementing things and people 
using things. It would require a LOT of work and changes, but life would 
be so much better if there were a (configurable, of course!) option to say 
"use standard values" or "use custom values" or "use runtime-dynamic 
values". Option 1: No change. Option 2: Alter your limits.h too, and 
recompile programs (or fix them). Option 3: Change programs from 
compile-time inclusion of limits.h to run-time checking of a /sys value.
