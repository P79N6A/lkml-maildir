It is striking that Jörg Schilling's code alone uses this naming scheme,
and nothing else appears to be. If there is, perhaps naming a few
typical real-world applications could enlighten us. You haven't
mentioned examples yet, so there isn't even a faint hint cdrecord is
consistent with the so-called real-world.
