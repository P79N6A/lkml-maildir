Subject: 2.2.17pre series breaks 3C905C support ?

Hi all,
	I upgraded from the 2.2.14 kernel (RH 6.2 default) to 2.2.17pre10
and i found that my 3Com 905C card was no longer operational.
Is the driver broken in some way ? My 3C905B cards work perfectly..only
the 3C905C does not. The driver also seems to load up correctly and 
auto detects the card, ifconfig shows the card is configured and packets
are being transmitted but the connect/link light on the switch and card
are inactive. Switching back to 2.2.14 corrects this problem and the
link light comes back on. There is no problem reports in the logs with
both kernels and no error packets show up in ifconfig.
Any help would be appreciated.
Thanks.
