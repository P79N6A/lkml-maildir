I think it depends on the transport being used: some transports could allow 
for metadata (i.e. a MIME-compatible transport) while some others don't. Of 
course, the remote side needs to also support metadata (i,e. using a 
MIME-compatible transport against a remote host that doesn't understand 
metadata is certainly impossible).
For example, with FTP transports, I guess the only possible option is to 
transfer the unnamed/default stream. NFS should allow metadata, but this 
probably needs some kind of extensions to the NFS protocol.
