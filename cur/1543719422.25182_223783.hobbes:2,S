It's an unofficial gcc version, but it's not necessary more buggy than 
other versions of gcc.
And Documentation/Changes in Linux 2.6.6 also tells that your statement
is wrong:

...
The Red Hat gcc 2.96 compiler subtree can also be used to build this tree.
You should ensure you use gcc-2.96-74 or later. gcc-2.96-54 will not build
the kernel correctly.

His problem is as far as I can see in no way related to the gcc version 
he's using.
