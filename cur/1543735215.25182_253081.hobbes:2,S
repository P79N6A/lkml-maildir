Which unsigned int?! ;-) The expression a - b is negative for unsigned
ints a and b where a < b. So, your unsigned ints "total" and
"remaining" won't be negative of
course, but they won't reflect what is actually left in the buffer;
they will equal the
value of len (in some cases) after fifo->head has wrapped (because of the 
unsignedness) and fifo->tail has not. Which would not be correct.
