You may not use the ibm_acpi driver at the same time as the acpiphp
driver for docking.  This is because the ibm_acpi driver also tries to
handle the dock event notification, and doesn't actually do any
hotplugging of the devices.  So, you want to set that config option to
N.  What you are doing above is actually writing to the ibm_acpi driver.
I didn't provide a way to do undocking via software. I just use the
button on the dock station.  You should however, see something
in /sys/bus/pci/slots - can you scan your dmesg to make sure that the
acpiphp driver is running?  You might run it as a module and enable
debugging:
modprobe acpiphp debug=1
This way we can see if it finds your dock slot and registers the notify
handler.
Thanks for testing!
