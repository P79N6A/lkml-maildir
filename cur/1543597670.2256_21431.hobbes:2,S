Hi all,
Under kernel 2.4.9pre2, I am unable to access my HP 8110
CD-RW drive.  I have an Abit vp6 board which is a dual PIII
and has the vt82cxxx chipset.  I dropped back to the 2.2.19
kernel + Andre Hedrick's IDE patch and everything works
fine.
If you need any further information, let me know and I'll
do my best to provide it.
Shane
