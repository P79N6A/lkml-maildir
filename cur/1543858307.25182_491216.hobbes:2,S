As I already mentioned the kernel parameter "iommu=soft" fixes
the data corruption for me. We saw no more data corruption
during a test on 48 machines over the last week-end. Chris
Wedgewood already confirmed that this setting fixed the data
corruption for him, too.
Of course, the big question "Why does the hardware iommu *not*
work on those machines?" still remains.
I have also tried setting "memory hole mapping" to "disabled"
instead of "hardware" on some of the machines and this *seems*
to work stable, too. However, I did only test it on about a
dozen machines because this bios setting costs us 1 GB memory
(and iommu=soft does not).
BTW: Maybe I should also mention that other machines types
(e.g. the HP xw9300 dual opteron workstations) which also use a
NVIDIA chipset and Opterons never had this problem as far as I
know.
Best regards,
Karsten
