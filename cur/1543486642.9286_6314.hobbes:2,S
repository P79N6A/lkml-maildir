If the context switches are performed in userland, they should be much
faster than 1000 cycles.  I expect multiple heaps will still be a win in
many cases, much as using different heaps for different object
types/sizes is often a win.

I don't know about typical pthreads programs.  The "fast, really I mean
fast" threads that I'm talking about is indeed user-on-kernel-threads.
Kernel threads isn't even an option for the >50,000 threads I have in
mind.  I'm not talking about being silly with threads here for the sake
of it.  I'm talking about having >50,000 objects in a simulation, which
most of the time don't need a locally allocated stack or kernel context.
However, occasionally they do need one (when they block, or page to
disk).
The intention is (1) that a typical fast "schedule calling 50,000
objects' `think()' methods" list+heap scheduler runs most of the objects
efficiently (without individual stack frames); (2) some processing
continues even while paging; (3) a few objects can use operating system
services and get their own stack frame (on demand), while being able to
use the same mutex/semaphore/message services as the 50,000 simulated
objects.
