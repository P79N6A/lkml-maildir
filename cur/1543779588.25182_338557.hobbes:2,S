Same here (s/debian/ubuntu/) but I have the exact same problem at the
console, I don't think it could be an X issue unless X was able to wedge

It feels like typing over a slow modem link, I can get about one word
ahead of the cursor (X or console, regardless of load) but the delay
seems to be constant.
