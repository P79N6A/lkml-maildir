For the removing speed issue, I remember there was a patch that can be applied 
to 2.0.36 that speeds up a deletion process quite a bit (on Linuxmama I believe)
.  I don't know if there was any discussion whether how safe it is, but I loved
the patch.
For the stopping issue, it has been my habit to suspend( = STOP) and do 'bg' 
whenever I want to do something else immediately after issuing 'rm'.  I don't
see why the foreground process 'rm' must be blocked since whenever an 'rm' is
issued, the kernel can simply launch a thread that removes the inodes - there
is no point of blocking the process.
IMHO,
