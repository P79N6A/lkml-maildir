It was Apache. Apache showed corporate users and small businesses
desperate to cash in on the Interweb c. 1995-1998 that they could do
it w/out paying some proprietary vendor and get better performance,
security and support to boot (I reported a bug in Apache JServ in 1998
and a fix was released by the time I came back from lunch 1/2 hour
later). Linux was a tool for UNIX sysadmins and admin wannabes to
practice their UNIX chops at home - or a conveniently inexpensive
platform on which to run Apache. Companies -- other than Linux
distributors -- didn't bet their business on it.
Apache's success greatly contributed to the corporate acceptance of Linux, IMHO.
