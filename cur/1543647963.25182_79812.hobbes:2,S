I don't think you told us the kernel version?
There have been recent fixes wrt sizing of the BIOs which the
direct-io layer sends down.  So please make sure that you're
testing Linus's current -bk, or 2.5.42 plus
http://www.zip.com.au/~akpm/linux/patches/2.5/2.5.42/2.5.42-mm2/broken-out/dio-bio-add-fix-1.patch
Either that, or raid5 is bust ;)
