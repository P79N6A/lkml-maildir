No, it's nothing to do with the fprintf.  I tried the program without
any fprints at all and got the same result.
I'm pretty sure the problem is in glibc.  Look at malloc_atfork and
free_atfork in glibc's malloc/arena.c.  I think the reason you are only
seeing it happen when you malloc is that glibc only initializes the
malloc system when you first use it.
I am not sure it is really a problem though.  I don't think you should
be allowed to fork inside a signal handler.  That seems very wrong.
