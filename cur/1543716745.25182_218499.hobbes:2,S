Learning patch-scripts? :)

Dirty bit is transferred to the struct page when page is moved to the
inactive list, where pages are not supposedly referenced/dirtied
frequently. Besides, additional IO, if any, will be done through
->writepages() which is much more efficient than single-page pageout
from tail of the inactive list.

Another possible scenario where early transfer of dirty bit could be
useful: huge file consisting of single hole is mmapped, and user level
starts dirtying all pages. Current VM thinks happily that all memory is
clean, ->writepages() is not invoked. VM scanning starts, shrink_list()
dirties page-at-a-time
(shrink_list()->try_to_unmap()->set_page_dirty()), and calls
->writepage() that has to insert meta-data for the hole page (extent,
indirect pointer, whatever), and to submit IO. As order of pages at the
inactive list corresponds to the order of page faults (i.e., random),
this will result in the horrible fragmentation.
Nikita.
