If you can make it run a regexp over the whole file at once rather
than a line at a time, you can deal with this with multi-line regexps.
Roughly, match:
 a +++ patch header followed by
 any number of lines not starting with +++ followed by
 the actual target expression
So, approximately:
 /+++ [\w\/]+.c(.*)\\n((([^+])|(\+[^+]))\n)*extern.*/
Or you could just make search remember what file it's in as it walks
the list of lines. But as I mentioned, multiline regexps are useful
for things other than just remembering what file we're in.
