Where is the source for this HeavyLink module ? The lack of tainting implies
that it is GPL ?  Oh wait, you've been asked this before[1], but
chose to ignore it.
Remind me again, why you expect any help from linux-kernel, when you've
previously gone out of your way to encourage the subversion of the
gpl-checking mechanisms in the kernel[2], and have no aparent intentions
of showing the code at fault.
