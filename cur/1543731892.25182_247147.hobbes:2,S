Hi Linus, Andrew, lkml.
Here follows a few kbuild updates.
None of these are critical fixes so they may live in -mm for a while,
but safe to add to mainline.
o Adaptions for solaris and cygwin
  - I would be happy to hear reports of outstanding issues when
  building a kernel on non-linux platforms
  - The primary target group for this is embedded people that
  often use non-Linux environements.
o new static analyser tool 'namespacecheck' from Keith Owens.
  - Try it on your code and fix the issues
  - The kernel shall be build before running the tool:
    -> make namespacecheck
    Read comments in scripts/namespacecheck.pl to interpret the output
  - The output is comprehensive: ~8000 lines for allmodconfig kernel
Patches not previously posted will be posted to lkml.
Everything pushed to:

	Sam
