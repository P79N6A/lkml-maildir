Subject: [PATCH] Hibernate: fix "swap breaks after hibernation failures"
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

The image writing code dropped a reference to the current swap device.
This doesn't show up if the hibernation succeeds - because it doesn't
affect the image which gets resumed.  But it means multiple _failed_
hibernations end up freeing the swap device while it is still use!
swsusp_write() finds the block device for the swap file using swap_type_of().
It then uses blkdev_get() / blkdev_put() to open and close the block device.
Unfortunately, blkdev_get() assumes ownership of the inode of the block_device
passed to it.  So blkdev_put() calls iput() on the inode.  This is by design
and other callers expect this behaviour.  The fix is for swap_type_of() to take
a reference on the inode using bdget().
