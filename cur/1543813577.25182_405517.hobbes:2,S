ok, perhaps things might look something like this?
    - A check_error() function checks a device for errors.  As you
      mention above, this may be a device-specific check method or a
      function like pci_check_parity_errors(dev, flags).  In either
      case, if check_error() finds an error, it clears the error from
      the device's registers and returns the error.  If check_error()
      finds multiple errors, here are couple of options:
          - Return a list of all errors detected.
          - Return a single error along with a boolean value that says
            whether more errors are present.  If so, check_error() may
            be called repeatedly until no errors remain.
    - A handle_error() function handles errors returned by
      check_error().  Here are a few options: Each device may have a
      handle_error() method that takes an error as a parameter.  Or,
      each type of error may have its own handle_me() method.  A third
      option is something like pci_handle_parity_error(dev, error).
      In any case, depending on the error type, the handler may choose
      to feed the error to EDAC.
    - Each hardware subsystem or device driver may determine its own
      error checking/handling strategy.  Some may want to poll for
      errors.  Others may want error detection to be asynchronous
      (driven by interrupts or exceptions).  Or a subsystem may poll
      for some kinds of errors and detect others asynchronously.  As
      you suggest, errors may also be checked for in other situations,
      such as after firmware init.
      For polling, the poll function calls check_error(), and then
      calls handle_error() if an error is found.  For interrupt-driven
      error checking, the interrupt handler calls check_error().  If
      an error is found, the interrupt handler may either call
      handle_error() directly or defer invocation of handle_error()
      outside interrupt context.  If the interrupt is an NMI, deferred
      invocation of handle_error() allows it to execute without
      introducing deadlocks or race conditions.
    - For some types of hardware, at boot time the device's registers
      contain spurious error info, which should be discarded.  This
      may be done by calling check_error() and discarding the results.

Sounds good.

Cool!  I think this also coincides with what Doug is saying.  Doug, how
does this sound?
