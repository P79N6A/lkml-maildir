To preface this, I don't really know what I'm talking about so ignore me
if this is stupid.  
I understand you are coalescing the freed requests to add them back to
the freelist in a batch, but this is done only for 'write' requests,  so
it makes sense that the wake_up is postponed until the list_splice of
the pending_list into the write_list.
But, it looks like with your patch, if the req->free_list is the 'read'
freelist the wake_up will *never* happen (unlike in the original
version).  Is this missing wake_up intended?  
(you mentioned in an earlier post that read requests can be stolen from
the write free_list, I suppose if your code is correct it has something
to do with this fact :-) as I said, I know next to nothing here, just
learning)
