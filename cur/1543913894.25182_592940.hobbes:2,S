Hi Alan,
Thanks for your quick reply.
Actually I want to call the BIOS run time functions as per the 
PNPBIOSSpecification-v1.0a (attached).
Specifically I want to call the function no 0x0 to 0x03. I have 
Dual-Core AMD Opteron(tm) Processor 2216 and AMI BIOS with the pnp bios 
support.
So I could call this functions using the default PnP driver which comes 
along with the (API: call_pnp_bios()) i386 architecture. This driver is 
only available for i386. But not for x86_64.
So I am trying to implement a driver similar to this for x86_64 arch. 
But I couldn't .
Because there is need for get_cpu_gdt_table() which is not available in 
x86_64.
And also some inline asm needs to be totally modify for x86_64. For this
How can I achive this ? Is there any other alternate idea there instead 
of pnp driver?
Please help on this.
