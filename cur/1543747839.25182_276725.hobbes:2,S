I think that _all_ of these items can find use in userspace, if they are 
usable with glibc's threading implementation and the other userspace 
issues that would be involved.
I for one would love to be able to use lightweight rwsems and spinlocks 
in an application I'm working on, but it's entirely userspace and it 
would be impossible for _me_ to pick out this code from the kernel tree 
and make it work on any architecture that I don't have here (which is 
all of them except x86 <G>).
