Subject: [2.5.70-bk1] Compilation failures ppa.c imm.c

There is a compilation error on line 280 of ppa.c.
Should
	if (ppa_hosts[i] == host)
Be
	if ((struct Scsi_Host *)&ppa_hosts[i] == host)
??
Also, imm.c fails to compile on line 112 claiming that imm_proc_info is 
undeclared by that point.
Any questions?
