I switched from 2.5.73 to 2.5.75 yesterday, and I've encountered three hard 
lockups in the 24 hours I've been running the new kernel.  When I reset the 
machine, I don't see anything unusual in the logs.
The machine is a dual PIII with aic7899 SCSI and 3c905c network on the 
motherboard.  In all three cases where I locked up, there was network and 
disk IO going on.  I don't really have any more info.
If anyone would like to give me a list of things to try, I'd be happy to do 
some testing.
