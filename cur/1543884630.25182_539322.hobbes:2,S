That all seems to work as intended.
However with NR_CPUS=8 SPLIT_PTLOCK_CPUS=4, enabling SLUB=y crashes the
machine early in boot.  
Too early for netconsole, no serial console.  Wedges up uselessly with
CONFIG_XMON=n, does mysterious repeated uncontrollable exceptions with
CONFIG_XMON=y.  This is all fairly typical for a powerpc/G5 crash :(
However I was able to glimpse some stuff as it flew past.  Crash started in
flush_old_exec and ended in pgtable_free_tlb -> kmem_cache_free.  I don't know
how to do better than that I'm afraid, unless I'm to hunt down a PCIE serial
card, perhaps.
