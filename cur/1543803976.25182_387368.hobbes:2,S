Hello,everyone!
Linux kernel provides vfs for the various physical filesystems.The
profit we get from the
VFS is just the standard interface it provides such as read and write?
Can we implement a user space filesystem which is actually a library?I
think it will be
faster than kernel space filesystem through the vfs layer.
Any suggestions or commnets?
Thank you!
