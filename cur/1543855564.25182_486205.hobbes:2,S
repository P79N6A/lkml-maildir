"mis-compiling" and "work around" are wrong words, the code had undefined
behavior (there is no sequence point between evaluation of ptr and
get_uleb128(&ptr, end) and ptr is modified twice, so the compiler can
evaluate it e.g. as:
temp = ptr;
temp = temp + get_uleb128(&ptr, end);
ptr = temp;
or
temp = get_uleb128(&ptr, end);
ptr += temp;
While gcc has some warnings for sequence point semantics violations
(-Wsequence-point), this can't be one of the cases at least until IPA moves
much further, because get_uleb128 might very well not modify the variable
and at that point the code would be ok).
