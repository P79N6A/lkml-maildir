It was I who put the BKL back into locks.c, much to
Matthew's disgust...
The problem was that replacing the BKL with a semaphore
seriously damaged Apache thoughput on 8-way.  Apache
was using flock()-based synchronisation and replacing
a spin with a schedule just killed it.
So.. Apache isn't doing that any more, but it is an
instructive case.  Replacing the BKL with a semaphore
can sometimes be a very bad thing.
