So pass in rdinit=/sbin/init.  (Back in 1997 you didn't have to 
specify "root=", you used rdev.)

The ramfs /init was "intended" to be the first process to run, which inherits 
PID 1 and thus all responsibility for further system setup.  You can't return 
back to the kernel from that, it panics if PID 1 exits.  Whether you choose 
to do "system setup" or keep running with rootfs as your root filesystem 
(very popular with embedded devices) is not the kernel's problem.
This has been documented and has worked fine for years.
Note that the initrd mechanism (which used to run /linuxrc) was _not_ PID 1, 
and expected you to return to the kernel.  That's one of the big improvements 
initramfs made over initrd.

That's policy, and none of the kernel's business.

You're mixing them in your head, and it sounds like you don't understand what 
it's doing.

Setting root= is not _used_ if initramfs triggers, because /init gets run 
before ever reaching that code.  In initramfs, the root filesystem is rootfs, 
and no attempt to mount anything else is made by the kernel unless userspace 
explicitly asks for it.  Userspace is welcome to mount anything it wants, and 
userspace can switch_root to it, but that's not the kernel's problem.

*shrug*  I was saying I can't really comment much on a subsystem I neither use 
nor see much point in.

Yeah, pretty much.  Then again I feel the same way about the Itanium, and try 
to stay out of the way of people who feel they do need it.

Which led to David Wheeler's "diverse double-compiling": 
http://www.dwheeler.com/trusting-trust/
Which led to rather a lot of patches being integrated into the tcc fork I 
maintain in my nonexistent free time, such as:

I'm all for a patch to make initramfs use tmpfs.  I'm kind of dubious about 
one coming from somebody who thinks that the initramfs interface in use by 
thousands of developers for years now needs to be totally rewritten as a 
prerequisite of doing so.

Do you mean if you program initramfs to parse the environment variable "root", 
or if you set rdinit=/nonexistent and fall back to the old root= code?

When I said the existing initramfs interface has been "in use by thousands of 
developers for years now", I wasn't speaking metaphorically.  I was speaking 
from personal experience.
Hi.  I used to maintain busybox, which is probably _the_ most widely used 
embedded Linux package.  I wrote the kernel's current 
Documentation/filesystems/ramfs-rootfs-initramfs.txt and some other random
documentation on initramfs (
http://linuxdevices.com/articles/AT4017834659.html
 
and 
http://www.timesys.com/timesource/initramfs.htm
).  I have personally 
taken apart a dozen or more different systems using "system-on-rootfs", and 
know _of_ over a hundred.  I can tell you the plusses and minuses of doing 
that vs jffs2 vs squashfs vs ext2.  Entire system generators like buildroot 
and uClinux create initramfs images by default.
This is why I'm fairly certain the current initramfs interface is usable by a 
large variety of people.

The way to specify a filesystem type to go with the mount "root=" does is 
actually "rootfstype=".  I use this when mounting a hostfs root for User Mode 
Linux, ala this woefully out of date document:
http://landley.net/writing/docs/UML.html
You don't specify a filesystem type for "root=", you specify a path there.

An option to removing the "root=" infrastructure that never gets reached if 
you use initramfs should save space, yes.  The other stuff you added just 
shows you don't seem to understand the existing, documented way to use 
initramfs.
