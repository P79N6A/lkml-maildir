Hi all,
When running a fairly CPU and thread-hungry application under 2.5.75, 
2.6.0-test1 and 2.6.0-test2 I'm getting the following error messages on the 
console:
Jul 25 00:16:31 durak kernel: CPU 0: Machine Check Exception: 0000000000000004
Jul 25 00:16:31 durak kernel: Bank 0: b600000000000175 at 0000000025a0cff8
Jul 25 00:16:31 durak kernel: Kernel panic: CPU context corrupt
Once I get this message, one of the threads becomes unkillable yet remains 
soaking up CPU cycles.
This does not happen in the 2.4 kernels. How do I go about finding the source 
of the problem? The address indicated in the second line indicates that this 
happened somewhere in userspace (0x25a0cff8), but since this is a commercial 
package I don't have any symbolic info. This last address changes between 
runs, so I assume it's a virtual address.
Any ideas welcome.
Best regards,
Ben
