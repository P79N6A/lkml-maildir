I agree, it's quite confusing. However, I don't think that the PCI spec
defines "PCI controller" or "PCI domain" terms, it's pretty much
implementation specific.
Assuming that each PCI controller can handle up to 256 bridged buses,
the unique PCI controller index and PCI bus number is all that userspace
needs to know in order to properly identify devices in the system.

It's somewhat similar to new alpha-ev7 systems: it can have 1 I/O
controller per CPU where each I/O controller has a 4x AGP bus and 3
PCI/PCI-X buses. However, each of these buses has its own address
space and IOMMU.
