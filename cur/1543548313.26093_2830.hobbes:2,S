Where is this patch? I can't find it in the archive on
http://boudicca.tux.org/hypermail/linux-kernel/
 , nor in my mailbox. In
fact, this "final fix" thread only consists of 2 answers, one by you and
one by Linus. Since I am getting these oopses from ll_rw_blk.c:716 and
buffer.c:730 all the time, I would be interested in any patch.
