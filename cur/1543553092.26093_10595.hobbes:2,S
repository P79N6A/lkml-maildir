Hi, Peter,
You can easily remove duplicates in object files without sorting. You
can just use a shell written function.
This is an example of such function (bash written).
It removes the duplicates from the argument and prints the result to
stdout.
No sorting used.
# This function removes duplicates from a string
remove_duplicates() {
 if [ $# -ne 1 ]; then
  echo "usage: remove_duplicates string" 1>&2
  exit 1
 fi
 str=""
 for tmpvar1 in $1 ; do
  flag_found=0
  for tmpvar2 in $str ; do
   if [ "${tmpvar1}" = "${tmpvar2}" ]; then
    flag_found=1
    break
   fi
  done
  if [ "${flag_found}" -eq 0 ]; then
    str="${str} ${tmpvar1}"
  fi
 done
 echo "${str}"
 return 0
}
# This is a usage example.
x="`remove_duplicates \"a b c d e a b c\"`"
echo "$x"
