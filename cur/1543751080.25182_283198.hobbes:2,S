Documentation/CodingStyle is well worth a read. Also for that matter
just reading a lot of good code helps you write good code as reading
helps you learn a language better.
Efficiency is a harder subject: Remember that efficient code still must
be easy to understand so often is about algorithms not language, and in
part about hardware.
On the hardware side - the book "Unix systems for modern architectures"
But as Tim righly said "practice"
