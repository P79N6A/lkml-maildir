I'll preface this saying I'm a kernel compile newbie and I could be making
the most basic of mistakes.
My problem is that I have an Asus CUSL2 board and am attempting to use the
Intel i815-based on-board video.  I'm on Redhat 7.0, which works great with
the stock 2.2.16-22 kernel.
I am able to compile and boot a 2.4.0-test10 kernel for text only.  The
problem is that to use the on-board video of the i810/i815 board, you have
to have agpgart -- but when I try to turn CONFIG_AGP=y in the .config the
2.4.0-test11-pre4 compile fails on agpsupport.c:35
I've found many references to similar problems in prior test builds, but I
thought this was already patched?  There linux-kernel mailing list archives
had a lengthy discussion about other .config setting dependencies, but I
couldn't find the "final word" on this issue.
I have documented the EXACT procedure I use to build my kernel.  For every
attempt, I start with a DELETED /usr/src/linux/ tree and all fresh files
from the downloaded tarball.  My steps are documented at:

Any help appreciated.  Feel free to keep replies off the main list, as this
may be a training issue more than a kernel one :)
Thanks.
