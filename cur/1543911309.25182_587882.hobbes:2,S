Abuse, probably not (if a thing is required on one system and must
not be on another, it has to be configurable). If the printk is
a good idea... IMHO hardly, at best. We don't warn about trying to
write to /vmlinuz after all.
ulimit/pam_limits should fix the (IMHO nonexistent) problem nicely.
One has to plug all the holes, though (e.g. $HOME/.forward).
