We don't need that, it's perfectly ok if start is called but end is
not, it's ok to unregister in the middle as I guarantee ->release is
called before mmu_notifier_unregister returns (if ->release is needed
at all, not the case for KVM/GRU).
Unregister is already solved with srcu/rcu without any additional
complication as we don't need the guarantee that for each start an end
will be called.

The only reason mm_lock() was introduced is to solve "register", to
guarantee that for each end there was a start. We can't handle end
called without start in the driver.
The reason the driver must be prevented to register in the middle of
start/end, if that if it ever happens the driver has no way to know it
must stop the secondary mmu page faults to call get_user_pages and
instantiate sptes/secondarytlbs on pages that will be freed as soon as
zap_page_range starts.
