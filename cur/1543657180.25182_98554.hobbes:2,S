    As a followup to this, taking it off RAID has greatly helped
stability, but not completely cured it, as I've managed to get another
hard lock while doing a 2GB or so rsync.  It seems to be fine for
normal use, though, and I'm now contemplating turning RAID back on to
see if it stays stable for anything except large file transfers.
