Hi Ingo
As we pass same flags from glibc to kernel we thought it will be good to 
have defines in one place to avoid going out of sync in future.
glibc already has dependency on kernel headers. So were looking for ways 
to fix futex.h in kernel so that glibc can use it. But if it is not 
feasible then we can define these flags inside glibc headers. Only 
additional burden will be that these headers will be required to be 
synced whenever there is any change pertaining to them(mostly the defines.)
Thanks
Khem
