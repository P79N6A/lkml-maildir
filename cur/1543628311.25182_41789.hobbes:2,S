All you need to do is save the starting and ending cset revs as keys,
and then send those into bk export -tpatch.  So a trigger which saved
top of trunk on a stack is all you need, the rest is a tiny amount of
perl/shell.  Write it, send it to me, if people like it, we'll roll it
into the mainline release.
