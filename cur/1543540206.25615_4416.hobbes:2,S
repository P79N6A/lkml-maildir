Subject: help, custom filesystem inode_operations->mkdir is not executing!

folks,
This is targeted at all the filesystem/VFS experts out there...
I am developing a file system and have have a filesystem with inode, super,
file operations defined.  The filesystem works for lookup/readdir
interfaces.  As an example, I can execute ls, ls -l, cd operations from the
shell on the fs...
When tracing through the linux kernel, I have found that
inode_operations->lookup is called before mkdir is called for all
filesystems (to ensure the name identifier doesn't exist I guess?).  Then
the mkdir interface is executed.  
I created a lookup routine that has the following algorithm:
if file does not exist
	return 0
else if file exists
	create inode structure and read it from media
	d_add (entry, inode)
	return 0
The system should execute a lookup, then a mkdir operation if the file does
not exist.  Unfortunately, my lookup routine is being called in a mkdir
system call, but the mkdir interface is not executed.  I also know that
upper layer mkdir is not being called (I placed printks in functions above,
executes for ext2, but not for my custom fs).
I am assuming this is because I am missing something in my lookup operation,
although I am not really sure at this point...
Any ideas?
	Regards,
	-steve
