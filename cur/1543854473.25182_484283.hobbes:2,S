# mount | grep vfat 
/dev/sdb1 on /mnt/iomega type vfat (rw,uid=1000,gid=100,codepage=850,iocharset=iso8859-15) 
it seems only related to those kind of files, but I don't know how to inspect the "file properties" and why these files behave like this.
As you can see and with a strace made on cp, the files _seems_ to be copied with the correct case, whilst it isn't, as seen with "ls". This and other things let me think is a vfat problem.
