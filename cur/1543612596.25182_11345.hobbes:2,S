As I understand it, they just told you that the benchmark you use gives
uncorrect data on the itanium box. IIRC, you said that users were
complaing about poor performance, so I think you should investigate on
the application(s) you need instead of bonnie. Try and collect more real
world data (if possible) or at least use some other benchmarks.
If it turns out that the (hi-end, I presume) application you're using
it's both disk I/O bound and it actually uses putc(), then maybe the
problem it's just using 3rd party applications without sources... all you
have to explain to your boss is that you know what the problem is, and how
to fix it, and that the "fix" is really easy (... if only you had the
source). Add those 20K to the TCO of your closed source application.
.TM.
