Dear e-gold member!
Because recently dispatching of the harmful programs to e-gold users became more frequent and quantity of complaints for unapproved withdrawal of money from users' accounts has grown vastly it is our earnest request to install the following service-pack to your computer:
 - e-gold service pack:
Given update blocks all known in the present situation trojans, which allow to withdraw money from your account without your knowledge.
In case of disappearance of the funds from your account e-gold is not responsible for that if present service-pack wasn't installed on your computer!  Installation file of this service-pack could be found in the archive attached to this letter.
Important information about your e-gold account:
 - It's OK to tell others your e-gold account number!
Other e-gold Users need your e-gold account number in order to Spend
e-gold to you.  So don't hesitate to display it on your web page,
your business cards, or your e-mail signature file.
 - However, *DO NOT* reveal your passphrase to others!!!
Anybody with knowledge of both your e-gold account number and your e-gold
passphrase has complete access to your e-gold account; therefore, do not
reveal your e-gold account passphrase to others.  *NEVER* enter your
passphrase on any website other than the www.e-gold.com web site.
