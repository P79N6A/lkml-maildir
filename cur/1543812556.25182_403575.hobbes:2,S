As reported yesterday [1], the generic irq framework for alpha introduced
in commit 0595bf3bca9d9932a05b06dd438f40f01d27cd33 kills my box under
fairly heavy disk usage. I got a md raid 0 array stripped accross 3 scsi
disks and any kind of relatively intensive IOs (like md5sum or sha1sum
against iso files) kill the box immediately; either it panics in
kernel/exit.c:do_exit - the first three "unlikely" - or in
arch/alpha/mm/fault.c:do_page_fault "Unable to handle paging reguest at
some address"...
Reverting it makes the box stable again (as it was under vanilla 2.6.15).
Here's the commit detail:
0595bf3bca9d9932a05b06dd438f40f01d27cd33 is first bad commit
