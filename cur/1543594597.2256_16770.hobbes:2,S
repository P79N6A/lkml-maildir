Huh? The BKL will protect against other operations which might cause
the devfs entry to be unregistered, where those other operations also
grab the BKL. So, it's an improvement.
Sure, some operations may cause unregistration without grabbing the
BKL, but that's orthogonal (and requires more extensive changes). If
this "widening" is of no use, then what use are the existing grabs of
the BKL in those functions? You're the one who added them in the first
place.
