That's why you introduce an infrastructure that hides all the nitty-gritty 
plumbing, and makes it easy to use.

Personal attacks are really rather unhelpful/unscientific.

What's probably true is that, for a kernel to stay competitive you need two 
distinct traits:
1. Stability
2. Performance
And you can't get that, by arguing that the kernel development community 
doesn't have the brains to code for performance, which I dearly doubt.
So, instead of using intimidating language to force one's opinion thru, 
especially when it comes from those in control, why not have a democratic 
vote?
Thanks!
