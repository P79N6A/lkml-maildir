Huh?  /dev/usb/hiddev0 is major 180, minor 96.  So the kernel asked for
minor 96 and it got it.  Why are you trying to connect to minor number
192?
For a list of the USB minor numbers see:
	
http://www.linux-usb.org/usb.devices.txt
It's a bit different from Documentation/devices.txt, I need to send the
updates to lanana.org someday...
thanks,
