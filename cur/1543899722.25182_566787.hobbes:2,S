As Andi seemed to imply I don't even think cmpxchg is faster than
interrupt enable/disable on current generation AMD x86_64 chips, so
are you targetting this optimization solely at Intel x86 Core Duo
32-bit chips?  That's the only one I can see which will benefit from
this.  Are you going to probe the cpu sub-type and patch SLUB?
I really don't think this optimization is wise as even if you
could decide at build time, it's going to be a maintainence and
debugging nightmare to have to field bug reports given two different
locking schemes.
Please reconsider this change, thanks.
