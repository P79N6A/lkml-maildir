Hm...  I don't agree much with the virtual relay device solution.
I once experimentally implemented an ALSA-OSS virtual kernel driver.
But, it just gives more complexity.
Yes, the library solution has merits and demerits.  The library should
have been differently designed.  But, I don't think the virtual relay
is the best solution just because you can use a bare kernel
interface...
