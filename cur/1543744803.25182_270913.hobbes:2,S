Stupid, stupid, stupid....
....I forgot mrproper. I'm so used to not having to use it that I
forgot. /me feels like an idiot. That said, the stock kernel should
have recognized my USB devices, LCD resolution, and touchpad like RH
9.0 did without having to re-compile (but that's RH's problem, not
this list).
I still have some warnings when it boots about missing modules
(char_major_xxx), but I'm sure I can fix that.
Now my only issue is why Doom 3 runs at a snail's pace now, but then
running games isn't that important in the larger scheme of things.
