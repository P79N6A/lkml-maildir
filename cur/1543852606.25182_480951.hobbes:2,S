Subject: [PATCH] x86_64: Fix partial page check to ensure unusable memory is not being marked usable.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Fix partial page check in e820_register_active_regions to ensure
partial pages are
not being marked as active in the memory pool.
Signed-off-by: Aaron Durbin <adurbin@google.com>

This was causing a machine to reboot w/ an area in the e820 that was less
than the page size because the upper address was being use to mark a hole as
active in the memory pool.
