This works and the system is designed this way.  But it's unlikely
that any distribution will ship code like this since the maintenance
is to problematic.

Wrong.  Linus is right, we jump over lock prefix.  After a lot of
benchmarking I found this to be the fastest was and the Intel people
seemed to agree.

This would require that potentially every single DSO is duplicated as
threaded and non-threaded.  If you like this you might as well enter
the horror world of BSD with their libc_r.  This will never fly, the
support costs are too high.

It really not and the number using them is growing.
