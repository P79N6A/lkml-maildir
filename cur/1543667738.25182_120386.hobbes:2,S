Hi,
I'm trying to run the ephttpd 2.0 server on a PII with a 2.4.19 kernel 
patched with /dev/epoll.  But I have trouble with the coro ( C 
couroutine ) library.  The server always does a segmentation fault when 
the function dph_exit_conn() calls co_exit(0). It's the fatal() function 
that generates this segmentation fault. Plus, this fault is 
automatically generated each time there is no more requests on a 
connection and that dph_httpd() calls dph_exit_conn().
I would like to know of you ever had this kind of problem and how you 
solved it. The version of coro I use is the 1.1.0-pre2. I need this http 
server to rebuild /dev/epoll tests on my computer for reference results.
