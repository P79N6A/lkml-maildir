EEEEEwwww!  Cordic is UGLY!  There is a reason that Intel & we (AMD) have
gone with polyonmial & rational function approximations.  BTW, our
algorithms are quite accurate.  If you are running in another world, or just
want to emulate, look into equal-ripple approximations.  You will chew some
serious processor power finding good functions, but what you get can be
nice.
