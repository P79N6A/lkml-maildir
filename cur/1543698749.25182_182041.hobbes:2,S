This was indeed one of the worries that people had a long time ago, and is
one (but only one) of the reasons for the addition of the clarification to
the COPYING file for the kernel.
So I agree with you from a technical standpoint, and I claim that the
clarification in COPYING about user space usage through normal system
calls covers that special case.
But at the same time I do want to say that I discourage use of the kernel
header files for user programs for _other_ reasons (ie for the last 8
years or so, the suggestion has been to have a separate copy of the header
files for the user space library). But that's due to technical issues
(since I think the language of the COPYING file takes care of all
copyright issues): trying to avoid version dependencies.

And this is an area where I think the GPL just isn't the right license to
use - but on the other hand it obviously isn't my decision to make. I'm
not touching Cygwin with a ten-foot pole, and that has nothing to do with
licensing ;)
The GPL just doesn't make a lot of sense for library-like infrastructure.
