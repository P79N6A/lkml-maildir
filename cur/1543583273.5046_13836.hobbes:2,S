"nice" bios ... :-/
so now pray, that your hardware configuration allows a second boot
without being reset. (yes, this is the downside of qreboot).
to make it work always, we would need a "deep" reset of at least the 
pci and isa-pnp busses, presumably a chipset reset. sadly, i have
no idea, how to do this. possibly this would require an additional
reset function for every chipset. anyone can add something useful here?
best regards
