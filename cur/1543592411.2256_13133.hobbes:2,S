Allocating a buffer head during out of memory is always been deadlock
prone, 2.2 always had the same problem too. I'm not sure why you are
telling me this, I didn't changed anything that happens to be in the
swapout path (besides removing the deadlock in create_bounces with
evolution of first Ingo's patch but that is not specific to the
swapout). I only changed the getblk path (which is not used by the
swapout, at least unless you swapout on a file not on a blkdev, but even
in that case the change is fine).
About yelding interally to alloc_pages it would make sense if we
had a private pool internally to the allocator, otherwise with current
code you definitely want to return a faliure fast to the caller so the
caller will try the private pool before the yield.
btw in the below patch __GFP_FAIL is a noop.
