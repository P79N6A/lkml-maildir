the open export lacks some granular information this is a fact. that's
fine with me though.

I think it's reasonable to write an automated tool that generates all
the granular info for the big merges by doing a lookup on the web for
every single bkcvs changeset, I did something similar already but I
missed the linearization of bkcvs, not maybe it could have a chance to
work. But the last time I attempted to use the web as a "fetch" tool,
not as a "browsing tool with a browser with an human behind" you said if
we would use it that way you would shut it down, that doesn't match my
definition of interoperability or availability very well.

that's an enterely different issue, don't mix things up. That loses
*tons* of information, much more than bkcvs, I'm not even considering
it. that's only useful to projects where the developers don't even
supply tarballs and patches anymore if I understood correctly. On the
kernel we've the bkcvs that doesn't lose that much of information, so I
don't see any use for this tool on the kernel side.
