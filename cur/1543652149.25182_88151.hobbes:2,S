Err I made the ck patchset so I think I should know. ck9 came only as one 
patch which included O(1),Low Latency, Preempt, Compressed Caching, 
Supermount, ALSA and XFS. CK10-13 on the otherhand had optional Compressed 
Caching OR AA OR Rmap. By default since they are 2.4 kernels they all include 
the vanilla aa vm, but the ck trunk with AA has the extra AA vm addons only 
available in the -AA kernel set. If you disabled compressed caching in ck9 
you got only the vanilla 2.4.19 vm.
