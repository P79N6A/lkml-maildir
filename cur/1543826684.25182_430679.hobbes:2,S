Sorry for the confusion.

My main concern is write speed and here these patches help a lot. I have
not tested it, but I think this brings ext3 performance to that of ext2.

Just to ensure that I understand this correctly. The on-disk format is not
final and it will still change. This means if I use it now I will have
to reformat the disk when ever the format is changed.
As you mention e2fsprogs also needs to be updated:
    # dumpe2fs -h /dev/md7
    dumpe2fs 1.38 (30-Jun-2005)
    dumpe2fs: Filesystem has unsupported feature(s) while trying to open /dev/md7
    Couldn't find valid filesystem superblock.
Are there any patches down loadable, that add support to the e2fsprogs?
It would really be nice if consensus about the extents on-disk format
could be reached, so more people could benefit from it. Asking when this
will be reached, does not make sense?
Thanks,
Holger
