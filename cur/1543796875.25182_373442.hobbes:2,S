Yes, but there isn't and won't be much recognition - every company does its own
thing. And how many people buy online all the time? But even then, a genery
"runs with Linux" Logo would be great. If a company's product is not certified,
its not considered by Linux customers. 
Also you could hold up figures from certified hardware to impress and argue
against companies that think there is no real market for Linux.
There needs to be a way to breack out of the chicken and egg problem - no linux
market, no linux hardware.
Corporate Customers can afford to do research, expert staff does the buying. But
the average homeuser? He needs a generic sign, as simple as that.
