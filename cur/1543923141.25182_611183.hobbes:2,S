I also had to specify "-lpci" on Mandrake 10.1, "-lpci -lz" on Gentoo.

These are both VT6306, one on the motherboard and one on a PCI card.

The "rev 80" chip is a VT6307 on the motherboard.

The "rev 46" chip is on a CardBus card.  So far I believed it to be a
VT6306 but I can't easily open the card's casing...

I haven't tried it yet.
