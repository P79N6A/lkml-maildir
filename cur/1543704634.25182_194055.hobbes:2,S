I think it mostly does a good job at making sure to only take
online cpus into account. If there are places where it doesn't
then it shouldn't be too hard to fix.

I guess so, but you'd still need NR_CPUS to be >= that arbitrary
number.

Well this would be the problem. I guess its quite possible that
one doesn't know the topology of newly added CPUs before hand.
Well OK, this would require a per architecture function to handle
CPU hotplug. It could possibly just default to arch_init_sched_domains,
and just completely reinitialise everything which would be the simplest.
