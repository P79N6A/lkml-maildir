	Hi,
	After sending you bogus path and bogus bug reports, I though
it would be time to send you a *real* patch.
	Patch below allow to set "uart=none", which is necessary for
FIR hardware. Patch for 2.5.31.

----------------------------------------------
	Regarding the initial bug I reported.
	The write is comming from the PPP line discipline. If PPP
can't transmit the data, it just drops it and assume higher layers
will retry. This is true for TCP, but not for "chat".
	I implemented the workaround, and the user report that it has
fixed his problem.
	I've also found a bunch of other bugs related to that in the
process, but I'll spare you the details.
	Have fun...
	Jean
