A trivial nit:
The cleanup ignores the return of sysfs_addrm_finish() -- functions
such as those could and should be void-returning. It doesn't even
need to return an int for success / failure ... I went over it's code,
and it's obvious that the function just never fails!
Returning the count of objects actually added / removed is quite
redundant too, because we return "actx->cnt" unconditionally
from inside it, and the caller can know that anyway, without
even calling it. Also, note that nowhere in the present code is
the return of that function ever being used in that sense (i.e. as
a "count") anyway ...
So: best to just make it void-returning. That's what it is.
