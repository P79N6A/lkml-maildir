If you're a dumb slave off a smart head-end, the sysadmin has already solved
the problem of getting files from the outside to the dumb slave, just for their
own sanity in pushing patches and *other* config file updates.
And if you're *not* getting updates pushed to you for all the *other* stuff,
the leapseconds is probably the least of your worries.
