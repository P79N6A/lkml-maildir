Alan,
Here is some code from a video driver.
static int vino_mmap(struct file *file, struct vm_area_struct *vma)
{
	struct video_device *dev = video_devdata(file);
	struct vino_device *v = dev->priv;
	unsigned long start = vma->vm_start;
	unsigned long size  = vma->vm_end - vma->vm_start;
	int i, err = 0;
	if (down_interruptible(&v->sem))
		return -EINTR;
	if (size > v->page_count * PAGE_SIZE) {
		err = -EINVAL;
		goto out;
	}
	for (i = 0; i < v->page_count; i++) {
		unsigned long page = virt_to_phys((void *)v->desc[i]);
		if (remap_page_range(start, page, PAGE_SIZE, PAGE_READONLY)) {
			err = -EAGAIN;
			goto out;
		}
		start += PAGE_SIZE;
		if (size <= PAGE_SIZE) break;
		size -= PAGE_SIZE;
	}
out:
	up(&v->sem);
	return err;
}
I deliberately used this as a sample so you can't say what
you usually say... Anyway are you aware that ...
	unsigned long size  = vma->vm_end - vma->vm_start;
... ends up being 32 bytes longer than the length the user-mode
code put into mmap()?
That's why I use a driver ioctl() to return the physical address
and the length so user-mode code can mmap() without the hassle
of "optimizations" (read kernel bugs) mucking with buffers,
especially those then end up overlapping because of bugs like
above.
Now, if somebody is having trouble with mmap(), it is quite
a bit better I believe, to reduce the basic user-mode mem-mapping
to its lowest common denominator. Therefore, I showed what was
guaranteed to work.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
