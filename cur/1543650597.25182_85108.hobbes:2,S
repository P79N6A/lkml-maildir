I teach Linux classes to corporate IT guys (~300 or so this year) and
many of them are migrating from Solaris or deploying Linux along side
Solaris.
Solaris has had ACLs since 2.5.1 (1996), and EAs since 2.9 (May 2002).
Having ACL in Linux is a VERY COMMON REQUEST that I hear from the
students.
FWIW.
