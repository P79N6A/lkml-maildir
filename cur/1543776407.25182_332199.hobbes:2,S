Hi all,
Nice to see this going into the kernel :)

This is not perfectly correct, the PowerBook5,6 is afaik only the 15"
model, the 12" and 17" have other numbers. Maybe you should just leave
that out, likewise in the code/Kconfig file.

I think that is misleading, those sensors don't even exist on 12" and
15" powerbooks. Maybe it should say 'Note that only 16 instead of 26
sensors exist on 12" and 15" models'
