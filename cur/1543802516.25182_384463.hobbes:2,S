Hey Roman, sorry for the slow response, but I've been busy since getting
back from the holiday.
Initially when I wrote this I was hoping to prod Ulrich into updating
and sending his PPS driver for inclusion. But I believe he has just been
too busy, so pulling this code is probably the right thing.

I do hope someone interested in PPS drivers will re-add the support code
along with a driver that utilizes the interface at some point.
thanks
