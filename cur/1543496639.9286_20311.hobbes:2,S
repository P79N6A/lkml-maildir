Which means that even with capabilites, you must still think about which
programs you want to give privileges.

Yes, but this is almost the same as doing this:
  char buffer[1024];
  sprintf(&buffer, "%s %s %s %s", argv[1], argv[2], argv[3], argv[4]);
It is just plain wrong, and that program should not be given permissions.
And if a user insists on running it, the user should not be given
permissions as well. :-)

SIGCAP should be catchable IMHO. A program should be able to articulate
why it doesn't work (I've spent the WE debugging lpd, it has useful
debugging messages as "Job transfer failed" even with -D10.)
