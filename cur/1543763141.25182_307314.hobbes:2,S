We went over this stuff when we first started using the
Intel 486. (Ref Intel 486 Microprocessor Programmers
reference manual, ISBN 1-55512-192-4)
Segment registers are really 32 bits in length. They
have a 'visible' part and an invisible part. The
visible part contains the 16-bit selector. The
invisible part contains the base address, limit,
etc., that was loaded from the GDT or the LDT.
(Ref. pp 5-9)
All access to these registers is 32 bits. If you
execute	'push ds' or 'pop ds' the stack-pointer
will move 4 bytes. An 0x66 override prefix is
ignored when accessing segment registers. It
should never be used. There is another override
prefix that can be used instead. The push ds
opcode is 0x1e and the pop ds opcode is 0x1f
if somebody wants to experiment.
Even a move from a CPU general purpose register
to a segment register is a 32-bit operation. If
you want to move the contents of a segment register
to memory or a register as a 16-bit action, for
instance not overwriting the high-word of a register,
the override prefix is 0x67, not 0x66. (Ref. pp 26-210)
This means that segment values stored in memory 
should really be aligned on 32-bit boundaries
so that extra clock-cycles are not wasted
accessing these registers. This also means
that they should be treated as (Posix) uint32_t
not uint16_t, even though the value will never
exceed 8192.
So if there are any "movw (mem), %ds" and
"movw %ds, (mem)" in the code. The sizeof(mem)
needs to be 32-bits and the 'w' needs to be removed.
Otherwise, we are wasting CPU cycles and/or fooling
ourselves. GAS needs to continue to generate whatever
it was fed, with appropriate diagnostics if it
is fed the wrong stuff.
