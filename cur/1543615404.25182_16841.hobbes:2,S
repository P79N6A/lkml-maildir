The double sync is because traditionally, sync was asyncronous-
it told the kernel 'flush write cache to disk' but it returned
immidiately. That is why people were told to sync 3 times - by
the time you had typed 'sync' for the third time on your 300 baud
lineprinter console the system was done flushing.
sync;sync;sync;reboot is NOT what was used, it was:
# sync
# sync
# sync
# reboot
Anyway, Linux sync is different. It *is* synchronous. However syncing
and then doing a hard reboot is not recommended, you really need to
unmount all filesystems first, and remount root read-only. The
standard shutdown sequence does all of this for you and typing sync
before shutdown -r now is completely useless.

If you're going to halt or reboot a system *hard* by using the reset
button or <stop>-a without calling shutdown you better sync before
you do that yes, and then you're still not guaranteed free of fs
corruption - at least kill all processes first to prevent some
process writing to disk in between the sync and the halt/reset.
