Mmm, ...
So what is the best place to look at if one wants to do some driver work. Not
that i really have that much time, but i may look into porting the pm3fb
driver to the new scheme, but ruby + 2.5.1 hangs hopelessly for me, and if it
is not the latest stuff around, it would not be the best place to work from.
Also, i suppose there is no documentation whatsoever yet, apart from the
source and the mailing list archive here ?
