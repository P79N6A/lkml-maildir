It's certainly not a bad idea - maybe if we put it right next to the
stupid google ad it would make it return something that made sense
instead of the very hardware we are telling people to avoid.
On the other hand, the site and ads are not something I'm doing to get
rich, so I'd rather avoid even giving the impression of impropriety.
Thanks for adding the card!
