I'm getting a bit fed up of all the wrong information that's flying
around in this thread. If people aren't absolutely sure and can't
quote chapter and verse then they should keep out of it.
Section 6.5.2.1 of the ANSI/ISO 9899-1990 standard says:
    Within a structure object, the non-bit-field members and the
    units within which bit-fields reside have addresses that
    increase in the order in which they are declared.
This specifically means that the fields above must appear in the order
one, two, three, four and can't be re-ordered. It goes on to say:
    A pointer to a structure object, suitable converted, points to its
    initial member (or if that member is a bit-field, then to the unit
    in which it resides), and vice versa. There may therefore be
    unnamed padding within a structure object, but not at its
    beginning, as necessary to achieve the appropriate alignment.
This means that, contrary to what you claim, the condition
     foo.one == (*(char *)&foo);
is indeed guaranteed to hold.
