Oh, that's I agree (about the implentation beeing maybe sub-optimal),
especially the possibility to avoid the lock...

None of the affected setups has something as broken-by-design as SMM

Yah, we alraedy have a lock in the config space code, so I think the
solution here is to avoid the double locks by doing things a bit
differently.

I don't understand your statements above.
