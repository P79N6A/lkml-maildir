~10 people bothered to report this on LKML -- and there could easily have
been others who didn't, and simply switched to -rc4. And then many more
might've hit it, foudn this thread immediately (like you did), and hence
didn't report again ... so I still pretty much stand by what I'd said :-)
But in any case as you said it's fixed already so no bother.
