It's not intended to work precisely, it's intended to give a good estimate 
of task memory footprint.  There are several different scenarios that can 
interfere with getting a precise measurement via this method; then again 
/proc/pid/smaps is so expensive already because of the iteration through 
VMA's that it's not something you'd do regularly.
Any other suggestions on how to obtain this data is certainly welcome.

Is there an update on Paul Davies' implementation that would allow us to 
iterate through a set of pte's in a vm_area_struct range?

Sure, but that's beyond the scope of this patchset.  My intention in 
extracting away a new pte_walker was to prevent having two identical 
implementations and it could easily be extracted even further to lib for 
the ioremap case that Paul mentioned.
