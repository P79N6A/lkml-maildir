Hi Andrew,
Not exactly : the increment operation is atomic, but not the selection of the
local variable. local_inc(&__get_cpu_var()) implies the following sequence 
of operations :
1 - Get the variable copy corresponding to the currently running CPU.
2 - atomically increment the variable.
It would be wrong to be scheduled on another CPU between 1 and 2, because the
atomic increment should only be done by the CPU "owner" of the local variable,
as the local atomic increment is not atomic wrt other CPUs.
