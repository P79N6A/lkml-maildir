  Does a 2.4.21-pre3 kernel work?

  I've seen this as well when I attempted to upgrade a system with 2 
raid0, and 1 raid1 devices.  It was a Intel se7500wv, 4G memory, and two 
3ware  7500-8.  The system works just fine with old aa's, and redhat's 
2.4.18-19 kernel.  I didn't have much time to spend with it, and I was 
waiting to test 2.4.21-pre3 before reporting the bug.
