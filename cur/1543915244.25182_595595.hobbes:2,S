In nbd-server, there's no dlopen(), and I do not currently plan to add
that. Are there problems with using libraries that are sharedly linked
at compile time that I'm not aware of?
There are plans to add the possibility for shell script callouts, but
those would always be optional. I see no reason why we couldn't make any
mlockall() call an option, too; preferably one that would be
incompatible with the shell script callout stuff.

I'm currently using glib because I wanted some utility functions that it
provides, and since I already knew glib; to me, it feels stupid to
reimplement the same things over and over again if there are libraries
that provide them.
If using glib is problematic for whatever reason, I'll certainly be
willing to switch to "something else"; I just didn't feel like
reinventing the wheel for no particular reason.

Would having the server use O_DIRECT help here? I would think that it
would avoid it marking pages as dirty, but I'm not very familiar with
the in-kernel bits.
