I'm facing a similar problem with the "Qoder" barcode scanner. I have to
have a keyboard hook. The "right" way seem to be to use the input api.
Unfortunately, this means that current kernels can't use the driver w/o
a patch (the input api patch). The ugly way is to patch the keyboard
driver. I'm doing both.
However, I wrote a REALLY SIMPLE hook tht supported exactly my needs,
since it's in the category of "ugly hack waiting for input api." Maybe
I'll write a version for your hook.
I wonder when the input api stuff for ps/2 devices will be a part of the
mainstream kernel...
