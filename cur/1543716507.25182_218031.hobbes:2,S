Yeah, there's a few special calls that need more than just a simple 
C-level call. kernel_thread() and execve() ends up being the main ones, I 
think.
On alpha, you could never do the "system call from kernel space" thing in
the first place, so alpha has always just open-coded the things rather
than play games with the "legacy way". Not hugely difficult, at most it
requires one or two assembler wrappers for those special calls that want a
"struct pt_regs" thing passed into them.
