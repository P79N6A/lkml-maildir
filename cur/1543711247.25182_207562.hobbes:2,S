oh, sorry, maybe i forgot to tell you that it has been already there

this will show the stacktrace when a buffer overrun/underrun is
detected in the irq handler.  it's not perfect, though.
we can add stacktracing in other nasty places, e.g. when the
unexpected h/w pointer is returned (this is usually because of sloppy
irq handling).
