Yes, that is quite a long time.  How long does it take in the airo
driver?  If it's possible to speed up the orinoco.c interrupt handler,
rather than moving stuff into a BH I'd prefer to do that.
It's possible the Cisco cards are just faster, although I would have
thought it a bit unlikely, since I beleive the recent Cisco's are
based on the same MAC controller as the Lucent and Intersil cards (but
different firmware).

Yes, it's possible.  It adds significant complexity though, so I'd
really prefer not to.
