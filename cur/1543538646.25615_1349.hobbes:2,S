Please HELP !!!
Somebody subscribed me at this mailing list with the login 
benard_b@epita.fr
The problem is when i send a mail out, benard_b@epita.fr
 is transformed to benoit.benard@epita.fr
So, when I sent a mail to majordomo@vger.rutgers.edu, it can't
unsubscribe me because  it don't know benoit.benard@epita.fr
If someone can help me or unsubscribe me, it will be great ...
thank
