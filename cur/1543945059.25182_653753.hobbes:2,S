The ability to have a daemon handle mounting onto a directory that only
exists in another process's private namespace.
Say I'm running in my private namespace that contains paths that are not
shared by the trusted 'init' namespace. If I were to step on an
autofs-like trap, I'd like for the kernel to be able to notify the
automounter that is running in the trusted namespace set up by 'init',
and have it mount the directory onto my namespace. This should happen
even if the path is not shared.
With mountat() the kernel can still pass the necessary information to
the automounter by giving it a directory file descriptor 'fd' that
points to the directory on top of which it wants the mount to occur.
Then automounter then executes
     mountat(AT_FDCWD, dev_name, fd, '.', type, flags, data);
and hey presto, the magic occurs.
