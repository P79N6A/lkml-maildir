fbdev ignoramus asks: isn't this pretty risky?  People who were previously
relying upon (or at least using) the kernel's default resolution will find
their displays coming up in a quite different resolution.
This change seems to be quite unrelated to the uvesafb stuff and should be
in a separate patch from the export, which _is_ uvesafb-related.  I think. 
If that's wrong then the changelog could do with some attention.
