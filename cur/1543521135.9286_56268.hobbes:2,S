Its up to stdint.h to provide you correct typedefs for int8_t, int16_t,
int32_t, int64_t. E.g. with gcc, it is easy,
e.g. on archs with char type 8bit large with
typedef int int32_t __attribute__((mode (SI)));
even if int is 64bit as well as long,
and I think other compilers have their ways of doing something similar as
well.
128bit long long is very uncommon these days on the other side, even on
64bit architectures.
Cheers,
