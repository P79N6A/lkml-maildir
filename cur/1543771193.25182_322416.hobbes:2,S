You might have missed in my earlier mail as
this is a not an MP kernel ie: !CONFIG_SMP
The synchronous timer delete primitives don't
exist in this configuration:
include/linux/timer.h:
#ifdef CONFIG_SMP
   extern int del_timer_sync(struct timer_list *timer);
   extern int del_singleshot_timer_sync(struct timer_list *timer);
#else
# define del_timer_sync(t) del_timer(t)
# define del_singleshot_timer_sync(t) del_timer(t)
#endif
BTW, I don't know if you happened on the mail I sent
yesterday.  It details rpc_run_timer() waking up an
application task blocked in call_transmit().  The
app task preempts ksoftirqd and eventually does a
__rpc_sleep_on()/__mod_timer() which requeues the
timer in the cascade.  When ksoftirqd/rpc_run_timer()
resumes RPC_TASK_HAS_TIMER is unconditionally cleared
however the timer is queued in the cascade.  This
appears to be at least one cause of the timer cascade
corruption I've seen.
