Subject: [PATCH 1/6] ext2 balloc: fix _with_rsv freeze
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

After several days of testing ext2 with reservations, it got caught inside
ext2_try_to_allocate_with_rsv: alloc_new_reservation repeatedly succeeding
on the window [12cff,12d0e], ext2_try_to_allocate repeatedly failing to
find the free block guaranteed to be included (unless there's contention).
Fix the range to find_next_usable_block's memscan: the scan from "here"
(0xcfe) up to (but excluding) "maxblocks" (0xd0e) needs to scan 3 bytes
not 2 (the relevant bytes of bitmap in this case being f7 df ff - none
00, but the premature cutoff implying that the last was found 00).
Is this a problem for mainline ext2?  No, because the "size" in its memscan
is always EXT2_BLOCKS_PER_GROUP(sb), which mkfs.ext2 requires to be a
multiple of 8.  Is this a problem for ext3 or ext4?  No, because they have
an additional extN_test_allocatable test which rescues them from the error.

But the bigger question is, why does the my_rsv case come here to
find_next_usable_block at all?  Doesn't its 64-bit boundary limit, and its
memscan, blithely ignore what the reservation prepared?  It's messy too,
the complement of the memscan being that "i < 7" loop over in
ext2_try_to_allocate.  I think this ought to be cleaned up,
in ext2+reservations and ext3 and ext4.
