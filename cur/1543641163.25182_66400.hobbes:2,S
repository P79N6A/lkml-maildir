Hello,
I don't know if this is kernel-related.
I'me trying to mount my redhat iso's off an NTFS mount but I get a 
strange error.  Here is the exact command I am entering:
"mount -o loop -r -t iso9660 /mnt/win_d/Source/Iso/Red\ Hat\ 
7.3/valhalla-i386-disc1.iso /mnt/rh7.3/cd1"
It gives me an error
"ioctl: LOOP_SET_FD: Invalid argument"
A quick grep found that "Invalid argument" comes from:
'acsi.c:322:     { 0x24, "Invalid argument" }'
This might sound silly but I can't really seem to track it down.
Yes loop devices are enabled in my kernel.
It might interest you that I am running an SMP system (with the AMD 
controller).  But I don't think that should affect anything at such a 
higher level... You never know.
Anyone have any ideas?
Thanks!
