Storage Performance Monitor has been released.  This monitor allows to get read and write bps on a per disk, per controller, and systemwide basis.  This program is used in conjunction with a disk-io kernel patch.  This patch is available at www.swanson.uklinux.net for 2.4.17 and Mingming Cao's patch for 2.5.3-pre6 which was put on the lkml this week. Storage Performance Monitor can be downloaded from 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/cspm.
  This should be a great tool for kernel hackers and device driver developers to monitor io throughput.  This program will get the stats on all block devices with the the above patches.
Thanks
