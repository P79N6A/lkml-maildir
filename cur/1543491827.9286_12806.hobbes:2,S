Use the driver that NetGear sends with it's cards, assuming it's a new
card.  If you bought the card recently, NetGear includes a tulip.c on
it's driver disk in the 'Linux' directory.  cp that to
linux/drivers/net/tulip.c, replacing the one that comes with the kernel.
Select the DEC Tulip driver as usual, and recompile the kernel.
That's how mine works, anyhow.  Just be sure, with each new kernel,
copy the NG tulip.c, replacing the one that comes with the kernel.  As
far as I can tell, tulip.c hasn't been touched in quite a while, as
it's never in any of the patches. Personally, I think they should make
the NetGear tulip.c into it's own driver, instead of keeping it
bundled up with DEC.
