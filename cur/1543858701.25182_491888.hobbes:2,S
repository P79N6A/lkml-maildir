A very good question. Certainly, just hashing them would be a heck of a
lot simpler. That was my first inclination when I looked at this, but as
you said, HCH NAK'ed that idea stating that it would bloat out the
hashtable. I tend to think that it's probably not that significant, but
that might very much depend on workload.
I'm OK with either approach, though I'd like to have some sort of buyin
from Christoph on hashing the inodes before I start working on patches to
do that.
Christoph, care to comment?
