No supposed to. I remember having posted numbers that show a
difference.
Are you running a UP or SMP kernel ? If you run a UP kernel, the
cmpxchg_local and cmpxchg are identical.
Oh, and if you run your tests at boot time, the alternatives code may
have removed the lock prefix, therefore making cmpxchg and cmpxchg_local
exactly the same.
