Guess you (and I) need to read the code.
Now that we have per-CPU TSS segments,
8K per CPU would not be a big problem, but
you'll probably need to copy 8K bitmap
into TSS whenever dosemu task starts executing
on that CPU ('normal' tasks won't need large
io bitmap). That's slow but better that what you see now :)
Another question is where to keep it.
You probably need a pointer in task struct
and dynamically allocate bitmap for dosemu-like beasts...
