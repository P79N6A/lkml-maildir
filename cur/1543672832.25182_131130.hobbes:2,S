ALSA isn't working for me in 2.5.69.  It appears to be because
/proc/asound/dev is missing the control devices.
lsmod says I have:
Module                  Size  Used by
snd_cmipci             22168  -
snd_pcm                59968  -
snd_page_alloc          4140  -
snd_opl3_lib            5896  -
snd_timer              13888  -
snd_hwdep               4096  -
snd_mpu401_uart         3144  -
snd_rawmidi            12768  -
snd                    29156  -
soundcore               3296  -
and no errors were reported while loading those modules,
but "ls -l /proc/asound/dev" shows only:
total 0
crw-rw-rw-    1 root     root     116,  33 May  8 16:37 timer
and all the alsa utilities die trying to open other entries under
/dev/snd, which is a symlink to /proc/asound/dev (as set up by the
ALSA script.)
For instance, strace alsamixer shows this at the end:
access("/etc/asound.conf", R_OK)        = -1 ENOENT (No such file or
directory)
access("/root/.asoundrc", R_OK)         = -1 ENOENT (No such file or
directory)
open("/dev/snd/controlC0", O_RDONLY)    = -1 ENOENT (No such file or
directory)
open("/dev/aloadC0", O_RDONLY)          = -1 ENODEV (No such device)
open("/dev/snd/controlC0", O_RDWR)      = -1 ENOENT (No such file or
directory)
open("/dev/snd/controlC0", O_RDONLY)    = -1 ENOENT (No such file or
directory)
open("/dev/aloadC0", O_RDONLY)          = -1 ENODEV (No such device)
open("/dev/snd/controlC0", O_RDWR)      = -1 ENOENT (No such file or
directory)
fstat64(1, {st_mode=S_IFCHR|0620, st_rdev=makedev(136, 0), ...}) = 0
mmap2(NULL, 4096, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1,
0) = 0x40017000
write(1, "\n", 1
)                       = 1
write(2, "alsamixer: function snd_ctl_open"..., 79alsamixer: function
snd_ctl_open failed for default: No such file or directory
) = 79
munmap(0x40017000, 4096)                = 0
exit_group(1)                           = ?
Suggestions???
