Did you read README in the top-level directory of your kernel src?
It is wise to run
$ cp .config ../saved-config
$ make mrproper   <= this one deletes all .o files etc.
$ cp ../saved-config .config
$ make oldconfig dep bzImage modules
after patching the kernel
Did not build a 2.4.* kernel for a while, but the README should provide
all the details.
