We shouldn't, but we may want to add a CRC and copy routine.

Yes, and along with it the last use of the BSD TAILQ macros.  Just 
before Rob set up the open repos I finished converting most of those to 
list_head, the only one left is in the sa_event mechanism.  Rather than 
convert it I'd like to replace the use of sa_event with notifier call 
chains.  I just need to finish auditing the use to make sure the 
differences won't cause unexpected problems.
After than and unwrapping kernel functions, I think the only thing left 
before completly removing libsa is to open code the state machines.
Similarly I think net_types.h need to go.
