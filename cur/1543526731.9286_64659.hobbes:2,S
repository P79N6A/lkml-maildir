Did you notice that we currently have 3 `generic' implementations of
doubly-linked lists?  <linux/list.h> <linux/lists.h> and <linux/dlists.h>.
dlists.h is _completely_ unused.  lists.h is used by h8, as you noticed,
and sysctl.  list.h is used in a variety of places.  I'm kind of tempted
to put together a patch removing lists.h, but dlists.h should be deleted
before anyone uses it accidentally.
