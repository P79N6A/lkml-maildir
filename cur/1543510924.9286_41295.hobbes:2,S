Subject: ext2 for Solaris?

A while back I seem to recall someone saying that there was now
an ext2 filesystem available for Solaris/Sparc, but I can't find
any pointers to it. Does anyone have any more info? Ted's ext2
site only mentions the Win95 ext2 support, freshmeat also brings
up a reference to the OS/2 support, and none of the major search
engines turn anything up...
I'd like to be able to mount my Sparc Linux partitions on the few
occasions I feel the need to reboot into Solaris.
Any ideas?
Tet
