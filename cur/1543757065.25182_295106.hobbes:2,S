The CVS gateway does not reach the rest of bkbits.net.  For instance
the ipw2200 tree since they miss some of the files in their tarball
distribution.

Funnily enough the NWL probably isn't open-source because of the first
clause.  But frankly, it's irrelevant.

I read your mail as "you'll get that if and only the usual band stops
whining", which obviously won't happen.  Maybe I was wrong, I only
know that at that point I can't get useful files from free projects
hosted on bkbits if they're not the kernel itself.  Your extension
would indeed help.
