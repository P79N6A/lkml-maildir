Well, I've been doing suspend-resume with xfs for a while without
problems; the problems seem to be recent and easily repeatable.  Which
just means that it could be a new suspend-resume problem, of course.

OK, but I tend to find that xfs_freeze ends up locking up large parts of
the system...  (For example, I tried to do the xfs_freeze + lvm snapshot
thing, but the lvm snapshot just blocked on the frozen filesystem until
I unfroze it).  But I'll try it out.  Hm, is there some script I can
stick it into?
