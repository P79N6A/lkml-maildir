The usual way of using it is to use an ethernet switch and then put
all your AoE storage on that LAN.
You could probably get creative with tunnelling or something, but it's
easier to just configure a LAN.  If you really need storage over the
internet, you'd probably use something else like iSCSI.

We looked at the NBD stuff, but it's a different model, and it goes
over TCP/IP, if I recall correctly.  ATA over Ethernet is a simpler,
lower-level protocol, saving the host the work of doing TCP/IP.
