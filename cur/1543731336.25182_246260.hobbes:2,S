You, just like the rest of the world and even distribution makers if
they choose to do so, can patch the driver back into the kernel.
Just because it's not in the vanilla sources doesn't mean you can't
get a working setup.  Look at all the NVIDIA users out there. :-)
Are they moaning about how the vanilla kernel maintainers are making
them "throw away blah blah dollars of video cards"?  Absolutely not,
they load the binary-only blob, the go play quake3, and they're happy.

Not impossible, you're being rediculious, you can add the driver back
into the kernel you use just fine.  See above.
