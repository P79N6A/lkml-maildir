Hi.
My RAM died, and it corrupted my file system. It seems like this
machine just wants to die... [1]
After removing the faulty RAM, I can boot. I made extensive memtest86+ tests.
I now have my home partition mounted as read-only because of said corruption.
I see a bunch of "ext3_readdir: directory xxxx contains a hole at
offset xxxxx"  when I try to access some parts of my disk.
I postponed fscking the FS until I have identified the faulty data.
I was thinking of doing a rsync --dry-run against a known working
backup and check the logs. Any better idea? Is there a way to convert
the directory IDs into file paths?
I have around 500 000 files on that partition. It takes time checking them all.
Cheers,
Jerome
