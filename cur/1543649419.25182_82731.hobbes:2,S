No, because if you looked at the code for the online resize (even if it
is enabled, which is separately selectable), you would see it is
equivalent to the following in ext3_ioctl() and ext3_setup_super():
	if (doing online resize)
		do something;
	else
		don't even see any difference;
The resize code does not impact any code paths in the normal operation
of the filesystem, and 99% could even be put into a separate module,
that's how detached it is from the main ext3 code.
Cheers, Andreas
