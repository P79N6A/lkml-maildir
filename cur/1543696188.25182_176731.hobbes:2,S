While your tree is about a mac can get I had several troubles in the past
on other architectures and unfortunately I have to run them as well. Since
bandwidth is not as cheap as one might think I do *not* have the ressources
to keep several trees up-to-date. 
However I'm diffing your tree against a recent Linus version right now and will
retry.
