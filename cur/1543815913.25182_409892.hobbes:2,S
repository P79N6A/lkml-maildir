From cpufreq perspective multiple things are possible in the way
processor will support the multi-core frequency changing. and most of
the things are handled at cpufreq inside kernel. I think there should be
minima changes required in cpufreqd if any.
Options:
1) Multiple core can manage frequency independently: In this case,
cpufreq exports separate interfaces for each cpu in
/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpuX. So, cpufreqd should work as it would work
on an SMP system (Assuming that cpufreqd works fine on an SMP system
today ;-))
2) Multiple cores can be at a single frequency, but hardware will
coordinate between two cores internally (pick the highest frequency
request from two cores and run both of them at that frequency). This
will be very much similar to 1, in the way in which cpufreq and kernel
handles it.
3) Multiple cores can be at a single frequency and hardware depends on
OS to do the coordination, pick the maximum of all the requests from the
cores and set the frequency using appropriate hardware interface. This
is the case, where cpufreqd may need a change. In this case, say CPU 0
and 1 are two different cores on same package and they share frequency
and OS has to coordinate the freq request from these two CPUs. In this
case, /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/cpufreq will be kind of a symbolic
link to /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq. Cpufreq tells that these
two are dependent by using "affected_cpus" in the same sysfs directory
(in this case "0 1"). Now, if cpufreqd does a set_speed on cpu0 and
cpu1, both CPUs will be affected. Cpufreqd should be aware that these
CPUs are dependent and change freq based on maximum utilization of these
two CPUs.
