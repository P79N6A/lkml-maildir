Ok. Using a barrier() could be an overkill. I will change it.

Yes, indeed. With the current implementation, there's a possibility of
two instances of update_this_cpu() function executing - one with an
rcu_read_lock() taken (when called from load_debug_registers) while the
other without (when invoked through update_all_cpus()).
I will change update_this_cpu() to read like this:
+static void update_this_cpu(void *unused)
+{
+       struct cpu_hw_breakpoint *chbi;
+       struct task_struct *tsk = current;
+
+       chbi = &per_cpu(cpu_info, get_cpu());
+
+       rcu_read_lock();
+       /* Install both the kernel and the user breakpoints */
+       arch_install_chbi(chbi);
+       if (test_tsk_thread_flag(tsk, TIF_DEBUG))
+               switch_to_thread_hw_breakpoint(tsk);
+
+       rcu_read_unlock();
+
+       put_cpu_no_resched();
+}
while removing the rcu_read_(un)lock() routine from
load_debug_registers().
