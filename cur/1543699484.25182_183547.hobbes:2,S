Indeed...  I may have the only un-repaired Biostar M7VIB in the area 
out of several dozen.  All the rest have had those 4 caps right above 
the AGP slot replaced already.  And this one may also be the only one 
that doesn't get shut off at night.  However it is also very unstable 
when starting from cold, needing 3-5 resets to even get through post 
without trashing the video after I had it apart to clean the cpu 
fan/sink and psu the other night.  Its stable once thats been done, 
so I'm as usual, procrastinating.  Been doing it for 69 years now. :)
Hardware indeed.  I'm a Certified Electronics Technician.  Have 
someone check all those electrolyric caps in the on-board psu in 
particular, using a device similar to a "Capacitor Wizard" which 
measures not the capacity of the cap, but the caps Equivalent Series 
Resistance (ESR) at 100 kilohertz or more.  Anything over half an ohm 
should be replaced forthwith.  This assumes of course that your tech 
in charge of hot solder has the tools to do it correctly.  If not, 
find one who does have the tools.
Many mobos in a period ranging from about 2.5 to 1.5 years ago were 
built with caps that go defective prematurely due to a bad batch of 
them from several far eastern cap makers who were fed a bad recipe 
for the electrolyte in the caps, eg the Ethylene Glycol wasn't near 
pure enough.
