Hi all,
I use slack8 w/ 2.2.19 any of you use that to? 
Anyway, i was just wondering....
1. The good security updates [the ones you used]
2. Do i have to recompile kernel w/ iptables, [isn't  
    already set ]
3. I'm a kernel newbies as you can tell.  Whats a good
    site to read to point me in the right direction.  
     [from scratch]
thanx all
