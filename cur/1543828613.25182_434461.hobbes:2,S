Readers, I guess.  When there's a spinning writer, nothing prevents _new_
readers from getting into the read-locked region.  If we have enough
readers and the read-locked region is long enough, there's always at least
one reader in the read-locked region and the writer is permanently starved.

It beats crashing.
