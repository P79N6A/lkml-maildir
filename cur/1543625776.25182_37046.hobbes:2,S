I'm guessing the reason is that this module was initially developed on 
2.0 and ported to 2.2. and 2.4.  I think the kiobuf stuff is only in 
2.4+, right?  I should probably work on converting things, although our 
production Cplant cluster is still using 2.2.  It might help reduce our 
latency, although I'm guessing the page table walk is pretty quick.
This module needs to work on Alpha, i386, and ia64 so I'd have to look 
into the cache issues.
Thanks,
Kevin
