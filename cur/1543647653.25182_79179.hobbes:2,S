Guys - I use the excellent Mindi/Mondo backup & rescue tools on my RH7.3
box, which have worked perfectly throughout a whole range of recent
kernels, up to and including 2.4.19. But, since I started running
2.4.20-pre5 (and now -pre9), Mindi refused to work any more.
I consulted the developer, and we tracked the problem down to this
pathetically innocent command sequence in the script:
    fdisk -l | grep -w "/dev/hda6"
For some reason, this now produces, entirely at _random_, either one or
two lines of output! It was the duplicated output that broke Mindi. It's
easily accommodated in the script, but this randomness was never
exhibited on any earlier kernels. Is it me, or is this weird?
I hope this is useful in some way - anyone got any ideas?
Cheers
Alastair
