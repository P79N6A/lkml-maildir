Andrew,
USB hot plugging/modprobing gets in D state under 2.6.8-rc1-mm1, just
like noted in this thread
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=108936908420544&w=2
from 2.6.7-mm7
Linus's 2.6.8-rc1 works OK on my nForce2 based system.
Plugging keybd/mouse in PS2 slots fixes the USB stuck issue.
Kernel compiled with GCC 3.3.4 on Slackware 10.0.
Thanks,
Paul B.
