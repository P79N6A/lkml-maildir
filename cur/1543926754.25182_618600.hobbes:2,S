Subject: [PATCH] drivers/ide/ide-probe.c Skip ide_wait_not_busy on noprobe-disks.  was: [PATCH][RESUBMIT] drivers/ide/ide-probe.c, kernel 2.6.23.1
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

There is a problem in some hardware where the kernel will stall for
35 seconds waiting for disks that dont exist. This patch will skip
waiting for the BSY-bit on ide-drives to go away if you set
hdx=noprobe as a kernel option and the disk is not marked
as 'present' (like when you set the geometry by hand).
If no noprobe-option is set the code will work (more or less) as the 
original but if set the code will skip the ide_wait_not_busy() for that 
drive. Even if there would be a drive there and it is still BSY 
afterwards it should not matter since it isn't probed for later.
(The code also honors the MAX_DRIVES variable instead of assuming that 
there will be two harddrives on the bus.)
