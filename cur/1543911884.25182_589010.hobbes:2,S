Right. When setting up the clients, I remembered these "bind" mount 
things, and applied the same client-side because at this time I had 
other bugs for which I thought "bind" mount was the solution. In fact 
it's not, but as nfs4 is seen as a unique filesystem and I had several 
exported volumes, It was easier to mount the nfsv4 pseudoroot, then 
"bind" mount all the volumes from it.
But the bug's still here, and since these additional mounts appear 
"magically" in /proc/mounts, I don't know where to look at in the kernel 
source. The nfsv4 client code must have somewhere a kind of nfs4 
automounter for "nohide" volumes. A bit ugly IMHO, but the only way to 
show quotas for separates nfsv4 exported volumes too.
