Hello
Some days ago, I read about the idea of a completely modular kernel.
I think it's a very good idea, because it would make it easier to get more
people work at the same moment, development would go faster. It would
be possible to make groups for a certain part of the kernel (for example
sound, or filesystems, or main) with own group pages with status info and
todo's and own mailinglists (it would divide this enourmous flow of mail
into smaller parts). It would decrease the download size. I believe it would
make bug tracking easier as well. I'm sure I forgot to mention something..
Regards,
Taco Witte
