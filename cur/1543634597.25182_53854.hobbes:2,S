Hi,
a few month ago I already wrote about this, but at this time the machine was 
instable due to defect ECC-RAM, so I didn't create a symoops report.
Now the RAM is exchanged, the machine is much more stable, but not stable 
enough, it keeps oopsing and sometimes it also crashes at all (no reaction to 
keyboard (though Magic Sysrq's are enabled) and network).
Well the logfile is full of messages like this:
Jun 19 15:50:45 noether kernel: mtrr: Serverworks LE sdetected. 
Write-combining disabled.
Jun 19 15:50:45 noether kernel: mtrr: your processor doesn't support 
write-combining
Jun 19 15:50:45 noether kernel: mtrr: Serverworks LE detected. Write-combining 
disabled.
Jun 19 15:50:45 noether kernel: mtrr: your processor doesn't support 
write-combining
Unfortunality, the bios has no option to disable Write-combining (as someone 
suggested).
For the last oops I've created a ksymoops report. Well, its my first one and I 
hope I havn't made any mistakes (actually I havn't read the ksymoops manpage 
in detail). The ksymoops output is attached as bzip2-file.
Thanks in advance for any help,
Bernd
PS: Some system specific details are also attached. If you need more 
information, please don't hesitate to ask.
