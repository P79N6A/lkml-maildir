It would be nice to see some of these things end up in a generic
place. Now that we can wrap our spinlocks easily (preempt changed
all the spinlocks to _raw_*) we could create a generic debug option
that checked:
uninitialised lock, timeout on deadlock, double lock by same cpu,
unlock by another cpu, unlock when not locked, scheduling with lock held,
read lock when same cpu has write lock.
And Im sure there are some more useful tests.
