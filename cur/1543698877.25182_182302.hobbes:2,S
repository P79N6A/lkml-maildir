And so does windows. That doesn't make it good.

I tried to tell him why numbers are bad. Very politely, explaining that a
lot of devices cannot be enumerated by a traditional "bus/dev/lun" scheme.
He basically cursed at me, and told me that that is how SCSI works. Never
mind that IDE isn't SCSI, and even SCSI doesn't work that way any more
(iSCSI comes to mind).
I can be polite. But when there is no reason to be polite, I can be blunt
too.
