They are the theoretical worst case. Obviously with a non trivially
sized system and non-DoS workload, they will not be reached.

It is not simply a question of once-off chance for an all-at-once layout
to fail in this way. Fragmentation slowly builds over time, and especially
if you do actually use higher-order pages for a significant number of
things (unlike we do today), then the problem will become worse. If you
have any part of your workload that is affected by fragmentation, then
it will cause unfragmented regions to eventually be used for fragmentation
inducing allocations (by definition -- if it did not, eg. then there would be
no fragmentation problem and no need for Mel's patches).
I don't know what happens as time tends towards infinity, but I don't think
it will be good.
At millions of allocations per second, how long does it take to produce
an unacceptable number of free pages before the ENOMEM condition?
Furthermore, what *is* an unacceptable number? I don't know. I am not
trying to push this feature in, so the burden is not mine to make sure it
is OK.
Yes, we already have some of these problems today. Introducing more
and worse problems and justifying them because of existing ones is much
more silly than my quoting of the numbers. IMO.
