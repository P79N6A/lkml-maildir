The question is against Ben's comments. Pls. don't delete his comments

I wanted to clarify that we need differentiate link/hard reset from
callback link_reset and slot_reset when discussing the API.

I need repeat my idea.
1) My new pci_error_handlers doesn't always choose to reset slot. It
still depends on the return value of error_detected.
2) As a matter of fact, most cases of specific device's error_detected callback
will choose to return PCI_ERS_RESULT_NEED_RESET. Like what you did for
e100/e1000/ipr.

If it's not the best way, why did you choose to reset slot for e1000/e100/ipr
error handlers? They are typical widely-used devices. To make it easier to
add error handlers?
