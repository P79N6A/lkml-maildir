That would be kida ugly because I'd need a dummy module then for the
cards which need neither saa7134-empress nor saa7134-dvb (which is true
for most of the existing cards btw).
I can fix that in the driver, by delaying the request_module() somehow
until the saa7134 module initialization is finished.  I don't think that
this is a good idea through as it looks like I'm not the only one with
that problem ...
