Fixed in 2.1.131ac8 or thereabouts. There might be some loose ends left,
haven't tripped over them with egcs snapshots on i586. If you see any
problems, please report them in detail here.
2.0.xx will _not_ be modified for egcs (too great risk of instability for
little gain), use gcc-2.7.2.3 with it.
