Roland, I don't think (pretty sure actually ;) we can handle the case 
where TF is set from userspace and, at the same time, the user uses 
PTRACE_SINGLESTEP. The ptrace infrastructure uses the hw TF flag to work. 
The PTRACE_SINGLESTEP gives you the SYSGOOD behaviour, if you set it. And 
sends a SIGTRAP notification to the ptrace'ing parent process.
