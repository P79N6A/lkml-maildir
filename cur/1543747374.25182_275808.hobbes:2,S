[PATCH] I2C: More verbose w83l785ts driver
This simple patch increases the verbosity of the w83l785ts hardware
monitoring driver. I wrote it months ago in the hope it would help solve
a reported problem [1]. Not sure whether it did (no news from user since
July), but the extra debug info may help in the future and doesn't hurt
otherwise, so let's have this in for every user (not that many AFAIK),
just in case.
