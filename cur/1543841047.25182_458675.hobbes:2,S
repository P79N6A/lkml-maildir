One patch was provided which failed. Another patch was provided that to
get more output, the new log is in
http://neualius.turmzimmer.net/~aba/6G/kernel-20060807.log
If there is anything more I should provide, please don't hesitate to
ping me. Unfortunatly, I'm not subscribed to lkml right now.
Cheers,
Andi
