There is a distinction between suid-root and suid-others. You can
still have your suid-lp binaries and also overload the meaning of
suid-root.
The headers would have a mask of capabilities to grant, which the
kernel reads if the binary is suid-root, and also a mask of
capabilities to deny, which is always read.
You can then have a suid-root binary with:
grant: CAP_EUID_ROOT
deny:  ~CAP_EUID_ROOT
which gives you suid-root with no capabilities.
