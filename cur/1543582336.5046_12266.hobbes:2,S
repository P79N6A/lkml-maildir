Steve,
You are correct in the expanded definition and stand corrected; however, I
assumed that we were already beyond the personal use issue.  Because we
were describing the situation of commerial issues.  If this is all about
personal use of the source and not redistribition for commerial purpose
then why has it even used this much time of mailing list?
