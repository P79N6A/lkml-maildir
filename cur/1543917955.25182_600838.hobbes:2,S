The basic incompatibility with what that provides and what I need is
that percpu_counters allow some fuzziness in the numbers.  One cpu can
be summing the numbers up while another is still adding to the local
percpu counters.  That's fine for statistics, but horrible for questions
like, "can anybody write to and corrupt my FS right now?"
It could probably be modified to do what I want, but it would still have
a the "invented your own lock" problem, and would likely impact the
scalability of the existing "fuzzy" users.
We could introduce fuzzy and coherent variants of the function calls,
but that would probably introduce more code than what I have now for the
very specific mnt_writer_lock.

I think that can get converted to use the percpu_counters pretty easily.
I've coded that up, and sent it [RFC] to lkml.  Rusty will forward on
into mainline.
