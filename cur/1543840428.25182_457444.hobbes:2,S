In theory anything that is undefined in the C standard should be avoided
because gcc is free to make assumptions about it and generate unexpected 
code.
In practice Linux does a lot of not-quite-legal-in-portable-C things
already, but tries to avoid areas that are known to have miscompiled in
the past.
Best is to avoid undefined behaviour in new code.
