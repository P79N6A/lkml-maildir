Yes, you're right. The Athlon recommendation is pretty complicated
(they have different versions for different registers to avoid lengthening
dependency chains), but it uses different two byte nops. 
They explicitely say that it works well on "other CPUs" too which
likely means Intel.
Basically it is: 
         NOP2_EAX TEXTEQU <DB 08Bh,0C0h> ;MOV EAX, EAX
         NOP3_EAX TEXTEQU <DB 08Dh,004h,020h> ;LEA EAX, [EAX]
         NOP4_EAX TEXTEQU <DB 08Dh,044h,020h,000h> ;LEA EAX, [EAX+00]
        ;LEA EAX, [EAX+00];NOP
         NOP5_EAX TEXTEQU <DB 08Dh,044h,020h,000h,090h> 
        ;LEA EAX, [EAX+00000000]
         NOP6_EAX TEXTEQU <DB 08Dh,080h,0,0,0,0>
        ;LEA EAX, [EAX*1+00000000]
         NOP7_EAX TEXTEQU <DB 08Dh,004h,005h,0,0,0,0>
        ;LEA EAX, [EAX*1+00000000] ;NOP
         NOP8_EAX TEXTEQU <DB 08Dh,004h,005h,0,0,0,0,90h>
        ;JMP
         NOP9 TEXTEQU <DB 0EBh,007h,90h,90h,90h,90h,90h,90h,90h>
(+ the same for all other GPRs). Someone must have too much time
when documenting this ;)
But I'm not gonna resubmit with that unless if you insist on it...
