39160 does 80MB/s/channel, the 160MB/s happens pretty much only as
the sum of both channels. I've had one for a couple of years, and it
performs very well, though it won't ever quite live up to the marketing
gimmick for bandwidth on a single channel. ISTR something about RAID
across channels involved, but I just use disks directly instead.
