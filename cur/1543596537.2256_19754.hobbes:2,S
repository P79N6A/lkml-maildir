hmmm, it looks almost ok to me.
The tasklet is locked before the "repeat" label, so any tasklet
scheduling itself will set the bit, but NOT actually schedule iteself. 
For this see the tasket_schedule code, for the case where the bit is not
set, but the tasklet is locked.
The first statement above schedules the tasklet if the bit was set while
the tasklet was locked.  The second statement, as the comment right
above it indicates, causes the tasklet to repeat itself.
The only thing that appears fishy is that if the tasklet constantly
reschedules itself, it will never leave the loop AFAICS.  This affects
tasklet_hi_action as well as tasklet_action.
