I disagree. This is unrelated to kernel development, just like working
on sparse is unrelated to kernel development.

Possibly. So we need discussion.
I have registered comment #1: Al prefers the enum style.
A possibility.
Now you come with comment #2: write LINUX_MS_RDONLY instead of
MS_RDONLY. You have not convinced me.

Today glibc tells me in sys/mount.h
 #define MS_RMT_MASK (MS_RDONLY | MS_MANDLOCK)
and in linux/fs.h
 #define MS_RMT_MASK (MS_RDONLY|MS_NOSUID|MS_NODEV|MS_NOEXEC|MS_SYNCHRONOUS|MS_MANDLOCK|MS_NOATIME|MS_NODIRATIME)
It seems glibc is not even self-consistent.
Consider linuxabi/mountflags.h as part of the replacement for linux/fs.h.
