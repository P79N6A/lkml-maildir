I suggest to implement scalable solution, so the final user wont't have 
to write separate wrapper for *each* program. universal wrapper is 
better solution, but (now i know, that implementing something that can 
be dangerous if used incorrectly is so evil, that only the devil could 
have proposed it) it forces use of database (that normally would be kept 
in filesystem's file metadata) and if some-malicious-person would have 
accessed it in write mode (as result of wrong file permissions), the 
system performerance would be in danger. in my solution, there is 
per-file attribute, accessible only for root, and if hacker has root 
permissions, existence of nice attribute is meaningless.
