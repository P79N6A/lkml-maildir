Right, it just seemed odd to me when I was eyeballing this code.

Why smp_found_config isn't set in that guys configuration is a mystery to me,
as his MPS tables look sane..
MP Table:
#	APIC ID	Version	State		Family	Model	Step	Flags
#	 0	 0x10	 BSP, usable	 6	 2	 1	 0x0381
#	 0	 0x10	 AP, usable	 6	 1	 7	 0xfbff
Hmm, wait, he has unpaired CPUs. I wonder if that's the reason.
I know *some* combinations of PPro's are valid to be paired, but I'll
need to dig out the old docs to be sure.
