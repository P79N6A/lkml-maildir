I can't reproduce your problem with your .config .
Did you do something like patching the kernel or changing the SMP option
without running "make oldconfig" afterwards?
What are the values of __ver_atomic_dec_and_lock at the two places
mentiones in the warnings?
Does a
  cp .config /tmp
  make mrproper
  mv /tmp/.config
  make oldconfig
  make bzImage
fix this problem?
