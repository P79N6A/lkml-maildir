Yes here was some test made some time ago (not so far):

more same method here:
# dd if=/dev/hdd bs=2048 count=1569 | md5sum
dd: reading `/dev/hdd': Input/output error
1528+0 records in
1528+0 records out
3129344 bytes (3.1 MB) copied, 10.1961 seconds, 307 kB/s
0337e9846d17779945c5c252d4f897f0  -
is the same wrong results.

mmm I always used successfully dd method at my office with scsi cdrom drive (even for bootable disk).

It came from an age (see >> brw-rw---- 1 root disk 8, 32 Dec  1  2001 /dev/sdc)
when 15Gb disk was enough to test severall Linux distro ;-)
At the same time I was also working with a distro runing on a x486 100Mhz, a few ram and 128Mb of disk ;-)
