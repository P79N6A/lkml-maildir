Does netlink solve the fact that there are cards (at least in 2.4)
that do not support any detection method:
ne2k-pci

    SIOCGMIIPHY failed (Operation not permitted)
    SIOCDEVPRIVATE failed (Operation not supported)
3c59x (3c980-TX)
    SIOCETHTOOL failed (Operation not permitted)
    SIOCGMIIPHY failed (Operation not permitted)
    SIOCDEVPRIVATE: unplugged
3c59x (3c905C-TX/TX-M)
    SIOCETHTOOL failed (Operation not supported)
    SIOCGMIIPHY: link beat detected
    SIOCDEVPRIVATE: link beat detected
