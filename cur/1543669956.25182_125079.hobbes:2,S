 The graphs in the "skippy" disk benchmark paper are
interesting -- some disks show bizarre peaks and dips in their
times across increasing sector distances. (The lesson here might
be to test your disks and avoid the bad actors rather than try
to compensate for their behavior, though.)

 The RAID1 code has its own scheduler that does similar things.  Why
aren't they being integrated? (See raid1.c:read_balance())
