We're working on it - honest!
The book will go out for technical review before too long; I believe the
current target date to have it on the shelves is April.  We'd hoped for
sooner, but, given how 2.4 development has gone, I think the timing is
about right.  After all, we wouldn't want to present the wrong prototype
for kmap() or miss out on the new inter-module communication API...:)
