Of course.  My only point is the old nugget that the only
useful benchmark is your own actual workload.

Will try this.

Not sure how to determine this.  Postgresql is using 512MB
shared memory total.  This is configured in postgresql.conf.
I'm not certain how mysql uses shared memory.  I do know
that it doesn't bother mmaping its data files.

I can give you this in a few days.  I'm not at liberty to reboot the
machine.

I actually think swap activity is minimal, despite the large amount
of swap used.  The disk with the swap (and root) filesystem has only
360242 commands since boot time, compared with 15 million commands
on the data disks.

I don't know if this will be possible.
