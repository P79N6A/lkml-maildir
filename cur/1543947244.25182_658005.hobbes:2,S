stupid double check, does "git-log | grep stackpro" give you the fixes:
    This patch adds a simple self-test capability to the stackprotector
    x86: unify stackprotector features
    streamline the stackprotector features under a single option
    x86: stackprotector: mix TSC to the boot canary
    x86: fix the stackprotector canary of the boot CPU
    stackprotector: add boot_init_stack_canary()
    stackprotector: include files
?
Please send me your full .config and the gcc version you used for 
building the failing kernel.
