Hi all,
I have to develop some real-time code. I need to execute some code *any* time 
the executing task changes.
I already tried to put a hook in the __schedule() function, before the call to 
the context_switch() function. 
However, my code is called two consecutive times with the same prev or the 
same next: seems that between two consecutive calls someone has changed the 
executing task...
Can somebody please tell me where exactly I should put my hook ??
Many thanks,
           Claudio Scordino
