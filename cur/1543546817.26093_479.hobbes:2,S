Why?  I don't think POSIX specifies this. Did I miss something?
Please also note that pthread_kill must work within the thread group
although POSIX does not require thread references to work outside
the thread group.
Also consider a non-pthreads program that does a clone. Should ps show
the two processes as a single process?
