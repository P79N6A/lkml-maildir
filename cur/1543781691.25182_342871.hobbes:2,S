What about a zero-copy read-interface?
An ioctl (or something) which enables the kernel to do dma directly to
the userspace. Of course this should be limited to the root-user or a
user with special capabilities (rights) since if a drive screws up, data
from a different sector (or so) might end up in the proces' memory. Of
course copying a sector from kernel- to userspace can be done pretty
fast but i.m.h.o. all possible speedimprovements should be made unless
unclean.
