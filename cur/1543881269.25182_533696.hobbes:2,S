I can work on that as a side note, but while the GART IOMMU is still in the 
kernel then we need this fix.

Mark pointed this out and he can answer best.  I believe he was referring to 
section 5.3.4 point 8:
"Core-logic accesses to the GART are not guaranteed to be coherent with host 
processor caches. In
order to avoid having to flush the cache after every GART update, portable 
system software should
place the GART in a range of the physical memory space that is considered 
un-cacheable by host
processors. (A good example is mapping the GART as UC in an IntelÒ PentiumÒ II 
processor).
However, the specification does not preclude the placement of the GART in 
cachable memory
space in cases where the coherency is guaranteed through some hardware or 
software
mechanism."
updated patch follows with corrected long lone.

This patches fixes the silent data corruption problems being seen using the 
GART iommu where 4kB of data where incorrect (seen mostly on Nvidia CK804 
systems).  This fix to mark the memory regin the GART PTEs reside on as 
uncacheable also brings the code in line with the AGP specification.
