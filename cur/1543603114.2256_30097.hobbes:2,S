Naturally.  However, this is orthogonal.  Consider the case where you've hit 
the wall and the inactive list has suffered sudden depletion.  At this point 
you have to deactivate a large number of pages and you will have few or no 
intervening age-up events (because you hit the wall and nobody's moving).  
It's a useless waste of CPU and real time to cycle through the active list 5 
times to deactivate enough pages.  You should cycle through at most twice, 
once to age up any pages with Ref set and the second time to deactivate the 
required number of pages according to a threshold you estimated on the first 
pass.
This is just the first common example that came to mind where a variable 
deactivation threshold is obviously desirable, I'm sure there are others.

No question about the need for higher level process control, but the low 
level machinery could still be improved, don't you think?
