i've uploaded the -T8 VP patch:
  
http://redhat.com/~mingo/voluntary-preempt/voluntary-preempt-2.6.9-rc4-mm1-T8
lots of stabilization of CONFIG_PREEMPT_REALTIME. It's still in
experimental status but general stability is improving.
Changes since -T7:
 - fixed a nasty category of bugs that were introduced by the use of 
   rwsems for rwlocks. rwsems are not read-recursive, while rwlocks are. 
   Fortunately it was not too hard to identify & fix recursive users of
   tasklist_lock, in fact each of these also qualifies as a cleanup. The 
   symptom of this bug was a soft-deadlocking of the system. 
 - fixed profiler locks, i believe this could resolve the bootup crash
   reported by K.R. Foley.
 - fixed VP / XFS namespace collision reported by Mark H. Johnson
 - fix one more final detail of the new zombie-task handling code
 - fixed 3c59x.c, fasync-handling, ipv6, module-loader runtime
   warnings reported by K.R. Foley.
 - fixed the ali5451 locking
to create a -T8 tree from scratch the patching order is:
