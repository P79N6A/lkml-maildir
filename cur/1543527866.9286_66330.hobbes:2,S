Petr,
I think pci_enable_device is a good idea for all devices, since it does
other stuff than just twiddling PCI_COMMAND bits.  fbdev devices are of
course a special case though :)  I was thinking about something like the
following for s3fb...
s3fb_init_one()
	save state of PCI_COMMAND
	call pci_enable_device
	handle POST, possibly requiring VGA I/O ports
	disable I/O region decoding
