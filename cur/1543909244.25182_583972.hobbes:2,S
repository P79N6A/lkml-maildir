hard disc is a Western Digital 10k Raptor connected to the ICH9R. on
the second port of the southbridge is another Samsung hard disc drive
connected without errors. both controllers are running ahci mode.

i've tried changing the SATA cables and also the power wire to the
disc without success. i checked the disc successfully with Hitachi
drive fitness test. it has worked without any trouble so far in a Intel
P965 ICH8 based mainboard.
any idea how to find the reason?
