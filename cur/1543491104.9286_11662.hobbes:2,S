I've optimized a bit the interrupt handler and made a bunch of
tests. Now with kernel 2.0.36 UP on a PII 450 MHz, the driver never
loses any interrupt (4000 ints per second), even under very high load.
On the very same computer, when I boot it with 2.0.36 SMP, the driver
keeps losing interrupts, even with moderate and low load. The problem
seems to be happening when there is an IPI interrupt.
[I must read smp.tex to understand what is this IPI]
But the IPI interrupt seems to be happening along with many other
interrupts (IPI, scsi, eth, PCI RS422)... 
When a single device produces many interrupts individually (alone),
the problem doesn't occur. 
So the problem might be the overall time required to consume all the
interrupts.... Since our driver must acknowledge with 0.512 ms after
the interrupt.
Perhaps switching to 2.2.4acx would do the job since interrupts are
sent the both CPUs and not only CPU 0...

Thanks Alan,
   have nice weekend,
	Claude
P.S.: I "monitored" the interrupts with xosview + cat /proc/interrupts.
