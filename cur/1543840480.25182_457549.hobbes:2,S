hi, I am newbie to linux kernel development, but I couldn't get my
question answered on #kernelnewbies, and I am not able to get it right
from code.
I studied smc91x driver to understand how platform driver / device
subsystem works. On #kernelnewbies channel I was told this driver is
"hopelessly broken". How should one create and register the
platform_device/driver ? Is the implementation in smc91x correct ?
If someone could clarify this, I will appreciate that, and certainly
write some newbie-understandable documentation. It is not covered by
LDD AFAIK.
thanks, have a nice day
please CC me, I am not on the list
