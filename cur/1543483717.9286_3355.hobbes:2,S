    Well, we need to support multiple charsets -- at least different
    versions of ISO 8859, as well as KOI-8 and the like -- as soon as
    possible.  2022 seems to be the standard of choice, and I think the VT
    terminal can easily be adapted to be 2022 compliant.
Yes, it is not too far from it. But:
- Code Page nnnn is not ISO 2022 compliant.
  Alt and KOI-8 are not ISO 2022 either.
  And Unicode does not follow ISO 2022 either.
  We'll need something more general than ISO 2022 in any case.
- What do you mean: support multiple charsets?
  More than one simultaneously? With escape codes switching?
  And this built into the kernel?
  Why not in xterm or vtterm?
