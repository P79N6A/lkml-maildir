"out of pci_dev" and into struct device?
I think that's all parisc port would need now.
At some point I'd like to propose "dma_hint" field.
But I don't have a specific proposal yet.
Something to help drivers communicate DMA characteristics to
the IOMMU support code. ie bandwidth needed, cacheline line aware,
MWLI support, etc.
