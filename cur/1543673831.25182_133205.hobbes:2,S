I forgot to count the BSP in the initial count of the number of kicked
cpus. This patch does it correctly.
To handle sparse physical APIC ID's properly the phys_cpu_present_map
must be scanned beyond bit NR_CPUS while ensuring no more than NR_CPUS
are woken in order not to attempt to wake non-addressible cpus.
The following patch adds that logic to smp_boot_cpus() and corrects the
failure to wake secondaries reported by dhowells, with successful
wakeup, runtime, reboot, and halting reported after it was applied.
