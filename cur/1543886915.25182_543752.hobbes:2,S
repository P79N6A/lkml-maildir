Likely.

Regardless not putting a jump in there violates the principle of
be conservative in what you send.

Even on 386 and 486 class cpus?
To some extent if the rules don't change it makes sense for them to
copy the information from one generation to the next of the architecture.
Even if the current cpus don't really care.
I guess I just don't see the sense in taking chances if we don't have
to, and I don't see any real advantage of doing a data segment reload
before the jump.
