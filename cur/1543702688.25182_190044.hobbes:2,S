Problem
=======
After upgrading from linux-2.4.21 to 2.6.0,
my camera Sony DSC-F505V doesn't connect anymore.
What I tried myself
===================
I had to change a module name: usb-uhci    (2.4.21) --> uhci-hcd    (2.6.0),
and a hyphen:                  usb-storage (2.4.21) --> usb_storage (2.6.0)
I noticed that the F505 entry in unusual_devs.h changed in 2.6.0.
I fooled around with this a bit without seeing an improvement.
What does work
==============
The usb-storage part seems to work. See /var/log/message:
kernel: scsi0 : SCSI emulation for USB Mass Storage devices
kernel:   Vendor: Sony      Model: Sony DSC          Rev: 2.10
kernel:   Type:   Direct-Access                      ANSI SCSI revision: 02
kernel: SCSI device sda: 126848 512-byte hdwr sectors (65 MB)
What is still missing
=====================
What is missing in 2.6.0 is the 2.4.21 log message:
   Attached scsi removable disk sda at scsi0, channel 0, id 0, lun 0
Accordingly, 'mount' will fail with 'not a valid block device'.
Any help is appreciated. Thanks in advance!
