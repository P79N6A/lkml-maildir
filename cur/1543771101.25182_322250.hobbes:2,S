Please don't do this. Just use "Reply to all"... If you start messing up 
Reply-To: you risk loosing the possibility of getting back to the person 
who send the mail.  I sometimes send emails to LKML from work, and 
naturally I put my home email addr. in Reply-To: so people who respond 
send their reply to a location where I'll actually see it.. Also when I'm 
travelling I may send mails from locations I'll never re-visit and use 
temporary addresses (or other peoples addresses), without being able to 
set Reply-To: properly, I'd never get the replies.
There are lots of other good reasons not to do this. I'd suggest you read
