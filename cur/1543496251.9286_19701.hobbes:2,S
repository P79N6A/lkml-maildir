It's not an alias, it's a request for a driver that handles block devices with
major number 8. Look into linux/Documentation/devices.txt and you will find
that block major 8 are SCSI disks. Now you'd have to find out what module
handles them, in this case it's sd.o . So in order to have them handled, you'd
need to add
  alias block-major-8 sd
to /etc/conf.modules, or, if you don't need it
  alias block-major-8 off
If you get this because you're trying to access a parallel zip drive, add
  alias block-major-8 ppa
and 
  pre-install ppa insmod -k sd
