make that -31-13 (or later). Earlier kernels had a bug in where the
process name tracking only worked for the first latency trace saved,
subsequent traces showed 'unknown' for the process name. In -13 i've
also added a printk that shows the latest user latency in a one-line
printk - just like the built-in latency tracing modes do:
 (gettimeofday/3671/CPU#0): new 3068 us user-latency.
 (gettimeofday/3784/CPU#0): new 1008627 us user-latency.
(this should also make it easier for helper scripts to save the traces,
whenever they happen.)
