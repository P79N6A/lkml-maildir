A PIII with 96MB ram became extremely sluggish inside X11. I managed
to terminate the X server, bringing the system in a useful state
again. While the system was completely quiet (no X server) I noticed
that a lot of both memory and swap was being used for no appearent reason:
# free 
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:         93692      85164       8528          0       1404      75252
-/+ buffers/cache:       8508      85184
Swap:       133048      54944      78104
# swapoff -a
	(took a minute)
# free
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:         93692      41760      51932          0       1420      24828
-/+ buffers/cache:      15512      78180
Swap:            0          0          0
# swapon -a
# free
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:         93692      41852      51840          0       1420      24848
-/+ buffers/cache:      15584      78108
Swap:       133048          0     133048
It looks as if the swap partition is being cached in main memory.
