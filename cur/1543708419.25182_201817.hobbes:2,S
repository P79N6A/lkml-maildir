I have them for 2.6.3-mm3, am re-running 2.6.3-mm1 right now.
Gross results are within 1%, but looking at the detail, i do see badness,
example:
Kernel    Users  Run time
2.6.3	  20     32.11
2.6.3-mm3 20     35.47
2.6.3	  40     63.64
2.6.3-mm2 40     66.33
Again, this shows up best on the bottom graph on the page.
Graphn of 2.6.3 vs 2.6.3-mm3 :
