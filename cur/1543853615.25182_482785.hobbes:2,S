That's what happens when two drivers want to drive the same hardware. 
The "slow and safe" default is the only proven-stable option, with the 
proven-stable PATA driver.  The other two options (drivers/ide for 
PATA+SATA -> leads to SATA locksup) and (libata for PATA -> ok but 
breaks existing configs, and less field time) are considered less safe.
Combined mode is ugly no matter how you look at it.  Just turn it off in 
BIOS (or pressure system vendor for this ability if BIOS lacks it, e.g. 
some Dell servers)
And throw some annoyance at Intel for creating such a headache.
