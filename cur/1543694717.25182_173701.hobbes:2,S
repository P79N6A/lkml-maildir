I think I have exactly the same HPT-bios version.
The mb's bios is anyway dated 2003-03-07 so I think
we have the same version. Unfortunately, I'm unable
to check the bios version of the 875P-base mb for now
(but I think it was the same 1.24 as well).
Are you capable of trying if the hdparm -m0 trick
works for you ?
