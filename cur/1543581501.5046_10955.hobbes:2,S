This could be that bus master DMA caching problem that showed up on my
KT133 A7V (see previous threads re: 'VIA silent disk corruption'). You
could try more conservative BIOS chipset settings (my problem went away
with "normal" rather than "optimal" BIOS settings). In the end Asus
released a BIOS update for the A7V that seems to have fixed it
permanently.
