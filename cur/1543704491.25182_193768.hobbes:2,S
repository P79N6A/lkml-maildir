Subject: 2.6.2-rc1-bk3 patch fails
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/1/25/98

Applying the above patch to 2.6.1 gets failure in:-
. Makefile
. arch/i386/kernel/cpu/mcheck/non-fatal.c
. drivers/cdrom/cdrom.c
. drivers/input/joydev.c
. drivers/input/keyboard/atkbd.c
. drivers/md/Kconfig
. drivers/md/raid6.h  (doesn't exist)
I control C'd out of the rest.  The BK snapshots on 
kernel.org aren't meant to be applied cumulatively, 
are they?
Mike
