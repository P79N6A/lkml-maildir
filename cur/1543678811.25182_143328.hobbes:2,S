That was kind of the point. If I have to check and copy the includes
all the time I may run into trouble because of such changes. Whereas
without that, I only have to recompile. I don't have to check each and
evry possible place where old headers may be, which may even be
different for every distribution.

I was never talking about binaries. Of course, binaries break and you
won't make such radical changes in your drivers. This was only an
example.
The problem with this entire thread was that Christoph was trying to
make a point, and I was only trying to make sure that I don't get
emails complaining about how my sources won't compile with the kernel
drivers (not that I would ever use those).
