Hello, I experience a fatal oops while rebooting/shutting down.
I *think* that the cause is the removal of one of the ham-radio
modules, either netrom or rose. The last message written on the screen
is "in swapper task. not syncing", and obviously nothing appears in
the logs so I can't run ksymoops on it.
Is there a way I can send the oops on eth0 to another machine? (I
don't have enough cable to run console on serial port using the other
machine)
Pf
