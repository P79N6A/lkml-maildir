This is a more general question based on the thread
"NONBLOCKing close blocks in named" which was referring
to sockets.
I presumed that the close() on a char driver like
the SCSI sg could not block. This opens up the problem
of what to do if the file descriptor in question still
has a SCSI command outstanding. This can be handled
by flagging but the wheels fall off if the driver
is a module and a "rmmod" is then performed. [Should a
"rmmod" be blocked in this situation?]
