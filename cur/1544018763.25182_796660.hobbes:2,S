Hm, I may have spoke too fast:
Added: (IDE ONLY), no SATA:
image=/boot/2.6.26-6
         label=2.6.26-6
         read-only
         root=current
p254:/boot# lilo
Added 2.6.26-6 *
Added 2.6.28-4
p254:/boot#
Set to current.
p254:/boot# grep =current /etc/lilo.conf
root=current
         root=current
p254:/boot#
The reason current may have worked before is because I manually booted with
root=/dev/sdd2 (after I saw the error that it could not find root,302, etc)
So I am booting the old kernel without the SATA drivers with root=current
to see if it works..
Nope, so I need to figure out how to get the UUID= option working in LILO.
Justin.
