Looks good.  :-)
What kernel are your patches against?
2.6.18-rc4 gives me:
<--  snip  -->
...
  CHK     include/linux/version.h
  CHK     include/linux/utsrelease.h
  CC      arch/i386/kernel/asm-offsets.s
  GEN     include/asm-i386/asm-offsets.h
  HOSTCC  scripts/kallsyms
  HOSTCC  scripts/conmakehash
  HOSTCC  scripts/bin2c
make[1]: *** No rule to make target `/home/bunk/linux/linux-2.6.18-rc4/dummy.c', needed by `init/init.o'.  Stop.

    Gentoo kernels are 42 times more popular than SUSE kernels among
    KLive users  (a service by SUSE contractor Andrea Arcangeli that
    gathers data about kernels from many users worldwide).
