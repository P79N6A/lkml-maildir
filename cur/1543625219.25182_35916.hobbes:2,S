Subject: [PATCH] Support for Belkin Wireless PCI Adapter (PLX PCI9502 Based) in Kernel >= 2.4.18
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I'm not sure who the current "keeper of the flame" is on drivers/net/wireless/orinoco_plx.c so I'm submitting this patch to any conceivably appropriate places.
This patch adds support to the Linux kernel (tested on 2.4.18, 2.4.19-pre3 and 2.4.19-pre3-ac1) for the Belkin F5D6000 "Wireless Desktop PCI Network Adapter".  This is a PLX PCI9502 based PCMCIA adapter that allows 802.11b wireless network cards (mainly Prism2 based, like the Belkin F5D6020) to work on desktop boxen. 
This patch would be a great addition to the appropriate packages, including the Linux kernel as Belkins components tend to be low cost and high quality, as well as widely available.
The patch contents are basically an addition to orinoco_plx.c so that it recognizes the IO Addresses of the Belkin F5D6000 and configures it appropriately.  It is a small patch but it does the trick; I have tested it extensively on my Linux box in both Managed and Ad-Hoc modes with a Belkin F5D6020 card.
It has been applied and tested (as aformentioned) against 2.4.18, 2.4.19-pre3 and 2.4.19-pre3-ac1.
I am posting a page at

 with more details on this patch and using Belkin's Wireless components with Linux for those interested.
Patch follows inline & attached:
