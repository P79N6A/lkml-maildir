I believe that immutable bit is NOT currently supported by tar. So
your solution does not work right away. Aha. Forgoet what I said. You
are right - you want kernel to  change _both_ bits at one request,
which will work. Nice.

Yes. And with my suid scheme, I could just compile it into kernel
unconditionally, and would not need to tell anyone. See the
difference?
