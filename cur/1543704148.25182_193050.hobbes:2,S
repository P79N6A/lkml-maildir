Subject: looking for recent lkml archives in mbox format

Hi folks,
If someone's willing to send me the lkml archives from Jan 13 to the 22,
please contact me privately. I had some email problems upgrading to exim4,
and got dropped from the list (presumably due to bounces), and it took me
this long to straighten it out.
Many thanks,
Zack
