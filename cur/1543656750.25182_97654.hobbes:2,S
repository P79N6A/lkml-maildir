Firstly, setting fix.line_length to zero (which the old API didn't care
about) caused one set of problems.
Secondly, the sa1100fb set_par function doesn't set the var RGB elements -
that's left to the check_var function.  Originally, we effectively did
a fb_set_var which took care of that for us.  Now we explicitly call
our check_var implementation prior to registering the framebuffer
driver with the fbcon core.
