That is -31GB unless I'm miscounting. But it needs to be >= -2GB
(31bits) 
Right now it is at -2GB + 2MB,  because it is loaded at physical +2MB
so it's convenient to identity map there. In theory you could avoid that
with some effort, but that would only buy you 2MB and would also
break some early code and earlyprintk I believe.

The kernel model relies on 32bit sign extension. This means bits [31;63] have
to be all 1

Another one I came up in the previous mail would be to do the linker reference
variable allocation in [0;2GB] positive space; but do all real references only
%gs relative. And keep the real data copy on some other address. That would
be a similar trick to the old style x86-64 vsyscalls. It gets fairly
messy in the linker map file though.
