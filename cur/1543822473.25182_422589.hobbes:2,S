I thought that part of the exercise was to allow oprofile/perfmon and nmi_watchdog
to work simultaneously, i.e., don't disable watchdog when you monitor. Leave watchdog
on and have oprofile/perfmon run with fewer counters. The alternative would be to do
what you say: disbale nmi, monitor, re-enable nmi.

On larger machines (think NUMA-style), it does not always make sense to monitor all CPUs.
