The notion of a secure stack implies that you get some kind of security
by making the stack non-executable. This theory has, to the best on
my knowledge, never been shown to have merit, much less proof. The
old games of loading executable opcodes into local data on the stack,
overwriting the return address with that data (to point to the code
you want to execute), then causing an exception (stack overrun) to
make it happen, are not something you could encounter with the current
network daemons.
You would need a local account, with root access, to even experiment.
