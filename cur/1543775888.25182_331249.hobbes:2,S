It's missing because platform_register_devices() is only intended to
be called from code areas which only registers platform devices - eg,
platform specific initialisation code.
Using platform_register_devices() from a module to register a set of
statically allocated devices is very dangerous - you should be using
platform_device_register_simple() instead.
