There is no real reason video-vesa.c couldn't do those calculations, but
it would have to get the information from the command line proper and
not just from the 16-bit vga= mode number.  That is a minor
complication, but not significant (the new setup code has a proper
command line parser.)
The desirability of it is another matter, especially since it wouldn't
let any switching happen at runtime.
