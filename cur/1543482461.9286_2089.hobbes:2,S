I have a dual PPro 200 and have run most of the development kernels w/o
problem. I recently upgraded from 2.1.130 to 2.2.0 and I am getting 
supurious APIC interrupt, ayiee, should never happen.
At first I thought it was just during kernel compilation (since I
recompiled the kernel under 2.2), but it just seems to happen
occassionally.. Not occassional enough, however, for in 10 minutes of
uptime it has appeared 12 times.
Any suggestions? Let me know and I can email my CONFIG or hardware setup.
Please CC response to nkirsch@biznatch.nick.org
Thanks,
Nick
