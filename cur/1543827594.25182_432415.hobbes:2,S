Subject: [RFC][PATCH] Avoid race w/ posix-cpu-timer and exiting tasks
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Hey Ingo,
	We've occasionally come across OOPSes in posix-cpu-timer thread (as
well as tripping over the BUG_ON(tsk->exit_state there) where it appears
the task we're processing exits out on us while we're using it. 
Thus this fix tries to avoid running the posix-cpu-timers on a task that
is exiting.
I'm not sure if it is the proper fix, so I wanted some extra eyes to
look it over. We're testing it to see if we can still trigger any of the
OOPSes (the BUG_ON is removed, so that won't catch us anymore), but if
you have any thoughts I'd be interested in them.
thanks
-john
