No, it is not a kernel limit, it is a limit to your shell (bash, for
example).  Look at xargs to get around it.
A related limit is that the popular ext2 and 3 file systems get
inefficient when directories have so many files.  The work-around for
that is to have your files either hashed or organized across a
collection of directories.
