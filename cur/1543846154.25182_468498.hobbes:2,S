The code as it was was just wrong.  There was a call to ubd_open_dev
at the start and a matching ubd_close at the end.  So far, so good,
since ubd_close inverts ubd_open_dev.  However, neither manipulates
dev->count (this is done by ubd_open/ubd_release) and the call to
ubd_add_disk indirectly calls ubd_open, which, since dev->count is
still zero redoes the initialization, leaking the descriptor and
vmalloc space allocated by the first ubd_open_dev call.
The fix is simple - there is no need for ubd_add to call ubd_open_dev
or ubd_close (ubd_file_size doesn't require the device be opened), so
the calls can simply be deleted.  With the non-count-changing
device-opening call gone, the leaks just disappear.
There are multiple things wrong with the code, many of which are still
there, but I don't see this as being an argument against this change.
It eliminates some useless code, which is good from both a maintenance
and performance standpoint.  However, leaks aside, the main benefit of
this change is that eliminates the one call to ubd_open_dev outside of
ubd_open, and thus opening stuff on the host and allocating memory is
always inside a check of dev->open.

OK, just make sure you preserve (or add) this property.

No, the bug is doing the work of opening the device outside a check of
the device refcount.

This is true - however the _open function was succeeding, so it's
irrelevant in this case.

Yes, this is one of the things wrong with the current code - the names
are messed up.
