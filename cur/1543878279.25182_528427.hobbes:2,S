it would be really nice to analyze this. Does the latest -rt patch boot 
on your box so that we could trace this regression? (I can send you a 
standalone tracing patch if it doesnt.) IIRC you reported that one of 
the early patches from Mike made your system behave good (but still not 
as good as SD) - it would be nice to try a later patch too.
basically, the current unfairness in the scheduler should be solved, one 
way or another. Good testcases were posted and there's progress.

not many - and i dont think Mike tested any of these - Mike tested 
pretty low make -j values (Mike, can you confirm?).
(I personally routinely run 'make -j 200' build jobs on my box [because
 it's the central server of a build cluster and high parallelism is
 needed to overcome network latencies], but i'm pretty special in that
 regard and i didnt use that workload as a test against any of these
 schedulers.)
