Subject: Mail error from Hotmail message (was:  patch-2.4.16-rmk1-iop310.1.gz)

I got this error in my mail software from this message:
    One or more message parts marked as
    "Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit"
    was invalid for 7Bit decoding.
Could this be caused by the ASCII 0x05,0x05 in the hotmail signature?
What is it for?
