Two weeks ago, we had:
- a bug report
- a detailed description how to possibly fix this issue
What we did NOT have was:
- any reaction by the patch author or any maintainer
  (although with the exception of Linus, the recipients of the problem
   description were exactly the same as the ones in this email)
A few days later, the patch that includes this bug was included in 
Linus' tree.
Two weeks later, the bug is still present in both latest -mm and Linus' 
tree.
Linus, please do a
  git-revert a5e1b94008f2a96abf4a0c0371a55a56b320c13e
