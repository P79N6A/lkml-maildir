   As soon as I finish writing raw write disk routines (not using kiobufs),
   we can _maybe_ get LKCD accepted one of these days, especially now that we
   don't have to build 'lcrash' against a kernel revision.  I'm in the
   middle of putting together raw IDE functions now -- see LKCD mailing
   list for details if you're curious.
Great!  Are you thinking about putting the crash dumper and the raw
write disk routines in a separate text section, so they can be located
in pages which are write-protected from accidental modification in case
some kernel code goes wild?  (Who me?  Paranoid?  :-)
