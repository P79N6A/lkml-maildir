Oops, I indeed missed that. I searched for if anyone would change that 
value, but later forgot about the other users.
A simple solution would be to move this (constant) value to a header and 
another rather simple solution would be to remove it completely, as it's 
rather bogus anyway. These users check time_adjust, which is unused in a 
NTP controlled system. The correct value to check would be the tick 
length, but I'm sure it's really worth the trouble.
bye, Roman
