Fixing the existing callers that pass a NULL file struct is a separate matter
that can be handled by a later patch, as can consolidating all the fake users.
I don't follow the reasoning behind backing out and using ioctl_by_bdev() here.
Isn't the primary reason for its existence to add a set_fs(KERNEL_DS) to the
mix?  I don't understand why device-mapper should interfere (surely
incorrectly?) at that level.
