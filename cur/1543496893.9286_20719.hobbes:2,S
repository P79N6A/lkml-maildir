Mikulas shown me and it really is problem. I was unable to ssh to our
server within _minute_ when dd ran. We tried to reproduce it on 2.0
system with scsi and it did not work. It is pretty effective DoS
attack and I think something like that happens in real life,
too. Notice that you have to _write_ on disk, reading does not work.
