     I couldn't agree more.  I worked on two large AIX boxen this
year (8- and 12-way S7As with gigs of RAM) which were getting buried
under runqueues that ran past 2000 (no typo).  The problem was not
in our software or in the kernel--it was simply very poor system
software design done by others in years past.  There is nothing that
anyone can or should do to meet such loads; instead, one should look
at fixing the broken software design causing them.
     Cheers,
