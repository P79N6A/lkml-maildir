Eew. Yes, with root, I get it with both compilers:
root@luther:~# ls -l /dev/null
crw-rw-rw-  1 root sys 1, 3 1994-07-17 19:46 /dev/null
root@luther:~# echo "main() {}" | gcc -xc - -o /dev/null
root@luther:~# ls -l /dev/null
crwxrwxrwx  1 root sys 1, 3 1994-07-17 19:46 /dev/null
root@luther:~# ls -l /dev/null
crw-rw-rw-  1 root sys 1, 3 1994-07-17 19:46 /dev/null
root@luther:~# echo "main() {}" | /usr/local/gcc4/bin/gcc -xc - -o
/dev/null
root@luther:~# ls -l /dev/null
crwxrwxrwx  1 root sys 1, 3 1994-07-17 19:46 /dev/null
Obviously gcc shouldn't do such at thing, but just as obviously, don't
build the kernel as root.
