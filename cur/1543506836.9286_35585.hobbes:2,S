I have a program that sends midi events to the /dev/midi0 device.
It open the device with open() for read/write. Sometimes it sends a lot of events
and the device stops send. (Nonblocking) Then the device is dead. I stop the process and
trying open the device and it is stil busy. The hardware is SB16 or SB128 PCI.
Im thinking of sending some IOCTL to give it a reset signal, but I cant send IOCTL
the device is busy. Ugly deadlock...
