I recall there is a patch by Michel Benoit that solves some issues on 
gettimeoffset()/gettimeofday(). It is in the ARM patch queue here :
http://www.arm.linux.org.uk/developer/patches/viewpatch.php?id=4149/1
and will be included in the upcoming kernel.
Hope that it addresses this problem and that it will help you.
