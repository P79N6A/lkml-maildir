The obvious (and very painful) answer is "compile time option".
It'd mean having two IA-64 "ports", and it'd make people with binary distributions curse
but is there any better solution ?
Basically we have a processor that can be either big or little endian, should we
treat it as two separate targets ?
We know Linux is basically endian clean, so there should be little real pain in doing this,
other than having someone booting a "wrong endianess" kernel ;)
The *BIG* plus is that there'd be a real incentive for source rather than binary releases of 
software for the IA-64 . ;).
Q: Is the IA-64 fixed endian on boot, or can it change "endianess" at runtime ?
( Nice one Richard, this one is even better flame bait than the previous few threads :) )
