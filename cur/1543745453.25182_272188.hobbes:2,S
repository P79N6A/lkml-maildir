I don't see how the OOM killer can help you here.  The OOM killer deals 
with the system being out of virtual memory; writepage is about freeing 
real memory.  The real memory allocator will wait forever if it has to for 
pageouts to complete so that it can evict a page and free up real memory.
If a pageout requires a user space process to run, and the user space 
process requires additional real memory (e.g. in order to swap something 
in from swap space) to do the pageout, you can have a deadlock.
