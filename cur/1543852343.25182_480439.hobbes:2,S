This definitely means that the IRQ subsystem works, at least here. That 
"scanned" means that the PCMCIA driver actually tested those interrupts, 
and they worked.
At that point, at least.
Of course, the "they worked" test is fairly simple, so it's by no means 
foolproof, but in general, it does sound like it all really should be ok.
Komuro, if you're a git user (or are willing to learn), and it's reliable 
with one particular card, it really would make most sense to bisect it. 
Just start off with
	git bisect start
	git bisect good v2.6.18
	git bisect bad v2.6.19-rc1
and off you go. That's a lot of commits (abotu 5000), but even if you 
don't ant to do the 12 or 13 kernel compiles and reboots that are needed 
for a full bisection,  doing just 4-5 would cut the number down a lot, and 
then you can send the bisection log out.
But testing 2.6.19-rc5 is still worth it. The APIC fixes might fix it, or 
some other changes might.
