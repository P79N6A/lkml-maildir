Subject: [PATCH]: Fix PCI sysfs file deletion
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The PCI sysfs attributes are created after the initial PCI
bus scan.  With the addition of more return value checking
and assertions in the device and sysfs layers we now can
get dumps like this on sparc64:

It's triggering because removal of the "config" PCI sysfs
file for the device fails.
On sparc64, after probing the device, we'll delete the PCI
device via pci_remove_bus_device() if we cannot find the firmware
device tree node corresponding to it.
This is fine, but at this point the sysfs files for the PCI device
won't be setup yet.
So we should not try to do anything in pci_remove_sysfs_dev_files()
if pci_sysfs_init() has not run yet.
Greg, please apply and push to Linus.  Thanks a lot!
[PCI]: Don't try to remove sysfs files before they are setup.
