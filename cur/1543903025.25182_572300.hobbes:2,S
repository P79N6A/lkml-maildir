That's actually quite confusing to the casual reader, since:

So the rule should be:
	If the SUBSYSTEM is "block" (implying major/minor are provided),
	it's a block device.
	If the SUBSYSTEM is not "block", and major/minor are provided,
	it's a char device.
	If major/minor are not provided, the event/device is not
	relevant to device node creation.
