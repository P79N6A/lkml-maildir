note that the very same bug triggers with objrmap only applied (before I
applied anon-vma and prio-tree on top of it), so at very least this is a
bug in Dave's code too. See the same BUG_ON triggering in rmap.c before
I replace it with objrmap.c in anon-vma. Almost certainly it will trigger with
your patches applied too and probably it happens with mainline 2.6 too
but nobody tested that yet.

zero page is reserved, so page_add_rmap does nothing on it, zero page is
gauranteed to have page->mapcount == 0.

page_add_rmap is a noop and the zero page has always page->mapcount == 0.
Furthermore I WARN_ON if anybody returns a page->mapping == NULL on a
non-reserved VMA, so it can't be the case (zeropage has page->mapping =
NULL).

A COW on a zero page will call page_add_rmap on the copy just fine and
it will call page_remove_rmap on the old page as well, though the
latter will be a noop for a reserved page or for a page with
page->mapping == 0 like the zero page is.

there's no bug to fix in my code as far as I can tell. You probably
overlooked the zeropage is reserved.
