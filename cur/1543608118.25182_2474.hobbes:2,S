Subject: 2xQ: Is PM + ACPI but /no/ APM a valid configuration? Interrupts enabled in APM set power state?

I am trying to debug power management on an IBM T23.
No PM, no ACPI, no APM
suspend works - i.e. doesn't crash on resume,
but 'dumbly' and doesn't restore some PCI states
(unsurprising), clock, etc., and no /proc/apm
etc.
PM, no ACPI, no APM
this seems to work, but debugging the power management
stuff suggests that the PCI drivers are never sent
suspend or resume events, which is causing the
crashes below.
PM, ACPI, no APM
This is the wierd one. I get a pile of scrolly
messages which I think is ACPI debugging
and appear to be uninterruptible - SysRq K crashes
the machine. They are attached at the bottom.
Is this a valid configuration? I can't see why
not.
PM, no ACPI, APM
Machine hangs on resume.
printk()s tell me that it successfully does
all the pm_send stuff, then calls apm_set_power_state()
(I can see this immediately before the LCD disappears).
But on resume, though the LCD comes back on, it
never gets to the printk() I inserted immediately
afterwards.
PM, ACPI, APM
as above
Also, on advice, I have APM configured to allow
interrupts (IBM laptop). So what happens if a
device interrupts as / because of the resume,
perhaps before the segment registers have
been restored, and certainly before the pm_send
stuff has gone around?
