Driver OOPS-es on handling write barrier request (on finishing pre-flush)
because REQ_STARTED flag is not set in __ide_end_request()
but I don't see how this can happen, maybe something has changed
in the block layer...  Does 2.6.14 work for you?
Does mounting ext3 with "barrier=0" option workaround the problem?
Thanks,
Bartlomiej
