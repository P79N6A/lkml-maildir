OK, thanks.  So
gregkh-driver-allow-sysfs-attribute-files-to-be-pollable.patch is the
problem.   Odd.
<looks at sysfs_poll()>
If that gets called on a top-level file in /sys, won't
filp->f_dentry->d_parent be pointing at a non-sysfs dentry?

Yeah, known problem - big messiness in scsi.  That's why -mm includes
revert-gregkh-driver-put_device-might_sleep.patch.  Looks like I need to
add revert-gregkh-driver-allow-sysfs-attribute-files-to-be-pollable.patch too ;)
