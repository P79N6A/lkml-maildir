If I press ^D, I'd expect to select the abort option (like e.g. all sane
GUIs do if you close yes/no/abort dialogs instead of selecting a button).
I can see no advantage from implementing this unexpected behaviour.

I don't understand programmers trying to go ahead even if they know they're
going the wrong way. The header file can't be found - let's see if it wasn't
needed, maybe the programmer inserted it just for fun! There is an unknown
argument '--version'? Just ignore it and start the operation, it won't have
been that important! *grrrrrr*
