Portability is relative. It's normally handled with a wrapper.
If your software is to work on a Unix or Unix-like machine, a
claim to "portability" must mean that its interface on a Unix-
like machine is either through a virtual file in '/dev' or
through a socket. This is because these are the 'standards'
that we all have to live with whether we like then or not.
Your `cdrecord -scanbus` hack to find I,J,K numbers that the
rest of your code was written to use, probably took more
time to write than a Unix wrapper which would provide the
correct (for a Unix environment) interface semantics.
Administrators need to set up symbolic links for /dev/burner
or /dev/cdreader, etc., to help cut down nuisance complaints
from users who fail to write CDs on their CD readers. This
is the de-facto Unix way. We need 'devices' in /dev.
BYW I have used your software from its inception and it
always worked well in my SCSI environment. The best working
software in the universe will not receive due credit if
it doesn't meet user (and customer) expectations. If you
are still interested in improving your generous gift to
the Linux community, you should seriously consider writing
wrappers  to address portability issues.
