I don't understand the question really.  Does the PCI spec even allow
a device to be in MSI mode by default?  Surely the OS must initialize
the address/message before the device can generate an MSI?
What device do you have in mind?  I guess the interesting case is a
PCIe device that supports MSI and MSI-X but not legacy interrupts.
However I would assume such a device would come up with both MSI and
MSI-X disabled.
