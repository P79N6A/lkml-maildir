Now that we have the dirty mmap accounting, page dirtiers should be
throttled pretty well via page writeback throttling.

Well, yes. Atomic allocations as of *today* cannot do any reclaim, and
thus they rely on kswapd to free their memory, and we keep a (not huge)
memory pool for them. They also have to be able to handle failures, and
by and large they do OK.

You can't catch that at the allocation side anyway because clean pagecache
may already exist for /tmp/foo.
We've always done pretty well (in 2.6) with correctly throttling and
limiting write(2) writes into pagecache, haven't we?
