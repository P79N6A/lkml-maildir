You might want to save and compare /proc/slabinfo before and after.
It might be things like the dcache growing out of control and not
shrinking gracefully under memory pressure, we've certainly had that
happen before. 
Or it might just be a memory leak, of course.  That too will be visible
in slabinfo if it's a slab/kmalloc leak (but obviously not if it's a
page allocator leak).
