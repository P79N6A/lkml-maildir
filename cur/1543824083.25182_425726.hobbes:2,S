Subject: [radeonfb]: unclean backward scrolling

Hi,
I'm using the radeonfb driver with a radeon 7000 with the frambuffer
at 1280x1024 on a i386 system, with a 2.6.16.17 kernel. At boot time,
if I stop the messages with CTRL+s and try look the previous messages
with CTRL+PagUp (backward scrolling) the screen become unreadable. In
fact some lengthier lines are not erased scrolling backward and some
random characters a overwritten instead. So it's very difficult to
read the messages.
I don't have such problem with the frambuffer at 1024x768.
All the previous kernels I've tried have this problem (at least up to 2.6.15).
If someone can look at this issue I can provide further information.
Many Thanks.
Cheers,
  ~ Antonio
