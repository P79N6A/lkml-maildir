Hello!

I promise you much more of boundary cases, unless
you make some windowsish sys_fork_exec_deal_with_all_the_rest(100 arguments)
Look how this works in openvz. It uses pure traditional unixish api.
Fork is not a boundary at all. To enter to a container you
do all the work in steps:
1. change accounting space (sys_setluid())
2. plain fork()
2. tune communication (pipes, ptys etc)
3. chroot()
...
N. enter container (at the moment it is ioctl on a special device, could be
		   syscall).
You can omit any step, if you need. You can add entering any subsystem,
which you invent in future. Simple and stupid. And, nevertheless, universal.
