Subject: [PATCH 07/11] [NETFILTER]: Fix DHCP + MASQUERADE problem
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us know.
------------------
In 2.6.13-rcX the MASQUERADE target was changed not to exclude local
packets for better source address consistency. This breaks DHCP clients
using UDP sockets when the DHCP requests are caught by a MASQUERADE rule
because the MASQUERADE target drops packets when no address is configured
on the outgoing interface. This patch makes it ignore packets with a
source address of 0.
Thanks to Rusty for this suggestion.
