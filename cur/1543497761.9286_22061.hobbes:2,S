Hi Everybody,
I recently (1 week ago) sent a small patch to
linux-pcisupport@@cck.uni-kl.de (as stated in include/linux/pci.h
of the 2.2.9 kernel) and got no answer back yet.
I neither found an archive of past mail, nor any website
describing how to subscribe to their list.
So I consider them _dead_ !
Please give me a pointer to someone, who I should send my little
patch (concerning the S5933 device id[1]) to.
Many thanks in advance
Ingo Oeser
[1] The current one is wrong according to the specs from AMCC.
