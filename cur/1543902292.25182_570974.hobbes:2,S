BTW I found the application: it is hddtemp
Debian description:
Utility to monitor the temperature of your hard drive
.
hddtemp will give you the temperature of your PATA, SATA or SCSI hard
drive by reading Self-Monitoring Analysis and Reporting Technology
(S.M.A.R.T.) information (on drives that support this feature). Only
modern hard drives have a temperature sensor.
