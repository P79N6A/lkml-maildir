Well, it's too ugly for words now. I shall work on it a bit.
Basically, you:
* untar linux tree into tree/, 
* make allyesconfig
  NB: I did not do this, I used my 'usual' config
* compile it with MEASURE_INLINES, saving
  make output in make_inline.log
* run 'process' script (get a list of inlines)
* run process2 (add functions to .c files)
* run make again, >make_test.log
* run process3 (file+line of errors)
* run process4 (comment out error lines)
  NB: BUG! sh 'read -r line' strips spaces
* run make again, no need to save space
* run process5 (calculate size using nm)
* run process6 (sorting)
* run process7 (throw away 1 caller inlines)
  NB: needs rewriting in e.g. python, outrageously slow
