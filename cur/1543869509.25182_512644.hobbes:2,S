Subject: [RFC] Fast assurate clock readable from user space and NMI handler
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Hi,
I am trying to improve the Linux kernel time source so it can be read
without seqlock from NMI handlers. I have also seen some interest for
such an accurate monotonic clock readable from user space. It mainly
implies an atomic update of the time value. I am also trying to figure a
way to support architectures with multiple CPUs with non-synchronized
TSCs.
I would like to have your comments on the following idea.
Thanks in advance,
Mathieu
Monotonic accurate time
The goal of this design is to provide a monotonic time :
Readable from userspace without a system call
Readable from NMI handler
Readable without disabling interrupts
Readable without disabling preemption
Only one clock source (most precise available : tsc)
Support architectures with variable TSC frequency.
Main difference with wall time currently implemented in the Linux kernel : the
time update is done atomically instead of using a write seqlock. It permits
reading time from NMI handler and from userspace.

	u64 tsc;

	/* Get frequency */
	/* Reset cpus to 0 ns, 0 tsc, start their tsc. */
}
/* After a CPU comes back from hlt */
/* The trick is to sync all the other CPUs on the first CPU up when they come
 * up. If all CPUs are down, then there is no need to increment the walltime :
 * let's simply define the useful walltime on a machine as the time elapsed
 * while there is a CPU running. If we want, when no cpu is active, we can use
 * a lower resolution clock to somehow keep track of walltime. */
wake_from_hlt()
{
	/* TODO */
}
/* Read time from anywhere in the kernel. Return time in walltime. (ns) */
/* If the update_count changes while we read the context, it may be invalid.
 * This would happen if we are scheduled out for a period of time long enough to
 * permit 2 frequency changes. We simply start the loop again if it happens.
 * We detect it by comparing the update_count running counter.
 * We detect preemption by incrementing a counter sched_nr within schedule(). 
 * This counter is readable by user space through the vsyscall page. */
