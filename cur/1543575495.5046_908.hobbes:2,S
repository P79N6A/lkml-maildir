asm/io.h uses out of line function only when CONFIG_ALPHA_GENERIC is
defined, otherwise it uses (take writel as an example) __raw_writel that
IMHO need to be defined in core_t2.h.
core_t2.h is the only core_*.h file that does not define it and this is
why I've proposed that patch.
Perhaps there is a reason I don't understand and in this case I want to
apologize and I'd like to ask you to explain me what I'm missing.
