No i2c_ec. Maybe your distribution is loading it by default for
everyone then.
Either way, it means you can forget right away about sbs, if i2c_ec
didn't register a device, sbs cannot be used.

Only a couple EEPROMs and a clock chip on your SMBus, it's very
unlikely that ACPI accesses this at all. So I'd be surprised that
i2c-piix4 is causing any trouble.
This leaves asus_acpi as the only candidate? Better unload _all_ the
drivers you consider as suspects, and see if it changes anything. I
guess not.
