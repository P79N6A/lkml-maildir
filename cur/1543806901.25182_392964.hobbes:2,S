That sounds like a different module; I'm using 'bttv' module.
I've tried 
rmmod bttv
rmmod tuner
rmmod compat_ioctl32
rmmod v4l2-common
rmmod tveeprom
rmmod videodev
rmmod ir-common
insmod v4l2-common.ko
insmod tveeprom.ko
insmod videodev.ko
insmod compat_ioctl32.ko
insmod tuner.ko
insmod ir-common.ko
insmod bttv.ko
on
$ hg log|head

summary:     bugfix [5895], return an error value
and I can reproduce the situation.
The current situation being that no images come through mencoder,
which probably means it's not
1. tuning the tuner (If there has been a i2c breakage, sounds possible)
2. getting the images
or both.
I am able to see TV through xawtv, and I am assuming that means it's
working with v4l1 compatibility layer of some sort.
regards,
	junichi
