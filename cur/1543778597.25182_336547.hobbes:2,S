Hi Lee,
Sorry for the confusion - the sound driver with kernel 2.4.27 works - it
looks like it is oss ( it is a
german knoppix cd and I don't parse german ), there is no /proc/asound
directory. Also I dont
have to provide acpi=off pci=noacpi,usepirqmask with the knoppix cd, but
I do when I boot the
2.6.12 kernel.
on 2.4.27 the kernel modules for sound are:
soundcore, ac97_codec, maestro3
so i am saying:
  2.4 + the OSS driver works and 2.6 + ALSA does not.
Thanks for the response.
Steve
