unshare does return EINVAL if signal handler unsharing is attempted by a
process that is currently sharing its signal handler with another 
process. However,
because of the interaction between signal handlers and vm, CLONE_SIGHAND
is set anytime vm unsharing is attempted. That is, if you are trying to 
unshare
vm, you must unshare signal handlers. But if they are not being shared 
in the
first place, there is no need to prevent unsharing of vm.
Therefore, unshare returns EINVAL if unsharing of signal handlers and/or vm
is attempted by a process that is sharing its signal handler.
