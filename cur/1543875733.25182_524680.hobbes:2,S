Mainline deals with lseek on proc entries as follows:
* use default_llseek()
* but if proc entry set ->llseek via ->proc_fops, use custom llseek
With introduction of proxying, ->llseek was suddenly set on all proc
entries, so default_llseek() was never used, but -E started to be
returned for all of them that were relying on default_llseek().
So this patch brings proc_reg_llseek() in sync with vfs_llseek().
