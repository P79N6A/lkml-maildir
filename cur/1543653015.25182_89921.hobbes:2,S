I did this a couple of years ago for my research OS (Scout) and it
worked great.  It did UDP over Ethernet and was about 300 lines of
code.  Rather than using the normal UDP stack, the kernel gdb I/O ran
directly on top of the network driver to reduce the risk of getting
hit by a breakpoint that is in the way of the gdb I/O.  The code is
almost too trivial to mention, but for anyone interested, it can still
be found at:
	
http://www.cs.arizona.edu/scout/software.html
The relevant files are scout/sys/ai/kgdb_net.c and
scout/router/tulip/tulip.c (the latter contains the Ethernet driver
portion).

PS: IIRC, the kgdb protocol has a simple checksumming protocol so it
    can deal with packet losses (perhaps not very gracefully, but on a
    LAN it's not going to be a problem anyhow).
