Yes. 
Sorry. My explanation was not enought.

The meminfo showed mlocked, unevictable pages was zero. 
My kernel version is 2.6.29-rc2.

My system was not reclaim mode. It could be called following path. 
exit_mmap -> munlock_vma_pages_all->munlock_vma_page->try_to_munlock->
try_to_unmap_file->try_to_mlock_page

Hmm... My test result is as follow. 
1) without munlockall
before:
root@barrios-target-linux:~# tail -8 /proc/vmstat 
unevictable_pgs_culled 0
unevictable_pgs_scanned 0
unevictable_pgs_rescued 0
unevictable_pgs_mlocked 0
unevictable_pgs_munlocked 0
unevictable_pgs_cleared 0
unevictable_pgs_stranded 0
unevictable_pgs_mlockfreed 0
root@barrios-target-linux:~# cat /proc/meminfo | egrep 'Mlo|Unev'
Unevictable:           0 kB
Mlocked:               0 kB
after:
root@barrios-target-linux:~# tail -8 /proc/vmstat 
unevictable_pgs_culled 369
unevictable_pgs_scanned 0
unevictable_pgs_rescued 388
unevictable_pgs_mlocked 392
unevictable_pgs_munlocked 387
unevictable_pgs_cleared 1
unevictable_pgs_stranded 0
unevictable_pgs_mlockfreed 0
root@barrios-target-linux:~# cat /proc/meminfo | egrep 'Mlo|Unev'
Unevictable:           8 kB
Mlocked:               8 kB
after dropping cache
root@barrios-target-linux:~# cat /proc/meminfo | egrep 'Mlo|Unev'
Unevictable:           4 kB
Mlocked:               4 kB
2) with munlockall 
barrios-target@barrios-target-linux:~$ tail -8 /proc/vmstat
unevictable_pgs_culled 0
unevictable_pgs_scanned 0
unevictable_pgs_rescued 0
unevictable_pgs_mlocked 0
unevictable_pgs_munlocked 0
unevictable_pgs_cleared 0
unevictable_pgs_stranded 0
unevictable_pgs_mlockfreed 0
barrios-target@barrios-target-linux:~$ cat /proc/meminfo | egrep 'Mlo|Unev'
Unevictable:           0 kB
Mlocked:               0 kB
after
root@barrios-target-linux:~# tail -8 /proc/vmstat
unevictable_pgs_culled 369
unevictable_pgs_scanned 0
unevictable_pgs_rescued 389
unevictable_pgs_mlocked 389
unevictable_pgs_munlocked 389
unevictable_pgs_cleared 0
unevictable_pgs_stranded 0
unevictable_pgs_mlockfreed 0
root@barrios-target-linux:~# cat /proc/meminfo | egrep 'Mlo|Unev'
Unevictable:           0 kB
Mlocked:               0 kB
Both tests have to show same result. 
But is didn't. 
I think it's not per-cpu problem. 
When I digged in the source, I found that. 
In case of test without munlockall, try_to_unmap_file calls try_to_mlock_page 
since some pages are mapped several vmas(I don't know why that pages is shared 
other vma in same process. One of page which i have seen is test program's 
first code page[page->index : 0 vma->vm_pgoff : 0]. It was mapped by data vma, too). 
Other vma have VM_LOCKED.
So try_to_unmap_file calls try_to_mlock_page. Then, After calling 
successful down_read_try_lock call, mlock_vma_page increased mlocked
counter again. 
In case of test with munlockall, try_to_mlock_page's down_read_trylock 
couldn't be sucessful. That's because munlockall called down_write.
At result, try_to_mlock_page cannot call try_to_mlock_page. so, mlocked counter 
don't increased. I think it's not right. 
But fortunately Mlocked number is right. :(
