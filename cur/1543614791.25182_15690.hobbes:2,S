OK, the framebuffer driver is failing to mark the mmapped vma as
VM_IO, so the kernel is trying to dump the framebuffer device
to the core file, takes a recursive fault and deadlocks.
Simplest possible fix is to mark the framebuffer as not dumpable
for x86.

However I don't see why _any_ architecture wants framebuffer contents
to be included in core files.  It sounds risky.
So the setting of VM_IO could be simply hoisted outside the forest
of ifdefs.  Comments, anyone?
