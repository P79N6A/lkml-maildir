Hi,
I have recently upgraded my kernel to 2.6.21 from 2.6.20 and that has
caused a problem mounting an encrypted partition using dm-crypt.
In my init script, I use cryptsetup to create device which I use to
mount an encrypted partition. Since I changed to 2.6.21 the mount fails
returning an EINVAL status which doesn't make much sense because the
init script is unchanged and works if reverted to 2.6.20.
Any ideas? How can I debug this problem? I'm not subscribed to lkml so
please cc in your response.
