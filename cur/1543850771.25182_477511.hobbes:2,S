Hello,
I would like to take a high accuracy timestamp whenever data is
received on the serial port.
I think the best place to do this is in the tty_flip_buffer_push
method of the tty_io.c file.
   2652 void tty_flip_buffer_push(struct tty_struct *tty)
   2653 {
   2654     if (tty->low_latency)
   2655         flush_to_ldisc((void *) tty);
   2656     else
   2657         schedule_delayed_work(&tty->flip.work, 1);
   2658 }
I would buffer the timestamps, and access them using an ioctl.
Is this the best way of doing this?
I am currently using the 2.6.15 kernel.
Regards,
Anindha
