It was on slashdot a couple of days ago, and the commentary there was as
idiotic as one would expect.  E.g., Thompson is bitter that Linux has
completely overshadowed Plan 9 and he can't accept that a 21 year old kid
did a better job with the Unix idea than Thompson was able to do with all
the power of AT&T behind him.  (And that example is not even from some
random slashdot anonymous poster...it's from a well known Linux advocate).
