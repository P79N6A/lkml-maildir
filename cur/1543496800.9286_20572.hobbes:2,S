Hi,
I made a big, big mistake.  I had a version that worked for my
card from about a year ago, but I needed to reorganize my disk
to make room for VMWARE.  When I did so, I lost the source
that included plug and play support.  The current sources that
I am able to locate do not have plug and play support.  Disabling
plug and play does not make my card any more visible to the
driver.  So, I either have to re-obtain the source with P&P support,
or I have to figure out how to get the current version to recognize
my card.
Name:	Intel EtherExpressPro/10+  (ISA bus card)
IO Addr: 0x210
IRQ:	10
I have the DOS program for turning on and off P&P, assigning
IO Addr's and IRQ's, in case eepro.c has certain preferences.
It was not obvious how the IO Addrs got searched, tho.
THANK YOU!!
