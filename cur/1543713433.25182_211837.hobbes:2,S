Subject: [PATCH][MINOR] define default SEEK_SET, SEEK_CUR and SEEK_END
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/4/5/50

this is a very minor patch to include the various llseek SEEK macro's into 
linux/fs.h
perhaps there's a reason this hasn't been included yet, but a simple grep 
showed me that I'm not the only one defining these in my drivers (which IMHO 
is bad). I simply copied these lines from libc's fnctl.h, including the 
original commentary. 
By the way, can someone tell me if I should cc: these minor patches to a 
specific maintainer?
