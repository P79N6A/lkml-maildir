This is why I decided to pass the cs table as platform
data when an adapter is registered. This way you don't
have to try to find out an adapters bus number as the
adapter has the cs table in it, but because it was
passed in as platform data it still abstracts that
from the adapter driver. Simple, yet effective :)
Have you looked at the patch which I sent?
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0509.0/0817.html
I would appreciate any comments on this approach.

Yes, but not on a 8051 bassed Cypress USB chip ;)
