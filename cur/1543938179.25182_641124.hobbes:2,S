Hmm.. That's not what I hear from Mark and vendor contacts.  They say
30secs is more than enough.  I actually am thinking about reducing it to
15secs (not for FLUSH of course) as many SFF controllers report
transmission failure as timeouts.  Of course, if we're ticking the timer
while the command is not in flight, that's a bug.  If there are cases
where 30 secs isn't enough, can you please point me to those reports?
Thanks.
