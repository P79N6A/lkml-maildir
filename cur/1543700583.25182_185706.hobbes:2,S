Subject: synaptics mouse jitter in 2.6.0

I am running Fedora Core 1 updated on a Presario 12XL325 laptop.  For a 
long time during the 2.5 series I couldn't use the synaptics support.  As 
a result, I haven't tested this for some time.  I just compiled a fresh 
2.6.0 tree, included synaptics support and now I am getting mouse jitter.
The easiest way to see this is to open Mozilla and go to a page with a lot 
of text links such as a news site with links to a number of stories.  
With synaptics support compiled in I get side to side jitter when moving 
the mouse over a link.  It looks as if my finger has a nervous twitch in 
it.  Then, when I take my finger off the touchpad to click on the link, 
the mouse cursor jumps about an eighth of an inch in a random direction.  It 
is very annoying since the jump takes it off the link and I can't click on 
it.
Compiling synaptics support out gets me back to a stable mouse cursor.
