  Note that in lircd, you should use the input device driver
("devinput"). The saa7134 driver will create a random input event device
for the events; I use this udev rule to create a /dev/remote symlink
pointing at the right device:
	KERNEL="event*", SYSFS{name}="saa7134 IR*", NAME="input/%k", SYMLINK="remote"
  Furthermore, especially if you have problems with lircd, having the
full-blown daemon for the event interface may not be worth it. There is
a standalone inputlircd package containing a much simpler daemon which
is compatible with lirc client applications but takes the events just
from the input devices. You can run it e.g. like:
	/usr/sbin/inputlircd /dev/remote -g -m 0
  You can find an example mplayer lirc configuration at:
