        if (idedisk_supports_lba48(id)) {
                /* drive speaks 48-bit LBA */
                drive->select.b.lba = 1;
                drive->capacity64 = id->lba_capacity_2;
                if (hpa)
                        idedisk_check_hpa(drive);
                if (drive->addressing == 0 && drive->capacity64 > (1ULL)<<28) {
                        /* FIXME:  most controllers that won't do LBA48 with

                        drive->capacity64 = (1ULL)<<28;
                }

This is not sufficient?
