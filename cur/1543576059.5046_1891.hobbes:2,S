Uhm. First of all, you really need to supply information on what
kernel-version this is. Any hardware information is useful too. And
the oops seem to come from klogd, right? klogd has a horrific tendency
of destroying all information in the oops, thus it's recommended to
call klogd with the '-x' argument to tell it not to decode oops:es.
Then, when you get an oops, run it through ksymoops.
