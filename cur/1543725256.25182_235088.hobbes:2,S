unless I'm mistaken, it will be the shell which will open /proc/self/mem,
so if it doesn't have correct rights, even the setuidapp will not have
access to it because the shell will not be able to open the file.

Hmm, this is an interesting case. What exactly is passed then ? You agree
that the shell opens its own memory map on fd 0 then execs setuidapp
which will have it on stdin. But will the fd contents be automatically
replaced with the new process' memory map or will it still be the shell's
until this last reference is dropped ?
Cheers,
Willy
