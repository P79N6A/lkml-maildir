Besides, this may violate POSIX too ;-) It says something like "dot-dot
is the parent of the predecessor" (don't have The Book with me right
now).

Hmm, this can create a subtle DoS attack for user-accessible mount:
Bad guy				Good guy
cd /home/goodguy/floppy
# sits there with an evil	mount ~/floppy	-> EBUSY
# smile and waits		fuser -k ~/floppy  -> EPERM (*)
				Mail -s "heeeelllp" root
				...
(* or doesn't see the processes in the first place, depending on
   /proc permissions)
It may also be quite inconvenient in the incremental construction of
a fully functional system environment where you launch some demons
on a partial system, then mount more stuff. E.g. PCMCIA vs. NFS.
This is admittedly somewhat exotic.
