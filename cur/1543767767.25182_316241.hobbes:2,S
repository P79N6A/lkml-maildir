Filesystems exported by NFS _will_ get iget() called for recently-
deleted inodes. JFFS2 and (I believe) NTFS also do internal things which
end up having the same effect.
The premise is simple: regardless of who calls iget() and when they do
it, the VFS should not call the filesystem's read_inode() method twice
consecutively for the same inode without ever calling clear_inode() or
delete_inode() in between.
That's what __wait_on_freeing_inode() was introduced for -- so we can
make sure the clear_inode() call actually happened before we call
read_inode() again for the same inode. Unfortunately there is still a
code path where we can get it wrong, and that's what Artem is fixing.

That comment isn't true any more. Look at what __wait_on_freeing_inode()
actually does, and observe the fact that all its callers actually loop
and start again after calling it. 
The current implementation of __wait_on_freeing_inode() waits until it
_might_ have changed, not until it _has_ changed. That's why it's OK for
it just to be a yield() or a wait on a bit_waitqueue.
I'm not convinced I _like_ that implementation, mind you -- it's changed
since I last looked at it. But I don't see that there's anything
strictly broken about it.
