Dude, this is not the right forum for these types of
questions.  You need to look at some good general
texts.  I don't know if you can get a copy of Steven's
or other general Unix programming text, but that's
what would help you the most.  Anyway, here's an
example for you.  The C compiler in general treats a
function name as a type of pointer, similar to an
array base pointer in that you cannot modify it, but
you can de-reference it.
/* Crude demo program for calling a function
 * by indirect means and supplying arguments.
 *
 * Yes, it's GPL.  :-)
 */
#include <stdio.h>
int foo(char *message)
{
  int error = 0;
  if (message)
    printf("%s\n", message);
  else
    error = 1;
  return error;
}
int call_a_function(int (*func)(char *), char *arg)
{
  return (*func)(arg);
} 
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
  int (*func)(char *);
  char *arg;
  if (argc == 2) {
    func = foo;
    arg  = argv[1];
    return call_a_function(func, arg);
  } else {
    return 1;
  }
}
