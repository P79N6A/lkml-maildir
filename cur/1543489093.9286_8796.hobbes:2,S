5
The reason for the small number is that the routine that parses the
path name in the kernel does actually recurse on symlinks. Kernel
stack space is very limited (~6K - stack space for interrupt handlers
on 2.2). To avoid overflowing the kernel stack the maximum nesting
has to be limited. AFAIK there are no plans to change it.
