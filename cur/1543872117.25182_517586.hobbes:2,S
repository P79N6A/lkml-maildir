Your patch still does not do conversions of existing user space visible
'struct loop_info64' which is pretty much cast in stone. Blindly overwriting
larger structure over smaller user space buffer of existing userspace
binaries is the wrong way to do this.
There was a time when folks at least pretended that breaking user space ABI
was not tolerable.
