This isn't for "raw" protocol. It's for raw _HDLC_ (or "just" HDLC),
so I think a better name is still hdlc_proto.

I want to avoid such a union, because it's possible some of future member
structs will be large.

And here. It's currently impossible, as if_settings must be 16 bytes long
at most. Unless, of course, we have a variable-sized ifreq.
