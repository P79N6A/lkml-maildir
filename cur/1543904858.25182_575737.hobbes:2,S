Hm, when cramming cxfs into 4k at sgi, I had a patch that did just that
for debugging (warn about encroaching on 4k without actually tipping
over, with a settable threshold...)
Maybe I should resurrect it & send it out...
(FWIW I think I recall that the warning itself sometimes tipped the
scales enough on 4k stacks to bring the box down)
