Given your involvement with Linux, probably yes, but it's really up to
you. You should be aware, though, that just yesterday I got an automated
e-mail saying that they were 95% booked (remember that attendance is
capped at 500). So if you should decide to go, now is the time ...

Gee ... I can't really say I have definitive answer to that. From
personal experience, I can tell you that there are people from all
levels of involvement that go in there, from core hackers to just
simple users. The real key of OLS is the networking you get to do
with other people (i.e. meeting people in the hallways and
discussing issues which are hard to resolve on a mailing list.)
Not to mention the beer drinking ... ;)
