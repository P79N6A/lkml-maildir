Hi guys,
I have an old SMC card named SMC EtherCard Plus Elite 16 Combo (WD 8013EW or 
8013EWC)
it should work with module wd.
Under win95 :) it works great with
io=0x300 irq=15 mem=0xc8000 mem_end=0xcvfff
When I modprobe wd with these params, both 2.4 and 2.6 kernels tells me
No wd80x3 card found (io=0x300)
PLS help me. Where is problem???
Michal
