> it is definitely NOT my job to repair errors that other responsibility-free people pushed into vanilla mainline without the slightest test effort in some mm-tree for example. Who wasted it must repair it, without the slightest discussion!
You're assuming the author didn't test it. For things like floppy.c,
it's possible it was tested and worked on their system just fine, but
is broken on yours. As you can replicate the problem, you're the
natural person to help narrow down the cause. This is the way all
development works, not just Linux or free software.
Please start by assuming that people mean well and are trying to do
the right thing, and you'll get a lot more productive responses.

And please remember that the vast majority of us, just like you, are volunteers.
