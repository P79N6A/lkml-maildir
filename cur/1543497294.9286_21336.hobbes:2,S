Ted,
Does your system seem to lock up?  Almost no keyboard or mouse response?
Does it feel like Netscape has exited abnormally and is still running as a
runaway background process, consuming 99+% of your CPU cycles?
If so, this is a familiar problem with Netscape Navigator 4.0x and 4.5x.
It is not Linux-specific.  I know from personal experience that it also
affects Solaris and 95/NT.  Some think it's a bug in Java and recommend
disabling that functionality.  I don't think anybody knows for sure.  With
a little patience you can usually Telnet into an affected workstation and
kill the runaway process.
Netscape has just released a 4.6 version, but it's too early to tell if it
suffers from the same problem.
