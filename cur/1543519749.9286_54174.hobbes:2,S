On 17 Dec, Alan Cox scribbled:

excellent - so i coudl get a speedup on smp boxes... tiem to write and
benchmark... now i just have the problm of keping threads around...
sinbce it's meant to be transparent to the calling process (the callign
process need not know anything about threads.. the lib figures the best
number of threads and handles creating them etc.) ... i'll porbabl;y
have to adda flush_threads(); call to delete any idle threads if the
callign process ownt need to do any rendering for a while...
