What I was thinking is just a generic way where an application/kernel module
can ask the question to a block device: 
tell me all areas where I can seek independently.
The return would be a list of (offset, length) pairs where you can seek
independently. For devices that do not support geometry reporting that is 
only a single pair. That notion can be easily generalized for LVM and RAID
(they just combine the seekarea lists of the underlying devices, and add
their own information about device boundaries) 
At least XFS seems to make use of such information (just that it can't get
it currently on Linux, only on Irix I assume)
