What about denying students permissions to change all unwanted
<foo> on the system? They propably don't need to be root.

Disable kernel modules at all. Compile in what you need, and kick
out all unwanted stuff. Disable booting from anything else than
harddisk or network...

A speaker is basically an inductor. Together with the driving circuit,
it may form a resonant circuit. If you drive it exactly with the resonant
frequency[1], you might be able to overheat it. But take care, not to
burn your CPU too, when you reach microwave frequencies and get electromagnetic
waves reflected in the computer's case. Cross-check with Maxwell's
equations! ;-)
OTOH the students propably learn more in hacking a linux system than in any
other lesson. Tell them that the first one gets an A who can get real speech
output working on the PC speaker.
