Well... input already has 'pseudokey' for lid, and yes, you
probably can monitor cover, memory cards and cables from userspace,
already... as you do. Cover, and maybe even cards/cables could be
integrated with input infrastructure, too.
(Still waiting for you to start selling those cool phones in czech
republic :-).

Same races are inside kernel, too.

Actually, I believe right solution is to provide one, unified,
monitoring daemon, using whatever interfaces are available. (+ add
missing functionality to the kernel, if neccessary).
