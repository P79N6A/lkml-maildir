Distros might patch their kernel to support this feature and enable it,
therefore you MUST NOT release new features AT ALL!!!1 - NOT
If a distro decides to enable a non-backward-compatible feature without
warning, it's their fault.
BTW: Upgrading a filesystem by using mount options _and_ forcing that
option to be supplied on subsequent mounts is a BUG. If should be what
current code demands, it should be fixed ASAP. I hope that's not what
the current code does.
