Part of the code looks bogus though.
Linus, would it be possible to have a rule in place
that nobody submits VM code unless they accompany it
with an explanation of _why_ their code is supposed
to work?
There seem to be too many "random tweaks" in the current
VM code where nobody has an explanation of why the code works and
what exactly it is supposed to do...

Rik
