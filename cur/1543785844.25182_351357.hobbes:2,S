Without -l80, this crap takes up fewer lines.  Such things usually
occur in 500+ line functions, not counting Lindent expansion.  Getting
a fair amount of those lines on the screen helps when fixing things
up.
But that's just my personal approach.  As long as the results are
sane, it doesn't really matter.

You're lucky.  I've had to deal with code where the diff with
pre-Lindent version was completely pointless.  Original was so broken,
there was no room for regressions.
