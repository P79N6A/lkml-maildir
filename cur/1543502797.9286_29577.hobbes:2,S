Larry,
Since you've obviously talked to a lot of good people on this, I was
wondering if you could talk about the only issue I haven't heard you bring
up which is frequently brought up by the LWP/user-thread-scheduler folks.
What about kernel run-queue length?  It seems that I've heard the argument
made that LWP's keep you from spending a long time in the kernel scheduler,
which I could see might actually be a good thing.
