event-scan is called every 30 seconds.  FW has to queue them.
If you are seeing a different pile of messages, I would imagine the
messages that popped out are not coming from event-scan then.  Might be
last_error, which messages do not come in from event-scan.  I can see
them not being logged in early boot.  
A problem I could see, is if we make an rtas call before the VM
is up.  The kmalloc for last_error won't like that.
