How do I list *all* the checksums inside a given module?
For example, I want to know the checksum for "struct_module" in test.ko
$ grep struct_module Module.symvers
0x71d1e11f      struct_module   vmlinux EXPORT_SYMBOL
That's for the kernel.
$(MAGIC_COMMAND_TO_DUMP_CHECKSUMS) test.ko | grep struct_module
=> ...
