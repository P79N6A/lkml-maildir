Afternoon all..
Apologies for two posts in quick succession, but having not read the 
pci.ids file properly (trying to finish all work for the year today) I 
didn't get the latest one from pciids.sf.net, so the patch file that's 
online (same address) now updates to the latest pci.ids (23/12/2003)
http://digital.mgpenguin.net/linux/patch-2.6.0.pci-ids/patch.2.6.0.pci-ids.diff
Updates pci.ids to latest version (23/12/2003)
Cheers
