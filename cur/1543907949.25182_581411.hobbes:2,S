Right, it maintains two indices, one from the devpath to the /dev-name,
and one from the /dev-name to the devpath.

Maybe, yes.

No, no idea.

You have to explicitely handle partitions by looking at the minor
number. They are not registered in the kobj_map.

In the kobj_map is only the minor _range_ of the subsystem, which is
able to resolve the minor to the object.

Same here.

We probably want to extend kobj_map with something where _every_ device
is registered, not only the "handler" for a region of devices.
Today, when you open a device, the "driver" gets called and it looks up
the device by traversing over a list of known devices, or some using idr
internally for this. In /proc/devices are the registered "handlers", you
can't get more than this. The "mem" entry there, is what you are looking
up, but which device (devpath) it is, is hidden inside the mem class.
Seems block devices are special here, and register every genhd directly
and make them accessible the way you try to do it. Not sure if that will
work for all block devices in all cases though.
Would be nice if generic kernel code (the kobj_map) could just return a
pointer back to the kobject for _every_ major/minor combination, instead
of only the pointer into the subsystem (which registered a range). Today
every subsystem implements its own way of doing the lookup for the
object the minor number belongs to. That would be the right place to
solve this problem. :)
