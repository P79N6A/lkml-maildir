I feel this topic is going somewhere else ;) ... but if you need your
processes to share memory, and hence you would like them to be threads,
you're very likely going to have some form of syncronization mechanism to
access the shared area, don't you? So, isn't it better to have two
separate tasks, that can freely access the memory w/out locks instead of N
threads?
