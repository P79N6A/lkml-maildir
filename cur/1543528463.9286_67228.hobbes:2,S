Hiya, gang.
I have an odd problem and I hope this is the place to ask for help.
We set up a Pentium-III box with a number of aliased ethernet
interfaces on it.  These interfaces are on different subnets, to wit:
	ifconfig eth0   10.1.1.1  netmask 255.255.255.64
	ifconfig eth0:1 10.1.1.65 netmask 255.255.255.64
	ifconfig eth0:2 10.2.1.1  netmask 255.255.255.64
and so on (those are just examples).  We've found that, over time,
the eth0:x interfaces disappear and can not be brought back up without
a reboot.  My questions are:
	1.	Has anyone else experienced this problem?
	2.	If so, what's the fix?
I have no compunctions about mucking about in the kernel or drivers.
I'm an old hacker from way back.  The actual configuration of the
box (actually several boxes, the problem isn't unique to just one) is:
	Pentium-III, 500MHz or better
	Intel 440GX motherboard
	256 to 512MB RAM
	13GB EIDE disk
	Intel EtherPro 10/100Base-T ethernet cards
