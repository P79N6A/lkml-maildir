Sorry if this has been asked of you before, but what happens if you put just
the 64 meg module in?

My instinct is the pc100 ram being run at 133.  Sometimes you get away with
it(my pre-ratings, but supposed to be pc66 - hyundai ram runs at 100 just
fine, but won't go any higher), and maybe your new 64 megger can't do it.
