Yes. Just get back up using the floppy boot disk that you must
have made. Then look in /boot. You should see boot.0800. This
is 512k in size. It is the original boot sector. Now, make damn
sure that you know the raw device used to boot the machine!
It is probably /dev/hda if you have IDE drives or /dev/sda if
you have SCSI, just do `od /dev/whatever` and if the Disk drive
LED comes on, you have found it.
Then, simply:
	cp /boot/boot.0800 /dev/whatever
Since boot.0800 is already the correct length, you don't have to
use anything else.
