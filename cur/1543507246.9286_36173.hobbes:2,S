Hallo kernel developers,
after upgrade from 2.3.5 and 2.2.8 to 2.3.14 and 2.3.15 I have found two
troubles:
-- My SCSI AHA1510 (with no BIOS) gives message: no hosts found.
-- Parport (or status readback) doesn't work with PC-parport and HP printer.
Both these functions were fully functional with both old kernels.
I don't know if these problems are independent or its trouble of
sharing some resources.
