It should not be world-writeable, IMHO. So the only one who can feed entropy
there is root, who should know aht (s)he's doing ...
Here (SuSE Linux 7.x), it is 644:
crw-r--r--    1 root     root       1,   8 Dec 17 22:41 /dev/random
crw-r--r--    1 root     root       1,   9 Dec 17 22:41 /dev/urandom
