I think even if memory allocation fails while making a cpuset exclusive,
we would still want have the cpuset marked exclusive. Dynamic scheduler
domains is just one implication of making a cpuset exclusive. There
maybe other implications (like only administrator controls what tasks
run in a exclusive cpuset?) which we want to retain even when there is
mem allocation failure while building dyn sched domains.
Paul can probably clarify this much better than me!
