Does anyone know how to enable caching on a mylex AcceleRAID 170 (aka
DAC960) SCSI controller?  We've got the bkbits.net data mirrored at
rackspace.com but the controllers are read and write cache disabled.
I read the driver source and it doesn't offer this ability via the
/proc configuration space which is where I would have expected it.
Is this a bios only thing?
