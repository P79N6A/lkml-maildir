For now I think it's easier to just revert the change to use find, I 
posted the patch for this already a few days ago.
I don't know if it really makes sense to change the rules for this now, 
apparently people are using this, it may not be perfect, but I think in 
the end it's just a matter of taste.

This reverts part of the localversion patch, which now already got into
git. It removes the unnecessary find call, with the simpler $(notdir ...)
fix.
