No, it's mostly just adding new debug stuff.  And we'd need to add
additional anotations to those few semaphores which are used as non-mutexes
to support that new debug stuff.
That's if the new debugging stuff is actually useful.  I'm not sure it is,
really - I can't think of any kernel bugs which these features would have
exposed.  Although I think Ingo found some, but I don't recall what they
were.

No they haven't - they're basically unchanged from four years ago (at
least).

Well I think diligence requires that we be able to demonstrate why it's not
possible.
It's plain dumb for us to justify a fancy-pants new system based on
features which we could have added to the old one, no?

There's no need for two sets of behaviour.  What I'm saying is that we
could add similar debugging features to semaphores (if useful).  Yes, we
would have to tell the kernel at the source level to defeat that debugging
if a particular lock isn't being used as a mutex.  That's rather less
intrusive than adding a whole new type of lock.  But I'd question the value
even of doing that, given the general historical non-bugginess of existing
semaphore users.
