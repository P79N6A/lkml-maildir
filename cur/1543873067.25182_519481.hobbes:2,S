Hello Ingo,
After talking to Con over IRC (and if I can summarize it), he's wondering if
properly nicing those tasks, as previously mention in user emails, would solve
this potential user reported regression or is something additional needed. It
seems like folks are happy with the results once the nice tweeking is done.
This is a huge behavior change after all to scheduler (just thinking out loud).
