How much performance does it cost?  What kind of workloads would it show
up under?

Well, the only real problem is that the pages are returned to the free
pool and reallocated while still being part of a mapping.  If the pages
are still owned by the filesystem/pagecache, then there's no problem.
What's the lifetime of things being vmapped/unmapped in xfs?  Are they
necessarily being freed when they're unmapped, or could unmapping of
freed memory be more immediate than other memory?
Maybe it just needs a notifier chain or something.
