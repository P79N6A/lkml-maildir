management n.
1. Corporate power elites distinguished primarily by their distance from
actual productive work and their chronic failure to manage (see also suit).
Spoken derisively, as in "Management decided that ...". 2. Mythically, a
vast bureaucracy responsible for all the world's minor irritations.
Hackers' satirical public notices are often signed `The Mgt'; this derives
from the "Illuminatus" novels (see the Bibliography in Appendix C).
