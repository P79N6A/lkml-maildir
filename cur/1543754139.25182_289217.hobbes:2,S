Subject: [PATCH][0/12] InfiniBand: updates for 2.6.11-rc2
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Here are updates since the last merge of drivers/infiniband taken from
the OpenIB repository.  A couple small fixes, the addition of "issm"
device support to allow userspace to set the IsSM port capability bit,
and a bunch of mthca driver improvements.  There shouldn't be anything
risky (and it's all confined to drivers/infiniband).
Thanks,
  Roland
