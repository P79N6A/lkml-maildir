Hello,
I've compiled a new kernel using the ck5 patchset you made, but have had
some problems. It seems that with my configuration, I expose a memory
leak somewhere. After the system has been up for a while, or if I try to
compile anything non-trivial (kde-libs for example), The system will use
up all available memory and further memory alloc's fail. Swap is hardly
being used in this case. My syslog file does report:
Apr 10 19:06:19 waltsathlon kernel: __alloc_pages: 1-order allocation
failed (gfp=0x1f0/0)
Apr 10 19:06:19 waltsathlon kernel: __alloc_pages: 0-order allocation
failed (gfp=0xf0/0)
Apr 10 19:06:19 waltsathlon kernel: __alloc_pages: 1-order allocation
failed (gfp=0x1f0/0)
Typically, apps fail although the OOM killer isn't triggered (not sure
if it's enabled in ck5).
I'm wondering if there's a strange interaction with XFS? I also use the
Nvidia driver, however, I also tested without loading it and receive the
same results. My XFS thought is due to the strange behaviour of the
filesystem with this patchset. When I tried compiling kdelibs, the
system chugged along until memory was used (15-20 mins) and then the
compile could no longer proceed. After seeing this and issuing a 'sync',
the drives thrashed for approx. 30-45 seconds as if flushing unwritten
data. It's as if writes are being stored indefinitely? Reverting back to
ck4 and all is well. System info below:
Chaintech 7KDD 760MPX MB
2 x AMD 2400MP
1 GB ECC Ram
2-2 disk striped arrays - 1 software MD, 1 Promise Fasttrak
XFS filesystem on all mount points except boot
Compiled with GCC-3.2.2
glibc-2.3.1
