Just to throw my own observations into the war, I have to agree with David
K. here.  This needs to be some sort of module and/or interface.  Get the
policy into a replaceable user space module.
One of the hot areas for the kernel right now is for embedded systems.
They need an entirely different strategy than for a desk top.  I'm working
on such a thing now were we don't even have an enabled swap space and the
OOM is causing us no end of trouble as we start dipping below 1MB "free"
system memory.
