You can't be serious. It's a callback function we're discussing here,
and you even quoted it.

There are cases when it is. It happens when a line discipline does it.
The n_tty does it if the line is in cooked mode, which is the default.
n_hdlc does it always, though I have no idea if this is applicable
to airprime. I think PPP writes from a tasklet as well.
The idea to allocate a URB for every little user write bothers me as
well. It was a dirty code thrown together quickly by someone who could
not be bothered to use a circular buffer and two URBs. It was fine
for the visor.c, but the Airprime is a higher performance card, and it
can be used in a home gateway with a low-power CPU. I'm not happy.
