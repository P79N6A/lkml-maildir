Subject: [PATCH]: powerpc: pseries: Print PCI slot location code on failure
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/6/15/215

Resending an older patch (from 28 April) that seems to have fallen
through the cracks, its not in mailine, is not in -mm and its not
controversial (its mostly a printk change). Tested.
--linas
The PCI error recovery code will printk diagnostic info when
a PCI error event occurs. Change the messages to include the slot
location code, which is how most sysadmins will know the device.
