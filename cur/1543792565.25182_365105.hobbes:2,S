[Summary of previous post: 'advansys' driver started working on PowerMac 
8500/G3 with 2.6.14 but ZD1201 wireless USB dongle seems to hang.]

I'm now skeptical that the problem is specific to the PowerMac 8500/G3,
as i've seen the ZD1201 wireless driver hang more than once after a similar
amount of elapsed time on a Sony VAIO R505 laptop.  So it might not be a 
PPC issue, Ben.
I'm now involving in trying to regress this thing, to see what might
have made the Advansys driver start working and when the ZD1201 driver
started hanging.  (I might find out about the MESH complaints in the
process.)  I think i've seen the 2.6.13 ZD1201 driver hang on the G3 and
still need to see if that also happens on my i386 laptop.  It can take
hours for this to happen, so chasing this down may take awhile.
