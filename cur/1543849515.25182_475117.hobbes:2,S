I doubt it.
I don't know how many machines will be affected by this, but I'd expect
it's quite a few - the Vaio has a less-than-one-year-old Intel CPU in it.
I'd expect that if a distro were to enable NO_HZ, they'd have a large
number of unhappy users whose machines run like crap, some of whom would
find out that they need to add some funny dont-run-like-crap option and
some of whom would, after wasting considerable amounts of time, just give
up and use windows or RH5.2 or something.
IOW, it would be vastly better to make it simply work out-of-the-box.
