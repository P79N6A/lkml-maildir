  And not only distributable computing. Ioctl lacks enforced interface
  and a model to back up this interface up. Ioctl is slow (a syscall
  for each ioctl is required). Ioctl is not safe (even with
  {device,tag,type,size} semantics for request). And finally, ioctl's
  are not portable.
  I'm not saying they should banned right away, but that they should be
  considered for replacement in the near future with something like
  plan9 ctl files or /dev/sg type of thing.

  I thought mosix does not have ioctl problem, since they don't move
  the processes, but allocate them in close proximity (for an ioctl)
  to the resources.
