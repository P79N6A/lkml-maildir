wait_for_CD_insertion() can't sleep though.  It would have to busy loop polling
the CDROM_DRIVE_STATUS ioctl (windoze does essentially this).

Sure you can lock the drive shut and use the CDROM_SEND_PACKET ioctl to slam
out a INQUIRY packet, and if it reports that it supports Mt. Fuji, then you can
shoot out a GET_CONFIGURATION packet and read the results to see if 1) medium
can be locked 2) and supports Morphing.  If all is well so far, then you can
send out a GET_EVENT/STATUS_NOTIFICATION packet and check the result to see if
the external request notification class is supported.  If it is, then you can
do completely host controlled CDROM drive control (of course since no drives
supports asyncronous host event notification ("Asyncronous Morphing"), you will
need to poll the drive to see any media events.
And then there is the little problem at Mt. Fuji support
is not especially wide-spread at the moment...
