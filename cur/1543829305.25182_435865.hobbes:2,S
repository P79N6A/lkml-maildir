Yes, it will fetch the things into your database, unlike BK, but that's 
kind of the point. That's what makes branches so powerful (you can do a 
lot more than "bk changes -R").

Hmm? Again, do
	git fetch <thing-to-be-fetched>
into a local branch first. That gets it into your repo, so that you can do 
things.
After that, I'm not quite sure what you mean by "--dry-run". Do you mean 
to know about file-level conflicts? You do need to do the merge in order 
to know whether the conflicts can be resolved, but even without doing the 
merge you can look for _file_level_ conflicts by other means.
I don't think anybody has done it, but a script like
	OTHER="$1"
	BASE=$(git-merge-base HEAD $OTHER) || exit
	git-merge-tree $BASE HEAD $OTHER | grep -v '^0'
will show if there were file-level conflicts (in a pretty strange format, 
admittedly).
Of course, 99% of the time, a three-way merge will just handle those fine 
(the output from "git-merge-tree" is enough to know to do a three-way 
merge on temp-files, if you want to try that).
