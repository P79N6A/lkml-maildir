	While certainly not an exhaustive list, DB people love their
reads and writes, but are pining for network reads and writes.  They
also are very excited about async poll(), connect(), and accept().  One
of the big problems today is that you can either sleep for your I/O in
io_getevents() or for your connect()/accept() in poll()/epoll(), but
there is nowhere you can sleep for all of them at once.  That's why the
aio list continually proposes aio_poll() or returning aio events
via epoll().
	Fibril based syscalls would allow async connect()/accept() and
the rest of networking, plus one stop shopping for completions.
