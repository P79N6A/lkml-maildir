At least it is not worse (I hope ...) ;-)

Does it start messing right after you enable it, or only after you write 
to it (starting X...) ?

Apart from this kinda usual write-on-reserved-bits in the AGP 
initialization, which has been done before on various chipsets and 
almost never caused any trouble, I saw no blatant errors that may lead 
to such things... In fact, we have several PCs with i815 chipsets in the 
lab. People are using AGP without any troubles. The only difference is 
that we run an old kernel version (2.4.3-13, thanks the sysadmin for 
never upgrading....), and we have a different graphic card (Matrox).
Alan, do you have any idea about this one ?
Best regards
