Changing the header format doesn't make *ANY* difference whatsoever.
You have to write two copies of the swap header, and the kernel should 
check for a header at MIN_PAGE_SIZE first and then at PAGE_SIZE.
If there are fields (other than position) in the v2 swap header that are 
dependent on PAGE_SIZE, then the copy at MIN_PAGE_SIZE should be sized 
using MIN_PAGE_SIZE, and the copy at PAGE_SIZE should be sized at 
PAGE_SIZE.  It's that simple.
Creating a new format will not help that one iota, and will create 
gratuitous incompatiblity for the very common case of PAGE_SIZE == 
MIN_PAGE_SIZE.
