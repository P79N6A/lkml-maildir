As Alan said, this only makes the interfaces more cumbersome, slower, harder
to maintain and extend. You have to constantly think about being backward
compatible - just as Windows 9x is backward compatible with DOS 2.0
software, which kills 70% of its would-be potential.

XF86 is a user-level program which has no idea of many issues kernel has to
worry about - I mean low-level stuff, like SMP, fs access etc. XF86 has
high-level, user-level interfaces which are much easier to deal with than
the low-level driver stuff.

Yes, it worked - but the price for any serious user of their OS was way to
high - they traded stability for backward compatibility.

But what you describe *is* binary driver model compatibility! Being based on
old, horribly designed DOS overlay, Win9x is itself just a more capable
overlay with all the problems stemming from the *binary* (as the source
compatibility really doesn;t matter with Windows) compatibility.

Win32 itself is changing a lot and there are cases when binary Win95 drivers
won't work with the later 9x versions. WinNT is more stable than Win9x,
because it has almost *no* binary compatibility with previous versions on
the driver and lower levels.

Hmm... Take a look at any driver floppy coming with WinNT supported software
- you have separate drivers for WinNT 3.x and WinNT 4+ - why? Because the
driver model has changed. This is *not* binary compatibility. And why so
much hardware doesn't work with NT? Because there are *no* older and
compatible drivers that work with NT 4.

And you have to admint OS/2 is much slower? I'd attribute that to too many
layers which exist to provide the binary compatibility.

Somehow Linux survived several long years without what you propose, and is
still really well - more, it's getting better. With source code availability
you, as the concerned vendor, can setup a dedicated compilation server with
your drivers precompiled for the most common and the latest Linux kernels
and provide your users with a service to download, upgrade and install your
drivers without hassle. If there's no version of your drivers for their
particular platform - just ask them several simple questions (architecture,
compiler used to compile their kernel etc.) in a nice web-based form and
after several seconds give them a ready binary package. This *ALL* can be
nicely done in the user space without messing with the kernel.

What's the problem? You always KNOW what version the kernel was compiled
with. The only information missing would be what optimizations were used to
compile the kernel, but its rather easy to embed this info in the kernel if
need arises.

As said above, you *CAN* do the same without modifying the kernel.

Binary compatibility != stability. Binary compatibility == problems, and it
was chosen by MS because of their closed-source model. In OpenSource it is
not necessary - it can be done in other ways, more clean, nicer and elegant.

You're giving examples from a completely different fairy tail. XF86 has a
much easier case to deal with.
