The thing is, I don't see why we should be building castles and cathedrals
around printk.  Just cast to the wider value, if you get it wrong you have
lost exactly what?  Are people feeding the output of dmesg into scripts
that their systems depend upon?  If so, we need to let evolution do its
work.
If this had something to do with how the kernel worked, it might be worth
inventing a new feature.
