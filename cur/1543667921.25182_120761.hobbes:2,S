Besides the problems with mode switching with fbcon, I have two other
problems with sisfb:
1. My gpm mouse cursor on the framebuffer console is a cyan rectangle
with a bright orange "G" in it.  Actually the G has a "^" accent over
it.  That's just when it's over a blank spot.  When I move it over other
characters, the character in the pointer changes.  However, it does work
for selecting text.
2. I can't seem to set the default video mode from the kernel command
line.  I have tried:
video=sis:1024x768-24@75
video=sisfb:1024x768-24@75
and neither one works.  What is the expected command line?
Thanks,
