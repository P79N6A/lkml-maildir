Well, yes, the CVS version I mentioned in my patch is needed as I found a bug in 
the expression analizer.  I am NOT trying to say compatable with old tools.  I 
AM trying to do something the CURRENT tools make hard to impossible.
The problem with the gas CFI support is that it does not provide a way to define 
CFI expressions which are needed to determine if the CFI address should be zero 
(i.e. the return is to user space) or the current adjusted stack address.
I suppose the open ended .cfi_ thing could be used but it requires that you 
compute your own sleb128 and uleb128 values.  It is also not clear how you tell 
this thing if you want a word or a half word as the dwarf2 spec requires.  More 
info on this would be very "nice".  I really would like to do this with out the 
dwarf2 macros, but, please understand, one of the main reasons for the effort 
was to tie off the bottom of the stack and that seems to require an expression 
capability for the asm code in entry.S.
