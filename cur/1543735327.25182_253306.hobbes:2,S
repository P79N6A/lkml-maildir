I have a few qmail (about the heaviest fsync using mta software around) 
boxes that have their queues on ext3.
On a 2.6.7 kernel, these guys are guaranteed to crash within hours if I 
used data=journal for the fs on which the qmail queues are. I say this 
because I ran two of them with data=journal mode and they crashed once 
or more a day. Another one which stayed with ordered had no problems 
during the same period.
Going back to ordered meant that they ran stable for days (weeks now).
The only thing I could get from the logs is:
