Don't you think I don't know how to handle SCSI devices, do you? We have a
whole lot of them here and I DO know what the termination, term power etc.
stand for :))  And yes, I have seen what a proper SCSI cabling looks like...
Moreover, the same CD-ROM does work fine when I plug the cable off the GDT
and insert the very same end of the very same cable connected to the very
same devices into the narrow SCSI socket of a separate controller....
Also I did hear somewhere that the thing called parity checking does exist
for a SCSI bus... GDT monitor (native Linux, realtime :)) does not detect
any errors :-((
It's not a card/motherboard compatibility problem either - Windoze NT DOES
install outta the CD-ROM on the same machine (this is the machine supplier's
way to persuade us the hardware is OK)...
