I do it a bit faster (i.e. without "od"): if after a Compose operation, I see 
something, it must have been UTF8. If not (like there has been only 8 bits 
output), the current line screws up a little. <- My test strategy; does not 
need `od` to confirm.

ö is a "native key" on my keyboard, i.e. i do not need to play with compose to 
generate ö.

I did that (a shortened form of yours), and saw by `dumpkeys` that there was 
now only one compose table entry, so I think `loadkeys --unicode` overwrites 
the table? Rightly so.
Still and despite there are now no compose table entries, with the exception of 
that one, I can still generate ö. <compose><"><o> rightly gives two 7-bit 
characters (rightly so at this point).
>Good. I hope more people raise their hands for this.
...want kanji-on-console, but I guess that will not come true with VGA, which 
only supports 256 (512) chars. OTOH, [free]BSD's mouse support uses a graphical 
mouse pointer rather than a "block" one like gpm does, and as I think of it, 
such a graphical mouse (most Norton apps for DOS also had such) needs some VGA 
magic or so to set single "pixels"/bits. If single bits within the 8x{16,etc.} 
char cell can be set, we could have kanji.
Can anyone elaborate on this graphical mouse stuff?
