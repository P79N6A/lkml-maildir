Any card at all that has specs available, would be easy to
program, either directly with port writes, or by writing a simple
driver for.  If specs are not available though, running it in
DOSemu or with a breakout box of some kind should yield very
simple to decode (reverse engineer) hardware.  Any DTMF card
AFAICS is a fairly simple device.  I can't imagine it using any
more than a few ports that are easy to determine, especially with
DOSEMU.
Please let me know what you find out about this, including
hardware, specs, and software.
Thanks, and good luck!
