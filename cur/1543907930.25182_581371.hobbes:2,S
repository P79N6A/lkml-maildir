Problem is, things like UIO provide a real solution for a wide range of
different types of devices.  Like the one provided in the kernel right
now, and a bunch of others that I am currently discussing with different
manufacturers (think high-speed DSPs that just want to give userspace
direct access to the card and have the kernel get the hell out of the
way so data can be read and processed as fast as possible.)
And also realize that some types of systems have been doing this very
same kind of kernel/userspace interface for many years, namely X :)
As for the legalities of using closed source userspace code with the UIO
interface, consult a lawyer if you have questions, and be sure to bring
up Alan's comments about derivative works :)
thanks,
