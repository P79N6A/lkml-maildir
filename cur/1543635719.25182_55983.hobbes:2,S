Hello,
I have a linux fileserver that wraps around the 'RX bytes' and 'TX bytes'
counters once every couple of days.  Since these variables are "unsigned
long" in the kernel (32 bits on x86) it wraps at four gigabytes.  I
patched a kernel (2.4.19-pre10-ac2) to make these two variables, along
with RX and TX packet counters, "unsigned long long"  which is 64 bits on
x86.
This seems to work OK.  The "ifconfig" command (from RedHat net-tools-1.60
RPM) already defines these values as "unsigned long long", so I don't have
any problems with ifconfig reporting weird numbers.
I did notice that different classes of network devices seem to use
different structs, so I guess this would only work for ethernet devices.
This is the first hacking of any kind I've done on the kernel.  Any
comments would be appreciated.
The patch I used:
