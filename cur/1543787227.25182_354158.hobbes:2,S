Subject: [PATCH mm] linear pte_file fix

My recent mm patch to give pte_ERROR in do_file_page unless VM_NONLINEAR
was incorrect.  I was forgetting Oleg's patch to the populate functions,
which forces install_file_pte when MAP_POPULATE + MAP_NONBLOCK but page
not in cache (in case an existing nonlinear entry needs removing).  But
that's only necessary in the VM_NONLINEAR case: let's keep the strict
check in do_file_page, and adjust filemap_populate and shmem_populate.
