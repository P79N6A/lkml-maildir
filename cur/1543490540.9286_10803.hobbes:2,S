	The problem is getting pppd to work with kernel 2.2.3 on a
Red Hat version 5.2 computer. The pppd version is the latest done
March 11 1999. All works fine under the 2.0.36 kernel. 
	Below is a debug from pppd and it shows that pppd is not
getting through to the ISP. The dev/modem is sim linked to dev/ttyS0
as required. 
	All other functions appear to work fine. I applied all kernel
2.2.x rpm files to my system.
Hi Michael, well did it and still no joy. I checked the hard way and made
sure ip_no_pmtu_disc has exactly 1 in it. But when I called my ISP the
exchange was odd and here it is:

	Any help would be most welcome. The new kernel has beat me!
