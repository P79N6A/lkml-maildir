Subject: 2.5.5-pre1 -- Two weird problems:  my kernel log is incomplete and a usermode client problem

Problem #1
I have applied a host of patches in order to get a bootable
kernel with usable drivers.  Unfortunately, my kernel log
is corrupted.  Also, dmesg output is faulty.  During the boot
process, I appear to see all the correct information flash by.
As you can see from the included log snippet, there are a 
few errors that probably indicate a cause.  Specifically,
the line "Error seeking in /dev/kmem"looks bad.

Problem #2
I run Evolution (Ximian's E-Mail, Calendar, etc. client).  
I find that when I run Evolution under 2.5.5-pre1, whenever I
try to access the Contacts list, the client locks up.  I have
run it under gdb, but see no crash.  If I break into the 
debugger, I see nothing suspicious.  Thinking about this some
more, I am wondering if this could be due to the fact that
I use ipchains when I boot my 2.4 kernel.  Since the 2.5 kernel
doesn't have ipchains support, ipchains doesn't start up.
Could this have something to do with it?  I really don't
know how to proceed with debugging this problem.
Thanks,
	Miles
