Subject: Call for evaluation: new Intel eepro/100+, eepro100/S open source driver (but not GPL).  Is it stable, neat, or on it's way into the kernel?

Fellow Linux friends and aficionados,
Intel released a new driver for their Intel Ether Express 100/+ and 100/S
line of cards.  I'm quite proud of our own ieepro100 driver, and it's a
1.0.0 version so I wont volunteer myself as a guinea pig, but it would be
great to here what other people think about it (Linus, AC?).  It probably
wont because the license isn't fully GPL (heck, I don't even know how close
it is).
At the least, maybe we could pilfer some code (like the Adapter teaming and
fault tolerance options) and install it into our driver.
