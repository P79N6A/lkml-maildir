I've been thinking it would be useful for kernel debugging if kernel
oops messages could use the branch history to show the last few jumps on
processors which support it.  It would help a lot with the "oh, an oops
with eip==esp==0" type crashes, which are otherwise pretty unhelpful.
Do you think that would be easy/possible to support?  Would it interfere
with other uses of these features?
