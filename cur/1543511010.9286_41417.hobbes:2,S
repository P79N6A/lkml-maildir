Subject: Why no printk for duplicate IPs?

I was wondering today why linux would not put a message in syslog when
someone steals my IP, so I grepped the sources, but all I found was:
linux/net/ipv6/addrconf.c:       printk(KERN_INFO "%s: duplicate address detected!\n", ifp->idev->dev->name);
So, is it  correct that for IPv4,  linux won't report the  fact that another
machine is answering ARP requests for one of its IPs?
If so why?
Thanks,
Marc
