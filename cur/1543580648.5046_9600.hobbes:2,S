XFS does something called a "forced shutdown" of the filesystem in which
it requires outstanding I/Os issued against file data to be cancelled. 
This is triggered by (among other things) errors in writing out file

Of course, I was thinking along the lines of an API flushing the requests
out of the elevator at that time .... didn't get too far with it though.
