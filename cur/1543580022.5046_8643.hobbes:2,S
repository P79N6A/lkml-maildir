They chose their vendor. 
In the case of Cisco, they aparently chose OK as cisco fixed their product
right away.
In the case of Raptor they made a bad decision as the vendor still has not
fixed the problem...
They could have chose Linux where if there had been an issue they could have
gotten it fixed without respect to the vendors idea of how important the
problem is...
