From a user's standpoint, no of course not. But once it's included in the
mainline it's forced upon the kernel maintainers and if parts of it are
used to extend the VFS it's forced upon even more of the kernel
maintainers.
And when have I ever accused Hans of anything?

Yes, they are the issues. But I believe most of the big problems have been
fixed (i.e. things like R4 containing it's own hashing library instead of
using what's already in the kernel) in the original thread. And from what I
remember of the R3 saga back right after the 2.4.0 release, this looks
extremely familiar so I really doubt Hans will be changing any time soon.
And I agree that -mm is too unstable for R4 to get serious testing there,
the few times I gave it a try I always had more than one problem that
forced me back to -linus with a few custom patches.

I think you're putting too much of an idealogical spin on the history of
Linux. And I seem to remember a lot of people claiming that R3 was the
filesystem of the future back around it's release as well and as far as I
can tell there's only a few major distributions that support R3 at all. 
If R4 isn't included it won't kill anything and if anything these
discussions have already gotten people thinking about new things that can
be done at the VFS level, so I wouldn't be surprised if we see VFS plugins
to handle things like on the fly compression whether R4 is included or not.

I still believe that "fast and cool" alone isn't enough. If someone were to
offer to sell you car that looked extremely cool and was outrageously fast
to the tune of like 2000hp would you buy it without thinking or would you 
want to make sure it had other important features like anti-lock breaks, 
airbags and someone who understands the engine enough to fix it when
something gets broke?
