Larger x86 boxes. I can't seem to find PDA's with Solaris or phones
with Solaris or $70 wireless routers with Solaris.

ptrace. Actually there are folks who want to take ptrace a bit further

recast into ptrace extensions look good.

Why do that, why not use the existing functionality that the kernel
provides built on the stuff Intel AMD and friends stuck in the CPU. I'm
not claiming our debugging tools are as good as dtrace but most of it
(especially with kprobes patches installed) is essentially a UI design
issue.
