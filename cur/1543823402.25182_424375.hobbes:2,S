Hmmm... I tried to fix this problem in the following commit.  With it,
ATA_DFLAG_PIO isn't cleared over ata_dev_configure().  Only
ata_dev_set_mode() is allowed to diddle with it and does about the same
thing as your patch does.

    [PATCH] libata: clear only affected flags during ata_dev_configure()
    ata_dev_configure() should not clear dynamic device flags determined
    elsewhere.  Lower eight bits are reserved for feature flags, define
    ATA_DFLAG_CFG_MASK and clear only those bits before configuring
    device.  Without this patch, ATA_DFLAG_PIO gets turned off during
    revalidation making PIO mode unuseable.

Is this agreed upon?  I tend to omit almost all unnecessary (by operator
precedence) parenthesis, so in new EH and all other stuff, the "a && b &
c" sort of lines are abundant.  If this is something that's agreed upon,
I can do a clean sweep over those.
