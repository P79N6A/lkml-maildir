Subject: [patch 0/12] several fixes from randconfig compiles

This is a series of minor fixes for problems observed while
doing some randconfig fun on x86_64.
Some problems might have been reported on LKML before. But AFAIK they
are not fixed in current git. Thus I report them again - including
possible fixes.
Regards,
Andreas
