Arjan,
The probes are inserted at physical page level and if the
executable is mmaped private, probes never gets written to the disk.
The physical page mmaped will still have probes in it. If the page in
the memory gets discarded due to the low-memory situation, then probes
will get inserted into that page when read in via readpage/s() hooks.
Only thing that will be written to the disk is the corresponding
inode, since we increment and decrement its i_writecount.
But, if we do a objdump on the probed executable, we are seeing the
breakpoints in the disassembly. We are looking into this issue.
Does this mean that breakpoints are written to the disk?
If the executable is mmaped shared, then those mappings will get written
back to the disk.
Writting to the disk is not the requirement for user-space probes, it is
just the side effect and probes are successful even if it is written or
not to the disk.
User-space probes are successful even if it is on "read-only" mounts, since
nothing is written back.
