Subject: why no Kconfig in "kernel" subdir?

I was adding a new general syscall the other day, and it struck me as 
odd that there is no Kconfig in the "kernel" subdirectory.
A quick search shows 36 separate config options being used in that 
subdirectory (stuff like PREEMPT, SMP, FUTEX, HOTPLUG, SYSCTL, etc). 
Why is there no Kconfig for it?  As it stands, all of these have to be 
copied and pasted in every single arch.  This seems odd.
Would people be open to a series of patches that create a new Kconfig 
and start moving generic stuff to it?  Or are these things really 
arch-specific enough to warrent massive duplication?
Chris
