Christoph, /proc/slabinfo is an _ABI_. You HAVE to provide it. slabtop 
relies on it, people use it every day to monitor memory consumption.
I'm really getting worried that you are apparently incapable of grasping 
such _SIMPLE_ concepts. Who the heck cares whether you put in zeros or 
whatever else in some of the fields? People use it to know how many 
objects are allocated and sure SLUB knows that count, sheesh. How on 
earth can you come up with a lame excuse like that? You dont like the 
'SLAB' portion of the name perhaps? Is it NIH again?
Really, if your behavior is representative of how our SLAB allocator 
will be maintained in the future then i'm very, very worried :-( You 
ignore and downplay clear-cut regressions, you insult and attack 
testers, you are incredibly stupid about user ABIs (or pretend to be so) 
and you distort and mislead all the way. What will you be able to do in 
the much less clear-cut cases??
