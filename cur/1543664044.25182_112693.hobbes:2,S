Were we able to release memory w/o rmap: yes.
Can we do it again: yes.
Can we use a bit of the released memory to release further memory more
efficiently with rmap: yes.
I'm not saying it's easy to implement that, but the problem that we'll
need memory to release memory doesn't exit, since it also never existed
before rmap was introduced into the kernel. Sure, the early stage of the
swapping would be more cpu-intensive, but that is the feature.
