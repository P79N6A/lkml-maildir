No need to duplicate effort.

I'd love to be able to work on this driver, but unfortunately it seem
IBM did not put any accelerometers in the X31, which is what I have

I keep getting 0x01 and 0x80 from the first latch check instead of 0x0.
So unless someone wants to sponsor me an X41... ;)

Yes, good to hear.
