Thanks for the advise, I'm running this command right now.
Does this need to be run every time I pull changes into the
tree or is it enough that I run it once ?
Now, with any vendor locking arguments out of the way the
various source control systems should be able to compete on
a level ground.  If you (for random values of 'you') want
to put the Linux kernel source in another source control
system and/or you develop another source control system, you
won't need bitkeeper in order to do so ...
I won't be holding my breath for a better tool than bitkeeper,
though ... it'll probably be quite a while for the other source
control tools to come close to the functionality I'm using on
a daily basis ;)
regards,
Rik
