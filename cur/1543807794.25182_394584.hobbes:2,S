This is talking not about the text above but about what comes later right? 
The OOM behavior for a constrained allocation with no swap?

Memory policies are rare and this would be insignificant on any NUMA 
system.

An upper bit in policy would require special processing in hot code paths. 
The current implementation can simply OR in a value that is in a cacheline 
already in the data cache.
I'd rather keep it separate.
Function arguments? Add function pointer to mempolicy for allocation?
Then there is the other issue:
Should the system swap if an MPOL_BIND request does not find enough 
memory? Maybe it would be good to not swap, rely on zone_reclaim only and 
fail if there is no local memory? 
We could change __GFP_NO_OOM_KILLER to __GFP_CONSTRAINED_ALLOC and then 
not invoke kswapd and neither the OOM killer on a constrained allocation.
