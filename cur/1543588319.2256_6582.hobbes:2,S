Don't know. I think the  CONFIG_ARCH_CLPS7110 is a stub refering to
mine and Werner's (2.2) PDA port, which AFAIK hasn't been mergerd.
I think CONFIG_ARCH_CLPS711X is a completely seperate port done
by a different group to the evaluaiton boards and similiar.
I'm not sure but that's certianly what it looks like to me, I
was hoping Russell might have said something more useful.

     Think of the mess on the carpet. Sensible people do all their
     demon-summoning in the garage, which you can just hose down afterwards.
