<nitpick>Yes and no. There are no UTF-8 or UCS-4 characters. These are encodings
for Unicode characters. </nitpick>

The standard say a decode should not accept invalid UTF-8 characters. Not
decoding them and just pass the garbage on is one way of not "accepting" them; i.e.
"i'm not decoding this trash". In UTF-8 seen as a byte stream this is trivial. Those that 
recode to a 16-bit encoding like QT (recode them to invalid UTF-16 so it can be encoded
back to the original invalid UTF-8). That's at least what the kopete people told me. (Haven't
read the code yet). With UCS-4 or UCS-2 the decoder must reject the data or make a very
good decision. Normalizing is a very bad one, since, as we know, an invalid UTF-8 sequence
simply does not represent a unicode character.

And then (above) there is no normalized UTF-8. There are strings of valid characters
and invalid characters. Any app that tries to make sense of any garbage is a security
risk. This apples not only to UTF-8. but function like atof that decodes anything
to a double at best NaN).
