There is a much bigger question here, which is "are modules first class
citizens"?  Doing it properly turns us into a poor-man's microkernel.
We would standardize our registration interfaces (similar to the standard
notifier.h), and have them all do the inc and decs.
OTOH, if you treat module removal as a CONFIG_DEBUG_KERNEL thing, life
becomes much much simpler.
I have the code, I'll be serious about it in ~2 months.
Rusty.
