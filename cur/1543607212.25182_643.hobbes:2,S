Any VM with paging _can_ be forced into a trashing situation where
a keypress takes hours to process.  A better VM will take more pressure
before it gets there and performance will degrade more gradually.
But any VM can get into this situation.
Consider a malicious app that uses lots of RAM but deliberately leaves
a _single_ page free.  OOM will never happen, but the machine is
brought to its knees anyway.  (You can also get in trouble by running
a few hundred infinite loops, with some dummy io so they too get the
io boost other processes gets.)
Swapping out whole processes can help this, but it will merely
move the point where you get stuck.  A load control system that
kills processes when response is too slow is possible, but
the problem here is that you can't get people to agree
on how bad is too bad.  It is sometimes ok to leave the machine 
alone crunching a big problem over the weekend.  And sometimes
you _need_ response much faster.
And what app to kill in such a situation?
You had a single memory pig, but it aint necessarily so.
