I dont think Ingo is looking for perfection. Its about a different 
optimization goals.
Let me put it this way:
checkpatch in advanced mode:
- I want to be able to see as many possible problems (this is the optimization 
goal)
- I accept that I get false positives
- not useful for git and mail traffic
checkpatch in safe mode:
- I never want a false positive (different optimization goal!)
- I accept that I will miss several real bugs because several tricky tests are 
disabled
- useful for git and mail traffic
