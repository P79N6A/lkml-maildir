Erm, what should it do then? Fail the AGP map ?

I know that, but it seems rather racy expensive and complicated.

change_page_attr is more than just cachability. You can use it e.g.
to write protect kernel pages not (if you wanted to do that for some
reason) 
The current one is fine with PAGE_KERNEL_NOCACHE, you could eventually
define PAGE_KERNEL_WRITECOMBINING too if you wanted.

Exposing it to user space in a more general way is tricky because
you need to avoid aliases with different caching attributes and also
change the kernel map as needed (would be surely an interesting 
project, but definitely requires more work) 
You can already use WT. DRM does that already in fact. 
Newer Intel/AMD CPUs allow to set up a more general PAT table with some
more modis, but to be honest I don't see the point in most of them,
except perhaps WC. Unfortunately there is no 'weak ordering like alpha/sparc64'
mode that could be used in the kernel :-)
