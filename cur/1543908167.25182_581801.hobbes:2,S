What do you use for testing? I set up ata over ethernet... swapping
over that should deadlock w/o your patches.
But I'm able to compile kernel (-j 10) on 128MB machine, and I tried
cat /dev/zero | grep foo to exhaust memory... and could not reproduce
the deadlock. Should I pingflood? Tweak down ammount of atomic memory
avaialable to make deadlocks easier to reproduce?
