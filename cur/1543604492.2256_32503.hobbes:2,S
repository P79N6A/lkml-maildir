Subject: IDE Hot-Swap, does it work?

Is IDE Hot-Swap supported in any fashion in
linux?  If so what are the recommended controllers
and enclosures to use?  Are there any standards
for IDE enclosures like there are for SCSI (SAF-TE
SES)?  
In addition, I have noticed that there is an
hdparm command that will allow me to rescan
an interface, but I cannot get it to do anything
other than lock my machine up with the promise
card I have.  Anyone have insight into this?
Thanks,
Mike
