Subject: [PATCH mm] fix swapoff breakage; however...

rc4-mm1's memory-controller-memory-accounting-v7.patch broke swapoff:
it extended unuse_pte_range's boolean "found" return code to allow an
error return too; but ended up returning found (1) as an error.
Replace that by success (0) before it gets to the upper level.

More fundamentally, it looks like any container brought over its limit in
unuse_pte will abort swapoff: that doesn't doesn't seem "contained" to me.
Maybe unuse_pte should just let containers go over their limits without
error?  Or swap should be counted along with RSS?  Needs reconsideration.
