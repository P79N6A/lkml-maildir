You've ignored the "driver specific factors" and one of the drivers
already has such a thing (borgi_bl's low battery backlight limiting).
My driver_brightness is really a more generic version of your "hw_power"
which allows other factors to be taken into consideration as well. We
may as well have the broader-range solution as it costs us nothing.
(I don't expect each factor to be visible to userspace, just the end
result).
