No, it doesn't... this has been covered several times already.  It
requires ls to *lstat* the point; it only does a stat() if the resulting
entry is S_IFLNK.  The same is true for GUI tools.  There is a fairly
easy way to distinguish lstat() from virtually all other filesystem
calls -- it doesn't invoke follow_link.  So the answer is simply to
create an inode which is S_IFDIR but has a follow_link method.  The
follow_link method triggers a mount.  This is called a "pseudo-symlink
directory" or sometimes "ghost directory".
