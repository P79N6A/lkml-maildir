In short: mmap on /proc/XXX/mem is bloody huge overkill. With
ill-specified semantics. If all you need is an alias on private data that
belongs to the same process - fine, but then it should be done in a
different way. If you want file-backed stuff - better yet, just mmap() it
twice. But mmap() on /proc/<pid>/mem was simply broken. It gave a
way to screw swapper. Badly.
