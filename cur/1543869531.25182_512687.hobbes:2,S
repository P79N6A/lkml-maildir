Neither of them seem to have acked patches in drivers/parport for some
time either, much less signed off on them.  And that webpage lists the
latest patches (from Tim) ... for 2.5.6-pre2!!  For the moment I've got
the appended patch in my set of parport patches.  Unless one of the
folk listed as maintainers (cc'd) squawks appropriately, I'll send this
along with the next batch of patches.

The writing on the wall seem to be that the parport stack is orphaned,
rather than maintained...
