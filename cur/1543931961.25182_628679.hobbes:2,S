looks good to me. Could you please also provide three more controls that 
i suggested earlier:
 - a boot option enabling/disabling the udelay based code
 - a .config method of enabling/disabling the udelay based code
 - a sysctl to toggle it
if we want to clean this all up we'll need as many controls as possible.
