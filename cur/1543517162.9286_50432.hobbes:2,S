This has bugged me for a while (A long while).
I have a machine that's using nfsroot.  When I login at the console, or via
a program that uses /dev/ttyp* then 'w' shows that I'm always idle.  Appears
as if the devices aren't being updated.  Is there a reason for this?  (I'm
not concerned about bandwidth, this machine is on 100mbit along with the nfs
server)
