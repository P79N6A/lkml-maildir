But if we had 32-pid pids, the box would have to be up for a very
long time before it wrapped the pid counter, hence O(1) work with
less overhead than the random option.
A random pid generator can hit inuse pids forever, so, unless you
are expensively careful, pid generation can be non-terminating.
Personally, I'd like to see them as an option anyway.
Matthew.
