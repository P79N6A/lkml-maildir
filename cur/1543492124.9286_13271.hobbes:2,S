There is nothing wrong with the drive or mainboard.
PIIX3 can,t do UDMA.
There is no currect code to back peddle to correct gross hardware
problem.  It can be done by recompiling with CONFIG_AUTODMA disabled,
and call from your rc.local script.
hdparm -X34 -d1 /dev/hda
Only after booting.

It can't............do it. this the disable.
