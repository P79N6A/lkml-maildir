Hi people,
Earlier today I mailed that I had a mouse going sluggish and crazy under 
kernel 2.6.2 rc2.
The problem was just that my harddisk wasn't working in DMA mode.
For people that have mice going crazy, I solved my problem like this:
hdparm /dev/xxxx (e.g. hdparm /dev/hda)
There should be something like
/dev/hda:
 multcount    = 16 (on)
 IO_support   =  1 (32-bit)
 unmaskirq    =  1 (on)
 using_dma    =  1 (on)
 keepsettings =  0 (off)
 readonly     =  0 (off)
 readahead    = 256 (on)
 geometry     = 65535/16/63, sectors = 156301488, start = 0
If using_dma is off, than that might explain why your mouse is so 
sluggish. Try hdparm -d1 /dev/xxx (this should put dma on).
If you get an error message, check whether you compiled your kernel with 
the needed support for your motherboard chipset for DMA. If not so, 
build the module that corresponds with your chipset, modprobe that 
module and try again.
After this, mouse problems should be over...
Grtz
Robert
