Trimmed linux-pci so as not to annoy those who don't want to listen to
all of this. Anyone else who wants off the CC list should yell also. :-)

It wasn't meant to be a trick. In fact, I _want_ the compiler to cache
the myvar value in the second case -- I was merely wondering if there
was some fact that I overlooked that would prevent such an optimization.
The ultimate point of this was to show that globals can actually be
slower than locals (imagine the int in the example replaced by a
gigantic struct), contrary to the implication of your original
statement. :-)
