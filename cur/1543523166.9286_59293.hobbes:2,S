Subject: [PATCH] kswapd less agressive
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi Alan, Andrea,
a few people (hi Andrea :)) have commented that kswapd
is somewhat too agressive in 2.2.15pre4. This patch
should fix that (but don't integrate it yet, I have not
tested it yet).
Basically kswapd used to agressively free pages until
it had reached freepages.high. Now kswapd will only
free pages agressively up to freepages.low, above that
it will pause if it finds it's ->need_resched set.
(which should bring us back to freeing in the background)
Everyone interested: please test 2.2.15pre4 with and
without this test and tell us your results, thank you.
regards,
Rik
