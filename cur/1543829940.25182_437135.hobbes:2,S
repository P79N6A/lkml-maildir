Indeed. That was so useful in fact that I added the same to the Fedora
kernel quite some time back.  Having a build fail in the first few minutes
is much preferable to having it fail after 15 minutes.
I've not encountered any breakage due to that for some time though.
Though perhaps Andrew had config options enabled that we disabled in
our builds.
