Seems like I didn't get your point. What is broken on x86 other than high 
UIDs?

In which way are the BSD accounting tools broken? I'm unfamiliar with 
them, but this might indeed allow us to estimate the user base.

The chunk with the 64-bit comment actually is independent of the high UID
problem. It's there to prevent logging of wromng data on 64-bit arches, 
and is completely optimized away by the compiler on 32 bit ones.
I could as well separate it into a different patch.
I'll do a new version of the patch anyways, as I missed to change another 
comment.

Yes, but how often do your users use more that 49 days of cputime?
I'll wait a bit to see whether my other posting generates any feedback.
