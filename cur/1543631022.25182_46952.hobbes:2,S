you're on the right track if you want to freeze up your machine. :)
ok, here we go:
netif_rx is called from the driver, and at this point of skbs
livetime you can just be sure about the datalink layer beeing
decapsulated (called by the driver (e.g. eth_type_trans)).
so this means: you have a valid skb->mac.ras well as the skb->data
beeing a pointer to your network layer. - and that's about it ...
if you want to know about IP headers, you should hook into the network
subsystem at the IP layer (and there's already a nice NF_HOOK
- called NF_IP_LOCAL_IN)
anyhow - try to use the infrastructure which is already there.
