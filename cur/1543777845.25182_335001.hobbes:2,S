-march implies -mtune and also implies thing like -msse2 for the
instruction set where applicable. 
I think -march=pentium4 is equivalent to -mmmx -msse -msse2
-mtune=pentium4 ( if I have not fogotten anything ).  
Pentium4 supports things like sse2 and mmx which AFAIK plain i686 does
not. I first thought that maybe the kernel was destabilized by such
optimizations, but k8 has all of them and more ( sse3 ). 
So, if it is ok to build the k8 kernel with -march=k8 why is it not ok
to built the p4 kernel with -march=pentium4 ? 
I may be wrong, but any way I think of it it looks like a performance
hit to build a p4 kernel with -march=i686.
