Subject: NFS Filesystem Size Limit?

I have a question I could not quickly find on Google/mailing lists--
Say I have some sort of global filesystem or NFS which is 200TB.
Is there a limit either:
A) In the Linux kernel
or
B) In the NFS spec
That would limit the client as to what it could see via NFS or global 
filesystem?
Or could both 2.4 and 2.6 kernels 'see' the 200TB global filesystem over 
NFS or global filesystem?
Justin.
