We build a lot of custom boards that have odd clocks to generate very
odd baud rates for random serial devices. The Bxxx style has been a
thorn in my side since 1999.
Also, Oxford's 16PCI95x family has three different points of altering
the clock; the clock prescaler, the actual sample rate (which is the
classic /16 that most are used to), and the actual divisor. That can
produce pretty much any baud rate, albeit with some error.
