Hi Ingo, Steven,
I had been working on some ideas related to saving context switches in the
bottom-half mechanisms on -rt.  So far, the ideas have been a flop, but a few
peripheral technologies did come out of it.  This series is one such
idea that I thought might have some merit on its own.  The header-comments
describe it in detail, so I wont bother replicating that here.
This series applies to 24-rt1.  Any comments/feedback welcome.
-Greg
