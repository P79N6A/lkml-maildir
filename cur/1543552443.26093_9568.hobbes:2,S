A while ago I hacked 2.2.17 to use larger pipe buffers. On my own pure
throughput benchmark (two processes ping-pongging one buffer's worth of data
on a single-CPU system), buffers larger than 4KB hardly gave any advantage.
64KB buffers were marginally (10-20%) faster, but performance dropped quite
considerably after that (cache effects, maybe...).
After seeing these results I simply assumed that 4KB had been deliberately
chosen as the optimal buffer size, rather than by luck =).
Now, Dave Miller's kiobuf pipes may change the picture somewhat...
