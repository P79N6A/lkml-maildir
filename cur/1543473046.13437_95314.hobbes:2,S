Indeed, even statically linked on my FreeBSD system, that's only 40960 bytes 
in size.  Change the printf's to fputs calls, and it shrinks to 16384 bytes.
Hardly worth all the hoopla, and certainly not of enough utility to
warrant putting it in the kernel.  Then again, Dave is arguing that you
might not be able to rely upon ``yes'' or ``tr'' even being available,
so he's either grasping at straws, or unwilling to admit that such a
situation is far removed from ordinary use.
