Just for clarification. What you are saying is that anyone who insists 
on contributing to the kernel under GPLv3 - that code would be 
prohibited from being included in the kernel? That to contribute to the 
kernel you must contribute under the terms presently in place?
I'm just asking for clarification.
I don't have a GPLv3 opinion yet since it's a changing document. But I 
do see a need for a consistent licensing of the components of Linux to 
avoid confusion and I'm worried that if any GPLv3 gets in then it will 
be all GPLv3 so you would have to prohibity that if you are going to 
stop Linux from becoming GPLv3 by default.
