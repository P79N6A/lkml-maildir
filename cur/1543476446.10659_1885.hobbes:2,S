How did you manage that? Unless you refer to CLONE_PID, I'm not aware of
any such behaviour.

Yes, but the wait_queue is now in the parents task_struct, not the
mm_struct. And sharing the mm doesn't prevent either task going away, it
just means the mm won't get released until all tasks using it exit.

Sorry, I still don't seem to be following you. Are you referring to the
fact that the vfork()'d child will, until it calls exec, be
multi-threading with the co-threads of the parent? Yes, that is an issue,
but it sounds like it can safely be left to the programmer. Everything can
safely wait until the parent resumes execution.

The point is that multiple threads aren't running on the _same_ user
stack, despite running in the same VM. The clone() syscall is needed to
set up each thread with an individual stack. vfork() leaves both the
parent and child running on the same stack, meaning A) the child must
complete execution before the parent can resume, B) the child cannot go
further up the stack then the parent, C) you'll probably need to code the
vfork() syscall a macro so that it does not involve a function call, as
this would automatically violate B.
If you want to avoid the stack problems altogether, you'll need to
allocate a new stack for the child. Then the user code needs to look
something like this: 
	child_stack = malloc(4096);
	pid = clone(CLONE_VM|CLONE_VFORK, child_stack);
	if (!pid) {
		exec();
		_exit();
	} else {
		free(child_stack);
	}
The VFORK logic is still needed to keep the parent and child synchronized,
to prevent the parent from freeing the memory before the child is done
executing. I can't think of any trivial way of getting the memory properly
freed up without synchronization of some sort. 
The true vfork() implementation avoids the cost of the memory allocation
(which could, admittedly, be handled by a single static allocation), and
looks something like this:
	pid = asm(" call SYS_vfork ");
	if (!pid) {
		exec();
		_exit();
	}
(Or at least, the above is how I'm familiar with everything from uClinux. 
I don't think any of this is incorrect for desktop Linux, but feel free to
correct me.)

OK, I'll take your word for it. :-)
