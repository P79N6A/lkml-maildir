space around "=", please.
Many people prefer not to do the multiple-definitions-per-line, btw:
	int merge_done = 0;
	int uninitialized = 0;
reasons:
- If gives you some space for a nice comment
- It makes patches much more readable, and it makes rejects easier to fix
- standardisation.

Kenrel convention is to put spaces around "-"

eek, scary BUG_ON.  Do we really need to be that severe?  Would it be
better to warn and run ext4_error() here?

The preferred style is
	err = ext4_ext_get_access(handle, inode, path + depth);
	if (err)

Sigh.  I hope you guys know how all this works, because the extent code is
a mystery to me.  Is the on-disk layout and the allocation strategy
described anywhere?

Again, I do think that sticking the identifiers in there helps
readability.  Although it is not as important in a boring old declaration
as it is in, say, inode_operations, etc.
Please try to keep the code looking nice in an 80-column display.
