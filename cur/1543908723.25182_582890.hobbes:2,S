I'm worried that -mm isn't getting a lot of exposure these days. People do 
run it, but I wonder how many..
That said, a lot of machines won't ever use MMCFG (especially the old ones 
- and most of the new ones would run x86-64), so that probably explains at 
least that one.
But the x86-64 alternates code would hit anybody who had the "use rep movs 
for best performance" code, and I'm surprised that one wasn't caught 
earlier. X86_FEATURE_REP_GOOD is not uncommon (Core 2 has it). So I assume 
that one wasn't really in -mm at all.
