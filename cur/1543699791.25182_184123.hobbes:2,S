You ought to put in one of those magic headers that says so (I don't see
one in your messages, though maybe I overlooked something), as you can
hardly expect everybody to remember who's subscribed to the list and
who's not.
[No I don't remember what they are; I don't care about duplicate
replies, in fact I _like_ duplicate replies (because it means I usually
get a copy faster than what goes through the list reflector).]
