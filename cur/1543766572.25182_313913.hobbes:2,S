Actually, some cpufreq drivers *should* do their speed transitions with
all PCI mastering disabled. The lack of any infrastructure to quiesce drivers
and prevent new DMA transactions from occuring whilst the transition occurs
means that currently.. we don't.  So +1 for any driver model work that
may lead to something we can use here.
This is the main reason the longhaul cpufreq driver is currently busted.
That it ever worked at all is a miracle.
