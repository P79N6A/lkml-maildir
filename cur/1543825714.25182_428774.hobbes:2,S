Subject: [PATCH] Add Sierra Wireless MC5720 ID to airprime.c
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The Sierra Wireless MC5720 is an embedded EV-DO module which is shipping 
with a number of laptops.  This change adds its ID to the airprime.c usb 
serial driver, so that it appears as a serial device.
As an aside, people have reported that it is necessary to increase the 
max packet size in usb-serial.c in order to get good throughput with 
these devices; there's a patch floating around to do this.  Is this a 
reasonable thing to do?  (I guess I'll post my variation of the patch 
and see what discussion comes up...)
