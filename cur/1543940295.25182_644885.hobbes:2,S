Great, thanks.

We had it there before /sys/fs and as has been noted, it's ABI so we can't
change it right away. In theory, it's actually outside the fs, but in
reality it's pretty tied to Ocfs2, so I have no objection to the idea of it
being eventually moved there.

Yeah, that sounds entirely reasonable. It shouldn't be too hard for us to
fix up ocfs2-tools to look in both places. So long as there's enough lead
time for users to upgrade their toolchain (we can do releases for all
branches of ocfs2-tools, make annoucements on lists, etc), I think the
impact shouldn't be too bad.

No problem. I'll get us some patches to symlink things, and add docs in
Documentation/ABI/ explaining how Ocfs2 and userspace communicate. In the
future, as we add ABI it'll be documented there.
