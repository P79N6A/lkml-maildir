	"'The Linux port resulted from a strong user demand', said John
Lenyo, director of marketing at Model Technology.  'To gauge general
demand, we mentioned it casually in our quarterly newsletter,' he said.
'You would have thought we were giving away free money.  About two days
after that newsletter went out we were bombarded with requests from
customers.'"
