AMD 760MP and 760MPX, both have this problem.

Installed.

It hasn't been disabled (the BIOS doesn't have that option).

CONFIG_MK7=y
CONFIG_NOHIGHMEM=y
CONFIG_MTRR=y
CONFIG_X86_UP_IOAPIC=y
CONFIG_X86_IO_APIC=y
CONFIG_X86_LOCAL_APIC=y
but CONFIG_X86_IO_APIC can be turned off and the problem still persists.

The problem is present both with and without ACPI.

Well, the second CPU is there, and there are no problems with the APIC and 
the IO-APIC if the kernel is compiled with CONFIG_SMP=y. Only the UP case 
causes the problem. So I don't think the bus itself is noisy, unless the 
noises are produced by the second CPU somehow, and we can't do anything 
about it because we're not touching that second CPU.

Thanks for emailing back. :)
Yeah, I noticed your name in most of the relevant changes between
2.4.10-pre11 and pre12, so I was going to email you directly after 
narrowing it down some more. Right now I'm trying to isolate the smallest 
portion of the pre11-pre12 patch that triggers the problem.
But if you have any ideas or patches to try, please do let me know...

Thanks, I'll try to get it.
I know that AMD's K7 APIC is supposed to be compatible with the Intel P6 
APIC, but do you think there might be some incompatibility between that 
that causes this? Or perhaps some undefined behavior we rely on, and which 
is different between Intel and AMD?...
Anyway, I'll keep on digging.
Thanks,
Ion
