well, I've got a Wearnes 32x CD, that works fine under 2.0.xx, but only
works as pure cdrom drive under 2.1.xx (no audio, no eject, no extra
features - but you can still mount it and read iso9660 filesystems) 
In fact, you get no messages out of the kernel about it - it fails when
you try to query the drive for it's configuration.
IMHO, the ide-cd driver shouldn't ever just silently fail, but give some
reason for returning without setting anything..
