Well, here is a version for Linux:
------------------------------------------------------------
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
int main(void)
{
	int fd;
	unsigned char data;
	printf("Disabling WiFi whitelist check.\n");
	fd = open("/dev/nvram", O_RDWR);
	lseek(fd, 0x6a, SEEK_SET);
	read(fd, &data, 1);
	printf("CMOS address 0x6a: %02x->", data);
	data &= ~0x80;
	printf("%02x\n", data);
	lseek(fd, 0x6a, SEEK_SET);
	write(fd, &data, 1);
	close(fd);
	printf("Done.\n");
}
------------------------------------------------------------
I've tried it on my ThinkPad X31, but it doesn't work at all. The CMOS
has a value 0xfa at the offset 0x6a, so the most upper bit is already
set.
