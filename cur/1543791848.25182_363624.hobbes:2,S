no problem
@Judd + Tobias: this is a ide-cs trouble thing that exists in arch with 
default udev rules as of 071-1

 | Heh, the poor-man's udev worked for someone :)
:D ... true, sometimes one has to do things manually to have it done.
 | The problem is in your udev rules. You are running something in them 
 | that is opening up your ide-cs device, which causes another hotplug
 | event to happen, which causes udev to run again, and so on.
thanx for the explaination. i'm using archlinux and it seems that i'm the 
only one who uses ide-cs and therefore ran into this trouble. i just 
added
BUS=="ide", SYSFS{removable}="1", GOTO="no_volume_id"
BUS=="ide", SYSFS{../removable}="1", GOTO="no_volume_id"
to /etc/udev/rules.d/udev.rules
as other distros use to ignore removable ide's. now i need to load the 
ide-cs module by hand (bad thing, as module should be loaded 
automagically with udev/hotplug) but on the other hand, no more 
dmesg-spamming, no freezes and also the node is created successfully 
after module is loaded. 
is there some other rules that may be usefull adding in this case? 
is there planed action to change ide-cs to work without making it being 
ignored ... without this exception that needs to be specified in udev 
rules? 
thank you for the analysis and the workaround that i'm now using to have 
ide-cs working again. making it behave like any other ide would be cool, 
but is only aesthetical for me, as things work now :)
greetings,
Damir
