First of all, bravo for doing this in an architecture-independent way.
Very nice.
I'd really prefer to keep the 'struct resource' handling out of the
memory hotplug code.  This took a nice, little, comprehensible for loop,
and made it quite a bit more complex.  There is also a lot of casting
going on, which I don't really grasp in a first glance.
The 'struct resource' which gets passed into find_next_system_ram()
isn't a real resource.  Why not just pass a normal start and end address
in there, and let _it_ do the work?
It looks like that whole loop is optimized for being able to online a
really sparse area without diving into the iomem tables very often.
This seems like a premature complicating optimization to me.  
Why not do something like this:
	for (i = 0; i < nr_pages; i++) {
		struct page *page = pfn_to_page(pfn + i);
		if (page_is_in_io_resource(page))
			continue;
		online_page(page);
		onlined_pages++;
	}
That way, you keep the memory_hotplug.c file nice and neat.
Also, remind me again why you can't just make the SECTION_SIZE match
your 64MB I/O hole sizes.  I forget a lot/ :)
