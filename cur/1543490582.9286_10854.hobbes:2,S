Is there anyone out in Linuxland working on something I would call
"CPU management"? I would really like to help on that.
What I understand under "CPU management" and why I want it:
Walking over the CeBIT fair in Hannover I've seen many really big
servers having 4+ CPUs. I was really impressed by the power of
the 8x Pentium-III-Xeon servers.
I'm sure it won't be long until we'll see servers which have CPUs
that could be removed or added while running. (And, yes - these
machines are already there, but all these are really BigIrons from
Sun, SGI, IBM etc.)
Therefore I think Linux should be capable of dealing with CPUs being added
or removed during normal business. YMMV, opinions?
