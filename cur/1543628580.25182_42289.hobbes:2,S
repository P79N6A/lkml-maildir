Never seen that, and nobody reported that. Are you sure that
vmmon/vmnet modules choosen by vmware-config.pl are correct ones?
If you exprience any problems, you should run 'vmware-config.pl --compile',
it will cause vmmon/vmnet to be build from scratch even if your
kernel looks like one for which precompiled module is available.
And next question - do you use vmmon/vmnet from VMware, or from my
site?
