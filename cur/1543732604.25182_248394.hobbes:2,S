i have solved the fundamental SMP latency problems in the -Q7 patch, by
redesigning how SMP preemption is done. Here's the relevant changelog
entry:
[...]
the main change in this patch are more SMP latency fixes. The stock
kernel, even with CONFIG_PREEMPT enabled, didnt have any spin-nicely
preemption logic for the following, commonly used SMP locking
primitives: read_lock(), spin_lock_irqsave(), spin_lock_irq(),
spin_lock_bh(), read_lock_irqsave(), read_lock_irq(), read_lock_bh(),
write_lock_irqsave(), write_lock_irq(), write_lock_bh(). Only
spin_lock() and write_lock() [the two simplest cases] where covered.
In addition to the preemption latency problems, the _irq() variants in
the above list didnt do any IRQ-enabling while spinning - possibly
resulting in excessive irqs-off sections of code!
-Q7 fixes all of these latency problems: we now re-enable interrupts
while spinning in all possible cases, and a spinning op stays
preemptible if this is a beginning of a new critical section.

the latest patch is:
  
http://redhat.com/~mingo/voluntary-preempt/voluntary-preempt-2.6.9-rc1-bk4-R0
i'm already in the process of cleaning up the patch and making it ready
for splitup & merge. The spinlock fixes will be amongst the first
patches i'll send you.
