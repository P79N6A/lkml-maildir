Yes, but I should see the real final return value in another strace 
output line before I see that thread doing something else.  Correct?  
Here's the strace output again.  Look at what thread 11079 does:
[pid 11079] accept(3,  <unfinished ...>
[pid 11093] restart_syscall(<... resuming interrupted call ...>
<unfinished ...>
[pid  8799] --- SIGSTOP (Stopped (signal)) @ 0 (0) ---
[pid 11079] <... accept resumed> 0xbfdaa73c, [16]) = ? ERESTARTSYS (To
be restarted)
[pid  8799] read(6,  <unfinished ...>
[pid 11079] fcntl64(-512, F_SETFD, FD_CLOEXEC) = -1 EBADF (Bad file descriptor)
strace reports accept() returning ERESTARTSYS, and the next thing we 
see from that thread is the call to fcntl(), which is the next thing 
that my code does.
