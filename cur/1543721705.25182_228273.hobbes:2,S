i forgot to say that some applications doesn't work properly
example: "beep"  when i execute beep i hear no sounds, neither from speakers (audio card)
nor from internal pc speaker.
in kde environment kconsole doesn't beep too.
mplayer seems to have some problem using the alsa output, giving strange messages.
(using oss emulation works good, with the only bad sound quality problem)
xmms with alsa plugin works good without any warning or problem.
