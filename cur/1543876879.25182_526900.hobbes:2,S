no, but that's what we're wanting with serial ports as well. a system with 50 
serial ports should have them numbered 0-49, not typea0-5, typeb0-39, typec0-5

people working with ~50 serial ports or ethernet ports aren't useing stock 
distros anyway.

I would reverse this. instead of having a bunch of different names and then 
requiring a tool to create sane names from them, start off with a nice nameing 
scheme and have a tool that tells you the under-the-covers details.
so leave all the ports numbered 0-49, but let people who need to know run a 
tool (even if it's dmesg -s 200000 |grep ttyS) to learn the details of what 
hardware is used to run what port.
for 99.99% of the users they will never need to use this tool (things will just 
work becouse they only have one type, or someone else put lables on the box 
before shipping it to you), and in the other 0.01% of the users, they are 
running a tool anyway to get the gory details of things so it isn't a big 
harship for them.
