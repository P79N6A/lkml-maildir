Hi Enrico,

No, sorry. It's not even in -mm yet (in fact it's even not in Greg's
bk-i2c tree yet). It needs to spend some time (and get some testing) in
-mm before it can go to Linus.
You are still welcome to get the patch [1] and apply it manually to your
tree if you want support right now. And of course, report to the
Aurélien and the sensors mailing-list if you hit a problem.
