Subject: [PATCH] nfsd to unlock kernel before exiting
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The nfsd holds the big kernel lock upon exit, when it really shouldn't.
Not to mention that this breaks Ingo's RT patch. This is a trivial fix
to release the lock.
Ingo, this patch also works with your kernel, and stops the problem with
nfsd.
Note, there's a "goto out;" where "out:" is right above svc_exit_thread.
The point of the goto also holds the kernel_lock, so I don't see any
problem here in releasing it.
