Unless you implement page migration for all caches it's still there.
The only way to get rid of caches on a node currently is to throw them
away.  And refetching them from disk is quite costly.

Why not? It has to work with the real existing VM, not some imaginary perfect
one.

d/icaches for once don't work this way. Do a find / and watch the results on
your local node.  
And in practice your assumption of everything clean and nice in page cache is 
also often not true.

Yes, but with message passing but without any kind of shared memory.

Ok we agree on that then. Great.
