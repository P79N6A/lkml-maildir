Way cool. Perhaps there are plainspotter mailinglists out there who would be
very interested in this, and could possibly confirm it.
But I can't discount the Mau Tai theory - not too many companies have
private planes anymore, and not too many individuals either. I did hear once
that eiter Brian or Dennis had his own quite serious plane, but I don't
think they would endow theirs with a tux :-)
