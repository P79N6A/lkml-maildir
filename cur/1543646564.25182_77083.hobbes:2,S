See WHY THIS SHOULD BE CHANGED #3 "Forces better coding structures and
procedures..."  Frankly, error controls should have been programmed into
the code anyway.  It's just good programming practice.

While I respectively disagree with you, I really don't care which set of
functions/macros are eliminated for consolidation purposes.  My original
point still stands that maintaining duplicate functions -- well, near
duplicate with the exception of the returned error code -- is a waste of
time, resources, and coding, and for the purpose of simplified
maintenance, one of the sets of duplicate functions/macros should be
eliminated.
