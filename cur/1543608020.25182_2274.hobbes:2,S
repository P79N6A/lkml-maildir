That is a religous question here for some people.  There are several
different opinions.  Some say they use abcFS for this feature, and others
say that that feature has already been though of and passed over for a
better solution...

I tend to rename the directory with a descriptive name of which patches are
applied.
$ ls /usr/src/lk2.4
2.4.13freeswan-1.91+ac5+preempt+netdev_random+vm_freeswap
Also, I modify the toplevel makefile file to reflect which patches are
applied.  This way, each kernel has its' own set of modules too, which can
be important because some patches will make ther modules incompatible.
$ head 2.4.13freeswan-1.91+ac5+preempt+netdev_random+vm_freeswap/Makefile
VERSION = 2
PATCHLEVEL = 4
SUBLEVEL = 13
EXTRAVERSION = freeswan-1.91+ac5+preempt+netdev_random+vm_freeswap
$ ls /lib/modules/
2.2.20pre10_raid-2219A1_ext3-007a_eide-05042001
2.4.10-ac10-smp-preempt
2.4.10-ac11+smp+preempt+vm_hogstop
2.4.12-ac3+netdev_ramdom+preempt+vm_hogstop2
2.4.12-ac3+netdev_ramdom+preempt+vm_hogstop2+account-rand-cleanup

If you have 2.4.0 you patch it with the 2.4.1-patch.  You can keep going
with 2.4.2, 2.4.3, etc.  As long as you have the next consecutive patch you
can go forever.
If you wanted to, you could patch all the way from 2.0.0 up to 2.4.13 with
enough steps.  Though, you'd probably kill your hard drive... ;)

Questions like these are why we have www.kernelnewbies.org, and the kernel
faq which is listed at the bottom of this and every message.
