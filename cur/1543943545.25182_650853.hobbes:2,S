No worry, this patch wont go anywhere near mainline as long as it
breaks stuff and obviously you are under no obligation to re-test
patches that have not been changed just re-submitted.
x86 changes, which are considered for mainline are staged in the mm
branch of the x86 git tree:
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/x86/linux-2.6-x86.git;a=shortlog;h=mm
Instructions for checking it out are here:
http://people.redhat.com/mingo/x86.git/README
Please let us know, if there is anything which breaks your box(en).
Thanks for your feedback and patience.
