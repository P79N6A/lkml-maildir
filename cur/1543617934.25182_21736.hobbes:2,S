FWIW, I just built this and did a kernel compile+updatedb+xmms
test.  Normally (Red Hat's  2.4.7), xmms skips like mad under those
circumstances, with this patch it didn't skip at all.  And system "feel"
is good.
Not scientific numbers, and maybe not all that useful given the
huge number of variables in the patch, but I figured I'd throw it
out here.
Thanks for putting this patch up, Jussi.
