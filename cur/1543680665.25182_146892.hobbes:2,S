Is there any expected or planned timeframe to finalize the pre-2.6
series and end up with a stable 2.6.0 kernel?
I'm worried about the current status of the 2.5 kernel scheduler. I know
that Con is working hard to nail down all the problems that some people
like me are having. I don't still feel comfortable with it, and although
Con patches are several orders of magnitude better than stock scheduler,
there are minor problems.
Sometime ago, I made down a combo patch and, sincerely, it's the one I'm
using the most for my desktop boxes as it's the one that gets better
response times and interactive feeling. For my server boxes, neither my
combo patch, neither Con or stock do feel good when the system is under
heavy load. It suffers from starvation. Simply doing a "tar jxvf" makes
logging into the system a PITA.
Just my 2 cents.
