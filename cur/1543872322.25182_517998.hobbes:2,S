sorry, i worded that *really* badly.  i didn't mean to imply that
*you* were incapable of understanding what the patch represented --
i've seen enough of your posts to appreciate your technical expertise.
all i want to know is if the proposed patch making
include/asm-generic/ioctl.h more flexible is even *theoretically* a
feasible thing to do, or whether anyone on this list would have any
howling objections to it.
not only that, but i would *prefer* to submit just that file as a
first patch all by itself since, again theoretically, it shouldn't
break anything and i'd like to verify that first before trying to
simplify any of the arch-specific ioctl.h files one at a time.
as it is, the number of arch-specific ioctl.h files that could
potentially be made *much* shorter are for the arches:
  mips
  parisc
  alpha
  sparc
  sparc-64
  powerpc
all the rest simply include asm-generic/ioctl.h directly.
rday
p.s.  for those who may have come in late, the proposed new
asm-generic/ioctl.h file would allow an includer to override any or
all of:
  _IOC_SIZEBITS
  _IOC_DIRBITS
  _IOC_NONE
  _IOC_WRITE
  _IOC_READ
AFAICT, those are the only differences across the entire spectrum of
ioctl.h files.  if there's something i've missed, feel free to let me
know.
