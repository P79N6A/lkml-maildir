   TTBOM, depending on what's driven by device on -IOCS16, this will 
translate into 2, 3, or 4 cycles at the successive addresses. In case of 
the IDE data register, this should translate into one 16-bit cycle at 
0x1x0, one 8-bit cycle at 0x1x1, and one 8-bit cycle at 0x1x2 which is 
of course not what anybody would want...
WBR, Sergei
