Ah, ok, this makes sense.. Will try the same. Btw: one more question wrt the
IRQ prios:
Let's assume i have IRQ 0 at 80, my soundcard and the rtc irq both at prio
98 and all others around 40. Now the rtc handler should never get in the way
of the soundcard irq if the rtc is simply not used right? And of course, the
other way around, too. the soundcard irq should not get in the way of the
rtc handler if the soundcard simply is not used and not generating IRQ's?

not yet.
