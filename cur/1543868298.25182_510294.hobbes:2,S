This is common and suggested practice but the PCI specs don't require
it. There is no rule - you can, for example, have all INT lines
connected to a single CPU IRQ input.

Anyway, something has to know how the IRQs are routed. BIOS, other
firmware, Linux.

Actually it has to be wired consistently with the BIOS (which is
probably consistent with chipset manufacturer's instructions).

Usually they are just bus splitters, they route IRQs and IDSELs
(and maybe JTAG) as required by the BIOS, all others pins are
connected 1:1.
I.e., they are completely transparent, generally comply to PCI specs
and are dedicated to a specific motherboard(s).

Actually I think (would have to check the specs for sure) every
subdevice (function) may use just one interrupt line.
This rotating INTx scheme is common because it's cheap. There are
systems which support more than 4 shared INTs per bus, for example
you can have different sets of 4 INTx lines for every PCI slot, even
if all slots are on the same PCI bus.

Correct. This scheme assumes at most 4 single-function devices
on the bus, otherwise INTs are shared.
