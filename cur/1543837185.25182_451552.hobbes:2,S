Subject: What's the NFS OOM problem?

I often heard of the OOM probelm in NFS, but don't know what it is.
Now I am developing a NFS based system and found my system memory
(server side) is used too fast. I checked the code but didn't find
memory leaking. So I suspect I run into OOM issue.
Can someone help me and give me a brief description on OOM issue?
Many many thanks!
