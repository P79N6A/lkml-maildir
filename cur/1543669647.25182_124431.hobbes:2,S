Well, that's maybe what _you_ want to call your disks and partitions,
but not what I want to call them :)

No, there isn't.  That's what I am trying to completely avoid with udev.
It will allow you to plug in whatever device naming scheme that you
want.  This will keep all of the disc vs. disk flamewars from every
happening in the kernel community (well, I can hope...)
I'll be providing a small default name scheme that happens to match the
current Documentation/devices.txt names, and possibly a devfs naming
scheme for those people who like that scheme.  After that, it will be
quite easy for you to create a Oracle naming scheme where you give
different prefixes to your partitions vs. disks.
This scheme allows you to use databases, flat files, or even send a
message across the network to a admin console to get the name of a new
device.  Much more flexible than setting a kernel naming scheme, and
moves this whole argument and policy out of the kernel.
thanks,
