I've had 2.2.18 go into an infinite kernel loop with that message when
running out of memory.  ALT+SysRq would respond and print what it tries to
do, but never actually accomplish it. (i.e., it'd say "Syncing disks." but
never actually do it.) Apparently userspace never ran again because sockets
would be accepted still but never progress.
