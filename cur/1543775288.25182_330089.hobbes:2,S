Hmm, I do like to read the comments, see below.

When I said _hypothetical_ I ment it.  That's basically stating that the
situation wont happen, but lets pretend that it will. And no, SMP signals
(on intel anyway) are sent with send_IPI_* which even smp_call_function
uses.

And if you had read my other emails you would have noticed that I
even mentioned this particular comment. When I said:
"This is probably the reason it is not allowed to call most IPIs from
interrupt or bottom half context."
Also, a comment doesn't force this, and there's no test in
smp_call_function that prevents a user from calling this form a
bottom_half!
