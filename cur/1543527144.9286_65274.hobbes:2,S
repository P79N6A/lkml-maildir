What are you refering to with "multimedia load" ?
Any realtime stuff (like audio playback in my case) needs
deterministic execution times.
And the worst case is the case which we need to analyze.
Therefore if the worst case is 1000ms and the average case 2ms
we are still in a bad situation.
That is why we must find a way to trigger extreme cases.
(like big mem on a slow CPU etc)
Benno.
