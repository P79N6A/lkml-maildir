...Until Linux 2.0.34 or so (can't remember the exact version number)
which had the workaround for this bug, about a week after the bug was

And I was reminded in private mail that the correct lockup sequence is
actually
  char main[]={0xf0,0x0f,0xc7,0xc8};
where the 0xc8 can be anything from 0xc8 to 0xcf.
