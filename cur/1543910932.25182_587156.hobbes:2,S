Hmm, I thought the patch was only supposed to make a real difference
if you have multiple devices? But you only got a single disk.   
At least that was the case  it was supposed to fix: starvation of fast 
devices from slow devices.
Ok perhaps the new adaptive dirty limits helps your single disk
a lot too. But your improvements seem to be more "collateral damage" @)
But if that was true it might be enough to just change the dirty limits
to get the same effect on your system. You might want to play with
/proc/sys/vm/dirty_*
