I don't think the security issues with this will ever make it
worthwhile.
Consider:
1) euid is not sufficient, you need to store away arbitrary LSM
information and call LSM hooks to decide security equivalence. The same
applies to VServer or whatever other container system you use.
2) Two processes, A and B, are in separate VFS namespaces but have
equivalent security identity according to LSM. Process A reads data from
file F which is not visible in process's B's namespace. You have to
prevent process B from ever getting a page that once contained data from
file F.
3) mlock() is often used by programs like GPG to prevent decrypted
secret keys from ever getting swapped out. You need to zero all
once-mlocked pages before they get reused to prevent that page from
getting swapped to disk or application bugs from leaking the key.
