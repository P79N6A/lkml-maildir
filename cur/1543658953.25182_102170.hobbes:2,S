The benchmarks are likely an accurate, good faith
measurement of the stated systems, and ngpt is
obviously an improvement over the old linuxthreads -
But according to my understanding, a more accurate
measure of nptl performance would require a current
glibc, with the nptl-specific enhancements -
or am I missing something here?
