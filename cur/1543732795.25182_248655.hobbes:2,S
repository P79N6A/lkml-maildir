I have an USB zip drive in combination with udev.
When I connect the drive with a disk inserted, everything works
fine. Here is the udev rule:
BUS="usb", SYSFS{product}="USB Zip 750", KERNEL="sd?1",
NAME="%k", SYMLINK="zip"
When connecting the drive without a disk the symlink is not
created. This is ok, beceause there is no disk.
But if I now insert a disk, there is still no symlink?
I've search a bit on google and if I understand correctly the
main problem is the SCSI protocol.
Is there a solution to this problem?
I hope this is the right list to ask this.
