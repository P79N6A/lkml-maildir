I think you should drop CONFIG_COMPAT_VDSO support for 32-bit VDSO on
64-bit kernel.  This was only to hack around a broken version of glibc
that shipped with SUSE PRO 9.0, which had broken assertions based on
misinterpretation of ELF fields.  64-bit machines will never see this
glibc and the hack can die.
Perhaps it is finally time to remove the hack from 32-bit as well, and
eliminate COMPAT_VDSO entirely?  Or does it really have to live forever.
