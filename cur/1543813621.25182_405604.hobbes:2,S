Something to remember:
1) TLVs are essentially giving you the flexibility to send optionally
appearing elements. It is up to the receiver (in the kernel or user
space) to check for the presence of mandatory elements or execute things
depending on the presence of certain TLVs. Example in your case:
if the tgid TLV appears then the user is requesting for that TLV
if the pid appears then they are requesting for that
if both appear then it is the && of the two.
You should always ignore TLVs you dont understand - to allow for forward
compatibility.
2)  The "T" part is essentially also encoding (semantically) what size
the value is; the "L" part is useful for validation. So the receiver
will always know what the size of the TLV is by definition and uses the
L to make sure it is the right size. Reject what is of the wrong size.
