It's now looking like this change won't be needed after all: Andi has
just posted a patch in the "ipr" thread which should stop x86_64 from
interfering with the scatterlist *page,offset,length fields, so what
IB and others were doing should then work safely (current thinking is
that x86_64 is the only architecture which coalesced in that way).
