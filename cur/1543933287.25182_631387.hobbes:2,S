I applied it to #upstream (2.6.25) since forcedeth is not on any 
big-endian platforms AFAIK.
Is it .24 material for some obvious reason, which I missed?  :)

I have an epic100 card too if you need it (though it sounds like you 
have something testable).

Awesome :)

xircom_tulip_cb should probably be deleted, since it is the crappier of 
the two drivers for the same hardware (xircom_cb being the other one).
xircom_cb _the driver_ is pretty odd.  It is less like tulip than it 
should be, actually.  There are several things that could have been done 
to improve the throughput/etc. of the driver, but it was more important 
at the time to simply find a driver that always worked.  IIRC its RX 
filtering was broken, implying the need to enable promisc mode just to 
receive packets normally.
