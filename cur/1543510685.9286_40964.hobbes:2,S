_Exactly_. The problem I'd like to solve is not "how, exactly, does
the memory allocator work?" but rather "how should I allocate memory?
which functions should I use in which circumstances?", for example.
I'd also like to see something similar to document API changes -- a
few lines of "<foo> changed to <bar>, here's how to update your code"
along with a brief explanation of why the change happened would go a
long way.
I'm sort of ambivalent on the idea of inline documentation, though,
since I think it asks for a little too much discipline -- I think it's 
easier to just knock out a brief summary of an interface than to make
sure that there's documentation in a format that the extraction script 
can understand in each of the proper places.
