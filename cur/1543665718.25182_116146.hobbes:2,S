	I just verified that the problem also occurs with NUMA +
HIGHMEM_64GB (i.e., it is not limited to HIGHMEM_4GB).
	By the way, HIGHMEM_64GB without NUMA gets a lot father, but
still experiences memory corruption, probably same bug that caused me
to downgrade to HIGHMEM_4G months ago (i.e., probably not related to
this NUMA problem).

	I want a kernel that is as broadly hardware compatible as
possible and can take advantage of as much hardware as possible, in
that order.  So, I guess I hope to reactivate CONFIG_NUMA once this
problem is solved.
