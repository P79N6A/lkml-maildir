Hi all...
Since begin of the ages the build of the nvidia driver says things like
this:
include/asm/compat.h:210: warning: pointer of type 'void *' used in arithmetic
There are several of this warnings. The code in question for this example
is:
static __inline__ void __user *compat_alloc_user_space(long len)
{
    struct pt_regs *regs = task_pt_regs(current);
    return (void __user *)regs->rsp - len;
}
As this is dealing with mem blocks, I suppose it's counting in bytes, so
we could do something like:
   return (void __user *)((u8*)regs->rsp - len);
so the arithmetic knows how to inc/dec for each unity...
I think the warning is correct and that void* arithmetic is undefined in C,
isn't it ?
TIA
