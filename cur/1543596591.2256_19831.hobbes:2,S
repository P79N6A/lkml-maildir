Upon further investigation and testing, it turned out that the kernel was not 
at fault - the problem was high mutex contention, which caused frequent 
context switches, and the idle CPU was apparently from the scheduler waiting 
for the original CPU to become available too often.
On a side note, it would be nice if a process could communicate to the kernel 
that it would rather run on the first available CPU than wait for the perfect 
one to become available.
