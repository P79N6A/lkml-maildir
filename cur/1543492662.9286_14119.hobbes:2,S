This patch forks fine. I have tested various scenarios: small transactions
(ping-pong), small transactions intermixed with some with more data so
windowing starts, and long transfers with large windows. There are no
superfluous 50ms delays any more on the Mac side, and no superfluous
ACK's either.
Thanks a lot!
