Just a very unscientific observation: my laptop emits a noise when the
ethernet is used.  The pitch depends on the transfer rate.  When
communicating with a working machine, and receiving from the ax8817,
there is a continuous high-pitch sound.  When sending to the ax8817,
the sound has a much lower pitch (not surprising) and is also
intermittent with bursts lasting < 1/2 second followed by an
approximately 1/2 second pause.  The lights on the switch behave
similarly.
