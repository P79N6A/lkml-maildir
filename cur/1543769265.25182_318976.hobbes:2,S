If it has a serial port, sure, just use a serial console.
If it doesn't, try removing the DVD during boot, then plug it back in
again and trigger a device add
echo scsi add-single-device <n> 0 1 0 > /proc/scsi/scsi
where <n> is whatever SCSI number the rest of your CD-ROM's appear on
(it was 1 in your first trace).
