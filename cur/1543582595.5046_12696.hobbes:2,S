Hello. Is there a way, when running a non-SMP kernel, to detect or
otherwise tell (software only; the machine is 2400 miles away) if the
system has SMP capibilties? Would /proc/cpuinfo show two CPUs if the
kernel is non-SMP?  Thanks!
(btw, the kernel in question is a stock RH6.2 kernel 2.2.14-5, and yes, I 
know I should update it anyways and that a SMP kernel will run on a UP
system)
