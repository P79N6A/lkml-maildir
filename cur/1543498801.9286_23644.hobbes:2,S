   What's the advantage in doing this?   From casually looking at the
   code, it looks like it will drop a whopping 64 instructions out of
   the kernel.  Leave it in; it gives a nice piece of history, plus
   it won't bite people when they drag their ancient MCC setups out
   and load a 2.2 kernel over them.
