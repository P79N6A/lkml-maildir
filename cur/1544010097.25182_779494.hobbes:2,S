Then you fix that instead of working around it! :-)

Just start the first thread without CLONE_IO, and subsequent threads
fork off that with CLONE_IO set? I think we need to make sure that we
allocate an IO context for the 'parent' if it doesn't have one already
and CLONE_IO is set, but that is something that can easily be rectified.
It may seem more complex, but if you use this approach you are pretty
much free to worry about any changes in the future there.
