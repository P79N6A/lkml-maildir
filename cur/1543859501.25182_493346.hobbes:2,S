If so, "cancel_dirty_page()" may actually be the right thing to use, but 
only if you can guarantee that the page isn't mapped anywhere (and from 
the name of the function I guess it's not something that you'll ever map?)
So the JFS code _looks_ like you could just replace the
	clear_page_dirty(page);
with
	cancel_dirty_page(page, PAGE_CACHE_SIZE);
(where that second parameter is just used for statistics - it updates the 
"cancelled IO" byte-counts if CONFIG_TASK_IO_ACCOUNTING is set - so the 
number doesn't really matter, you could make it zero if you never want the 
thing to show up in the IO accounting).
