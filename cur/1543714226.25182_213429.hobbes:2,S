Natalie,

I agree with your description of why the 15->13 override fails.

These two also create an actual and potential duplicate mp_irqs[] entry.

The ES7000 sure is a great tester of the over-ride code!
But I don't like the proposal to selectively invalidate
existing mp_irqs[] entries.
I think the proper fix is to parse the over-ride entries before
filling in the (remaining) identity mappings.  This also gets
rid of the special case for IRQ2, which would be handled exactly
like the mappings to < 16 on the ES7000 above.
Perhaps I should send you a patch you can test on the ES7000,
since I don't have one of those?
In any case, I'd prefer that proposed patches to this code come
through me, since it is ACPI specific.
thanks,
-Len
