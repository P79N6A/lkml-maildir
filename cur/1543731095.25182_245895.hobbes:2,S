Hi there,
i have an HPT372A (rev 02) (PCI_DEVICE_ID_TTI_HPT372) and since 2.6.8
i've got an Ooooops.
I saw that hpt366.c got support for HPT372_N_ and its special timings, but
that timings have been used for my HPT372_A_ and caused the Oops.
I did the following and now it works:

-------------------------------------------
Not to also check dev->device for the N-Version at that two places
(which are used also for other versions) seems to be wrong.
