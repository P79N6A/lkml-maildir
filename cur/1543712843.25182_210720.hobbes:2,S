If the 1st one is needed, I want to know about it.
The 2nd and 3rd have been in for a long time.

This is Andrew's PIC-fallback patch.  This is probably
the most effective and well written patch that I've
refused to integrate;-)  There are two reasons.
1. it works for some systems, but breaks others.
2. when it works, it hides a failure.  Windows doesn't
have that failure.  We'd rather see the failure, fix it
and have Linux work as well as Windows.
BTW. SuSE picked up this patch in SL9.0, though I don't
know if they still use it.

This has been in the base for about 5 months.  But
Luming Yu found a better way to handle this issue and
his patch was integrated into 2.4 and 2.6 in the
last week:
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1590
We'll probably delete the original retry code
in an upcoming cleanup.

This patch by Jun Nakajima was pulled into the base
about 5 months ago.  It was key to getting VIA systems
to work.
