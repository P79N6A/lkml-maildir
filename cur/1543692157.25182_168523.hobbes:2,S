I just installed a 2.4.22 on my Libranet 2.8 system and find the 
following in dmesg:
---
usb.c: registered new driver usbdevfs
usb.c: registered new driver hub
host/usb-uhci.c: $Revision: 1.275 $ time 10:48:58 Sep 25 2003
host/usb-uhci.c: High bandwidth mode enabled
host/usb-uhci.c: v1.275:USB Universal Host Controller Interface driver
host/usb-ohci.c: USB OHCI at membase 0xca826000, IRQ -19
host/usb-ohci.c: usb-00:0e.2, Compaq Computer Corporation ZFMicro
Chipset USB
usb.c: new USB bus registered, assigned bus number 1
host/usb-ohci.c: request interrupt -19 failed
usb.c: USB bus 1 deregistered

The kernel was compiled, apparently without problem, with the standard 
Libranet 2.8 configuration which includes almost everything as modules. 
The "stock" 2.4.20 kernel does not have the last two lines in dmesg and 
USB works.  This on a Compaq Armada 7800, 266mhz, 180mb.  Other LN2.8 
users report no problems on non-Compaq systems.
