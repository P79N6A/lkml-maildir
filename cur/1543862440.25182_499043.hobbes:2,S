Some hints:
mount(1899): WRITE block 16424 on md3
call md_write_start
md3_raid1(438): WRITE block 40965504 on sdb6
md3_raid1(438): WRITE block 40965504 on sda6
First Write sector 16424 disks 2
Stuck.
Note, that neither end_buffer_async_write() nor
raid1_end_write_request() are invoked, 
In a previous write invoked by:
fsck.ext3(1896): WRITE block 8552 on sdb1
end_buffer_async_write() is invoked.
sdb1 is not a part of a raid device.
Hope that helps,
	tglx
