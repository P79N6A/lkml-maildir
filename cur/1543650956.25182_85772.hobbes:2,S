I am setting up a cache/proxy server for our dial-up and DNA clients. What i
wanna d is to have a transprents cache, wherein i did utilized ipchains and
ip MASQ, and it goes so will if our clients use their connection for http or
www or simply surfing the net. Now my problem is, all our clients passing to
that cache (my RAS is utilizing the cache as its gateway), can't use mIRC,
ICQ, yahoo messenger and other chat client software. Are there any other
alternetive that can be use to solve this problem?
Pls. provide feedback soon, TY.
