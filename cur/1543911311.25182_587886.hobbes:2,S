the RDMA connection id is saved in the skb's priority field for TERM 
messages
because it is not in the CPL message that comes up from the hardware.
Yet the RDMA driver needs it, so sge.c::process_responses() overloads
the skb's priority and csum with these values.

It looks like a bug. Thanks for spotting this.
