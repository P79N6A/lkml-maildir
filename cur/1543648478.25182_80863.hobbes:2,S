Which isn't convincing, either. The benefit of capabilities is to
administer your system _without_ relying on someone else doing a
decent job.

With capabilities you don't have to resort to programming, which _is_
already an easier way to administer. This also means, distribution
builders, who may not be coders, can contribute to enhance security.
Maybe this sounds like a plea for capabilities and maybe it is, but I
just want to put some things straight. Unless there's something
better, I stay with capabilities.
To be more constructive, I want to point to
<
http://www.linux.it/~md/software/ssd.tgz>.
 This is a modified
start-stop-daemon, which allows to change capabilities. With this
really scary, complex user tool (which to some extent it is, when you
look at the code), I was able to drop all the capabilities except for
the ones that are actually needed. ;-)
Regards, Olaf.
