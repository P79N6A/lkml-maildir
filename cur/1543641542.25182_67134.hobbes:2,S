Agreed.  Go for it.
Hm, unless, since 507 vs 256 is not the end of the world and latency is
already low, we want to just make it always (FREE_PTE_NR*PAGE_SIZE)...
As long as the "cond_resched_lock()" is a preempt only thing, I also
agree with making ZAP_BLOCK_SIZE ~0 on !CONFIG_PREEMPT - unless we
wanted to unconditionally drop the locks and let preempt just do the
right thing and also reduce SMP lock contention in the SMP case.
