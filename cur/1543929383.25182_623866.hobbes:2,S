Over on comp.os.linux.development.system someone asked an interesting 
question, and I thought I'd mention it here.
Given a fast low-latency solid state drive, would it ever be beneficial 
to simply wait in the kernel for synchronous read/write calls to 
complete?  The idea is that you could avoid at least two task context 
switches, and if the data access can be completed at less cost than 
those context switches it could be an overall win.
Has anyone played with this concept?
Chris
