This is passed between user space and kernel space right? 
For 32bit emulation on 64bit purposes you should always use explicitely
sized types (u32/u64 not ulong). The pointer will still need to be 
converted. Best is to avoid pointers if possible (e.g. couldn't the data
just be tacked on here?)

If eventry contains any potential 64bit stuff it would be best to align it 
to 64bit explicitely

emulation trap: on x86-64/ia64 u64 have different alignment on 32bit vs
64bit (4 bytes vs natural). Please make sure that u64 is always explicitely
64bit aligned. It isn't here.

Same issue
It would be best to clean the ABI up now when you can still change it.
Otherwise the emulation functions later will be very ugly
(take a look at the LVM horror in arch/x86_64/ia32/ia32_ioctl.c for a 
bad example - LVM1 wasn't cleaned up in time)
