Here is a copy of the bug report that I sent into the Debian project
because of misbehavior of xmms.  I amd forwarding it to linux-kernel
because I didn't notice the problem until after I upgraded from 2.2.16 to
2.4.0-test5.  I am using the stock es1371 module.

Package: xmms
Version: 1.2.2-1
Severity: normal
Although I initially noticed this problem with the helix version, I
installed the current woody version and found the same problem.  I didn't
notice it until after I upgraded to kernel 2.4.0-test5 (from 2.2.16), and
so there may be kernel-related or sound-module-related issues.
Anyway, I can play wav files just fine.  Even the long samples that I can
get to from the sound section of the gnome control panel play perfectly
well.  But xmms, playing an mp3, produces an audible impulse of static
about five times per second or so.  Almost like machine gun fire
superimposed on top of the music.
As you can see from my lsmod output, I am running the es1371 (non-OSS)
sound driver that came with the stock kernel.
