6. Avoid calls to the page allocator
If a subsystem needs 8 pages to do a job, it should only have to call the
allocator once, not 8 times only to spend more time breaking the work up
into page-sized chunks.
If you look at rmqueue_bulk() in the patch, you'll see that it tries to
fill the per-cpu lists of order-0 pages with one call to the allocator
which saved some time. The additional statistics patch shows how many of
these bulk requests are made and what sizes were actually allocated. It
shows that a sizable number of additional calls to the buddy allocator are
avoided.

I will work on this early next week unless someone else does not beat me
to it. Right now, I need to catch a flight and I'll be offline for a few
days.
Once I start, I'm going to be running tests on network filesystems mounted
on the loopback device to see what sort of results I find.

Does it need more documentation? If so, I'll write up a detailed blurb on
how it works and drop it into Documentation/

Unfortunately, it is a fundemental flaw of the buddy allocator that it
fragments badly. The thing is, other allocators that do not fragment are
also slower.

Fingers crossed. I would be very interested to see anything that makes it
simplier.

I tested it with mem=16M (anything lower and my machine doesn't boot the
standard kernel with going OOM, let alone the patched one). There was no
significant change in performance of the aim9 benchmarks. The additional
memory overhead of the patch is insignificant.
However, at low memory, the fragmentation strategy does not work unless
MAX_ORDER is also dropped. As the block reservations are 2^MAX_ORDER in
size, there is no point reserving anything if the system only has 4
MAX_ORDER blocks to being with.
