Works fine for me here on 2.6.16 or 2.6.19 or 2.6.20-rc4
(though I tried with "mail" rather than "rsc" ;)
Whatever, I think it's not a kernel problem: tmpfs itself only handles
numeric gid, I believe it's the job of the userspace end of mount to
convert symbolic uid or gid to numeric uid or gid for the kernel mount.
Looking through what you've tried above, I'm guessing that "rsc" is
your symbolic uid, but you're expecting there to be a group of that
name - perhaps there is not?  perhaps since 2.6.16 you switched from
a distro which makes a group for each user to a distro which does not?
