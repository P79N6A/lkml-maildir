End to end data integrity checking is a requirement.  Otherwise errors
happen silently and you rarely if ever see them.  And the error checking
must be end to end because you cannot trust the other layers to work
properly 100% of the time.
However to actually track down errors to root causes of errors, the closer
you can have your error checking to the hardware the better.  So having
CRC data or similar in the filesystem for both the metadata and the
file information is a good thing.

Error checking should not be necessary for casual files that you don't
really care about but for times when you care about the integrity of
your data the application should be checking it.
