The question seems off-topic on the generic kernel mailinglist then.
freeswan is developed outside the kernel and not part of the kernel, it
has it's own mailinglists (see 
http://www.freeswan.org
).
Netfilter/iptables _is_ part of the kernel but also has it's own
development-oriented mailinglist (netfilter-devel@lists.netfilter.org)
From my (netfilter) point of view:  netfilter and iptables work on both
sparc32 and sparc64.  There's a single known bug in the sparc64 iptables
implementation, but it's only about the per-rule packet and byte counters.

As long as there's nobody pointing me more directly to a particular issue,
no. Sorry.  I don't have the time to test freeswan on a sparc system.
