a couple of percents sounds really really high to me. If it's really
that then I think Andi's conclusion is wrong with respect to that
locking cliff; if we spend a few percent of our performance on locks in
the uncontended case we're way over the edge in my opinion.

page table updates happen in the hypervisor in a xen like
paravirtualized setup right? so that happens outside the kernel..
