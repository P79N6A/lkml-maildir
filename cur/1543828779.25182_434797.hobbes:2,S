No, I don't want a whitelist, as it will be hard to always keep adding
stuff to it (unless we can somehow figure out how to put a "cut-off"
date check in there).  Yes, we do have a number of systems today that
have MSI issues, but the newer ones all work properly, and we should
continue on with the way we have today (blasklist problem boards, as the
rest of the PCI subsystem works with the quirks).
