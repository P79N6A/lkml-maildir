But time_init_hook is supposed to be abused.  That is its purpose - to 
be a hook for different time devices on SGI Visual Workstation and 
Voyager.  And we don't actually abuse it anymore, we just bypass it 
because the default timer init path wants to setup the PIT or the HPET, 
neither of which should be used in paravirt.
