I'm running Linux 2.4.20 with the ac2 patch (I have a couple of Samsung
Harddrives with hangs the unpatched 2.4.20). I am experiecing quite
servere corruption.  The system has IDE-devices. I have only seen the
corruption on some Maxtor drives (but these are the only ones in use).
The same corruption was also noticed with 2.4.20-pre10-ac1.
I noticed a lot of these: 
Dec  8 19:31:54 beige kernel: attempt to access beyond end of device
Dec  8 19:31:54 beige kernel: 3a:07: rw=0, want=1153720904,limit=222859264

Dec  8 19:31:55 beige kernel: attempt to access beyond end of device
Dec  8 19:31:55 beige kernel: 3a:07 rw=0, want=1613332580,limit=222859264
Dec  9 06:28:21 beige kernel: init_special_inode: bogus imod (0)
Dec  9 06:28:21 beige kernel: init_special_inode: bogus imo
If I write ~ 1GB of data and re-read it, it is usually corrupted. 2.4.18
shows no sign of this corruption. 
Attached dmesg should show all relevant hardware.
