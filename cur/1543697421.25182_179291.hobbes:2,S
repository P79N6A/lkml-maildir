well, the probe callback of all ALSA isapnp drivers doesn't look for
the matching device ids.  that is, the callback trusts that the pnp
core passes the correct pnp_card_device_id, and it checks only the
devices listed on this id.  so, as mentioned above, if there are
multiple entries with the same card id but different device ids,
probing the second entry will fail, because match_card() returns the
first matching id.

oh, can pnp_device_id be a card id, too, not only a device id?
