If you have quilt(1) installed and don't mind a couple recompiles, you
can do a bisection on -mm patches:
1) Unpack clean 2.6.14-rc2.
2) Apply attached patch to it ("bisect-mm" script).
3) chmod 755 ./bisect-mm
4) cp -r $WHATEVER/broken-out patches	# copy broken out -mm to the top
					# level directory
"Dumb" mode:
5)	./bisect-mm start
6)	./bisect-mm apply
					# wait until patches are applied
					# or reverted
7)		rebuild
		reboot
8)	./bisect-mm good		# if it boots fine, or
	./bisect-mm bad
		goto 6
Continue until it says "Sucker is ...".
You can also enter "smart" mode after reading comment at the beginning
of the script. It can save your some recompiles.
[PATCH -mm v2] Bisecting through -mm with quilt
Marking patches as good or bad is separated from applying/reverting.
You can edit "series-bisect-mm" manually, then do "./bisect-mm apply"
and it will change tree to the new middle point.
Manual editing boils down to:
			    .--> "good fix-typo.patch"
	"fix-typo.patch" --<
			    `--> "bad fix-typo.patch"
