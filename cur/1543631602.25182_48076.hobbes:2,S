Ok, that's a fine way to think about it. On my architecture, there is no
DMA "mapping" issue, so I'm selfishly thinking about the cache coherency
issue. :o)

So in my case, I have a pool of buffers that are being used to DMA data
to a device. Since I keep these buffers for the life of the driver, I
only want to map at the beginning and unmap at the end. Yet, I have to
change the content of these buffers from the CPU side before DMAing. So,
I do the following process:
1) Allocate the buffers
2) Call pci_map_single() (PCI_DMA_TODEVICE) for all buffers
3) Take a buffer, write into it from CPU
4) Call pci_dma_sync_single() on modified buffer to write back modified
   cache lines
5) Initiate DMA
6) Put the buffer back into the pool
7) goto 3)
I'm developing my driver on MIPS, so I don't have any pci "mapping"
issues, bounce buffers or the like. I know how to maintain cache
coherency throughout this process, but I'm not sure how to write it such
that it fits the PCI-DMA mapping API and will work with other
architectures as well. It'd be nice to solve this now and not deal with
it later. :o)
So, if I'm not mistaken, you are saying that I need to call
pci_dma_sync_single() *after* the DMA so that the CPU reclaims ownership
to the buffer? That's fine and probably serves a good purpose on other
architectures, but wouldn't I also need to do one before the DMA (after
the CPU write) operation to flush write buffers/writeback any cachelines
I've modified for non-cache-coherent architectures? Also, the cache
operations are fairly expensive, and performing another
writeback-invalidate (pci_dma_sync_single()) after the DMA doesn't serve
any purpose on my architecture - so I get a performance penalty for the
sake of compatibility. (Unless I #ifndef it out by architecture.
Ughhhh...)
Thanks,
William
