7 years ago, before cpus_allowed was dreamed up, I proposed a pset patch
and was shot down hard.  Now it's back, and we're trying to find a way to
cram it in on top.
Yeah, it does not fit nicely with cpus_allowed.
I have to ask - do we REALLY need cpusets?  I meant, even SGI dropped
PSET at some point, because (if I recall) NO ONE USED IT.
What's the problem being solved that *requires* psets?
I have a customer I work with periodically who was using my pset patch up
until they moved to RH8, when the O(1) scheduler and cpus_allowed changed
everything.  This was their requirement for pset:
1. Take a processor out of the general execution pool (call it
PROC_RESTRICTED).  This processor will not schedule general tasks.
2. Assign a task to the PROC_RESTRICTED cpu.  Now that CPU will only
schedule the assigned task (and it's children).
3. Repeat for every CPU, with the caveat that one CPU must remain
PROC_ENABLED.
I had an array of enum procstate and a new syscall pair:
sched_{gs}etprocstate().  The scheduler checks the procstate, and if it is
not ENABLED, it checks that (cpus_allowed == 1<<cpu).  Simple, but works.
Could be baked a bit more, for general use.
What if I proposed a patch like this, now?  It would require cleanup for
2.6, but I'm game if it's useful.
