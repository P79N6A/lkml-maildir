hu. where are the days when eth0 was eth0 ...
this means that, when I exchange a network card and replace it with a
new one, it will cost an "ethX" device name each time.
FYI, distribution is latest Gentoo.
as a friend of mine puts it:
    "Haha das is geil, das is wie bei Windows"
    "Wo er merkt, dass du ein neues Mainboard hast :)"
which translates:
    "Haha, that's randy, that's like in Windows, which
    notices that you've got a new mainboard"
Bad, bad Ferdl! How dare you compare this to M$Windows ;-)
well, Michael, thanks for the help,
