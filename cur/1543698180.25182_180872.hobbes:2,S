This particular applet was written by some genius to read a state
from ACPI _every second_.  To add insult to injury it rereads a
constant information from ...battery/info on every round instead of
storing it.  As you can guess it can sink a substantial amount of
cycles and other resources especially that ACPI in BIOS is also
often on a very heavy side.

Likely even every 3 seconds will make a difference but maybe not
enough.
