i believe you're missing the whole point.  Alexey summed it up nicely
earlier.  when you ifconfig an interface the main thing you do is tell
the kernel which set of ip addresses can be reached directly via that
interface.  ie the route is implicit when you configure the interface. 
if you're wanting something different then you either don't understand
and/or you're doing something wrong!
