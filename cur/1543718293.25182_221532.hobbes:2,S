First, I'll point out that this spec, as you noted, is still
a work in progress.
Yes, the rationale is wrong.  Thanks for pointing that out.
I'll get it fixed before we release a spec on this.  We have
a separate agenda item in our size working group to look at
inline expansions (See section 7.9.3 where it lists candidate
projects that are not started yet.) There is already valuable
work going on in the area of inline reduction, but
unfortunately, we don't have anything to contribute to that
discussion yet.
As for the patch, you are correct that the kernel makefile system
supports compilation with -Os, and someone besides us submitted
the patch for that.  However, there is more work needed to
validate that the option doesn't break things, on many different
architectures.
I have reports from the uClinux crowd that use of
the -Os option is fairly typical for users of uClinux, and they
have no reports of breakage.  However, we want to take a methodical
approach to validating that use of this option is fully supported
by the Linux kernel.  Also, we want to test and report the size
and performance effects of the use of the flag.  This work is
not done yet, so the spec. is still under construction.
Just jamming in the compiler option is not really what we intend here.
I'll try to make sure this spec., when released, is worded to
express our requirement that the option be meaningful and safe,
rather than just supported by the build system.
If you see patches from us (or one of our members) related to this spec.,
they will be to fix issues where use of -Os breaks something in the kernel.
Thanks for the feedback.  We'll keep working on this one.
P.S. Why is "Forum" in quotes?
