Thank you.
It says ext2. Based on other messages, I look at /sbin/mkinitrd.
It looks to me that RedHat/Fedora are pretty dumb making stupid 
assumptions about the fs type instead of looking at the filesystem types 
that root has setup in fstab.
I've patched my mkinitrd script to check the fs type of the root 
partition according to /proc/mounts. This should work unless someone is 
overriding mkinitrd to build an initrd for a foreign system or changing 
their root partition. To fix that, I've added an command-line option to 
specify the fs type of the root partition.
Thanks very very much.
Sorry for the error. I assumed too much about RedHat.
Thanks,
David
