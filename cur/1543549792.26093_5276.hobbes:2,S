yep, and there is another problem with pure order-based distinction: if i
do kmalloc(5k), and write the code on Alpha and expect it to never fail,
shouldnt i expect this to never fail on x86 as well? Along with the fork()
failure. __GFP_SOFT solves this all very nicely - the *allocator* decides
what allocation policy to follow. Great!
