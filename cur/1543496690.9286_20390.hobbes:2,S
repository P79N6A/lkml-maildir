i have a supermicro P6DBU motherboard, with an AMI BIOS.
i just installed a new Trident 4D-NX based soundcard, and reset a few
parts of my BIOS' configuration. while i was trying to get things to
run, i set the interrupts for my older ISA (but PnP) soundcard to be
"PCI/PnP" (specifically, interrupts 5 and 15). They had previously
been "ISA/EISA" interrupts.
with this setting, anything that causes a VT-switch will lead to
*no* mouse or keyboard interrupts. Its not quite so simple, since you
also have to do something else first, and I'm not sure what it is. It
might be something related to the PCI soundcard, but this doesn't seem
deterministic.
reverting to ISA/EISA for these interrupts makes things work just
fine.
if anyone has thoughts on why this should be the case, i'd like to
hear it, but i mostly just wanted a data point out there in case
someone else ends up scratching their head over the same issue.
