No. It make _unlike_ "register", direct use of processor registers.
The "register" keyword does _not_ use processor registers. It's just 
syntactic fluff, and tells the compiler exactly one thing:
 - that the compiler should warn if you take the address of such a thing.
In addition, the compiler may generate code that takes it into account, 
which most likely means _worse_ code than if it didn't take it into 
account.
In contrast regparm() actually says something very relevant: it says that 
the function uses a totally different calling convention.
