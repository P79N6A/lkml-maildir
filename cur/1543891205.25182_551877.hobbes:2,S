I'm not an expert, but I think you basically have two options:
 - Turn on CONFIG_FRAME_POINTER
 - Gnaw through the stack trace (from bottom to top), matching up the
   entry points with actual function calls in the assembly.  That way
   you'll see which of the entries are bogus, and which correspond to
   a real call somewhere in the trace.
