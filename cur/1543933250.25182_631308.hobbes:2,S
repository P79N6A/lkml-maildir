I don't agree with you Linus. I'm one of those used to quickly take a
look at its contents when I don't know where all my memory has gone.
I know by experience that if I find 6-digit values in dentry_cache or
inode_cache, all I was looking for is there, and that's enough for a
quick diag. It doesn't give anything accurate, but it's very useful
to quickly diag out some problems on production systems.
It was this week that I noticed for the first time that slabinfo did
not exist anymore, and did not know what replaced it. Lacking time,
I finally gave up and *supposed* that the memory was eaten by the
usual suspects.
I can understand that it has to go away for technical reasons, but Ted
is right, please don't believe that nobody uses it just because you got
no complaint. While people are not likely to perform all computations
in scripts, at least they're used to find some quickly identifiable
patterns there.
