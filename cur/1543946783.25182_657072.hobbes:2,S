Just for fun... this option really has to be renamed:
Memory controller
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
The memory controller is a chip on a computer's motherboard or CPU die
which manages the flow of data going to and from the memory.
Most computers based on an Intel processor have a memory controller
implemented on their motherboard's north bridge, though some modern
microprocessors, such as AMD's Athlon 64 and Opteron processors, IBM's
POWER5, and Sun Microsystems UltraSPARC T1 have a memory controller on
the CPU die to reduce the memory latency.
