No, because the CPL of the task gate would be 0, which means the stack
will be set to tss->esp0.  The DPL of 3 means that the descriptor can be
accessed from CPL3.  The text you mention generally means that the only
way to get back to CPL3 is with iret (via the saved %cs:%eip and
%ss:%esp pushed on the CPL0/1/2 stack).
