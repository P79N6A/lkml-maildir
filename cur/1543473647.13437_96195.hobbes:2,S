Dear IRIS friend,
Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!
IRIS Phone team wishes you all the best during the New 1999 Year! 
We believe you will have a lot of fun using our leading-edge 
Internet voice and video communication system.
For our users, we offer special Christmas sweepstakes giving away 
a lot of FREE stuff including "every Internet phone user must-have" 
color PC video cameras and headsets. We also launched the already 
traditional "order one, get two keys" Christmas promotion. 
Don't wait, visit
