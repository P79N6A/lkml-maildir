Yes, partly i am.
But you are used to paging, you may think it is natural that when you
need real RAM, you have to ask for it. To non Unix programmers, this is
weird. Just like having you application "sleep" with a spin loop, which
is a common programming tecnique in non timesharing systems. 
It is not bad *C language* programming, it's bad *UNIX* programming.
The OS may always signal you that something happened: the user of your
controlling terminal just exited (hangup), your program has been requested
to terminate, we're OOM, etc. That's OS semantic. It's outside the scope 
of the C standard.
You may say the Linux kernel should not kill random process, and i may
agree. Don't say malloc() behaviour is not "standard". The C language
does not say anything about when or why a process should get a signal
by the OS. The C language, BTW, has no notion of what a process is.

Pardon me, a standard either "says" something, or not. You may imply
something while reading it.

That's OS (UNIX) semantic. What exacly SIGBUS, SIGSEGV, and the like
mean is up to the kernel. You should know you may get a signal under
OOM. So, before bug-hunting, just check if the system was OOM.

Why do you call receiving a signal a "program bug"?  A program may receive
SIGHUP, SIGINT, SIGTERM, and many others, under normal (usually external)
conditions. OOM is an "external" condition. You may suggest that we need
a new signal, SIGABOUTTOOOM, but this is OS matter.

you need better support from the OS, then. Adherence to C standard is
another matter.

No problem. Is is problem that your program gets stoppen when it gets
SIGTSTP? If no, you don't have to use any "special programming techniques".
If yes, you may think of trapping the signal and inform the user that
stopping your application is not possible. Are you concerned of your
program being killed at OOM time? Use special techniques to avoid
triggering the OOM killer (i.e., do not page-fault). It's harder
than just using signal(), i admit it. It may also be impossible to do
in a really "safe" way (your stack may grow...). So we need a better
kernel API to handle such cases. Again, not a C standard problem.

IFAIK, older linux versions had no overcommitting. The kernel *evolved*
from a non-overcommitting mm to a overcommitting one.
