Not freeing up the memory until umount is not a bug, it's normal.  The 
(cache) memory is supposed to be freed up when it's needed for something more 
important.
The discussion right now is about whether the mm is supposed to be able to 
handle more than 50% mlocked memory or whether that's a user bug.
(I think we should be able to mlock >90% of memory, but there isn't general 
agreement on this.  The question is not whether it's possible, but whether 
there's a real need for applications to be able to do this.)

Please stay tuned.
