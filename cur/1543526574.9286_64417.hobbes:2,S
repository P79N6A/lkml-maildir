I've seen a simmlar thing:
Connections stall for hours+ if SACK and timestamps are enabled, disabling
them solves the problem. This happens between Linux hosts and random hosts
out on the internet (even ones that are running stock linux kernels).
I thought it was the stupid checkpoint firewall-1 on my end munging it,
but I havn't had a chance to check it occures from outside the firewall.
