That's pretty close to where I think the problem is (the front merging
and cfq_reposition_rq_rb()). The issue with that is that you'd only get
aliases for O_DIRECT and/or raw IO, and that doesn't seem to be the case
here. Given that front merges are equally not very likely, I'd be
surprised is something like that has ever happened.
BUT... That may explain while we are only seeing it on md. Would md
ever be issuing such requests that trigger this condition?
I'll try and concoct a test case.
