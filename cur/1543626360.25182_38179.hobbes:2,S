Hello,
	I was trying to trace the handling of the system calls, and to step through 
the entry.S on i386 machine.  I basically used this:
	srin_entryS_debug_mesg: 		#My addition
		.asciz "some relevant message\n"
		ALIGN
	tracesys:			#haven't changed anything here..
		.
		.
		.
		jae tracesys_exit
		pushl $srin_entryS_debug_mesg		#just this
		call SYMBOL_NAME(printk)	# and this
		call *SYMBOL_NAME(sys_call_table)(,%eax,4)
		movl %eax,EAX(%esp)		# save the return value
	tracesys_exit:
Shouldn't this call printk everytime a system call is made or atleast crash 
the kernel if something is dead wrong ? ( It isn't .. everything seems normal 
as though the printk isn't there )  Also,  how can  i know the values in the 
specific registers in that file ? Specifically, whenever a system call is 
made, what registers store what values ? I'm using kernel 2.4.7 on a K6-2.
