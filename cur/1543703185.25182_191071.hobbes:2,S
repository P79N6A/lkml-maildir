If the card isn't even brought up it means that you're lacking power
management completely for that device.
I'm using pmdisk, perhaps swsusp is using different calls to device drivers,
and no one has ever written them for sis900.
I searched documentation on swsusp interface, but found nothing,
as a matter of fact I assumed that what's in Documentation/power would
apply to both pmdisk and swsusp, since they're similar implementations.
Check that the patch at:
http://teg.homeunix.org/kernel_patches.html
 is in your tree.
If you have time try to match my configuration (2.6.1, pmdisk and sis900
compiled in) and see if that way it works.
Bye
