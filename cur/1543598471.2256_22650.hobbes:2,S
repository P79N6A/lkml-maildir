I have several entries more in my logfile. It would be no problem collecting 
them if that is helpful. I forgot to say that I'm using an IBM 41 GB (hda: 
IBM-DTLA-305040, ATA DISK drive) and that this problem only occurs on my 
root-partition (hda5), the always mounted /boot-Partition (hda1) and partially 
mounted misc-Partition (hda7) are not effected.
I don't use any NFS.
