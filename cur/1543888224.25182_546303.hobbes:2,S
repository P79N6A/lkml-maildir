The glitch1 script has been vastly updated, and now runs by itself after 
being started. It produces files with the fps from glxgears and a 
"fairloops" file which indicates the number of loops for each of the 
scrolling xterms. This gives a good indication of fairness, all 
processes should have about the same number of loops.
Testing 2.6.21.1-cfs-v13:
Using all default settings, all four processes ran the same number of 
loops over 40sec within about 8%. I'll have some neat results with 
standard deviation by the end of the weekend, it's supposed to rain. 
Visual inspection of the glxgears while running looked smooth as a 
baby's ass.
Current self-running script attached, I'm writing a doc, hopefully if 
you want to tune it the comments are clear.
*Note*: these values make sense when various schedulers and tuning 
values are run on the same machine. So I'll be testing on three 
machines, with dual-core, hyperthreaded uni, and pure uni. Unless I see 
a hint that one of these cases is handled less well than the others I 
won't compare.
