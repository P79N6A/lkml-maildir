Subject: [GIT PATCH] PCI and PCI hotplug fixes for 2.6.19-rc3
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Here are some PCI and PCI hotplug patches for 2.6.19-rc3.
Most of these patches have been in the -mm tree for a bit.  The
exception was the PCI Hotplug fix, and the "fix sparc64" patch.  Both of
them have been acked by the respective maintainer in the area that they
affect.
Please pull from:
	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/pci-2.6.git/
or if master.kernel.org hasn't synced up yet:
	master.kernel.org:/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/pci-2.6.git/
The full patches will be sent to the linux-pci mailing list, if anyone
wants to see them.
thanks,
greg k-h
