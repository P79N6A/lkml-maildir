     i feel like the media isn`t downgrading because
 the badblocks _arent_ physical: low-level drive
 reformat doesnt show anything.
     how i think it may be related to chipset/controller?
 when data is transferred in udma mode, there may be
 checksumming errors, and the wrong crc is being wrote
 to the disk.
     so when data is being accessed, bah - you are in
 shit...
 although, this is only a theory...
