That doesn't really mean anything, just that the PCI endpoint doesn't
announce its capability to do MSI in the config space, or that it
does not have an interrupt line. Since you basically implement the
device on the FSL board, you should also be able to define the interrupt
capabilities by writing to the config space.
Do you know what kind of chipset the host uses? It should be fairly
simple to find out whether or not it can do MSI.
