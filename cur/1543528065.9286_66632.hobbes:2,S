When did acpid start doing useful stuff?  When I tried it, around 2.3.40
time, the only notable effects where that enabling ACPI in the kernel
prevented apmd from correcting the time after a suspend, and acpid
prevented my laptop from suspending at all.
Until that's changed, only APM is useful for me.
