Thank you very much for the pointers. I had just reached the 
same conclusion this afternoon, when pissed off by finding the 
CPU was at 85 C despite the fans being on at the max I did 
exactly what you suggest; although I didn't find any dust 
bunny, a thorough cleanup and blowing plus some toothpicking of 
hair and whatnot, I find myself with a computer that is running 
finely --again :)
Too bad, I'll need another excuse to buy myself the new hard disk ...
What about the sensors?
