I think tpm_tis should do something like the patch below to discover
its interrupt.  If ACPI tells us the device's IRQ, we should just use
it rather than blindly trying a few possibilities.  So the patch below
might make it work, because it should skip the problematic code you
identified above.
But there could still be an issue with DEBUG_SHIRQ and the IRQ probe
loop.  Even if we used the attached patch, we'd probably still want
the IRQ probe to work when you specify tpm_tis.force=1.
