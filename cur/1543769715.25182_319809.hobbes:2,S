9 point releases is nowhere long enough. This removal needs to wait for
similar amounts of time as other removed interfaces (c.f. devfs, which
is far more offensive).
In general there are staging rules for this sort of affair, and although
I'm no expert in their fine points, nor can I even say what the exact
criteria are, but it's rather clear in this instance it's over the line.
I suspect a major release, planned as a staging ground for things like
e.g. this and removing devfs, would be the most appropriate time for it.
