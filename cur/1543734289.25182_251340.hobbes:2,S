Besides the low-security and high-security choices,
I'd like to see a medium-security choice.
low: everybody sees everything
medium: everybody sees something; privileged user sees all
high: must be privileged
This might mean that asking for stuff like EIP and WCHAN
causes you to see fewer processes.
If partial info is returned for a process, I'd like to
also get a bitmap of valid fields. Special "not valid"
values are a pain to deal with.
