Subject: Possible downside to recent OOM killer change?

The OOM killer in 2.4.18 (Red Hat 8.0) appears to have two problems in my testing:
1. it picks the wrong process at first
2. after killing the memory hog, it sometimes
then goes and kills one more process.  This might
be an unexpected side effect of Rik's recent change
Details:
I'm working to tighten up my apps so I can use strict overcommit
(see 
http://www.kegel.com/stackcheck/
 for my notes) but
still feel the need for the OOM killer as a safety net.
I ran a test app (
http://kegel.com/stackcheck/harsh.cc
)
to malloc and touch 45 megabytes of RAM on a Red Hat 8.0
box with no swap and 64 MB RAM.  The OOM killer killed
several wrong processes before stumbling on the right one.
So I applied an oom killer patch that gives extra badness
to processes whose RSS is above one quarter of RLIMIT_RSS
(yes, it's a horrible kludge, and it only works if you
set RLIMIT_RSS to above the amount of physical memory;
patch at 
http://kegel.com/stackcheck/oom-dank2.patch
).
This got the OOM killer to reliably kill the correct process first
in all cases I tested.  I would prefer some less hacky
way of getting the oom killer to pick the right process,
but this is ok for the moment, as it gets me to the next
problem.
When I log in to my test box via ssh, and run the following script:
  #!/bin/sh
  /sbin/swapoff -a
  # mark the process to be preferentially killed when OOM if RSS > 16MB
  ulimit -m 64000
  # create 50 threads, each mallocing 1MB, each with 100KB threadstack
  ./harsh 469 1 1 100 100 1024000
sometimes the OOM killer kills all the threads of the memory hog in one pass;
sometimes it kills some of its threads in a first pass, and
kills the rest in a second pass about five seconds later;
and sometimes it will do a third pass and kill some innocent process.
(Since the process is madly spawning threads, it's not suprising
the OOM killer doesn't get them all in one pass.)
I've enabled DEBUG in oom_kill.c, and am watching the badness values
it prints out.  In the latter case, where it kills an extra process,
the memory hog doesn't appear in the list of badness scores, possibly
because I've applied Rik's little patch from a few days ago that
skips processes with PF_MEMDIE.  My thinking is, if the threads
have not yet died for some reason, the oom killer has no choice
but to look for another victim.  Without Rik's change, the
system would have kept trying to kill the hog forever.
Maybe some revision is needed?
For what it's worth, here are the from dmesg showing the
last three passes of the OOM killer from one run.  The
last pass killed an innocent sshd.
