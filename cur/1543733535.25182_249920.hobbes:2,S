I've got a Compaq ProLiant ML 370, and somewhere along the way, I seem
to have lost the tools to manage the array controller.
If anyone can point me to a web page/email address/irc channel/etc where I can
get some pointers on how to get access to the array configuration
utilities, I would appreciate it.
I'm cc:ing cpqarray-discuss@lists.sourceforge.net, but I don't honestly
know if that list is even still in existence.
