Thanks Greg. I'll check out the doc. I do remember posting the LSM mailing
list about kernel hooks, but as I recall there was no response. I assumed
that the hooking mechanism was not the focus of attention - that was
18months ago. A few weeks ago Suparna told me LSM had been enquiring about
kernel hooks - never heard the outcome though.
