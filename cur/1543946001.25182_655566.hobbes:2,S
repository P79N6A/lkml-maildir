Using working barriers is important for normal users when you really 
care about data loss and have normal drives in a box. We do power fail 
testing on boxes (with reiserfs and ext3) and can definitely see a lot 
of file system corruption eliminated over power failures when barriers 
are enabled properly.
It is not unreasonable for some machines to disable barriers to get a 
performance boost, but I would not do that when you are storing things 
you really need back.
Of course, you don't need barriers when you either disable the write 
cache on the drives or use a battery backed RAID array which gives you a 
write cache that will survive power outages...
