Hi Linda,
 I'm a bit unclear as to what your end-goal is here. Is it basically to
ensure that fstat() always return the correct value for the mtime?
 The reason I ask is that I think your change is likely to have nasty
consequences for the general performance in a lot of other syscalls that
use nfs_revalidate_inode(). I would expect a particularly nasty hit in
the of the write() syscalls themselves, and they really shouldn't have
to worry about the value of mtime in the close-to-open cache consistency
model.
I therefore think we should look for a more fine-grained solution that
addresses more precisely the issues you see.
Cheers,
  Trond
