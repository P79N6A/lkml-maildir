Yeah I originally had that in mind but did not write it out ;)
What would the struct look like? Because if the following was true, then you
could also use a pointer:
int my_printf(const char *fmt, struct { some ints, some char's, whatever } arg)
{
    struct giveItAName *ap = &arg;
    callanotherfunc(fmt, ap);
    callanotherfunc(fmt, ap);
}
>In the latter case, you obviously can't do va_list dest = src and
Mmh, I could, because GCC is wise enough to copy whole structs. This is BTW
done a LOT in the kernel sources. Just compile it with -Waggreagte-return and
ye'll get a whole whopping lot of warnings from GCC. For
linux-2.[46].\d+.tar.bz2.

Who said the struct is changed? The compiler could use some magic to copy
above-metioned "arg" to a temporary which is only valid during my_printf() and
callees.
Who says the struct has to be changed? And even if it was about to, you could
copy it.
>(as it depends on where exactly the called function stopped with va_arg).
Don't get me wrong, I'm just asking... in a pessimistic fashion.
