Can you tell us what controller chipset you have (output of lspci should
be fine) and if your hard drive has DMA or uDMA enabled?
There have been a few other reports of oopsen and fs corruption during
periods of high interrupt activity. Mine seems to occur whenever I
saturate my local network with traffic to/from the machine, but it is fine
if I turn DMA off (using hdparm -d0 /dev/hda)
