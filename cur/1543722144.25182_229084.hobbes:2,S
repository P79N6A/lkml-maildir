Hi,
I am testing 2.6.7-bk4 + timer fix + vesafb-tng patch. This time without 
debuging compiled in. Everything worked perfectly before I got:
bad: scheduling while atomic!

Kernel panic: Aiee, killing interrupt handler!
In interrupt handler - not syncing
(sorry for any mistakes - I copied it by hand).
The kernel was not tainted. I can reproduce the same every time I want to 
connect to the network. I use speedtouch kernel driver. I have script that 
first executes modem_run then pppd then wget to change DNS entries to new 
IP adress. This happens after pppd setups connection and gets IP. I think 
that this happens in wget. This works with 2.6.7, so some recent bk change 
is probably the cause.
Can you help me?
Thanks,
Grzegorz Kulewski
