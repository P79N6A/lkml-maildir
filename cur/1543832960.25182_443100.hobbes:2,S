That won't happen. If fbdev unloads, then the module that does the
notification disappears, and the clients won't receive notifications.
If the client is the one that unloads first, it unregisters its notifier
block, and that's one less client for fbdev to notify (And fbdev doesn't
know how many clients are there, that's internal to the notifier). And
since registration, unregistration and the call to the callout function
in the notifier block are protected by a semaphore (in the blocking type),
the danger of unregistration while in the midst of a notification is
removed.
