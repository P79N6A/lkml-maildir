Hi, Willian.
First of all, thank you very much for both your attention and help.
Unfortunately, I have already tried booting the 2.6.11-rc3-mm2 that I just
compiled and I tried using many boot parameters like "acpi=noirq",
"irqpoll", "pci=noacpi", "acpi=off" and setting the BIOS of my motherboard
to "Plug'n'Play OS = Yes" (instead of "Off", which is my default).
To prevent the matters of loosing track of what is being done, I only
changed one option at a time. I put the dmesg logs of all my attempts at
<
http://www.ime.usp.br/~rbrito/ide-problem/>.
Please let me know if I can provide any other useful information.
Thank you very much again for any help, Rogério.
