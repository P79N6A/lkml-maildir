Note that you slightly change the debug trace when doing this. For
example, the case where udv != NULL and !udv->streaming would display
the debug line before your patch, and no more after.
Now I don't know whether that change is a problem or not in this
particular case, as I am not the one who would debug this driver if
there were a problem with it, but this is something to pay attention to
in such cases.
Thanks,
