Well, probably I shouldn't care about it at all. The setup-bus.c could
be considered as PCI-to-PCI bridge driver which deals _only_ with
certain type of devices with fixed resource layout. If you can
make your host bridge look like this, fine. You'll be able to use some
nice tricks like reallocating host bridge resources.
If not, it's your problem. But you're still able to use routines from
setup-bus.c for any bus behind the PCI-PCI bridges.

Ok, ok, I give up. :-)

True. Probably it's ok for 2.4, but it would be better to have something
sane for 2.5. We have already agreed that 4 is not much better than 3.
A single resource pointer and resource count fields would fork fine for
PCI and CardBus bridges, but will break most platforms where root bus
resources are randomly allocated structures.
I tend to agree about #define.
