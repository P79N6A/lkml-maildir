Thanks.
I noticed that there still existed a high risk of overflow with HZ values
for which (HZ % 1000) != 0 && (1000 % HZ) != 0, because we hit the only
situation where we start with a multiply by HZ, which is even worse as HZ
grows. The only cases I've found are :
  - alpha : 1024 or 1200
  - ia64  : 1024
Fortunately, they're both 64 bits, and since the result is an unsigned long,
the multiply returns 64 bits result so it won't overflow in a while. However,
we should avoid those combinations on 32-bits archs, because the limit is
then rather low. For example, using HZ=1200 on an x86 will set MAX_MSEC_OFFSET
to 3579138 ms, which is just below one hour. For reference, with HZ=1000,
MAX_MSEC_OFFSET would be 2^32-1 ms, or 49.7 days, which makes quite a
difference.
It is possible that some self-made setups hit the overflow before the patch.
For this reason, I wonder how we could discourage people from using such
bastard HZ values on 32 bits platforms :-/

Willy
