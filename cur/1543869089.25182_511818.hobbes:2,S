the syslet/threadlet framework has been derived from Tux, which one can 
accuse of may things, but which i definitely can not accuse of being 
slow. It has no relationship whatsoever to Solaris 2.0 or later.
Your other mail showed that you have very basic misunderstandings about 
how threadlets work, on which you based a string of firm but incorrect 
conclusions. In this discussion i'm mostly interested in specific 
feedback about syslets/threadlets - thankfully we are past the years of 
"unless Linux does generic technique X it will stay a hobby OS forever" 
type of time-wasting discussions.
