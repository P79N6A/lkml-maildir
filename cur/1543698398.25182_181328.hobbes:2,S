I'm not sure what is the exact state of the 8xx support in the main
tree, but for embedded ppc related question, you should ask on the
linuxppc-embedded list (lists.linuxppc.org). You may also have more
luck using the "linuxppc-2.5" tree on source.mvista.com for such
things (or my linuxppc-2.5-benh for powermac related stuffs).
