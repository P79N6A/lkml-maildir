Yep

The PCMCIA code last time I checked was still calling network device driver
admin routines from an interrupt. If that hasnt been fixed in pcmcia-cs
that would explain these kind of behaviours

If PCMCIA managed to remove a module for an active interface then it is
broken. Fix the MOD_INC/DEC_USE_COUNT stuff for that module. An interface
that is up is always 'in use'.
