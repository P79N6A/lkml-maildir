We went to do a PCI configuration cycle and your box blew up. Thats
pretty clear. Could be down to the various changes in how we do PCI
accesses tripping up a problem box, or triggering a bug.
See what effect 
	pci=bios
	pci=conf1
	pci=conf2
	pci=nommconf
	pci=nomsi
have and report back.
What drivers do you have enabled and what pci devices are present ?
