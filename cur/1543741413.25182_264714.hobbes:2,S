I'd say go with the name change. "protection" is fairly vague...
OTOH, lowmem_reserve doesn't quite carry the meaning that it is
_protecting_ lower zones from higher zone allocations... maybe
lowmem_protection? But I don't mind too much.
I see classzone_idx snuck in, can we leave that as alloc_type please?
Otherwise, looks great.
