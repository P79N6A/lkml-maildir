[PATCH] I2C: Discard out-of-date comment in adm1021 driver
This simple patch discards an out-of-date comment in the adm1021 driver.
I've done the same in our CVS repository where many more drivers were
affected.
I agree it's not very important, but I prefer it to be done before any
driver with the error is used as a base to port a new driver, and the
misinformation spreads.
