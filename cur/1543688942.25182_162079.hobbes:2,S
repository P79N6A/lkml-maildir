latest version of typos.base contains 94 unique typos
(around 560, counting repetitions)
Generated diff available, against kernel 2.4.22 final : 
http://www.leroutier.net/typos.diff.bz2
most part of changes are in comments, or in documentation but there are
some in code (incomming => incoming in bluetooth,X25 and interupt->
interrupt in ppc64,ipmi)
this diff contains 2 manually edited changes :
1) addresses => adresses : (in fact, revert to 2.4.22 code) : it is a comment
in french
2) errorr => error : i'll have to refine my script to deal with that one
That's all for now.
If you want one for 2.6, do it yourself using my script because i'm on a slow
link here (56Kb/s) and i don't have a recent dev-source actually here.
