About Standard aliases:
> modprobe -c
...
alias ppp-compress-21 bsd_comp
...
Why bsd_comp is the standard alias?
/src/linux/Configure.help says that
The PPP Deflate compression method ("PPP Deflate compression",
  above) is preferable to BSD-Compress, because it compresses better
  and is patent-free.
