those 12 more bytes payoff providing better swapping performance, handle
mremap transparently and make the code scale better, allowing even to
_trivially_ move the page_table_lock into the vma without any downside
(I mean performance downside, per-vma lock will cost one more bit of
info in every vma).
There's no way to remove those 12 bytes without falling in the downsides
of anonmm.
I don't see a real need to shrink the size of the prio_tree right now
though if something useless and can be removed that's fine with me, what
I'm trying to tell is that pointing the finger at 12 bytes of anon_vma
doesn't sound a good argument since there's no way to remove them
without falling back in the anonmm downsides.
