If you are going to change the interface then don't call it kallsyms.
kallsyms and that interface were designed to kernel debugging in
general and kdb in particular.  I need all the fields for decent
debugging and I refuse to allow my kallsyms code to be appropiated for
somebody else's usage if it stops kdb from working!
