yep, the get_swap_page() latency. I can easily trigger 10+ msec
latencies on a box with alot of swap by just letting stuff swap out. I
had a quick look but there was no obvious way to break the lock. Maybe
Andrew has better ideas? get_swap_page() is pretty stupid, it does a
near linear search for a free slot in the swap bitmap - this not only is
a latency issue but also an overhead thing as we do it for every other
page that touches swap.
rationale: this is pretty much the only latency that we still having
during heavy VM load and it would Just Be Cool if we fixed this final
one. audio daemons and apps like jackd use mlockall() so they are not
affected by swapping.
