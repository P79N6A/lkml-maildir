I tried with 2.6.17.1, but the problem remains (I use original cdrecord)
Since I have a relatively old glibc I cannot use the newer versions of
cdrecord-prodvd, but cdrecord-prodvd-2.01b31-i686-pc-linux-gnu sometimes
works. I did work sometimes, but even when it wors and prints the atip -
compared to using my dvd-recorder it takes ages to print the results.
But now that I tried to double-check, it hung as well. It printed one
additional line after the supported modes, namely:
Drive buf size : 1806336 = 1764 KB
But then hangs. (full output see below)

That did not make a difference either, apart from the slightly different
warning message at the beginning.
