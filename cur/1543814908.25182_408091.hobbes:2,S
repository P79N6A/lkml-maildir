Hello.
When grabbing composite video with Iomega Buz, the stock driver will prevent grabbing from the same input twice in a row, forcing the user to switch inputs before anything useful can be grabbed again. It is caused by some optimization code in the input selection parts, and triggered by the saa7111_command() executing cmd 0. The attached patch will remedy this by disabling cmd 0 altogether; a fix that has no found negative effects on the rest of the code. In fact, saa7110.c does the exact same thing.
It would be nice to have this included in the kernel driver.
I'd appreciate being kept in the recipient list in case of discussion.
Regards,
/Sam
