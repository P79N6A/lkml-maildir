Trying to think of something you have never seen is like trying to think
of a new color. I can not think of a case where the current default
behaviour is better (you can define that as your will, in terms of either
functionality or convenience).

Good buzz words, your mailer dropped the URL of the document with the

call for changes). If you want people to stop asking for patches help them
do what they need to do.
