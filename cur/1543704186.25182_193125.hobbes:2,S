Just to clarify, are you talking about vesafb? I ask, because the
rage128 driver included in the kernel does not support flat panels.
That's the reason why I started a new driver for my Dell C600, which I
haven't ported to 2.6 yet (volunteers are welcome, see
http://www.saftware.de/r128fb/r128fb-20030819.tar.bz2
 ;-).
