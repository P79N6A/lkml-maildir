I have an old IBM Aptiva 486 SX that actually DOES something like this; what
it does is, it suspends to disk when you hit the power button (you have to
turn that option on though).
I once actually had a situation where a badly behaved application prevented
this suspend-to-disk, and I had to pull the plug.
Point being, if it was possible back then (6 years ago), why on earth would
it be too expensive now?
