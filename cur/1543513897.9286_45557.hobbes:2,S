Thanks.  I figured out how to load the modules and the parameters I needed
for the card.  I did notice (I was using isapnp to configure the card, and
decided to let the bios take care of it, works just the same) when I had the
dma and dma16 to 1 and 5, it complained when loading (mad16.o).  Looking at
the source it looks like it doesn't like this way and wants it dma=1 and
dma16=0 (I forgot the other 2 or 3 combinations).
Anyway, if it wasn't such a crappy card (it's in a laptop.  I've used linux
on 2 laptops with sound cards and have had bad experiences with the HW. 
drivers work just fine) it wouldn't be so bad <g>
