Currently it can't - hlist either prefetches to zero or to a valid 
address and everybody else using prefetch should also use valid addresses.
But it's conceivable that future kernels make more extensive use of
prefetch.
e.g. x86-64 hit it because it has prefetch is copy_{from/to}_user /csum_copy_*
and everybody can pass arbitary addresses to that.
