Well said. :)
The original report had stated that a recent version of binutils was used,
so I didn't question it and just went into "Doh, quickfix" mode. I was 
soon notified that it really had been compiled with an older 2.8, which
makes perfect sense in hindsight (because of the nature of the messages).
Such is the case when a huge chunk of patch is accepted into the mainline:
you seem to get very antsy and ready to jump at any little problem with
it. :)
