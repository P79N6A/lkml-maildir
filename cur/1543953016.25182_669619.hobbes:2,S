Hm.  I think the problem was that the patch changed the ordering so that 
the %ebp fault test was happening with interrupts disabled, meaning that 
any fault-in would happen with interrupts disabled.
Could you tell me if this revised patch still provokes a problem?
Thanks,

Subject: x86: only enable interrupts when kernel state has been set up
The sysenter path tries to enable interrupts immediately.  Unfortunately
this doesn't work in a paravirt environment, because not enough kernel
state has been set up at that point (namely, pointing %fs to the kernel
percpu data segment).  To fix this, defer ENABLE_INTERRUPTS until after
the kernel state has been set up.
Unfortunately this means that we're running with interrupts disabled
for a while without calling the IRQ tracing code, but that can't be
called without setting up %fs either.
