This probably doesn't matter much, every application can handle only
the subset it is interested in. For example a dockapp displaying the
system temperature only cares about the temp* files and ignores the
in*, fan*, etc. files.
However, it would be convenient if the battery monitoring application
had an easy (and non heuristic-based) way to distinguish between a
battery and a hardware monitoring chip. In that sense, having a
separate class makes sense. This doesn't prevent the battery drivers to
use the same conventions used by the hardware monitoring drivers.

Nice to read this for a change, usually people have only complaints
about it ;)

I guess we never felt any need for an "infrastructure", else we would
have created it. I have no idea what the "input infrastructure" looks
like so I can't compare. If you have something to propose which would
refactor some code amongst the hardware monitoring drivers or would
otherwise makes thing better, speak up :)
Note that the hwmon class is merely a way to find out which devices
have hardware monitoring attributes. There are no class attributes in
use. The reason is historical, and also due to the fact that no two
hardware monitoring chips have the same set of features.
