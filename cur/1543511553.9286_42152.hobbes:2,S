It's the block number, not the sector number. The block numbers are
of course stored somewhere in the filesystem. For example in an
inode block (the quick access first few blocks) or an indirect 
block. 
Still: Possible causes are abundant.
	DMA into the wrong place (either overwriting the info we had
	  cached or not overwriting what was in the intended buffer 
	  before)
	Bit errors in memory. Pointer to data falls over. This should
	  normally be accompanied by Oopsen, and sig11's during kernel
	  compilation.
	Bit errors while transferring data from disk. This time a bit
	  pointing to an indirect block must've been changed, leading
	  to the wrong block getting accessed as the indirect block. 
	Driver bug, scribbling random memory. Again I'd expect more 
	  Oopsen. Hmm. If the bug is to use memory that has just been 
	  freed, the bug will always have a valid pointer , previnting
	  the oops... Hmm. 
Roger.
