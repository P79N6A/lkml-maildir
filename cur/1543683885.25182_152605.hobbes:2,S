Hi,
Just want to confirm that problem described by Sander
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=105935020525253
persist on my system since test1-bk2 version as well. And it reveals
itself usually under some specific load of hdd I/O - in my case
usually it is running 'dselect' or 'dpkg -i' with an attempt to install/remove
packages. Then software says something about error in some data file and
syslog bears the signs of errors:
Buffer I/O error on device hda2, logical block 3861502
Buffer I/O error on device hda2, logical block 3861504
Buffer I/O error on device hda2, logical block 3861506
My system is laptop vaio PCG-P505TS running Debian unstable
Linux kernel 2.6.0-test2
I provide links (to don't thrust the mailing list) to my 
.config: 
http://www.onerussian.com/linux.bug/config-2.6.0-test2
dmesg:
http://www.onerussian.com/linux.bug/dmesg.log
dmesg bears also signs about 
buffer layer error at fs/buffer.c:416
Call Trace:
 [<c0154f30>] __find_get_block_slow+0x80/0xe0
 [<c0155f51>] __find_get_block+0x91/0xf0
which I've not mentioned before so I don't know if they are relevant to
the problem
Thanx for your help/support
                                  .-.
