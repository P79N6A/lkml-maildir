Made me curious and looking around on what the warning is coming ? Few 
basic questions ..
Do you have CONFIG_LBD ?
I see the ext3_getblk() used "long" for "block" & 
ext3_get_blocks_handle() expects "sector_t"
for "block". Wondering if you are running into 64-bit -to- 32-bit 
conversion issues .. ?
Thanks,
Badari
