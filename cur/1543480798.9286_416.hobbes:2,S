Hello,
	2.2.0-pre8 built with egcs-1.1.1 booting on AlphaStation 200 4/233
configured for Avanti w/SRM and TGA framebuffer.  Displays tux in upper
right corner, shows kernel version, detects 1 scsi host (ncr53c810) and
then stalls.  Keyboard LED's work and I can CTRL-ALT-DEL (though it results
in little more than a machine check vector 660).
cheers,
-bp
