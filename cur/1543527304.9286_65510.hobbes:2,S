/usr/src/linux/include/linux/fs.h: In function `locks_verify_truncate':
/usr/src/linux/include/linux/fs.h:769: warning: implicit declaration of
function `abs'
Are we missing an <linux/stdlib.h> ? and <linux/stdio.h> ?
Or how should it be fixed?
I'm sure I can find other functions that are never defined, if I put some
time in it.
