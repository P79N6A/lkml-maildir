I started this once.
I have (sort of) a GIT tree with all Linux revisions that I could find 
from v0.01 up to v1.0.9.  But the most interesting information and also 
what is the most time consuming is the retrieval of announcement 
messages for those releases in old mailing list or newsgroup archives to 
serve as commit log data.  It seems to be even arder to find for post 
v1.0 releases.
