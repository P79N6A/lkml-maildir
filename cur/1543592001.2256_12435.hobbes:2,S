A better habit is encapsulating your data structures well enough that the
entire kernel doesn't feel the need to go digging through them. The fact
that you have to change many widely-scattered instances of something
points to bad modularity. Supporting that practice with verbose naming is
not doing yourself a favor in the long run.
If you must, use accessor functions instead. At best you'll be able to
make sweeping semantic changes in one spot. At worst, you'll be able to
grep for it.
