Only a hand written proto-patch. Below is a real (but untested) one.
Note that there might be still issues when called from get_user_pages()
which of course won't go back to userland. For the two usage scenario I
have in mind, it should be ok though. One (a signal pending) will loop
back in until the resource is available, the other (no_page() inserts
the PTE itself) is just fine. For the former case, I've added a
cond_resched() to the loop, we might want to look into adding the info
of wether we are coming from get_user_pages() vs. do_page_fault() to
these new arguments you want to add to page fault handlers. That would
allow in our case to do a non-interruptibe sleep when caused by
get_user_pages().
---
Add a way for a no_page() handler to request a retry of the faulting
instruction. It goes back to userland on page faults and just tries
again in get_user_pages(). I added a cond_resched() in the loop in that
later case.
