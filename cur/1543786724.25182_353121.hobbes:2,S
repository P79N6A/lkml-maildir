Just a question here, maybe it's dumb.
* and / have the same priority in the order of operations, yes? If so,
won't the the 1000 * MAX_SCHEDULE_TIMEOUT overflow
(MAX_SCHEDULE_TIMEOUT is LONG_MAX)? I really think this code just move
to the same thing that sys_poll() does to avoid overlflow (I fixed the
bug Alexey was experiencing, so I think the changes are safe now). In
any case, this code is approaching unreadable with lots of jiffies
<--> human-time units manipulations done in non-standard ways, which
the updated sys_poll() also tries to avoid.
Thanks,
Nish
