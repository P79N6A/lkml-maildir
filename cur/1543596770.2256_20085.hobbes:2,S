well, from raw(7) man page:
       raw_socket = socket(PF_INET, SOCK_RAW, int protocol);
       [...]
       All packets [...] matching the protocol number  speci
       fied  for the raw socket are passed to this socket.
so it seem to imply that only tcp packets only are to be passed.
still group "SOCK_RAW" is subset of the PF_INET group (the way
I see it), so from ip(7) man page I should use sockaddr_in
structure, which should be defined in this particular case,
as it ought be for IPPROTO_UDP.
