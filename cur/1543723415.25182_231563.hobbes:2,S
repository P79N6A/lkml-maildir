You need an allocator paired with IO memory.  If the driver allows for
DMA_MEMORY_IO then it's not unreasonable to expect it to have such
memory returned by dma_alloc_coherent() rather than adding yet another
allocator API.

No, this IO vs MAP thing is can be mapped directly to *kernel* space.
i.e. whether the driver can use it via ordinary dereferencing or has to
use the I/O memory accessor functions.

Actually, there's no point respecting the flags for the on chip region. 
Either the memory is there or it isn't.  If it isn't there, then you
either fall through to the ordinary allocator (where the flags are
respected) or fail if the DMA_MEMORY_EXCLUSIVE flag was specified.
