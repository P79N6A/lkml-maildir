And it's simple enough.  You might not even need to run "udevd"
if you don't have hotpluggable devices ... just the startup stuff,
which you might not need after the first boot.  (Since the set of
devices will be stable, /dev/* won't change, and you can speed up
system boot by that small delta.)
I certainly run udev on some small systems, with /sbin/hotplug as
appended.  Getting udev set up, and handling coldplug, is left as
an exercise for the reader.  :)
