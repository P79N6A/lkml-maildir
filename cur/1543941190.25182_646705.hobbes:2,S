No, just use interdiff and its easy :-) .. and btw
I didn't say i did a full rewrite ;-)

In what way? First i tested this patch well (compiling and
usage doesn't break a single thing) and second this (static
const struct pci_device_id .. __devinitdata) can be found in many
drivers.
So, please explain why you think so.
Thanks,
Frank
P.S.: btw this is the interdiff. Yes, its not big, but even
then why not combine it with yours ;-)
