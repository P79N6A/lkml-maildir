Sure, but havign a 24-hour latency between test-builds is not exactly a 
great way to do this ;)
For example, the one-liner that Deepak sent in will certainly fix the 
particular build error that the autobuild site has right now. But doing it 
one error at a time would be somewhat less than productive, considering 
that the patch I committed was 2695 lines ;)
Of course, assuming I did actually get most of them (and that I didn't 
introduce any stupid new syntax errors), the next autobuild report may be 
more useful. Still, I know several people have arm build environments 
already set up, so..
