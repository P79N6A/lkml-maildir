Hi Padraig,
Thanks for the patch. I applied it to fs/ramfs/inode.c
in 2.4.13-ac7 and compile it as a module in 2.4.2
(removepage was changed back to truncatepage, of
course), but it seems that memory leak still occured
(I have to stick to 2.4.2 as one of my production
systems uses it...) Any idea?
By the way, is it possible to use ramdisk with the
size larger than 600MB? /var/log/messages repeatedly
reported the following when I tried to mount a
ext2-formatted ramdisk of 600MB:
Dec  5 17:22:27 roy-home kernel: set_blocksize: dev
01:00 buffer_dirty 655360 size 1024
....
....
Dec  5 17:22:27 roy-home kernel: EXT2-fs: Magic
mismatch, very weird !
Many thanks,
Roy
