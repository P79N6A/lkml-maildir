Yep. Solaris needs this, as even the (very fast) tmpfs over RAM on Solaris
is slower than ext2 over HDD on Linux ;-)

It is _not_ the same thing. tmpfs lives in virtual memory (RAM + swap), and
it uses up memory according to the space used. ramdisk lives in RAM, and
has a fixed size. It is handled just like any other block device. Besides,
if your data resides in RAM (or a mockup of same), you can use data
structures and algorithms that are out of the question on disk. Conversely,
creating a ramdisk and mke2fs'ing it is a dumb kludge. Convenient and easy,
and saves you a special filesystem. But dumb anyway.
