After some unknown event happens, I lose my USB mouse and dmesg starts 
filling up with the following message:
    drivers/usb/input/hid-core.c: control queue full
I'm moving to -rc3 this evening - hoping this bug is gone then.  There 
are no other messages prior to this other than the broken ALSA stuff, 
but that happens since boot anyways.  The machine had been up for almost 
24 hours (random instant lockups/reboots, sometimes an hour, sometimes 
two days) before this happened.  I was away for the day so the machine 
had been idle for almost 14 hours.  Unplugging and replugging this mouse 
has zero effect, the action isn't even noticed by the computer.
