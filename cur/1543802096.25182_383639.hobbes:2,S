Len,
all I meant was that you will sometimes see conflicts. And in that
case, you are far better off cancelling the rebase and doing a merge,
where you will have to resolve the conflicts by hand.
git-rebase is for when the potential merge is clearly trivial. In any
other case, you do want a proper merge. But in any case, it is easy to
do
    git-fetch <upstream> && git-rebase <upstream>
and if it does anything but a very trivial merge, backtrack and do a merge.
In any case, if I have any suspicion that the merge may not be trivial, I do
   git-fetch <upstream> && gitk --since=" 1 month ago" upstream master
before deciding on a course of action. Of course, you can merge all
the time. It's whether people care about a readable/useful history
afterwards.
cheers,
martin
