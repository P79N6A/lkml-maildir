Nimrod,
Why would you turn the DMAing OFF in a harddrive?
Now if this happened with the kernel calling, I would be very concerned.
Since I just found that in an ERRATA series from Intel that points out
that some late PIIX4E versions crash on a DMA error and can not reset the
bus.............the reset button was the solution in the ERRATA.

Is your SEAGATE an Ultra 66 drive that has been disabled by an OEM tool?
If this is the case, use the tool again to un break the drive.
The kernel knows how to fix the drive/controller combination unless the
drive has been nuked/clobbered.
