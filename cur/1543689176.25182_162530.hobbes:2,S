It is in lots of case with IO. Especially if your state don't match
between different devices that rely on each other (parent/child
typically), or if some of that state information matches something
persistent on the HW (devices don't necessarily get fully powered
off during suspend).
Note that in most case, there isn't really a notion of "state" to
store or save anyway, that is "state" is just whatever is in your
net_device structure for a network driver, or whatever private
structure in your whatever-other driver, so you just have to restore
a couple of things on wakeup, but really nothing to save on suspend.
The single callback is much simpler, and will avoid lots of mistakes
imho.
Ben.
