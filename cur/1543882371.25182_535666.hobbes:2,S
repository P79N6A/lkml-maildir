All use the same set of ioctl() codes that
are peculiar to the synclink drivers.
Defining compat_ioctl() seems to be the best way, but
that will require modifying the base tty code to allow
the individual tty drivers to register compat_ioctl().
Currently the tty file ops do not include that and
tty_io.c does not register a compat_ioctl(), instead
relying on compat_ioctl.h and compat_ioctl.c
