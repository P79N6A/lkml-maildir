Hi,
I'm now seeing the following warnings from checkpatch:
#325: FILE: kernel/trace/trace_stat.c:21:
+	void 			*stat;
ERROR: "foo 	*bar" should be "foo *bar"
#334: FILE: kernel/trace/trace_stat.c:27:
+	struct tracer_stat 	*ts;
ERROR: "foo		*bar" should be "foo	*bar"
#337: FILE: kernel/trace/trace_stat.c:30:
+	struct dentry		*file;
This is for:
struct tracer_stat_session {
        struct list_head        session_list;
        struct tracer_stat      *ts;
        struct list_head        stat_list;
        struct mutex            stat_mutex;
        struct dentry           *file;
};
Which looks a hell of a lot better than:
struct tracer_stat_session {
        struct list_head session_list;
        struct tracer_stat *ts;
        struct list_head stat_list;
        struct mutex stat_mutex;
        struct dentry *file;
};
We probably do not want to warn on such things.
