Subject: [CPU Hotplug PATCH] Restore Idle task's priority during CPU_DEAD notification
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/5/26/30

Linus,
	Patch below (against 2.6.7-rc1) fixes a CPU Hotplug problem wherein
idle task's "->prio" value is not restored to MAX_PRIO during CPU_DEAD 
handling. Without this patch, once a CPU is offlined and then later onlined, it 
becomes "more or less" useless (does not run any task other than its idle task!)
Please apply.
