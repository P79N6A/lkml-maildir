I tried speedstep but it didn't work because of this check in
speedstep_detect_processor:
		/* Intel Pentium 4 Mobile P4-M */
		if (c->x86_model != 2)
			return 0;
		if (c->x86_mask != 4)
			return 0;     /* all those seem to support Enhanced
					 SpeedStep */
My cpu has model == 1 and mask == 2. I deleted that code just to see
what would happen, but then I tripped over this code in
pentium4_get_frequency:
	/* Don't trust unseen values yet, except in the MHz field 
	 */
	if (msr_hi || ((msr_lo & 0x00FFFFFF) != 0x300511)) {
		printk(KERN_INFO "cpufreq: Due to incomplete documentation, please send a mail to devel@brodo.de\n");
		printk(KERN_INFO "with a dmesg of a boot while on ac-power, and one of a boot on battery-power.\n");
		printk(KERN_INFO "Thanks in advance.\n");
		return 0;
	}
I removed the return statement, and then got:

There was no difference in dmesg output when booting on battery power
instead of ac power.
So what can I do to make speedstep work? According to the notebook
manual, speedstep is supported on this computer.
