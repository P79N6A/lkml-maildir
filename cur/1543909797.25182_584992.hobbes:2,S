Right... I'm talking about getting rid of it entirely.

That's why /etc/shadow would have an IRM that would block inheriting any 
permissions.

No, they don't.  At least not always.  A lot of times people want 
permissions based on where it is.

Yes, but if you move it to your front porch, you have changed the 
protection on it.  If you want to be sure of it being protected, keep it 
locked up in a safe... in other words, use the IRM.

Right.... and task->cwd would have the effective acl in memory, ready to 
be combined with any acl set on the file.

I don't see what this has to do with this discussion, and I also can't 
believe that is correct... the chdir( "../../../../.." ) should fail 
because there is no such directory.

Yes, the effective acl of the open directory is kept in memory, but in 
the directory itself, not the handle to it, thus when the directory is 
moved, it's acl is recomputed for the new location and updated 
immediately.  It is like using fcntl to set a file to non blocking... it 
is the file you set, not the handle to it, so it effects other processes 
that have inherited or duplicated the file.

I still can't see how these features cause a problem.
