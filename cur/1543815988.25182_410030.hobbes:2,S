And swapoff really helps.
Some moments of disk activity, and bang, computer is as fast as always again.
But having stuff in swap? konqueror is slow, kmail is slow, opening a konsole 
session, slow. Everything crawls with lots of disk access. 
next time the computer is slow, I could gather some data - if you tell me, 
what is interessting for you, I'll save it.
Glück Auf,
Volker
