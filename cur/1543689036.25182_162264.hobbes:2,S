1. Will the move to a more uniform driver model in 2.6 increase the chances of 
a given binary driver working with a 2.6+ kernel. 
2. Will the new model reduce the use/need for kernel modules. Would this be a 
good thing if functionality could be implemented in a driver instead of a 
module.
3. Will the practice of deliberately breaking some binary only 'tainted' 
modules prevent take up of Linux. Isn't this taking things too far?
