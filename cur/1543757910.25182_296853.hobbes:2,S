Yeah you've snuck a few other clever things in there ;)

OK - that's probably sufficient for debugging. There is only so
much that can go wrong in the middle levels... how does it look
performance wise? (I can give it a test when it gets split out)

OK after sleeping on it, I'm warming to your way.
I don't think it makes something like David's modifications any
easier, but mine didn't go a long way to that end either. And
being a more incremental approach gives us more room to move in
future (for example, maybe toward something that really *will*
accommodate the bitmap walking code nicely).
So I'd be pretty happy for you to queue this up with Andrew for
2.6.12. Anyone else?
