Hm, I wrote the following test script to test the current limit on
different unixes, and was surprised by the differences.  And, my
previous claim that RedHat must have increased this limit was wrong.
The test on RedHat showed that it had the same limit as Debian.  Not
sure why the symlinks in question seemed to be working on RedHat.
  Linux:         Symlink limit seem to be 6 path entities.
  AIX:           Symlink limit seem to be 21 path entities.
  HP-UX:         Symlink limit seem to be 21 path entities.
  Solaris:       Symlink limit seem to be 21 path entities.
  Irix:          Symlink limit seem to be 31 path entities.
  Mac OS X:      Symlink limit seem to be 33 path entities.
  Tru64 Unix:    Symlink limit seem to be 65 path entities.
I really think this limit should be increased in Linux.  Not sure how
high it should go, but from 5 to somewhere between 20 and 64 seem like
a good idea to me.
Petri Koistinen suggested that I sent my patch to
<URL:
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/rusty/trivial/>.
I'll do that, replacing 5 with 64 instead of 8.  No need to have any
lower limit than Tru64 Unix, I figure.
This is the test program I used:
