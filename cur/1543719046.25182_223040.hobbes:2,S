I know how you feel, although this is more from a manufacturers point of
view:
I develop widget X.
I contact microsoft and have X incorporated into windows.
I want to get it into free software kernels ... ???

Might be a good way to start.

The primary intention here is to make it easy for the manufacturers, not
the end users (however a nice searchable interface for users would
assuredly be a side effect).
If I have a device that has multiple connection types (eg. parallel,
usb, ethernet), who do I contact in the free software world? It's
currently not easy/ known.
It could/ should include information (perhaps in wiki or some "user
submissions") about which kernels/ distros currently have support too,
since that is useful information.

Primarily for manufacturers to provide/ submit information to.
Therefore the second primary target I guess would be developers.
Thirdly is users.
