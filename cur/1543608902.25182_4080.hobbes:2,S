hi,
i use found that in the bugtraq mailinglist:
'SuSE Security Announcement: kernel (update) (SuSE-SA:2001:039)'
i have several systems with tcp_syncookies turned on.
i turned this feature on because it makes really sense
on this systems. SuSE says one should use the rpms to update
the system. well i do not use the suse kernels, i use
the official kernel series from www.kernel.org.
so my question is now, how to fix this bug (?) in the
official release. is it fixed with 2.4.14?
