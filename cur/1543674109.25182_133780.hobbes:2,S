That's a good point, and perhaps it should be an option to not allow
ptrace or other potentially dangerous operations between processes in
different pags. But leave that optional, as it might still be useful -
for example, logging in and diagnosing a daemon running in a separate
pag.
It's not clear if this would be best as a per-pag flag or a global one
though.
