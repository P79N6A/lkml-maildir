Subject: looking for cond_syscall usage instructions

I'm adding some syscalls to the kernel based on config options.  I just came 
across cond_syscall, and it looks useful, but there are no instructions I've 
seen on exactly how to use it.
Do I just add another line to kernel/sys.c with my syscall and then wrap the 
whole syscall source with an #ifdef?
