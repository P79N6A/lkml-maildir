The idea is right but the implementation is definitely incorrect, for 
multiple reasons:
* Every PCI driver should call pci_request_regions(), because there 
should only be one pci_driver associated with that set of resources.
* Therefore, any _addition_ to the PCI API that prevents a driver from 
using pci_request_regions() causes multiple problems, by virtue of 
diverging from the other 98% of the kernel's PCI drivers, which use 
pci_request_regions().
IOW, MSI-X's implementation incorrectly constrains PCI driver authors.
* Programmer over-protection.  Who is attempting to stomp on MSI-X 
tables?  If a driver is reading an MSI-X bar and doing something without 
consulting the kernel MSI-X code, that's a bug and most likely a 
violation of the PCI spec.  Fix the driver.
In Linux we don't over-protect programmers with a zillion sanity checks 
for every internal API call; that leads to bloat, and papers over bugs 
that should be fixed.
