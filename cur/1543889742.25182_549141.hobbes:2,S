And what do you expect? We have three people working on
hibernation, and suspend-to-ram was created as "oh, if we do this,
this, and this, we get get suspend-to-ram with existing code".

You'd be seriously overstaffed in FPU side, and seriously understaffed
on ALU side.
This is basically what happened here. I tell people to get hibernation
to work _first_ because it is usually easier.
And what does that mean? We need three people to work on
suspend-to-RAM. Heck, we need at least _one_ person to work on
suspend-to-RAM, but he needs to be listed in MAINTAINERS.
With hibernation people trying to maintain suspend in their spare
cycles, how do you expect suspend to work? Similar to hibernation,
that's how it looks today.
