IIRC the default is 5, from the graph you posted going to 6 or 7 would be 
a fairly significant win (final size to final size) without eathing _that_ 
much more cpu.
instead of doing the compression when doing the modules_install do it when 
they are compiled (just like we do for the kernel itself). if you just 
spent the cpu to build the thing, the cpu to compress it isn't much.

if I'm reading the numbers correctly that's about 16% of the space taken 
by the final result

watch out for a deadlock here. the more external tools that you need to 
get at the kernel modules, the more likely it is that one of those tools 
will need something that you can't get to without the modules loaded.
