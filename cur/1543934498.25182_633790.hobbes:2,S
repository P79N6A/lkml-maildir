Hello,
          I have a one question.
          If I have to add  additional external flag on my external kernel module source during compilation with KBUILD.
          lest say I have one kernel module file hello.c
          and I want to add one flag -D testdebug.
        suppose this is my makefile.
obj-m += hello.o
all:
 make -C /lib/modules/$(shell uname -r)/build M=$(PWD) modules
clean:
 make -C /lib/modules/$(shell uname -r)/build M=$(PWD) clean
where I can add this flag.
Any help will be appreciated.
Thanks and Regards

Hello sam,
Thanks for your time.
Any way, we already had a lot discussion.
It just matter of interest nothing else.
Actually it is just a curiosity to know little bit 
Internals of KBUILD and module versioning.
You can say, it is my bad habit when I start work on
something.
I want to understand it from base.
Unfortunately this time I didn’t get much information
from google.
Neither from kernel documentation.
I don’t have any issue on using KBUILD.
Sorry again.
Thanks for your suggestion and view.
