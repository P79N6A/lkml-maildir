I might be a bit confused here, but the problem with that, is that I'm 
effectively working backwards.  I've reverted the kernel version, but 
all other applications have been kept of course - this means that 
though I can keep those sym-links pointing to the correct kernel 
headers (those which were present when glibc was compiled), the current 
kernel (the reverted one) will obviously have different include files.
In order to compile the modules for the afformentioned hardware, those 
symlinks need to point to the 2.2.x kernel directories - will this 
break functionality of future compiled applications etc?

right - luckily, at least so far, the modules and the applications that 
we have built for the hardware works on the newer (minor version update 
2.2.14 -> 2.2.26) kernel.
