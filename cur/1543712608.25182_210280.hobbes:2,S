See 
http://www.kernelnewbies.org/faq/index.php3#headers
The correct place, I've read, to get the headers for the current running
kernel is /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/build/include ... which of course
assumes that you keep your kernel in the same place you built it from,
but that's not a worse assumption than whatever you'd assume for
/usr/include/{linux,asm} symlinks to work I'm sure.
Basically, the potential problem as I understand it is binary
incompatibility with the currently installed glibc.
