What if you really need to initialize them at runtime?  You're putting
a static initializer there simply to mask an obscure toolchain bug.
I'd really prefer dotting:
	/* FIXME: Initializer required so gcc 2.96 doesn't put in BSS */
	DEFINE_PER_CPU(int, xxx) = 0;
everywhere, which can be deleted later, to enforcing it for everyone
in the infrastructure when it doesn't always make sense.
Rusty.
