I am having an issue with a Supermicro h8dce motherboard and failure to 
recognize a 5th SATA drive after upgrading to Fedora 7.
This motherboard has 8 sata ports that use the sata_nv driver.
The lack of seeing the 5th SATA drive shows up in 2.6.22 kernels, such 
as kernel-2.6.22.2-42.fc6 and kernel-2.6.22.1-41.fc7.
The 5th SATA drive can still be detected in 2.6.20 kernels such as 
kernel-2.6.20-1.2933.fc6 (I am currently using this kernel).
 From dmesg, it appears the reason I am not seeing the 5th SATA drive 
(second SATA controller) is the following error:
Aug 30 14:08:03 alcor kernel: sata_nv 0000:80:08.0: Using ADMA mode
Aug 30 14:08:03 alcor kernel: PCI: *Unable to reserve mem region* 
#6:1000@dfefd000 for device 0000:80:08.0
Aug 30 14:08:03 alcor kernel: ACPI: PCI interrupt for device 
0000:80:08.0 disabled
Aug 30 14:08:03 alcor kernel: sata_nv: probe of 0000:80:08.0 failed with 
error -16
sata_nv that comes with the 2.6.22 kernels appear to be version 3.4 
while the older kernels comes with version 3.2 (which work). I contacted 
Robert Hancock directly about this and he suggested I post an email to LKML.
Motherboard: 
http://www.supermicro.com/Aplus/motherboard/Opteron/nForce/H8DCE.cfm
Single AMD Opteron(tm) Processor 244
1 GB of memory.
I can send you the complete dmesg output if you would like.
Thanks!
