Actually, this is not completly true.  The kernel sets a flag while 
handling interrupts that says it is within an interrupt.  This flag is 
cleared on the way out of the interrupt but prior to the return from 
interrupt (rfi) instruction.  Between this flag clearing and the rfi, 
there is a check made to see if the kernel is preemptable and, if so, if 
it is desired (i.e. something more important should run NOW).  If both 
of these are true, schedule is called to do the context switch.  So, 
schedule IS called from within the interrupt, but NOT within the area 
the kernel flags as being in an interrupt which is a subset of the 
actual interrupt.
