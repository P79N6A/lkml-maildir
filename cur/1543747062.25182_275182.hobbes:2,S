and (d) on x86 at least the "atomic" part of the atomic ops are #ifdef
CONFIG_SMP, which might well not be set in userland... so you get a

it's not the kernel's job to provide this functionality imo. 
glibc could. glib does. apr does. there's several options already.
apr is BSD licensed for exanpmle, glib LGPL.
