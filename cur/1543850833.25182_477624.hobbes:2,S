Yes, the module reference counting needs to be completely redone.
This try_find_module() function is only used as:
 > +	pl080_driver.drv.owner = try_find_module(MODULE_NAME);
which as far as I can see should just be
	pl080_driver.drv.owner = THIS_MODULE;
But there's also stuff like
 > +static int pl080_request(dmach_t cnum, dma_t * cdata){
 > +	int retval = -EINVAL;
 > +
 > +	/* Increase the usage */
 > +	if(try_module_get(pl080_driver.drv.owner)){
 > +		retval = 0;
 > +	}
which of course can never work -- this is inside the pl080 module so
it's already too late to take a reference.
The module refcounting just needs to be rethought.
