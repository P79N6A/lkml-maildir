hehe ;-)  well,
* I've hit this situation in real life (waiting on a driver doing
  error handling, hogging the single shared workqueue on UP).  It 
  actually gets nasty if a bunch of drivers all throw errors at
  the same time... (more below)
* re "improve the drivers" -- if you mean "fixing" those hogging the
  shared workqueue, I think that's a workqueue API flaw.  If you mean
  further fix up the drivers you just modified, well... I think
  slackness on my part will win there :)
There was talk in another thread about fixing up workqueue to create
a new kernel thread, if one isn't available within five seconds.
That seemed reasonable to me.  Another useful addition to workqueue,
for drivers, would be a one-shot thread "runme(func, func_data)" API.
I think a lot of the device driver error handling is more appropriate
to this one-shot API than the current workqueue API.  Error handling is
already a slow path, so the overhead of thread creation on each call is
mitigated.
