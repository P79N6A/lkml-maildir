Subject: [PATCH 000 of 8] knfsd: cleanups for exportfs code.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Following are 8 patches from Christoph Hellwig which tidy up the
"exportfs" code used by nfsd for communicating with filesystems about
the handling of filehandles.
One change of note is that the old "iget" approach to filehandle
lookup is moved out of generic code and into the two filesystems that
still use it (including jfs: hence the Cc to shaggy@austin.ibm.com).
These are for -mm until 2.6.23 opens.
