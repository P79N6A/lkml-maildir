If the hash table itself has more than 256 entries, then it
would certainly produce better randomness.  The small random
table entries would mean you are only hashing to the low
end of the hash table.
In Linux x86, the size of the hash table is 2048 (1 << PAGE_HASH_BITS),
so your hash function, as implemented, would be very bad.
