Okay, thanks.  It doesn't actually give one more register except in the 
F3 rounds (TMP2 is normally used to hold the magic constants) but it's a 
good cleanup.

I got this code from Nettle, originally, and I never looked at the SHA-1 
round structure very closely.  I'll give that approach a try.
Thanks
