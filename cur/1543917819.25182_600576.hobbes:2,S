this cset added it (and has a pretty explanatory commit msg)

    invalidate_mapping_pages(): add cond_resched
    invalidate_mapping_pages() can sometimes take a long time (millions of pages
    to free).  Long enough for the softlockup detector to trigger.
    We used to have a cond_resched() in there but I took it out because the
    drop_caches code calls invalidate_mapping_pages() under inode_lock.
    The patch adds a nasty flag and puts the cond_resched() back.
