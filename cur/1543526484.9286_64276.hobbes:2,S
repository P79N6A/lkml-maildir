Subject: Masquerading doesn't work for FTP PORT command

I have 2.2.14 kernel and ipchains 1.3.8. I set masquerading for one
host on 198.61.23.0 network:
[root@snowbird linux]# ipchains -L
Chain input (policy ACCEPT):
Chain forward (policy ACCEPT):
target     prot opt     source                destination          
ports
MASQ       all  ------  198.61.23.1           anywhere              n/a
Chain output (policy ACCEPT):             
Everything (that is web browsing) works fine except FTP PORT command. I
watched the traffic with tcpdump and it shows that it handles that
packet the same way it handles regular TCP packet, that is, changes its
source ip and port number, but leaves TCP data part the same. In other
words, ip address and port number inside PORT command are not
masqueraded.
Is it possible to have masquerading compiled into kernel but without FTP
masquerading?
Any suggestions?
Thanks.
