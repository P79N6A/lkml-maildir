Oops, the 'and' should be an 'end'. So your wording is correct.

We don't want to make them too large anyway, and I think that 64k-1 is
more than enough. Maybe it would even be better to simply use an even
32kb. Consider someone writing in chunks of 64kb. It would simply suck
to get one 65024b request followed by a 512b one.
