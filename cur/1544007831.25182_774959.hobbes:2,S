Subject: [PATCH] Don't export sched_mc_power_savings in laptops
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

        Fix to prevent sched_mc_power_saving from being exported through sysfs
        for multicore single socket (Laptop).
        CPU core map of the boot cpu should be equal to possible number
        of cpus for single socket system.
        This fix has been developed at FOSS.in kernel workout.
