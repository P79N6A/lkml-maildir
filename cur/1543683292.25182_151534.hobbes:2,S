Probably some initcall has more spin_lock()s than spin_unlock()s and the
init process's preempt count ended up permanently out of whack.
Please boot with "initcall_debug=1" on the boot command line and if you see
a line of the form:
error in initcall at 0xXXXXXXXX: returned with preemption imbalance
then please look up 0xXXXXXXXX in System.map and let us know.
