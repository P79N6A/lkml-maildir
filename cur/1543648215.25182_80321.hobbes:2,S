Subject: Set timestamp on symlink?

I can query a symlink's timestamp with lstat(2), but can't seem to set it.  
Attempting to set it with utime() twiddles the file it points to (which in 
this case is on a read-only partition).
Is there some kind of lutime(2) call I should be using?  Can't find a man 
page on it...
