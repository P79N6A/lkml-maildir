That's also a bug.
So imagine that there is another user keeping the bdev active. Implying
that you never even try to sync it at all. That sounds like a bad thing to
do.

You said you used truncate_inode_pages(), which _does_ throw the pages
away.  Dirty or not.
What I'm saying is that you at _every_ close (sane semantics for block
devices really do expect the writes to be flushed by close time - how
would they otherwise ever be flushed reliably?) do something like
	fsync(inode);
	invalidate_inode_pages(inode);
	invalidate_device(inode->b_dev);
and be done with it. That syncs the pages that we've dirtied, and it
invalidates all pages that aren't pinned some way. Which is exactly what
you want.

Ehh? Why? The above writes back exactly the same thing that our current
block filesystem writes back. While "invalidate_device()" also throws away
all buffers that aren't pinned.
And the superblock isn't in the buffer cache - it's cached separately, so
invalidate_device() will throw away the buffer associated with it - to be
re-read and re-written by the rw remount.
Will it be different than the current behaviour wrt some other metadata?
Yes. So you could make invalidate_device() stronger, trying to re-read
buffers that aren't dirty. But that doesn't mean that you should act
differently on FS mounted vs not-mounted vs some-other-user.
