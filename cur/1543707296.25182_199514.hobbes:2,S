In a modern kernel you can safely multiply mount file systems.  In
particular, if you are going to pivot_root you might be better off and
happier if you mount devfs and procfs (and sysfs) in both the old and new
locations before the pivot.
So mount /dev and /proc and /sysfs (etc) as needed before the pivot.
Mount /new-root.
Then mount /new-root/dev /new-root/proc /new-root/sysfs /new-root/dev/devpts
(etc) as you expect to need it after the pivot
Do the pivot.
Then unmount the unneeded /old-root/dev etc.
This should make things much more convenient.
Mount what you need, but don't mount things that init scripts will mount
later.  There isn't much harm to be had in mounting something over itself
(e.g. "mount -t devfs devfs /dev" twice in a row) but it keeps things like
/proc/mounts nice and tidy if you keep it all straight.

I see the confusion - .devfsd gets created in the directory that is
/dev at the time devfs starts up.  However, after pivot_root, that directory
has a new name, and that's where we need to check for .devfsd.
It gets even more confusing in some configurations where we end up
unmounting
/initrd/dev and then re-mounting /dev just to get it into the right place..
