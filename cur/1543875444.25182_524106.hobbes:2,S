THT == TDH -> this is a 'bogus' tx hang indicating that one or more parts
in the TX patch is not properly enabled.
Most likely, I suspect that we haven't enabled something because the ordering
of irq free/alloc was messed up and nobody cared before, but with all the
pci_save_state fixes going in we hit a bump.
The reset kicks it all back up in order so it's something silly like this for
sure.
The attached patch fixes that and sitting in my queue for a few days. Can you
see if that works?
