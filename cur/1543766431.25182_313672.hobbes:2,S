I solve this with two simple scripts, "sign" calls "cutsig".
--------------
sign
#!/bin/sh
DEFAULT_KEY="my-private-key-string"
CUTSIG=~/bin/cutsig.pl
usage()
{
    echo "usage: $0 filename"
    echo " produces filename.sign"
}
if [ $# -lt 1 ]; then
   usage
   exit 1;
fi
gpg --armor --clearsign --detach-sign --default-key "${DEFAULT_KEY} -v -v -o - ${1} | \
${CUTSIG} > ${1}.sign
exit 0
-----------------
cutsig
#!/usr/bin/perl -w
do {
    $line = <STDIN>;
} until $line =~ "-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----";
print $line;
while ( $line = <STDIN>) {
    print $line;
}
exit 0;
