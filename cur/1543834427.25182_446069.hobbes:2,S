 Hi,
 yesterdat I wanted to bisect my kernel problem, but failed at first step:
cloning Linus' tree. Today I tried it on other system and also failed.
 This is git-1.4.0 on Slackware, i586:
%  git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git linux-git
fatal: packfile '/home/zdzichu/linux-git/.git/objects/pack/tmp-1jI4AH' SHA1 mismatch
error: git-fetch-pack: unable to read from git-index-pack
error: git-index-pack died with error code 128
fetch-pack from 'git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git' failed.
 And this is 1.4.0-1.fc5 on FC5, x86_64:
% git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git linux-git
fatal: packfile '/home/tomek/linux-git/.git/objects/pack/tmp-BxIcIC' SHA1 mismatch
error: git-fetch-pack: unable to read from git-index-pack
error: git-index-pack died with error code 128
fetch-pack from 'git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git' failed.
 Errors occur constantly since yesterday. They of course appear after
downloading several megabytes of data, which is unpleasant on my 128kbps
connection.
