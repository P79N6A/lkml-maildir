I was suggesting that we hash the futex on mm+vaddr.  Yes, differing vaddrs
break that.
umm, how about hashing only on offset into page?  That reduces the number of
threads which need to be visited in futex_wake() by a factor of up to 1024.
In futext_wake(), fault in and pin the page, then for each thread which is
waiting on a futex which has the same offset into a page, do a
get_user_pages+follow_page, see if he's waiting on the just-faulted-in
page?
