They're in current process's vm. You just have to parse it yourself.
something along the (untested) lines:
        struct mm_struct *mm = current ? get_task_mm(current) : NULL;
        if (mm) {
                unsigned env_len = mm->env_end - mm->env_start;
                char* env = kmalloc(env_len, GFP_KERNEL);
                access_process_vm(current, mm->env_start, env,
                                           env_len, 0);
                /* env is now a big buffer containing null-terminated
                   strings representing evironment variables */
                mmput(mm);
        }
