Subject: [PATCH] 2.5.4-pre6 apm compile fix
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi Linus,
The attached patch fixes the following compiler warning in -pre6:
apm.c: In function `apm_mainloop':
apm.c:1376: warning: comparison between pointer and integer
apm.c:1384: warning: comparison between pointer and integer
nr_running is really a function and not an integer.
I believe this had already been applied in earlier 2.5 and then somehow
vanished, probably due to an update by whoever maintains apm.c
Regards,
-Udo.
