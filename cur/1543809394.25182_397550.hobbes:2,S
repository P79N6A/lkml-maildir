yeah, agreed. That will be accurately fixed via GTOD's per-hwclock 
resolution values. It will have another advantage as well: e.g. the 
whole of m68k wont be penalized via CONFIG_TIME_LOW_RES for having a 
handful of sub-arches (Apollo, Sun3x, Q40) that dont have a higher 
resolution timer - every clock can define its own resolution. You could 
help that effort by porting m68k to use GTOD ;-)
