Yes it does.  It's certainly sold as a RAID card and it does have a RAID setup 
menu.  I haven't had the opportunity to use it fully as the discs I needed to 
use on it were already set up for software RAID.  Maybe I'll have a couple 
spare(!) discs to play with if I upgrade to SATA.
It seems that the operation depends on the firmware, or should that be BIOS, 
you load onto the card.  There's this from the IT8212 FAQ, 
http://www.ite.com.tw/faq/it8212.html
1. Could I use IT8212 for CD-ROM? 
Ans:  IT8212 supports either RAID controller (which supports hard drives
only) or pure IDE controller (which supports hard drives and CDROM)
with different BIOS code. Please update your BIOS ROM with ATAPI
BIOS.
There are certainly two files available
http://www.ite.com.tw/pc/bios_8212Raid-093015-02.zip
and
