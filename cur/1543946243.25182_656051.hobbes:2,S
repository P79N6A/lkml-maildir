Only issue seems that this large ISDN user base is not very active
in respect to Linux driver development.
Or at least not judging from the missing responses to their
mailing list and the limited traffic on said mailing list.
Reading the isdn4linux it is obvious that the way forward are the
mISDN code base so maybe that explains why noone steps up and 
test the patches of Jeff's.
If noone in the isdn community step up and take some responsibility
for the current isdn drivers in Linux then we should just delete them.
If anyone cares they can always be forwardported or even better we can 
integrate the much more flexible mISDN solution.

My guess is that very very few uses ISDN in combination with a recent kernel.
Hmm, wonder if it is more fun hacking isdn drivers than kbuild
stuff and section mismatches ;-)
