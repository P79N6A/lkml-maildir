My drive has suffered simiar failure. After being fixed or replaced is
all fine. No problems and fast access times. If it fails again, I will
not buy IBM anymore. One of companies I worked for, wanted to buy a mainframe,
but technical staff they were sending us, were might as well been Futureshop/Frys
salesment types to help with understanding how loaner worked. Service for
rack equipment we ordered at the time was terrible. There were awfully fast,
but we had to figure all the stuff ourselves. Sort of like during MITS times,
were you put your computer together. Duh.
