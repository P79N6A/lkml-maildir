You are asking for meaningless object. Filesystem may be mounted from many
places.

IOW, you want meaningless behaviour. Fine.

Care to show the actual code? Showing what are your really trying to do

See above.

Because the old mechanisms were broken by several things, inclusion of
devfs being one of them.
