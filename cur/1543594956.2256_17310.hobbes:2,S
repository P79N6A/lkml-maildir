Unfortunately, your position will result in reduce hardware support.  There are
companies out there that will not release the source code to their drivers.  By
preventing binary-only drivers, you're basically telling those companies, "I
don't care who needs your hardware to work under Linux, I won't let you ship
your drivers." 
Besides, your opinion on this matter is irrelevant.  Linus has already decided
to allow binary-only drivers.  The question is not WHETHER it is allowed, but
HOW it will be allowed.  Please stay on topic.

None, as far as I know, and that's the problem.  By Linus saying, "including
kernel header files doesn't make your driver a derivative work", he is
effectively _weakening_ a provision in the GPL _as a whole_ (assuming that you
believe including header files makes your work a derivative, which I don't).
