Actually, if CAD is enabled in the kernel, it will just reboot.
If CAD is disabled in the kernel a SIGINT is sent to pid 1 (/sbin/init).
So what you probably had in the not-too-distant past was a disabled CAD
in the kernel _and_ you had modified the following line in /etc/inittab,
    # What to do when CTRL-ALT-DEL is pressed.
    ca:12345:ctrlaltdel:/sbin/shutdown -t1 -a -r now
AFAIK this hasn't ever really changed.
