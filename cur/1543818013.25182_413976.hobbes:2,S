Can we stop missquoting on both sides please ? I did not jump in. I

I unfortunately forgot to add an IMHO to every single sentence, but "I
don't think so." should have made it clear, that this is my opinion.
Maybe my knowledge of the English language is worse than I thought.

At least should the design allow that. Making restrictions in such a
layer upfront due to requirements of some known hardware devices would
be bad.

Why does this require a hard coupled design ? You want a periodic event
for X with as much precision as available. Let the system choose one
which fits this best.

It does not necessarily require a periodic event. It depends on the type
of clock source you are using and the requirements of synchronization.
The DCF-77 card in one of my boxen gives me auto sychronized time with
1nsec resolution without any periodic event. Also embedded systems which
do not use NTP do not need a periodic event for gettimeofday() when
there is a continous clock source available.
If the NTP mechanisms needs a precise periodic event, then it can
request it from the layer which manages those events.

So we move it into clock source because there is nothing else right
now ? That sounds like moving the mess you identified in x386 from there
to a another place.
IMO this is well worth a discussion how we want to solve this in a solid
and generic way.

Sorry Roman, your way of discussion is not understandable to me. On one
hand you ask for explanations. When you get them, you just brush them
aside. Thanks for reminding me that my efforts to communicate with you
just produce unimportant blurb.
