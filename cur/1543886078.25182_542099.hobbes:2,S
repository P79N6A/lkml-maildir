OK, then what does it matter what the glibc/kernel interface is, as
long as it works?
It's only a minor point; the order of arguments can vary between
architectures if necessary, but it's nicer if they don't have to.
32-bit powerpc will need to have the two int arguments adjacent in
order to avoid using more than 6 argument registers at the user/kernel
boundary, and s390 will need to avoid having a 64-bit argument last
(if I understand it correctly).
Paul.
