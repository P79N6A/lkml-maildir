So you can run only 256 'ls', while I (on my overcommitting system)
run 25600 of them.

2GB reserved *for stack*...  you need more for "normal" paging.

about 60MB == 56MB + (some RAM has to ge used by the system...)  B-)

What? You're assuming that page-in frees swap? What for? Swap space
remains allocated after a page-in, i think. I hope! I really hope
the kernel DOES NOT allocted / deallocate disk blocks at EVERY page-out/
page-in. It allocates swap only once. Either at brk() or fork() time
(non overcommitting) or at the first page-out (overcommitting). 
Swap gets deallocated only when a process exits. That why, in a OOS
situation, the only solution is killing.
OOS should be avoided. Full stop. Moreover, it's likely that you reach
OOS only after the system is completely stuck with thrashing, which in
turn should be avoided. On a correctly configured system, you should never
see OOS. Killing is not a proposed system behaviour for *normal* conditions..

The above example was just to state that you should ignore RAM when you
preallocate. Do all computations over free *swap* space. Do not count
free RAM as free VM.
