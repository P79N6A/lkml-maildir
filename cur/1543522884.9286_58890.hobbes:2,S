All of these machines have 256 MB.

We will try this and report back.  Looking at the source, this surely
seems like a feature we can do without.

These are the only two I've seen in detail.  I believe they are
generally the same, but that's hard to check.

These machines don't have floppy drives or keyboards either.  Only a few
have video cards (which is one reason we only have a few dumps).  If we
can't get it solved another way, perhaps we can set up machines with
more hardware from which we can get more crash data.  For now, it's not
clear that collecting more dumps that look the same will help, though?
