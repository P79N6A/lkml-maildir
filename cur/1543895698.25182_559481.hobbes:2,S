The other difference is that you can't execute an extended attribute.
You can store kvm/qemu, a complete virtualization enviroment, shared
libraries, and other executables all inside a forks inside a file, and
then execute programs/rootkit out of said file fork(s).
As I mentioned in my LCA presentation, one system administrator
refused to upgrade beyond Solaris 8 because he thought forks were good
for nothing but letting system crackers hide rootkits that wouldn't be
detected by programs like tripwire.  The question then is why in the
world would we want to replicate Sun's mistakes?
