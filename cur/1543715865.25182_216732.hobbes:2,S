There are many funtions that are called for their effect (like printf),
and many functions that return the same value that they were passed,
like memcpy(), memmove(), strcpy(), strncpy(), etc.
In the subject code, the effect of the function was to condition
some parameters and call another function, returning the same
value it was passed. Sounds good to me.
