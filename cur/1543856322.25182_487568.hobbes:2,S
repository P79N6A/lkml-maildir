Hi Linus, Greg/Chris,

      Revert "ACPI: SCI interrupt source override"
with this log:
commit 7bdd21cef9e5dbc3d3a718c55bb3d0da024644da

    Revert "ACPI: SCI interrupt source override"
    This reverts commit 281ea49b0c294649a6de47a6f8fbe5611137726b,
    which broke ACPI Interrupt source overrides that move
    the SCI from one IRQ in PIC mode to another in IOAPIC mode.
    If the SCI shared an interrupt line with another device,
    this would result in a "irq 18: nobody cared" type failure.
