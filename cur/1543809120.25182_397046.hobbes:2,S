Jeff,
I'd have to double check but I do not recall getting these errors before 
the pass-thru code was introduced in 2.6.15, I also was not running the 
smart daemon until 2.6.15 for SATA drives as it was not supported.
I had a few issues before that I posted to LKML, those were due to too 
many SATA devices etc, everything is back to normal for the most part.
Speed, etc, all is well again, almost...
/dev/sdc:
  Timing buffered disk reads:  154 MB in  3.02 seconds =  50.97 MB/sec
/dev/sdc:
  Timing buffered disk reads:  162 MB in  3.00 seconds =  53.94 MB/sec
The only issue I have is when I copy a lot of files to a WD 400GB drive I 
these pesky errors in dmesg:
  ata3: translated ATA stat/err 0x51/04 to SCSI SK/ASC/ASCQ 0xb/00/00
  ata3: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
  ata3: error=0x04 { DriveStatusError }
Yet, everything copied (226GB) or so to the 400GB drive without a single 
I/O error that I am aware of.  So my question is, why do I get these 
errors in dmesg if they are not critical?
Thanks,
Justin.
