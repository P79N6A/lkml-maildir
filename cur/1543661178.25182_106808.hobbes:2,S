Correct, at least for mainstream architectures.
The rationale here is that we already put a lot of constraints on what
tools people need to build a kernel. If we can avoid an extra
_mandatory_ tool then this will make life easier for a lot of people.
For optional features additional requirements are OK, for example
to geneate docbook documentation a lot of extra stuff is needed.

It would be good to get a replacement, but until that shows up.
Then yes an optional frontend that uses qt is OK.
kconfig is prepared for and one gtk frontend is on the way.
If someone comes up with a decent perl based frontend ten that could be
considered.

flex and bison is better for this job.
