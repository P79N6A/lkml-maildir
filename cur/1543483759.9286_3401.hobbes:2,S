Subject: kernel panic in 2.2.1

i suspect i've been getting these in the past, but i don't usually
have a monitor on my udb to pick them up. in any case, i just got the
following kernel panic whilst dialed up:
  Kernel panic: skput: over: fffffe000003b8a0:60 put:-7 dev:eth0
  In swapper task - not syncing
needless to say, nothing got into the logs. if i look in the ksyms for
the above number, i get ppp_crc16_table_Rcacc1f6a as the closest
symbol although ppp_unregister_compressor_Ra1b928df looks more
interesting. 
the panic always seems to happen when i'm dialed up although it never
seems to happen right after rebooting. in case it makes a difference,
i use ip masquerading to hide my internal network behind the udb.
some specifics: udb/alpha 
     		binutils 2.9.1.0.15
		egcs-1.1.1
any ideas on what's happening here?
