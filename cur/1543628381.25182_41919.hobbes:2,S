If you have recent (2.2.0.18/2.2.0.19) ncpfs, format v4 is used (it allows
for 32bit uid/gid). I have no non-ia32 test environment, so if anybody finds 
that ncpfs does not work on any platform, feel free to send patches either 
to me or to arch maintainers...

I plan using ASCII format too, but it is not high enough on my TODO list.
If it will make life for Al or other architectures easier, I'll do it
sooner...
