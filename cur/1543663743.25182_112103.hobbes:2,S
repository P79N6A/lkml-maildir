Note that I made cardbus bus numbering _ignore_ the BIOS-setup numbering 
even on PC's, exactly because of issues like this - trying to keep the 
original BIOS numbering just won't work if the BIOS sets the wrong numbers 
(I saw a BIOS that had happily assigned the _same_ PCI bus number to both 
cardbus functions, whee).
I think we can (and should) make all hotpluggable PCI bridges use that 
same cardbus logic.
The real problematic case I see is if there are transparent hotplug
bridges, with some devices just magically appear and disappear from a part 
of a bus because of some invisible bridge. I don't know if such things 
exist or even _can_ exist, but the perverse nature of PC hardware makes me 
suspect they do.
