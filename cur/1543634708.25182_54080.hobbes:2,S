  now this is really strange - after FEW DAYS of load 99% and not being
able to interrupt cleanup (I attached gdb to it and hit ctrl-c) it was
finally interrupted and now it's in:
(gdb) where
#0  0x401f82e4 in open () from /lib/libc.so.6
#1  0x4004354c in rewrite_clnt_stream () from
/usr/lib/libpostfix-global.so.1
#2  0x40038151 in mail_stream_file () from
/usr/lib/libpostfix-global.so.1

#8  0x400286ce in single_server_main () from

#9  0x08049c4e in dict_changed ()
#10 0x4014e14f in __libc_start_main () from /lib/libc.so.6
(gdb) 
  I guess that since it's still in open function of libc it was stuck in
open system call?
  any ideas about what's going on?
