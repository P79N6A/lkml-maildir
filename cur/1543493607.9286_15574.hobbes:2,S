Siddharth,
I just fiddled with imwheel to get it to work on my system.
I doesn't seem to generate mouse clicks, at least not through
any Linux-level interface.
It does generate Page Up/Page Down (\034\[[56]~) when you scroll
the wheel, but that's all I saw.
Now, imwheel *does* work with X11, but that's an entirely
seperate issue. Refer to any decent X11 programmer's manual
and read up about intercepting input events and then re-
generating them.
Cheers,
Joshua.
