I assume the applikcaton has already been killed at this stage, and it is
blocked in the kernel running the truncate?

Did this succeed?  If the application is still truncating that file, the
umount should have failed.

That opened-but-deleted file's inode is on the orphan list.
See, the unlink-then-slowly-truncate trick is done in this fashion so that
if the box crashes during the slow unlink, the orhpan list handling on the
reboot will finish off the truncate for us.

Wait for the killed-off applicaiton to actually exit, perhaps?  But
that unmount should have failed.
