What I had intended when I wrote this code was that platforms that didn't
want to use the generic SAL code (and why not?  It doesn't seem like it
should be the hardest thing in the world to move your hacks into SAL)
was that people should override
  struct pci_raw_ops *raw_pci_ops = &pci_sal_ops;
by just assigning raw_pci_ops in their own code.  I haven't looked at
the SGI code yet, but this is how arch/i386/pci/direct.c (for example)
works.
> Maybe rename pci_root_ops to "acpi_pci_ops" would make that clearer.
No.  Don't rename it to anything ACPI specific.  It isn't.  It's just an
alternative route to access configuration space when you don't even
have a PCI bus, let alone a device.
