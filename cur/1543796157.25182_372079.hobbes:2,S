Subject: mouse resync messages since 2.6.15-rc2-mm1, still in 2.6.15-rc3-mm1

I access my workstations with a KVM switch, a Rose Vista model, and
since 2.6.15-rc2-mm1, I get an awful lot of
logips2pp: Detected unknown logitech mouse model 1
psmouse.c: resync failed, issuing reconnect request
messages. What is the information content in these messages? I take it
they tell me something important - but I can't understand what. If they
are just noise, could they please be removed?
I know my mouse works when I switch consoles; this KVM has worked for
ages with linux. 
I can always #if 0 them out myself, but I'm curious what the meaning of
these messages is.
Thanks,
Jurriaan

Fire control was manual now. So was the coffeemaker, but with green
smoke gathering under the ceiling, that didn't seem as crucial somehow.
