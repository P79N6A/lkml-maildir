Lots of stuff assumes that PID 0 is the idle task, and that PID 1 is init.
For example, the kernel disallows ptraceing of init, based on its pid of 1.
If you are PID 1, make sure that you handle SIGCHLDs etcetera from daemons.
Check the source of init, I suspect it does something which tells the kernel
'I am your init'.
