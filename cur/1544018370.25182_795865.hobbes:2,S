Hi,
This is heavy RFC, only compile tested so far..
Nick ran into the fact that the IRQ state tracker isn't readily
extensible and requires a lot of manual duplication of stuff.
This series tries to address that.
The only function that remains is mark_irqflags() which seems to contain
the actual state interaction, and can thus not easily be unified.
