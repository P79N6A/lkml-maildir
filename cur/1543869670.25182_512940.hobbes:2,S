As was mentioned in another reply, this message by

http://lists.debian.org/debian-sparc/2007/02/msg00045.html
gives a possible explanantion of where the time is going.
I applied the patch to the debian kernel sources for 2.6.18,
it applied cleanly and fixed the problem.
I have the upatched kernel in /boot so I can run the tests
you mentioned fairly easily -- please let me know if you'd
still like me to do that.
