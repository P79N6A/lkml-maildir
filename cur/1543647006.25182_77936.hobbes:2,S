This would be the BugBear Virus you received.  BugBear is running rampant,
so you'll likely see more from your windows friends.
Check for details on:
http://www.cert.org/current/current_activity.html#W32BugBear
You can rest assured, I bet everyone on the list got it as a consequence of
it being sent to a list address, probably someone has linux-kernel in their
address book, on their windows machine.
Check the e-mail header you posted, and the following IP.  That is the
original sender.
