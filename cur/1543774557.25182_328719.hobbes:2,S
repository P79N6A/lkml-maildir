OK, for the VM_RESERVED case, it looks like it won't be much of a problem
because get_user_pages faults on VM_IO regions (which is already set in
remap_pfn_range which is used by mem.c and most drivers). So this code will
simply not encounter VM_RESERVED regions - well obviously, get_user_pages
should be made to explicitly check for VM_RESERVED too, but the point being
that introducing such a check will not overly restrict drivers.
[snip SetPageDirty is wrong]
Not that this helps the existing bug...
