Well, I hope we can *discuss* ideas for models that could accommodate
all platforms.

I tend to agree.

Nobody suggested such a thing.

Geez, how about we spend a little time thinking about it *now*?
Perhaps Rusty can come up with a model that will be easy to program
for *and* work well for all platforms.  Wouldn't that be neat?  If
not, we can always fall back on the sledge hammer (unlike other
platforms, ia64 performance isn't affected much be extraneous memory
barriers).
