OK,
thanks to all that sorted this out for me. What mislead me
big time was my old manpage for nanosleep() which claimed
to busywait for short nanosleeps().
2.6 doesn't seem to do that.
I will look into the suggested patches. Just hate not being able
to just grab the latest kernel from kernel.org and throw it in there.
Already have to recompile a Matrox display module. Now this would
be an additional problem nuisance.
But once again thanks to all
Dag
