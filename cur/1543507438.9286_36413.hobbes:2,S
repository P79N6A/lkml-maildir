Subject: Would like to see-- [PATCH] Driver support for AAC-364

Anyone know about Adaptec Quad Channel Raid (specifically AAC-364) support
anytime soon?  I know its a pretty new card but ..... (and its not the 'AAA'
card which the docs say won't ever be supports ;-)
I haven't seen this card supported in any of the 2.2.x or 2.3.x change lists
... so feel free to flame me if I've missed something...
Thanks,
Terry
