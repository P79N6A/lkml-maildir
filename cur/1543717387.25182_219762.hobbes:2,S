As one of the apparently 3 or 4 longtime users of Intermezzo, I like the
architecture, but the user-level utilities for manageing it (aka, for
resolving conflicts that occured during disconnected operation) just
aren't there, and nobody (including myself) has really had time to
devote to getting them in working shape.
I'd love to get my hands on Lustre version 2 and start beating up the
disconnected operation. If that's available in CVS somewhere, I'd vote
for rm -rf of intermezzo.

Somone asked my why I work on this free (

)
software stuff and not get a real job. Charles Shultz had the best answer:
"Why do musicians compose symphonies and poets write poems? They do it
because life wouldn't have any meaning for them if they didn't. That's why
I draw cartoons. It's my life." -- Charles Shultz
