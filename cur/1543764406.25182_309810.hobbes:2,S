Actually, we do not have to do an rbtree link and unlink for every
window we search.  If the reserved window(old) has no free bit and the
new reservable window's is right after the old one, no need to unlink
the old window from the rbtree and then link the new window, just update
the start and end of the old one. That's in the current designed
already, to reduce the cost of rbtree link and unlink.
