AFAICS, md.c also doesn't play nice with buffe cache.
        fsync_dev(dev);
        set_blocksize(dev, MD_SB_BYTES);
        bh = getblk(dev, sb_offset / MD_SB_BLOCKS, MD_SB_BYTES);
        if (!bh) {
                printk(GETBLK_FAILED, partition_name(dev));
                return 1;
        }
        memset(bh->b_data,0,bh->b_size);
        sb = (mdp_super_t *) bh->b_data;
        memcpy(sb, rdev->sb, MD_SB_BYTES);
        mark_buffer_uptodate(bh, 1);
        mark_buffer_dirty(bh);
        ll_rw_block(WRITE, 1, &bh);
        wait_on_buffer(bh);
        brelse(bh);
        fsync_dev(dev);
is not a good thing to do (write_disk_sb()).  Not to mention the fact that
set_blocksize() looks bogus, the code is obviously racy.  Think what will
happen if somebody is reading from device at that moment.
