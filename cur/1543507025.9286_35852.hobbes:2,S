Subject: [q] int __init init_module()?

Hello,
I noticed that some drivers (e.g. drivers/sound/cmpci.c) have a code like
this:
#ifdef MODULE
int __init init_module(void)
#else
int __init init_cmpci(void)
#endif
{
 ....
it makes sense to have __init in front of init_cmpci() but it seems rather
suspicious to have it for a module since the code for throwing away .init*
stuff is only called from free_initmem() on boot and does not seem to be
used on loading modules?
On the other hand, if it *is* needed for init_module() then plenty of
other places must be modified to have __init. So, in all cases, some
changes are required.
Regards,
Tigran.
