I don't know what the original patch looked like.  It doesn't
seem to have made it to any mailling lists to which I'm subscribed.
But I'm wondering of there is a bug in the shutdown routines for
the pit or the hpet that is causing problems.  As this is
a normal kexec those routines will get called.
