A little issue about "when is translation good"
I usually tell people to use vimtutor's example to set up syntax
highlighting in vim. I usually only install OSs in english because
translations tend to be poor and hard to comprehend.
Now, I'm from argentina, and I live with a lingüist. He doesn't handle
english very well, and he wanted to get rid of Windows, so we
installed ubuntu, Locale:SP_ARG.
vim is in spanish, and so is vimtutor. vimtutor's spanish translation
doesn't have anything on syntax highlighting: the translation is poor.
my point: IMHO it's better to have no translation than a poor one
