The VT82C686 is very different from other devices, because it is
a PCI chip, and its device number is determined by IDSEL wiring.
Google shows that several different assignments are in use:
00:01.0:

(but that's PPC)

00:07.0: this example and lots of other links

So this should probably be:
		/*
		 * 82C686 attaches to PCI and can have any device number, but
		 * all its subdevices are functions of that single device.
		 */
		via_vlink_dev_lo = via_vlink_dev_hi = PCI_SLOT(dev->devfn);
