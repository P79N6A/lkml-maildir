Hi al...
Since a discussion time ago, I know that accounting for threads is
broken in linux: getrusage does not give any info on children.
So I decided to do it by hand in my userspace app: each thread
tries to accout for itself, and parent sums up. But it looks like
getrusage called from a thread still gives the useless info about
the parent !!! Is this correct ? Any way to get accounting for a
thread itself, from the thread itself ?
(everytime I said thread, I meant _POSIX_ tread)
I am interested mainly in cpu (user/sys) accounting...
TIA
