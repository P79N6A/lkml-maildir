Thanks, Bart. Looks like it was set to 2.  I have set it to 1 and will build
it again.  I am trying to figure out why 2.4.4 (or to be more accurate
2.4.>1) dies on me when running in my web farm. This last time I tried
running top in the background with:
top -b -i -d10 >crap &
And it has run like a champ!  First time I have ever been able to run it
with good performance for more than 15 minutes.  Maybe I will  just
substitute /dev/null for crap and that will fix it :-/
