thanks, but I decided to begin from scratch(backup is available ;)
now, all partitions have the same size. creating a raid6 array from 2 drives and hot-adding another
one works now. so this could be regarded as solved.
But when I try to create the array with 3 drives at once, the following strange error appears:
flockmock ~ # mdadm --create /dev/md_d4 --level=6 -a mdp --chunk=32 -n 4 /dev/sda2 /dev/sdb2 
/dev/sdc2 missing
mdadm: RUN_ARRAY failed: Input/output error
mdadm: stopped /dev/md_d4
dmesg shows:

I just wanted to report that FYI, I will take the first route and wait a little...
cheers, florian
