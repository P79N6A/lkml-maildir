Actually, it seems that there are Lenovo ThinkCenter P4 machines with
buggy BIOSes that tell us that we can enable the APIC ... but doing so
eventually causes the system to hang.  Granted, the Google-recommended
fixes are "noapic" or "Update the BIOS", but perhaps it would be best to
leave it off _except_ for the few cases where we know that we need it.
(Then again, the correct solution in this case is to fix the BIOS...)
