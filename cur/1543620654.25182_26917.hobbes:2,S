What about BK CSET (or regular patch) submissions from non-core
developers?  Would you accept CSETs via email if they are preceeded
by a unified diff and explanation?  This would make it much easier
for any non-core developer to avoid having to re-sync their changes
with you if/when you accept that change into your tree.
Cheers, Andreas
