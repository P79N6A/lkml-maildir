Seems that -mm fails to compile when CONFIG_MODULES is set but
CONFIG_MODULE_UNLOAD is not.
   LD      .tmp_vmlinux1
  drivers/built-in.o(.text+0x47724): In function `scsi_device_put':
  drivers/scsi/scsi.c:887: undefined reference to `module_refcount'
Config fragment:
  CONFIG_MODULES=y
  # CONFIG_MODULE_UNLOAD is not set
  # CONFIG_MODULE_SRCVERSION_ALL is not set
This seems to be caused by changes in the scsi-misc git tree, from the
changes in the two commits below:
  [SCSI] sd: fix cache flushing on module removal
				(and individual device removal)
  [SCSI] fix up non-modular SCSI
  85b6c720b0931101c8bcc3a5abdc2b8514b0fb4b
  f479ab87936563a286b8aa0e39003c40fa31c6da
It looks very much like module_refcount is really not meant to be an
external interface, cirtainly its not available in all module
'load/unload modes'.
