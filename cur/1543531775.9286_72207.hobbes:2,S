Thanks for taking time to awnser this, you awnsered almost all my
questions. Even if the awnser was not the one I wanted to hear :)  I
realize that source-routed packets are a security concern, but had no idea
that anything except strict firewalls were blocking them.  I would still
like to test this out, do you still have a copy of that source route
enabled telnet sitting around?  I would love to get a copy.  Sounds like it
would be a decent tool to test if any routers are filtering packets with
the source-route flag set.

Yep, I wanted to be able to do this with applications I do not have the
source to.  eg.  windows boxes behind a linux masq server.
