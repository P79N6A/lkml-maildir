Btw, don't get me wrong. I don't think the above is really code that 
should survive, and if the compiler were to generate a warning for 
something like that, where the subscripts are clearly out of the range 
that they were in the declaration, then I'd be entirely supportive of 
that.
I don't know how we got side-tracked to negative subscripts. They are 
clearly legal with pointers, but that wasn't even the issue: the code that 
generated the "signed/unsigned" warning didn't use any negative 
subscripts, never had, and never will.
And unlike the abomination above, the code that generates the warning is 
the _clearest_ version of code you can humanly write. And THAT is the 
problem with the warning: there's no way to avoid the warning without 
making the source code _worse_ in some way.
And _that_ is what my argument really boils down to. Nothing else.
