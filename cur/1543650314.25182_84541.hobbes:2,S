I wrote in my mail "and the new mailinglist doesn't accept mail from
non-subscribers". This makes a mailing list entry IMHO pretty useless
since I try to Cc a mailing list listed in MAINTAINERS if possible when
sending a patch / bug report in this area. With a mailing list that
accepts only postings from subscribers such a mail bounces back.
The information how to subscribe to this list is available at the web page
also in this MAINTAINER entry.

I have no knowledge about who currently maintains IrDA. I did only notice
that an obsolete mailing list was listed in MAINTAINERS. If the
responsible person listed is wrong it should be corrected.
