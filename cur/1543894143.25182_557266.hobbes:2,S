Of course!  Okay now I'm begining to understand.

Why?  Wouldn't both paths be valid options?

I'm very interested in this.
 I'm not opposed to using struct page, but I'm confused as to how to
start that.  As I understand it, which is not well, defined a
CONFIG_DISCONTIGMEM region to cover the Flash memory would add that to
my pool of RAM.  That would be 'bad', right?  I don't see how to
create the page structs and set this memory aside as different.
