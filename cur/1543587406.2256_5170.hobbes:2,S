I have an AMD K6/2-400. But I do know _many_ people who do own slower
Hardware, and run Linux on it. They do not want and cannot afford to buy
the newest shiny box. And, they have better things to do with their time
as well. Please note, I live in a country where people are not _poor_.
Just think of others some time, not only of yourself. 
So long,
Jochen Striepe.
