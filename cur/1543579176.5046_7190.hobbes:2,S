well, i know there's a problem with the via apollo pro 133a chipset,
smp, apic, and usb.  it looks like the usb driver (usb-uhci) doesn't
receive any interrupts if apic is enabled.  if you disable apic from the
lilo prompt with "noapic", then it'll all work (of course, without
apic).  
according to the linux-usb maintainers, it's a pci irq routing problem.
i've asked jeff garzik and martin mares if they'll look into it, but
they're pretty busy and i haven't heard anything back from them (not
that'd i'd expect to for quite a while, considering their load).  i've
asked on the list too, but i've only heard back from people with the
same problem, not anyone who can fix the problem.
i've pretty much got the same system as you, except for the ultra66
promise card.
