FWIW, find(1) does *not* stat non-directories (and neither would this
approach).  So it's just dentries for directories and you can't realistically
skip those.  OK, you could - if you had banned cross-directory rename
for directories and propagated "dirty since last look" towards root (note
that it would be a boolean, not a timestamp).  Then we could skip unchanged
subtrees completely...
