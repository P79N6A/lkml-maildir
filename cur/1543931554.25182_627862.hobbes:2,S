Thanks, that answered my question.

No, what I was thinking of kernel code like
static int fooxxxvar = 0;
static int __read_mostly fooyyyvar = 0;
void mytest()
{
        if (fooxxxvar)
                printk("fooxxx");
        if (fooyyyvar)
                printk("fooyyy");
}
If you run "strings file.c | grep foo" on the file it will only return
"fooyyy" but not "fooxxx".
It's not a big deal, but it's an area where __read_mostly affects gcc 
and not ld.
