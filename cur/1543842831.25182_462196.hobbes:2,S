Ok, so we would define ordering on the first and last accesses (being
the first and last in ascending addresses order) and leave it free to
the implementation to do what it wants in between. Is that ok ?

If we consider cacheable accesses, we need to also provide cache
flushing primitives as MMIO devices are generally not coherent. Take for
example the case of the frame buffer: you may want to upload a texture,
and later use it with the engine. You need a way in between to make sure
all the cached dirty lines have been pushed to the device before you
start the engine. Since we provide no generically useable functions for
doing such cache coherency on MMIO space, I'd rather keep usage of MMIO
accessors on cacheable storage non-defined. That is add a simple note at
the top of the file that the rules defined here only apply to
non-cacheable mappings. Is that ok ?

Well, there is no clear existing semantics, at least not global to all
archs for cacheable access to MMIO so yeah, let's say that ordering on
cacheable storage is left undefined :)
