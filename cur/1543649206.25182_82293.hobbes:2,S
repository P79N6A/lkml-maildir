Yes, that's what I was proposing.

Hah!  Very good point.  Seems we need to think again.

Well, yes, but that's not the issue as I understand it.  There you're
thinking of contention on the spinlock, and its effect spreading to
the data protected by that lock.  Whereas the more pernicious effect
of cacheline bouncing is when there is no particular contention on
a spinlock, but data is (mis)distributed in such a way that mods to
the same cacheline are likely to occur from different cpus at at about
the same time.
In the original design, Mingming nicely split up the locks (greatly
reducing contention), but had them in an array (causing lots of bounce,
I believe): I'm resisting a return to that design.
