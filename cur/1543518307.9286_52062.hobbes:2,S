Your ability for discussions are deteriorating.  How can you compare
a.out-style shared objects with ELF?  Of course it has higher costs,
but this is fix the problems of the old implementation.  You will
always have a bit higher costs, even in the best case.

Yes,
- but your syscall stuff has nothing at all to do with this.  You are
  now back to bitching about startup time and the usual complains about
  the libc quality.
- and I'm already working (for some time) on changes to improve the
  startup costs where you will only use the current mechanisms if
  you are preloading or replace libraries.  But to implement this I
  have to start from ground up which means rewriting binutils and this
  takes time.  In the end you'll never see relocations being performed
  unless you are preloading/changing libraries (where the situtation in
  the later case can be rectified).
