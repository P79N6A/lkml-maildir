There are other statically allocated devices in tree[1]. It seems this
is actively discouraged, though.
AFAICT, the platform_bus device is there for a similar reason to ours -
i.e. to group devices together in sysfs.

I choose to keep it because:
  a) I'm trying to fix the warning spew from 'rmmod virtio_pci' without 
     breaking anything else
  b) The grouping under /sys/devices/{virtio-pci,lguest,kvm_s390} is
     useful IMHO and there are precedents (e.g. /sys/devices/platform)
  c) It's better to not gratuitously move stuff around where we know it 
     will break something

Being discussed elsewhere in the thread.
Cheers,
