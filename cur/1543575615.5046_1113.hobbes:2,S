Just one comment.  You cannot use a kernel build to measure
other things than those subsystems which the kernel build
excercises.
Things you could measure with a kernel build:  scheduling (L2
cache efficiency), fork, readahead, cpu speed, framebuffer
speed (in the make dep phase) and maybe hard disk speed.
Things you cannot measure with a kernel build: networking,
swapping (unless you do a very big parallel build, and even
then it's questionable), raw IO speed (the kernel build is
latency sensitive, but doesn't need much throughput), ...
regards,
Rik
