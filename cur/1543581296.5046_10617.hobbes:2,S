Subject: [PATCH] 2.4.1-ac7: NTFS further cleanups + docs updates
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Alan,
Please apply attached patch for the next ac release (it is gzipped to
ensure integrity of white space and it's also smaller that way).
Have tested it to compile both as module and in kernel and tested
functionality when compiled in. - Tests are fine.
Note I consider this patch fully stable (only obvious bugfixes, and each
has been tested).
Detailed description of updates:
Documentation/filesystems/ntfs.txt and Documentation/Configure.help: 
update adding references to ntfsfix utility (me)
Remainders only touch fs/ntfs/ files:
Remove remaining userspace tools support #ifdefs; final offset fix for
layout_runs(); misc cleanups. (Yuri Per <yuri@acronis.com>)
Add return code + checking to ntfs_insert_mft_attributes(); small
cleanups. (Rob Radez <rob@osinvestor.com>)
Check and return error if unsupported blocksize, rather than panic the
kernel; Correctly handle all index_clusters_per_record values; Add
docbook style documentation to a few ntfs functions and other comments
updates (docs are the preparation for the next patch I will submit which
contains most of the documented functions either cleaned up or rewritten); 
misc cleanups. (me)
Best regards,
	Anton
