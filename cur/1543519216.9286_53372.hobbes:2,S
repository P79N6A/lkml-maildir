You are right about the idea of not breaking a concept. Its true I
shouldn't break a standard concept to do what a single driver/project
wants done. If this was the case their would be no standards. Egg on my
face :(

This is the idea I will work on. The main point of the last email to 
point out what I was trying to do. Ensure a page fault for each access to 
accel engine whether it be by a thread or a forked process. Also
avoid having to do a massive rewrite of threaded OpenGL. If their is
another way besides private mapping that acceptable by everyone and gives
just as good or better performace then I will use that method.

No. I'm willing to listen to suggestion by you and the other parties have
here. Otherwise I wouldn't have posted to this mailing list. When
it comes to ideas how often does someone else come up with a even
better idea. I see your point about keeping standards and I will stick by 
them.
