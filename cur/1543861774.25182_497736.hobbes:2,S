The SATA drivers have seen /hundreds/ of changes since your kernel was 
released, and the problem you describe is a symptom of /multiple/ 
problems that were fixed in the following kernels.
It's unfortunately your task, and the task of the 2.6.16.* maintainer, 
to track this down further if you care.  Most developers concentrate on 
the current kernel, otherwise we wind up fixing the same bugs over and 
over again.
That's what distros pay people to do, care about older kernels...
