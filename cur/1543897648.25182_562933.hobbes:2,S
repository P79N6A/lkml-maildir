Indeed. At least the IDE CD-ROM driver does
	if ((rq->data_len & 15) || (addr & mask))
		info->dma = 0;
where the "mask" is the dma_alignment mask. So it requires the length to 
be a multiple of 16, and also requires a certain alignment of the data 
(which defaults to 32 bytes for some reason I cannot for the life of me 
remember).
The generic BIO layer does that DMA alignment check too when mapping user 
pages.
