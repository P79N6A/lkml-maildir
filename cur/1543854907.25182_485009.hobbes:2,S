Suggested time of removal: one year after two relevant software
package releases get updated:
  - NTPD, to call hwclock specifying the relevant RTC;
  - util-linux, updating hwclock to know about /dev/rtcN;
  - busybox, with its own hwclock implementation.
The util-linux hwclock update is already in the queue, I'm told.
