Correct. And infact that's what is happening to 2.4.0-test8.

No, I wasn't suggesting anything like that, I was only saying "don't complain
the elevator if the number you got out of test8 aren't good and you were
running on scsi". I guess the latency defaults are been set to a too high
default value exactly to be able to say that :). Jens also verified that a
default of 250 and 500 is good enough to not degenerate the tiotest numbers
(tested on 2.2.17 + elv-simple-1 patch), and with a 250/500 pair a `find` with
a `cp /dev/zero .` in background is not too bad (not like an deadlock and you
can visibly see the fix in action, however you'll definitely notice the cp in
background :).
