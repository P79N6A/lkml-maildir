I find that if I log in over the net and kill gpm, I get back mouse and
keyboard.  Its only locked up when the mouse device is open.  If I disable gpm
altogether then it works fine (but I can't start X).  It only seems to be an
issue when something else is sharing IRQ 12 with the PS/2 mouse; if I manage to
put everything else (PCMCIA, USB) on other IRQs then I have no problems with
the mouse.
