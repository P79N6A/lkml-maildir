eventually the discovery will end with a call into userspace, it'd be
enough to wait4 and wakeup a waitqueue when the wait4 returns.

the kernel certainly knows when it's about time to fork an userspace
process to create the device, doesn't it? then just wait4 while the
process is running.

if you intentionally don't want to provide serialization and force into
/var/run locking, that's fine with me, but I don't buy your claim that
it's not feasible.
