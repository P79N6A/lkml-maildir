Priority Inversion is **BAD BUSINESS**.  Someone whould fix whatever this
person is complaining about.  I agree that priority inheritance is slow and
makes for **FAT** sync object code, but it's either this or throw priorities
out of the window in the kernel proper since we will see **LOTS** of
deadlocks and busted applications if an inversion model is what we end up
with.
