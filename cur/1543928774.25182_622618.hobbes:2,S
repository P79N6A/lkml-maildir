Chuck seems to have caught a bug, although the wrong one:

This is correct.
But the ones that do the same thing for fs/es/ds are *not*. Those three 
registers are kernel mode registers (ds/es are the regular kernel data 
segment, fs is the per-cpu data segment), and restored on return to user 
space from the stack.
For similar reasons, this is wrong:

That %fs is the kernel per-cpu thing, not the user %fs.
But this one is correct:

No, %gs is untouched by the kernel, so it contains user space version, and 
getting the value directly from %gs looks correct.
