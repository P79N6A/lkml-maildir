(Adding myself to this thread...)
I've tested this on x86_64 now (the prior patch failed on brk, as
mentioned).  This version passes my regression tests.  I'd like to
double-check this on i386 with unlimited stack (the situation that ran
into problems back with 2.6.20's version of text ASLR).
For anyone interested, I have a few ASLR and VM checking tools here:

Thanks,
