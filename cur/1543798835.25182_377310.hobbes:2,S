And we catch this type of problems fairly easily in the patch review  
itself, even before accepting the code in mainline. Plus there is  
make checkstack to help find and fix any such issues, isn't it? So  
it's not like forcing the stack to 4Kb and making the offending code  
to crash is the best solution to force people to write code which  
plays nice with the stack.
I think on i386 most people do fine with the 8Kb stack - whoever  
benefits from 4Kb stack, can always choose the 4Kb stack config  
option and recompile.
Alternatively, default to 4Kb and let people choose 8Kb and recompile  
if that's what suits their workloads.
In any case having options doesn't hurt anything and we don't benefit  
in any way from taking away the 8Kb option.
My 2 cents.
