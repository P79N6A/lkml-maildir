I'm not even sure, its an old vaio pII 512MZ. Still works like a charm
with Linux. I use a chokoloku usb dangle that I dismantled and assembled
inside the laptop case. I use the original windows drivers that came with
it.
Last time I checked with 2.6.20 it did not work, but I should now try
2.6.24 as I know things have advanced a lot. (It works and I'm just lazy)

Thank you, I do support what you are doing here. Just the ndiswrapper
is a special case. But I guess I, as a user, can always use it anyway,
right? But not the commercial distros. Don't stop the transition on my
account.
