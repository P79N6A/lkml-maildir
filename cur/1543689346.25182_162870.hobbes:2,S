In message <Pine.LNX.4.44.0309031201170.31853-100000@home.osdl.org> you write:

Right, so it would be consistent for someone doing a FUTEX_WAIT on an
"intact" (not broken by COW) private mapping to see a FUTEX_WAKE done
on that file.
However, Jamie's futex code will see !VM_SHARED on the mapping, and
compare futexes by mm + uaddr (rather than inode + file offset), so
this is NOT the case.  Using VM_MAYSHARE instead would make the
MAP_SHARED readonly case work as above, though.
The way futexes are used now, they're both "don't care".  If you have
a private mapping or read-only mapping, you'll never get woken by
others with the same file mapped writable shared, but WTF were you
waiting for a futex if the mapping is private anyway: the lock
acquisition won't work (and sleeping forever is easier to debug than
two tasks getting the lock).
Oh no, I think I'm starting to understand the VM a little.
Ick.
