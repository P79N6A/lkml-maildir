I use this:
UUID=35963d32-f15e-497e-859a-ed1cb366b0f3 / ext3 defaults        0       1
No problem with fsck or anything on my debian system.  I had problems
trying to use LABELs but UUID always worked when I tried it.  Back under
sarge I had problems getting it to work though.
Works much better than trying to use disk names, since I have 3
different IDE controllers and the modules seem to never quite initialize
in the same order every time from the initramfs.
