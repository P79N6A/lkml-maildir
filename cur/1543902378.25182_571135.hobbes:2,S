_changing_ it is an option within reason, and we've done it a couple of 
times already in the past, and even within CFS (as Peter correctly 
observed) we've been through a couple of iterations already. And as i 
mentioned it before, the outer edge of nice levels (+19, by far the most 
commonly used nice level) was inconsistent to begin with: 3%, 5%, 9% of 
nice-0, depending on HZ. So changing that to a consistent (and 
user-requested) 1.5% is a much smaller change than you seem to make it 
out to be. CFS itself is a far larger "change of expectations" than this 
tweak to nice levels. So by your standard we could never change the 
scheduler. (which your ultimate argument might be after all =B-)
