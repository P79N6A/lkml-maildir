This funny macro gets away without any extra headers or #ifdef messiness:
#define merge_64(r1,r2)							\
({									\
	union {								\
		int __words[2];						\
		long long	__dword;				\
	} __u = {							\
		.__words = { (r1), (r2) }				\
	};								\
									\
	__u.__dword;							\
})
Thanks to gcc doing bogus sign and zero extensions it compiles into
slightly larger code for MIPS but that may not be an issue on other
architectures.
