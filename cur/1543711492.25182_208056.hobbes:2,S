I'm not an asm expert, so could you explain how it corrupts the FPU
context?  I tried to save off the value of the XMM register I used,
and the docs I have say that the movq and movdq instructions don't
affect any flags.
As far as the CPUID, you're right... I left that part of the code out
but I am definitely planning on using this only if the machine has SSE2.

Hmm, they save cr0 and do a clts, and then restore cr0 when they're
done.  For my education, can you explain why?

OK, thanks.
