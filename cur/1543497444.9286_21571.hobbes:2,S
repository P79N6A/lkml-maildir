Hi !
I'm trying to make a big firewall with a linux box (Dell PowerEdge 2300 -
One PII 400 - 128M RAM).
The main problem is a boot (tulip driver is linked into the kernel) I've
got this output :
Jun  2 11:32:33 pc-xb kernel:   Enabling bus-master transmits and whole-frame receives. 
Jun  2 11:32:33 pc-xb kernel: tulip.c:v0.89H 5/23/98 becker@cesdis.gsfc.nasa.gov

Jun  2 11:32:33 pc-xb kernel: eth2: ***WARNING***: No MII transceiver found! 
Even if my card is connected to the network hub (100Mbit or 10Mbit) the
link led doesn't light and ifconfig eth1 up doesn't help...
Any hints about this problem ?
