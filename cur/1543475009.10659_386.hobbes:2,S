Hi all.
I'm having very persistent trouble using the standard sound drivers, I
suspect a hardware glitch, either in the soundcard or in the mainboard
chipset. 
The computer randomly hangs solid when it completes playing a sound file,
probably when releasing the sound device. The only thing I can do when
this occurs is cycle the power or press the reset button. (This happens in
all OS's I've tried as well, Linux/MS-DOS/several windoze versions - so
probably a hardware problem)
This is probably a hardware problem. But if a software workaround is
possible, this list probably is the place to go for help.
Hardware:
Old Hyundai ISA-only 486 mainboard, w/VIA VT82C480 chipset...
  (this machine was low-end when I bought it in '94 :-)
SoundBlaster 16 Value (firmware 4.11) at 
	IO - 0x220, IRQ - 7, DMA - 1, DMA16bit - 5
Alan? I recently saw you saying something on the list to a guy who seemed
to have the same problem... suggestions? Maybe VIA has been buggy for a
longer time than we thought?
I've tried changing IRQ's, to no avail. Running the system for a long time
without any sound driver and watching for use of DMA 1 and/or 5 by other
cards has gone to no avail. And there is no problem with I/O 0x220, as far
as I can ascertain.
(I talked to a guy who had the same chipset+soundblaster combination ...
he solved his problem by buying a cheap soundblaster-clone... wimp's way
out *grin*)
