Make sure you can reproduce this with modutils-2.3.12
If you are using an older version and cannot reproduce that many
unresolved symbols after the upgrade, Documentation/Changes should be
amended to require modutils-2.3.12
I think this should be done anyways, since modutils-2.3.12 fixes support
for /etc/modules.devfs when called from devfsd.
Also, given the scale of hassle that people have building Linux with old
modutils, a sanity check could be added the the top-level makefile to
ensure that the required version of modultils is installed when modules
are about to be built.

Pavel Roskin
