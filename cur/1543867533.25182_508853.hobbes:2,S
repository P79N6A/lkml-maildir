Signal context is another thing that we need to transfer to the 
return-to-userspace task, in case we switch. Async threads inherit that 
from the "main" task once they're created, but from there to the 
sys_async_exec syscall, userspace might have changed the signal context, 
and re-emerging with a different one is not an option ;)
We should setup service-threds signal context, so that we can cancel them, 
but the implementation should be hidden to userspace (that will use 
sys_async_cancel - or whatever name -  to do that).
