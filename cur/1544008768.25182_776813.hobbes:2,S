First of all thanks for your reply! Would be nice to have an FAQ with
all the errors and the most common causes somewhere...

this I would exclude (as I cannot trigger the problem by increasing load
while writing to the 4 disks in the machine)

might have been the problem in this case.

the controller should be OK as it was working with another drive.
But as the problem only appeared once and I did all kinds of tests in
the last two days without this problem to re-appear I guess it must have
been either:
a) hot plug attempt with first only having a 1.5Gps drive in the
backplane
b) the connection was somehow flaky between drive and backplane (drive
was not inserted properly - still strange that it took >8 hrs to trigger
the problem).
I will keep an eye on it, but I don't expect the problem to re-appear -
but having had bad experiences with all kinds of controller/disk setups
and reading about the seagate firmware bug in earlier firmware revisions
of this drive made me alert..
So sorry for the noise and thanks for the helpful response!
