What's the difference between "built in" and "on the PCI bus"? Both 
types are physically a part of the mainboard, and need to be quirked, right?
The corner case I was referring to is where someone plugs an *external* 
VIA-based PCI card into a PCI slot on a VIA motherboard. In that case, 
the PCI card gets quirked too, when it didn't need to be, and this may 
or may not cause problems...

I don't know much about PCI. How can I detect this?
Alternatively if you (or anyone else who knows PCI) wants to write a new 
patch or modify the existing one I would have no objections. I can also 
get a few people to test it.
Thanks.
Daniel
