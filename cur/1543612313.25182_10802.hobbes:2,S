The details were a bit different in that web page:
Linux looks for chip with id 1106:0305 (KT133) and clears only bit 7 of
register 55. The Windows driver checks for chips 1106:0305, 1106:3099,
1106:3102, 1106:3112, and clears three bits: bits 5-7 of that register. In
addition, the web page tells that it's probably not right for 1106:3099
(KT266) because there it should be register 95.
Maybe this is not relevant: maybe all BIOSes for KT266 chipsets already set
the right values and maybe KT133 boards with problems only have bit 7 set,
not bits 5 and 6. (PCs here with KT133 already have all bits 5-7 zero in
reg. 55 and PCs with KT266 have bits 5-7 both in reg. 55 and 95 zero.)
