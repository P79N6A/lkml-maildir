Was the machine swapping a lot? As worse the kernel should kill your
processes and not die completly though... My patch that revert to
shrink_mmap after one succsfully swapout if low on memory should help to
avoid killing of processes. Are you sure it's been a total lockup? Did you
tried ping via network? Maybe X crashed and your console gone away ;).
