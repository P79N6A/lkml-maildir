Suppose now to have a convention that control stream are in the form:
"ACTION ARGUMENTS"
Then we have
echo "speed 19200" > /proc/self/fd/0/ioctl
instead of
stty 19200
It seems to me something different from a pile of shit ;-)
And it may works also via NFS (with some changes).

This is orthogonal wrt ioctl problems pointed by Linus.
I've simply proposed an *infrastructure* for better interfaces.
