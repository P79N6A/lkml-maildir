This is mine and although it's a 'real' problem, it is something that's easy to 
hack around by having the suspend script turn on smart after it is resumed. (Of 
course I can't use resume until a skge wol bug is fixed so I won't see/test this 
unless asked too.)
The smart init scripts run '-s on' when the system boots anyway for my system - 
this problem only occurs for me during suspend/resume. Maybe smartd should 
detect that as Alan says.
Please let me know if there's anything else you need.
David
