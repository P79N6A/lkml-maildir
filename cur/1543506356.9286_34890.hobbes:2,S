Ah yes, if readpage() leaves the page locked? I wasn't sure what other
implementations did (block_read_full_page doesn't ever fail), and I was too
lazy to check ;-)

nfs/read.c:nfs_readpage() doesn't seem to. Do we fix it, or try to handle this
in filemap_nopage? Ack, smb_readpage is weird, too -- it seems to expect the
page /not/ to be locked. Am I right in thinking that smbfs hasn't been
sanitised since the "Great Overhaul"?

Okay, that makes sense. New patch (untested, but 'obviously' correct.. again):

Yup, I have a Cheapbytes Debian 2.1R2 CD with a few suitably buggered files.
grep'ing them triggers the above problem quite nicely.
