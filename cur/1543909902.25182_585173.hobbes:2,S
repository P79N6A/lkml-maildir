We use atomic_t for data that is concurrently locklessly written and
read at arbitrary times.  My naive expectation as driver author (driver
maintainer) is that all atomic_t accessors, including atomic_read, (and
atomic bitops) work with the then current value of the atomic data.

The only code I somewhat know, the ieee1394 subsystem, was perhaps
authored and is currently maintained with the expectation that each
occurrence of atomic_read actually results in a load operation, i.e. is
not optimized away.  This means all atomic_t (bus generation, packet and
buffer refcounts, and some other state variables)* and likewise all
atomic bitops in that subsystem.
If that assumption is wrong, then what is the API or language primitive
to force a load operation to occur?
*)  Interesting what a quick LXR session in search for all atomic_t
usages in 'my' subsystem brings to light.  I now noticed an apparently
unused struct member in the bitrotting pcilynx driver, and more
importantly, a pairing of two atomic_t variables in raw1394 that should
be audited for race conditions and for possible replacement by plain int.
