I use an Advansys controller for an old, slow SCSI drive and my flatbed 
scanner. I noticed that upon trying to boot 2.6.16, my Advansys controller 
wasn't detected. Further investigation shows that the driver has been 
fairly silently disappearing over the last couple releases.
Is this a permanent change or is the Advansys driver just in need of some 
updating to current APIs? I'd hate to have to replace this controller and 
I don't want to be stuck at 2.6.15 forever. If someone could point me in 
the right direction about what the problem is, I'd be glad to take a look 
at seeing if I could fix it.
