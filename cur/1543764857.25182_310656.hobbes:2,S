It's based on Title 17 USC, Sec. 101, where "derivative work" is defined:
A “derivative work” is a work based upon one or more preexisting works,
such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization,
fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art
reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which a
work may be recast, transformed, or adapted. A work consisting of
editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
which, as a whole, represent an ORIGINAL WORK OF AUTHORSHIP, is a
“derivative work”. (emphasis added)
