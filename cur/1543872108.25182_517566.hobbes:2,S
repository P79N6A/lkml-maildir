There are a total of 10 Linux Integrity Module(LIM) hooks. Seven of
which parallel the LSM hooks, out of the ~150 LSM hooks.  3 of the LIM
hooks are for initializing, allocating, and freeing the inode-
>i_integrity, used for caching integrity information.  As the integrity
information is stored as extended attributes, 2 hooks are for catching
changes to the extended attributes, one is for updating the extended
attributes when the file closes, and d_instantiate is used for
initialization.  Is this excessive?  How else would you design
integrity, without using the LSM hooks?
