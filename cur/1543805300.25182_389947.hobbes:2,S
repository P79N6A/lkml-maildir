I think I have finally found the bug
after auditing the patch for x times...
+       /* Stop DMA, if doing DMA */
+       switch (qc->tf.protocol) {
+       case ATA_PROT_DMA:
+       case ATA_PROT_ATAPI_DMA:
+               ata_bmdma_stop(qc);
It should be sil_bmdma_stop()...
By accident ata_bmdma_stop() is OK for sil3112 so that would
explain why only people with sil3114 reported problems.
My theory is that using ata_bmdma_stop() for sil3114 results
in IRQs for port 2 and 3 not being delivered (because
SIL_INTR_STEERING bit is cleared) and we end up with
dma_stat_mask == 0.
Rest of the patch looks perfectly fine for me.  Could somebody
reporting problems with this patch retest with the above change?
+               break;
+       default:
+               /* do nothing */
+               break;
+       }
