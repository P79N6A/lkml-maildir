Yes. The series already has the patches to move the SLB miss handler
into the built-in parts. At the moment, we also need the symbols for
the context switch code that also touches the SLB entries. We already
have a patch to move that as well, but are still discussing the details
of that.
I'll follow up with a patch to replace this one.
