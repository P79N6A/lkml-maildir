CLONE_FS unset for unshare doesn't mean that share the fs_struct with
others. It just means that you leave the fs_struct alone (which may or
maynot be shared). I agree that it is confusing, but I am having difficulty
in seeing this reversal of flag meaning. clone creates a second task and
allows you to pick what you want to share with the parent. unshare allows
you to pick what you don't want to share anymore. The "what" in both
cases can be same and still you can end up with a task with "share" state
for a perticular structure. For example, if we #define  FS   CLONE_FS,
then clone(FS) will imply that you want to share fs_struct but unshare(FS)
will imply that we want to unshare fs_struct. Does it still appear that
the flag meaning has changed? clone and unshare are doing different
things, the flag just indicates the structure on which they operate.

I disagree. You cannot start sharing with this system call. You can
only unshare a shared structure. If you don't specify a flag corresponding
to a structure, that structure stays in its current state which may be
shared or unshared. Since the only action you can perform with this
call is unshare, unshare is the more appropriate name.

umm.. I am not sure how you were thinking of refactoring it, but my 
attempt at
using copy_* functions introduced race conditions.
