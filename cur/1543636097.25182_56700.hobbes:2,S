It would still require a totally pathetic loop setup. More than 2 or 3
stacked loop devices that are not using remapping would crawl
performance wise. Now make that eg 32 "indirections" (allocations and
copies on _each_ i/o), and I think you'll find that the system would be
impossible to use long before this theoretical dead lock would be hit.
