Subject: Why is the kernel complaining about large SCSI LUNs

I am running kernel 2.6.9 on an Opteron box with an LSI 320 card and 
am seeing the following message repeatedly in dmesg:
scsi: host 1 channel 0 id 0 lun 0x5a5a5a5a5a5a5a5a has a LUN larger 
than currently supported.
Is this just cosmetic or there is a bug somewhere? It appears that 
scsi_scan.c has logic where this message is actually valid, but how 
can that be?
