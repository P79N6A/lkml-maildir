Excuse my ignorance, but does this ensure that there's concensus among
the nodes about this membership?

OK, I agree with this. As long as the CMAN itself doesn't care about
this either but just reports it to the cluster, that's fine.

I doubt it can be entirely independent; or how do you implement lock

It sounds useful enough even for our work, given appropriate
notification of fencing events; instead of scheduling a fencing event,
we'd need to make sure that the node joins a fencing domain and later
block until receiving a notification. It's not as fine grained, but our
approach (based on the dependencies of the resources managed, basically)
might have been more fine grained than required in a typical
environment.
Yes, I can see how that could be made to work.
