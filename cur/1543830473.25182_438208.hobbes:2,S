Again, virtual devices that are no associated with any driver.  Exactly
the situation we have today with the usb endpoints and the usb_device
structures. 
And again, the USB core should not be messing with any devices that it
does not control, that just happen to be hanging off of the USB devices.

No they don't.  If they did, they would be bound to a driver and provide
a suspend method.  Look at the current code for 2 examples of struct
devices that meet this critera.

Well, who knows what the original point of the driver model was in this
regard, as that developer is not helping with development anymore :(

If we want to add these kinds of constraints to the driver model, great,
let's add them to the core and have that discussion.  But we should NOT
be adding it to a random driver subsystem to try to enforce requirements
the rest of the driver tree does not obey.  That's just insane.
