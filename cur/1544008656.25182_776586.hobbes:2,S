Subject: [PATCH v2 0/4] sched: track next-highest priority
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Hi Ingo,
  This version of the patches is logically equivelent to v1 with the following
  exceptions.
1) Rebased to tip/master df9fc0207
2) split v1-1/3 into v2-1/4 (cleanup) and v2-2/4 (changes)
I talked to Peter today about reviewing/acking these.  I told him to wait for
v2, so here it is.  Hopefully he will have a chance to look at these soon.
Thanks guys,
-Greg
