Hi,
I'm confused about reading and then writing files (say for ext2).
Suppose we first read block 1 in a file. Generic_readpage adds the data
to the inode page cache using brw_page.  It uses some temporary
buffers that are not hashed.
Assume that next we want to write in block 1, then ext2_getblk, calls
inode_getblk, which calls getblk, and, unless I'm mistaken, we go back
to the _disk_ to read the block.  
My confusion is about the following: why can't we share page cache
data with the buffer cache, eliminating the extra i/o?
The converse, first writing and then reading seems to be fine, since
brw_page (which would be invoked by the read after the write) first checks
the buffer cache.
Surely I'm missing something.  Thanks for the explanation!
