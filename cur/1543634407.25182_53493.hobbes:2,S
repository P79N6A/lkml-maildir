Actually, was deliberate.  Not exposing the mask when almost everyone
just wants to know "are any of these cpus online" was a preemptive strike
against NR_CPUS > BITS_PER_LONG (I wouldn't have bothered but I was so
close anyway).
My mistake was not noticing that x86 SMP was still exposing it and that
scheduler changes since my original patch were using it.  Fixed with
cpu_online_mask(res, mask) in prior patch.
Apologies, and hope that clarifies,
Rusty.
