Ok. The sparc code has not been modified; something weird is going on. (By
the way, the Sparc code could use some design improvement, as a special
exception, the Sparc does backcalculation and it is hacky implemented).

What is the default video mode on your sparc? Could the value that is
read be CRTC_PIX_WIDTH_4BPP or CRTC_PIX_WIDTH_16BPP? (Atyfb does only
support 8, 15, 24 and 32 bpp)
The code that calls aty_crtc_to_var has been changed a bit to accomodate
lcd mode calculations. It could be that it is called while the default
video mode on sparc is still active. This should not harm, since the
display is set to 640x480, 8bpp afterwards.

Ok, pll register 2 is PLL_REV_DIV (perhaps this code should use the
constants). It cannot be zero, otherwise the chip will malfunction.
So I think it must be because of a malfunction of aty_ld_pll.

Quite likely. I'm going to send you a few modifications, we'll see if they
do something.
