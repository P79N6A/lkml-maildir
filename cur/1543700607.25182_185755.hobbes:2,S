Yep,
sched_balance_wake wakes to idle siblings if your domain has SD_FLAG_WAKE
and idle_balance tries pulling tasks from any domain with SD_FLAG_NEWIDLE
set if we're just about to become idle.

I reworked things to not require this hopefully. w26 was quite broken
with respect to the active balancing stuff. One thing I did in w27 was
accidently release the code with cache_hot_time for the SMT domain set
to 1ms instead of 0 in w26, so SD_FLAG_NEWIDLE is sometimes not allowed
to pull a ready-to-run task off a sibling...
I haven't been able to do a great deal of performance tuning though,
there is probably quite a bit of room for improvement.
