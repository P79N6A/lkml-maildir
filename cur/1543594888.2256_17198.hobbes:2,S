Why doesn't the VM hang the syncing of queued IO on these guys via
wait_event or such instead of trying to just let the allocation fail?
(which seems to me will only cause the allocation to be resubmitted,
effectively changing nothing but adding overhead)  Does failing the
allocation in fact accomplish more than what I'm (uhoh:) assuming?
