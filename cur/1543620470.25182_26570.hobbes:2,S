This is not necessarily true for read requests.
If each read request is synchronous and the process will
generate the next read request after the current one
has finished, then it's quite possible to clog up the
queue with read requests which are generated at exactly
the same rate as they're processed.
Couldn't this still cause starvation, even with your patch?

Rik
