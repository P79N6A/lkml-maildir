And I was about to say before I clicked "send".. can't we do something like
writing all ff's into the BAR at the same time as we clear res->start ? Isn't
that supposed to pretty much disable decoding on that BAR ? Or not... Probably
still better than leaving it to whatever dangling value it had no ?
Also, maybe we should disable IO and MEM decoding by default on devices for
which one resource of that type failed to allocate ?
