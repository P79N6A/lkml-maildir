Could you send me the code you want me to test, I'd don't know enough
asm to move the stack.  I tried replacing the line with the comment
about the ASUS board private stack with a line like, "mov $0x200,
%sp", but I don't understand it.
As for check about the push alone causing the reboot, I removed the
pop, and it still reboots, but to me that doesn't say that it's the
push that does it.  It could be the next line.  I'll try to put in an
infinite loop.
Thanks,
Jason
