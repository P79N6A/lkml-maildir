It should be perfectly safe.
The Geode has significantly more than dumb frame buffer support, even
though it can't support 3D in hardware (we do get blit and alpha
blending, and YUV->RGB support in hardware).
We have an fbdev driver for the hardware (in fact, have to finally have
a decent driver in general, as the transfer to and from DCON controlled
display has to happen at interrupt time).  We won't be doing thing evil
in X behind the operating system's back the way most XF86 drivers do,
but very much the way display drivers supported X before the strange
notion of completely OS independent drivers without any kernel support
twisted the way XF86 drivers usually work.  Ah, back to the future
(past)....
