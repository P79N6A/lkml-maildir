Minor versions won't help you.  Different minor versions try to stay
interface-compatible with each other.  But data structures not
exposed to interfaces can still be rewritten completely.
Lots of nice ideas and implementations have piled up for 2.5.  Those
who proves immensely successfull in 2.5 may get backported to 2.4
once they get enough testing.  Try reading a few months worth of
kernel patches and you'll see that things change in stable kernels
too.
