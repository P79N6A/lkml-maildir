Windows 98 and possibly followons doesn't quite honor 'b' type
partitions in the extended area of the disk, particularily if you are
past the 8gig boundary and the partitions in question are over 2gig.
The above numbers are NOT hard boundaries, I have only seen this on 2
computers and those numbers are approximate.
Generally, I have to use partition magic to make partitions past that
point if I don't want windows to scribble all over my other
partitions.
This is quite a nightmare, and not all that easy to diagnose or fix.
