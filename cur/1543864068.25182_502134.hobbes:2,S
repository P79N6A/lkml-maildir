as i understand it, it's not supposed to.  it was explained to me once
that those defconfigs are regularly rebuilt, and will lose that
reference automatically once there's no corresponding kernel config
variable anymore.
someone care to clarify this?  because i remember distinctly once upon
a time being told *not* to mess with any defconfig files in a patch.
