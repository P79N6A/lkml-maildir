Just for kicks, do whatever is necessary to "break" the fpu. Then run
this program:
int  main()
{
        __asm__("finit\n");
        return 0;
}
If it "fixes" it, there is no problem with the FPU, but with the
'C' runtime library which doesn't initialize the FPU to a known
state before it uses it. It is possible for the kernel to work
around th 'C' library problem by clearing the FPU after every
fork(). The last time I checked (years ago), 'finit' was executed
during the fork. Maybe it isn't anymore because it takes many
machine-cycles to complete.
If this doesn't "fix" it, then your hardware may have a problem
like overheating, etc., (loose heatsink?).
Cheers,
