Well, I don't think it would help in this particular case.  The memory got divided
almost ideally in swsusp_shrink_memory() and we were hit by the lowmem
reserve in ZONE_DMA, apparently.
Still I've been doing a crash course in mm internals recently and I can say a
bit more about your patch now. ;-)
First, I agree that using balance_pgdat() for freeing memory by swsusp is
overkill, so the removal of its second argument seems to be a good idea to
me.  However, I'd rather avoid modifying struct scan_control and shrink_zone()
and reimplement the shrink_zone()'s logic directly in shrink_all_memory(),
with some modifications (eg. we can explicitly avoid shrinking of the active
list until we decide it's worth it) -- or we can define a separate function for
this purpose.
Second, there are a couple of details I'd do in a different way.  For example
I think we should call shrink_slab() with the non-zero first argument
(otherwise it'll use SWAP_CLUSTER_MAX) and instead of setting
zone->prev_priority to 0 I'd set vm_swappiness to 100 temporarily
(or maybe l'd left it to the user to set swappiness before suspend?).
Also I think we can try to avoid slab shrinking until we start to shrink the
active zone or IOW until we can't get any more pages from the inactive
list alone.
If you don't mind, I'll try to rework your patch a bit in accordance with
the above remarks in the next couple of days.
Greetings,
Rafael
