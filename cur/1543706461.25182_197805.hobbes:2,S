I submitted a bug to the jfs people, because jfs incorrectly returns
-EINVAL (this isn't even documented in man pages as a valid return
from open()) from an open() on a filename with UTF-8 in it.
See 
http://www-124.ibm.com/developerworks/bugs/?func=detailbug&bug_id=3838&group_id=35
and 
http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=229308
This was triggered just by upgrading the console-utils package in
debian (the problem existed all along, except that when I first made
the filesystem a jfs one, I reinstalled from backups, rather than
reinstalling debian from scratch)

Just don't create a file called -rf.  :-)
