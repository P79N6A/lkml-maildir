I removed that line altogether (it does not really needed as mmc host will not be accessed
anymore). The problem is more elaborate. Here, the card fails, mmc_host_remove is called without
sleep beforehand, and "after remove" message is printed immediately after it. Only then, mmc_block
remembers to finish its business. If I leave the sleep in place, mmc_block's stuff will get
scheduled before the mmc_remove_host and everything will be all right.
You may also notice that host is already powered off ("Setting ... power 0" message) and still
mmc_block continues to make requests like nothing happened.
