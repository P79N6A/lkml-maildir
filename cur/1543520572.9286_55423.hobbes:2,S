Perl using two licenses for ages (Artictic & GPL). There are hundreds (if not
thousands) contributurs and so far no big problems due usage of two licenses.
If someone saying "I'm only allow my modifications to be used with GPL" such
change is not even considered to inclusion and all is well :-)

ONLY if said person will make saparate distribution and push it agressively.
EVRY unlikely scenario. Most will just give you codeunder both licenses.
There are hundreds of packages on CPAN licensed this way. There are expat,
licensed this way. If someone refuse to license modifications under both
MPL and GPL -- ignore him. That's all.

Not if GPL is an option.

As perl, expat and quite a few other projects shows 99% of potential
contributors will honour ALL licenses stated in text. 1% will try to insist
on GPL. Ignore them. Expat is included in Apache now. Exactly since there are
option to use it under MPL license. Just make clear that for any contribution
to be included in future version of DinX you asking for two licenses. That's
all.

Then such modifications will not be included in DinX and will be used only
on your precisious system. Not a big deal (if it's not a "really great
contribution" (tm) that is :-))

Perl is using two licenses and I bet is used on many systems than linux kernel
([almost] every distribution of Linux has perl included but there are a lot
of non-linux systems with perl :-)
