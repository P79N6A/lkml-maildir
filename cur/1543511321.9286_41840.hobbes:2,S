Actually I guess it is 32768. uid_t is supoed to be unsigned integer, but it
looks like some applications are using it as a signed integer, therefore
32768 is the allowed max. Hmm.. on my system I dont have a problem with a
uid of 65533 (glibc2.1), shadow-password.

Why do u generate real unix users fo that in the first place? There are a
lot of pop-servers around which only need one uid. For example qmail-pop3
with a virtual checkpassword.
/usr/include/bits/types.h:typedef unsigned int __u_int;
/usr/include/bits/types.h:typedef __u_int __uid_t;              /* Type of user identifications.  */
