Subject: arc/arm/config.in still broken 2.4.19-2.4.29 ?

Greetings list.
arch/arm/config.in has an error which breaks make.
I've googled this a bit just by searching for drivers/ssi/Config.in and the 
first reference I find to this breakage is in 2002 !
For completeness shouldn't this really be removed once and for all?
I'm not clear on what the procedure is for submitting a patch, but, I've 
included one to save somebody else the bother.
Best
Bryan
