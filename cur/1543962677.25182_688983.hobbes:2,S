This is the third version of the address space control patches. These
patches are against 2.6.25-mm1  and have been tested using KVM in SMP mode,
both with and without the config enabled.
The first patch adds the user interface. The second patch fixes the
cgroup mm_owner_changed callback to pass the task struct, so that
accounting can be adjusted on owner changes. The thrid patch adds accounting
and control. The fourth patch updates documentation.
An earlier post of the patchset can be found at
http://lwn.net/Articles/275143/
This patch is built on top of the mm owner patches and utilizes that feature
to virtually group tasks by mm_struct.
