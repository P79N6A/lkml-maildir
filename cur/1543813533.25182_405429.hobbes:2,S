Hmm... it looks different from that bug - in that case the root cause
was sysfs_make_dirent failing, presumably when the sysfs node for the
device was being set up, by unplugging and re-plugging the device a
lot.  Here it's oopsing when the node is being removed, after it's
been in use a while and unplugged only once.  But yes ppp may not have
anything to do with it.  I'll try it on an older kernel to see if I
can reproduce there...
