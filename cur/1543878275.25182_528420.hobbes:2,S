Looks like this path ,
arch/i386/kernel/tsc.c: time_cpufreq_notifier(); <-- takes xtime_lock
			 mark_tsc_unstable();
            		  clocksource_change_rating(&clocksource_tsc, 0);
			   timekeeping_change_clocksource(); <-- takes xtime_lock
I'm not sure why the time_cpufreq_notifier is taking the xtime_lock tho .
