As far as i know partition ID's are only supposed to say what type of
filesystems is on a partition, which is a totally stupid and crappy idea
that makes no sense whatsoever (i feel strongly about this).
Linux filesystems have a filesystem type field in the filesystems
superblock, which is what mount -a tries to use to guess the filesystem,
the problem is that this flag isnt in the same place, so its not as
valuable as it should be.
Have a partition marker to indicate the filesystem is stupid because the
two are totally independent, of course i can format a filesystem of type
0x82 with whatever filesystem i want, and then there is also sorts of
confusion when the partition table says the wrong thing.
In an ideal world the filesystem superblock flag for any filesystem type
would be easy to get to, and then would also be a partition_table flag
magic bit that indicates the type of partition table (i.e. pc_bios,
solaris, bsd, atari/amiga, LVM) with the absence of the partition_type
flag you could assume it was a whole disk and check my reading the
superblock filesystem.
But of course you could never have an idealistic thing such as this
becuase different people would have to agree on one place for the flags.
