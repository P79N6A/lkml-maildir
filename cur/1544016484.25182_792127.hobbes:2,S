Aside from the code in socket does this reference count really get used
that often? Atomic_t gets used for ref counts is lots of other places in
the kernel, so why not turn module_ref into an atomic counter & drop the
array entirely saving all of the memory & disk space?
I do wonder if socket could manage its module lifetimes in some other
way, then we really could just use an atomic module ref without too much
impact. I didn't get very far in trying to work out what exactly was
going on in socket.c but maybe it's worth another look.
I don't have any network test harness so it's difficult to tell what
impact any code change is going to have. Do you have any suggestions for
a good test of this?
