Subject: [patch 0/6][RFC] Cleanup FIBMAP
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/10/26/529

The following series is meant to clean up FIBMAP paths with the eventual goal of allowing users to be able to FIBMAP their data.
I'm sending this as an RFC as I've only tested this on a x86_64 kernel with a 32bit binary on ext2 and I've noticed a couple ext2_warnings already.
I'm unsure of the locking in [4/6] fix_race_with_truncate.patch.  Any help here would greatly be appreciated.
The last patch, [6/6] drop_cap_sys_rawio_for_fibmap.patch, is of course, not to be applied until any remaining issues are fixed :)
Thanks,
Mike Waychison
