This thread is getting a bit soft on technical details and/or value.
Hans, please post the results of fsstress (the bits from ext3 cvs) on
reiser4 on SMP machines of non-i386 architectures (e.g. ppc64, sparc64,
ia64) as well as the results of transferring reiser4 filesystems
between machines whose PAGE_SIZE, wordsize and endianness vary.
