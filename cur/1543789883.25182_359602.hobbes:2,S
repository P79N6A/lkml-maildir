   Maybe I'm catching something here? Maybe not - no xruns as of yet,
but I've never seen these messages before. Kernel config attached.
   dmesg has filled up with these messages:
Read missed before next interrupt
`IRQ 8'[798] is being piggy. need_resched=0, cpu=0
Read missed before next interrupt
`IRQ 8'[798] is being piggy. need_resched=0, cpu=0
Read missed before next interrupt
`IRQ 8'[798] is being piggy. need_resched=0, cpu=0
Read missed before next interrupt
wow!  That was a 14 millisec bump
`IRQ 8'[798] is being piggy. need_resched=0, cpu=0
Read missed before next interrupt
wow!  That was a 12 millisec bump
`IRQ 8'[798] is being piggy. need_resched=0, cpu=0
Read missed before next interrupt
wow!  That was a 17 millisec bump
