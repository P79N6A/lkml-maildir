I think they are ok, just over sensitive debugging checks. How many of
them did you get? If the back trace always contains schedule(), and none
of them is before <schedule+0x405>, then we are ok.
CPU0:			CPU1:
runs threadA
			page stealer, tries to free a page
			from threadA
begins to switch from threadA to threadB
			reads threadA->cpu_vm_mask.
changes cpu_tlbstate & cr3
*
* I assume that a hardware interrupt arrives here,
* otherwise the race is to tiny.
*
			sends the IPI to the cpu_vm_mask
IPI arrives, and prints the stack dump
Ingo, do you agree?
