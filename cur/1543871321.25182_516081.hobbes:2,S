Yep.  The fact that it is possible to do that doesn't imply that it is
the best solution.
Oh, and btw:  What was the reason why kvm paravirtualization doesn't use
the vmi interface?

xen and vmware are still two very different hypervisors from the memory
mangement point of view.  I doubt moving the abstraction line within the
linux kernel from paravirt_ops to vmi makes QA easier.
