	Aiee... Yes, you are right. And it doesn't make me too happy -
I'ld rather have the thing usable for writing from kernel space. And
set_fs() trick is not too nice.
	Hmm... What about aliasing the page from kernel space instead of
get_page()?

	And in your scenario with write() from mmaped area it will give
you what? Random junk being written into file, AFAICS.
