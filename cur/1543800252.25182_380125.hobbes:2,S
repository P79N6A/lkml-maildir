Trying to find a "as simple as possible" test case for this problem
(that I consider a BUG in priority calculation) I've come up with this
very simple program:
------ sched_fooler.c -------------------------------
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
static void burn_cpu(unsigned int x)
{
	static char buf[1024];
	int i;
	
	for (i=0; i < x; ++i)
		buf[i%sizeof(buf)] = (x-i)*3;
}
int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
	unsigned long burn;
	if (argc != 2)
		return 1;
	burn = (unsigned long)atoi(argv[1]);
	while(1) {
		burn_cpu(burn*1000);
		usleep(1);
	}
	return 0;
}
----------------------------------------------

If I only run 2 of these together the system becomes everything but
interactive ;)
./a.out 10000 & ./a.out 4000

 5713 paolo     16   0  2396  320  252 S 37.1  0.1   0:07.63 a.out
DD TEST: the usual DD test (to read 128 MB from a non-cached file =
disk bounded) says everything, numbers with 2.6.15-rc7:
paolo@tux /mnt $ mount space/; time dd if=space/bigfile of=/dev/null bs=1M count=128; umount space/
128+0 records in
128+0 records out
real    0m4.052s
user    0m0.004s
sys     0m0.180s
START 2 OF THEM "./a.out 10000 & ./a.out 4000"
paolo@tux /mnt $ mount space/; time dd if=space/bigfile of=/dev/null bs=1M count=128; umount space/
128+0 records in
128+0 records out
real    2m4.578s
user    0m0.000s
sys     0m0.244s
This does't surprise me anymore, since DD gets priority 18 and these
two CPU eaters get 15/16.
As usual "nicksched" is NOT affected at all, IOW it gives to these CPU
eaters the priority that they deserve.
