Subject: [PATCH 005 of 9] md: Make sure a reshape is started when device switches to read-write.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

A resync/reshape/recovery thread will refuse to progress when the
array is marked read-only.  So whenever it mark it not read-only, it
is important to wake up thread resync thread.
There is one place we didn't do this.
The problem manifests if the start_ro module parameters is set, and a
raid5 array that is in the middle of a reshape (restripe) is started.
The array will initially be semi-read-only (meaning it acts like it is
readonly until the first write).  So the reshape will not proceed.
On the first write, the array will become read-write, but the reshape
will not be started, and there is no event which will ever restart
that thread.
