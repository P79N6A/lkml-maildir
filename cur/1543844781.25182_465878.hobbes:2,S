Even for the MAP_PRIVATE mmaps? But what does that solve?
Even if you restrict mprotect() too, the malicious app will
simply read() the code in the anonymously mapped region,
while the properly-written code just breaks.
Is it documented in any spec or done in any other system?

Yes, I myself think "noexec" is rather useless and can always
be bypassed. But whether that particular handling is correct,
doesn't look obvious to me.

So do you mean such a checks were added as a quick hack till
the proper solution is implemented? That may explain the issue,
at least partially...
