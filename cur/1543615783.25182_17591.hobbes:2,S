I have no problem with using 32 queues as long as we keep the code
flexible enough to increase the queue length if needed. I think we should
make it flexible and not restrict ourselves to something like word size.
(with this i'm not suggesting that you meant this, i'm just trying to make
sure.) I saw really good (behavioral, latency, not performance) effects of
the longer queue under high load, but this must be weighed against the
cache footprint of the queues.
