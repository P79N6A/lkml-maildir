Maybe.  Does this add anything to the picture?  During boot,
recalc_task_prio() is called with now < p->timestamp.  This causes quite
a stir.  If you WARN_ON(now < p->timestamp) or printk, you'll have a
dead box due to hundreds of gripes as things churn.  Adding...
if (unlikely(now < p->timestamp))
	__sleep_time = 0ULL;
...turns it into exactly one gripe.
