Heh, yeah. My percentage ends up being much lower, mostly because patches 
that come through Andrew are generally already cleaned-up (I edit those 
too, but it tends to be one or two per batch, not more than that).
I'm happy you do edit them, because not everybody does, and I do think 
it's part of being a subsystem maintainer, but I also end up occasionally 
sending emails to the parties involved to try to keep editing to a mimumum 
in the future - I personally suspect that it's to a large degree because 
people don't think about the effect in the logs..
(Some other projects also tend to have very different models for what a 
commit message should look like, so much of it is probably "cultural" too. 
I've seen projects that consistently had totally unreadable one-liner 
commit messages because (a) nobody ever read them anyway (because the log 
just isn't useful when it's per-file) and (b) people were encouraged to 
just use things like 'cvs ci -m"Fix bug"' to check in their stuff.
So the kernel is probably fairly odd in generally not asking for any 
fixed-format stuff at all (like the GNU changelogs do) but instead writing 
a small human-readable novella ;)
