Look at "brw_page" in fs/buffer.c.  It creates new temporary
buffer_heads with which to do IO on a page, and submits them with the
"end_buffer_io_async" callback.  That callback cleans up after the IOs
and wakes up any processes waiting on the page IO.
The buffer_heads are never in the buffer cache at any time.
