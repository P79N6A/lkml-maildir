[SNIPPED...]
The extended partition goes from 2648 to 3736. The first part of
this extended partition from 2648 to 2713 is swap. The second part
of 2714 to 3736 is the FAT32 partition. It looks as though M$ tries
to use the swap area, ignoring the 82 code for Linux swap. This
may be why the M$ partition gets trashed. To test this theory,
disable swap on this drive (comment it out in /etc/fstab). Re-do
the M$ partition and see if it remains clean. If it remains
clean, then do a `mkswap` from Linux. Reboot to M$ and verify that
the last partition is now corrupt. This will show that M$ is
trying to use the swap area. If it is, re-fdisk the extended
partition to put Linux swap at the end instead of the beginning.
This should work around the M$ bug.
Cheers,

    was handled in the BIOS, I found that there aren't any.
