Don't.  I'm actually glad about some flash with sizes not exactly
matching a power of two.  It causes you some pain, but generally helps
to find bugs.

Still can't.  Block devices have the attribute that writing AAA... to
a block containing BBB... gives you one of three possible results in
case of power failure:
1. BBB...BBB all written
2. AAA...AAA nothing written
3. AAA...BBB partially written.
Flash doesn't have 3, but two more cases:
4. FFF...FFF erased, nothing written
5. AAA...FFF erased, partially written
Plus the really obnoxious
6. FFF...FFF partially erased.  Looks fine but some bits may flip
   randomly, writes may not stick, etc.
Now try finding a filesystem that is robust if 4-6 happens. ;)

What does this thing do?

Definitely.

You can't tell where a program is going to spend its time. Bottlenecks
occur in surprising places, so don't try to second guess and put in a
speed hack until you've proven that's where the bottleneck is.
