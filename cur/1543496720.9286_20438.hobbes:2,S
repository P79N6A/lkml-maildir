Hi,
Anyone know when the ISDN drivers and CVS utilities from suse.com
are going to be homogenised with 2.3.3? The latest 2.3.3 corrections
which were posted here lead to enormous numbers of oopsen when used,
so I'm trying to compile 2.2.9 with the 990522... snapshot. 2.2.7 is
my latest fully working kernel with CVS isdn so far.
Or maybe someone could give me subscription instructions for the
Linux ISDN list? The kernelnotes.org archive doesn't appear to have
any relevant discussion on it so far.
Thanks,
John Hayward-Warburton
