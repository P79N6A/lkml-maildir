It's a little past April Fool's day. What are you guys
smoking? Next, you'll want to change all the 'i's to
'y's and add 'ing'.
Certainly one might want to change:
	int TheVariableThatWillBeUsedAsACounter;
to..
	int i;
However, changing the spelling of a variable name is
absurd no matter how you look at it.
