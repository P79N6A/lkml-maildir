Ah, I meant to include that in my first email.  It's the latest NVidia
driver 1.0-5336.  I know, I know, but it's worked fine with 2.6.5 and all
previous.  Also, just the dedicated quake 3 server core dumped, the quake 3
client running on the same machine did not crash.  At the time of the crash,
there were four clients connected to the quake 3 server.  I realize the
NVidia driver could have corrupted some memory some where else, but if
that's the case, I would have thought it would have shown this behavior
previous, and not just with 2.6.6-rc1.  Unless of course, something in
2.6.6-rc1 specifically altered something the NVidia driver makes use of.  I
guess.  :-)
