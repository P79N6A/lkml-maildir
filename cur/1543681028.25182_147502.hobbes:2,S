You need per-user policies to achieve fairness, the global allocation
won't work. You need global fairness towards tasks != SOFTRR *and* local
fairness towards tasks == SOFTRR. If you limit globally the maximum time
that SOFTRR tasks can suck, you'll achieve global fairness. But you do not
prevent a single user to suck most of this slice by creating many SOFTRR
tasks (or exploits). I can easily fix this if someone will show real
interest in the thing. Since it has been a while that I was not
looking at the scheduler, yesterday I googled a little bit and I saw
that there are a few issues where you do not need SOFTRR to completely
starve other tasks though (the irman thingy for example). IMHO these
should be discussed before going in 2.6, to either fix them or publicly
recognize them as "Not A Bug".
