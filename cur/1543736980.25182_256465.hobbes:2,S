hi!
the snull.c codes were compiled, 
snull.o was generated,
modprobe snull (though there was a warning that the
module is tainted, but this can be ignored, right?)
was done,
ifconfig sn[01] local[01] were executed,
and now what? i would like to test sending packets of
data. but how will i do it?
or where do i start?
or what should i invoke?
any kind of help is very much appreciated.
thanks.
-donald
