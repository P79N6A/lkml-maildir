Can I suggest the following header format for the quota file:
 Q> struct quota_header {
 Q>	char		id[5];
 Q>	unsigned char	vsn;
 Q>	unsigned short	endian;
 Q> };
 Q>
 Q> struct quota_header qh = { "QUOTA", 0, 0x1234 };
This should occupy exactly eight bytes, and deal with all of the
problems mentioned. It has the following properties:
 1. A 'magic number' that identifies the file format and can be
    added to the database for the `file` program. This can also
    be used to determine whether the quota file has the header
    present or not.
 2. A 'version number' that can be incremented to specify changes
    to the format of the quota file.
 3. A multi-byte word with known value that can be used to decide
    whether values in the quota file are stored in little-endian
    or big-endian format. The code can then adjust itself to deal
    with whatever is found.
OK, the use of "unsigned char" to specify an 8-bit field, and the use
of "unsigned short" to specify a 16-bit field is probably not what
Linux uses, but that can easily be changed to use whatever names Linux
uses for suchlike fields.
Other than that point, comments, anybody?
Best wishes from Riley.
