What about the !PREEMPT_RT case.. It still wouldn't disable interrupts
in the below.. 
-       local_irq_save(flags);
        if (up->port.sysrq) {
                /* serial8250_handle_port() already took the lock */
                locked = 0;
        } else if (oops_in_progress) {
-               locked = spin_trylock(&up->port.lock);
+               locked = spin_trylock_irqsave(&up->port.lock, flags);
        } else
-               spin_lock(&up->port.lock);
+               spin_lock_irqsave(&up->port.lock, flags);
