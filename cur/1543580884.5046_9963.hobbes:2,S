Wrong.
Neither the read nor the write are page-aligned. I don't know where you
got that idea. It's obviously not true even in the common case: it depends
_entirely_ on what the file offsets are, and expecting the offset to be
zero is just being stupid. It's often _not_ zero. With networking it is in
fact seldom zero, because the network packets are seldom aligned either in
size or in location.
Also, there are many reasons why "page" may have different meaning. We
will eventually have a page-cache where the pagecace granularity is not
the same as the user-level visible one. User-level may do mmap at 4kB
boundaries, even if the page cache itself uses 8kB or 16kB pages.
THERE IS NO PAGE-ALIGNMENT. And anything that even _mentions_ the word
page-aligned is going into my trash-can faster than you can say "bug".
