It is generally not a good idea to even think about the piece
of paper you  were forced to sign when you got the job. The
contents of that piece of paper are generally not enforceable
because your signature was, obviously, obtained under duress.
You either sign the paper or you don't get the job.
In general, if your conscience is clear, you will have no
problem --but you don't run up and down the corridors advertising
that you "gave something away" to Linux. Instead, with the
utmost of professional integrity, you do what you can, when
you can. Your company expects that you will contribute 110%
of your time to the company. This leaves -10% for your laundry
and Linux.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
