I have a similar problem. The 2.5 keyboard/psmouse driver does not work
at all with my KVM. It's a bit unusual combination in that I run an 
Intellimouse on it and the KVM doesn't let all Intellimouse extensions
through, but it is still autodetected as that. Normally (xfree86, 2.4 gpm,
other OS) it works fine when just setting PS/2 mouse maually. Even when I 
hack the kernel to force PS/2 instead of the IMPS/2 then I just get 
endless "psmouse: lost synchronization .." messages.
When I don't use the mouse and just use the keyboard it usually
works fine some time, but then eventually when doing more keyboard work
(e.g. editing a file on the console) the keyboard locks up 
again with the mouse driver complaining about 'lost sychronization' 
I guess it's needed now to use USB keyboard/mouse with 2.5 :-(

This is the patch to force a particular mouse type, also adds some debugging
for this case. The lost byte is always a '0'
