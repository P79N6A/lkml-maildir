Just to follow up to myself, after futher testing, it looks like it's an
SMP-related problem.  I'm not yet sure if it's an SMP-Via chipset
problem or just an SMP problem.  I've heard from two people with this
same problem.  I think one of them has a Via chipset and I'm not sure
about the other one.  
Can anybody look into this or give me a good brain dump on how I can fix
it?
Thanks,
pete
