After exiting namespaces, the process notifies parent. With new changes
to signals (in this patchset), the signal code may need to determine
the namespace of sender (the exiting child in this case).

and sender still is 'current' (the exiting child).

Hmm. Its not unsafe at present. It would become unsafe if the signals code
tries to determine the namespace of sender.
