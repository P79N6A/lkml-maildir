True. But how long is it going to be before klibc is merged?

I'll add this to my todo list for the stuff I'm working on. I actually needed 
to figure this out anyway, so...

On laptops where the BIOS may be compressed and stored somewhere I doubt it'd 
be safe to run any parts of that image from a saved copy. It might try 
calling into routines that no longer exist outside the compressed ROM. THat 
could seriously compromise the stability of the system.

Simple and effective. This, as well, is going onto my ever growing list. 
Because of the seriousness of this single issue this is going near the top of 
the "After you get the first bits merged" part.

Good idea and highly effective.
Like I've said, this has gone onto my list. Now to get back to the code... I 
really do want to see about getting this stuff into the kernel ASAP.
