Hi all,
        I am programming device driver on PLX 9060 chipsets,
I want to use PCI-DMA method to transfer data from memory to port outside.
but, which  I find functions in kernel are all to ISA, e.g. request_dma()...
I don't know how to config DMA of PCI on my chipsets, and no any examples is in kernel source codes.
as if I should config registers, but I don't know how to do.
any help are appreciated.
thanks in advance.
BRs,
            -Jim
