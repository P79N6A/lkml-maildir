Hi, since 2.6.17.17 in drivers/pci/quirks.c (quirk_via_irq) all VIA
chipsets are listed seperately instead of the "include everything"
PCI_ANY_ID.
This is however problematic with my chipset.
The ethernet controller, a VT6102 (Rhine-II) and the audio controller,
VT8233/A/8235/8237 need a fix to work.
Including PCI_ANY_ID again fixes these problems but is of course a
pretty evil fix. The problem is I can't find out which PCI ids to
include. I'm new to this list so suggestions are welcome.
