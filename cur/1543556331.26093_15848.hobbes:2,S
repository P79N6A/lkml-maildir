Subject: 2.4.0-test11: arch/i386/boot/bootsect.S incompatible with Vaio C1VE (Crusoe) floppy

2.4.0-test11, arch/i386/boot/bootsect.S has a probe_loop: to determine the
number of sectors that can be read at once (i.e. in one track).
This routine does not work with the Sony UDF5 USB floppy disk, mapped as an
Int13 device by the Vaio C1VE (Crusoe) BIOS.
Therefore, a bzdisk floppy will not be bootable.
I solved the problem for me by changing "disksizes: .byte 36, 18, 15, 9" to
"disksizes: .byte 18, 18, 18, 18", but I think someone should do it right.
I will assist debugging if needed.
Regards,
Wolfgang
