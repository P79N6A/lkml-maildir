Here's one I've started getting with the quicklist changes:
WARNING: mm/built-in.o - Section mismatch: reference to .init.text: from .text between 'kmem_cache_create' (at offset 0x1ba5c) and 'quicklist_total_size'
quicklist_total_size() is not marked __init, nor is show_mem() in
arch/sh/mm/init.c, where I've added the reference. Ideas?
