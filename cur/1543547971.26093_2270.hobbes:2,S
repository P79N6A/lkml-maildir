No I definitely do not agree.
In fact, I would never have seen that problem with _any_ debugger. It
simply would not have happened for me.
And guess what? I saw the bug without any debugger within minutes of
having been told what the problem was. A debugger would not have helped.
And that is the case in 99% of all cases. In most cases the people who see
the problem aren't the same people who can debug them. Giving such a
person a debugger doesn't help.
