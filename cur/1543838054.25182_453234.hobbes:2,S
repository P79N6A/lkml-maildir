Hi guys, 
I have a client that uses pentavalue DVB-S cards pretty much all over
their business, however the drivers has not been updated since 2002
(2.4 kernel only) I've spoken to the dev's at the company and they are
not interested in doing drivers for 2.6
The 2.4 drivers they released is source code format, however I could
not find any clear indication of licence agreements to use the code for
further development. 
I'm hoping that it's GPL'ed since MODULE_LICENSE("GPL"); appears in the
pentadrv.c and scanval.c files
I'm going to contact them again to confirm we can use the code for
2.4 to upgrade to 2.6 and possible include in the kernel source (if it
will be allowed :P) 
Lastly .. and the reason I'm mailing is .. I'm looking for somebody
that is keen on  doing the port .. I'll happily supply hardware (we
have lots of these cards) 
beer or other incentives can be negotiated ;P 
Thanks :)
