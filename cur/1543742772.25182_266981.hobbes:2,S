In that particular computer lab, admin is *****, and paranoid one,
too. He's more worried about security that functionality, and then you
find suid bash in /tmp and learn that root password is name of the
laboratory, with first character uppercased. Heh.
BTW interesting things can be done with sak alone. (It is bye-bye
vlock -a, right?). Changing console log-level and info-prints could
lead to user seeing some info he's not allowed to see [perhaps part of
some password are in the registers because they are now memcopied?],
but I agree allowing that is probably okay.
