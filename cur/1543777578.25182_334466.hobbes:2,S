I agree. I guess for mmap()ed access we can kick it back to buffered
mode.
I don't think limiting pagecache use per filesystem is an acceptable
option. In fact, database folks exactly want this -  to limit the
pagecache use by filesystems - but I don't think its right thing to do,
so I am trying to propose mount O_DIRECT as an alternative (if its
feasible).
Thanks,
