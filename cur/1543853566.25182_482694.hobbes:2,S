Many, many systems use %fs/%gs to implement some kind of thread-local
storage, and such usage is becoming more common; the PDA's use of it in
the kernel is no different.  I would agree that using all the obscure
corners of segmentation is just asking for trouble, but using %gs as an
address offset seems like something that's going to be efficient on x86
32/64 processors indefinitely.

Last time you raised this I did a pretty comprehensive set of tests
which showed there was flat out zero difference between using %fs and
%gs.  There doesn't seem to be anything to the theory that reloading a
null segment selector is in any way cheaper than loading a real
selector.  Did you find a problem in my methodology?
