so which direction should it be ?  or should it be both ? :)
Blackfin at the moment is doing DMA/bits_per_word setup in the boards
... we could move these to the drivers and have each one just call
spi_setup() at init, or i could post a patch for the common framework
if you think that's an OK direction to [also] go ...
