Hmmm, kgdb is currently out of reach for me: The latest downloadable
kgdb tar archive is for 2.6.7, and I can't access the CVS repository
(our firewall only allows http:80 and ftp). Does anyone have a
downloadable current version?
I tried KDB with 2.6.12-rc2 and RT 7.45-01. It patches fine (except for
one trivial reject), compiles fine, boots fine, but freezes immediately
and completely when actually entering kdb. Power off is the only way
out...
