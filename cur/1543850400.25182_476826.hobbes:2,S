You could always write a tiny GPL-ed wrapper module with the sole 
purpose of offering all EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL'ed functions through 
EXPORT_SYMBOL'ed wrapper functions.
You are using a gnu.org address for publically stating that trying to 
prevent such kinds of wrapping was unfair?
It's not even clear that any modules containing non-GPL'ed code were 
legal.
EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL shows a pretty clear intention, and offering 
functionality provided throug h EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL'ed symbols to 
proprietary code sounds very fishy.
