Subject: ThunderLAN NIC in PCI slot 7 in Proliant 3000 is not recognized in 2.3.x

I have just discovered that the NIC in my Proliant 3000 will not be recognized in PCI slot 7 with the 
2.3.x kernel series.  I have been running 2.2.13 for a while and it has no problem with the card 
being there.  I do not know if this is with the TLAN driver or the PCI code, but wanted to mention 
that as a bug.  I do not know if this is problem occurs with other cards (which would point to the 
PCI code as the problem)  I just switched the NIC to slot 3 and 2.3.40-pre4 is happy to find it now. 
 I will attempt to play around with another PCI card in the higher slots and see if I can pinpoint it to 
the card or the PCI bus part, unless somebody knows this to be a problem already.
