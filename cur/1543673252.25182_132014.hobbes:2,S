Same here, it seems rock solid on my dual athlon and has survived several
hours of 5 simultaneous make -j 8 bzImage modules with swapping. Definitely the
most stable for me since I've switched from Doug's to Justin's driver.
Marcelo, would it be unreasonable to include it in -rc3 ? After all, it would
not be a radical update, since it was removed from -rc2 ? Just a few bug fixes.
What do you think ?
Regards,
Willy
