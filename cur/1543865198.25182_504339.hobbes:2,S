Error message most probably also contains additional details...
There may be couple of reasons - one of them may be that your product is 
too old to run on 2.6.19.2 kernel without additional changes.  You 
should discuss these issues on 
http://www.vmware.com/community/index.jspa.
If you are quite sure that you've built your kernel from these sources, 
and you did not run 'make clean' (or make *config) after build kernel, 
then you most probably have to download 
http://knihovny.cvut.cz/ftp/pub/vmware/vmware-any-any-update107.tar.gz,
 
untar/ungzip it, run runme.pl from package, and follow directions...  It 
should work with all released Linux products.  If you are using 
Workstation 6.0 beta, you should contact VMware beta support.
