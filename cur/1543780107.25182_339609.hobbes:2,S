That does seem like a driver problem.

Realistically, we were probably going to crash anyway at this point as
we're apparently failing to recycle SKBs.
Netpoll generally must assume it won't get a second chance, as it's
being called by things like oops() and panic() and used by things like
kgdb. If netpoll fails, the box is dead anyway.

In general, there's no way to measure time here. And if we're
using netconsole, what makes you think there's any other console?

No and no. Most of my own testing is done with tg3.
