Umm. That would seem to only happen to work for a direct-mapped virtually 
indexed cache where the index is taken purely from the virtual address, 
and there are no "process context" bits in the virtually indexed D$.
The moment there are process context bits involved, afaik you absolutely 
_need_ to flush, because otherwise the other process will never pick up 
the dirty state (which it would need to reload from memory).
That said, maybe nobody does that. Virtual caches are a total braindamage 
in the first place, so hopefully they have limited use.
