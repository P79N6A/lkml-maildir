OK, I think that should fix most of it, and I'll admit it's cleaner
than the first one.

I've been mulling over how to kill prev_priority (and make everyone
happy, including akpm). My original thought was to keep a different
min_priority for each of GFP_IO, GFP_IO|GFP_FS, and the no IO ones.
But we still have the problem of how to accurately set the min back
up when we are sucessful.
Perhaps we should be a little more radical, and treat everyone apart
from kswapd as independant. Keep a kswapd_priority in the zone
structure, and all the direct reclaimers have their own local priority.
Then we set distress from min(kswap_priority, priority). All that does
is kick the direct reclaimers up a bit faster - kswapd has the easiest
time reclaiming pages, so that should never be too low.
