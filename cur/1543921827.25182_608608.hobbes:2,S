Yes, it would, but I tried to leave vmalloc doing the same thing as
it was before. I think that it would be safe simply to call put_page()
directly in the __vunmap() code and drop all the release function
passing, but I don't know enough about that code to say for certain.
I'll spin up another patch tomorrow that does this and see how it goes.

Seems to - it's passed XFSQA with 64k directories and a bunch of
dirstress workouts as well.
Nick, Jeremy, (others?) any objections to this approach to solve
the problem?
Cheers,
