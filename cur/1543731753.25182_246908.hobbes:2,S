That is good - although so far I have not heard complaints
about readprofile's memory use. Maybe multiple MB is not
so excessive these days.
But improvement is always good.
On the other hand, I like stability. Maybe readprofile is just some
kind of throwaway utility, not very important, but nevertheless,
some people use it, and they have habits and hate to relearn,
and they have scripts, and hate to adapt these scripts.
So, if the internal code is improved, excellent, but I am not so
happy if the invocation is changed without a very good reason.
Maybe you can make a cross: your improved algorithm inside the
old framework with options and locale?

Don't you know that whenever there are complaints about software
the very first question is "which version?"?

Well, you sent me something. I have three choices: take it as
replacement for the current version, ignore it, work on it.
I have no time to work on it, so am only happy with what you send
if it can replace the current version.
