The patch was almost good enough.  The problem with your simple
version was that on the subsequent call to ext3_dx_readdir, the -1 got
translated to a hash value of fffffffe, and if you were unlucky enough
to have a file whose hash was 0xfffffffe, you'd still end up looping
forever.
See the patch which I just sent to ext2-devel and LKML, which I think
solves both this problem and the conversion-to-htree-while-doing-NFS-readdir 
problem.   What I did was to treated f_pos==-1 as an explicit EOF cookie, 
instead of letting it get translated into large hash value.  I also explicitly 
returned a next_hash value of ~0 when there was no more leaf pages, which 
then got immediately translated into a f_pos value of -1.  This saves an 
extra call to ext3_htree_fill_tree(), a minor optimization.
