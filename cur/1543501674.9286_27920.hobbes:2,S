True, but people who depend on various subtle features of Linux would
like to upgrade kernals with confidence. They tend to get really upset
when someone that was fixed before becomes broken.
What does this mean? This means that *you* shouldn't spend your time
setting up regression, because it isn't an effective use of your
time. But someone else probably thinks its useful enough to do, and
*they* should do it.
Note that egcs now has a really big regression test. And you've seen
some people mention that they have some performance tests for kernals,
which is somewhat of a regression test.
