Hi all,
I just ran make configcheck on 2.6.0-test5 and the results are:
    832 files need linux/config.h but don't actually include it.
    689 files which include linux/config.h but don't require the header.
This seems like a hell of a lot to fix.  Would it not just be easier to
use the -imacros or -include and eliminate the "do we need to include
linux/config.h" question for ever?
