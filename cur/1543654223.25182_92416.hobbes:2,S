Thanks. Disks and partitions are now recognized, but root still won't
mount. Reiserfs (the root fs) is compiled in, along with IDE disk
support.  I tried getting rid of the advanced partitopn types options,
which eliminated the MS-DOS partition table message, but did not
otherwise change things.
The hdc error is also unexpected, unless it's simply the result of no
CD in the drive.
I hope this isn't another silly thing I'm missing.
