It appears this message hasn't spread wide enough yet. When reporting an
inotify-related build failure, I heard back from the GNOMES I shouldn't
be using outdated glibc headers but kernel headers instead... apparently
there's more need for discussion.
(Not that I'd find gamin particularly sensible, since it's undocumented,
and attracted WAY too much attention because of its flaws like SIGSEGV
in applications, 100% CPU loops and other shortcomings not only in Linux
environments, but also on FreeBSD.)
