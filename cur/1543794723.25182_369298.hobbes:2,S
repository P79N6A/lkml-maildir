Hi
This patch converts bigsmp to use flat physical mode instead of logical 
cluster mode similar to what we use for x86_64. This helps with plugging some
race conditions with cpu hotplug (IPI-race) and other things. More details in 
the respective patches.
Andrew: Please consider for -mm for some exposure
The series has 2 patches.
- Change bigsmp to use flat physical mode instead of logical cluster
- If hotplug is enabled choose bigsmp mode by default.
Both the above are default behaviour for x86_64 builds.
I have tested on some dual core boxes, it will help more testing if people
who use bigsmp can give feedback would be great.
Cheers,
ashok
