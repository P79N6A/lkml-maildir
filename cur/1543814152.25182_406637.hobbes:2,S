Hmm I investigated briefly and only C99 inlining (whatever that means) will 
allow me to locally inline and export as well. It would do so if I specified 
-finline-functions which is not our default at all in the kernel (we only 
recently disable -fnoinline-functions I believe). Anyway checking positively 
shows me this on gcc 4.1.0:
0xc0111283 <find_busiest_queue+83>:     call   0xc0110dc0 <weighted_cpuload>
So no, it doesn't get inlined.

I spent quite some time trying to find the least cost way to do this without 
uglifying code. I don't feel strongly about just how to do it though. 
Comments from Andrew and Ingo would be most welcome on this matter.
Cheers,
