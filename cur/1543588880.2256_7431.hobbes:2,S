True, but easy to catch.

Yeah, but NFS suddenly takes 25+50 words... That's the type of complaints
I'm thinking about.

NO. Sorry about shouting, but that's the way to madness. I can understand
code depending on SMP vs. UP and similar beasts, but presense of specific
filesystems.... <shudder>

That's pretty interesting - especially for sockets. I wonder whether
we would get problems with separate allocation of these - we don't
go from inode to socket all that often, but...
