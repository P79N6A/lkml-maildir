    Neither hwclock nor the /dev/rtc driver takes the following comment from
set_rtc_mmss() in arch/i386/kernel/time.c into account.  As a result, using
hwclock --systohc or --adjust always leaves the Hardware Clock 500 ms ahead of
the System Clock:
     * In order to set the CMOS clock precisely, set_rtc_mmss has to be
     * called 500 ms after the second nowtime has started, because when
     * nowtime is written into the registers of the CMOS clock, it will
     * jump to the next second precisely 500 ms later. Check the Motorola
     * MC146818A or Dallas DS12887 data sheet for details.
(It looks like the only thing that does account for it is the 11-minute
STA_UNSYNC updater in do_timer_interrupt(), in arch/i386/kernel/time.c .)
Shouldn't there be some kernel interface that hides this machine-dependency
from user-level code; i.e., that sets time more precisely?
