Agreed.  Unloading is as fundamental as loading - especially as a lot of users load and unload modules as a, (bad), way to use two incompatible devices on one port.  Once you introude a bloatule (I.E. module that can't be unloaded), that stops working.  As more and more people start relying on the behavior, it gets to be more of a problem.
