Subject: [PATCH] SCHED_FIFO and SCHED_RR scheduler fix, kernel 2.4.18
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2002/6/12/95

The 2.4.18 kernel was behaving incorrectly for SCHED_FIFO and SCHED_RR 
scheduling. 
The correct behaviour for SCHED_FIFO is priority preemption:
run to completion, or system call, or preemption by higher priority 
process. The correct behaviour for SCHED_RR is the same as SCHED_FIFO for 
the preemption case, or run for a time slice, and go to the back of the 
run queue for that priority.
More details can be found at:
http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/7908799/xsh/realtime.html
As a side note, SCHED_RR is completely broken in the 2.2 series kernels.
This is a small patch, but fixes the behaviour for SCHED_FIFO and SCHED_RR 
scheduling in the 2.4.18 kernel. It also improves the efficiency of the 
kernel by NOT calling schedule() for every tick for a SCHED_FIFO process.
