more data from this morning:
tried 2.2.10 again, using two simultaneous `make -j10 bzImage' build sessions.
the first run aborted with solid lock (again no kernel message, no more
VC switching or Alt+SysReq) after 2*6 kernel builds (1.5 hours).
there have been no compile errors for these 2*6 builds though.
the next run was more `successfull':  2*12 builds did not lockup, but
I got 7 aborts with SIGSEGV, gcc internal error etc., 4/3 per session.
compared with 2*27 perfect kernel builds with 2.2.5, now I'm pretty sure
it's not a hardware bug on my side.

PS: I'm even monitoring CPU temperature and CPU fan rotation, no single
problem or difference between bad 2.2.10 and good 2.2.5 runs showed up.
