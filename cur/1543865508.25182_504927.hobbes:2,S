Sorry for not being more precise. As a part of my thesis work I need to
migrate pages. I greatly use mm/migrate.c code.  
I assume that not all pages can be migrated - especially those used by
kernel (where direct virtual to physical mapping is used).
So I intended something like following code:
/* Returns 0 if page is suitable to be migration source */
int check_migrate_page(struct page * page)
{
	return PageBuddy(page) || PageCompound(page) || ... 
		kernel_page(page);
}
/* Steals pfn page from its current user(s) and replace it by newly
 * allocated page. pfn page structure is returned if page was migrated
 * to new location (can be reused by caller) or NULL otherwise.
 */
struct page * steal_page(unsigned long pfn)
{
	int ret;
	struct page *page, *target_page;
	page = pfn_to_page(pfn);
	if(!page)
		goto bad_page;
	ret = check_migrate_page(page);
	if(ret)
		goto bad_page;
	target_page = alloc_pages(flags, 0);
	/* uses migrate_pages function internally */
	ret = do_migration(page, target_page);
	if(ret)
		goto bad_page;
	/* TODO clear page frame data. */
	return page;
bad_page:
	return NULL;
}
Please add me to Cc, because I am not the list member.
