Umm, no, that's actually an 82558 rev B. pci.ids should be updated to 
have "Intel Corporation 8255[7-9]" for this id, because Intel can't make 
up their minds to change the PCI id when they release a new product.
rev 1-3 are 82557, rev 4-5 are 82558, rev 6-8 are 82559.

The OEM probably forgot to initialized the eeprom correctly, because 
82558 rev B and higher don't have this bug. Anyway, the workaround is 
pretty harmless.
