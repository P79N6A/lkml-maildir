It looks as if it could have been 10 minutes quicker according to amplot, but 
that's entirely within the expected variations that amanda's scheduler might 
do to it.  But the one that just finished, running under CFS-v5 was only 
1h:47m, not including the verify run.  The previous backup using sd-0.44, 
took 2h:28m for a similar but not identical operation according to amplot.  
That's a big enough diff to be an indicator I believe, but without knowing 
how much of that time was burned by gzip, its an apples and oranges compare.  
We'll see if it repeats, I coded 'catchup' to do 2 in a row.
>Great thanks for feedback.
You're quite welcome, Con.
ATM I'm doing the same thing again but booted to a CFS-v5 delta that Ingo sent 
me privately,  and except for the kmail lag/freezes everything is cool except 
the cpu, it managed to hit 150.7F during the height of one of the gzip -best 
smunching operations.  I believe the /dev/hdd writes are cranked well up from 
the earlier CSF patches also.  Unforch, this isn't something that's been 
coded into amplot, so I'm stuck watching the hdd display in gkrellm and 
making SWAG's.  And we all know what they are worth.  I've made a lot of them 
in my 72 years, and my track record, with some glaring exceptions like my 2nd 
wife that I won't bore you with the details of, has been fairly decent. :)
