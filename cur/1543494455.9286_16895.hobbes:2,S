I think a safer bet would be to say "Intel introduced the CPUID
instruction with late-model 486s and Pentiums".  I have a '486SX-33 here
that supports the CPUID instruction.  The computer was bought in July '94.
For AMDs, I don't know about AMD486's, but AMD5x86s (hot-rodded '486s)
also support CPUID (have one at work that supports CPUID).
Beyond that, I think I'll get off the soapbox for someone else.
