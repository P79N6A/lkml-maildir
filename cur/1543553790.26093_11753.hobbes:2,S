   Ok, but why doesn't 2.2.16 exhibit this behavior?
   We've had reports from quite a number of people complaining about
   this and I'm fairly certain not all of them are from Earthlink.
The only thing different is that 2.2.x is packetizing the write()
system calls on the server differently, otherwise there is no
difference whatsoever.
What 2.4.x is doing is completely legal.  Really, even if not all of
these people are from Earthlink (well, you should see if this is for
certain) they may all be using the same buggy terminal server at these
different ISPs.
