It looks like, those patches are for the test kernels. 
I could not find one that can be used for the final released 2.4.0 kernel. 
I am not sure which one should I use. So far I was using test10 
kernel and then corresponding ia64 patch for test10 on my ia64 system.
Is it that I can apply any patch to the released 2.4.0 kernel ?
If not , then which patch should I use ?
Thanks and regards,
