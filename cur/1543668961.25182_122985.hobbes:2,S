So, say you have a choice of either a 256Kb request to a low block number,
which can use the faster 28-bit mode, or a 512Kb request to the same low block
number, which can only be made using 48-bit LBA, which is the best to use?
I originally thought that we might only be honouring 512Kb requests for blocks
over the 28-bit limit, which Jens corrected me on, but maybe we *should* only
do 512Kb requests on high block number, where we have to use 48-bit anyway.
John.
