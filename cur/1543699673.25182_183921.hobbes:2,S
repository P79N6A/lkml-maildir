Subject: Possible shared mapping bug in 2.4.23 (at least MIPS/Sparc)

The current MIPS 2.4 kernel (from CVS) currently allows fixed shared
mappings to violate D-cache aliasing constraints.
The check for illegal fixed mappings is done in
arch_get_unmapped_area(), but these mappings are granted in
get_unmapped_area() and arch_get_unmapped_area() is never called.
A quick look at sparc and sparc64 seem to show the same problem.
