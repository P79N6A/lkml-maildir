As the v2.0.39pre-kernels has made some changes that might affect
programs and/or databases running on large hardware (> 1 GB of memory and
large database-sets) I'd REALLY like some help to test it out on such a
machine, as I have no such hardware myself to test on. While I'm pretty
convinced that the changes should be ok, I don't want this to become
Famous Last Words(tm).
pre-patch-2.0.39-7 has just been released (see anouncement on my homepage
and on lkml) and can be found here:
