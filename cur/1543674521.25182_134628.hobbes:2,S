We seem to have flush_icache_page() in install_page() - I wonder whether
we should also have flush_dcache_page() in there as well.
I've always been confused about what flush_icache_page() is there for,
and its a no-op on ARM.  Whether it should or shouldn't be is an
unanswered question, and will probably remain unanswered until I can
sit down and go through the whole of the VM layer, working out exactly
what it requires and where today.
Maybe someone more knowledgeable of the VM layer can comment.
