Right.  The problem is that the ptrace() call to continue the process
(which implicitly sends a SIGCONT) also wakes up the process.  We have
a test program which, if you'd run it normally, would not finish in
aeons.  If you run it under gdb with all the ptrace() calls to stop
and continue all the threads, it finishes.  This change in behaviour
is not wanted nor can it be avoided by gdb without a kernel change.
