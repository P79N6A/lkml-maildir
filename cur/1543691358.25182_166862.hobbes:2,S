Not *entirely* true. I know of hardware that would scream if it were opened
and refuse to boot the next time, unless a bios password would be entered.
Sure, it can be circumvented, but allowing software to bypass such measures
seems silly.
However, in this case, lilo or grub or whatever should prevent the user from
entering kernel parameters if they aren't authorized, not the kernel.
