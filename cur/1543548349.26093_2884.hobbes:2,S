	i think you miss the point.  i think that Linus is trying to say
something along the lines of "A hacker does for love what others would not do
for money."  Think about it; who would you rather work with: someone who is
there because they enjoy the work, truly thrive in the environment, and is
pleasant to be around -or- someone who does it just because they're paid, they
"only work here" and would prefer a debugger because it means they don't have
to think as hard.
