If you add a slab free object callback, then you have the beginnings
of a more flexible solution to memory reclaim from the slabs.
For example, you can easily implement a reclaim-not-allocate method
for new slab allocations for when there is no memory available or the
size of the slab is passed some configurable high water mark...
Right now these is no way to control the size of a slab cache.  Part
of the reason for the fragmentation I have seen is the massive
changes in size of the caches due to the OS making wrong decisions
about memory reclaim when small changes in the workload occur. We
currently have no way to provide hints to help the OS make the right
decision for a given workload....
Cheers,
Dave.
