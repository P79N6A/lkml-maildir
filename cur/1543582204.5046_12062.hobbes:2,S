Not really. IBM has software which can make the drive available if you
need the BIOS to detect (if you want to boot from it) which "works for
my sister", on an old PCChips M577 (IBM 6x86 MX/233).

It's very low. I've never tried hooking my IBM to my Tyan Trinity K6-2
board because, reportedly, that one crashes with drives larger than 36
GB as well (Award 4.51 crap), and the board only has FreeBSD on its
attached disks.
sudo /sbin/hdparm -X69 -t /dev/hde
/dev/hde:
 setting xfermode to 69 (UltraDMA mode5)
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  1.79 seconds = 35.75 MB/sec
/dev/hde:
 setting xfermode to 66 (UltraDMA mode2)
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  2.70 seconds = 23.70 MB/sec
This is on a Promise PDC 20265R. On VIA, you might not get more than
like 18 MB/s.

It does not tell anything about DMA here,

but here, it's using multi-word DMA. Why don't you set UDMA? Try -X66
-d1.
If your kernel does not have the IDE patches, get them from
ftp.XX.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/hedrick/ and rebuild your
kernel and see if that helps.
