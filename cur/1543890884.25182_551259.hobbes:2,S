This one is a fatal error ... the code is trying to call a function
that has been marked __exit in a driver that has been built-in, instead
of as a module.  Since a builtin driver can never be unloaded, the kernel
has thrown away all the __exit routines (at link time).
The error message appears less than helpful in tracking down which
routine in which driver is the problem though.
