Yes.
Generally the only reason the kernel needs to modify pagecache pages is to
do a quick memset or to copy a string in there or something like that.  So
a quick kmap_atomic/memory copy/kunmap_atomic() cycle is a fairly common
pattern.
The one exception is the directory-in-pagecache code where we tend to do a
lot of stuff while holding the kmap.  Not that there's any particular
reason why we needed to do it that way.

I'd say so, yes.  For a start, kmap_high() takes a global lock.
