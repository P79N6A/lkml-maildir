Hi there.
I have a serious problem.
I am trying to run a GNU/Linux on an emedded system based on AMD Elan SC400.
Whatever I do the system reboots when trying to start a kernel.
I have tried several ways, from using LILO to start the kernel, using
pcinitrd (there is a pcmcia flash card), using loadlin (I can read the card
from DOS) and at last trying (pc)initrd with loadlin (in a looplnx way). But
alas, the loader works, the initrd image get read in but then it reboots.
Does that ring a bell with someone, and could you point me in the right
direction to find out what the problem is and its solution.
Best regards.
