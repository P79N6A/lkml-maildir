Actually we are currently developing HSM application that stacks on top of
standard file system (ext3 and XFS today) and we are using EA to store HSM
specific information with each inode. However, we are not using registration
API, but rather store this in user EA (even if we don't like some
limitations of user EA), because registration API is not exported and
registration API is per-FS and not generic. This would mean that we would
need to have handlers defined for each supported filesystem (ext3 and XFS
today, reiserfs and JFS in near future). As we use user EA, we just call VFS
EA operations of the bottom FS (ext3 or XFS or any other FS that supports
EA).
I agree with your point that this interfaces needs to be exported, but I
would also prefer if they would be generic in terms of being able to
register the same EA handler for each FS supporting EAs (an allowing
extensions/registrations).
I think that we could also then have only single ACL code for both ext2 and
ext3 - currently ACL patch adds similar (same?) code to both ext2 and ext3
and this code could be shared for sure.

Luka
