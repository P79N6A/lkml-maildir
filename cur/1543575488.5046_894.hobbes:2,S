Ok, let's slowly understand each other. The scenario you suggest is:
a) measure nr_free_files and let root exhaust all freelist entries. Now
the freelist is empty and nr_free_files = 0.
b) now let the user app allocate (from the slab cache) lots of new file
structures. He can keep doing so until nr_files hits max_files.
Now what? Now root tries to allocate some and obviously he can't because
the freelist is empty. So what? Where is the bug? This is an expected
behaviour to me -- since the freelist is empty there are no more reserved
file structures for root. Which part of this do you believe is wrong? Or
do you believe that this is not the case at all? I.e. something else
happens in the above scenario which I am still missing? If so, please
explain.
If, however, you believe that the above _is_ the case but it should _not_
happen then you are proposing a completely new policy of file structure
allocation which you believe is superior. It is quite possible so let's
all understand your new policy and let Linus decide whether it's better
than the existing one. But if so, don't tell me you are fixing a bug
because it is not a bug -- it's a redesign of file structure allocator.
