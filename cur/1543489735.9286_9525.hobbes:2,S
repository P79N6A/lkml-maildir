I'm pretty sure that these messages are harmless.  They are generated
when the IDE driver tries to lock the drive door on a "removable" drive
that doesn't support this command.  Depending on kernel version, the
messages may be generated each time the device is opened and closed.
I thought this was fixed in a 2.1 kernel.
