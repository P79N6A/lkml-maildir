Here's a set of serial updates I'm planning to send to Linus shortly.

<rmk@flint.arm.linux.org.uk> (03/09/09 1.1243)
	[SERIAL] Introduce per-port capabilities.
	
	This allows us to maintain quirks or capabilities on a per-port basis,
	so we can handle buggy clones more effectively.
<rmk@flint.arm.linux.org.uk> (03/09/09 1.1242)
	[SERIAL] Fix another missing irqreturn_t (clps711x.c)
<rmk@flint.arm.linux.org.uk> (03/09/09 1.1241)
	[SERIAL] Convert serial config deps to select statements
	
	The dependencies for CONFIG_SERIAL_CORE / CONFIG_SERIAL_CORE_CONSOLE
	were becoming very messy.  This cset converts the dependencies to
	use "select" statements instead.
<rmk@flint.arm.linux.org.uk> (03/09/09 1.1240)
	[SERIAL] Drop "level" argument from serial PM calls.
	
	Since the driver model has transitioned away from using multi-level
	device suspend/resume, we also drop the multi-level support from
	the serial layer.
	
	Update the 8250 and sa1100 drivers for this change.
<rmk@flint.arm.linux.org.uk> (03/08/27 1.1153.59.2)
	[SERIAL] Rename core.o and 8250_cs.o
	
	core.ko is a bad name for a module - make it serial_core.ko
	8250_cs.ko continues to cause people compatibility problems with
	older kernels, so rename that back to serial_cs.ko
<rmk@flint.arm.linux.org.uk> (03/08/24 1.1123.33.1)
	[SERIAL] Add new port numbers.
	
	This adds the new port numbers which are in use in MAC and PARISC
	trees (so other people know they're taken.)
