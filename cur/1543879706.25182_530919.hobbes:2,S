Same here, but I didn't expect it so soon.  Thanks!

I slammed this patch on 2.6.20.6 with some ugly rejects but it did compile, 
then tested, so my results may be affected by the rejects.
Boot into /bin/sh.
Run chew.c on three different VT's with different nice each.  Observe.

It looks like negative nice affects positive nice adversely.

Sounds interresting, but it looks like CPU-bound procs easily steal sleeping 
proc timeslices, thus making it rather unfair, affecting interactivity.
The latencies look great, though.
Also, it may be useful to lower-bound timeslices, as they become ridiculously 
small ( < 1ms ).
Thanks!
