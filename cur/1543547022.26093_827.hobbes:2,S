Why not just do this right, and move the statistics into the "queue
structure". Get rid of that ugly kstat thing. Get rid of all the special
case lookups. We already need to have the queue structure to do the
queuing (surprise, surprise), so suddenly statistics are (a) cheap and (b)
right.
So then /proc just needs to be changed to look at the queues instead of
looking at this kstat thing.
