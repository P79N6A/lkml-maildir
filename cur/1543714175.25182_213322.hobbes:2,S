Hi,
	I was looking at NFS source code and I can't find where the umount
takes place in server side.... It seems nfsd/export.c has some functions
for that, but I added debugging there and nothing happens when umounting
from client/side.Someone could help me ? I read about some rpc.umountd
but was unable to find it on my system ...
Regards,
Fabian
