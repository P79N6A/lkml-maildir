Well, this isn't what your log shows.
According to the log, you booted the computer on March 10 and about 12 
minutes later started getting those -110 errors on the LCD device.  
Then you suspended the computer with no apparent problem.
Two days later you suspended three more times, and the the LCD monitor
was disconnected during the third suspend.  When it came back, you
started getting the errors again.
Next you unplugged and replugged the hub into which the LCD was 
connected.  Again there was another -110 error.  Finally you suspended 
and resumed.
To me that makes it look like the LCD's problems have no connection at
all with suspend/resume.
