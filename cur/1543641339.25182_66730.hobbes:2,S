Unfortunately, that's not true -- I just got an IBM Thinkpad R32
which exhibits the same behaviour as Mike's Dell Inspiron 8100,
it's only a tad worse. When I have the battstat_applet running (which
checks the battery every second), kernel time runs about 3% slow
compared to the RTC (which seems to be half-way accurate on my machine).
The cause seems to be definitely APM. If I shut off battstat_applet
and apmd, kernel time and RTC are in sync. With only apmd, I lose about
15 seconds per hour. With battstat_applet, I lose 2 minutes per hour.
With
  while true; do cat /proc/apm >/dev/null; done
the system runs at about 1/4 of the right speed. Using a kernel with ACPI
eliminates the problem (of course, you lose almost all power management
functionality too).
BTW, I have set CONFIG_APM_ALLOW_INT, and on startup the kernel even says
"IBM machine detected. Enabling interrupts during APM calls." Doesn't
seem to help, though.

I've hacked together a small daemon that tries to adjust the value
and speed of the kernel clock (via adjtimex) to the RTC. An ugly solution,
I know, but better than nothing. If anyone is interested, mail me.
