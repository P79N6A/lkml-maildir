If so, we(Nanhai and myself) will take a look at VMEMMAP changes and see if
the bug that the commit 2e1c49db4c640b35df13889b86b9d62215ade4b6 tries to fix is
still open in the latest git.
But I can't explain how 2e1c49db4c640b35df13889b86b9d62215ade4b6 can be
the root cause of Dave's issue in 2.6.23.
