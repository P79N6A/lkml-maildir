OK, but in this case Linux kernel itself tells me that
something is wrong (via the demsg log). So I am trying
to optimize the system *before* intalling the tons of
tools that I need and discovering later that I may
have  use the incorrect boot option during
installation, requiring me to re-install again.

I just tried that:
Once replacing the 'irqpoll' option (which froze boot
completely, sending tons of lines of the following
error message:
[17179576.748000] hda: cdrom_pc_intr: The drive
appears confused (ireason = 0x01)
And only a hard reset could get me out of there...
The second trial was appending acpi_noirq to the boot
options (i.e. in addition to 'irqpoll') and this time,
it booted. However, demsg still shows that something
is wrong with the system:
[17179569.184000] Kernel command line: root=/dev/sda3
ro quiet splash irqpoll acpi_noirq
[17179569.184000] Misrouted IRQ fixup and polling

[17179569.184000] This may significantly impact system

[17179569.184000] mapped IOAPIC to ffffc000 (fec00000)
But a few lines later:

[17179577.600000] Disabling IRQ #177
And my question is: if the kernel recognizes that the
irqpoll options has been specified, why does it say
"(try booting with the irqpoll option"?
Could this be a kernel bug?
Thanks,
Alex
