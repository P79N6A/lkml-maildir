:-) The thing is that this information is something you access when
something is already going wrong. So avoiding a few possible failure
conditions (e.g. determining the image name either requires a priori
knowledge or depends on the boot loader) seems rather desirable to me.
Or can we have a standard, reasonably reliable way for determining the
path name of the currently running image ? (E.g. for LILO, the command
is  lilo -I `sed '/.*BOOT_IMAGE=\([^ ]*\).*/s//\1/' </proc/cmdline`
But what about GRUB, LOADLIN, SILO, MILO, ... ?)
