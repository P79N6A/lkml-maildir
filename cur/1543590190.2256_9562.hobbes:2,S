I want this feature precisely /because/ it interferes with
packet filtering.
I sleep better knowing that my packet filters are bound to
specific interfaces (with default DENY everywhere).  I like
to know that I can ssh in via the second card on my DB
servers, without worrying about them accepting other traffic
(or performance-vital traffic going over a cheap backup
card).
