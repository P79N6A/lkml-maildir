Which objections were those?  The last submission which I see by Eric
was 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/12/1/15
 this past December.  I see no
response from Al and get the feeling you were ok with them.
So my hunch would be that Eric had addressed those before that last
submission, but if not I'm sorry, and please do set me straight.
thanks,
