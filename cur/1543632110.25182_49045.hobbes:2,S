I ran it through parsemce as suggested (thanks Randy), and got the
following output:
Status: (4) Machine Check in progress.
Restart IP invalid.
parsebank(4): b200000000040151 @ 0
	External tag parity error
	Uncorrectable ECC error
	Correctable ECC error
	Address in addr register valid
	MISC register information valid
	Error overflow
	Memory heirarchy error
	Request: Generic error
	Transaction type : Instruction
	Memory/IO : Reserved
A question for Dave mainly - is this output valid considering that I am
running stock 2.4.18 (I hadn't applied the patch you've done to fix typos
in this - and now I've lost the damn thing).
Does this output give any more information about possible causes?
Also http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=101338603328639&w=2
mentions a tool decodemca - is that a previous name for parsemce?
Thanks again,
Corin
