I just wanted to report a few bugs I've run into while trying out
2.3.34.  I'm running on a Caldera 2.3 system with an upgraded glibc and
modutils.
One problem is that if I configure my kernel without SMP support (which I
would normally do since I only have one processor), lilo reports that the
kernel is too large.  If I enable SMP, which ends up making the kernel
bigger, lilo installs my kernel without any problems.
I also had a little trouble getting my modules to work right.  When I ran
depmod -a, it said that all of my modules had unresolved symbols.  After
recompiling the kernel and rebooting several times, the problem magically
fixed itself; I'm not sure exactly what made it better.
The final error, which is more serious, involves cmpci.  When my system
tries to load the module, it gives up and lsmod reports that cmpci is
"uninitialized."  Here is a dmesg excerpt:
cmpci: version v2.41-nomodem time 21:45:39 Dec 26 1999
