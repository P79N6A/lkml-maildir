Well, pci_get_class() put's the passed-in device and get's() the
returned one. So if you run it in a loop, you should never have to
either get or put. When you exit the loop with a valid pci_dev, though,
you should definitely put() it after you're done with it, but this is
something that should be done only for that specific instance and after
you are finished with it...
