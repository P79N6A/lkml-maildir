Alternatively, if I had (I haven't touched the tree, just format-patch'd
which looked right) used git-reset --hard HEAD and been up to date
(working tree and index file) with whatever ended up being pointed

I'll try to remember the symbolic-ref thing for next time, usually when

adventurous today. :)
