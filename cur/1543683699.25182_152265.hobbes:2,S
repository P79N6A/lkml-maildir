Kernel: 2.6 test1 and test2
using the 8233 ALSA drivers a lot of static can be heard, replacing the
ALSA drivers by the VT82Cxxx OSS driver fixes the static problem.
  Bus  0, device  17, function  5:
  Multimedia audio controller: VIA Technologies, In VT8233 AC97 Audio Co
(rev 80).
  IRQ 11.
  I/O at 0xd800 [0xd8ff].
Is there any existing patch/solution for this problem? (please CC answer
as I am not subscribed to lkml).
