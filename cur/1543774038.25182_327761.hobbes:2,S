Upgrading from 2.6.11 to 2.6.12 caused my 8139cp network card to stop
working. No error messages are emitted and everything seems to work
(from the local computers point of view). But nothing can be recieved
from the network.
Since 8139cp.c hasn't undergone any significant changes between the
versions the bug must be in something related. Any ideas?
