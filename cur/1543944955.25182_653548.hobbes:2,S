Fix direct mapping correctly in ioremap
[This fixes the general ioremap bug I mentioned earlier. It was
fortunately easier to fix that I thought first.]
set_memory_*/cpa is not currently able to resolve ioremap addresses to
their direct mapping aliases.
However uncached ioremap still needs to fix up the direct mapping
to be uncached when the direct mapping happens to overlap
the remapped area. Otherwise there would be a cached mapping
to the uncached ioremap area and that is not allowed in the x86
architecture.
Do this explicitely in ioremap() by passing the direct mapping
address to cpa and ignoring the error if the address wasn't
in the direct mapping.
