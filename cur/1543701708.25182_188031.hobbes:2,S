ISTR that SunOS 4.0 handled an NFS-mounted /dev and swap just fine some 15
years ago? (in fact, due to performance differences between the disks on a Sun3/
2xx server and the shoebox disk on a 3/50, you could page faster over the net
than to a local /dev/swap).
So it's more a case of "we have decided to do it differently" than "that's so nuts
that it shouldn't be expected to work"....
