Well userspace can still modify in this case. So you could still get a
\0 mid buffer but that seems harmless.

Better this doesn't exist as it is a wrapper for a bad habit that isnt
yet used so why encourage it.

What if n is very large ? Should use strnlen_user clipped by n
Also say the length limit is 8 and the text is "hello\0"
We get length = 5  5 < 8, alloc 5 bytes set 5th to \0 and return "hell
\0"
