It would be really nice to have some arch hooks that can fault in user
addresses for read and/or write, and rip all this code out of futex.c
Even more fundamentally, I suspect the futex code might be able to be
implemented without holding mmap_sem or hb locks over the atomic op,
which would be nice. But that would be a much bigger job than simply
implementing fault_in_pages_writeable in a general manner.
