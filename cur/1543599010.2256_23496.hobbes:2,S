I think it could be even easier. We simply count for each
file how many pages we read-ahead and how many pages we
read.
If the number of pages being read-ahead is really a lot
higher than the pages being read, we know pages get evicted
before we read them ==> we shrink the readahead window.
This simpler scheme should also be able to correctly set
the readahead window for slower data streams to smaller
than the readahead window size for faster reading data
streams (which _do_ get to use more of their data before
it is evicted again).
regards,
Rik
