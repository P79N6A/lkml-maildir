Subject: [PATCH] 2.5.70: add info to spinlock debugging
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Hi all,
- directly print out in_atomic() and irqs_disabled() values to ease debugging
- add comment from original patch submission in order to be able to actually
  know what this is all about...
Not sure whether that's an absolutely brilliant idea, but I think it's
useful.
Patch against vanilla 2.5.70.
