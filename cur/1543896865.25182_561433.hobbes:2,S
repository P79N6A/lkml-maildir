Of course, I was just trying to give you an example.

Yes, one of them works in real time, the other one does not.

In your opinion ? Who between a few hundred lines function designed to fit
all needs, and a specific MPEG player is the most aware that the MPEG player
is very likely to require real time scheduling by nature ? At least, the old
version of mplayer I have on my machine (1.0pre7) has a "-priority" option.
Also, I remember that cdrecord automatically tries to go realtime in order
to avoid underrunning the buffer.

"fair" means what it means : stop starving some tasks for no apparent reasons.
If one task adjusts its priority, it can get more CPU than others, but the
distribution will still be fair according to the priorities.

No, I cannot agree with you. The users have to solutions to start their player:
  - typing "mplayer xxx.mpeg" on the command line ; then they can prepend
    "nice" in front of it
  - clicking on an icon in their windows-like window managers, which makes
    executes the command for them.
If they decide to use the second solution, it means that the default settings
assigned to the icon should fit the application (that applies to the nice
value too). And if their distro ships with those pre-defined icons with stupid
priorities, they should complain to the distro vendor or switch to another one.
And if the window manager by itself does not make it easy to adjust priorities
when starting processes, it's poorly designed because it is it and only it
which forces the user to open a command line and manually set "nice".
So there are plenty of really transparent solutions for the user, but maybe
there are a lot of wrong tools and configurations...
