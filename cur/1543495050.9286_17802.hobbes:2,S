Hmmm... I doubt people missed this file.
Not speaking for linux but for my personal experience, it seems that most
people that use stupid Coding Style do not want to change for a better
one. It seems that they often have been victimized by some bloated editor
that shoe-horned its way stupid default Coding Style to newbies at the
time they are unable to configure their em^Hditor properly.
