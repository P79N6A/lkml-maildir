Indeed, it's not really for the list. However, it _does_
seem to be a very frequently asked question...
Now here is my question: would there be any interest in
a mailing list, website or whatever to discuss these
things so we don't "have to" discuss them here any more?
I'll gladly host the list/site/whatever if I get at least
20 people interested in participating on the list and/or
provide content for a site. Please reply by _private_
email...
Rik
