I don't believe the ethernet interface remained, but the module use
count definitely did not drop to zero. I suppose it's possible it's an
issue with the scripts, but the same scripts work perfectly under
2.4.21, which is what I primarily use on my laptop.

This was under the Linux framebuffer; inserting the card was the first
thing I did after it displayed the login prompt.

I am attaching the dmesg output after booting 2.6.0-test2; this does
not include the insertion of the Orinoco card as the console freezes
immediately after the event. I inspected my logs after a reboot and
there were no messages whatsoever regarding the event of the insertion
of the Orinoco card.
