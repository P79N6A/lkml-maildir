When I was RE the ATI IDCT stuff a few years ago, someone at ATI told
me that the problem was that the company they licensed the IDCT stuff
from wouldn't let them give out any specs.  I may be remembering this
wrong since it was a long time ago...
Duncan.
PS: At some point I changed hardware, and didn't need the IDCT anymore.
I just tried to find my notes on it, but there only seems to be some
stuff about the tv tuner...
