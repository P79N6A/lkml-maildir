Version 2.5.5 of perfctr, the Linux/x86 performance
monitoring counters driver, is now available at the usual
place: 
http://www.csd.uu.se/~mikpe/linux/perfctr/
x86-64 users please note that the 2.5.71 kernel won't
compile on x86-64 due to incomplete 'driver model' changes.
A patch to fix this and two other x86-64 bugs is in the
patch-x86_64-2.5.71 file in perfctr's download directory.
Version 2.5.5, 2003-06-15
- Updates for driver model changes in kernel 2.5.71.
- Minor updates to the library's event descriptions for Pentium 4.
- Now supports SuSE's 2.4.19.SuSE-206 kernel for SLES 8 users.
  Autodetection of SuSE kernel versions is not yet implemented:
  pass "--patch=2.4.19.SuSE-206" to perfctr's update-kernel script
  to ensure that the correct patch is applied.
- Patch kit updates for 2.4.21 final and 2.4.20-18 RH kernels.
