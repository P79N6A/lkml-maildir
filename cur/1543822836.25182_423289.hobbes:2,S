Pulled. 
However, please fix your scripts:

Nobody should use "rsync:", it's just more pain for everybody these days. 
If you use rsync, and miss an object, because the mirroring was 
incomplete, you'll never know, you'll just have a strange corrupted 
archive.
Use rsync if you mirror things, but not for git.
So please make that read "git://git.kernel.org/.." instead.
