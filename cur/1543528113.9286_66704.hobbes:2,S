some bugs in kiobufs in 2.3.48, one of them thanks to me.
1. in get_page_map() in mm/memory.c,
struct page * get_page_map(struct page *page, unsigned long vaddr)
{
        if (MAP_NR(vaddr) >= max_mapnr)
                return 0;
        if (page == ZERO_PAGE(vaddr))
                return 0;
        if (PageReserved(page))
                return 0;
        return page;
}
it used to be MAP_NR(page) earlier which was of course wrong. but
vaddr can come from userspace (read/write a raw device), and MAP_NR() on it
is inappropriate. this test fails and we return 0 for any raw device i/o.
2. map_user_kiobuf() which calls the above gets a 0 and ..
...
                map = get_page_map(map, ptr);
                if (map) {
                        if (TryLockPage(map)) {
                                goto retry;
                        }
                        atomic_inc(&map->count);
                }
                spin_unlock(&mm->page_table_lock);
                iobuf->maplist[i] = map;
                iobuf->nr_pages = ++i;
...
the NULL page is entered into iobuf->maplist[]
eventually brw_kiovec() calls set_bh_page() which chokes on the NULL.
I'm not quite sure what should be fixed. stephen ?
