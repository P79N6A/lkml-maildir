A variant on this theme would be (not tested or somewhat, just a
random idea for considering):
1. find if the process is a cpu-hog, if not then ignore
2. find somehow how much time has this process on it's current cpu
3. then, instead of always substracting 1 from th current load on the
current cpu, substract for example 1...0 when running from 0 to 60
seconds... this way cpu hogs would only rotate slowly?
in code:
number_to_sub_from_queue_load = (256 - min(256,
time_from_last_change_of_cpu)) >> 8;
somehow managing to get fixedpoint loadlevels on the runqueues would
make this work better....
