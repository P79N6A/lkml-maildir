That's really wrong. Hmm.. Can you enable debugging for the PCI resource 
stuff? It's DEBUG_CONFIG in drivers/pci/setup-res.c, and DEBUG in 
arch/i386/pci/pci.h, and now your dmesg should be a lot more verbose about 
the bootup resources..
Also (independently - I really do want to see the debug info) can you try
making the "drivers/pci/setup-res.c" version of "insert_resource()" be a
request_resource() too?
Thanks,
