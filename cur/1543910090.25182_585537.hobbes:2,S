Currently we do: 
  dirty = total_dirty * bdi_completions_p * task_dirty_p
As dgc pointed out before, there is the issue of bdi/task correlation,
that is, we do not track task dirty rates per bdi, so now a task that
heavily dirties on one bdi will also get penalised on the others (and
similar issues).
If we were to change it so:
  dirty = cpuset_dirty * bdi_completions_p * task_dirty_p
We get additional correlation issues: cpuset/bdi, cpuset/task.
Which could yield surprising results if some bdis are strictly per
cpuset.
The cpuset/task correlation has a strict mapping and could be solved by
keeping the vm_dirties counter per cpuset. However, this would seriously
complicate the code and I'm not sure if it would gain us much.
Anyway, things to ponder. But overall it should be quite doable.
