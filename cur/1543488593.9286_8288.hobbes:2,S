Subject: 2.2.1 (possibly others as well): loosing 2 ticks even under light load

Hello, a notifier:
For debugging purposes I added a print statement to show lost ticks 
in the i386 kernel. On my Pentium 100 even for very light load the 
kernel declares having lost 2 ticks.
I don't know why this happend, but I see a problem: If the kernel 
looses 2 ticks on a light load, it might loose more ticks on heavy 
load. Unfortunately the non-TSC version of the timeoffset routine 
(using the timer chip's register) can only span one tick, possibly 
guessing that there's more than one, but not more.
Therefore losing over 1 tick might cause a bad time.
I have no idea how to find the parts that disable interrupts for that 
long...
Regards,
Ulrich
