Hi Alan, James
	This is what i have so far, i'll probably have time to really 
debug it when i get home later today. The problem persists with Jame's 
Summit patch applied too (just in case there were other fixes there).
Intel MultiProcessor Specification v1.4
    Virtual Wire compatibility mode.
OEM ID: OEM00000 Product ID: 0.1          APIC at: 0xFEE00000

ENABLING IO-APIC IRQs
Setting 4 in the phys_id_present_map
...changing IO-APIC physical APIC ID to 4 ... ok.
..TIMER: vector=0x31 pin1=0 pin2=-1
<dead>
Around here the machine gets a vector 0x31 (timer) interrupt on CPU0 then 
locks up since the destination cpu bitmask is 0, It also seems that the 
code is trying to use logical apic id in places instead of the physical 
apic id, i saw attempted deliveries to physical apic id 4 and 8, this can 
possibly explain the APIC receive errors people were reporting? 
Unfortunately this is the only info i have right now, i thought i'd be 
able to gather more but looks like i'll have to wait till i get home.
As a control, the machine boots and runs 2.4.19-rc2
Regards,
	Zwane Mwaikambo
Alan on a side note, would you like a patch to bring around some fixes 
from 2.5 irq_balance? Your kernel can't boot UP w/ IOAPIC
