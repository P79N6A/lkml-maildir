Wouldn't that just cause problems in France based on previous posts
content. It would be better IMO to build in the hook then supply a
compression algorithm. Then there are no download problems, it is
obviously a compression hook and not a crypto hook as we have supplied an
algorithm for compression. Love to see a lawyer prove that the compression
routine is actually a substitute for a crypto algorithm :-)
