This is an important difference, so I'd like to make sure I fully
understand the scope. Ok, so bi_sector for partitions will be
disk relative, not partition relative. I'll assume that bi_sector
will be set inside of submit_bh. So top level block devices always
see something that is disk relative. Is this change ONLY for
partitions? And if not, how will this affect what top and
intermediate levels of stacked block devices receive for a
bi_sector value? If I had MD on LVM on partitions, what would
bi_sector value initially be relative to? The MD device, the
LVM device, or the disk underlying the partitions? It seems it
would need to be set relative to the MD device. If so, then either
partitions or MD/LVM (non-partition devices) would seem to have to
be special cased. I could continue going on making assumptions and
theorizing the affects, but I'll stop here and wait for your
clarification on how you see things working.
