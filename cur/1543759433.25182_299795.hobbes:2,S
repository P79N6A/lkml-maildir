My impression about your releases is that -rc1 is a first snapshot, but 
there are still invasive changes until -rc3 or -rc4 when you _really_ 
say "only obvious bug fixes will be accepted".
It's _only about naming_:
Name the first one -pre1 instead of -rc1 and the snapshot you announce 
with "only obvious bug fixes will be accepted" -rc1.
It might not matter for you how it's called, but it does matter for 
other people and it doesn't cost you any extra effort.

If I send a non-bugfix patch to Marcelo after 2.4.30-rc1 he'll say:
  "Thanks, queued for 2.4.31 ."
