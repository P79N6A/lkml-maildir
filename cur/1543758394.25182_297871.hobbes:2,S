I am not familiar with watchdogs. I'd invite you to get in touch with
the author and/or maintainer of the w83627hf_wdt driver, or possibly try
to debug it yourself. Datasheets are freely available from Winbond for
both the W83627HF and W83627THF:

I do not own a system with either chip myself, so I can hardly help. (If
anyone wants to donate a system with either chip so that I can work on
this, just contact me.)
