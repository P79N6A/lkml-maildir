Marcelo,
This is a backport of the fix Linus dropped into the 2.5 tree.  Can you
put this into 2.4?
Linus' abstract:
> Make in-kernel inode 'nlink' field be "unsigned int" instead
> of something arch-dependent and usually less.
>
> We may want to do value limiting in generic_fillattr() if people
> end up caring.
Of course, 2.4 doesn't have generic_fillattr.  This would be cp_old_stat
and cp_new_stat.
Thanks,
Shaggy
