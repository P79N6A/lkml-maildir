No, it's not. The patch below fixes the place where we get eflags, this
triggered the "BUG while gdb'ing" reports.
The one I sent was to fix a problem that only I reported, AFAIK: when
you use gdb/ptrace to modify %fs, the value gets written in the wrong
place (see gdb sessions). So, unless you have another patch fixing the
way putreg() writes %fs, the patch[1] I sent should also be queued for
mainline.
