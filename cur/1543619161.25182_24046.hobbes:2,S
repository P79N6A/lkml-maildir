Ok, I mailed Rob privately in support of this; now I'm saying it
publicly: I support this. (And I thought it well written.)
I've submitted small patches for things as I have gotten the chance.  I
submitted those to Alan because they were small fixes.  He gave feedback
(Thanks Alan!) and I tried to fix things better.  He took care of
feeding Linus--something I'm not in a possition to do.
I believe we need a patch-penguin or something similar.  Linus wants
subsystem maintainers... maybe make an official bugfix-maintainer? 
Whoever it is needs to be officially recognized by Linus and probably
featured on /. or something so people who create those 3-4 line patches
that fix a bug that bit them will know not to mail Linus.
(Returning to the shadows where I belong... ;) )
