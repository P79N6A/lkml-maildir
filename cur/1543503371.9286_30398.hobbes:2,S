If you fill your machine with too many jobs and if swap exceeds RAM by a large
factor that's bound to happen. As long as you can find it out, kill the jobs
and incarcerate the user it's OK.
I don't want to have that 'repaired' since I don't see how that can be
repaired. If you want some pages locked into memory you can do that I guess.
All I'm trying to achieve in this OOM discussion is that my machine
(desktop or batch) survives an 'attack' by multiple large user jobs with all
system jobs intact.

In order for that to work the following requirement must be fulfilled:
     maximum number of jobs / user   *   maximum survival job size
                                                           < RAM + swap
where
    maximum survival job size = the maximum size of all jobs necessary
    for the survival (e.g. rlogind, bash, ...)
That means that the fork bombs have to grow above the maximum survival job
size to be harmful to the machine, and so the 'survival' jobs will likely
survive since the fork bombs will get killed.
Not that I care for the malicious case a lot.
My 'malicious' jobs are often my own.
