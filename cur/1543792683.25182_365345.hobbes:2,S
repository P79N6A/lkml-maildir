Perhaps you could teach your mailer how to attach the atachments so that they appear inline to the 
reader.  The problem appears to be that it does not recognize the file type.  This is what it says:
Content-Type: application/octet-stream; name="linux-2.6.14-nlkd-time.patch"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64
Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="linux-2.6.14-nlkd-time.patch"
where as a correct attachment might look something like:
Content-Type: text/x-diff;
   charset="us-ascii";
   name="patch_x86_64-kernel-i8259"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Content-Disposition: attachment;
	filename="patch_x86_64-kernel-i8259"
This would allow us to comment on the patch with said comments appearing in the body of the patch.
