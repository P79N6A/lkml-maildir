The warnings are way off track, because
1. /dev/hd* means ide-cd which has never had the incriminated bugs,
   no matter if badly designed or not
2. you can't tell from looking at /dev/sg* or the b,t,l if the device
   node is operated by the ide-scsi or sg drivers. Both use the unified
   /dev/sg* namespace.
In fact, it makes sense to suppress the warning for /dev/hd* and ATA:
which are known good.
