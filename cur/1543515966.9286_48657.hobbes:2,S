I can give figures for flush_page_to_ram() on MIPS where a cache
instructions costs like 13 cycles + eventual pipeline stalls due to
SysAD bus contention.  Not counting loop overhead that's at least 1664
cycles or even 3228 cycles on machines with 16 byte l1 caches.  Definately
worth to take care of.
