Please don't store err_mask into int rc.  Please store it to a separate
err_mask variable and report it when printing error message.

Wouldn't -EIO be more appropriate?

Not NACKing.  Just notes for future improvements.  We need to be more
careful here.  ATA/ATAPI world is filled with braindamaged devices and I
bet there are devices which advertises it can do AN but chokes when AN
is enabled.
This should be handled similarly to ACPI failure.  Currently ACPI does
the following.
1. try once, if fail, record that ACPI failed.  return error to trigger
retry.
2. try again, if fail again, ignore error if possible (!FROZEN) and turn
off ACPI.
This fallback mechanism for optional features can probably be
generalized and used for both ACPI and AN.
