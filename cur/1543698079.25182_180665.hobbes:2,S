Let me continue to stress: geometry DOES exist.
It is an abstract construct that is stored in your BIOS that some
configurations use and need for booting.

The geometry can be changed in many BIOSes.

But the way it writes the partition table is affected by what it
believes the geometry to be.  If its beliefs don't match the BIOS,
there can be trouble.  However, since fdisk isn't typically used to
resize Windows partitions, you don't see problems so much.

You mean "modern software".  I'm not sure how true this is.  Have you
got any evidence?
(i.e. have you got any evidence that, say, that 99.x% of Windows XP
installations use LBA to bootstrap?)

Exactly.
Moreover, booting can fail while reading the file system.  I reverse
engineered several of the Microsoft boot loaders (Windows
95/9x/ME/2000/NT).  The boot sector understands FAT, and depending
on the configuration, may use CHS to load in info.
I wrote about this in the doc/FAT file in the Parted tarball.
