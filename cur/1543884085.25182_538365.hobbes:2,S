These two conditions seem a little confusing.
If ca->next_interval_check > (now - INTERVAL), the else part
is executed, but if ca->next_interval_check > (now - INTERVAL)
then ca->next_interval_check > now, which implies we return
and never enter the else part. It's been quite sometime since
I looked at this code, so I might have gotten it wrong.
I see a load of 0% on my powerpc box. I think it is because
last_interval_time is always 0, I'll debug further
