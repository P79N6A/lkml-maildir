(Sorry for letting that last message off w/o a subject, so I'm double
posting.) 
Gentlemen,
I've been puzzled.  I've got a tape drive (OnStream) on ide1 which
detected but 'disappears' by the time the boot is finished (i.e. it's not
listed in /proc/devices).  Here's an except from dmesg:
PIIX3: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev 39
PIIX3: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later
    ide0: BM-DMA at 0xf000-0xf007, BIOS settings: hda:pio, hdb:pio
    ide1: BM-DMA at 0xf008-0xf00f, BIOS settings: hdc:pio, hdd:pio
hda: WDC AC21000H, ATA DISK drive
hdb: WDC AC22500L, ATA DISK drive
ide0 at 0x1f0-0x1f7,0x3f6 on irq 14
hda: WDC AC21000H, 1033MB w/128kB Cache, CHS=525/64/63, DMA
hdb: WDC AC22500L, 2441MB w/256kB Cache, CHS=620/128/63, (U)DMA
md driver 0.36.6 MAX_MD_DEV=4, MAX_REAL=8
Partition check:
 hda: hda1 hda2 hda3
 hdb: hdb1
I'm running 2.2.13 with Gadi Oxman's 1.16e ide-tape.c.  I've tried both as
a module (which I'd prefer) and compiled into the kernel.
Why does ide1 disappear?  Can I force it to stay around?  Is that my
problem?  
Regards,
