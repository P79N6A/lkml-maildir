Aside from what Ahmed said about about rootless systems, the per-process
encryption reduces the window of opportunity for attackers who gain root
(or physical access).
Try strings(1) on your swap device.  You'll be surprised at what you find.
You'll probably recognize passwords you haven't useds for a long time, and
a lot of other stuff you didn't expect.  Sometimes you can find whole ssh
sessions there, plaintext.  (think xterm scroll buffer).
With per-process encryption, even if root decides to read the swap at some
point (evil admin or an attacker who 0wn3d the box), the leakage is
limited to processes currently running.
