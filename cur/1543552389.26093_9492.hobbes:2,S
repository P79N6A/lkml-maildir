You can stop at the word DPT... the linux kernel I2O driver is not compat.
with _any_ DPT I2O RAID controller.  Alan should set the kernel code to
ignore DPT cards entirely.
Use DPT's "dpt_i2o" driver available from somewhere deep in an ftp server.
Or grab the 1.09 version converted for use with 2.4 from me.

Yes, the driver is a bloody mess. (I2O in general is as well.  Who the h***
writes specifications without putting any numbers in them?!)
