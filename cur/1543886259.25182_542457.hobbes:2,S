I think there needs to be both. If we don't have a mechanism to
atomically change the file size with the preallocation, then
applications that use stat() to work out if they need to preallocate
more space will end up racing.

Yes. That is the current XFS implementation for XFS_IOC_UNRESVSP, and
what i did for FA_UNALLOCATE as well.

No - we punch a hole. If you want the filesize to change, then
you use ftruncate() to remove the blocks at EOF and change the
file size atomically.

No, XFS does *not* update a/m/ctime on prealloc/punch unless the file size
changes. If the filesize changes, it behaves exactly the same way that
ftruncate() behaves.
Cheers,
