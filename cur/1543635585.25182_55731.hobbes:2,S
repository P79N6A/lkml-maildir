That's what ioctl() is/was designed for. In user-space, you have
            int ioctl(fd, FUNCTION_NR, parameter);
... where fd is your open file-handle, FUNCTION_NR is whatever you want
to define a specific control for your device, and parameter is usually
a pointer to some parameters (like a buffer).
In the module, you have.
 int any_name(struct inode *ip, struct file *fp, unsigned int command,
unsigned long arg);
    'ip' and 'fp' will probably be ignored in your module.
    'command' is your FUNCTION_NR, and 'arg' is your parameter.
    You cast 'arg' to a pointer of your choice if the user-mode
    code supplies a pointer.
    The address (pointer) of your function goes into the
   'struct file_operations' (7th member) that you pass a pointer
   to when you initialize your device (register_xxxdev()).
   The normal return code is 0. You return a -ERRNO if any errors
   are encountered in your function.
   Typically, you do:
   switch(command)
   {
   case FIRST_FUNCTION:
   ....
   break;
   default:
       return -ESPIPE; // Invalid stuff, lets you still test with
                       // standard text tools (od, hexdump, etc).
   }
Cheers,
