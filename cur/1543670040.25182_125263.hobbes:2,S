Hi,
Pass those net patches to the maintainers (not Alan, not Linus, not
Marcello) and CC netdev (optionally cc lk)?
I dont understand why
-       sch = kmalloc(size, GFP_KERNEL);
+       sch = kmalloc(size, GFP_ATOMIC);
mysteriously fixes the problem? Could the problem be elsewhere?
Can you repost what the issue was? I am not on lk and i just saw the
posting on a web page.
cheers,
jamal
