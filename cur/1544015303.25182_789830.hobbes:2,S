Nothing, really.
The filesystem has mount options (I think).  That interface needs to be
maintained.
More importantly, the filesystem driver has to be able to read older
filesystem instances.  This is a userspace-visible binary interface!
A really complex one.
If for some reason we wish to change the on-disk format then that could
be done now.  But once the code is merged, such changes could only be
done in a back-compatible way.
And the day-one code (ie: this code) would need to be designed so that
such on-disk changes can be made - we don't want old kernels exploding
when asked to read new-layout filesystem instances.  This is what `grep
-i compat include/linux/ext2_fs.h' is all about.
