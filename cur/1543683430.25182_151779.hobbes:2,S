It's a subtle point - let's say you have a 32K blob of data and a 4K block/
erase/whatever size on the flash.   If you write it uncompressed, then 8 blocks
are going to get an erase cycle.  If however you can compress it down to 12K
(not at all unusual for text), then only 3 blocks get an erase cycle, and the
other 5 blocks get to live longer...
