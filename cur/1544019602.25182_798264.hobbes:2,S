Subject: [PATCH 106/114] x86/Voyager: remove ISA quirk
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Voyager has this ISA quirk (because Voyager has no ISA support):
 config ISA
 	bool "ISA support"
	depends on !X86_VOYAGER
There's a ton of x86 hardware that does not support ISA, and because
most ISA drivers cannot auto-detect in a safe way, the convention in
the kernel has always been to not enable ISA drivers if they are not
needed.
Voyager users can do likewise - no need for a Kconfig quirk.
