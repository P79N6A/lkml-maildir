Greetings David,
I am using you problem as the example for the world, You need to split the
Maxtor WDC pair before you corrupt your FS!!!!
Everyone this is the classic case stated many times but no examples.
This one is different in that irq's are lost only and FS is not destroyed.
Since the ASIC timing modes on the Maxtor are better than that of the WDC,
and it is the faster drive, the error is minor.
This is only because the order is Maxtor then WDC.  If the order was
reversed WDC the Maxtor, you would watch the two destroy each other.
One should never mix a UDMA Maxtor with DMA WDC, the chatter of the
timings will kill.
Alan, I include you so you would catch this example.
