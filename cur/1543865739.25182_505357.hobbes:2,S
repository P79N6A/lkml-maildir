No, that's *really* it ;)
The cookie you pass, and the return code of the syscall.
If there other data transfered? Sure, but that data transfered during the 
syscall processing, and handled by the syscall (filling up a sys_read 
buffer just for example).

Did I miss something? The async() syscall will allow (with few 
restrictions) to execute whatever syscall in an async fashion. An syscall 
returns a result code (long). Plus, you need to pass back the 
userspace-provided cookie of course. A cookie is very likely a direct 
pointer to the userspace session the async syscall applies to, so a
"(my_session *) results[i].cookie" will bring you directly on topic.
Collection of multiple sources? What do you mean? What's wrong with:
int async_wait(struct asys_completion *results, int nresults);
Is saving an 8/16 bytes double copy worth going wacko in designing shared 
userspace/kernel buffers, when the syscall that lays behind an 
asys_completion is prolly touching KBs of RAM during its execution?
