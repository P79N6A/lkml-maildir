show socket() call please to see what proto and type you have there.

ERESTARTSYS might be returned from system calls only when signal is pending.
Signal handler will change ERESTARTSYS to proper userspace error, i.e.
ERESTARTSYS (512) must not leak to userspace.
Some fail paths returns ERESTARTSYS even if no signal is pending and that used
to be the point.
