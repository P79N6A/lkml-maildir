Yes, but that misses the point.  The point is that you have to do the same
work, almost, to switch a kernel thread as a process.  You don't have to
switch the VM context but that isn't the dominating term.  So the fact that
Sun has slow[er] context switching and slow[er] thread switching isn't the
issue.  The issue is that people perceive threads to be cheap but they are
not cheap at all.  It's the relative cheapness, or lack thereof, when 
comparing them to processes.
