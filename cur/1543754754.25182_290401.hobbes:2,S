Hi!
I'm sending you a few fixes hopefully for the 2.6.11 release. They
should fix reboot problems due to the BIOS not expecting the i8042
controller to be in MUX mode, problems with incorrectly assigned buttons
on mice with horizontal scroll wheels, spurious kernel messages and
endless message loops on disconnect of HID devices on UHCI controllers,
and some nuances regarding MSC_SCAN events generation for future tools
for assigning keycodes to scancodes.
You can pull the whole set, including merge changesets from
	bk://kernel.bkbits.net/vojtech/for-linus
I'll be sending a larger bunch of patches sometime soon, but those
aren't as urgent as these six.
