Screen works nicely.  Do this:
    echo 'defutf8 on' >> ~/.screenrc
Then screen presents a UTF-8 interface to the shell and other
programs, regardless of what kind of terminal you connect from :)
(It's a bit overkill, no actually it's a lot overkill, and you have the
annoyance of screen intercepting at least one commonly used editing key.)
(Just remember to set the LANG environment variable to include
".UTF-8" so that screen-oriented programs know to display properly.  I
do it automatically using a script which queries the current terminal,
to workaround ssh not forwarding LANG).

Emacs does, of course.
