Yes, that's it.
Using smbfs, both files have the same size and contents even though
they're really different:
$ ll ipt_dscp* ipt_DSCP*
-r--r-----  1 me me 2753 Jan 29  2004 ipt_dscp.c
-r--r-----  1 me me 2753 Jan 29  2004 ipt_DSCP.c
$ ll ipt_dscp.c ipt_DSCP.c
-r--r-----  1 me me 2753 Jan 29  2004 ipt_dscp.c
-r--r-----  1 me me 2753 Jan 29  2004 ipt_DSCP.c
With cifs, a directory search shows different sizes but opening
them by name gives identical contents:
$ ll ipt_dscp* ipt_DSCP*
-r-------- 1 me me 1581 Jan 28  2004 ipt_dscp.c
-r-------- 1 me me 2753 Jan 29  2004 ipt_DSCP.c
$ ll ipt_dscp.c ipt_DSCP.c
-r-------- 1 me me 1581 Jan 28  2004 ipt_dscp.c
-r-------- 1 me me 1581 Jan 28  2004 ipt_DSCP.c
$ diff ipt_dscp.c ipt_DSCP.c
$
So where is the bug? On the server?
