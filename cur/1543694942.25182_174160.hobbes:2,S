I thought both ext2 and ext3 do handle bad-blocks. They just
don't make them owned by a "file" because the Unix file-systems
don't require dummy directory entries.
If the respondent wants them isolated into a "BADBLOCKS" file,
he can make a utility to do that. It's really quite easy because
you can raw-read disks under Linux, plus there is already
the `badblocks` program that will locate them.
