hm.  sys_write() takes a local copy of f_pos and writes that back into the
struct file.  It does this so that two concurrent write() callers don't
make a mess of f_pos, and of the file contents.
Perhaps ecryptfs should be calling vfs_write()?
That way we'd also get the fsnotify notifications, which ecryptfs presently
appears to have subverted.
