I say I believe scalability will not be a huge issue, because for
concurrent faulters on the same page, they still have cacheline
contention beginning before we lock the page (tree_lock), and
ending after we unlock it (page->_count), and a few others in the
middle for good mesure. I sure don't think it is going to help,
but I don't think it would be a great impact on an alrady sucky
workload.
We would have contention against other sources of lock_page, but
OTOH, we want to fix up the clear_page_dirty_for_io race window
by doing a wait_for_page_locked here anyway.
We could introduce some contention for some other lockers... but
again I think they are often situations where the page fields are
going to be modified anyway, or where the fault code would be
contending on something anyway (eg. vs !uptodate read, truncate).
The lock hold time in the fault should be smaller than many.
I'm not saying it would never be contended, but it is such a
granular thing and it is so often surrounded by file level locking.

OK, I haven't proven to eliminate the overhead completely, but we can
see that options exist... And we should be able to at least help the
more heavily impacted powerpc architecture and bring the hit it to a
more reasonable level there.

Well I value your opinion of course, and I don't want to change the
VM in a way that people are not unhappy with :)

That's definitely what I had in mind -- the page lock is a simple
starting point (that is hopefully correct) that we would always be
able to build on with something more fancy in future.

A little bit :)
