Cool. Since you think I am wrong and stubborn and intransigent about
pakis, I'd gladly pay a two way fare for your wife or daughter to
travel/stay alone in the pro-Taliban areas of northern pak. Amazing how
quickly an offer like that shuts up all the politically-correct folks.
The real point of my email was that almost everyone has a slightly
differing viewpoint of how the real world AND the software world should
be arranged. I think pakis suck and you don't. Fine.
RMS's intransigence is hurting the open source movement at a time when
his past leadership shows how much he can help. A little flexibility on
his part would be a tremendous boost.
