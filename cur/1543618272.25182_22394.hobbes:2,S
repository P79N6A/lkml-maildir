I'm looking for some old code from March 2000 mentioned in the "Linux
loading Linux" thread from the LKML:
	
http://www.uwsg.indiana.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0003.2/1339.html
Briefly, the module would load a new kernel image, ramdisk, command line
etc. by trying to put the system back into a post-firmware state and
launch the kernel.  It apparently lacked support for SMP systems.
The original link to the code is now a dead-end: 
	
http://www.scyld.com/software/monte.html
and the original author is unreachable by the address listed.
If you've got a copy of the code stashed somewhere, or if you know of
more recent work in this area, I would appreciate a pointer.
Thanks,
Andy Pfiffer
