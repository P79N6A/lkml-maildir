I have an A7V600 too, with a Athlon 2100+. I found that the 2.4 kernel 
support (2.4.20 ... 22) was not up to it also, and switched to try the 
2.6.0-t9 kernel; this has, so far, proved fairly stable, with the 
exception of a might_sleep problem on the plug-in PCI IEEE1394 card I have.
I noticed that, with 2.4, the kernel was treating the KT600 chipset as a 
KT400 chipset: I don't know if this has changed in later editions of 
2.4, but it seemed to be an undesireable thing to do, which partly 
prompted my shift to 2.6
I too tried updating the BIOS to 1005; it does seem to fix a power-up 
problem (originally the BIOS would sometimes claim that a hardware fault 
had happened which hadn't hapened) but there still seem to be issues 
with the SATA ports: drives on them are never listed in the BIOS boot 
sequence, and unless I do a cold-boot (i.e. cable-unplugged, not just 
'off') the SATA drives aren't visible at all to the BIOS or to Linux.
One of these days I'll get around to filing a bug report about the SATA 
stuff with ASUS. Should it make a difference, the drives I@m using are 
Seagate 7200.7 120GB/8MB.
Regards,
Ruth
