   "shm_segsz" might be flipped, yes.
This is what I was referring to.
The change being mentioned in this discussion cannot happen as-is.
You should add a new system call entry which provides the new ABI,
and preserve the old ABI in the existing entry.  Or find some other
method to export the new functionality.
You cannot simply change the ABI and still use the old system call
entry, this is not an option.
