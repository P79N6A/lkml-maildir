There is no "preferred", just one good and one bad :-)
Ideally, you should use tabs only for indentation, and spaces only for
alignment. Keep in mind that there are people using different tab sizes
and that your tabs should not make it harder for them to read your code.
In your example above, you should use tabs from left up to "err", then
spaces to go from "err" to "arg_d".
However, we know that some editors such as emacs are stupid in this regard,
because they fill with tabs then complete with spaces, so it's not always
easy.
