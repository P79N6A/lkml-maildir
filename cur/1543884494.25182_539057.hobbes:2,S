Just got through testing this patch. Unfortunately, this panic seems to much
more difficult for me to reproduce all of a sudden. I saw it quite a few
times at connectathon, but I've tried to get it to occur on fairly recent
kernels today and haven't been able to. Perhaps some other change is papering
over it somehow.
The patch doesn't seem to break anything, but I can't really confirm whether
it fixes these oopses. Still, it seems like a sensible change AFAICT...
