Sure. (it's 10x worse, but the crystals aren't good
enough to tell the difference) Supposing that a
choice near 1000 HZ is good, here are some more:
wrongness_%   HZ_diff   PIT_#   HZ     actual_HZ   
-0.00217900  -0.021703   1198   996   995.978297
-0.00083809  -0.008389   1192  1001  1000.991611
-0.00050285  -0.006376    941  1268  1267.993624
+0.00050286  +0.005396   1112  1073  1073.005396
+0.00150859  +0.014950   1204   991   991.014950
I think it's better to drop down a bit, because people
have also been suffering problems with lost ticks.
The BIOS can grab the CPU for too long.
We need to deal well with a few different frequencies:
100    the old clock tick
59.94  NTSC field rate
50     PAL field rate
The theory is that you need a frequency of just over 2x
the one you'd like, but in practice you need about 4x.
So that's why I suggested 363, 519, and 627.
I'd really rather just run everything off the RTC or HPET,
with an arbitrary rate interrupt source, and just call into
the regular jiffies handling code as needed to catch up.
This would allow steering the jiffies tick to an exact
integer HZ. High-precision timers could be fired off of
the RTC or HPET interrupt if that is running faster.
