That's not the final fix Andi.  The final fix was to add this chunk
about the send_llinfo test:
	if (saddr == NULL) {
		if (ipv6_get_lladdr(dev, &addr_buf))
			return;
		saddr = &addr_buf;
	}
And remove that chunk of code later in the function.  This is what
you'll find in 2.4.5-preX current.
You made the diff with a CVS tree, so I have no idea how you could
have gotten the old change.
Later,
