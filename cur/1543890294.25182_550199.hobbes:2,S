This is a matter of one's philosophy.  In suspend-to-RAM, should tasks
be frozen or should I/O queues be frozen?
With the USB subsystem I have followed the approach taken by the PM
core, which is that tasks are frozen.  But one can -- and Linus has on
at least one occasion -- make a good case that tasks should be left
running while only I/O is frozen.  This would require the subsystem to
distinguish between a selective device suspend and a system-wide
suspend-to-RAM, so that selective resume could be enabled on demand in
one case but not the other.
It's quite doable in principle -- it's just not the technique I used.
