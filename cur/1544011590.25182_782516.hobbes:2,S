Damn, acked git-send-email prompting for the email addr with 'y' instead
of just tapping enter.
The bad thing is that 'reply' doesn't work.
The good thing is that git-send-email added my address to every mail
sent out, so you should be able to figure nevertheless.
Really time for some vacation days.
Happy x-mas everybody and sorry for the inconvenience,
