Your patch works fine for resetting the NIC. There are some a one or two
log messages coming up, but the transfer continues after a small delay.
It doesn't solve the (less urgent) problem of not being able the use the
NIC after a warm boot in M$ Windows. As I said, pulling the power cord from
the ATX power supply and reinserting it, makes it go away.

It's rather much to post the the mailing list, I think, so I've put it online
at [
http://win-www.uia.ac.be/u/s965817/via-rhine.report/
]. If you prefer
otherwise, just tell me. I can always send a tarball of the logs.
Some explanation of the logs:
report: script for creating the device status dumps
hang/:      about the "timed out" problem receiving much data
    242/:      using the default module from 2.4.2 release
         before/:   device status before the lock, while NIC works well
         after/:    device status after the lock, during timeout messages
    242patch/: using the patched version
         before/:   device status before the timeout or wicked messages
         after/:    device status afterwards (NIC keeps working fine)
windoze:/   about the warm-boot-after-windoze problem
    winboot/:  device info booting after warm boot (problem case)
    coldboot/: device info booting after total cold boot (no problem)
Thanks a lot for the patch.
