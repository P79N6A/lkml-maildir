Would've been nice if they worked, but they don't.
Disks should be so easy to identify uniquely, because they have
storage space that can be used for that label.
So I tried (debian linux, last year).
Mount by label was fine, of course.
Until the 33rd reboot, when it was decided that a
fsck was necessary "just to be safe".  The problem was that fsck
fail to find the correct device when /etc/fstab specifies a label
instead of a device. The boot failed, reboot with init=/bin/sh
and replace the dysfunctional labels with oldfashioned device names.
I can live with this kind of problem on my desktop, but this machine
was going to be a internet router for a customer, so occational
boot failure requiring intervention was not an option.
