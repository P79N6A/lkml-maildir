After some further investigation, I think I was mistaken in saying that
the caller of sched_setscheduler() must hold the tasklist_lock.
If you look at the example of sys_setpriority() and sys_nice(), both
of which call set_user_nice(), the first one does so via set_one_prio()
while holding the tasklist_lock, the second one does so while not
holding the tasklist_lock. The difference seems to be whether the caller
was operating against a task_struct located by way of pid or uid (like
calling find_task_by_pid()), which is the case for sys_setpriority(),
whereas sys_nice() operates against the current task_struct.
Now my proposed sched_setscheduler() is very similar to set_user_nice().
And sys_sched_setscheduler()/do_sched_setscheduler() is very similar to
sys_setpriority()/set_one_prio(). And the kernel module (XPC) that I'm
attempting to get accepted by the community would be analagous to
sys_nice() in that its call to sched_setscheduler() would be against
the current task.
So if there is a problem with my proposed patch in regards to the
tasklist_lock, then it would seem to me that there is a problem
with the exiting sys_setpriority(), set_one_prio(), sys_nice(),
set_user_nice() code.
Or am I missing something?
Thanks,
Dean
