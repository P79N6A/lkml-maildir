Now think about files with other formats, for instance the (in)famous
sendmail.cf, or less structured stuff like you find in /etc/init.d/, or
just Postgres databases (with fun stuff like permissions on records and
fields)... or just people groping in /etc/passwd wanting to find the whole
entry (not just one field), or perhaps look at the 15th character of the
entry for John Doe.
This way lies utter madness (what format description should be applied to
what file this time around?). Plus shove all this garbage into the kernel?!
