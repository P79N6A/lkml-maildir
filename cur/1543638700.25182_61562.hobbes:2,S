No, that's the API limit. We use signed 64-bit byte
offsets in our API. (it's just under 8 EiB, which
is about 9.2 EB)
I do see one flaw on my graph. That horizontal line
at 1 TiB ought to be at 2 TiB apparently. It's for
the kernel limit, perhaps only on 32-bit hardware.
This changes the limit with 4096-byte blocks from
1 TiB to 2 TiB, so the filesystem's 4.4 TB is still
out of reach.

If we had quadruple indirection, then we'd hit a 17.6 TB
limit (16 TiB) due to the 32-bit block numbers. With an
8192-byte block size, we'd hit the block number limit
at 35 TB (32 TiB) before hitting the triple-indirection
limit. Of course none of this gets you past the kernel
limit at around 2.2 TB.
I believe we allow 8192-byte blocks on the Alpha.
You might want to look into that. IA-64 maybe too.
