The whole point is, YOU CANNOT DO THIS.
You need to shut the device up. Otherwise it keeps screaming.
Please, people, don't confuse the issue any further. A hardware driver
	ABSOLUTELY POSITIVELY HAS TO
have an in-kernel irq handler that knows how to turn the irq off.
End of story. No ifs, buts, maybes about it.
You cannot have a generic kernel driver that doesn't know about the 
low-level hardware (not with current hardware - you could make the "shut 
the f*ck up" a generic thing if you designed hardware properly, but that 
simply does not exist in general right now).
In short: a user-space device driver has exactly TWO choices:
 - don't use interrupts at all, just polling
 - have an in-kernel irq handler that at a minimum knows how to test 
   whether the irq came from that device and knows how to shut it up.
This means NOT A GENERIC DRIVER. That simply isn't an option on the 
table, no matter how much people would like it to be.
