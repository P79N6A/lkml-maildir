There is no hardware sensor support in the kernel; that is exactly why we 
started to write what was to become lm_sensors.
I will be the first to admit that lm_sensors is not as user-friendly as
it could be. There is hard work going on at making an automatic detection
script to determine what kind of sensors chips and SMBus adapters are
present on your system, as we now support at least 3 different adapters
(not counting parallel port I2C adapters), and 10 different chip types.
In the meantime, we are always willing to help people through our
internal mailing list (lm78@stimpy.netroedge.com). 
If you are willing to give it another try, drop us a note describing your
problems, and we will try to help you out. If not, and you have 'simple'
hardware (meaning a LM78 on the ISA bus), there are several alternative
implementations; 
http://www.netroedge.com/~lm78,
 our homepage, should list
them.
By the way, most people seem to be able to use lm_sensors without any
problem at all. It is not as impossible as this mail may seem to imply.
You *do* have to read the included documentation before you start, though!
Good luck,
  Frodo
