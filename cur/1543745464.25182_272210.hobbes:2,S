I got quite a few reports regarding WOL and via-rhine. Here's some
information so people can find it:
Rhine hardware can often do WOL without any support from the operating
system, i.e. the hardware will wake-up upon receiving a magic packet
even if you have no OS installed. That's meant for legacy OSes like DOS.
A WOL-aware OS has a more fine-grained control over Rhine WOL. For one,
it can turn WOL off. It can also configure the type of events that will
wake the system.
The via-rhine code has changed in the 2.6.9/2.6.10 time frame: Legacy
WOL is turned off (mostly), so it will not work unless you explicitly
tell the driver to enable WOL. You can do this using ethtool(8).
If WOL used to work with your Rhine hardware and now all of a sudden
doesn't, check first if you enabled WOL using ethtool.
