OK, I see. It's just that I stumbled across the patch for DMA audio CD
reading and thought that you perhaps have something similiar for
writing bigger block sizes.

I have to admit that I do not even have an idea what you are talking
about. I just think that this is a major drawback for Linux. CD writers
are as fast as 48x nowadays and DVD writers start getting more popular,
too, just as doing c2scans. So it is quite disappointing that it doesn't
work flawlessly with Linux.
