that is not correct.
I suspect what is meant is the "attack" on older openssl versions where
you could in theory get SOME information about a key in use by snooping
cache patterns in a shared cache situation. By no means is it a "direct"
leak of any kind, and openssl has since then been fixed to not have as
many key-dependent execution streams anymore.
I would suggest you drop the patch; openssl has been long fixed, and it
was only a theoretical attack in the first place...
I'm not saying the attack isn't something that should be addressed.. but
it is, and disabling hyperthreading is not the right fix.
