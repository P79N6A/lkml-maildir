Right, I've CC'ed him, and will forward the original patch in a moment.
It'd be perfectly possible to lock two extents in there, just seems like
over-engineering, and yet more strange mm-dependent code down in the arch
than I'd like to put there.
If Nicolas insists on avoiding the copies, then the simplest answer is
to disable split ptlock in the CONFIG_IWMMXT case too, and replace my
signal.c mods by just a comment highlighting the issue.
ARM is not the architecture (ia64) which prompted this page fault
scalability business.  I've no idea of its benefit or otherwise on ARM.
Just didn't want ARM to be the only one not invited to the party.

That hadn't crossed my mind, good catch.  (Though bad both before and
after my change.)  I did wonder about the alignment, the assumption that
*(unsigned long *)addr all fits within the same page - but assumed ARM's
instructions are suitably aligned?
It does look like that cmpxchg emulation needs to be done another way,
quite unrelated to my changes.

Unquestionably.

Yes, patch 7/9 disables it on ARM unless CPU_CACHE_VIPT
(since in other cases cache_is_vivt may be determined at runtime).
config SPLIT_PTLOCK_CPUS
	int
	default "4096" if ARM && !CPU_CACHE_VIPT
	default "4096" if PARISC && DEBUG_SPINLOCK && !64BIT
	default "4"
Please let me know when ARM supports 4096 cpus, I'll change that then!
