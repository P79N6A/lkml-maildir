    Could you elaborate on the reason you want to keep the minor space
    compact?
That is not necessarily what I want.
Indeed, I see as one of the possible uses of a large dev_t
a hash of a proper name.
It is just that Badari and I were talking about the numbering scheme
index = next_index++ and he pointed out that the current system
has a certain weak number preservation guarantee that this
index = next_index++ does not have. True.
It is Roman who wanted to keep the number space compact.
It is me who wants compatibility as far as 8+8 device numbers are
concerned, while I can see lots of ways to use new number space.
(You need not worry that I worry about preservation of numbering
after rmmod. I am not interested. But in case anybody is, there
is a numbering solution that achieves that, too.)
The whole conversation came because there is an array in sd.c
that must go, or must be limited to the size needed for compatibility.
