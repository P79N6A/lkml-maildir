  Hi, all. I've just tried measuring Linux NFS client performance on a
dual PPro running 2.3.4. Block size is 8 kiB, network is 100 Mb/s
switched full duplex. The server is running Solaris 2.5.1 on a quad
UltraSparc (250 MHz).
Read bandwidth is  4.1 MB/s
Write bandwidth is 0.2 MB/s
Why is NFS write performance so bad? I apologise for not having paid
closer attention to this, if this is a well-worn topic.
				Regards,
					Richard....
