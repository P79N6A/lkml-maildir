	The terms 'contract' and 'license' are interchangeable. The GPL is a
contract that gives you a right to use certain copryighted works in a way
you wouldn't otherwise have in exchange for certain compensation. The terms
of the license act like a contract and can even grant rights not recognized
under copyright law itself. See, for example, Bowers v. Baystate and ProCD
Inc v. Zeidenberg.
	Note that things may be very different outside the U.S.
