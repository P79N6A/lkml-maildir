Subject: possible problem with moxa intellio driver in 2.4.x kernels
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

I have MOXA C218Turbo PCI card, in the moment i have 4 leased lines connected
to it (all of them 115200). Form time to time (2 times a day, sometimes 1
time/2 days - seems random), one or more ports looks like there're dead...
Pppd is loaded, interface is up, but there's no activity on port (i look at
activity with "mxmon" supplied with moxa).
When interface is up and runnig i've got:
Baud Rate - 115200
CTS - ON
DSR - ON
DCD - ON
when it's up, but dead, i've got:
Baud Rate - 9600
CTS - OFF
DSR - OFF
DCD - ON
Currently i'm using 2.4.3 kernel, but have used 2.4.2-ac11 and -ac26
System is Slackware 7.2 (pre), glibc 2.2.1, pppd 2.4.1 (with 2.4.0 the problem
was the same)
What more informations should i supply to find cure? :)
PS. When port hangs, I can run moxaload one more time, restart pppd, and
connections are wroking for another day or X hours...
