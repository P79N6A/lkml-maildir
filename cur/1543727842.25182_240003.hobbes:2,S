Without keyboard:
drivers/input/serio/i8042.c: 60 -> i8042 (command) [357624] 
drivers/input/serio/i8042.c: 9a -> i8042 (parameter) [357624]
With keyboard:
drivers/input/serio/i8042.c: ff -> i8042 (kbd-data) [33392] 
drivers/input/serio/i8042.c: fa <- i8042 (interrupt, kbd, 1) [33464] 
drivers/input/serio/i8042.c: aa <- i8042 (interrupt, kbd, 1) [33841] 
drivers/input/serio/i8042.c: 60 -> i8042 (command) [33976] 
drivers/input/serio/i8042.c: 65 -> i8042 (parameter) [33976]
The shutdown sequence is not hanging, though, as far as I can tell.  You 
can triple fault the machine immediately after the first WCTR command 
during initialization (triple fault reboots it just fine just before the 
same command) and it doesn't cause a reboot, and yet it's no longer 
executing instructions from the kernel (or at least not printk's or 
anything meaningful).  I don't think it's the parameters that it's 
passing to the WCTR command either, because if you look in the previous 
batch of printk's, it's putting back in exactly what it got out.
