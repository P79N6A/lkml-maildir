I'm seeing this error too, and also frequent crashes (total lock ups) of the
machine (every day or two at the moment). Could the two be related?
I haven't got round to doing any diagnostics yet, but there's nothing
obvious in the logs. I was going to dismantle the machine and check
connections etc. first.
