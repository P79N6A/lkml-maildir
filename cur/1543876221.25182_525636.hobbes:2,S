I tested your patch and it seems to work well.
Test environment
================
 - kernel: 2.6.21-rc5 with or without Ingo's patch
 - others: same as my initial mail except for omitting nice 19 cases
Result (without Ingo's patch)

Although it is not perfectly fair, it is certain that this patch really improve
