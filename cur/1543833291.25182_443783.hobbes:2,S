I'm not sure it matters.
If you want to do the job right then do this
- Stick an indicator of how much else wants to run on this CPU in the
vsyscall page or similar location
In your locks you can now do
              while(try_and_grab_lock() == FAILED) {
                       if (kernelpage->waiting > 0)
                              sys_somelockwaitthing()
              }
Furthermore the kernel can be intelligent about the waiting indicator
for power or other global scheduling reasons
