Every time when I use ioclt commands on my driver I get a "kernel stack corruption. Aiee".
I set a breakpoint in exit.c at line 142 (using gdbstub and debugging with ddd) and 
printed the graphic of the task task_struct *p in a file which is attached to this mail.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
 139                         REMOVE_LINKS(p);
 140                         release_thread(p);
 141                         if (STACK_MAGIC != *(unsigned long *)p->kernel_stack_page)
 142                                 printk(KERN_ALERT "release: %s kernel stack corruption. Aiee\n"
, p->comm);
 143                         free_kernel_stack(p->kernel_stack_page);
 144                         current->cmin_flt += p->min_flt + p->cmin_flt;
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Who can tell me why my  p->kernel_stack_page isn't STACK_MAGIC?
in linux/kernel.h
#define STACK_MAGIC     0xdeadbeef
*(unsigned long *)p->kernel_stack_page = 0x2b;
By calling the ioctl the driver allocates thought vmalloc 111600 bytes of kernel space
which is used until a new ioctl call.
Is this the reason for the stack corruption?
Has any memory who is allocated thought ioctl calls to be freed before returning the call?
Hope you can help me
Vasili
