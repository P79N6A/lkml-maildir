When you run a linux box as an LVS (Linux Virtual Server) director, what 
is the recomended way of getting performance statistics out of the kernel?
I'd like to run some tests on the LVS subsystem in order to work out its 
scaling limits on various hardware configurations, but I can't work out 
how to determine the kernels' load in response to the number of 
connection requests I put through it.
Cheers,
Mark.
