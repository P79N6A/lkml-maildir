Why isn't 28 heads a reasonable geometry.  It's only 14 (or 15) platters. 
Given the size of modern heads and actuator assemblies, it's not too hard
to get there.  I suspect that the 328 sectors / track is an average.  The
spec sheet didn't have any information about the number of zones.  But
that wasn't the point I was trying to make.
