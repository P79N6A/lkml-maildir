	I have the same situation but with 2.2.0-pre7 on my Inet server.
Not havy loaded server for mail/news/ftp/http/etc. Usual load does not
exceed 0.1, but after ~15-30 hours the load start growing and machine
became fully unusable in several minutes. I have top running and can't
see anythimg unusual except growing load. With previous kernel 2.1.131
last uptime was 57 days without any problems.
Here my ver_linux output:
