So... can we call the new kernel threads [kbandaidd]?

It's fairly simple.  The slightly tricky bit will be ensuring that
keventd will reliably swallow the work item which we just fed it,
before anything else.  But I guess the spinlock will be sufficient there.
But I don't think we should do any of this.

Do we?  work_on_cpu() is some last-gasp oh-i-screwed-my-code-up thing. 
We _really_ want people to use on_each_cpu()!
We should bust a gut to keep the number of callers to the
resource-intensive (deadlocky!) work_on_cpu() to a minimum.
(And to think that adding add_timer_on() creeped me out).
hm.  None of that was very helpful.  How to move forward?
I think I disagree that work_on_cpu() should be made into some robust,
smiled-upon core kernel facility.  It _is_ slow, it _is_ deadlockable. 
It should be positioned as something which is only used as a last
resort.  And if you _have_ to use it, sort out your locking!
Plus the number of code sites which want to fiddle with other CPUs in
this manner will always be small.  cpufreq, MCE, irq-affinity, things
like that.
What is the deadlock in acpi-cpufreq?  Which lock, and who is the
"other" holder of that lock?
