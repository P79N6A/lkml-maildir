Subject: [PATCH] Fix EISA/VLB/PCI network controllers alignment in menuconfig
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi Deepak, Russell, Jeff,
The CS89x0 Kconfig entry currently breaks the alignment of all
"EISA, VLB, PCI and on board controllers" that follow it in menuconfig.
This patch fixes it.
This bug was introduced in version 2.6.13-rc1. A first, different fix
attempt was made by Deepak Saxena:
http://www.kernel.org/git/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=712cb1ebb1653538527500165d8382ca48a7fca1
But it seems it was then overwritten by a subsequent (unsigned?) changeset
from Russell King:
http://www.kernel.org/git/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=e399822da0f99f8486c33c47e7ae0d32151461e5
Whatever, Deepak's fix wasn't actually fixing the problem for me.
I'm not sure my fix is correct (what exactly are the dependencies
we want for this driver?) but at least it fixes the alignment problem.
It would be nice if we could have this fix in 2.6.15, although it
admittedly isn't critical.
This patch also fixes the module name in the help text, which was
incorrect.
