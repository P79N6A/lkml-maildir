Thanks for the acpidump and the testing.
                    If (\_OSI ("Windows 2006"))
                    {
                        Store (0x40, ^OSTB)
                        Store (0x40, ^TPOS)
                    }
                    If (\_OSI ("Linux"))
                    {
                        Store (0x01, LINX)
                        Store (0x80, ^OSTB)
                        Store (0x80, ^TPOS)
                    }
// LINX is a NOP
// OSTB is compard only to >= 4, so setting it to x80 has no effect
// OSTP() return value is never checked
However, TPOS is compared to 0x40 in several places, so
OSI(Linux) will cause changes there.
In particular OSI(Linux) will turn off some AML code
associated with ATA -- _STM and _PS0 code.
That may be the reason you see resume issues with acpi_osi=Linux.
(or frankly, it may be some other random problem)
But in any case, we've blacklisted all of Acer going forward.
thanks,
