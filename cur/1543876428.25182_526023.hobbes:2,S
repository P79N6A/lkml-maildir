Ah, good point, but I think it fits.

Well, we've had problems in the past where people turn on options  
under CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL or CONFIG_EMBEDDED and it breaks in exactly  
the specified fashion and they complain on LKML.  The point of this  
is to expose kconfig tunables which a "normal" kconfig user would get  
wrong 99% of the time and would break in obscure ways.  For example,  
the "CONFIG_MULTITHREAD_PCI_PROBE" option, if it was re-added for  
more tinkering, could go under this option.

Ah, see, due to the magic of kconfig language this does not show up  
as a separate option (no text for the "bool") identifier.  It's just  
an alias for I_KNOW_WHAT_THE_HELL_I_AM_DOING to make it easier to use  
in other Kconfig files ("depends EXPERT && SOME_OPTION!=n &&  
ANOTHER_OPTION") instead of s/EXPERT/I_KNOW_WHAT_THE_HELL_I_AM_DOING/g.
