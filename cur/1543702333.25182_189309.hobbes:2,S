Subject: Re: [PATCH] Re: loop device changes the block size and causes misaligned accesses to the real device, which can't be processed

Ok, Ben's patch will make the loop device work as any other device, and 
then ext2 will complain that the hard blocksize is bigger than the 
blocksize used for ext2 (in my example of 1k for ext2) and fail to mount 
it.
This is better than getting misaligned transfers et all, and is 
consistent with using the real device.
On the other hand, it is much more useful being able to actually mount 
the ext2 fs, and I managed to do that with the loop-aes patch (Thanks 
Jari Ruusu)
I confirm this bug closed. Thanks to all
