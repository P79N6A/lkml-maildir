No problem.  Some lists do use the subject line.  I find it
rather annoying, as do many people, but they are the minority of
mailing lists, at least the ones I subscribe to anyway.  I've
found that if the mailing list maintainer is contacted, and
discussed with nicely, they often add the "X-mailing-list"
header, and remove the "[whatever]" from the subject line.  The
odd person complains about it, but once everyone is made aware of
the new header, and how to use it, and the reasoning, very few
people complain or are bothered.
Take care,
