Hello Arjan,
Thanks for this suggestion.
But I looked at Systemtap before, and as I remember, it is very
flexible, but it only traces function calls. (or am I missing
something?)
I also need this scheduler-tracer, besides for fully fledged X86
systems, also for ARM based boards also with a very minimal userland,
and limited flash. So, it has to be lightweight also. I can only use
cross-compilers to build the tools... (something Systemtap is not good
at as I remember...)
So, I am missing something here, or it is unfortunately not what I am
looking for...
Kind Regards,
Remy
