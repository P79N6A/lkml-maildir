HI,
I was trying kernel 2.5 with TCQ enabled.
I tried it on three Desktar disk (manufactured in Thailand
in february 2001) model dtla 305020.
All three disk died after some week, without
any signal of being dying.
I was starting to suspect about an HW problem.
With 2.4 kernels, no tcq, they could work
without any problem for almost 8 months, but now,
I moved those disk to test systems to test tcq support
and all died badly. This is not an heat problem, since
thay staty in a CED conditioned at 18C.
Has anyone had a similar experience with this kind of disks?
Luigi
