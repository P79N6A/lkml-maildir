Hmm, what about this:

Do you mean the one Scsi_Host per LU?  If it is that, then it was just
taken over from drivers/ieee1394/sbp2.c.  Sbp2 is doing this still today
mostly for historical reasons; I just didn't find the time yet to try to
get to a leaner scheme.
Or do you mean something else?

Yes.

No.  The discovery of LUs of SBP-2 targets happens on the IEEE 1212
level of things.  The initiator has to parse the configuration ROM of
the target FireWire node; the ROM has entries for each LU.  (After that,
SBP-2 login protocol commences for each LU, and only after that can SCSI
requests be issued.  There is nothing SCSIish going on before that.)
What's missing as a /* FIXME */ here is actually implemented in the
mainline sbp2.c and needs to be brought over here; converted to the new
FireWire core APIs.

The NULL probably has to do with the ability to call remove_scsi_devices
in different paths.  (These paths are not concurrent.)
