that's not what I said. What I said is that kernel patches are not an 
acceptable temporary workaround for the large installed base of average 
customers, since they generally cannot or do not want to bother 
recompiling stuff. We still make source for linux code and other parts 
required to allow the technically inclined to easily rebuild the 
modules and comply with the GPL.

  The proprietary code that cannot be released in source form is 
licensed material that was essentially developed by another party 
(Conexant) for other platforms. It clearly does not constitute a 
derived work of Linux.
