Ah, the memories... (apologies for the interruptions, but just had too ...)
RK05 cartriges looked very similar to a floppy case the size of an old 78 RPM
record (about 12 inches across, 2 - 3 inches high). I never used them, but
I did see them. They were among the first disk drives DEC ever made. Not the
first (I think that was a DF-32 for PDP 8 systems with 32 K bytes of disk
space). The raw storage was reported as 2.5 MB, formatted was ~2.4MB, with
two recording surfaces. The drive looked very similar to a modern CD drive
that would fit in about a 3U (ummm 4U?) 19 inch rack. It had 2 recording
surfaces. It did have a write enable/disable switch. If I remember right
these were originally made for the PDP 11/10-20 systems used for laboratory
device control - chromatographs were mentioned by the chemistry department
back in school.
I may have an old DEC peripheral specification book at home (11/45 version).
I really liked those books that DEC used to put out. If you ever needed to
program a DEC interface, that book had everything. It was almost like the
engineers were bragging about how easy the interfaces were to program.

I think they were CDC transports.

Or the 11/34 version of the Lunar Lander (load from paper tape, graphics
display on VT11 - 512x512 8 bit color). It used to be distributed as a
diagnostic tool (hardware level interrupts, dual A/D conversion via joystick,
I/O via VT11). Any memory, DMA, or bus configuration errors would hang
the system with a known diagnostic one-liner message explaining the problem.
I also saw a report of a "terminal warfare" event where the graphics display
was being used for text editing when two little stick figure men would walk
onto the display, pick up a line, and then walk off the screen. There was
nothing the user could do until it finished. The text buffer wasn't touched,
only the display buffer.
