I'd like to respect your requiremnt. but I also would like to know
why you like deterministic hierarchy oom than notification.
I think one of problem is, current patch description is a bit poor
and don't describe from administrator view.
Could you please sort the discssion out and explain your requirement detail?
otherwise (I guess) this discussion don't reach people agreement.
I don't like the implementation idea vs another idea discussion.
it often don't make productive discussion.
I'd like to sort out people requrement.
otherwise I can't review the patch fill requirement or not.
