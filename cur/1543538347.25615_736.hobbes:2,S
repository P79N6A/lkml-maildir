It is now available as
	
ftp://ftp.uk.linux.org/pub/linux/sct/fs/jfs/ext3-0.0.2f.tar.gz
Incremental diffs from 0.0.2d and 0.0.2e are also there.
Cheers, 
 Stephen
--------------------------------------
Changes in this release
-----------------------
in 0.0.2f:
Fix two bugs introduced in 0.0.2e:
 directory corruption bug on extending directory files
 fix possible OOPS on illegal directory operations
Include "rmdir" operations in the orphan-handling code
in 0.0.2e:
Port forward to current (2.2.17pre9, and Red Hat errata 2.2.16-3)
kernels
Merge in a number of ext2 fixes from 2.2.15+:
 * NFS versioning 
 * Set directory type information correctly on sockets
Fix a number of buffer leaks in recovery (prevents set_blocksize errors
on mounting filesystems)
sync(2) waits for current transactions correctly
Set the superblock s_dirt flag on all transaction completions
Fixed the order of asserts and buffer writes in fs/buffer.c: this was
causing false assertion failures on Mylex raid controllers
Delete the filesystem commit timer on unmount in all cases
Include Andreas Dilger's implementation of the "orphan list" code:
  The orphan list maintains an on-disk list of inodes needing cleaned up
  on recovery, including:
  * Deletion of unlinked, but still opened, files after a reboot;
  * Completion after recovery of truncates which were in progress but 
    which had to be split across a transaction boundary
