Hello All,
Please ignore all mails from me, sent out today. I tried switching my
mailer to KMail from mutt and KMail has decided to mail out all
the stuff in my outbox which were sent earlier through mutt. I
will stay away from KMail :-(
Iam extermely sorry for any inconvenience this may have caused.
