After trying many h/w and s/w configurations, I've apparently isolated 
my instability issues to using the following the linux kernel highmem 
options: CONFIG_HIGHMEM4G=y, CONFIG_HIGHMEM=y, CONFIG_HIGHMEMIO=y.  I 
have 1GB ram, so maybe one of my dimms is bad or maybe there's a highmem 
bug in the 2.4.X kernel.
The crashes in my previous emails today were due to using the latest 
alsa modules (loaded, but not used by any application) with a HIGHMEM 
enabled kernel.  I appear to have no problem using alsa when HIGHMEM is 
disabled.  Apparently, I'm not the only one having problems with alsa 
and highmem 
(

).
I would be willing to work with a kernel developer to better isolate 
this problem and test a patch.
Thank you,
Peter Santoro
