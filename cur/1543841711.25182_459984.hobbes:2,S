Subject: No RAID/LVM config in 2.6.18-rc5-mm1

I'm trying to build 2.6.18-rc5-mm1 from scratch, but I can't find the 
config options for multi-device (RAID and LVM).  If I go ahead and build 
a kernel without those options, it fails to boot, complaining that 
dm-snapshot and others are missing.
Here is the sequence of events:
1.  Untar linux-2.6.17.tar.gz
	make menuconfig -- Yep, multi-device options are there.
2.  Apply patch-2.6.18-rc5
	make menuconfig -- Yep, again, multi-device options are there.
3.  Apply patch 2.6.18-rc5-mm1
	make menuconfig -- multi-device options are gone.
What am I doing wrong?
Thanks,
Jay
