More accurately according to the GPL v2 theory Linus advanced the laptop
you paid is a shared property of the laptop manufacturer (who can
install whatever he likes without your input thanks to DRM) and the
kernel developper (who gets the source code).
You as end-user are only there to give this technical elite the money
they need to continue their activities (I'm forcing the point? Find me
one anti-GPL-v3 message in this thread that acknowledged the buyer/user
had any right)
This thanks to DRM which was not provided for when GPL v2 was written
and has been retroactively declared kosher.
