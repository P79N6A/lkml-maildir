Becaues the compiler optimization removes the following code without it.
	regs->eflags = (regs->eflags & 0xffffcfff) | (level << 12);
The compiler provides access to the argument 'unused' in the stack
(asmlinkage, 
i.e. __attribute__ ((regparm(0))), but it thinks modifying the stack 
more than that is not effective anyway. So it elimites the code under
optimizations.

No, it's not removing fields from there. The original definition of IGNLABLE
is 
	#define IGNLABEL 0&(int)
And
	IGNLABEL "HmacRxUc",
simpile ends up 0, (in gcc). But this is just causing (a lot of) warnings,
so I take this out.
