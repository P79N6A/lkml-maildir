the trace is fine, note the extra 0x08000000:

it was zero before - indeed hard to notice optically :-|
found the reason for this latency meanwhile: it's kernel_fpu_begin() and
kernel_fpu_end() disabling/enabling preemption. (these are used by the
mmx memcpy's)
i've uploaded the -11 patch with a preliminary fix:
    
http://redhat.com/~mingo/realtime-preempt/
which turns off the FPU-based ops if PREEMPT_RT is specified. The speed
difference should be small but the latency difference is large ...
could you try -11, do you still see these large latencies?
