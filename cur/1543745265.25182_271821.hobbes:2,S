It was removed at 2003.06.05, by "[fs] Remove kobject support for
filesystems" change-set (mochel@osdl.org), you can extract patch from
bitkeeper.
Reiser4 adds /sys/fs and /sys/fs/reiser4 manually (see kattr.[ch] in its
sources), and uses
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.9-rc4/2.6.9-rc4-mm1/broken-out/reiser4-kobject-umount-race.patch
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.9-rc4/2.6.9-rc4-mm1/broken-out/reiser4-kobject-umount-race-cleanup.patch
to avoid _some_ races (with umount), but these patches provide no
protection against races with module unloading.
