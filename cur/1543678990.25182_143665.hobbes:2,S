The thought of building/passing "connection" information around in the 
scheduler gives me a bad case of the willies.  I can imagine a process 
struct containing a list of components and their cpu usage information as a 
means to defeat fairness/starvation issues, but I can't imagine how to do 
that and retain high speed low drag O(1) scheduling.
Until someone demonstrates that the DoS/abuse scenarios I might be 
imagining are real, in C, I think I'll do the smart thing: try to stop 
worrying about it and stick to very very simple stuff.

doesn't cut it, and there's a "you have to be this tall" line at the 
entrance to the wizards section of the hat store;)
