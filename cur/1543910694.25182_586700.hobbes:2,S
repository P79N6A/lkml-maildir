Yes, I'm in favour of converting sched_clock to use virtual time. It
makes sense to me.

Hmm, ok. But the fact is that right now the accounting via
sum_exec_runtime is broken in regard to virtual cpus, isn't it?

Yes, we want utime and stime represent the time spent on the physical
cpu. To make up for the missing time the steal time field has been
introduced.

No, imho it is less consistent if the virtual box shows virtual time. If
you look at the top output as a user and it shows that some process used
x% of cpu what does it tell you? With virtual cpus next to nothing, you
have to normalize the numbers with the %steal while the process was
running. But even then it still is not a good number because the %steal
changes while a process is running. The only good solution is to use
virtual time for all cputime values.
