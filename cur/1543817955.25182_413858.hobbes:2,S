The patch (applied to 2.6.17-rc1) does fix the oops, but sound is still
garbled with twinkle using /dev/dsp. 
About this garbled sound: I call an echo service on my asterisk server,
which just echoes back everything I say. Works well using /dev/dsp with
2.6.16, but with 2.6.17-rc1, even with the patch applied, I hear no echo
at all for ~1s. After that, I hear a strongly distorted echo.
If I change the twinkle settings to use the ALSA native devices instead
of /dev/dsp, everything is fine.
Pure playback, eg. with xmms, is fine with 2.6.17-rc1 using /dev/dsp.
