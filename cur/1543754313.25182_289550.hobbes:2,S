link_path_walk() still has a reference to gr_inode_follow_link (the code
you probably want to move to an LSM exit), and sys_ling() still calls
gr_inode_hardlink() and gr_inode_handle_create() - but the actual functions
you're calling either don't exist anymore, or they didn't get compiled and linked
in.  If those functions are supposed to exist, you need to get them into a .o.
If those are (as I suspect) becoming LSM exit hooks, then you need to clean up
the direct calls in link_path_walk() and sys_link().
