If we declare an IP address to be published ie. arp -v -i eth0 -Ds 
172.25.207.1 eth0 pub
And if we do the ping 172.25.207.1 the tcpdump showing that arp request 
arrives but the box happily ignores it.
There is not publishing occurs, though arp cache has:
/ # arp
Address                 HWtype  HWaddress           Flags 
Mask            Iface
tuna                    ether   00:04:75:E7:1B:93   
C                     eth0
172.25.140.1            ether   08:00:20:7D:4D:9A

172.25.207.1     0x1         0xc         00:00:00:00:00:00     *        eth0
Could anybody please tell me is this the problem with the kernel we are 
using - 2.4.22 or something else.
Thank you
