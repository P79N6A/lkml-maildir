What do you mean? That my patch doesn't fix all problems that might
exist but are not yet fixed or that my patch introduces new problems?
Well, for example in the resource reservation code [e820.c,
e820_reserve_resource()] that is handled at line 1285:
		if (end != (resource_size_t)end) {
			res++;
			continue;
		}
My patch only changes the firmware interface, not the architecture
specific code. However, I cannot guarantee that it doesn't break
something, but what action do you expect from me that the patch is
taken?

Bernhard
