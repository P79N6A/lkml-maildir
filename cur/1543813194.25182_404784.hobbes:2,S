Please open a bugzilla here
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=ACPI
Attach the output from acpidump, available in pmtools here:
http://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/lenb/acpi/utils/
paste the contents of /proc/cpuinfo attach the dmesg.
Please verify if speedstep_centrino loads, and if you see
different behaviour with that over acpi-cpufreq.
Also, please show what governor is being used,
and if setting it to constant, say with "performance"
makes the problem go away.
thanks,
-Len
