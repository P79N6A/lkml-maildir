The patch looks very good. A few issues come to mind:
- What's the status of the other fixed fields in the large inodes? Is
  there agreement on adding exactly the fields in the patch?
- A common operation is to change an attribute's value without changing
  the value's length. The current code does not optimize this case, but
  it should. The patch makes this optimization a little harder.
- struct ext3_xattr_entry makes little sense in an inode. The
  e_value_block and e_hash fields should go away. The e_value_size
  field could be shrunk from 4 to 2 bytes. This would save 10 bytes per
  attribute. The code wouldn't become a lot more messy from that.
- In-inode EA support should be configurable. I would like to choose
  whether I want this feature at compile time, with as few #ifdef's as
  possible.

The current implementation is not suitable for applications which store
unique EAs for very many inodes. Storing the EAs in the inodes is much
better, but increasing the inode size also costs space.

Nice. That's probably with unique attributes per inode.

I don't know which strategy will be best here. We don't have to solve this
problem now, though.
By the way, you will likely also need dynamically allocated inodes, right?
What's the status here?
Cheers,
Andreas.
