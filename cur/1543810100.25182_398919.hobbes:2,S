Hi Adrian,

From your numbers this sounds true ... but actually you might want the
modules to delay the init of the various hardware bits...
Sometime boot-time is king and you just try and get back as much of
the size costs as it takes...
I think for EMBEDDED and MODULES is actually a very common case ... if
somewhat odd.
