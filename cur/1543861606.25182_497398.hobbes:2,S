Subject: [PATCH] Driver core: fix refcounting bug
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This patch (as832) fixes a newly-introduced bug in the driver core.
When a kobject is assigned to a kset, it must acquire a reference to
the kset.
Signed-off-by: Alan Stern <stern@rowland.harvard.edu>

The bug was introduced in Kay's "unify /sys/class and /sys/bus at 
/sys/subsystem" patch.
I left the assignment of class_dev->kobj.parent as it was, although it is 
not needed.  The following call to kobject_add() will end up doing the 
same thing.

P.S.: Tracking down refcounting bugs is a real pain!  I spent an entire 
afternoon on this one...  :-(
