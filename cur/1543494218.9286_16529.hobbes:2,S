Remember, this is TLB flushes, not cache flushes, we're talking about.
*Every* memory access after a TLB flush needs to reload the TLB, even if
it is just a read from already-cached memory.  Even just spinning in
kernel space may require TLB refills after a flush (although newer
Pentia do let you mark certain page tables as global, so a mm replace
won't evict those TLBs).
