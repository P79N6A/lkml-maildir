The much maligned history mechanism in mainline didn't start it's life
as an interactivity estimator, that's a name it acquired later.  What it
was first put there for was to ensure fairness for sleeping tasks.
I found it most ironic that the numbers I posted showed that mechanism
working perfectly, with an exploit that was designed specifically to
expose it's weakness, despite the deliberate tweaks that have gone in
tweaking it very heavily in the unfair direction, and this went
uncommented.  If I had run more of them, it would have shown that
weakness very well.  We all know that weakness exists.
What the numbers clearly showed was that sleeping tasks did not get the
fairness RSDL advertised with the particular test I ran, yet it went
uncommented/uncontested.  Anyone could have tested with the trivial
proggy of their choice... but nobody did.
The history mechanism is not only about interactivity, and never was.

I'm gonna go piddle around with code now, much more fun than yacking :)
