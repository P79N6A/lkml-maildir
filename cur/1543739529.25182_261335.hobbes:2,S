it seems to fix it. i don't see any more messages like the reported anymore.
snd-cs46xx might have some other issues though: Upon rmmod snd-cs46xx i see:
Oct 17 19:43:04 mango kernel: Sound Fusion CS46xx 0000:00:0f.0: Device was removed without properly calling pci_disable_device(). This may need fixing.
but i should probably report that to alsa-devel instead right?
