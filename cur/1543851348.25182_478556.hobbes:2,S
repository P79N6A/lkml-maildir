Thanks.
Some of them are still different than the old code now, but that's probably
ok.
But the irq race you pointed out is still there (unless you fixed it in a differnet patch) 
I don't know if it makes
a difference, but here is a patch to fix it.

Fix race in IO-APIC routing entry setup.
Interrupt could happen between setting the IO-APIC entry
and setting its interrupt data.
Pointed out by Linus.
