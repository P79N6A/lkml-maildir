OK, I see now.  Simple enough, better than the original.  Go for it.
There was a PXA issue I was alluding to that's still open, though.
It's the way there's no selectivity about what platform devices are
registered ... even kernels running on boards where OHCI isn't hooked
up to anything will be registering an OHCI controller, as one of many
examples.  Won't affect this particular case, but in general that'd
be nice to see fixed.
