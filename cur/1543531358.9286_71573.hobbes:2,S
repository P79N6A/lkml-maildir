Tim Waugh said that changing "name" in "struct net_device" from "char*"
to "char[]" would mean changing a large number of net drivers, as they
currently assign directly to dev->name.
I looked into drivers/net to see how big this problem was.  A quick grep
for "dev->name *=" revealed the following files:
    3c503 3c505 3c515 3c523 ac3200 depca dgrs e2100 eexpress es3210 eth16i
    ewrk3 hp-plus hp lance lne390 ne ne2 ne3210 net_init ppp_generic rcpci45
    smc-mca smc-ultra smc-ultra32 wavelan wd
This is where my figure of 27 comes from.
