Far less complicated than NFSv4.1 though (which is easy :))

I'm not worried; I'm stating facts as they exist today (draft 13):
NFS v4.1 does something completely without precedent in the history of 
NFS:  the specification is defined such that interoperability is 
-impossible- to guarantee.
pNFS permits private and unspecified layout types.  This means it is 
impossible to guarantee that one NFSv4.1 implementation will be able to 
talk another NFSv4.1 implementation.
Even if Linux supports the entire NFSv4.1 RFC (as it stands in draft 13 
anyway), there is no guarantee at all that Linux will be able to store 
and retrieve data, since it's entirely possible that a proprietary 
protocol is required to access your data.
NFSv4.1 is no longer a completely open architecture.
