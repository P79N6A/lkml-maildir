From: Thomas Horsley <tom.horsley@ccur.com>
I spent a long time the other day trying to examine an initrd
image on a fedora core 5 system because the initrd.txt file
is apparently obsolete. Here is a patch which I hope
will reduce future confusion for others.

I'm resubmitting this according to the SubmittingPatches
guidelines. This was made from the 2.6.17.7 tree, but
I don't think initrd.txt has changed much in any of the
trees. I know I'm not supposed to send an attachment, but
I see evolution has already screwed up my cut and paste
attempt and who knows what will happen by the time it
goes through exchange, so I'm adding the patch as an
attachment as well.

+Compressed cpio images
+----------------------
+
+Recent kernels have support for populating a ramdisk from a compressed
cpio
+archive, on such systems, the creation of a ramdisk image doesn't need
to
+involve special block devices or loopbacks, you merely create a
directory on
+disk with the desired initrd content, cd to that directory, and run (as
an
+example):
+
+find . | cpio --quiet -c -o | gzip -9 -n > /boot/imagefile.img
+
+Examining the contents of an existing image file is just as simple:
+
+mkdir /tmp/imagefile
+cd /tmp/imagefile
+gzip -cd /boot/imagefile.img | cpio -imd --quiet
