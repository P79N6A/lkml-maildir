It seems that perhaps that 50% makes more sense on a single/dual CPU 
system than on a more robust one, such as a four way dual core Xeon with 
HT or some such. With hotplug CPUs, and setups on various machines, 
perhaps some resource limit independent of the available resource would 
be useful.
Just throwing out the idea, in case it lands on fertile ground.
