This problem is (mostly) solved already.  You have to use aoss (alsa-lib
based OSS emulation) on top of dmix (software mixing for soundcards too
lame to do it in hardware).  With a recent ALSA dmix is already used by
default so the only change needed is to launch the OSS apps with the
aoss wrapper e.g. aoss ./foo-oss-app.  Since it's not completely
transparent this problem will have to be solved at the distro level, by
making sure all OSS apps are run with this wrapper.
This method should only be needed for closed source apps, an open source
app like artsd should be ported to use the ALSA API.
