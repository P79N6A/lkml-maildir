Someone did a dput() of a freed dentry.  This is quite possibly an nfsd bug.
There's also 
http://bugme.osdl.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1497,
 in which someone
did a scribble on the buffer_head slab's metadata.   Could be unrelated.
There's a debug patch in -mm which should catch the rogue dput().  Perhaps
you could include it in your testing.  It is at
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.0-test9/2.6.0-test9-mm2/broken-out/atomic_dec-debug.patch
