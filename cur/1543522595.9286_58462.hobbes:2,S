ORBS ask you to patch newly discovered holes. If you do not want to patch
them you are free to do so but then you'll be blocked :-)

They disrupt service of peoples who ASKED them to scan you. And ONLY that
peoples. ORBS will not magically insert checks in your sendmail.cf - you should
do it yourself.

Above.net is just extreme [stupidity] case. There are exists lots such cases
(they are listed on orbs.org :-) But in far, far more cases admins will close
holes instead of blocking ORBS since they KNOWS what the end result will be.
