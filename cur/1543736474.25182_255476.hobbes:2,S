Makes some sense, I guess.  However it could lead to
spurious IO errors under high load since some disk
arrays are known to take longer than 10 seconds to
finish an IO operation under extremely heavy loads.
I'm not convinced that enterprise systems need latency
more than reliability, but maybe that's ust me ;)
