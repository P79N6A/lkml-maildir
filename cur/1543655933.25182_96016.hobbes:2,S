I'd gladly accept a patch to add dev_printk() like this right now, if
you want.  But make sure you get the proper spacing to work properly on
older versions of gcc.  Your above macros are incorrect with regards to
that :)

I really feel strongly that these questions need to be answered properly
before we start adding the larger event logging stuff to the main kernel
tree.
Oh yeah, patches to actually _use_ these dev_*() functions would also be
appreciated.  It looks like only one very tiny driver subsystem has
started to use them.  Patches from your group to change this would be
welcome.
thanks,
