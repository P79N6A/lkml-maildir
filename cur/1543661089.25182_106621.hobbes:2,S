First, send a patch, not a chunk of a Makefile.
Second, this is something I defer to Kai, Sam, & Co.
Personally, I am opposed to a use of perl, because it's not
installed in my sparc userland, so I would not be able to
self-compile a leon or joint kernel. But ultimately this is
not my call to decide. At one point, Linus approved Python
into the toolchain. So, present good evidence of need and post
to lists.
