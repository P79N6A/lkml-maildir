I think this argument is mostly deflated by the fact that other 
multimedia-centric operating systems do not ship with controls muted. If 
hardware is detected, all sliders are set to 50%. I think this is superior.
As you pointed out, it probably is best left to distros. I just can't help 
thinking that there might be some scope for improving the default state of 
boolean tunables, even if sliders are left at zero.

Interesting, evidence in your favour. It does not work here. It also did not 
work on the AC'97 in my HP NC6000, which also has External something-or-other 
and which also defaulted to "off".
Took some figuring out. :-)
