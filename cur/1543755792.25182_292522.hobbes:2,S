I added the comments b/c of this email from Jean Delvare, 
http://www.uwsg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0501.3/0977.html.
  The 
relevant part being:
"0x170000 is reserved within the legacy i2c project for an USB algorithm,
and 0x180000 for virtual busses. Could you please use 0x190000 instead,
so as to avoid future collisions?"
It looks like I2C_ALGO_AU1550 was just added so my guess is Jean is 
correct and I2C_ALGO_AU1550 should be made 0x1a0000 (or I move mine back 
one).  Would someone confirm that 0x170000 is used by legacy i2c stuffs? 
I don't really know where to look.  If so, I can easily make a patch 
moving it back.
