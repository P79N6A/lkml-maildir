It's a quite true, sorry for this and thanks for the note. And Peter,
the line I marked
is not to be splitted even having additional spaces over  math operators. Look
orig:
mbr_base = (buf_base+sector_size-1) & ~(sector_size-1);
new (could be):
mbr_base = (buf_base + sector_size - 1) & ~(sector_size - 1);
Is a new version that bad?
Anyway, as only I've something really done, i'll send it to the list
so you/mainteiner could choose which version is to be in kernel ;)
