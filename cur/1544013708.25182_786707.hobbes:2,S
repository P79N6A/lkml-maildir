I have great faith in the ability of PC hardware to continue to be crap for 
the foreseeable future.

Yes and no.  Ext3 is enough of a "default" filesystem for Linux that some 
documentation on when _not_ to use sounds like a good idea.
That said, some kind of a "choosing a filesystem" file would be good, perhaps 
under the filesystems directory.  (Then the ext3 doc would just need a brief 
comment and a pointer to the other file.)
