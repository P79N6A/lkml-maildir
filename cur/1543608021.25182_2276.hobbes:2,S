Oops, ouch.  Thanks for catching the in++ bug; I can't believe that
remained unnoticed for so long.  
Could you send me a pointer to the proposed change to remove poolwords
from the struct?  I'm not sure why that wwould be a good thing at all.
Also, the reason why add_entropy_words did stuff in multiple of 4
bytes was simply because it made the code much more efficient.
Zero-padding isn't a problem, since it's perfectly safe to mix in zero
bytes into the pool.  It is an issue for the entropy credit
calculation, but that's completely separate from add_entropy_words()....
