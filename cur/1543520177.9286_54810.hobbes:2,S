I did just do that (about 3 hours ago). usb-uhci did not go away.
USB still works. Note I did not specify -k on the modprobe command line.
Do you know of any hot pluggable USB HCD's that can be bought right now?
If so which?
The general problem of hot pluggable pcidev's isn't solved right now,
it's not just a question of doing modprobe the right time...
