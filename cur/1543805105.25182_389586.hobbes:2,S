Sure, please test whenever you set it up.

Good point, the sb_lock is not required. I have removed it.

Good point.

From the unmount path, __mntput() is called. It sets s_active to 0 in
deactivate_super(), hence our check would prevent us from pruning a dentry
that is a part of a super block that is going to go away soon. The idea
is to let the unmount do all the work here, the allocator can concentrate
on other dentries.

Yes, we cannot do a down* under a spinlock

How does the modified patch look?
