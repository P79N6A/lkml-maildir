This is what we do all the time, and historically have always done.
But

and
 - gcc still inlines even big functions static that have no markings at 
   all.

That's going to be very painful. Especially since the cases we really want 
to not inline is the random drivers etc - generally not "hot in the 
cache", but they are the ones that cause the most oopses (not per line, 
but globally - because there's just so many drivers).
