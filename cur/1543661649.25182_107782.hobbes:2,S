Hello Ben,
as requested I tried the above "patch" and had no problem so far. Current
situation is:
(ide2, ide3 are PDC, eth2 is tg3)
           CPU0       
  0:    6332048          XT-PIC  timer
  1:      14112          XT-PIC  keyboard
  2:          0          XT-PIC  cascade
  5:          0          XT-PIC  EMU10K1
  7:      14950          XT-PIC  HiSax
  9:   30600647          XT-PIC  ide2, ide3, aic7xxx, aic7xxx, eth0, eth1, eth2
 12:     234451          XT-PIC  PS/2 Mouse
 15:          2          XT-PIC  ide1
NMI:          0 
LOC:          0 
ERR:          0
MIS:          0
I would not say this is a rock-solid test case. I will continue to stress the
setup and keep you informed. Anyway it looks stable up to now.
Regards,
Stephan
