I always thought it is like this (and this is what I still believe after
having read the sprcification):
---
SET_MUTIPLE 16 sectors
---
READ_MULTIPLE 24 sectors
IRQ
PIO transfer 16 sectors
IRQ
PIO transfer 8 sectors
---
Where am I wrong?
By the way, the device *isn't* required to support any lower multiple
count than the maximum one it advertizes. Ugly.
