As the author of this routine, I wish you had included my name in your
CC: list.  :-(
The problem here isn't exactly as you described.  scsi_mod needs to be
pinned (1) because it is the owner of the kobject and hence will be
called when the kobject is released, and (2) because it is the owner
of the callback routine.  However this is just a detail; clearly the
bug needs to be fixed.
One possibility would be to have scsi_mod's exit_scsi() routine call
flush_scheduled_work().  Another would be to add such a call in
sys_delete_module().  Neither of these is attractive.  They would add
overhead when it's not needed, and they would deadlock if a workqueue
routine tried to unload a module.
On balance, the patch below seems better.  Do you agree?
With regard to your analysis of lifetime issues, there is a whole
aspect you did not mention.  A basic assumption of the refcounting
approach is that once X has a reference to Y, X can freely access and
use Y as much as it wants until it drops the reference.
However this is not true when X is a device driver and Y is a device
structure.  Drivers can be unbound from devices.  If X has been
unbound from Y then it must not access Y again, no matter how many
references it possesses.  After all, some other driver may have bound
to Y in the meantime; this other driver would not appreciate the
interference.
Just as bad, if Y represents a hot-pluggable device then some other
device may have been plugged in and may be using Y's old address.  We
don't want X sending commands to a new device, thinking that it is Y!
The complications caused by this requirement affect both the subsystem
code and device drivers.  Drivers must synchronize their release()
methods with every action they take -- and refcounts cannot provide
synchronization.
A similar problem afflicts the char-device subsystem, and here even
less care has been taken to address the issues.  The race between
open() and unregister() is resolved in many places by relying on the
BKL!
We should be able to make things better and easier than they are.
Orphaning open sysfs files was a move in this direction.  But I doubt
they will ever become truly simple and clear.
