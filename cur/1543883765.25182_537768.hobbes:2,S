Before the above change, to select NUMA for em64T systems, you *had* to
select K8_NUMA in the 'Processor type and features'  sub menu to select
CONFIG_NUMA, and then select ACPI NUMA from the generic PM menu, which is
not very intuitive when you have a EM64T NUMA system.
On x86_64 platforms, NUMA topology detection could be K8 style detection,
ACPI based topology  or NUMA emulation.  Most of the real NUMA systems
would need ACPI detection, older AMD platforms would need K8_NUMA, and 
NUMA emulation is a debugging/emulation option to emulate NUMA topology on
a regular SMP box.  Since CONFIG_NUMA + CONFIG_NUMA_EMU is a valid
combination, and since CONFIG_NUMA + CONFIG_K8_NUMA is a valid combination,
it makes sense to have X86_64_ACPI_NUMA on its own, and grouped along with
other NUMA topology styles in the Processor menu.  Hope this is good enough
reason :)
Regarding the subject build breakage, CONFIG_ACPI depends on CONFIG_PM with
an explicit 'depends' keyword. If PM does not get selected and CONFIG_ACPI
gets selected, I would think it is a Kconfig bug which needs fixing no?
Else, we can add a workaround by selecting CONFIG_PM if X86_64_ACPI_NUMA is
chosen.  But AFAICT the right thing is to fix the Kconfig bug.
Thanks,
