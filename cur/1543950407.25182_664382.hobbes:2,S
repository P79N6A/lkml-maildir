while i have no personal use for chroot=, i generally test distros that 
way, yes - and i try to keep them as unmodified as possible.
"Use the initrd as an extended boot commandline" is a poor answer IMO. 
_Everything_ we do on the boot commandline that affects user-space can 
be done in an initrd in theory - but still we have hundreds of boot 
options.
