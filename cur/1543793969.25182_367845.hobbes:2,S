And for reading, I could used a device mapper enforced read only mount or 
filesystem code from grub.
Hmm, how about a possibility to ask the kernel for a list of free pages on a 
swap device? This way, userspace could write the image to swap as the kernel 
currently does, avoiding possible trouble with filesystems.

And all memory allocated and mapped in advance would be part of the image. But 
this is totally acceptable for a "suspend helper".
