This is a bit more informative than "oh it's an ugly hack" ;-)
Ok. I got at least three reasons why I think owner field should be in struct 
socket:
        - struct proto_ops doesn't exists without struct socket.
         It cannot be registered or otherwise used on it's own. 
        - struct sock might inherit (when needed see my explanation about different families)
        its owner from struct socket. In which case sk_set_owner(sk, socket->ops->owner) doesn't
        look right.
        - we might want to protect something else besides socket->ops.
None of those reasons are critical. If you guys still feel that ->owner must be in struct 
proto_ops be that way, I'm ok with it.
Any other comments ? 
Alexey, this is the time for you to speak up ;-). Please please. So far I got zero feedback 
from you. And you are the one who somehow made DaveM radically change his mind :).
Thanks
Max
