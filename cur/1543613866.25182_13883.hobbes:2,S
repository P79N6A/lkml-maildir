As far as I read the source, it seems strace is not counting the
zombie. And strace wait exit() of child2 before restarting the wait()
of parent.
        strace          parent        child1        child2
                                      zombie
                       sleep(1)                    sleep(10)
                     before wait()
      trap wait()
                                                 before exit()
      trap exit()
     restart child2
                                                   run exit()
     restart parent
                      run wait()

Try the above patch. This restart wait() immediately. However, probably
it will break something of other. ;)
