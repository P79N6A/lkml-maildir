Sorry if this is a stupid question.
Is it possible to get user input from within the kernel?
I am trying to develop simple text-based user interface for a user to
perform some security critical actions, i.e. logging in.  Basically, I am
trying to implement a security manager that will be invoked via the magic
key sequence.  For all you security gurus this is a trusted path.
Once the user has invoked my kernel code, I believe I can use printk to
provide output to the user.  However, there is no equivalent scank.  How can
I get user input from the kernel?
Can this be done, or should I use the magic key sequence to launch a user
mode process that will implement the security manager I have in mind?  Also
does it make a difference whether I use kernel 2.2 or 2.4?
Thanks
Jerome
