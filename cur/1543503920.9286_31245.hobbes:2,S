These are parameters that the kernel keeps (among others) for every tty device. 
The kernel itself doesn't use them, but user programs are expected to query 
and use them.

Tty driver.  The kernel knows these values (obviously) automatically for the 
virtual terminals (vga/hgc etc). Xterms know themselves and tell the kernel.
Serial terminal lines usually are 'unknown' (i.e. set to 0) - you could
have attached anything from a power pocket calculator, a commodore C64 to 
a 132x44 terminal to it. For connections via Telnet the client is supposed to
pass the relevant information to the telnet daemon .... what your WIN-client
obviously doesn't. Either it's tooo stupid to know its 80x24 (or 80x25) 
geometry or it's The Microsoft Way(tm) of (not) doing things. People could
start using those tools to communicate to the non-MS-world ......
Maybe you can get a shareware replacement that behaves better.

When they're not right - yes. You otherwise won't see 'top' processes :-))))

Mine does:
STTY(1)                                                   STTY(1)
NAME
       stty - change and print terminal line settings
[.......]
       rows N (np)
              Tell the kernel that the terminal has N rows.
       cols N columns N (np)
              Tell the kernel that the terminal has N columns.
Do a 'stty -a' and look at the output.
Note:
These is another way to guess the terminal size - termcap and/or terminfo
files. BUT programs are not required to use that info. Also the TERM
variable may be wrong set/unset. And the xterm terminfo entry probably has
80x25 specified - imagine you just grabbed a corner with your mouse and
made the window a little bigger ..... So I think the kernel setting is the 
'authorative' one.

Hope that made things clearer :-)
