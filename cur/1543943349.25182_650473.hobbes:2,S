Subject: [PATCH 03/11] NFS: Update help text for CONFIG_NFS_FS
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/2/8/289

Clean up: refresh the help text for Kconfig items related to the NFS
client.  Remove obsolete URLs, and make the language consistent among
the options.
Also move the ROOT_NFS config option next to the options related to the
NFS client.

-	  If you are connected to some other (usually local) Unix computer
-	  (using SLIP, PLIP, PPP or Ethernet) and want to mount files residing
-	  on that computer (the NFS server) using the Network File Sharing
-	  protocol, say Y. "Mounting files" means that the client can access
-	  the files with usual UNIX commands as if they were sitting on the
-	  client's hard disk. For this to work, the server must run the
-	  programs nfsd and mountd (but does not need to have NFS file system
-	  support enabled in its kernel). NFS is explained in the Network
-	  Administrator's Guide, available from
-	  <
http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#guide>,
 on its man page: "man
-	  nfs", and in the NFS-HOWTO.
+	  Choose Y here if you want to access files residing on other
+	  computers using Sun's Network File System protocol.  To compile
+	  this file system support as a module, choose M here: the module
+	  will be called nfs.
 
-	  A superior but less widely used alternative to NFS is provided by
-	  the Coda file system; see "Coda file system support" below.
+	  To mount file systems exported by NFS servers, you also need to
+	  install the user space mount.nfs command which can be found in
+	  the Linux nfs-utils package, available from 
http://linux-nfs.org/.
+	  Information about using the mount command is available in the
+	  mount(8) man page.  More detail about the Linux NFS client

-	  This option would enlarge your kernel by about 27 KB.
+	  Below you can choose which versions of the NFS protocol are

-	  There are two packages designed for booting diskless machines over

http://ftp1.sourceforge.net/netboot/>,
 and Etherboot,

-	  Implement the NFSv3 ACL protocol extension for manipulating POSIX
-	  Access Control Lists.  The server should also be compiled with
-	  the NFSv3 ACL protocol extension; see the CONFIG_NFSD_V3_ACL option.
+	  Some NFS servers support an auxiliary NFSv3 ACL protocol that
+	  Sun added to Solaris but never became an official part of the
+	  NFS version 3 protocol.  This protocol extension allows
+	  applications on NFS clients to manipulate POSIX Access Control
+	  Lists on files residing on NFS servers.  NFS servers enforce
+	  ACLs on local files whether this protocol is available or not.
+
+	  Choose Y here if your NFS server supports the Solaris NFSv3 ACL
+	  protocol extension and you want your NFS client to allow
+	  applications to access and modify ACLs on files on the server.
+
+	  Most NFS servers don't support the Solaris NFSv3 ACL protocol
+	  extension.  You can choose N here or specify the "noacl" mount
+	  option to prevent your NFS client from trying to use the NFSv3
+	  ACL protocol.
