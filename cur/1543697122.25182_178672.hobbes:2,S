hi
i am using linux2.6-t9 and i am trying to use suspend to disk
when doing a
< echo -n "disk" > /sys/power/state >
it is suspending real fine.
but it is not resuming at all.
i tried to boot up normally and with resume=/dev/hdb5 ( swap partition ) but 
nothing happens...
it just boots up normally...
i have set /dev/hdb5 as DEFAULT RESUME PARTITION during kernel config...
any ideas?
thanks
