I'm worried about doing all of those find_get_page() things over and over
when the mapped file we are migrating is large.  I suppose one can argue
that that is never going to be the case (e. g. no one in their right mind
would migrate a job with a 300 GB mapped file).  So we are back to the
overlapping set of nodes issue.  Let me look into this some more.
