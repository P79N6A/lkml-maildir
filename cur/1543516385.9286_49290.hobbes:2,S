I don't know what the general intent of pci.txt is, only Martin can
answer that.  Your addition IMHO seems like it belongs in a new
'drivers.txt' not specifically pci.txt, because a lot of the text
applies to all architectures.
Martin already added a pointer to IO-mapping.txt in recent kernels.
And, small error in your text, there is no base_address[] in 2.3.x
kernels.
