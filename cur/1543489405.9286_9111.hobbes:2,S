Which is the easiest way to send a message from the 
kernel to a user application? 
I was thinking of having the user-app listen to a specific
socket port (AF_UNIX). Is this a good idea? 
If so  at which routines should I look to see how this works?
If not, is ther a better approach?
I would really appreciate some help :-) Please e-mail.
Thanks a lot,
  Olaf
