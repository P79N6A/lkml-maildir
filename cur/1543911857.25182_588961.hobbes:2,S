That's a little awkward with something like NPT.  Some CPUID features
should be masked by the availability of NPT support in hardware and
whether kernelspace supports NPT.  To set these feature bits in
userspace, you would have to query kernelspace anyway.
It would be nice to be consistent with the other cpuid flags though.
There is somewhat of a similar issue with migration here.  If we have an
initial set of PV features and down the road, add more, it may be
desirable to enable those features depending on what your network looks
like.  Yeah, I think I agree that userspace is the right place to set
these bits.

Good catch!  I'll update.

Okay.

Thanks.
