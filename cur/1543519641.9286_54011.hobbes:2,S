Subject: Cannot mount SMBFS in 2.2.14pre14

I built kernel 2.2.14pre14 and after booting it I was not able to mount WinNT
shares.  I'm getting message:
	SMBFS: need mount version 6
I added extra printk() in /fs/smbfs/inode.c and saw that structure
smb_mount_data which pointer should be in parameter raw for
smb_read_supper () is filled with zeroes.
There were no such problem with earlier kernels I used (2.2.12, 2.2.13) and
also 2.3.33 I tested recently
I build 2.2.14pre14 with egcs-1.1.2 and gcc-2.95.2 and found no differences 
(both don't work).  
Rebooting 2.2.13 fixes the problem.
