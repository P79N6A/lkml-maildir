[PATCH] I2C: initialize fan_mins in w83781d, asb100 and lm78
Quoting myself:
> While testing, I found a corner case that isn't handled properly. It
> doesn't seem to be handled by the lm78 and the asb100 either. Setting
> fanN_div before ever reading from the chip or setting fanN_min will
> make use of fanN_min while it was never initialized.
The following patch addesses the issue. Tested to work on my AS99127F
rev.1 (which means that only the changes to the w83781d driver were
actually tested). Testers welcome.
