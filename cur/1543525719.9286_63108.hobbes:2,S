OK. I don't know from reading the code whether it will or will not mix
well with the >3K functionality (or even if the latter was planned).
All I  can say is that the >3K is apparently working. now that
we have figured out how it was meant to be triggered. 
Storing the rule number in ppos seems strange. I think you should
have kept the natural ppos semantics and used a map ppos<->rule index.
I've just gone to a bit of trouble to do just that kind of thing.
Now that I understand that mode, I may submit a patch to stop it! :-)

Yes. All I tried to do in this first instance was to make the errors
plain to see, if they are errors! They can be fixed in a second pass.

Well, I disagree, but that's beside the point. The point is that the
code in question is pivotal. Nearly everything in the kernel uses
/proc. Nearly all of it uses that function in generic.c. And after
cleaning it up it looks a lot better, and clean enough for its
problems - if any - to be visible. If you can comment on the lines
I marked with FIXME, that would be helpful.

Probably.

Recursion.
