Hello!
> 2.2.11 adds a sysctl for route cache flushing:         [Alexey?]
No, it was always present, so that it will not help.
Actually, the only change outside of ip_masq made in 2.2.11 was
made in ipv4/devinet.c. Try to backout this change and look what
will occur. If it will help, then it is big puzzle. In this case
you have to describe your configuration in more details.
