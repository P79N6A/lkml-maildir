Currently we use a high bit in the QP type, which is not how we want to
keep it permanently.
What would you suggest, add two additional LL QP types, or change something
more fundamental
in libibverbs and kernel ib core?
We think we can get along quite well with the existing parameters in the
current create QP.
The current user-kernel interface is ok for these new QPs for post_send +
post_recv,
but unfortunately the libibverbs userspace calls don't match exactly how
the LL queues are to be used.
We would need something like the LL QP interface in libehca in libibverbs
to keep that interface generic.
We didn't see a usage yet for LL QP in kernel, so maybe we should continue
that
discussion on general@openfabrics only.
We could provide example code in libehca/samples if needed.
Gruss / Regards
