So doesn't that mean it needs nested blocking? Surely that's better than
failing the operation due to an implementation detail.

Well if you really don't need nested blocking and you want to fail in
the highly unlikely case that someone tries... add the WARN.

I don't know much about the pci layer, so I'm sure you know better than
me whether they are needed or not. But if you think they are not, then
do the WARN rather than return failure.
