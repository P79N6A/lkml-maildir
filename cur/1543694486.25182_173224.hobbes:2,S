fbset really does a great mess, if mixed up with stty. It took me
almost an hour to find the right combination. Now, I have a stable
system, apart from the fact of having to do blind termnal setup for
each VC...

Aha... So, from what you know, is there any possibility (fb, X, X with
ATI drivers, anything else) to use the video output (or the second
head) of radeon cards under Linux? And have you tried your drivers
with 2 cards (one PCI and one AGP)?
And in all cases, why is parameter "mode" not working? If I could set
1280x1024-32@60 from Lilo, most of my problems would be solved...
