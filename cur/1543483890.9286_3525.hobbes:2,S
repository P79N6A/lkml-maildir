Agreed.
However,
   By flagging an interface as 'pointopoint $otherhost', you tell the kernel 
to add an outgoing route to $otherhost. Attaching a network route to a
fictitious class [ABC] network, and a corresponding broadcast route, is 
semantical insanity. 
Yet this is what the kernel does. What possible justification can there be for
the automatic creation of the route which I delete in the second line of this
script? ...
