Weren't there? Hmm. First SMT implementation dates back to 1970.
Or the HEP-1 from 1982. Or the Tera from 1990.
They weren't called SMT though back then.
Irrelevant to the discussion though.
And no, "they didn't run Linux" doesn't cut it in my eyes.
People run Linux on anything, always have, always will.

Pretty big generalization there. But tell me, a HT DualCore CPU - how
DO you think it should end up being visible?
Also, remember the some database vendors have said that they will charge
per cpu package and some have said it's per cpu core.
Whatever interface is chosen have to accomodate both.
