So you can't speak decent C. Tell me something I wouldn't know, will you?
	The only incentive it gives me is to say rm -rf /usr/src/base/procps
and write a sane replacement, that would not be choke-full of useless
features gathered from every friggin' abortion of Missed'em'V, would be
readable, reusable and would not make one vomit at the attempt to read
the code.
	If your code looks like that - it's a worthless pile of junk.
Featuritis-ridden, in bargain. All right, ps(1) is useful so I obviously
need a replacement. It means that I'll have to write it. Give me a week or
two - these days I've got some other stuff that also needs to be done.
