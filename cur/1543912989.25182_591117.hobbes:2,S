My debian installation has a system cronjob that will perform a resync
every first Sunday morning at 1:06 AM:
[root@oscar] cat /etc/cron.d/mdadm
...
6 1 * * 0 root [ -x /usr/share/mdadm/checkarray ] && [ $(date +\%d) -le 7 ] && /usr/share/mdadm/checkarray --cron --all --quiet
I did not read the manpage, but my guess is that 'quiet' will suppress
the mail notification.
Regards,
Patrick
