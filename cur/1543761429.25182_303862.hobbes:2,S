Sure, but not malloc+memset+exit.
How much improvement do these big numerical tasks get from the patch?

What tests?
See, a speedup in a simple malloc+memset could be due to either a simple
transfer of load from user to kscrubd, or it could be due to leveraging the
page-zeroing hardware.
The latter, I expect, if the workload is actually touching every byte of
all the pages.  Is it?
If we're doing kscrubd zeroing via memset() then the total system load
would actually be increased if the application is touching every byte, yes?

Right.  We'd expect that to be a net regression if the application is
touching all of the memory and a net win if it is touching the memory
sparsely, yes?
