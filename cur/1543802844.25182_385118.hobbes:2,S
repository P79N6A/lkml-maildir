Hi,
I think that's wrong: On the long term it doesn't make any difference, but while 
adjusting time, the increase of time changes slope every second (i.e. time will 
advance at different speed) when only adjusting the clock at the end of a second. 
A frequency error should be corrected every time the clock is read. So you can 
either do a correction frequently whenever it's needed ("tick interpolation"), or 
you do it pro-active, even when it's not needed (That's what the 
update_wall_time_one_tick() code does). In my solution I even tried to apply the 
correction between ticks, using a combination of both methods.
What you are proposing is even what we had before, and much worse what can be 
done. The old question: Do you want a fast clock, or an exact clock?
And who said that adjtime() isn't used by ntpd? "disable kernel" does exacltly 
that I think.
As always I may be wrong...
Regards,
Ulrich
