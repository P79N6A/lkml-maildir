But this mapping seems to be just a simple de-coupling tool, and any 
de-coupling by definition does/should not change the underlying 
implementation in any way, while allowing for a dynamic rather than a 
fixed/hardcoded relation between the layers.
So, can you give an example of a link-layer that does not easily de-couple 
from the transport?
Thanks!
