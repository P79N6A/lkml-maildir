i386 is actually a poor cpu for numerical workloads due to the
design of its FPU, so the interest will likely be low there, but...
It looks like the struct pbe is storing a physical address in an
unsigned long; using page frame numbers instead of raw physical
addresses should at least catch 36-bit i386 and a substantial fraction
of PPC highmem (40-bit, so not all) with very little effort. A good
chunk of the VM's arch support address calculation API (if not all)
has been converted to pfn-based calculations already, so we're already
in very good shape, aside from a one-shot format change.
