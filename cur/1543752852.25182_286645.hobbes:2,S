include/linux/*.h is supposed to include only definitions used by other
parts of the kernel.
Definitions used only internally by ltt shall stay in kernel/
This is generally agreed upon, but not yet common practice.
Btw. did you run it through sparse?
Not that I found something, but did not see sparse annotation at first
sight.
