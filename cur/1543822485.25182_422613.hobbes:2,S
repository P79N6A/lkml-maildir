I like the 'slab_is_available()' check.  How about if we simply add
this routine and let the people doing the allocation determine what
allocator to use?
As has already been stated, slab not available does NOT imply that
bootmem can be used.  Heck, on POWER there is even an allocator used
before bootmem.  I doubt we could provide an 'intelligent' routine
to works in all cases.  So, for right now we could/should just provide
the slab not available() check.  There is only one piece of code in
SPARSEMEM that cares about this.
Sound reasonable?
