Hello Russell,

That is because the server is 8000 miles away from me
(other side of the contient) and I am unable to obtain
all the error messages except the kernel panic (last).
FYI, /dev/sda had ID:0 (old drive) and new drive had
ID:1. I have tried all ID configurations but nothing
worked on 2 drive system.

It might also be helpful to note that the following
error shows for both drives before kernel panic:
"parity error detected in Data-in phase"
So, I assume the order of drives are fine. I am
clueless.
Many thanks.
Jimmy
