if a dozen mails werent enough then one more probably wont make a 
difference, especially with your last mail calling Thomas's behavior 
"childish" - when all he did was to try to explain his reasons to you as 
patiently as possible! Thomas is not obliged to teach you or bear with 
you - it is his own free choice. (But if you want to discuss this 
personal angle any further please take the public lists (and other 
people) off the Cc: list, it's getting very off-topic.)
Thomas's stuff is now fully integrated into the -rt tree and it works 
excellently. I have measured a 12 usecs worst-case HR timer-delivery 
latency (using cyclictest). _That_ is the thing i care about.

yes, please, put Andrew (and me too) into that unfortunate position!  
Please, pretty please, get on with the patches!
