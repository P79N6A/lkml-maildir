Serialized how? cpio(1), tar(1), cat(1)ed together, ...? Ship it via FTP or
something, how do you unpack on a traditional filesystem? On a wacky
filesystem?
Note that this has the same performance implications as the targzfilesystem
concept, just the other way around: Instead of unpacking on the fly it is
packing on the fly. And paying a (possibly huge) cost for "simple, everyday
operations" in some cases that can't be distinguished from ones where there
is no such cost is very wrong to me.

But how do you recreate the original "files" later? You only get the
serialized version back. Even worse, if you unpack on top of the original
wacky file, you'd get a wacky file, where the main stream is the serialized
version of the original... Rinse and repeat. [Shudder]

If I want to see it serialized via tar(1), and you via cpio(1), and
somebody else via "take the icon stream, discard everything else", how do
you handle that?

What do you do then?

It makes it much worse, AFAICS.

Right. And if none is found, can we drop this madness?
