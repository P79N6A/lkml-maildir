I don't have an update ready at the moment, nothing critical need
updating and I was waiting to see if the WARN_ON would catch some
stuffs :)
It's probably worth adding a WARN_CONSOLE_UNLOCKED() macro that
does the above rather than fixing all the WARN_ON's don't you
think ? If yes, then I'll do a new patch.
