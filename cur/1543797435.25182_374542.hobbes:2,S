Subject: Linux 2.6 Partition Compat Bug??

All,
I am trying to mount UnixWare slices on Linux 2.6 and I see that the kernel I am running has the following configured:
CONFIG_UNIXWARE_DISKLABEL=y
My system currently has a few logical disks which have UnixWare slices on them (vxfs), and when I try to mount these, I only see a single partition (sdd4 for e.g.) that says GNU HURD or SYSV (which is expected).  And I do not see any other device under /dev that might pertain to the UnixWare slices.  My questions:
1.   What does configuring in the unixware slice support in Linux mean?  Is this a bug that compatibility is claimed but does not actually exist?
Many thanks for your time,
-Deepak
