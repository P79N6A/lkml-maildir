hm - what does 'hog' do, can i download hog.c from somewhere?
the alternating balancing might be due to an uneven number of tasks 
perhaps? If you have 3 tasks on 2 cores then there's no other solution 
to achieve even performance of each task but to rotate them amongst the 
cores.

well, precise/finegrained accounting patches have been available for 
years, the thing with CFS is that there we get them 'for free', because 
CFS needs those metrics for its own logic. That's why this information 
is much closer to reality now. But note: right now what is affected by 
the changes in the CFS patches is /proc/PID/stat (i.e. the per-task 
information that 'top' and 'ps' displays, _not_ /proc/stat) - but more 
accurate /proc/stat could certainly come later on too.
