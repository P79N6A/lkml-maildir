Can?  well, anything is possible.  It's just an SMP - a simple matter
      of programming.
Does? no.  Linux doesn't even support ACLs (without patches)  I know
      of no work to interface any of the ACL patches with NFS, except
      for the NFSv4 work, which doesn't really help you.

Yep.  NFSv3 doesn't know about ACLs. SUN invented an NFS_ACL protocol
which is sufficiently well documented (I have a .x file) that it would
be fairly trivial to implement ... if you had a filesystem that could
store compatible acls.

So the question becomes,  does the price difference mean enough money
that it is worth contracting someone to make it work.... and can you
afford the risks.
