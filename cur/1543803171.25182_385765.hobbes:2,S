Yes ... that's essentially what I said: DMA API makes us kernel
coherent.  However, we explicitly *don't* mandate the way architectures
do this.  It's certainly true, all the ones I know work by flushing the
kernel mapping cache lines, but I don't think you're entitled to rely on
this behaviour ... it's not inconcievable for large external cache
machines that the DMA could be done straight into the kernel cache.

Ah ... perhaps this is the misunderstanding.  To clear the kernel lines
associated with the page you use flush_kernel_dcache_page().
flush_dcache_page() is used to make a page cache page coherent with its
user mappings.

True, but your assumption that a driver should be doing this is what I'm
saying is incorrect.  A driver's job is to deliver data coherently to
the kernel.  The kernel's job is to deliver it coherently to the user.
Perhaps we should take this to linux-arch ... the audience there is well
versed in these arcane problems?
