Now this means you get the "softlockup watchdog" message because of a bug that
hangs your box and is actually detected by the watchdog.  I didn't realize
that before, so please disregard my previous messages.
Have you tried to boot the box with "init=/bin/bash" and suspend?  [You'll have
to mount /proc and /sys, and do "swapon -a" manually before
"echo disk > /sys/power/state".]
