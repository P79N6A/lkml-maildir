Please consider this patch for 2.6.23.2
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/10/4/389
tested by me in
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/10/5/150
to fix the regression first reported in
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/10/3/123
Cause of the wrong display in top is the value of stime in /proc/<pid>/stat 
decreasing occasionally.
The issue is also registered as:
