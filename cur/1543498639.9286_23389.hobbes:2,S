Hello.
Iam seeing while compiling that inline's not showing up and results in
unresolved symbols
during insmod?
i had a init_timer() call and i noticed that i have #include <linux/time.h>
but compilation did not give any warnings or errors, and insmod results in 
unresolved symbol init_timer? any ideas?
Cheers,
ashokr
