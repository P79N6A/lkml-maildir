Subject: [patch] fix .text.exit error in neofb.c
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

The following error occured at the final linking of 2.4.19-rc:
<--  snip  -->
...
drivers/video/video.o(.data+0x46b4): more undefined references to
`local symbols in discarded section .text.exit' follow
...
<--  snip  -->
The following patch fixes it (neofb_remove is __devexit but the pointer to
it didn't use __devexit_p):
