Subject: 2.5.44: what's .tmp_export-objs for?

I accidentally did a 2.5.44 kernel build as root rather than my normal user, 
so I'm trying to see what clean steps I need to so (as root) to be able to 
build the tree again.  A normal make clean failed (permission denied deleting 
files), so I did an su and a make clean.  Exit back to normal user, make 
clean, life is good, do a make dep, and it complains about the directory 
.tmp_export-objs.
1) Why does the build process use a hidden directory?
2) Why isn't make clean removing something with "tmp" in the name?
Just curious,
Rob
