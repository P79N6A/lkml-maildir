  Some on this list think that hardware vendors are afraid of giving away
  trade secrets by developing open source drivers. I don't think that is
  the case at all. Many vendors just don't want to be associated with
  anything as unprofessional as Linux and, in particular, Linux developers.
   
  It really doesn't matter if somebody makes the world's greatest operating
  system. To a vendor, it's just stuff that fits in the box. What does matter
  is the perception that customers have. Customers just don't need to deal
  with a bunch of arrogant snipers who, like small children, keep snapping
  at each other as in some sniveling sibling rivalry.
   
  They also don't need to deal with kernel interfaces which continually
  change, only for the arrogance and vicissitudes of the changer, to
  be changed again when that changer is out-shouted.
   
  If Linux wants to attract professionals, Linux must act in a professional
  manner. To quote, "Nobody ever got fired for specifying IBM." Quite
  the opposite is true of Linux.
   
  The amateur "GPL" fiasco where, like lemmings led to the sea, developers
  have given their work to some cult figure. In addition, some who have no
  rights to do so, have also signed over the work of others to this same
  cult leader. Such activity invalidates any "license" that anybody might
  have thought they had.
   
  So, if you want to play with the big boys, Grow up!
   
  Very Truly Yours,
   
  Skip Anderson
