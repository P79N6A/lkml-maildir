Yes, i can see the problem.
How about interconnecting it with the bugtracker?
If there is a bug, and if it is related to some hardware, it is logged in the database as broken for that kernel version. If the bug is fixed, support status is ok again.
All that needs to be done is entering the device once into the database, status is broken by default, and take it from there?
Then it gets some goals (similar to bugs) assigned if it is a complex device. i.e. for a graphic device:
* 2d graphic support
* 3d graphic support
* framebuffer
* vesa
one can close goals similarly to bugs, and if a second tester find something broken, it gets filed as a bug.
As i see it the system has to be simple to use and if used, provide an advantage to kernel developers. This makes sure it will get used and could provide an instant status about linux hardware support.

Dirk
