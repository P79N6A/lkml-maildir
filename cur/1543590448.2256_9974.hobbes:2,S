While this "thread" is sort of reallly old now; does anyone have
any more solutions to offer? I only recently tried to upgrade my
TP600 from linux-2.4.0-test6 to 2.4.2... And I am stuck with the
above error. Neither of previously proposed solutions (disable
ACPI and build PCMCIA support into kernel instead of a module)
work. My Xircom 100MB+56k still fails with the above error... :(
Any further ideas, what could be done to "fix" this?

             First, by reflection which is noblest;
             second, by imitation, which is the easiest;
             and third, by experience, which is the bitterest.
