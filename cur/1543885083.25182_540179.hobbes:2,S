This is a pretty specific case, that is not very typical to find in the 
usual common event loop dispatch application design.
But strange you went even there, because, as you know, WaitForMultipleObjects
works with HANDLEs, that are the closest thing to the Unix file you can 
find. They can be read (ReadFile/read), written (WriteFile/write), closed 
(CloseHandle/close), duplicated (DuplicateHandle/dup) and waited 
(WaitForMultipleObjects/poll), with a common interface.
And if you *really* want your truly generic WaitForMultipleObjects 
implementation, your only way is to base it on files. Files are our almost 
perfect match to HANDLEs in our world. We have the basic infrastructure 
already there.
