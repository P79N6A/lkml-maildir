I am trying to get inode for an executable program. For example, I wish to 
get inode for /usr/jdk/bin/java file in a module. The following call always 
return an error. Is there a way to get the inode of current process, 
assuming I have access to "current"
PLEASE CC' eyubo@hotmail.com your answers.
Thanks
Eyub
      err = path_lookup("/ /usr/jdk/bin/java", 
LOOKUP_FOLLOW|LOOKUP_DIRECTORY|LOOKUP_NOALT, &nd);
    path_release(&nd);
