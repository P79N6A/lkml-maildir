Subject: 2.6.0-test6: more __init bugs
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Here are some cases where __init code or data is referenced by 
non-__init code.
Questions:
- Is init_module allowed, required or forbidden to be __init?
- Ditto for Scsi_Host_Template.detect()?
- Ditto for net_device->set_config()?
Thanks for looking at these potential bugs, and sorry if I've made 
any mistakes.
Best,
Rob
P.S. All these bugs were found with Cqual, the bug-finding tool
developed by Jeff Foster, John Kodumal, and many others, and available
at 
http://www.cs.umd.edu/~jfoster/cqual/,
 although the currently
released version of cqual only has primitive support for 
__init bug-finding.
Linux 2.6.0-test6:
** Probably a bug:
** drivers/net/tokenring/ibmtr.c:channel_def                          (__init)
   referenced by drivers/net/tokenring/ibmtr.c:ibmtr_probe1()         (__devinit)
     called by drivers/net/tokenring/ibmtr.c:ibmtr_probe()            (__devinit)
     is stored in a dev_link_t->irq.Instance->init()
     returned by drivers/net/pcmcia/ibmtr_cs.c:ibmtr_attach()         (not __init)
Note: So it looks like ibmtr_probe() can be called any time
      a token ring pcmcia card is inserted, which may be after
      init-time
Fix: Make all this stuff non-__init when it's used for the pcmcia 
     version of the driver?
** Probably a bug?
** drivers/net/wan/sdla.c:valid_port                                  (__init)
   referenced by sdla_set_config()                                    (not __init)
Note: sdla_set_config() is stored as a net_device->set_config().
      Is such a function allowed to touch __init data?
Fix: declare valid_port as not __init.
** Possible bug:
** drivers/net/tokenring/3c359.c:xl_init()                            (__init)
     called by xl_probe()                                             (__devinit)
Fix: declare xl_init __devinit or declare xl_probe __init.
Note: xl_probe is used as a pci_driver->probe() field.
** Possible bug:
** drivers/char/ipmi/ipmi_msghandler.c:ipmi_init_msghandler()         (__init)
     called by numerous non-__init functions
Note: ipmi_init_msghandler() is an alias for init_module
Fix: declare ipmi_init_msghandler non-__init.
** Code can be declared __init
** drivers/net/acenic.c:probed                                        (__init)
   referenced by: acenic_probe()                                      (__devinit)
     only caller: ace_module_init()                                   (__init)
Fix: Make acenic_probe() __init?
** Probably not a bug?
** drivers/message/fusion/mptscsih.c:mptscsih_setup()                 (__init)
     called from drivers/message/fusion/mptscsih.c:mptscsih_detect()  (not __init)
Note: mptscsih_detect() is a Scsi_Host_Template.detect() function.
      Can detect() functions be __init?
Fix: either declare mptscsih_setup() non-__init OR
     declare mptscsih_detect() as __init
** Probably not a bug?
** drivers/scsi/qla1280.c:driver_setup                                (__init)
   referenced by qla1280_read_nvram()                                 (not __init)
     called by qla1280_initialize_adapter()                           (not __init)
       called by qla1280_do_device_init()                             (not __init)
         called by qla1280_detect()                                   (not __init)
Note: qla1280_detect is a Scsi_Host_Template->detect() routine.
Fix: make all this stuff __init?
