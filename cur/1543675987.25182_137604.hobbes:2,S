I am going to use it with timer profiling at first.
It is essentially zero effort port, just add the syscall
and config.in entry.
Still, do you have a suggestion for any other interrupt?
For instance, on i386 it can use NMI. It is my understanding
(perhaps incorrect), that using other interrupt can
a) increase precision, if HZ is low, but other interrupt can
fire more often, b) reduce overhead. Also, sometimes you can
do tricks, if hardware allows it. On sparc, for instance,
you can redefine __local_cli() in such a way that all interrupts
would be closed except the profiling interrupt. Then, the
profiler gathers data about people sitting on spinlocks, etc.
This is what I am looking for, but I'm not sufficiently versed
in the architecture for decide if we have a suitable interrupt
source.
