As long as it is done on the server, there is no problem.

Because a rogue client will have access to every uid on the server.
Mapping provides a shield to protect the server.
If mapping is going to be done, then it must be done on the server.
Mapping is only usefull when you are crossing security domains. It is
less than usefull within one security domain since that confuses the
issue of access rights and identity.
