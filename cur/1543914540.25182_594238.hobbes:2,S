I'm not sure exact meaning of "just-added". 
But, update-n_high_memory-node-state-for-memory-hotadd-fix.patch is
necessary for 2.6.23-rc4-mm1.

In my understanding, 
update-n_high_memory-node-state-for-memory-hotadd.patch should be folded
with all of memoryless-nodes-xxxxxxxxxxxx.patch.
It sets N_HIGH_MEMORY for a new node-with-memory.
But if you need specifing of more detail patch, becase N_HIGH_MEMORY is
set in memoryless-nodes-introduce-ask-of-nodes-with-memory.patch, 
I suppose update-n_high_memory-node-state-for-memory-hotadd.patch
should be fold with it.
update-n_high_memory-node-state-for-memory-hotadd-fix.patch
                                                  ^^^
is fixes of update-n_high_memory-node-state-for-memory-hotadd.patch
and memoryless-nodes-no-need-for-kswapd.patch
Is it enough for your question? Or more confuse?
