Plese Read the Document Carefully and Forward it to other hackers or
Driver Programmers.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have got a  Aztech SC-16 3D Sound Card PnP (Plug and Play) with
Windows-95. Also it is Sound Blaster and Sound Blaster Pro Compatable and
Ol3 and mpu401 support added. It works Just fine in Windows with its
Superb 3-D Sound, Stereo capability.
PROBLEM: The Problem which I am facing is that It Plays music CD's from
right  speaker only and other formats from both and excellent. I have
tried everything and now there is no config error.
1. There is no cable Fault as It plays the music CD's from both speakers
in Windows. 
2. The setting are ok and same as those of Windows 95.
3. '.Wav' and '.midi' and '.au' files play well and excellent fro both the
speakers in Linux, but not the music CD.
4. The mixer settings are also checked and no fault is in them.
5. The sound card is recognised and enabled by ISAPNP tools and the conf
file is enclosed as an attachment.
7. I have had a lot of experience with Linux so there is not a stupid or
careless fault.
MY SYSTEM INFO:
-------------
I have Redhat Linux Installed 2.2.1 completely patched and OSS drivers and
latest packages fron Redhat 5.2, Its from when I had installed 2.0.32 it
is not working. Earlier I had Slakware Still it didnt worked it was about
a 1.5 year ago. So it seems a driver problem.
Evidences: The same problem was found with some people installing Redhat
----------
and if you ran the cd player as soon as you booted it played from both but
IN MY CASE IT DOSE'NT PLAY FROM BOTH OF SPEAKERS i.e MUSIC CD's
[THERE IS NO CABLE OR MIXER FAULT]
I have hacked every possibility for a year or so still no breakthrough.
