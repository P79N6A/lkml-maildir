I posted last week at acpi-devel a patch which fake a ECDT.  That should
at least fix your embedded error you encounter.
http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=6561311
Looking your DSDT, the parameter you have to pass at boot are:
ecdt_fake=0x66:0x62:0x10:-1:\\_SB.PCI0.LPCB.EC0
I hope that at least that will correct some obivous errors.
