Yes, but as Linus points out popf is most likely microcoded, thus much 
slower.  Flag dependency is not unique to pushf, many much more common 
instructions (adc, jcc, sbc, cmovcc, movs, stos, ...) have flag 
dependencies, which can still be pipeline forwarded.  I think the raw 
cycle counts speak for themselves, despite the fact that I only measured 
instruction latency, not throughput.  Using a branch to eliminate a 
pushf is thus probably not a win in most cases.
