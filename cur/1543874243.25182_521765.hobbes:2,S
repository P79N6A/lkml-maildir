The issue is 14000 lines of patch to make a parallel subsystem.

If a static volume is simply a non-dynamic volume, then device mapper
can do that too. And countless other things. Which is not an aside.
UBI growing to do all the things that device mapper does is exactly
the thing we should be seeking to avoid.

Sigh. That's precisely why I talked about moving said smarts. This is
nothing that a higher level remapping layer can't address.

False starts that get mainlined delay or prevent things getting done
right. The question is and remains "is UBI the right way to do
things?" Not "is UBI the easiest way to do things?" or "is UBI
something people have already adopted?"
If the right way is instead to extend the block layer and device
mapper to encompass the quirks of NAND in a sensible fashion, then UBI
should not go in.
Let me draw a picture so we have something to argue about:
                     iSCSI/nbd(6)
                          |
filesystem {        swap  |  ext3        ext3     jffs2
                      \   |   |            |       /
               /       \  | dm-crypt->snapshot(5) /
device mapper -|        \ \   |                  /
               |         partitioning           /
               |              |          partitioning(4)
               |        wear leveling(3)  /
               |              |          /
               |      block concatenation
               |       |    |    |     |
               \      bad block remapping(2)   
                       |    |    |     |
MTD raw block {     raw block devices with no smarts(1)
                      /     |     \      \
hardware {         NAND    NAND   NAND   NAND
Notes:
1. This would provide a block device that allowed writing pages and
   a secondary method for erasing whole blocks as well as a method for
   querying/setting out of band information.
2. This would hide erase blocks either by using an embedded table or
   out of band info. This could stack on top of block concatenation if
   desired.
3. This would provide wear leveling, and probably simultaneously
   provide relatively efficient and safe access to write sector 
   and page-sized I/O. Below this level, things had better be
   comfortable with the limitations of NAND if they want to work well.
4. JFFS2 has its own wear-leving scheme, as do several other
   filesystems, so they probably want to bypass this piece of the stack.
5. We don't reimplement higher pieces of the stack (dm-crypt,
   snapshot, etc.).
6. We make some things possible that simply aren't otherwise.
And this picture isn't even interesting yet. Imagine a dm-cache layer
that caches data read from disks in high-speed flash. Or using
dm-mirror to mirror writes to local flash over NBD or to a USB drive.
Neither of these can be done 'right' in a stack split between device
mapper and UBI.
