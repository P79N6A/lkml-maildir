This statement is semantically void.  If you were given a hypothetical 
current_proc_id() function that would tell you, because a userland process 
can (and normally *will*) be rescheduled at any time from one processor to 
another, by the time the hypothetical function returns it's answer it may 
be incorrect.  What use would that be?
