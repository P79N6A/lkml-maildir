I took a second look and realized that Adrian is right about the disabling.
I had overlooked the 'no' part in -fno-unit-at-a-time.
So to try it out I build a gcc with crosstool:
gcc --version:
i686-unknown-linux-gnu-gcc (GCC) 3.4.5
This is the version that should exhibit the behaviour with increased text size.
Build two kernels - one without and one with -funit-at-a-time:
size output:
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
4878494  471580  610304 5960378  5af2ba o-i386/vmlinux
4955008  472934  614400 6042342  5c32e6 o-i386-no-funit-at-a-time/vmlinux
[Last line is with unit-at-a-time disabled as per the filename.]
With a i386 defconfig we see an *increase* in text size if we disable -funit-at-a-time.
That is we see the opposite of the expected.
Now the bug in gcc may have been fixed between 3.4 and 3.4.5 - I dunno.
So this simple test favour to always enable unit-at-a-time.
