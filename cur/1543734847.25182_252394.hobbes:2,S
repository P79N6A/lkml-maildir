I'd like to hear from anyone interested, or has looked into, adding
support for SSC-2 (SCSI Stream Commands -2, i.e., tape devices) explicit
address mode into the Linux OS.
In summary, SSC-2 explicit address mode enables for tape devices:
- robust tagged command queuing
- multi-path I/O
- enhanced error detection and recovery
Thanks...Dave
