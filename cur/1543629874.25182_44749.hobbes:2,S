gettimeofday() returns seconds/microseconds. If you need nanoseconds,
you can read CPU clock cycles in Intel machines with (assembly) rdtsc
instructions and convert, based upon the CPU clock.
If you really need nanosecond resolution in code that may be
interrupted or preempted at any time, you are in a world of hurt.
I suggest you review the requirement. You may need a TMS320C30 or
similar DSP standing alone.
