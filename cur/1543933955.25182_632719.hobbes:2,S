I'm by the way looking at drivers/net/wd.c which my 386 uses for its dual 
mode NE2000/WD8013 clone ISA NIC and while it specifically needs no delay at 
all it seems, the mixed use of out and outb_p seems to suggest that someone 
once thought about that. Would you advice sticking in a udelay(2) manually 
there?
