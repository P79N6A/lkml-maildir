Do people agree about this thing? If we want it in 2.6.18, we should merge 
this soon. I'd prefer to not leave something like this to be a last-minute 
thing before the merge window closes, and I get the feeling that we're 
getting to where this should just go in sooner rather than later.
Comments? Hugh, does the last version address all your concerns?
