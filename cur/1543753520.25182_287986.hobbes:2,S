I'm obviously doing something wrong, I just copied about 40MB of old
kernels (vmlinuz*) and some jpg files into a subdir on my cryptoloop
filesystem, and I measured 4252.2375kB/s realtime and 18819.7879 kB/s CPU
time. This doesn't seem unusably slow, even on my mighty P-II/350 and
eight year old 4GB drives. The hdb is so old it has to run in pio mode, to
give you an idea, and the original data was not in memory.
Undoubtedly your idea of unusably slow is far more demanding than mine...
