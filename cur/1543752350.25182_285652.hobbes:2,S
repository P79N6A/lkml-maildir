Looks like you've linked your kernel's config.h to llh and that causes the 
problem. You shouldn't do that unless you have a specific reason to, 
otherwise you might end up with problems I'm unable to test for (I can't 
check every possible combination of kernel CONFIG_'s).
I'll state that more clearly in the docs.
