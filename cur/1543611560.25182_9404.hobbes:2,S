Because this "works" may very well include exploitable buffer overruns in
kernel mode.  I had seen that - ioctl() assuming that nobody would pass
it deliberately incorrect arguments and doing something like
	copy_from_user(&foo, arg, sizeof(foo));
	copy_from_user(bar, foo.addr, foo.len);
The problem being, seeing what really happens required half an hour of
wading through the shitload of #defines.  _After_ seeing copy_from_user()
in a macro during greap over the tree - that's what had triggered the
further search.

Commented pile of shit is still nothing but a pile of shit.  If you comment
Netscape to hell and back it will still remain a festering dungpile.  Same
for NT, GNOME, yodda, yodda...
