I understand most of that, but I'm still missing why the polling is
needed. Why not have the utility check for low space, purge the user's
files and if space is still too low, contact the daemon to purge other
users' files?
With polling you preemptively purge. I'm suggesting that you only
purge when you run out of space.
Hm. Wait a minute. Now I see what you're driving at. You're referring
to the case where space is needed when putting new files on the
FS. OK. Yeah, regular polling by the daemon could be used to see if
you run out of space. Yep. Let's first see if a polling daemon is
effective before hacking the kernel. The cost of polling should be
really cheap, so doing it once a second or more should be OK.
