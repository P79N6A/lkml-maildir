I'm also interested in receiving file change notifications, especially
as I would like to get this working for Samba in a sane way.
However I don't think your approach would help me much. I simply don't
want to get every file being changed on the whole machine getting 
reported to me.
I don't want to look up the inode every time, just to know if it belongs
to a directory I'm interested in.
Actually I *like* dnotify being local to a given directory and having
a fd so I know where the signal I receive belongs to.
So my selfish reasoning makes me want either
- dnotify being able to pass some more information if requested
  (I actually tried this and it basically works, it is just too
   crappy to post here)
or
- make poll()/epoll() work for file/directory access
So much for what I want :-)
