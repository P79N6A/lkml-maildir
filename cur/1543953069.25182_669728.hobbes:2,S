The card and adapter (right now a Kodak picture card adapter and an old
64MB Kodak CF card, but, as I said, the behaviour is the same with
different adapters and different CF cards) work correctly in my Wife's
Evo running Windows.   The adapter and card work, sometimes, when they
are in the machine at boot (like on my last boot - I have a 
/var/log/messages
with this behaviour, but it isn't very illuminating).   I have had 
several T60p's,
they all act the same.  (The on-site service center swaps machines for us
when we have problems.)
I just updated to the current BIOS (2.21) and ECP (1.07).  Not working.
(Just for the record the kernel is 2.6.24.3-34.fc8 #1 SMP.)
Here are the /var/log/messages after inserting the card and adapter.
