Yes.  My bad: I forwarded a replacement kthread implementation to you
and missed the other subs.  It was 1am on a Monday morning, but
nonetheless.
Do you want me to consolidate the patches in your tree?  At the moment
you're carrying:
kthread-primitive.patch
kthread-affinity-fix.patch
kthread-affinity-fix-fix.patch
kthread-handle-non-booting-CPUs.patch
kthread-stop-using-signals.patch
Which are logically a single "kthread-without-signals" patch.
Rusty.
