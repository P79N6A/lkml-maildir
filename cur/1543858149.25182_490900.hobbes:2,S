FWIW, Kay and Neil recently went back and forth regarding what sorts of 
events to generate for MD online/offline events.  In concept md 
online/offline and dock/undock seem similar enough that the 'change' 
events Kay requested for md probably make sense in the dock/undock 
context as well, but I've Cc'd him just in case.
