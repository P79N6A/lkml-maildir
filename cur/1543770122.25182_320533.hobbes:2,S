Hi,
As I am very new to linux, I was wondering if someone could help me with
a soundcard problem that I have. I am running Fedora Core (2.6 Kernel)
on a Acer eXtensa 367D laptop. The soundcard is a Yamaha SAx OPL3. I
found some information as to how to get it to work, but couldn't
understand it properly.
Has anyone got a simple solution?
Regards,
Matt
