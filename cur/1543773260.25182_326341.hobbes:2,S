Andrew, I'm going to file
	Subject: 2.6.12: connection tracking broken?
	Subject: 2.6.12 cpu-freq conservative governor problem
	Subject: PROBLEM: libata + sata_sil on sil3112 dosen't work proper

Do I understand correctly that the procedure is
	1. Search for duplicates
	2. Choose category
	3. Add "From: Joe Reporter <>" at the beginning, copy-paste email.
	4. Add Joe and relevant lists to CC.
	5. Profi^WCommit
and bugzilla won't shoot unsuspecting guys afterwards?
