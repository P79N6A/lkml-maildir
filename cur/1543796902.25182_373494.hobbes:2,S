Well, they are not aiming at creating a high end gaming card.
Here are some quotes from various documents at 
http://www.opengraphics.org/
  :
"
Requirements
In order to be interesting to the open source community and OEM
vendors such a card should at a minimum meet the following
requirements:
    * Programming interface must be fully documented
    * No IP encumberment for implementing drivers
    * Very good 2d graphics performance
    * Full OpenGL implementation with as much hardware acceleration as possible
    * Good support for xv (yuv->rgb, scaling) for video playback
    * Reasonable price!
"
"
Due to market size it will not be possible to compete on 3d
performance with market leaders such as ATI and NVIDIA. This is not an
immediate problem because gaming is not what this card is aimed at,
but performance should be good enough for scientific simulations and
similar.
"
"
   1.  *Will I be able to play Doom 3 with this hardware?*
Nope, but at the time of this writing, there is no graphics card on
the market on which you can play Doom 3 well while using open source
drivers. Less demanding games are likely to work however.
"
"
With about 6.4 gigabytes/second memory bandwidth, the video
performance should be comparable to current midrange graphic-cards
like the ATI Radeon 9600 which can e.g. play Battlefield 2.
