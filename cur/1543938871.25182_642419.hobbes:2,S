Oh rest assured that you're not alone. I was smiling reading Andrew's
comments about people who "cnat tpye", and I must admit that I too am
often quite irritated by incorrect case and inverted letters, but I try
to refrain from whining, people say that I do it too much and for nothing :-)
OK, here it comes updated.

Subject: [PATCH 1/2] x86: GEODE fix MFGPT input clock value
The GEODE MFGPT code assumed that 32kHz was 32000 Hz while the boards
run on a 32.768 kHz digital watch crystal. In practise, it will not
change the timer's frequency as the skew was only 2.4%, but it
should provide more accurate intervals.
