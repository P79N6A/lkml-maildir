hi 
   thanks a lot it compiled. but while inserting
module
with insmod i am getting errors..
   mymodule.o was compiler for kernel version 2.4.9-9
while this kernel is version 2.4.18-14.
     i am running RedHat-8.0  and  i compile it
including the headers of current running kernel as
mentioned by you only. 
   WHAT COULD BE THE PROBLEM ??????
