These are nice-looking numbers, but one wonders.  If optimising readahead
makes this much difference to postgresql performance then postgresql should
be doing the readahead itself, rather than relying upon the kernel's
ability to guess what the application will be doing in the future.  Because
surely the database can do a better job of that than the kernel.
That would involve using posix_fadvise(POSIX_FADV_RANDOM) to disable kernel
readahead and then using posix_fadvise(POSIX_FADV_WILLNEED) to launch
application-level readahead.
Has this been considered or attempted?
