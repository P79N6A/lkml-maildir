I think your suggested fix is good, but it begs the question:
Why on earth is JFS worried about the filename, anyways?  Why has it
*ever* had *any* behavior other than "string of bytes, delimited with /,
terminated with \0" ?
I read your response about OS/2, and maybe I'm just slow, but I don't
see what that has to do with anything.
Does JFS on AIX have the same buggy behavior?
What behavior was the code originally designed to implement, on OS/2?
Why was that behavior chosen rather than "filenames are a string of
bytes"?
Feel free to point to a "Design of the OS/2 JFS interface" document if
such exists and answers my question. :)
