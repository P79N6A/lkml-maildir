Since I spent a bunch of time fumbling around with this problem, I may as 
well post one last time and put it to bed.  I bet Ingo has a _lot_ better 
way to cure that problem, but...
Yes indeed, pedantic tracking of cpu usage does fix the problem.  It also 
makes for some interesting changes in contest numbers (well, _I_ find them 
interesting;)  If anyone wants to see the numbers, they're attached.  If 
anyone wants to try the attached diff, it's attached too, have fun... the 
standard "you get to keep the pieces" lkml warrantee applies :)  FWIW, it 
works just fine here, and the only time someone now manages to steal ticks 
(one) is (apparently) once in a long while when someone (whose initials 
appear to be IDE:) keeps interrupts disabled for too long.  Nobody has yet 
managed to steal more than one tick.
         The End,
         -Mike
P.S.  ok, so they're micro-ticks... what's a few orders of magnitude :) [unhandled content-type:application/octet-stream][unhandled content-type:application/octet-stream]
