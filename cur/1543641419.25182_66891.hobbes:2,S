  I don't think that it really matters the only thing
that I was thinking of is that you might have 
a case in the future where you would like to break out
some of the stuff into say ... PPC or SPARC NUMA and also
X86 NUMA but still keep the Cache Coherent NUMA configuration
as a base.  But that is just wild talk from somebody
who knows wild talk. :-)
