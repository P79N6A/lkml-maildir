we are not there yet to be able to do this. With NO_HZ the tick is only 
disabled when we go idle - but it still runs (and we rely on it, for 
example in the scheduler code) while we are non-idle. Peter Zijlstra is 
working on the 'high-res scheduler tick' feature to remove the scheduler 
dependencies.
