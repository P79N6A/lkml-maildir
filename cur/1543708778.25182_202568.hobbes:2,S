It's probably about time that was done, yes.

That's a bad design decision that will forever haunt me.  When I first
proposed moving from the PCI DMA model to the generic device DMA model,
the dma_mask was in the wrong place.  Quite a few drivers touched it
themselves outside of the accessor functions, so actually moving it in
to struct device became quite involved, so I took the easy way out and
simply made the entry in struct device a pointer to the real one so that
anything that updated the mask outside of the accessors would still
work.
I suppose I should really do the work as pennance, plus write out a
hundred times "never sacrifice design integrity for expediency", sigh.
