I have an ASUS P5B Deluxe/Core 2 Duo/Intel 965/all SATA (Plextor DVD+ 
Seagate HD) configuration setup - and as of now, no distribution out there 
can install on this configuration.
Information on whether this issue has been fixed is, at best, dubious on 
various Linux forums.
/Does/ the Linux kernel support this configuration? Can it 
install/recognize this hardware configuration?
I'm sorry to ask this question here, but all I need is a correct answer - 
I've never posted here to ask questions, but this issue has been bugging 
me quite a bit.
Thanks,
Martin
