- Download ski from 
http://www.hpl.hp.com/research/linux/ski/download.php
- Compile your kernel for the simulator
- set simulator breakpoint at calibrate_delay
- look at ar.itc and cr.itm (cr.itm must be greater than ar.itc)
Or for debugging on hardware:
-run into loop, press the TOC button, reboot and analyze the dump with 
efi shell + errdump init
