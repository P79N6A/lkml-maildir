I can confirm this also seems to be the case for me, I'm still doing
more testing to confirm this.  But it would seem:
nforce4, transfer of a large mount of data with 4GB+ of RAM I get some
corruption.  This is present on both the nv SATA and also Sil 3112
connected drives.
Using iommu=soft so far seems to be working without any corruption.
I still need to do more testing on other machines which have less
memory (so the IOMMU won't be in use there either) and see if there
are problems there.
