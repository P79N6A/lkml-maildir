Hi,
joining this conversation after reading it on an archive (so am not too sure 
how far it has progressed.)
Me too!
I am having the same problem as you describe.
After booting and an initial (try) use of dhcp (which will fail)
everything works fine.
Until I shutdown then I get something along the lines of "too much work on 
interrupt."
Damn how annoying that was, it's been a while since I have had issues like 
this with a release of a kernel.
Oh well, I'll keep looking into this.
Seeya
