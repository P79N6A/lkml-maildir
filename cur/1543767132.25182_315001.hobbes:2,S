The ppc implementation does have some good ideas that are worth using.  
It's hard to know which of the 23 versions were worth using, but I'm 
getting a picture where at least 2 variants are need.  The atomic ops 
variant should use the single counter as ppc does (why did nobody port 
that to x86?).  A spinlock version is needed at least by parisc.

There are at least two users who need asynchronous semaphore/mutex 
operations: aio_write (which needs to acquire i_sem), and nfs.  
Changing 23 different architectures and verifying that they are 
correct is next to impossible, so it makes sense to have at least 
some unification take place.
