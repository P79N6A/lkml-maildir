One aspect that bothers me is the absence of a success criteria. The
current competition for best VM is a good example. The fact is that every
operating system will fail with a high enough load. The best you can hope
for is a better degradation then the prior release. At the moment both
2.4.10 and 2.4.9-ac16 are better then 2.2.19. But people keep testing
under higher and higher loads and (surprise) they both fail... initiating
a search for better degradation logic.
Without a success criteria, this process cannot end.
Other examples are recent updates for multi-quad NUMA machines and changes
to handle locking problems on 8-way machines.
