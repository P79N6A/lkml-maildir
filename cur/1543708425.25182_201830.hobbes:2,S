 will work.
It didn't compile. I fixed some compile problems so that it works.
I have disabled CRYPTO_OMAC though. And it goes boom when calling
hmac_init (or something like that), the machine halts without Oops.
I've seen the cit_omac is kmalloc'ed. Hmm. Didn't we want to try
to avoid that? Well. Perhaps it should be allocated when the
omac_init is called and freed after omac_final.
Or what about this:
If the user wants OMAC he calls omac_init and passes a pointer to
a buffer where the omac will be computed. omac_init then sets
the omac_update function so that xxx_process will call it. After
the encryption is finished the user calls omac_final and finds
the omac in his buffer.
And shouldn't the omac functions be put into a separate omac.c?
Moving the scatterwalk functions seems like a good idea to me.
Well, here are the compile fixes:
