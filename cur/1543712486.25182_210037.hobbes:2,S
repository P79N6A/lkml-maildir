Testing and breaking in hardware with only black box remote access
sounds crippling.  Hopefully you can work with someone to fix problems
as they occur.

How errors propagate depend on the specifics of what computation
you are doing.

Most likely memory errors.  Do the machines have ECC memory?  Is anything
reporting the ECC memory errors as the occur?

Yes.  Baring I/O related variables.

This may simply be a case where you are not hitting the hardware as
hard.  Or possibly compiler/optimizer bugs.
Or possibly you never ran your job on the faulty hardware?

I don't have any except that universities are usually cheap and go
with the lowest bidder on hardware.
In general tracking this kind of problem comes down to applying
the scientific method.  And carefully looking at and controlling
the variables until a root cause is found.
