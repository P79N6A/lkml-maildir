Wouldn't the very best be to try and find the editor to use in the
following order?  :
A) the value of $EDITOR (if set)
B) the value of $VISUAL (if set)
C) the first editor in a hardcoded list that exists and is executable
(a list could contain for example; vim, vi, elvis, joe, jove, nano,
pico, mcedit, emacs )...
