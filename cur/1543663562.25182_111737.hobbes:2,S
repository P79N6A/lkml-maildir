I am.  This sounds suspiciously like the bug I reported.
But you haven't given quite enough information for me to compare.  Can
you send:
1) Exact Mother board (Tyan what?  Tiger MPX 2466N . . . ?)
2) Do you have DMA turned on for your IDE drives?
3) Are you enabling the AMD chip support for IDE?
. . . and anything else you can find out about the box?
Most importantly . . . does the problem go away if you turn off DMA
support for IDE?
Thanks,
John S.
