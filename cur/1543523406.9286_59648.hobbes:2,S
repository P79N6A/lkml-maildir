I think the only thing that would break would be applications that
used "setproctitle", but then they would probably fail spectacularly.
I suspect that changing the process layout so the environment wasn't
immediately after the arguments would break applications for no gain,
so is unlikely to happen.

I've looked into the source of 2.2 and 2.3 a little more, and the change
looks to be a side-effect of the clean-up done by Al Viro (author listed
in comment in fs/proc/base.c).
It appears to be down to a difference in the semantics of "get_array"
which is used in 2.2, and "access_process_vm" in 2.3.
It looks as if "access_process_vm" will return exactly the memory region
specified, but "get_array" would continue past the end of the memory
region specified looking for a null terminator.
So, although the 2.2 code used arg_end in "get_arg", this was only
the point to start looking for the end, rather than the actual end.
Thus "get_arg" would fetch the whole string used in "setproctitle"
by wandering into the environment area.
It means that my previous simple patch means that /proc/$$/cmdline will
contain all of the command line and environment, which isn't right.
