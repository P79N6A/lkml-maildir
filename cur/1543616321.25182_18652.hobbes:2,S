Well ... maybe *in theory* 2.4.16 should work on a machine with that
little RAM but I'd say in practice Linux has simply outgrown your
machine. Have you tried any other 2.4 kernels, say, before 2.4.10 when
the VM changed?  Have you considered going to a garage sale and spending
the local equivalent of $25 or $30 US for a more powerful computer?

If they named a street after Picabo Street, would it be called Picabo
Street, Street Street or Picabo Street Street?
