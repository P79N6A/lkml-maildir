Sure it needs to apply fixes if they are needed for stability etc.
Please note that if C1HD is not enabled in the BIOS we cannot
force it - some boards do not support it et all (even with fixup).
We may try to apply fixup always but enabling of C1HD _feature_
(your machine should work perfectly without it, if it doesn't i.e.
 overheats then it can also overheat with C1HD under heavy load)
must be leaved to user-space.
Alternatively we can add "forceC1Halt" kernel option
but it simply sucks: it is useless for non nForce2 users,
you can't disable it and you've to maintain it (forever?).
