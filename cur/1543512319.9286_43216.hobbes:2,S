do_munmap() doesn't need the big lock. do_mmap() callers should grab
the semaphore, unless they are sure that nobody else owns the same
context. Big lock on do_mmap() is still needed. do_mmap() in
do_load_elf_binary() is OK (we are the sole owners of context), but in the
do_load_elf_library() it is _not_. Moreover, sys_uselib() may do
interesting things to cloned processes. IMO the right thing would be to
check for the number of mm users.
