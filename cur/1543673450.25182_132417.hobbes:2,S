Yes, easily and it is useful.
I can start an xterm a new PAG that has administrative rights. Or
various system daemons all running with uid 0, but with different access
rights (sendmail/webserver).
It also goes the other way around, different uid's using the same PAG,
if I run a setuid application it can still access my files.
