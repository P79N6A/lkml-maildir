Im aware of that but the OHCI core doesnt do that, it uses the DMA API,
which is entirely reasonable, given its tring to access a DMA-able chunk
of memory.
I *could* write a new driver ohci-ioremapped for all these chips but its
needless duplication which is going to result in bugs bveing fixed in
one ohci driver and not the other.
why not simply expand the DMA API to allow DMA to these easily DMA-able
chips ?
