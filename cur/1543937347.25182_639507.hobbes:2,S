Yes, indeed none of the atomic bit operations functions has LOCK_PREFIX in my version of Linux kernel.

If that is indeed the source of your change_bit function then there is
a problem.  However in my kernel tree there is a LOCK_PREFIX in the
definition of the atomic version.  I don't have your exact source tree
handy, but on a local RHEL4 system, the LOCK_PREFIX is still there:
static inline void change_bit(int nr, volatile unsigned long * addr)
{
        __asm__ __volatile__( LOCK_PREFIX
                "btcl %1,%0"
                :"=m" (ADDR)
                :"Ir" (nr));
}
