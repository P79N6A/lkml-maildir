What Linus says here is correct for PPro and above.  Using a mov
instruction to unlock does work fine on a 486 or Pentium SMP system, but
as of the PPro, this was no longer the case, though the window is so
infintesimally small, most kernels don't hit it (Netware 4/5 uses this
method but it's spinlocks understand this and the code is writtne to
handle it.  The most obvious aberrant behavior was that cache
inconsistencies would occur randomly.  PPro uses lock to signal that the
piplines are no longer invalid and the buffers should be blown out.  
I have seen the behavior Linus describes on a hardware analyzer, BUT
ONLY ON SYSTEMS THAT WERE PPRO AND ABOVE.  I guess the BSD people must
still be on older Pentium hardware and that's why they don't know this
can bite in some cases.
