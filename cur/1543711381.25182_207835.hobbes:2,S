 {

This will blow up if a chip with the same PCI ID and a revision larger
than 2 ever appears.
Also, hpt366_init_one() is __devinit, but it calls d->init_setup, and
all init_setup_*() functions are __init - does not look good.  Hmm,
this is present in many drivers, also in 2.6.x... apparently this is
safe because such devices cannot be hotplugged.
