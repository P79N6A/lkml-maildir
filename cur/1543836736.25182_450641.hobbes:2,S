Hi,

Ive come across this problem a number of times on e1000 chips (to be
clear it was vendor programming issues).
The driver has the option to read and write the EEPROM already. All we
need is the ability for the driver to hang around so that we can use
ethtool to fix it.
At the moment we carry an out of tree patch to do this.
