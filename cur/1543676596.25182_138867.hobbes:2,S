Things have changed since I converted this driver to 2.5.  I no longer
have the 850E chipset mobo with w83781d sensor, but a 875p chipset
mobo, with W83627THF (basically the same as the W83627HF, just with
advance fan control .. prob the Q-Fan option in the Asus board?).
I sorda got the ICH5 talking, and can get the driver loaded for the
W83627THF (as W83627HF), but all the values seems borked.  Unfortunately
I cannot get a spec sheet on the  W83627THF.  Is anybody working on
ICH5/W83627THF support ?
Anyhow, Only change I have made to the w83781d driver, is one line
(just tell it to that if the chip id is 0x72, its also of type
w83726HF), but now (2.5.70-bk1[123]) it segfaults for me on rmmod, where
it did not with 2.5.68 kernels when I still had the other board.  I will
attach a oops tomorrow or such when I get home.
