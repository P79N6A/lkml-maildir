Okay, it took me two hours before I understood this... but here's the
picture that I have in mind now:
	   master->X        (merge point)
		  /|
		 / |
      ^ branch->3  X
 Time |         |  |
      |         2  X
		|  |
	        1  X
		|  |
		 \ |
		  \|
		   X        (branch point)
		   |
Then if I define a branch pointer to point to '3', then the branch is
3--2--1. If next I move the branch pointer to point to '2', node '3' is
no longer on the branch because now the branch exists of 2--1, and
HEAD moves to '2' as well.
This seems to make most sense in the light of your last sentence.
I don't understand how I'd have moved branch pointers however. I thought
I would just change my working copy along the branch by specifying
tag nodes. Ie, I have a branch '3'(--2--1) and I say: give me '2',
then give me '1' - and when I do: git reset --hard HEAD - it moves
me to 3 because the branch was never touched.

Ok - so it does something magical that I don't have to understand :P
The only thing that matters is that I choose the begin and end point,
the first two points, correctly: where one is bad and the other is good.
I seems that git bisect can't deal with swapping good/bad (the 'bad'
one always has to be the newest revision), so I had decided to call
'kernel hangs' good and 'kernel works' bad. The problem then is that
I can't find any starting point anymore that is 'bad'.

The dates on the right side seem to make no sense. Even in a part
where there are no branches/merges at all, the date goes in both
direction (sometimes older, sometimes newer). Roughly it seems that
the newest date is at the top - but I see a lot of times things like:
|||O||  Description   Author1  2007-05-14 03:43:20
|||O||  Description   Author2  2007-05-15 15:10:34
|||O||  Description   Author3  2007-05-13 17:50:27
Thus, there seems to be no time related ordering :/

Yup, I can see that in the gitk --all graph :)

$ git merge origin
fatal: Needed a single revision
Usage: /usr/bin/git-merge [-n] [--no-commit] [--squash] [-s <strategy>]... <merge-message> <head> <remote>+
For some reason I don't think I should be needing commands that need
"<merge-message>"; I don't want to change the (local) tree in anyway.
Isn't there another way to just move master back to the HEAD of origin?

I'd rather first reproduce a working kernel - that should be possible
without pulling in more commits.
