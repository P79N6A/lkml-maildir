CVB doesn't have any alignment requirement (I'm not sure it ever had one).
Execpt for the 'atomic' operations (CS, CSG, CDS, CDSG, LPQ, STPQ, PLO)
I know only of two general-purpose instructions with operand alignment
requirement, and that's LAM and STAM.  As access registers are not
normally used in Linux this shouldn't be a problem.
There *is* a whole bunch of privileged system instructions that have
various aligment requirements; but here I'd say it's fair to require the
user to provide correct aligment in these special cases.
