Even if you don't think that, it's what the current PCI drivers are
expecting.  You're arguing to change about a dozen in-tree drivers
(doable), and some unknown number of others.   When I do changes
like that, I _really_ like to change the argument type enough to make
the compiler start reporting broken drivers!
Maybe rather than changing from values 0-4 into values 0-3, it
should change into string constants naming the states ... if you don't
like typed struct pointers for such things!

/sys/power/state defines also "standby"; these are the PM_SUSPEND_*
enumeration values (other than "on").
But the /sys/bus/*/devices/*/power/state files just read and write numbers.
Those get sent to individual drivers.  Passing (and printing) symbols
would make it more obvious what's going on there.  It'd be good if those
symbols could include bus-specific state names (driver-specific?), as
well as policies like "standby", "mem", and "disk".

System state != driver state though.   I'd agree that there
can be semi-generic policy names though, which various
software (ACPI, platform- or bus-specific code, even drivers)
could try mapping to hardware-specific states.

At one point I heard one of those issues described as "semantics are
bus-specific", but that's only part of it... :(

The "partial tree suspend" works only for the degenerate
tree:  every device in the system!  Wakeup events also need
some more attention.
There's now some partial-tree code in CONFIG_USB_SUSPEND (for
developers only), but jumping from USB into the next level driver
(SCSI, video, etc) raises questions.

Passing PM_SUSPEND_* values (0-3) instead of PCI power states (0-4),
as PCI drivers have previously expected, looks like it ought to be a
simplifying assumption.  Simpler is often good ... though this makes
me suspect "too simple".  Especially since it pushes policy choices
into device drivers (normally not good, except for quirks like "this
driver+hardware can't do D3, so let's use D2")..
