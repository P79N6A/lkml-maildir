I take that to mean `no'.

Good input filtering?  I've never seen anyone be told `no' because their 
patches were too large (in fact, as far as I can see, large slabs of egcs are 
farmed out to largely independent groups, as has effectively happened with 
ISDN under Linux), nor because one of the developers' machines doesn't have 
bz2.
As far as it goes, `good' input filtering for Linux would be able to be done 
by tossing a coin, so long as people were able to select which branches they 
wanted to continue to work on, submit and check out.
Additionally, coins don't get stuck on `no' for things like GGI.
Colin.
