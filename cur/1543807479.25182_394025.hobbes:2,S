Hello!

It is exactly what openvz does, the first task becomes child reaper.
Cedric asked why do we have an init in each container, I answered that
we want to. But openvz approach is enough flexible not to do this, nothing
will break if a container process is reparented to normal init.
The question was not about openvz, it was about (container,pid) approach.
How are you going to reap chidren without a child reaper inside container?
If you reparent all the children to a single init in root container,
what does wait() return? In openvz it returns global pid and child is buried
in peace. If you do not have global pid, you cannot just return private pid.
