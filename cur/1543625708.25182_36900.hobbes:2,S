Time to time, a white noise (hiss) begins to be added to either left or right
channel of played-back mp3's, ogg vorbises, and modules (mpg123, ogg123, xmp).
From that point on, the noise is in the channel permanently except when no
audio output is being performed. Only reboot cures this.
My friend has got the same card and experiences the same problems.
