  Hello Andrew!
  I've noticed that the patch splitting transaction's t_checkpoint_list
into two lists (one for buffers to-be-submitted and one for already
submitted buffers) is not in -mm kernels. Is there any reason why you've
dropped it? If you just missed the version that fixed the bug or some
similar mistake happened then please put the patch into -mm (it's
attached and applies fine against 2.6.12-mm2). Any comments are welcome.
							Thanks
								Honza
