That is, of course, true.
However, the Linux kernel (and quite a few other kernels) is a very 
important customer of gcc, and adding sustainable modes for the kernel 
that we can rely on is probably something we can work with them on.
I think the relationship between the gcc and Linux kernel people is 
unnecessarily infected, and cultivating a more constructive relationship 
would be good.  I suspect a big part of the reason for the oddities is 
that the timeline for the kernel community from making a request into 
gcc until we can actually rely on it is *very* long, and so we end up 
having to working things around no matter what (usually with copious 
invective), and the gcc people have other customers with shorter lead 
times which therefore drive their development more.
