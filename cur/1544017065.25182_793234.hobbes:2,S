I could confirm the igrab() in ecryptfs_interpose(), so touching i_count
in my patch are unnecessary.
Although I don't remember the detail, I have experienced a trouble (and
I wrote the patch). If I can recall the problem and find the
reproducible way, I will write again.
One thing I remember is, vfs_unlink() in ecryptfs_unlink() made
lower_dentry->d_inode NULL unexpectedly.
I guess the problem was related to the i_count including my fixes for
ecryptfs_unlink() and ecryptfs_link(). Current ecryptfs_link() calls
ecryptfs_interpose(), but obviously the inode is not I_NEW and the
incremented i_count is decremented again (finally unchanged).
The current unnecessary d_drop()s may help hiding the problem, but I am
not sure.

Whether the counter is one or more is more important than to hold or not
to hold simply.

I am happy that my patch was not totally useless. :-)
And one more suggestion. It is better to set f_type in
ecryptfs_statfs(), and move ECRYPTFS_SUPER_MAGIC under include/linux/,
in order to be usable from userspace (or other modules).
