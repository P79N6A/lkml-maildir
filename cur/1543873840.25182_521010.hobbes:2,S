Lots of things we do because we just assume they're a good idea without any 
evidence. Renicing kernel threads was always considered a good idea on this 
basis. I'm certain noone has ever proven that it's a good thing though. 
Either way, the latest version of rsdl is robust enough that it works fine 
with reniced kernel threads if you still believe that's advantageous. This is 
definitely open for discussion/opinion.
