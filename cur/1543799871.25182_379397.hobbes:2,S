Subject: [ANNOUNCE] GIT preformatted documentation available.

I was asked to provide pre-formatted man pages (and perhaps html
pages), since the time of kernel developers are better spent on
what they do best, rather than preparing the xmlto toolchain.
I was planning to do a tarball every time I do a "release", but
that would mean it is no better than the current way --- you
could extract manpages out of rpm anyway.
So instead, I'll do independent branches "html" and "man" in
git.git repository to keep the preformatted documentation.
	$ mkdir git.man ; cd git.man
	$ git init-db
        $ ID=$(git fetch-pack -k git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git man)
        $ expr "$ID" : '\(.*\) .*' >.git/refs/heads/master
        $ cat .git/refs/heads/master >.git/refs/heads/origin
	$ git checkout; /bin/ls -aF
	./  ../  .git/	man1/  man7/
        $ echo >.git/remotes/origin <<\EOF
        URL: git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git
        Pull: man:origin
        EOF
Would set you up, and you can
to keep them up-to-date, and install them like so:
	$ cd git.man
	$ git pull
	$ cp -a man1 man7 /usr/local/man/
The "html" branch is similar; it is a copy of what is shown at
http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/.
This means if you clone from git.git repository, you would end
up with something like this in .git/remotes/origin file:
	URL: git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git
        Pull: master:origin
        Pull: todo:todo
        Pull: html:html
        Pull: man:man
        Pull: pu:pu
        Pull: maint:maint
Typically, for the repository to track GIT itself, you would
want to trim them like this:
	URL: git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git
        Pull: master:origin
        Pull: maint:maint
        Pull: +pu:pu
