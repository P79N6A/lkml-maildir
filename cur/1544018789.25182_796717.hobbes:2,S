He noted that he tried another drive, so unless he has a pile of bad drives it's 
probably something else. Being "hdb" may indicate that it's connected to the 
same controller as "hda" and might not be jumpered for slave. Or it might be a 
bad cable, a controller which doesn't like two drives, a dubious power 
connector, etc. Or if he doesn't have an hda, perhaps the kernel doesn't like a 
secondary drive without a primary.
Being hdb instead of sdb with a new kernel indicates he is using a config which 
may get a lot less testing these days, perhaps?
In any case, I doubt he had two bad drives, so something else is more likely.
