I believe my (modest) track record would show that I do follow up on
these things...
But anyway, I believe the renames I've done are not bad one way or the
other and should be acceptable (and some of the long names for local
symbols are chosen based on maintainer feedback even)... but I'll
await more feedback and change the patches if needed.

Hmm, I'll take a look at lock_cpu_hotplug() - can you provide
additional details?

i figured as much. *But* won't you agree that up_sem() (or considering
the other locking function names, sem_up() would probably be better)
would be a much better name for a global like this one?
How about a plan like this:
We introduce sem_up() and sem_down() wrapper functions now. They could
go into 2.6.19 for example - and also add a note to
feature-removal-schedule.txt that the old function names will be
removed in 1 year. Then in a few kernel versions - say 2.6.21 - we
deprecate the old names and add a big fac comment in the source as
well.
Wouldn't that be doable?   Or do we have to live with up()/down() forever?
