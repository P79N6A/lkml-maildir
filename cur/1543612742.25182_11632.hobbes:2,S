A number of people have privately pointed out that hdparm -T doesn't
actually go to the disk at all.  Guess I should RTFM...I though that
this was reading from the disk's cache, not linux's cache.  Oops.
I'm still kind of curious why raid-1 reads don't seem to get any
performance increase over reads from a single disk.  Any ideas?
