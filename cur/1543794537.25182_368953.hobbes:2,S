You have the source code for the compiler?  Put a call to something
like this at the beginning of main().  I'm leaving out the error handling,
you can write that ;)
void startlogging()
{
    pid_t tpid;
    int pfd[2];
    pipe(pfd);
    tpid=fork();
    if(tpid==0) {
        /* child process */
	close(0);
	dup2(pfd[0], 0);
	close(pfd[0]);
	close(pfd[1]);
	execl("/usr/bin/tee", "logfile");
    } else {
	close(1);
	dup2(pfd[1], 1);
	close(pfd[0]);
	close(pfd[1]);
    }
}
