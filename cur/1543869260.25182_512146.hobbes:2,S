+
+General Information:
+
+Various CPUs today support multiple idle levels that are differentiated
+by varying exit latencies and power consumption during idle.
+cpuidle is a generic in-kernel infrastructure that separates
+idle policy (governor) from idle mechanism (driver) and provides a
+standardized infrastructure to support independent development of
+governors and drivers.
+
+cpuidle resides under /drivers/cpuidle.

+
+
+cpuidle driver supports capability detection for a particular system. The
+init and exit routines will be called for each online CPU, with a percpu
+cpuidle_driver object and driver should fill in cpuidle_states inside
+cpuidle_driver depending on the CPU capability.
+
+Driver can handle dynamic state changes (like battery<->AC), by calling
+force_redetect interface.
+
+It is possible to have more than one driver registered at the same time and
+user can switch between drivers using /sysfs interface.
+
+Interfaces:
+int cpuidle_register_driver(struct cpuidle_driver *drv);
+void cpuidle_unregister_driver(struct cpuidle_driver *drv);
+int cpuidle_force_redetect(struct cpuidle_device *dev);

+cpuidle governor is policy routine that decides what idle state to enter at
+any given time. cpuidle core uses different callbacks to governor while
+handling idle entry.
+* select_state callback where governor can determine next idle state to enter
+* prepare_idle callback is called before entering an idle state
+* scan callback is called after a driver forces redetection of the states
+
+More than one governor can be registered at the same time and
+user can switch between drivers using /sysfs interface.
