That is really the way I've implemented it.  The only PC specific file in the 
generic directory is mpparse.c (since neither visws nor voyager has an MP 
compliant bios).  All the shareable files are kept in `kernel' and activated 
by config options.
I can certainly move mpparse.c back to kernel and add an extra (non user 
visible) config option.

It creates directories `generic' for the standard pc and `visws'.  The voyager 
patch creates a `voyager' directory.  Alternatively, these could be `mach-pc', 
`mach-visws' and `mach-voyager'.
