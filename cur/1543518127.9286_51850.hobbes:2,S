Ok, though it only affects PC architectures: pc_keyb.c - is this used
for other architectures as well?  Also, is there a safe way to
intercept/get kbd rate/delay settings?  That would be a good delay to
use...

Well, the delay applies to identical consecutive scancodes (not
keycodes), and only between the first and the second scancode in the
sequence, therefore it only affects keyboard repeats (repeats of
_key_down_ scancodes).  People pressing keys quicly are also
depressing them :-), so this doesn't affects them.
Example (I can only remember the scancode for ESC :-)) sequence of
scancodes (though I am almost sure you understood, there is a slight
chance that my English is not as good as I hope :-)):
- keyboard repeat for escape:
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 81
in which the 250ms delay applies only between the first and the second
- human repeat of ESC:
1 81 1 81 1 81 1 81 1 81 1 81
in which the patch doesn't interefere
