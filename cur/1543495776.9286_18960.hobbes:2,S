Both data and filesystem structure were corrupted.
However, this has been determined to be due to a race condition in
wakeup_bdflush which has been corrected in 2.3.1.  I haven't looked at
2.2.9.  The bdflush changes that exposed the bug have been backed out
of both 2.2.9 and 2.3.1.
I am going to reissue the original patch against 2.3.1 (and possibly
2.3.1-arca) after I shake some more bugs out of it.
