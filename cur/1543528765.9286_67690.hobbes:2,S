The bad skbs message come from NETFILTER_DEBUG. Turn that off.
The hard irq messages mean that the USB driver is not converted to the
new kfree_skb() scheme yet. Replace the kfree_skb that run in interrupt
context with kfree_skb_irq() (or kfree_skb_any() if you are not sure or
if it can run in both process/irq context)

Sounds like a bug -- the PPP driver is probably not reentrant enough for
that.
