While not technically a SCSI driver, dpt_i2o lives in drivers/scsi
and there is a critical fix in the -mm tree that needs to go
into 2.6.15:
dpt_i2o-fix-for-deadlock-condition.patch
I've experienced several hard lockups in dpt_i2o and I have reports
of other people that have the same problem - they are solved with
this patch. It's a pure bugfix, in 2.6.13 the scsi error recovery
api was changed wrt locking and dpt_i2o only got partially updated.
It probably needs to go into 2.6.14.stable too..
Mike.
