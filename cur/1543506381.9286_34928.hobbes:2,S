No need for it if everyone uses PINE 4.10 with the "Roles"
feature.  But if you use Netscape or most other mailers, you're
stuck with one of:
1) Changing your outgoing email address in 'edit-preferences'
ever time you wish to post to l-k, and remembering to do so too.
2) Using 2 or more Netscape "user profiles" which means you have
to grind your world to a complete and total halt, quit netscape,
and restart it as a different user profile, which also has it's
own folders, etc...
3) Use 2 different email programs, one for l-k, and one for other
lists, etc..
4) Use 2 different computers, and mailers.
IMHO, not everyone uses PINE (but I do).  Forcing someone to use
2 profiles is a pain in the ass - AND not everyone uses NS
either.  Other mailers exist, but no-one is going to switch from
the mailer that they use right now for ANY reason, so even
suggesting it is futile.  3 is covered by the above statement,
and 4 isn't feasible for most people either.  No way in hell I'd
manually edit my preferences each time to change outgoing "From:"
just for one list - it would be too easy to forget, and send out
a mail to some customer or something with my other email address.
I personally cant see how any changes made to the list are NOT
going to inconvenience a LOT of people.

So what stops someone from setting:
From: joe@blow.com
X-Sender: rhw@ps.cus.umist.ac.uk
That would be bad for sure!  Remember also that any solution that
someone comes up with, if it allows ANY way of letting an invalid
post into the list, then we might as well keep it the same as it
is.  Tightening things up like other lists will cut off a lot of
the core traffic from l-k thus making it a less useful list.
Kiss bug reports goodbye from a lot of people.
Just some thoughts...
Take care Riley!
