Sounds like the laptop vendor has used short 40 wire cable instead of 80
wire internally to the laptop. This is valid but requires special
knowledge in the driver of those devices who do it.

Can you give me an lspci -vvxxx of that device (or from the box), and
also the output of "dmidecode". That way I can automate the detection in
the new libata pata_ali driver, and if you cc Bartlomiej he can add it
to the old driver (B.Zolnierkiewicz@elka.pw.edu.pl)
