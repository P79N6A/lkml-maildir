The practical question is if this a special purpose hack, or is
this general infrastructure that we expect filesystems to seriously
use.
If this is a special purpose hack then the larger pages and
fragmentation are minor issues, but it's very existence is a problem.
If this is not a special purpose hack and people do use this a lot
then the fragmentation is a problem. 
Your reply indicates that fragmentation is a concern, as does the
initial posting and the more positive threads.  Therefore either
this is a special purpose hack in which case it's existence is
questionable or it fails a general solution and it's existence
is questionable.

Well here is some reality.  Using an FPGA (slow by definition)
connected to a hypertransport interface I have exceeded a gigabyte a
second, without even setting up scatter gather.
All of the I/O on all of the peripheral busses happens in sub 
1 page chunks.
At the rates we are talking for disks the issue is really how to
bury the disk latency.  For fast arrays how do you submit enough
request to bury the latency. 
I can't possibly believe any of this is about the cost of processing
a request, but rather the problem that some devices don't have a large
enough pool of requests to keep them busy if you submit the requests
in a 4K page sizes.
This all sounds like a device design issue rather than anything more
significant, and it doesn't sound like a long term trend.  Market
pressure should fix the hardware.
