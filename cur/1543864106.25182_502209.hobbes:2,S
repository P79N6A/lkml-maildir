The issue is generic.  It shows up with JTAG (which you can
view as an application of SPI) as well as various other tools
I've seen.  As for rare ... hard to say.  I don't design boards,
and the ones where I look at SPI support have real MMC hardware
so they don't need mmc-over-spi.

Right.

OK, fine.  Temporary toggling of chipselect polarity ... that
doesn't _quite_ feel like a hack!

I think those controllers are best viewed as not talking SPI.
Or alternatively, as being so bare-bones that they expect to
have chipselects managed outside the controller.  (Which is not
a bad approach after all.)
