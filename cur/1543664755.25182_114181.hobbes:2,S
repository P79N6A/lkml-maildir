Me too... I would not think so, but who know.
However at least the freeze was reproducable here. Just take two
pdc20268 controller, attach one driver per channel, setup a raid5, let
it build up the raid. Then start bonnie and you will get a freeze within
15min when using something higher than mdma0.
The system now is really rock stable with these htp370 based
dawicontrol-100 cards (which are in the same slots as the pdcs were).
