Hello, Everyone,
I think i have met lots of troubles when i am programming in the kernel, so, i
want to get
some help.
One of my troubles is that, sometimes, the program can work well, but sometimes,
there are
kernel panics. So, does someone else meet such questions, what is the major
reasons? From the
indication of the log messages, i can find the messages on allocting the memory, i
remember, 
i use the kmalloc to do it, but is there something wrong? 
Thanks,
-
