Since the code doesn't dequeue itself, enqueue seems fine to keep
at least the queued messages ordered. But you need to grab
dev->queue_lock, otherwise you risk corrupting qdisc internal data.
You should probably also deal with the noqueue-qdisc, which doesn't
have an enqueue function. So it should look something like this:
while (!spin_trylock(&np->dev->xmit_lock)) {
	if (np->dev->xmit_lock_owner == smp_processor_id()) {
		struct Qdisc *q;
		rcu_read_lock();
		q = rcu_dereference(dev->qdisc);
		if (q->enqueue) {
			spin_lock(&dev->queue_lock);
			q->ops->enqueue(skb, q);
			spin_unlock(&dev->queue_lock);
			netif_schedule(np->dev);
		} else
			kfree_skb(skb);
		rcu_read_unlock();
		return;
	}
}
