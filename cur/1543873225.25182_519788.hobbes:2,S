I really have no idea about this problem.

Last time I saw an NPTL patch, it was for something like 2.4.21 patched
with O(1) scheduler. I bet you'll have a hard time merging those together
in 2.4.28. It is also possible that core dumps don't look the same. I
have in mind some old changes about thread core dumps, but that's too
far away to say anything reliable on the subject. Check that your core
files are of the same sizes between NPTL and no-NPTL kernels.
Alternatively, you could try RHEL3's kernel (2.4.21) which has all those
things and which is still supported.
