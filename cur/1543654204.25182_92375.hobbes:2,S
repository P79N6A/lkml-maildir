Hello,
I would like to start running some of the 2.5.x kernels for testing
purposes on a wide selection (about 12 machines) of Intel x86 PCs that I
have collected for testing purposes.
I would like to have one build machine where I build a kernel and then
use that kernel on all of the test PCs. I do not want to build a kernel
for each machine.
The PCs have very different hardware and I'd like to play around with
different c libraries on these PCs. So, what would be the best way to
build a kernel that would work in this type of environment?
Thank you,
Brad
