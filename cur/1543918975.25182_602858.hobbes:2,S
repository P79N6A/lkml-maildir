This issue has hit me enough times where I've played with a few other
ideas. I just haven't had the time to finish them. The main problem is if
the system locks up somewhere we have a lock held that keeps us from
scheduling. Once that happens in -rt, we are as good as dead. Since you
can't get much info out without a JTAG or some other mechanism.
One thought I had was to create a small handler that could read the serial
and place data into a buffer. This handler would be a IRQ_NODELAY, and it
would wake up a serial thread to handle the data just like it would for
normal serial output. But the serial thread would just read from the
buffer instead of the serial itself.  In the case of a sysrq key coming
in, the IRQ_NODELAY handler would handle it.
Just a thought. Maybe someday I can get time to play more with this idea,
or someone else can come up with one.  But to convert the entire handler
into nodelay is a bit extreme.
