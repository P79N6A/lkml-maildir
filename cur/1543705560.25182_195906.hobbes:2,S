Roughly speaking - what you want is impossible.
The kernel knows about 13 types of key, and among these are
KT_LATIN, KT_LETTER, KT_DEAD.
Something cannot be both KT_LETTER and KT_DEAD.

[And then, on the other hand, little is really impossible with the
Linux keyboard driver. You have 256 keymaps to play with, and can
use capslock to select a new keymap and on that map use any assignments
you like.]
