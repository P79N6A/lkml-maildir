Sure, but the window of opportunity necessary for sales
has been lost. That's how these thieves live. They start
a company with the secret backing of a mother-ship like
(name any Pacific rim company). They clone the US product.
Then they sell and ship. Once a distribution problem
exists, of any kind BTW, the company disappears.
The local resellers know only that a lower cost thingy,
that worked just as good as the US advertised box,
became available that allowed them to serve their
customers at a lower cost, while improving the
distributors profit. These are all altruistic.
There is no avenue for a lawsuit here.
FYI, in the 60s you could buy "transistor radios"
made in USA. They were made in Usa, Japan, and they
carried a "RCA Victrola" label. Everything was
designed to deceive, including the name of a city
that was incorporated solely to deceive Americans
at a time when Americans were being taught to
buy American products.
