Hi.. well this is off-topic sorry.. somebody is going to kill me
but.. somebody has to make sure about this,
Being aware about the new Microsoft "world domination" attempt with its
.NET platform and after years watching how the Internet is getting more
and more commercial (well this maybe is not that bad while freedom be
respected).. I would like to propose the following: (and maybe it exist
already if so tell me please and sorry!).
We need a free, libre, Internet Search Engine.. we should coordinate this
from all the international LUG's.. this Internet search engine should be
not for profit but to ensure in the future that all of us will have a
site of reference to query for all pages/information/documentation in the
Internet without economical or other kind of interests interfering.
We also should made sure that in the future every document in the Internet
could have a chance to be indexed in order to be founded from every place
around the world.
Maybe this is not for tomorrow.. but a libre search engine is something
needed..
Sorry very much, for my english that I am trying to improve and for my
off-topic.. but I think is necessary to mention the possibility of a
project like this. 
Sorry and thank you very much indeed. If you believe in this idea please
write the FSF so they could coordinate all the effort.
God bless you all!!
Regards
Roberto
