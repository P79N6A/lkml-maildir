the question would be:
 - if you remove the acpi_use_timer_override boot flag
 - and if you boot a kernel with this hack applied
=> do those weird PATA failures come back?
If the failues do _not_ come back then the problem is somehow 
affected/worked-around by the IO-APIC code that generates the above 4 
lines. If the failures are still the same then the above 4 lines are 
really just an uninteresting side-effect of the acpi_use_timer_override 
flag - and the real side-effects (that fixes PATA on your box) are to be 
found elsewhere.
Sadly, the latter variant is the expected answer.
