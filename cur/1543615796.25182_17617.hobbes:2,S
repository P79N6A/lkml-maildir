There should be some part of the kernel that assume a certain scheduler
behavior. There was a guy that reported a bad  hdparm  performance and i
tried it. By running  hdparm -t  my system has a context switch of 20-30
and an irq load of about 100-110.
The scheduler itself, even if you code it in visual basic, cannot make
this with such loads.
Did you try to profile the kernel ?
