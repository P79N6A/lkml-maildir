We are aware of the limitations, this approach has. It is not designed to make
every bit of executed code trusted, because that what just be the same as
before. Everything would be given the same amount of trust.
What we do, is establish a caste of binaries and processes more trusted than the
rest, which could be used for special tasks.

No, it  does not. We do check any executable pages.
