I'd like to make a read-only /proc file which supports inotify -- that
is, the kernel can send change notifications to userland via the
inotify mechanism.  I've found fsnotify_modify() (in
include/linux/fsnotify.h) which seems to do what I want, but it takes
a struct dentry * -- how can I get a dentry from a struct
proc_dir_entry and increment its ref count to keep it around?  Any
help would be appreciated.  Thanks!
