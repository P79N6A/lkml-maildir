Sorry to jump in late. For embedded stuff we should be able to skip
ticks until something _really_ happens, like an interrupt.
So we need to be able to skip ticks several seconds at a time. Ticks
should be event driven. For embedded systems option B is really
the only way to go to take advantage of the power savings.
Of course the situation is different on servers, where the goal is
to save ticks to be able to run more virtual machines. And then
cutting down the ticks down to few per second does the trick.
