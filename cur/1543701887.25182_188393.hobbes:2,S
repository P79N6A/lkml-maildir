Unexplained corruptions. Coder's nightmare. ;) Yes, that's always really
bad. Unfortunately I don't have such a machine so I can't help trying to
nail it down.

Sure, we agree on that point. I think everyone does.
BTW, I've found a not too complicated workaround for my particular
original problem so the bi_idx issue isn't a showstopper for my
device-mapper target. But apart from that the rewinding bi_idx to zero
thing still gives me headaches just being there. A small non-invasive
workaround won't make it much worse, it's hopefully going to die anyway.
Thanks for being patient with me. :-)
