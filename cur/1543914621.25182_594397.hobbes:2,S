-	  You also need to say Y here if you have a device which speaks

+	    or iSCSI,
+	  - for non-SCSI hardware which speaks SCSI protocols, such as USB
+	    storage devices or the parallel port version of Iomega Zip drive,
+	  - for non-SCSI hardware whose drivers translate from and to SCSI
+	    protocols, like the IDE-SCSI emulation driver and most notably
+	    for all SATA drivers.
 
 	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here and read
 	  <file:Documentation/scsi/scsi.txt>.
 	  The module will be called scsi_mod.

+
+	  Subsequent options in this menu enable specific SCSI command set
+	  support for harddisks, CD/DVD-ROM/R/W, tapes etc..  This menu also
+	  presents options for specific SCSI controllers, while options for
+	  some other SCSI transports and all non-SCSI controllers are located
+	  in other menus (SATA, USB, FireWire etc.).
