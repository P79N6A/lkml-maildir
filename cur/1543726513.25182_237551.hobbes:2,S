Twice while using -L2 my IBM PS2 keyboard has become completely
non-responsive. USB mouse and everything else seems to be fine, but no
LEDs or anything from the keyboard.
On both occasions the last key I hit on the keyboard was numlock and the
numlock did not come on and I had to reboot after that.
UP, x86, gcc 2.95, scsi + ide, bttv
Resolved in M5?
Regards,
Shane
