Subject: linux/kernel/acct.c in 2.2.4, filp_close requires 2 parameters

I looked at the function definition in the fs.h, and sure enough, it
requires two arguments.  I have absolutely no idea what to include as
the second argument in  those functions.
Here is the error:
gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/usr/src/linux/include -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer -pipe -fno-strength-reduce -m486 -malign-loops=2 -malign-jumps=2 -malign-functions=2 -DCPU=586   -c -o acct.o acct.c
acct.c: In function `sys_acct':
acct.c:197: too few arguments to function `filp_close'
acct.c:203: too few arguments to function `filp_close'
Here is where filp_close is declared:
root:reliant linux$ grep filp_close /usr/include/linux/*.h 
/usr/include/linux/fs.h:extern int filp_close(struct file *, fl_owner_t id);
The relevant lines from acct.c:
        if (old_acct) {
                do_acct_process(0,old_acct);
                filp_close(old_acct);
        }
out:
        unlock_kernel();
        return error;
out_err:
        filp_close(file);
        goto out;
}
Any ideas on how to fix this?  Disabling BSD Process Accounting "fixes"
it, by avoiding it (which really isn't a fix), but the Configuration
help tells me that using BSD Process accounting is actually a good idea.
Did someone forget to check the function definition or what?  The
filp_close in fs.h appears to be brand new, according to the patch.
