Subject: 2.6.6-bk9 - compile failure if sysfs disabled
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

If sysfs is disabled in the config under pseudo filesystems,
lib/kobject.c: In function `kobject_rename':
lib/kobject.c:395: error: void value not ignored as it ought to be
make[1]: *** [lib/kobject.o] Error 1
make: *** [lib] Error 2
Line 395 is this:
error = sysfs_rename_dir(kobj, new_name);
Now, before anyone chides me for blindly disabling sysfs, I only came across this in helping someone else, who erroneously disabled it, solve this build failure :-)
My apologies if this is already known or expected. It just seems to me that it ought not to end in a build failure and is possibly something you folks would like to know about.
Note that I'm not saying this started in -bk9 because I've never previously compiled one without sysfs. This is, however, what the original user was building.
Thanks folks (for everything you do),
Mike
