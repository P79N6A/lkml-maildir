Hi Ingo,
Those new fast nanoseconds resolution clock APIs are nice but it seems
to me that their naming and _where_ they are implemented in the tree is
a little odd, IMO.
We have:
1. sched_clock() is in kernel/sched.c (weak implementation)
2. sched_clock() is in arch/i386/kernel/tsc.c (architecture override)
3. rq_clock() is in kernel/sched.c
4. cpu_clock() is in kernel/sched.c
I would suggest:
1. rename sched_clock() (remove sched_ as it's not sched specific
anymore) and place it in kernel/time/...
2. rename the architecture specific version of it too 
This first function is the basic fast ns clock
3. base your rq_clock() on cpu_clock() (#4) or use the later directly.
This is local to sched.c
4. move cpu_clock() in kernel/time/...
This the per-cpu monotonic version.
See my point? Base the scheduler clock from a general kernel API, not
the other way around.
Just a suggestion.
Best regards,
- Eric
