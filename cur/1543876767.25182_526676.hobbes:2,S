Subject: [PATCH] [TRIVIAL]  remove duplicate include
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Thomas's patch for including <asm/apic.h> for x86 UP builds came into
Linus's tree from two different directions, both of which were merged.
This reverts the latter, yanking out the duplicate #include and comment.
