This isn't quite enough.  We do want to be able to assign a ranking to 
members of the accessed-once set, and we do want to distinguish between newly 
created pages and pages that have aged all the way to zero.

While on that topic, could somebody please explain to me why exponential 
aging is better than linear aging by a suitably chosen increment?  It's clear 
what's wrong with it: after 32 hits you lose all further information.  I 
suspect there are more problems with it than that.
