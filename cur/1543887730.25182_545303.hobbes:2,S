The rationale for the 'select' here was to attempt to prevent user
confusion since MD_RAID456 now depends on ASYNC_TX_DMA.

I agree it should not be forced on all users, I will push the following
change:

          A RAID-5 set of N drives with a capacity of C MB per drive
provides
          the capacity of C * (N - 1) MB, and protects against a failure
However this still will not allow s390 to build MD_RAID456.  This
dependency is in place because the xor.o object has moved from
drivers/md to drivers/dma.  The goal of the interface is to support
using offload engines when they are present, and use software routines
(like xor_block) when engines are not available.  In other words, the
intent is that DMA_ENGINE=n && ASYNC_TX_DMA=y is a valid configuration.
Can we rework the !S390 change to the DMA_ENGINE menu?  It seems to me
that S390 should follow the ARM example and only enable the driver menus
they want in arch/s390/Kconfig, no?
...
On a closer look, it seems async_tx should be its own directory like
crypto...  I'll post the incremental changes to the md-accel git tree
for review.
