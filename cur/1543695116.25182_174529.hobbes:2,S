Subject: 2.4.23-pre8: link error with multiple USB Gadget drivers

I'm getting the following link error when trying to compile multiple 
Gadget drivers statically into the kernel:
<--  snip  -->
...
ld -m elf_i386  -r -o built-in.o net2280.o g_zero.o g_ether.o
g_ether.o(.text+0x1a60): In function `usb_gadget_get_string':
: multiple definition of `usb_gadget_get_string'
g_zero.o(.text+0xe50): first defined here
make[3]: *** [built-in.o] Error 1
make[3]: Leaving directory `/home/bunk/linux/kernel-2.4/linux-2.4.23-pre8-full/drivers/usb/gadget'
<--  snip  -->
IIRC this issue was fixed many months ago in 2.6, and a similar fix 
(disallowing multiple Gatget drivers) is also needed in 2.4 .
