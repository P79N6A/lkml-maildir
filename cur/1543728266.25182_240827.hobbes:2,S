The minix fs has something different in kernel 2.6 such that "du" fails badly.
du is returning quantities that are approximately 1/4th of what is correct.
It was working fine in 2.4.
I'm not sure if anyone but me still cares...
Tomsrtbt creates filesystem sizes on ramdisks throughout its build that are
calculated from du results to build things just big enough without waste.
It seems to not be buildable on 2.6.
