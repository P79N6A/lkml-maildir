I've been using the scsi-idle patch for a long time, and it has its share
of problems (enough that I've stopped using it again).  What happens is
if a disk has spun down, and you try to read a file which is partially
cached in memory, then the disk doesn't spin up, and your session hangs
and is uninterruptable...  Someone who knows more would probably be able
to find the missed path in the scsi driver which wakes the disk.
Cheers, Andreas
