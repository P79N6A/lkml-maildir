The comment is misleading anyways. AFAIK several of the modern
CPUs (at least K8, later P4s, Core2, POWER4+, PPC970) have prefetch 
predictors advanced enough to follow several streams forward and backwards
in parallel.
I hit this while doing NUMA benchmarking for example.
Most likely to be really unpredictable you need to use a
true RND and somehow make sure still the full cache range 
is covered.
