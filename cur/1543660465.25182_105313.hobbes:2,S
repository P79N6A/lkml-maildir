Sorry for late quibbles, but wouldn't patch below be better?  Linus
did intend that change to the occasionally criticized 2.4 behaviour,
this preserves that change while avoiding the bug which hit David.
You may notice I've sneaked a ~VM_SHARED in there too.  Not because
I can say it's necessary, but the VM_MAYWRITE, VM_SHARED treatment
is already weird, I'd feel safer if we keep to the same combination
as already exists in the !FMODE_WRITE case (see do_mmap_pgoff).
