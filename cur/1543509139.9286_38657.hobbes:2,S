As I mentioned, it may have been coincidence but one of the sequences was
closely timed and the last one below had the reset clock problem so I
couldn't tell.
The suspicious thing is that I have a lot of debugging turned on generating
syslog messages and each sequence was uninterrupted by other messages.
I thought perhaps there was code somewhere (unlikely to be in the kernel, but
possibly in a kernel utility) that was doing a soft-panic and 'init 6'ing...
I'm glad that doesn't appear to be the case.
Thanks
