Red Hat broke it up back when "domainname" (in user space) was the NIS 
domain --- resulting in a lot of confusion when people tried to set the DNS 
domain name with the NIS domainname command.  Presumably they'll need to 
rearrange things again to make it all fit with a kernel that "knows" about 
DNS domain names.
