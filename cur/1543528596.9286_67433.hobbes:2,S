As far AS i know currently linux does not have in the procefs perfomance
data about disk transfers by partitions, transfer bytes information (to
measure trasfered size) and cache hits/misses information. All of this can
be really helpfull for perfomance monitoring. I know the such patch exists
and I'm wondering if it would be added so 2.4.x would have such perfomance
data avaible.
Best Regards
