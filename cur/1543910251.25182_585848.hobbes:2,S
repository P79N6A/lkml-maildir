The problem is that if the cpu is idle _before_ the measurements, the
frequency will change differently from one cpu to another. Therefore,
the cycle counters may have large offsets when you start your tests. So,
if get_cycles() is executed on different CPUs (thread being migrated)
between the beginning and the end of the test, the results would be
skewed.
