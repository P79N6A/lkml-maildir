The use of the key word 'volatile' has gone just a bit too far in
some cases.
given:
funct()
{
   volatile unsigned int;
}
Is plain dumb. There is nobody else that can touch that local
variable except the code in funct(). Even if it's recursive,
the Nth invocation still can't (using legal 'C' code) touch
that variable. Therefore, it should not be declared volatile.
Another problem with 'volatile' has to do with pointers. When
it's possible for some object to be modified by some external
influence, we see:
	volatile struct whatever *ptr;
Now, it's unclear if gcc knows that we don't give a damn about
the address contained in 'ptr'. We know that it's not going to
change. What we are concerned with are the items within the
'struct whatever'. From what I've seen, gcc just reloads the
pointer.
Cheers,
