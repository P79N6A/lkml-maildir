you are misunderstanding how atomic_inc_and_test() works. The processor
guarantees this. This is the crux of SMP atomic operations. How otherwise
could we reliably build read-write spinlocks.
yes, there is no atomic_inc_and_test() yet. (it's a bit tricky to
implement but pretty much analogous to read-write locks, we probably need
to shift values down by one to get the 'just increased from -1 to 0' event
via the zero flag, and get the 'just decreased from 0 to -1' event via the
sign flag.) Also note that this is all fiction yet because we _are_
holding the kernel lock for these situations in 2.2.
