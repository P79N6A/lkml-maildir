Alan, I agree with Arjan's solution as well.  From a very novice point 
of view, it makes sense to #define HZ as a syscall (which it technically 
should be anyway, right?).  Any performance hit isn't our problem... 
people should have been using the syscall to begin with... we're just 
forcing it on them this way!  :-)  That's my $0.02
