I can make a kernel driver that compiles statically
and also uses a non-GPL library, even in the form of
a binary .o file, and the "tainted" mechanism as it
is today will miss it entirely.

The real question is whether or not the kernel
code should be encumbered with legal issues. The
fact that this or that piece of code is or isn't GPL
should be in a text file attached to the kernel 
tarball. This sort of thing has no place in the 
code : countless patches with useful code that
should live in userland have been (rightfully)
rejected as having no place inside the kernel, why
should code that deals with legal issues and is
pretty much dead weight from a technical standpoint
be allowed in ?
