I have questions regarding character devices for IDE drives.  I've
tried asking Andre Hedrick, but he hasn't responded, and is probably
busy with other things -- no big deal.  So I'll send out my questions
to the community.  I'll immediately claim I have no extended
knowledge of the IDE drivers, and I've just been reading through the
code and evaluating how it works. :)
---
I'm working on creating a raw I/O mechanism for writing data out to an
IDE disk.  Right now, I'm putting my own request list together with
the code below.  Note that I'm calling ide_do_drive_cmd(), which isn't
the way to do it at _all_, and I'd rather use some other mechanism.
Eventually I'll have a function to handle this ...
I could call start_request() on my own, but there's the issue if you
have other requests in the queue.  My ide_raw_read() needs to do the
appropriate locking, especially if it wants to call do_rw_disk() ...
My questions are:
1)  What's the best "supported" mechanism for doing this?  I've already
    setup the file_operations[] table to use ide_raw_read() for a new
    register_chrdev() link, and we call ide_raw_read(), and then we set
    up the request by hand, but should I be using another function, or
    perhaps calling start_request() on my own?
2)  The one problem I have right now is I can't specify the disk
    offset (which is, of course, a _bad_ thing).  This requires using
    a different front-end to the problem.  The do_rw_disk() is a great
    function for that purpose, but it requires that I setup a number
    of lock conditions before calling it.  If that's the next best
    alternative, what locks are required in the request path for
    using that function?  (I know it's eventually called via the
    ide_driver_t path).
