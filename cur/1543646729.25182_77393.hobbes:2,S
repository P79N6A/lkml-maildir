Err ... but you *can't* get away with the GPL if you distribute the
kernel you modified, e.g. by selling your appliances. Unless you live in
a country without copyright law, you are allowed to distribute
linux-based software only if you enable source distribution too.
Trying to actively fold your modifications into the mainline is another
matter.
