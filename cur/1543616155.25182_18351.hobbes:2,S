Subject: binfmt_misc module gets stuck

Hello, Alexander!
I'm using Linux 2.4.18pre2 on i686.  I compiled binfmt_misc as module.  I
can load it using modprobe but I cannot unload it.
I wrote some debugging code tracking how the use counter changes.  It 
turns out that the call to kern_mount() in init_misc_binfmt() increases 
the counter when the module is loaded.  kern_umount() is called when the 
module is unloaded, but this code cannot be executed before the use count 
becomes 0, which requires calling kern_umount().
I understand that kern_mount() is supposed to mount the filesystem.  On
the other hand, I scanned the LKML archives and found that
/proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc is supposed to be mounted from the userspace - it 
is no longer mounted by the kernel itself.
I believe that kern_mount() and kern_umount() are remnants from the time
when the binfmt_misc filesystem was mounted automatically by the kernel.  
Removing them preserves all functionality (I did check it) while allows
unloading binfmt_misc if and only if the binfmt_misc filesystem is not
used for any mounts.
Here's the patch against 2.4.18pre2.

P.S. Similar patch should probaly be applied to fs/devpts/inode.c as well.
