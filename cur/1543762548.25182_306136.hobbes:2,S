Andrew, I noticed that these were dropped out of 2.6.12-mm1:
> -sparsemem-base-teach-discontig-about-sparse-ranges.patch
> -sparsemem-base-simple-numa-remap-space-allocator.patch
> -sparsemem-base-reorganize-page-flags-bit-operations.patch
> -sparsemem-base-early_pfn_to_nid-works-before-sparse-is-initialized.patch
> 
> This was breaking compilation in various ways on various
> architectures.
> Returned to manufacturer.
I *think* those problems were caused by the actual sparsemem patches
that I posted for RFC, not the base "intro" patches.  (I have fixes for
the problems that you were hitting with the RFC patches ready, too)
I've run these through a bunch of compile tests, including arm and alpha
with and without DISCONTIGMEM, and they seem OK.  They also boot just
fine on a bunch of ppc64 and i386 configurations.  
Can these go back into -mm?
----
The following four patches provide the last needed changes before the
introduction of sparsemem.  For a more complete description of what this
will do, please see this patch:
http://www.sr71.net/patches/2.6.11/2.6.11-bk7-mhp1/broken-out/B-sparse-150-sparsemem.patch
or previous posts on the subject:

Three of these are i386-only, but one of them reorganizes the macros
used to manage the space in page->flags, and will affect all platforms.
There are analogous patches to the i386 ones for ppc64, ia64, and
x86_64, but those will be submitted by the normal arch maintainers.
The combination of the four patches has been test-booted on a variety of
i386 hardware, and compiled for ppc64, i386, and x86-64 with about 17
different .configs.  It's also been runtime-tested on ia64 configs (with
more patches on top).
