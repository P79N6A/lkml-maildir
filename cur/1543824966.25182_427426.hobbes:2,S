Hi.
Probably i have a stupid question but i can't find adequate solution for
it. I want to intercept write to real disk partition or entire disk
(except of swap partition of course). As i understood vfs and Co i think
that i need to work on level between fs driver and disk driver. But it's
unclean for me. Please tell me is it possible and if possible then say
how or put me to some documentation.
I need a offset from start or CHS value with buffer for save it.
