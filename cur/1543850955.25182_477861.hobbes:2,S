The swap file is not activated during the resume before the suspend image
is read from it.  That's why we need the number of the sector in which the
suspend image header is located.

Yes, it is.

If you need to compress the image during the suspend, please visit
eg. 
http://suspend.sf.net
 (it is recommended to use the latest CVS).
