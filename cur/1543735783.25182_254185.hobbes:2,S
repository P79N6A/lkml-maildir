As long as the userspace interfaces are only available to the root
filesystem, I'm not sure it's worth it to hide any of the methods.
It's added complexity, and in any case, root can do untold amounts of
damage by writing to /dev/mem, trying to upload firmware to IDE
drives, etc., etc., etc.
As you have pointed out, if there are bugs in the interpret, et. al,
it is better to expose them sooner rather than to stick our heads in
the sand and pretend they don't exist.
