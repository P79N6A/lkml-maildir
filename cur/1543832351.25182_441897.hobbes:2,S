Possibly, but not with the backtrace above.  You'd need an nfs server
backtrace to get the real sysfs inode.
In any case, the sock lock from the other backtrace that you had
(udp setsockopt) cannot be held by the kernel nfs client or server
since the kernel nfs sockets are not visible to user space.
