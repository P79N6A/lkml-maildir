I'm sorry, I don't understand the point you're making.
Andrew's proposal was that we could add early_uart_ioremap to the list of
bt_ioremap and dmi_ioremap.
I'm suggesting that maybe we should make bt_ioremap smart enough that
we could use it for early uart mapping.  And maybe we could get rid
of dmi_ioremap, and make DMI use bt_ioremap as well (this would require
some shims for x86_64 and ia64).
