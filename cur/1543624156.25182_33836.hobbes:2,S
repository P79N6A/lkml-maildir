I said WRITE6, not WRITE16. :-)  WRITE6 uses the low 5 bits of the LUN
byte for the top bits of the block number; WRITE10 and later use those
5 bits for DPO/FUA etc.  But WRITE6 is a horribly limited interface:
you only have 21 bits of block number for a start, so it's limited to
1GB on 512-byte-sector devices.  We can probably ignore WRITE6 safely
enough.
