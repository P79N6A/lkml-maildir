There's another nice advantage to the radix tree.
We can let oracle shared memory segments use 4 MB pages,
but still use the normal page cache code to look up the
pages.
With a radix tree there is no overhead in using different
page sizes since we'll just run into them in the tree.
(as opposed to the horrors of trying a hash lookup with
multiple page orders)

Rik
