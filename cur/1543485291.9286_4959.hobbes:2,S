I don't know about 2.2.1, but in 2.2.2-pre2, make modules does not depend on 
include/config/MARKER. This means that changing the config, then just
running make modules without make *Image doesn't regenerate the smartconfig
stuff - ie this problem occurs. Although nls may require some of the kernel to
be recompiled, not all the options do (eg joilet, win-95 bug fixes in smbfs, etc
). The fix is to make modules depend on include/config/MARKER like *Image does.
