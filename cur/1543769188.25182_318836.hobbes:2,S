It can also respond to loosing power during write by getting it's state
so mixed up the whole card is dead (it identifies but all sectors fail
to read).  The binary industrial grade CF cards (no longer in
production) had capacitors to be able to finish writing the block they
were doing to prevent problems.  Supposedly their new firmware now will
have a rollback system so that any partial write is just added back to
the free pool.  I had thought this was always how they did it, but no
apparently that is also something new.

We were told by SanDisk when we asked about a dead card (it had power
loss during a write) and was told that is normal for the regular
multicell flash cards.  They told us the firmware in the generation of
cards they are currently launching does not have a problem with that
anymore since it essentially journals the writes and can roll back a
partial block write.  I imagine they have patents on that too along with
lots of other flash technology.  Unfortunately their next generation
cards aren't -40 to +85C operation so although everything else was
perfect about them, they are of no use to us.

Well they seem to finally be getting those features working as people
have expected them to work.
