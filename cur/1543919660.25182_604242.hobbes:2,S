completion is a wrapper of workqueue and simpler to use.
my method:
1. In kthread:
do {
|_______|_______wait_for_completion(&ad7142_completion);
|_______|_______ad7142_decode();
|_______|_______enable_irq(CONFIG_BFIN_JOYSTICK_IRQ_PFX);
|_______} while (!kthread_should_stop());
2. In irq handler will fire "complete(&ad7142_completion);"
This is simpler and understand easier
