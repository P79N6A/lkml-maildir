Note: I'm just taking about the VM-xx patch from -aa, not some of the more
controversial patches in -aa.

Yep, make sense.  Though, keeping in mind the changes that are in -aa may
help when making changes to the buffer layer, and possibly less effort if a
problem is already fixed in -aa but not in 2.5.

It looks like most of the vm changes can just be dropped into 2.5 over a few
-pres.  Especially since few (none?) have argued that the -aa vm-patch
causes regressions.

Sounds interesting.

What about the recent threads on swapping in 2.5?
Merging the -aa vm-patch into 2.5 will allow people to develop on the best
known -aa VM to date, and can reduce duplicated effort.  Though, admittedly
it doesn't make much sense to do the same work on 2.4 and 2.5 at the same
time (vm patch merging).  Maybe it'll just be forward ported from 2.4...
