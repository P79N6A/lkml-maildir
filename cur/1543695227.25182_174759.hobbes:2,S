I looked at your logs, but I can't add much to what you already know.  
This certainly does appear to be some sort of interrupt sharing/routing
problem -- the logs don't indicate anything specific to USB.  However
there's no easy way to tell what the source of that problem is.
Maybe someone who knows more about ACPI and interrupt handling can help.
