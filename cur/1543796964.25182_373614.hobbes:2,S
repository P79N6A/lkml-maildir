Think about someone changing the VFS layer interface and fixing up all
the filesystems to accommodate that change.  That person is doing some
of your work for you, so you want to make it easy for him/her to find
your filesystem.  That's the sort of thing I was referring to as
maintenance.
As for changes on the cell-specific side, the people doing those
changes will know where to find it, so it isn't a problem having it in
fs/.
Having it in fs/ also means that it is more likely that people
familiar with VFS internals will look through your code and comment on
it.  I know that can be painful in the short term, but in the long
term it will lead to better code.
Paul.
