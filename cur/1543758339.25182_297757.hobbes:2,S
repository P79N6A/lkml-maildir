Hello,
I have a problem with the XFS-filesystem, I use the Kernel 2.6.10 and 
2.6.11-rc4 and rc5 everytime the same behavior.
I have a RAID 5(md0) with 3 disks on md0 (chunk-size 128) there is a 
logical volume (/dev/data/mp3-crypt) which is crypted with AES and the 
encrypted version ist under /dev/mapper/mp3, if the filestem on it is 
xfs and then copie some files on it then I get a kernel panic, mostly on 
greater files (>200MB), if I make the same thing with ext3 there is no 
problem. My first thougt was that the problem is that I make a snapshot 
of the device, but if i remove this it won't work anyway.
My sytem is a Pentium4 1800Mhz
512 MB SDRAM
I can't show you the kernel panic message, because I didn't found it in 
the syslog, it is only on the screen,
I'm not sure what infos you need too.
greetings
