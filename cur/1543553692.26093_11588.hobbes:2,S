Is it possible to access symbols exported by modules from inside the kernel ?
I put a funtion call inside the kernel code but this funtion must be implemented in a module. I tried export as a module symbol but when i tried to recompile the kernel.. :-(
Warning: implicit declaration of my_funtion
.
.
.
Error: Undefined reference to my_funtion.
How can i fix this mistake!????
Thanks in advance,
Cris Amon.
