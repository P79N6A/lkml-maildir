Umm... no.  I suspect you mean:
sr15 - first CDROM, fifteenth partition
sr16 - second CDROM, whole disk
sr17 - second CDROM, first partition
But what a bad idea for device names.  Why not
sr0 whole disc
sr0a ... sr0o partitions
sr1, sr1a ... sr1o
It's probably too late to be consistent with discs and call them
sra, sra1, ... sra15
srb, srb1, ... srb15

the nation that is attacked, and every man will be glad of those
conscience-soothing falsities, and will diligently study them, and refuse
to examine any refutations of them; and thus he will by and by convince 
himself that the war is just, and will thank God for the better sleep 
he enjoys after this process of grotesque self-deception." -- Mark Twain
