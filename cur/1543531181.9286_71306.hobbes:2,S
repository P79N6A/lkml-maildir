Ok, so as long as there is free swap, and the daemon is mlock()'ed, it
should have a chance of killing a rogue program. Fair enough.
But I still think that the OOM killer patch (with optional daemon to set
policy in user-space) is a good idea. The last time I checked (earlier
2.3.x) I could kill my system by running out of memory.
Most people probably don't want to run a daemon, and it makes sense to fix
the kernel, especially since the fix already exists for 2.2.x kernels...
Is that unreasonable?
