Apple's doing it right now.
Except that Apple keeps the old code open. Probably because
they'll gain nothing from it, and at best, they can appeal to
the techies.
And it worked. For months, I heard nothing but how much butt
MacOS X would kick and that it'd be like Linux, but have a
better application layer.
Whatever.
No one says that now that it's out. As if Apple would
really try to appeal to us. :)
