 You neglected to say what CPU type you compiled the kernel for.
 If it wasn't Pentium Pro maybe you could patch include/asm-i386/spinlock.h
line 82 (or the same place in x86-64) like this:
___
  * (PPro errata 66, 92)
  */
-#if !defined(CONFIG_X86_OOSTORE) && !defined(CONFIG_X86_PPRO_FENCE)
+#if 0
 #define __raw_spin_unlock_string \
         "movb $1,%0" \
___
The data might not make it out of the CPU write buffer without a locking
instruction doing the update.
