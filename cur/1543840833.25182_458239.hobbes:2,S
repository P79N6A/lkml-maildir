Yes, there is forensics, and there is the copying of data when
migrating a server to linux from some other OS. 
Perhaps I worry too much - I imagine salesmen claiming linux
support for their raid cards, because the int13 driver works. 
Just like they claim "linux support" with abominations like ndiswrapper.
The bad effects may be carefully hidden with "disk" tests that are
smaller than main memory in some huge-memory machine.
Then linux gets a bad reputation among ignorant purchasers,
performance went so much up with some other os .  . .
