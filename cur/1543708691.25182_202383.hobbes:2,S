Subject: 2.6.1: why auto power-off while on batteries?

Since I've upgraded my Fedora 1 distro to 2.6.1+swsusp, I've noticed 
that while on battery power (and only then), the laptop will auto 
poweroff after about 5 minutes of inactivity.  This does not appear 
to be a user-level acpid/whatever clean shutdown; the power is just 
cut without so much as a disk sync.  Of course there are no entries 
in /var/log/messages.
Any ideas anyone?
