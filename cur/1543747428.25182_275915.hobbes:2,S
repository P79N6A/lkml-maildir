another thing: could you try the latest jackd CVS tree too? I found
spurious xruns in 99-0 (the last official release), while with 99-11 i
dont see any xruns on my box, up until i completely saturate CPU time.
I.e. both latest -RT kernels are needed for this (earlier RT kernels,
prior the PI fixes still generated lots of xruns even with latest jack
CVS), and latest jack CVS is needed.
