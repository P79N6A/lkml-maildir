Hello,
	I have kernel 2.4.0-test5 with a tulip multi-port card. The drive is
there and dmesg is showing all ports detected. Whenever I run ifconfig the
second interface that I try to bring up locks the box. This card currently
works under 2.2.14. I don't believe that it is the card I think that it has
something to do with the shared interrupts. Has anyone else experienced this
and if so is there a solution?
Thanks,
Syd
