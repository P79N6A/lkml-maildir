From memory my brand new SB16 PnP which has the Vibra chip on it
doesn't have the address lines D8-D15 on the second bit of the AT slot
making it physically impossible to do 16 bit transfers. It will still play
16 bit sound however which is an entirely different bucket of fish.
Have a close look at the AT/ISA extension part of the card and I think
you'll find there are only a few control lines used (probably the extra IRQs).
