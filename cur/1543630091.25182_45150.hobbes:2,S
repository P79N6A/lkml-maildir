You are right, its not that I want to ignore it. The problem was that I
want to handle it some way but I dont know how. If I will make a user
handler for it how can I know if its a SIGBUS from a HW error or a SIGBUS
from that write()-case. Because I have to continue serving files even
after received a SIGBUS in that write (otherwise my file server will exit
with SIGBUS and thats no good :) ).
Take for example any single process ftp/http server, they are hit by this
problem. Which solution would you recommend ? :)
