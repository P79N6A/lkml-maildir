I was going to double-check this morning.. but don't see where
current->comm is copied into a new task_struct.  I thought that all
processes within the group had the same current->comm value, so figure
this is OK.

no idea..

The checks blocking flow into do_group_exit, like (regs->tstate &
TSTATE_PRIV) for sparc64, or (user_mode(regs)) for powerpc, do vary
across the arch's.    The code could be rearranged to have a helper
containing just the printk and the do_group_exit() call; but I'm not
sure that would be an improvement. 
maybe a    do_group_sigkill_if(condition); helper    :-)
