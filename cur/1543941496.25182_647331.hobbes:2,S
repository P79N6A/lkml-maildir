another thing: these inlines are a bit fat and they are used in more 
than one place. Please move them into pgtable.c. The rule of thumb is: 
if an inline is more than 2 lines big, it is a likely candidate for 
uninlining. (and even many 2-liners, and even some 1-liners are 
candidates) Especially under paravirt the MMU inlines grow these update 
notifiers so they become even fatter.
having functions instead of inlines also simplifies the type 
dependencies by quite a degree.
