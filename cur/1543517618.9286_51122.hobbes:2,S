It's not too difficult, but it depends a bit if it is a fixed frequency or
a multi frequency monitor. It also depends a bit on you, of course ;-).
Have a look at Marc Joosen's page:
  
http://historia.et.tudelft.nl/~marcj/fixed_freq/
Marc also managed to connect a 20" Silicon Graphics monitor to his PC, but
that's not yet on his page.

That's a 13W3 connector. Kind of hard to get, so try to get the original
monitor cable with it and cut that to pieces or mount 5 BNC connectors on
the back of the monitor rewire R, G, B, Hsync and Vsync.
