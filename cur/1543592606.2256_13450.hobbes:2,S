Cross compiling kernel (any recent version) on any non-64bit host (ie:
x86) to 
ALPHA the "make bootpfile" step fails. The problem is localized 
to arch/alpha/boot/tools/objstrip.c
Various 'elf' structure members are 64 bit, not 32bit and the wrong
version of
the structure is being choosen. (To bad you can't use the binutils
library here!)
I have hand coded around this, and can easily produce bootp files.
I would like to submit patches but my change/hack is not real pretty.
There are other issues associated with cross compiling this file, who is
an 
appropriate person reguarding alpha specific items such as these?
