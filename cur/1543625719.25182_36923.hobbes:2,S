Untrue.  See
	
http://www.kroah.com/linux/hotplug/ols_2001_hotplug_talk/html/mgp00014.html
for a 6 line version of /sbin/hotplug that always assigns the same
"ethX" value to the same MAC address.  I think the patch to nameif has
gone in to support this, but I'm not sure.
And why is there a limitation of only 8 devices?  Why not do what all
USB drivers do, and just create the structure that you need to use at
probe() time, and destroy it at remove() time?
Just my $0.02
