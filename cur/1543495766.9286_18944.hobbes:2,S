 This is to announce that version 1.1c of DIPC (Distributed Inter-Process
Communication) for Linux is available now. It patches 2.2.8/2.3.0 kernels.
 DIPC can be used to build and program clusters (multi-computers), and provides
distributed program developers with semaphores, messages and transparent 
distributed shared memory.
 The file dipc-1.1c.tgz, containing the complete source code and documents, 
can be obtained by anomymous FTP from wallybox.cei.net, in directory
/pub/dipc. 
 Alternatively, it can be downloaded from sunsite.unc.edu, in /incoming/Linux, 
or in /pub/Linux/system/network/distrib.

                making System V IPC mechanisms (shared memories, 
                semaphores and messages) network transparent.
