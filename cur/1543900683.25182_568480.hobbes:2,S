If the #error can trigger, the Kconfig is broken, yes?  (No action is
required though - it's always good to have checks)

include/linux/compiler*.h'.

Perhaps a reference to where that bug number came from?

I suppose if we made this const, something would blow up.
There is no power management support in this driver.
