sg3_utils is a package of command line utilities for sending
SCSI (and some ATA) commands to devices. This package targets
the lk 2.6 and lk 2.4 series. In the lk 2.6 series these
utilities (except sgp_dd) can be used with any devices that
support the SG_IO ioctl.
This version improves support for ATA(PI) devices in the sg_inq
utility. For example, assuming /dev/hdc is an ATAPI DVD drive,
"sg_inq /dev/hdc" shows the response to a SCSI INQUIRY command,
while "sg_inq -A /dev/hdc" shows the response to an ATA IDENTIFY
PACKET DEVICE command. See CHANGELOG for more information.
A tarball, rpm and deb can be found on (see table 2):
