No.  Use separate set of hooks AND PASS vfsmount DIRECTLY TO THEM.  Damnit,
people, just how many times does it have to be repeated?
Any version that pulls that class of tricks is no-go.  I don't _CARE_ whether
you hide vfsmount in task struct, do the same with string, send yourself a
datagram over magic socket or mail it to kludges-R-US.webtv.com, downloading
it back in LSM hook.
It's not a problem with implementation; it's a problem with the kludge
itself *and* with having the effect of vfs_mkdir() et.al. dependent on
anything except the arguments it's getting.
Adding global context of that kind is every bit as wrong as passing vfsmount
(or absolute pathname, or...) to vfs_mkdir() and its ilk.  It's worse,
actually, since it has an extra helping of ugliness on top of doing the
wrong thing.
