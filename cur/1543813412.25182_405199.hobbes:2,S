I found something strange although I don't know why it happens yet:
  Fedora Core 4 kernel (2.6.15 + patches) works fine.
  Fedora Core 4 kernel + -rt21, [ahem... sorry], works fine.
  Fedora Core 4 kernel + -rt21 + alsa kernel modules from 1.0.10 or
     1.0.11rc3, fails[*]
  Plain vanilla 2.6.15 + -rt21, works fine
  Plain vanilla 2.6.15 + -rt21 + alsa kernel modules from 1.0.10 or
     1.0.11rc3, fails[*]
So, it looks like it is some weird interaction between kernel modules
that were not compiled as part of the kernel and the kernel itself. The
"updated" modules are installed in a separate location (not on top of
the built in kernel modules) and are found before the ones in the kernel
tree.
I have been building this combination for a long long time with no
problems, I don't know what might have happened that changed things.
Could be:
- configuration problems?
- the alsa tree is somehow incompatible with the kernel alsa tree, is
  that even possible?
I have _no_ idea on what to start looking for... but, oh well, this is a
start. Suggestions welcome. Thanks for somehow pointing me in the right
direction.

[*] I need that because of cards not yet included in the kernel proper,
and fixes that have not yet percolated to the kernel alsa tree.
