But 'fuck' 'shit' etc. aren't blasphemous. 
What we should _really_ be doing is removing all occurrences of words such as:
'God', 'Gosh', 'Golly', 'Cor',
'Cor Blimey'  (apparently derived from 'Lord blind me'
... which _are_ blasphemous. To pick a religion at random, I know of nothing 
in the Bible which suggests that one shouldn't refer to natural bodily 
functions, but it clearly states that one shouldn't take the name of the Lord 
in vain.
The Bible even implies that to be ashamed of bodily functions/parts is a sign 
of evil, as Adam and Eve only started to care about such things after eating 
the Apple. 
So surely if we _really_ want to be 'pure' we should aim to return to their
original state - to stop being so idiotic about natural bodily functions, and
stamp out blasphemy instead?
I therefore propose that the entire kernel source be passed through 
s/gosh/fuckme/ and similar filters.
