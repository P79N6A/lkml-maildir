Ingo,
With Mingming's patch to resolve the ext3 allocate-with-reservation
latency, it looks like we are finally getting close to the lower limit
that can be achieved with PREEMPT_DESKTOP.  I've attached the trace of
the lowest latency over several days of testing with
2.6.12-rc3-RT-V0.7.46-02 + Mingming's patch.  It's only 127 usecs, and
IIRC you mentioned previously that this code path can't be made
preemptible in !PREEMPT_RT.
Since Mingming's patch will have to live in -mm for a while, can it be
added to the RT patchset as well?
