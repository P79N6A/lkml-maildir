	What kind of work is this?  If it's pretty simple stuff, just repetitive,
I may be able to help out.  Got an example of before/after?  Or at least let me
know of a driver that has been 'properly' updated so I have something to work
from?  I'll try and look at some of the code, I'm pretty good at C, but not too
terribly familiar w/ kernel internals (yet. :) ).
