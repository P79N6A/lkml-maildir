	Right. On similar lines I believe we need to split 
firmware/efi/systab as well.

	I did not hear whether the idea of updating efi memory map on a 
hotplug is good or bad. In any case, can somebody tell me to how do 
I get the available physical range map (only the ranges that VM is 
using at a given point in time) from userland. I believe I outlined 
a legitimate requirement earlier in this thread :-)
Thanks
