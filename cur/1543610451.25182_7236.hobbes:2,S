Subject: bttv module intialization takes much time on kernel-2.4.x

Title says it all.  I use bttv module.   When invoking "modprobe bttv" it 
takes several minutes to initialize.  When I used kernel-2.2.x it was very 
quick, but with kernel-2.4.x it takes a while.   But after that, it works 
fine.
   I don't know why.  Any solutions??  or am I doing anything wrong?
For your reference, I use BT878 based card, kernel-2.4.15-pre8 for now and 
dmesg gives these messages:
