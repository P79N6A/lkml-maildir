No, the utf8 support of vfat is wrong. This is implementation
thing, and it is not recommended until it is fixed.

I'm talking about two filesystems on a system here, not two encoding
on one filesystem. You can change locale on each filesystems, or each
directory, of course if it's not vfat.
It's wrong? May or may not be true. It's the user policy.
