The lid switch event is probably reported via ACPI.  But the
fact that you see your "LID switch" message from /etc/acpi/acpi_handler.sh
means the switch event is getting through.
What else does the acpi_handler.sh script do?  Can you add more
log messages in it and any related scripts?
If all else fails, you could try git-bisect to isolate a changeset
that broke it.  That's tedious but usually effective.
