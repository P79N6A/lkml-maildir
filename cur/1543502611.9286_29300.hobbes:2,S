I am writing Fibre Channel SCSI HBA Linux driver and currently stopped at
the device detect phase.  The driver is loaded with "insmod" command and
card (HBA) initialization phase is passed.  
Now the OS has sent first scsi command down which is Test Unit Ready to the
device.  The command is completed with good status.  After driver processed
the finished command and called "done" callback routine, OS seems to be
staying there and not sending any more command down.  The system is hung.
Only way to get the system alive is to power off it.  At this moment, no HBA
driver HBA driver routine is being called.  
The system has shown driver is being detected and "scsi: 1 host" is
displayed.
I don't have kdb yet and have some difficulty to install it now.  
Need light on what seems to be the problem how to debug it!!!
Many thanks!
