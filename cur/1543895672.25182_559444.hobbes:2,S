There were some ideas, i will try to summarize:
* New Patches (or sets) need tracking, review, testing
  Zero (tracking) done by sending (To, or bcc) [RFC] patch to something
  like submit@pts.e-mail.example.com (like BTS now). Notifications will
  be sent to intrested maintainers (if meta-information is ok) or testers
  (see below)
  First is mostly done by maintainers or interested individuals.
  Result is "Acked-by" and "Cc" entries in the next patch sent. Due to
  lack of tracking this things are done manually, are generally in
  trusted manner. But bad like <200706172053.41806.bzolnier@gmail.com>
  sometimes happens.
  When patch in sent to this PTS, your lovely
  checkpatch/check-whatever-crap-has-being-sent tools can be set up as
  gatekeepers, thus making impossible stupid errors with MIME coding,
  line wrapping, whatever style you've came up with now in checking
  sent crap.
* Tracking results of review (Acked-by).
  This can be mostly e-mail exchange with comments and agreements.
  "Acked-by" semantic may be implemented in form of contlol message to
  tracking system, and this system will generate e-mail confirmation
  to the patch author in form of
  "Acked-by: Developer's Name <message-id of e-mail with acke-by>"
  Thus, next patch will have this entry. And if testing of this
  version ir regression happens, there's info about who is/was
  interested/involved.
* Testing.
  Mainly same for "Tested-by"
  (newly suggested by Stefan <4675C083.6080409@s5r6.in-berlin.de>)
|-*- Feature Needed -*-
  Addition, needed is hardware user tested have/had/used. Currently
  ``reportbug'' tool includes packed specific and system specific
  additions automaticly gathered and inserted to e-mail sent to BTS.
  (e.g. <
http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.linux.debian.devel.kernel/29740>
)
  Formats of that hardware profile(as system information in reportbug)
  . arch
  . chipset
  . hdd
  . vga
  ...
  in meaningful fields, and not just lspci -v[vv]. If additional info
  (-vvv) or something required, profile can be exteded.
  For kernel's sub-system information(as packed info):
  . subsystem/driver/kernel version (or similar)
  . maintainers must know what they need to see more here
|-*- back to patches -*-
  Last and not least tast cases, that everyone might came up with.
  All formats this can be agreed (or implemented and updated latter)
  and inserted automaticly.
* Commit.
  Id is recorded, patch archived. But any additions are welcome,
  regressions will pop up this patch again (reopen in BTS).

Experienced BTS users and developers. Please, correct me if i'm wrong.
At least e-mail part of Debian's BTS and whole idea of it is *exactly*
what is needed. Bugzilla fans, you can still use you useless pet,
because Debian developers have done things, to track and e-mail states
of bugs: <

I wish perl hackers out there will join this yet-new effort. I know
there many of them out there, writing kilobytes of checkfile and
checkpatch (i've wrote in few lines of ``sed'').
BTS is written on perl, but any interoperability interface, like
stdin/stdout for python or shell hackers is worth of thinking about.
Please, see more and make useful follows ups: 
http://bugs.debian.org/
Please, do not (<46772321.9080602@mbligh.org>)
""" I know you hate bugzilla ... but at least I can try to make that bit
    of the process work better.

Thanks.
