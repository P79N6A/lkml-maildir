Hi Alan, Marek.

One simple fix I've seen (and used myself on occasion) is to do the
following in a bash CGI script - this was to generate a number in the
range 1 to 75:
 Q> SEED=`date "+75%S $PID*75%%p" | dc`
Whilst the individual components may be simple to guess, the result
usually isn't.
Best wishes from Riley.
