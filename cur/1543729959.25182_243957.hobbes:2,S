The compilation phase seems to stress a whole bunch of stuff, primarily
the VM and scheduler, and a little on the VFS. Saying that things are 
"too parallizable" to stress things is odd - that seems to cause more
stress, not less.

The benchmark is perfectly stable on one machine as long as the user
has some vague grip on the enviroment, and isn't running debian unstable
and auto-updating every night. Benchmarking across arches has always been
done with a target of i386 when Anton and I have done it, and no, it 
doesn't serve much purpose apart from a fun pissing contest. However,
benchmarking different kernels with the same userspace setup on one
machine is perfectly valid, and very useful.

Altering userspace is of course going to change the result - but has 
absolutely no relevance whatsoever to whether this is a useful benchmark
or not. 
The point is not to compile the kernel - the point is to get a vaguely
realistic simulation of something a user might do to stress the kernel
in interesting ways. At which I think kernbench does reasonably well.
No, it's not perfect, but it's simple, and it's useful - it's led to
many useful improvements already, and no doubt will continue to do so.
All benchmarks are crap. Some are just less crap than others.
