I think we are agreeing on this, I was responding to your question of if 
we could get away to limiting things to one bus at a time.

makeing up an example
today the process would be
call driver X to initialize it's devices.
driver X follows these steps
1. see if a compatible chipset/device appears to be available
2. initialize the chipset/device (loading firmware)
3. query the now partially initialized chipset/device to see what specific 
options are enabled in the hardware
4. for each 'thing' that's enabled in hardware, initialize and register 
it.
step 2 can take a long time and so you want it to be async so that it's 
timeouts can be running in parallel (for that matter step 1 may have some 
timeouts as well)
however, you can't tell what devices to register until after step 3
so in at least some cases, it seems as if the registratin of devices needs 
to be after the async section.
Linus made a good case fo an example (hard drives) where the registration 
can happen first and fast, but the async section (spinning up) takes a 
while and could come second.
to acommodate both of these device models it seems to me that you can't 
defice either
async followed by sync
or
sync followed by async
but instead need to support the combined
sync followed by async followed by sync.
now, it's very possible that I'm mistaken and one of the two-part models 
can be used for everything, if so then it's definantly simpler to do so.
