Oh yes, but the *expensive* part of the machine -- the multiprocessor 
box -- isn't.
Also, when using massmarket systems of more than 2 or 3 monitors you 
start having cabling problems.  VGA connectors aren't impedance matched 
and cause nasty reflections at high resolutions, so they don't extend 
well.  I guess digital video is coming, but is not yet mass market.
