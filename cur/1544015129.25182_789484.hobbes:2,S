| Hi,
| 
| here is a series of RFC in attempt to implement
| net-namespaces for PPP protocol (including PPPoE
| and PPPoL2TP).
| 
| I would really appreciate _any_ kind of comments.
| Really doubt if there is no bugs in my implementation
| but it's RFC after all. Mostly -compile- tested so it
| requires strong review. One more time -- I would admire
| any kind of comments (even like -- it's completely broken
| and full of sh*t would be fine -- but with details please :).
