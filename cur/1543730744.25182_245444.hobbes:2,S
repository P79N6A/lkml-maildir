Presumably the app which uses the metadata will be smart enough to
compare the st_mtime of the MDS/stream/attribute/whatever (can we choose
a name for these things now?) to the st_mtime of the file and do the
right thing.
thumbnail - regenerate it
summary - keep it, it's relatively independent of the file's exact
contents
signature - always verify it
etc.
