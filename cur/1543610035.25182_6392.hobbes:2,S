Well I don't know how RT sematics apply to SMP systems.
The easy solution ( == big common lock ) would be to have a single RT
queue that is checked before the private one.
Anyway, sometime it happens that the cure is worst than the disease and to
solve a corner case you're going to punish common case performances (
Linux is not an RT OS even with that fix ).
