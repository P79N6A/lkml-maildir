I got this error on booting up 2.3.11-1  (which comes from
__kmem_cache_alloc when called with a NULL kmem_cache_t *cachep,
who could have been called from kmem_cache_alloc or kmalloc).
Behavior otherwise since boot has been totally normal (although it
seems a bit sluggish compared to 2.3.10, that is only a subjective
opinion.)
It just finished compiling the kernel while running as an Xterminal
with /usr nfs exported from another computer, and no further messages
have occured:

If there is additional information needed, or anyone has any
suggestions on stresses to try to create a more "definitive" bug
report, please let me know.  (The <box> is expendable :-)
