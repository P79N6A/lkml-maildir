On x86_64 the quicklists partially replace the role of the mmu_gather
list because we would otherwise create more overhead by having to move
pages between the mmu gather and the quicklists lists.
lists.
The final flush does only check if there are too many pages on the
quicklists. Otherwise the quicklist is not dumped/freed (unlike the
mmu_gather list) but kept for the following page table page allocations
since we have cache hot cpu objects there.
The only problem is that we cannot release any pages before the TLB flush 
has happened. The optimization of releasing off node pages in order to 
keep only node local pages is therefore not valid.
