Good point ..read_lock() will probably suffice in update_nodemask which
means we don't need the patch I sent earlier.
Paul (Jackson),
	This made me see another race in update_nodemask vs fork:
Lets say cpuset CS1 has only one task T1 to begin with.
update_nodemask(CS1)			T1 in do_fork()
	CPU0				     CPU1
=============================================================
					cpuset_fork();
					mpol_copy();
ntasks = atomic_read(&cs->count);
[ntasks = 2, accounting new born child T2]
cs->mems_allowed = something;
set_cpuset_being_rebound()
write/read_lock(tasklist_lock);
do_each_thread {
	/* Finds only T1 */
	mmarray[] = ..
} while_each_thread();
write/read_unlock(tasklist_lock);
					write_lock(tasklist_lock);
					/* Add T2, child of T1 to tasklist */
					write_unlock(tasklist_lock);
for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
	mpol_rebind_mm(..);
}
In this for loop, we migrate only T1's ->mm. T2's->mm isn't migrated
AFAICS.
Is that fine?
