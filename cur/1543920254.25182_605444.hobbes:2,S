This is fixed in any release based on 2.6.16.31 or later.
The relevant mainline patch is 
    1a047060a99f274a7c52cfea8159e4142a14b8a7
as below.
So update your kernel package.

    [PATCH] knfsd: fix race that can disable NFS server
    This patch is suitable for just about any 2.6 kernel.  It should go in
    2.6.19 and 2.6.18.2 and possible even the .17 and .16 stable series.
    This is a long standing bug that seems to have only recently become
    apparent, presumably due to increasing use of NFS over TCP - many
    distros seem to be making it the default.
    The SK_CONN bit gets set when a listening socket may be ready
    for an accept, just as SK_DATA is set when data may be available.
    It is entirely possible for svc_tcp_accept to be called with neither
    of these set.  It doesn't happen often but there is a small race in
    svc_sock_enqueue as SK_CONN and SK_DATA are tested outside the
    spin_lock.  They could be cleared immediately after the test and
    before the lock is gained.
    This normally shouldn't be a problem.  The sockets are non-blocking so
    trying to read() or accept() when ther is nothing to do is not a problem.
    However: svc_tcp_recvfrom makes the decision "Should I accept() or
    should I read()" based on whether SK_CONN is set or not.  This usually
    works but is not safe.  The decision should be based on whether it is
    a TCP_LISTEN socket or a TCP_CONNECTED socket.
