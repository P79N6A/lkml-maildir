Every vendor of products for Microsoft Windows (which is still the
primary market for all their hardware) has to provide drivers or work
with pre-existing drivers. The harder Microsoft makes it (in financial
terms) for them to produce drivers the more incentive they have to use
the existing standards or to create new ones.
