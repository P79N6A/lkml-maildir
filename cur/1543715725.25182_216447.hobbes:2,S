Thanks for your help and sorry for asking the Redhat question here...
I will tried out the solutions you provided today later.
However, I would like to ask one more question about compiling kernel ( 
I sure this is about the kernel this time.)
The following is what I does to recompile my kernel, I run these command 
at /usr/src/linux-2.4/
 # make mrproper
 # cd /usr/src/linux-2.4/configs
 # cp kernel-2.4.18-ia64-smp.config  /usr/src/linux-2.4/.config
 # make oldconfig
 # make dep
 # make compressed
 # make modules
 # make modules_install
 # make install 
All the steps went good but when it comes to "make install", the error 
happened
    make: *** No rule to make target `install'.  Stop.
Does that means I dont have the any code in the "Makefile" for "make 
install"? And does that means my Makefile is not correct?
I have looked into the web and some documents said make install will 
copy the kernel file to correct directory and make a new entry into 
elilo.conf.
Based on this, could I manually do the following instead of relying on 
the "make install" command?
1. copy the kernel files (vmlinux.gz and System.map) to 
/boot/efi/efi/redhat/
2. make symbolic link to above file at /boot
3. edit elilo.conf to add a new entry pointing to the new kernel compiled.
4. Restart.
Could anyone provide opinions on it?
Thanks again.
