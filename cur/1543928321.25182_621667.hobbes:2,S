Might the recent discussion on the exporting of sys_open() and
sys_read() be an example here?  There would appear to be a consensus
that people should not have used those functions, but they are now
proving difficult to unexport.
Perhaps the best use of the namespace stuff might be for *future*
exports which are needed to help make the mainline kernel fully modular,
but which are not meant to be part of a more widely-used API?
