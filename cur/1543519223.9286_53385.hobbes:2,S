Yep, yesterday night I came to that conclusion too after compiling
2.3.32pre4 as Pentium with TSC, not i686 (that configuration worked fine on
my plain Pentium). It seems to work (must check later), and comparing the
CFLAGS with the 2.2.14pre's (which use -m486, AFAIR). Compiler bug? Weird,
as the same problems have shown up with several compiler versions. And to
find out if the bug bites me is quite costly, so...
I'll still need a simple test case that shows the problem. And some
time. Got some to spare?  ;-)

Currently egcs-1.1.2-24 from RehHat 6.1, but I've also used gcc-2.95.2 and
several gcc snapshots. Never had trouble with them on my plain Pentium...

Neither alternative sounds too appetizing, to tell the truth.
Thanks!
