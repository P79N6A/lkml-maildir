If you do this, please consider allowing a block size up to 64KB.
The ia64 kernel offers a choice of 4, 8, 16, and 64KB page size.

ia64 linux normally uses > 4KB.  The recommended page size at the
moment is 16KB.  I didn't think 64KB would become realistic for quite
some time, but performance is surprisingly good, even on today's
systems.
