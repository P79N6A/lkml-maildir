Hi,
my Software Raid 0 (md) doesn't work any more. mdadd (Debian, V 0.35) reports
i21pc2:~# mdadd -a
/dev/sdb2: No such device
/dev/sda3: No such device
with a mdtab like
/dev/md0        raid0,8k,0,7addcad1     /dev/sdb2 /dev/sda3 
In Kernel-version 2.9 everything worked fine.
What can I do to fix it? 
German.
