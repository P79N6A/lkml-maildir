For initializing it is still the safest!
I can only repeat myself: Graphic chipsets have so many
parameters for memory size, memory layout, memory timings
on notebooks: voltages, display properties bus types and
whatever you can think of. 
Please tell me how you want to probe all that!!
Do you expect the user to hack all these parameters into
a configuration file? When the user doesn't even know 
what chipset is on his board? - if he has done something 
wrong he might fry his card or his LCD (notebooks).
Egbert.
