Will do. I'm learning the process. I assume Linus's latest tree is the
one
listed as the latest prepatch for the stable Linux kernel tree.

Agreed. Although the current kernel source doesn't document these
attributes, there's no reason I couldn't add documentation for them.

The state is protected by the spinlock in __printk_ratelimit, like it is
in
the current kernel. Am I missing something?
