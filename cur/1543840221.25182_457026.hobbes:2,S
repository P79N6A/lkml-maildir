Thanks for the patch.  I had a patch to fix this in my queue, but I
just hadn't got around to submitting it yet :-(
Never mind, we'll go with yours and Andrew already has it.
I had flags the fh_lock in nfsd_setattr a I_MUTEX_CHILD which you
didn't however I see that isn't needed (Why do we have PARENT and
CHILD and NORMAL.... you would think that any two would do ??)
However there is a bit missing: the fh_lock in nfsd_proc_create
in nfsproc.c needs I_MUTEX_PARENT - I'll send a separate patch to fix
that.
Thanks,
NeilBrown
