Not anywhere near that simple. Having exceptions anywhere in the kernel
would require protecting basically every critical section with exception
handling (much worse than the current small number of spinlocks) to avoid
leaving data/hardware/spinlocks in an inconsistent state when a function
unexpectedly decides to throw an exception and unroll the stack before the
caller's had a chance to reenable interrupts, clean up dangling pointers,
etc... Bug tracking nightmare, not to mention major code bloat. Better off
oopsing. You don't have this problem in C, because it's safe to assume
that functions WILL return to the caller.. Exceptions are not your friend.
