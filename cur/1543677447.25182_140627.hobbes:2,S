For RedHat users, there's another pitfall in "/etc/rc.sysinit". During
startup, the script sets up the binary used to dynamically load modules
stored at "/proc/sys/kernel/modprobe". The initscript looks for
"/proc/ksyms" (if my memory servers me well), but since it doesn't exist
in 2.5 kernels, the binary used is "/sbin/true" instead.
This, eventually, will keep modules from working. RedHat users will have
to patch the "/etc/rc.sysinit" script to set "/proc/sys/kernel/modprobe"
to "/sbin/modprobe", even when "/proc/ksyms" doesn't exist.
I can't attach a patch. All my RH9 boxes are manually patched and can't
get access to the original "/etc/rc.sysinit" script :-(
