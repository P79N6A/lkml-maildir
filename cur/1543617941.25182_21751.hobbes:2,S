Since it looks like it is going to take some time to resolve the
wiring problem affecting kernel.org, I have put the kernel.org system
in "mirrors only mode."  This means mirror sites can update, but no
user traffic is allowed -- except obtaining the list of mirrors.
This wiring problem is an unfortunate consequence of having had to
push the new kernel.org server into service on a lot shorter notice
than expected back in December.  Once we can get it resolved these
kinds of problems should hopefully not recur.
