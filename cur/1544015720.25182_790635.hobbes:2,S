Thanks for this. But I think we also need the following:
--- drivers/block/nbd.c        2008-12-24 18:26:37.000000000 -0500
+++ drivers/block/nbd.c 2009-01-12 08:50:17.000000000 -0500
@@ -406,6 +406,7 @@ static int nbd_do_it(struct nbd_device *
         ret = sysfs_create_file(&disk_to_dev(lo->disk)->kobj, 
&pid_attr.attr);
         if (ret) {
                 printk(KERN_ERR "nbd: sysfs_create_file failed!");
+               lo->pid = 0;
                 return ret;
         }
To zero out pid in the error case. Otherwise, it looks good.
Thanks,
Paul
