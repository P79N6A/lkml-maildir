Subject: [PATCH 10/10] uml: replace printk with "stack-friendly" printf - to report console failure
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/9/21/171

From: Paolo 'Blaisorblade' Giarrusso <blaisorblade@yahoo.it>
User get *a lot* confused when consoles don't work but we don't report anything.
And, as reported in the comment, using printk to report "your console doesn't
work" isn't likely to go that far.
Fix the problem on the base of this: stack consumption by host printf(). Use
kernel sprintf() and os_write_file, using a wild guess that one page will be
enough for the message, to preallocate the buffer with kmalloc().
