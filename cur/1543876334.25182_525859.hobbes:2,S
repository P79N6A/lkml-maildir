Hello,
Tested and working on Kontron JREX-PM.
fairly straightforward backport of w83627hf_wdt.c from 2.6.20.1
Changes from 2.6 version
Default timeout set to 120 seconds
Nonstandard read only proc interface (/proc/watchdog)
Always reset timer on driver load
Changed timeout limit to 255
Ignores failure to acquire IO port
Caveats:
Ignores failure to acquire IO port since it is always taken, there's
probably a better way around that.
Releases IO port regardless of having acquired it.
