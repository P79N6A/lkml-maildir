I think "no translation" should still be around if people want to handle
it entirely from userland no ?
That is:
 - no translation : nothing special is done, Fx sends Fx keycode
regardless of Fn key, Fn key itsef sends a keycode for itself, there is
no emulation of numlock
 - fnkeyfirst / fnkeylast : Either Fx is translated and Fn-Fx is not or
the opposite. Numlock emulation is enabled.

Yah, forget it, I was on crack.
