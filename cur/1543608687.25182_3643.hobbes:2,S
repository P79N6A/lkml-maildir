The patch is without problem on 2.4.13-ac7.  Free memory increased by
about 100K: free and dmesg both confirm 384292k vs 384196k.  This is a
P3-733 on an i815 with 384MB.  Very nice.
Note that the patch and UP-APIC do not get along.  Some quick debugging
with William found the cause.  APIC does indeed touch bootmem.  The
above is thus obviously with CONFIG_X86_UP_APIC unset.
