	In that case, even CFS would work.  If a normal user mounts his
encrypted directory, even root can't read it without hacking the CFS binary
or pawing through kmem.  Matt Blaze mentions some of this in his
documentation on CFS that you can't stop a determined root user but
a root user would still have to hack into it.  It won't happen by browsing
or by accident.
