We've just switched to redrawing by default, rather than memmoving.
Things are much, much faster on PCs now.  I'll post an announcement of
a new version as soon as I can get it uploaded.

My understanding is that's certainly true for performance, but not memory
usage and code size/complexity.  My board only has 2MB.
I'm sure I'm making lots of mistakes that have been made before, but
that's okay - I'm learning lots from doing it.  This is a project I've
wanted to do for ages, and I quit my job so I could spend time on it.
And I really do think we can build something smaller, simpler and faster
than nanogui.  We'll see.

Also fixed in the new version, the clipping algorithm now uses a stack
structure allocated with kmalloc.  Thanks to everyone who provided advice
on this.  I now understand very clearly why a dynamically growing stack
area would make dealing with races awful tough.  :)
Cheers,
