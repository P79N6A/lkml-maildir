It sometimes takes me half a day to get onto looking at patches.  And if I
take them I usually don't reply (sorry).  But I don't drop stuff, so if you
don't hear, please assume the patch stuck.  If others raise objections
to the patch I'll usually duck it as well, but it's pretty obvious when that
happens.
I really should knock up a script to send out an email when I add a patch
to -mm.

I'm rather aghast at all the ifdeffery and complexity in this one.  But I
haven't looked at it closely yet.
