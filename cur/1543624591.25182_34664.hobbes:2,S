Dear all
In brief: a kernel module which "exported" VFS requests to a (specified) 
user-space daemon would be useful. My particular application is a daemon 
which generates files on the fly - I would like to expose this as part of the 
filesystem. Ideally, the kernel module would deal with generation of fake 
inode numbers etc and the user-space daemon would simply be asked to create a 
pipe corresponding to a "filename" and (possibly) supply a directory tree. 
Clearly, an application-specific module could do the job - cf NFS. But I am 
not (yet) skilled enough in kernel development to know how, and it seems to 
me that a "VFS mediator" module could simplify development of many 
VFS-related applications (eg mounting ftp sites). Is there a kind soul out 
there who has already done this, or is willing to undertake such a task? 
Thanks for any input
Jonathan
