Hi Linus, Alan, all,
Is the BCM4400 network driver planned for 2.4.22? It is in 2.4.22-pre3-ac1, 
but not in 2.4.22-pre3.
As far as I can tell, it works fine. If needed, I can do some more testing.
I hope it can be included in the mainstream 2.4. It saves me (and a lot of 
other people) the trouble of using an external driver.
Regards,
Bas.
(Dell Inspiron 8500 with 2.4.22-pre3)
