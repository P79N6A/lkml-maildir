I have been using a Dell SMB dual PII/300 box with cs4232 playing my
MP3s
in a loop 24x7 for nearly a year without any glitches.  I have tried it
with 2.2 kernels and 2.4.0.  
The only problem I have had with the box and sound driver was that I 
had to set the PCI quirks flag to 1 (thanks to Alan for pointing me to
it)
to keep it from crashing when playing sound and accessing the floppy 
(this got QUITE embarassing when I was doing some custom work for some 
high-level folks a while back).
However, I have one beef with the driver.  Each time it starts a cut,
I get a loud pop from the speaker.  This appears to be a startup
transient and is not present on my other sound card in the box,
a SoundBlaster Vibra 16.  This pop happens on ANY play application,
playing ANY file (esdplay, play[sox], vplay, xmms, etc.).
Cheers,
