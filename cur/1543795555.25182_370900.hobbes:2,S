Hi,
 Thanks a lot for the reply to my previous problem. Sincerely appreciated.
Now, here is another quickie. I am running inside the kernel. I have a
"page" pointer. I am trying to access the page contents. How can I do
it if the page is not really in my address space? (e.g. I got the page
pointer using the function __follow_page() ).
Thanks a lot for all the help. Sincerely appreciated.
