Given the scheduler behavior you observed, this seems reasonable to me, and it
seems reasonable to do this balancing by default.  You might consider adding a
module param to set the timeout, and disable the barrier code entirely when 0,
so people can still test the previous behavior.
Independently from this change, you might also consider adding a way to set
CPU affinity for rcutorture threads.  This would allow explicitly spreading
readers and writers across all CPUs, and possibly also allow clumping these
threads together on CPUs in bug-revealing ways.
