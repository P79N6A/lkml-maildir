As I'm smarter than git-bistect I can tell that 2.6.20-rc1-git8 is as bad 
as 2.6.20-rc2 but 2.6.20-rc1-git8 with one patch reverted seems to be OK. 
So it took me only 2 reboots. ;)
The guilty patch is the one I proposed just an hour ago:
  
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux
%2Fkernel%2Fgit%2Fstable%2Flinux-2.6.20.y.git;a=commitdiff_plain;h=fba2591bf4e418b6c3f9f8794c9dd8fe40ae7bd9
So:
  - 2.6.20-rc1: OK
  - 2.6.20-rc1-git8 with fba2591bf4e418b6c3f9f8794c9dd8fe40ae7bd9 reverted: OK
  - 2.6.20-rc1-git8: very BAD
  - 2.6.20-rc2: very BAD
  - 2.6.20-rc4: very BAD
  - >= 2.6.20: BAD (but not *very* BAD!)
