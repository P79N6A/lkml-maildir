Ingo - who's the main apic person these days?

Hmm. Our IO-APIC reprogramming looks pretty simple, and may well be 
correct.
However, it looks like our _local_ APIC suspend/resume is a total piece of 
sh*t.  It's set up as a "system device" and has a single suspend/resume 
buffer, but the local APIC is a per-CPU thing. We even have a comment 
there (written by yours trule back in 2003!) that says:
         * FIXME! This will be wrong if we ever support suspend on
         * SMP! We'll need to do this as part of the CPU restore!
and back then suspend/resume on SMP was just a crazy notion, but now it's 
obviously every-day reality. 
So it looks like we don't reprogram the APIC -at-all- on secondary CPU's.
What am I missing?
