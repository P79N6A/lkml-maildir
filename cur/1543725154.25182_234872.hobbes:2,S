Daniel McNeil and Mark Haverkamp investigated it and found it to be a
valid failure:
    
http://lkml.org/lkml/2004/7/12/227
We were able to reliably recreate it both in and out of the STP
framework, on a variety of systems, with both the May and July versions
of LTP.  We were able to trace it to a specific patch that was
introduced via 2.6.7-mm1 and that began affecting the bk tree as of
2.6.7-bk-11 a week later.
Further, I've just learned that Daniel has developed a patch which fixes
this issue:

Here is the test result showing in the test framework demonstrating
that the patch fixes the issue:
    Summary of Test Results Total Tests Executed: 7242
    Number Tests Passed: 7230
    Number Tests Failed: 3
    Number Tests Warnings: 3
    Number Tests Broken: 6
