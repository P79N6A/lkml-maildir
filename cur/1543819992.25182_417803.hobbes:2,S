Ah, sorry for stuipd description...

No, this is not link order. Note that CONFIG_X86_VISWS/CONFIG_X86_NUMAQ
uses ":=", not "+=".  In case of ACPI=y", it breaks build.
Maybe NUMAQ shouldn't allow ACPI=y in Kconfig (very old Makefile
doesn't allow to build acpi.o), but I think Makefile is ok with this,
and it also fixes CONFIG_X86_VISWS case (very old Makefile also allow to
build acpi.o).

Note that this is boot/compressed/misc.c. We can't share vmlinux's
data in here. However we can share macros, so probably, it's using
"static void * xquad_portio = NULL" hack.
But, in include/asm-i386/io.h, it is declared as "extern". At least,
gcc-4.0 doesn't allow "static" and "extern" mismatch.

Oh, good. Thanks.
