Then this is in no way an API issue. Many OSS drivers (including envy24) 
create separete device files for each input/output channel (or device pair). 
Applications can chose to open the first device file in for all the 
channels or any combination of the devices in mono/stereo/n-channel mode.
All this depends only on the driver implementation. There is nothing API 
related. Any app can open the devices as usual without paying any 
attention on the channel allocation (which is done automatically by the 
driver). xmms (or whatever else consumer app) can open the device and ask 
for stereo access. Equally well a DAB application can open the device and 
ask for full 10 output channels (or anything between 1 and 10). No special 
API features are needed for this.
Best regards,
Hannu
