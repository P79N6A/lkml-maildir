This is very bad I would think - if the main source of entropy data is the
keybaord & mouse, there are a lot of servers out there with no keyboard
and mouse plugged into them that must be really having problems getting
enough data.
I was originally using Cobalt's kernel, so I have my suspicions that they
may have kludged the random number generator into working better with
their hardware.

I've just added that to the natsemi ethernet driver (used on the Cobalt
Qube 3's) and the eepro100 driver (used on the Cobalt Raq 3/4) and it
seems to have fixed the problem, thanks.  I can only assume that this is
what Cobalt did to their own kernels in the first place...

Yes, this would be a very nice idea.
