Ok. I can see what you're saying and I can visualise a patch for ide-cs.c 
which will probably work using a workqueue as you suggest.
I'd like to question whether the driver or the ide code should be taking 
care of this freeing of resources though?
It all depends what a call to ide_unregister()  is supposed to mean. I'd 
have thought it should mean *remove this inferface by doing whatever is 
neccessary to do so*. If its busy and/or in use, wait until it isn't and 
then remove it by queueing some work to do so at a later date.
Offloading this responsibility onto each and every driver seems rather 
rather unwise and will result in a lot of code duplication. Are there any 
circumstances where we need ide_unregister to abort on busy? Even if there 
are would a flag to indicate what it should do with a busy drive be better?
