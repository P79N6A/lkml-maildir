Well I know there is a way to make a pci to pci bridge assert reset on
the secondary bus, which of course resets all devices behind the bridge.
I am not sure when, other than in the bios, this would be useful.  I
wouldn't want to have to go clean up the pci configuration settings on
all the devices after the reset.  I considered doing it to solve a rare
problem with some pci cards, but decided a reboot was simpler.
