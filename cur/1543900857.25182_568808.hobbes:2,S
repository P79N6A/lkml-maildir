This driver (or the generic PS3 code) has appearently problems with
O_DIRECT. 
glibc aborts parted because the malloc metadata get corrupted. While it
is reproducible, the place where it crashes changes with every version
of the debug attempt.
I dont have a handle right now, all I know is that the metadata after a
malloc area get overwritten with zeros.
Can you have a look at this? 
parted /dev/ps3da
print (a few times)
