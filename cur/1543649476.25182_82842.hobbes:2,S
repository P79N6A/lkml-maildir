Oh this is a real ass biter.
I have a workqueue that I setup once. Same data, same function, it never
changes. Every so often I call schedule_work() for the task.
Is queue_task() not reentrant? IOW, can I not schedule work that was
already scheduled similar to how tasklets worked?
Also, after the task has been run, does the workqueue struct's list
member not get cleared?
I'm a bit confused by this, as I expected behavior similar to before.
