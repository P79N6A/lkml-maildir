ext2 doesn't guarantee sustained write bandwidth (in particular,
writing a page to an ext2 file can have a high latency due to reading
the block bitmap synchronously).  To deal with this I need at least a
2MB buffer.
I've modifed ext2 slightly to avoid that problem, but I still expect
to need a 512KB buffer (though the usual requirements are much lower).
While that wouldn't hit the kmap limit, it would bring the system
closer to it.
Perhaps further tuning could reduce the buffer needs of my
application, but it is better to have the buffer too big than too
small.

They only need to be kmapped while data is being copied into them.

Do you mean kmap_atomic?  The comments around kmap don't mention
avoiding it in BHs, but I don't see what prevents kmap -> kmap_high ->
map_new_virtual -> schedule.

When adding the kmap/kunmap calls to my code I arranged them so they
would be used as infrequently as possible.  After working on making
the critical paths in my code fast, I didn't want to add operations
that have an uncertain cost into those paths unless there is a good
reason.  Which is why I'm asking how significant the kmap limit is.
