We're not sure if it is something we've done or just increased usage, but 
bkbits.net is getting hammered lately.  We see load averages in ~15-20 
range pretty regularly.  It's got some nasty characteristics from the
point of view of server/VM system, tons of data and not really any good
working sets.  I'm running 2.4.5 on it and that clearly has to go.  I am
going to try the rmap kernel but I'm open to other suggestions.
