Your diagnosis is correct.  This is one of our blade servers. :)

Our north bridge is a Micron north bridge (see lspci output below).  As
you can see it is not in the "expected" pci bus location.  The fix you
listed above did the trick as you expected.  The server booted fine,
but (there's always a but).....the two drives came up in PIO mode and 
could not even be forced (hdparm -d1 /dev/hd?) into DMA mode.  Looking
at dmesg, I got the following message associated with IDE
configuration:
     ALi15x3:  simplex device with no drives: DMA disabled
The __init ide_get_or_set_dma_base() function in
drivers/ide/setup-pci.c is generating this error.  I noticed in the
source code a "FIXME" comment that seemed to indicate the problem I was
having is a potential shortcoming in the current implementation.  I 
added the PCI_DEVICE_ID_AL_M5229 (my IDE controller) as a case to the
switch construct and this seemed to fix me completely up.  Both drives
came up in udma4 mode (as expected).  My contribution to the "FIXME"
effort would be to suggest that this mod be maded to this function (but
I'm no ide expert).
Thanks for your help,
Dan
