As a parameter it takes a void pointer to the value plus a
length of the object to which the value points. Given this,
I don't understand "negative". The pointer can point to
anything of a specified size so it doesn't have a sense
of +/-.
If the socket call itself checked for sign it would
severly limit what options could be adjusted. Perhaps
the SO_SNDTIMEO/SO_RCVTIMEO might do some checking, but
I think it's valid to set the timeout to -1, meaning it
never times-out.
Cheers,
