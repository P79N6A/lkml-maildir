I think the best way is to release a 2.4.21 kernel with only the
most important fixes (e.g. ptrace, ext3) and no new features. All
new featues which need more testing and are now in 2.4.21-pre could
then go to 2.4.22-pre for more testing (as Alan did with
2.2.25-pre1). This would be a way to react to important bugs very
fast without a lack of enough testing which is just impossible with
the current release scheme. It's just too dangerous to call 2.4.20
"stable" and wait another few month for 2.4.21.
