Matters to whom?  You, or the people actually fixing bugs?
"Broken-endian"?  whatever.
/proc/pci data alone with every bug report is usually invaluable.  It
gives you a really good idea of the general layout of the system, and
you can often catch or become aware of related hardware characteristics
which 
linux/REPORTINGS-BUGS was created to give users a hint that we need
-more- information, and tells exactly what general information is useful
to provide.  We do not need less information.
