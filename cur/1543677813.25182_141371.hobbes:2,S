Well, the problem is probably unsolvable on kernel level (kernel is unaware of 
user's habits in app/mem usage), but I think it's pretty solvable on user 
level - give us a knob to tune VM's behavior. We mere mortals often know 
better how we will use our system's memory, and which apps we will be 
running. I, for myself, like laptop-mode patch (basically, it groups disk 
writes to do them once in 5-10 minutes, thus allowing hdd to sleep a lot) 
very much - when I'm on AC, most probably I'm in office , and turning it off 
is reasonable. When I'm on battery, though, chances are I won't be compiling 
the kernel and/or do other heavy disk IO, instead, I most likely will be 
coding, so echo 1 >/proc/sys/vm/laptop_mode seems appropriate, reasonable and 
useful. 
Could something like this be done with VM/swap policy ?
