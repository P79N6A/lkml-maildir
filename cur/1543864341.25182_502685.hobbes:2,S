Subject: [patch 0/9] buffered write deadlock fix
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/1/29/59

The following set of patches attempt to fix the buffered write
locking problems (and there are a couple of peripheral patches
and cleanups there too).
Patches against 2.6.20-rc6. I was hoping that 2.6.20-rc6-mm2 would
be an easier diff with the fsaio patches gone, but the readahead
rewrite clashes badly :(
Please apply?
Thanks,
Nick
