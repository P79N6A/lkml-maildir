Umm... it works for me.  (No, I don't use devfs, but I do test
e2fsprogs to make sure they do some sane vs. devfs by using UML...)
usermode:/etc# cat /etc/mtab
/dev/ubd/0 / ext2 rw 0 0
proc /proc proc rw 0 0
devpts /dev/pts devpts rw,mode=0622 0 0
usermode:/etc# fsck -NV /
Parallelizing fsck version 1.23 (15-Aug-2001)
[/sbin/fsck.ext2 -- /] fsck.ext2 /dev/ubd/0 
What does your /etc/mtab file show for an entry for the root
filesystem when you're trying to make it work?  Fsck does require that
/etc/mtab is sane, and I'm guessing that you're missing an entry in
/etc/mtab for /.
