Yea... And this affects the divisor calculation depending on type of CPU
and when the CPU is a PXA260 or PXA25x which SSP port.  And worse, the
SSP controller (as opposed to the NSSP/ASSP) on the PXA25x and PXA260
use a different divisor calculation:
Serial Bit Rate = SSP Port Clock / 2 / (SCR + 1)
The pxa_regs.h file is misleading and potentially inaccurate in this
respect.

Yes, but see qualification above.  I will fix this as you suggest, with
some modifications. FYI The CPU differences also exposed a similar
problem with the DMA setup.  Thanks!

Will do.
I will re-post the patch again to today.  Thanks for the help.
