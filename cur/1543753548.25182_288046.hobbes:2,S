FWIW, I have a Gigabyte motherboard with an it87 chip too.  Reading 
about this it87 polarity thing I'm suspecting something is really wrong 
here:
When system is idle, the sensors report shows:
CPU temp = +25°C and CPU fan = 2136 RPM (and rather noisy)
When system is 100% busy (with dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/null):
CPU temp = +41°C and CPU fan =   1288 RPM (and obviously much quieter)
I'm running a 2.6.10 kernel (not -mm) so I guess the BIOS settings for 
fan control are not altered.  And incidentally the BIOS has a setting 
called "smart fan control" set to "enabled" which maps to the ITxxF 
automatic PWM control mode I suppose.  So if the BIOS actually set the 
fan polarity wrong then the fan would slow down when the temperature 
rises and vice versa, right?
