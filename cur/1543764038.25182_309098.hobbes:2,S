I run the test(20 instances of fsx) with your patch on 2.6.12-rc1 with
512MB RAM (where I were able to constantly re-create the mem leak and
lead to OOM before). The result is the kernel did not get into OOM after
about 19 hours(before it took about 9 hours or so), system is still
responsive. However I did notice about ~60MB delta between Active
+Inactive and Buffers+cached+Swapcached+Mapped+Slab
