Yup.

Yes, that is a big concern. However, the same embedded people is
starting to use both kexec and kdump, so they may suffer the issues we
are trying to weed out anyway, even if these patches are not applied.
The difference is that with this new functionality it is possible to
catch potential problems relatively easily, because any incorrect
behaviour this may cause will be easily reproducible and, in most cases,
will reveal itself early at boot time.
As things stand now, I guess we will keep seeing occasional crashes and
strange behaviour in kexec-booted kernels, which in some cases will be
due to incorrect handling of spurious interrupts. Besides, such problems
are really difficult to reproduce because, commonly, we would need to
hit an obscure corner case.

Makes sense. I will look into all the issues I have found so far, do
some more testing (I think a new approach is needed to speed up testing
of these issues...), and get back to you.
Thank you.
