In 2.6.8.1 af_packet.c the logic in create and bind wastes cycles.  When you create a socket 
it calls 
create which sets the socket state on po-> to "running".  Then when bind is 
first called 
it checks this "running" flag, unbinds the previous state created with "create" 
frees the sk and 
prot hook structures sets the state to running=0 then resets the state again to 
running=1 and
reallocates these structures.  This seems to waste some cycles.   caught this 
since I hook create, bind, and unbind in af_packet for our software.  It looks 
like the logic in the sockets layer above causes this behavior.
Is there a reason it should act this way.  Seems wasteful of cycles since most 
peoples just 
call create, bind,   send send rcv rcv rcv send send, unbind
