Where do you get this from? Just change the malloc they use in libc.
This used to be commonly done to protect netscape from itself
(LD_PRELOAD = gnumalloc.o). This is and always has been trivial.

Overcommitment is fine. If you don't want it, reserve your own backing
swap space for your stack. That's all. Then you can't be murdered by
the kernel because the kernel will always be able to page you out.
