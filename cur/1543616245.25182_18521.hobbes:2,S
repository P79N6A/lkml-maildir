They shouldn't take a GNU extension which has been offered
for ten years and suddenly revert it, or unoptionally spit a
warning.  But they keep on doing this.
I've had large codebases which compiled just fine five years ago.
But with a current compiler, same codebase produces an *enormous*
number of warnings.  There's no switch to turn them off and going
in and changing the code is clearly not an option.  The only options
are to:
1: Not use the newer compiler
2: Grotty sed script to gobble the warnings
3: Fix the compiler.
I've done all three :(
