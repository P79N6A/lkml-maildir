This appears to have been a false alarm... my humble appologies!
I'm not sure exactly what was going on, but it may be that I had
some miscompiled kernels... all kernels I was testing with when
I reported this were compiled on RedHat 7.2.93 (the skipjack
beta) with gcc-2.96.  A 2.4.19-pre8 SMP kernel compiled with 
gcc-3.0.4 does not exhibit this problem.
