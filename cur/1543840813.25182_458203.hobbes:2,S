Two hours of continuous reboots on an ICH5 chipset passed without any
problems.  Couple of caveats though -
(1) The "fix" for this bug is to skip the pcs test for SATA ports on
    ICH5 chipsets.  This results in spurious warning messages for ICH5
    SATA ports with no disks attached.
    ATA: abnormal status 0x7F on port 0xCCA7
(2) I have seen the same intermittent bug on ICH7 SATA but
    PIIX_FLAG_IGNORE_PCS is only set for ich5 and i6300esb_sata.  It
    probably needs to be set for ich7 as well.
