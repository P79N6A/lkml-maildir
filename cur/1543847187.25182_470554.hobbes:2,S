OK, lets' take K8 processor performance states (p-states) as an example:
BIOS, which should know 'best' about a given platform, needs to
communicate to the OS what 'voltage' (VID code) is correct for given
'frequency' (FID),
and it can do that via ACPI processor tables (_PSS). Otherwise, OS code
is left with having to manage a HUGE amount 'specifics' (processor
models), and endless driver revisions to account for new parts.
So, one can argue that there's merit on having ACPI, it's just a shame
when BIOS doesn't get it right! (thus the justification for lack of
'trust'... the same can probably be said about other BIOS issues, not
just ACPI)

I violently agree.
