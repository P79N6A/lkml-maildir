Your system should be using the HPET timer to work exactly around
this. AMD 8000 has HPET. Can you post a boot.log?

No, it doesn't. TSC is kept only globally right now.  Obviously
that is problem if the TSCs run at different frequencies (it actually
is a problem even without powernow, just a much smaller one), but
that is why HPET is used instead.
There are some plans to change that in the future, but it hasn't 
happened yet.

The current design is that only the BP runs the main timer, and the other
CPUs use the APIC timer and don't do any own time keeping. I think you
misread the code quite a bit.
And lost jiffie handling can't be dropped no.
A common problem however is that the irq 0 is misrouted somehow,
and gets broadcasted and processed on multiple CPUs. That results
in the time running far too fast. You can check that by looking
at /proc/interrupts.
