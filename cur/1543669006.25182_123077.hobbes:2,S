Nah, its not an ext3 problem (at least not with htree).
I am seeing this same problem, starting recently, with a 2.5 client and
a 2.4 server.  Both are ext3 but neither have htree, and the problem is
new.
I have not yet figured out whether its the 2.5 kernel on the client or
the newly-upgraded Red Hat 9 on the server... but I suspect the 2.5
kernel on the client.
