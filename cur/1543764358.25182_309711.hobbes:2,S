However, it would be easy to allow reordering before "publishing" a revision, 
which would preserve immutability for all published revisions while allowing 
the patch _author_ the flexibility of reordering/splitting/joining patches 
when creating them.  In other words, a virtuous marriage of the BK model with 
Andrew's Quilt.
