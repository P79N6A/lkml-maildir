Your APM bios may have timing bugs. It could also be the printk calls
disturb the register allocations so that what is passed to the calls
in the undefined registers is safe. It could even be missing register
clobbers. (especially given the number of biosen who dont save all
the registers they should)

No

Not really. It also points to APM bios bugs
