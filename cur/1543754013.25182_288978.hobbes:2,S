Sirs,
There is a bug in the CELERON D Prescott C-0 that prevents this
processor to reboot the machine. This processor hangs when you try to
reboot the machine. The people from ECS had already released in
2005/01/11 a BIOS update that covers this problem to the motherboard
648FX-A2(PCB:1.0).
Here is the update description of the BIOS:
"1. Add support Prescott E0, C0 stepping CPU
2. Update Prescott CPU Micro code
3. Patch some Prescott 2.4G CPU (FSB533/1M) cannot restart under WinXP"
And Microsoft have released a workaround for this problem too:
"(KB885626)
This non-security critical update helps resolve an issue where a
limited number of systems running a BIOS without production support for
Intel Pentium 4 and Intel Celeron D processors based on Prescott C-0
stepping can potentially hang on Windows XP Service Pack 2
installation."
Maybe someone from Intel can point to us where is the fix or errata of this
problem? I wan´t to create a patch to workaround this issue.
I´m having some problems with this processor using motherboards
from MSI - 661FM-L.
Thanks.
Camilo
