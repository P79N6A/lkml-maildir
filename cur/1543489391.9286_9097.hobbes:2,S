How do you figure?  The Merced processor wasn't designed with you and me in
mind.  It was designed for people that already buy systems with 1+GB memory
and several 100GB of disk, and spend $1+ million on a system.  Nobody will
notice the difference in cost of 1GB and 1.1GB of RAM. :)
By the time IA-64 hits the mainstream, the cost to buy enough RAM for a
system will be about the same as today.  It will have to be, or nobody will
buy the systems! :)
