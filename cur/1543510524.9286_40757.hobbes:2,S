Just to let you know in case the "freeze" problem is supposed to be fixed in
2.2.13pre11: It isn't.
I compiled the kernel yesterday and at about noon today the machine froze
again. I am currrently patching up from 2.2.5 to see when the "freeze"
change happened. It seems that 2.2.7 is stable. If it keeps going for about
two days I will try 2.2.8 ...
