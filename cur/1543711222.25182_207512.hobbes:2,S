I think so but later than this changeset 1.34 of 19 December.
The patch has no effect.
Also the mouse screws up after a few hours and becomes unusable.
psmouse.c: Explorer Mouse at isa0060/serio1/input0 lost synchronization, throwing 1 bytes away.
psmouse.c: Explorer Mouse at isa0060/serio1/input0 lost synchronization, throwing 3 bytes away.
I will test backwards which version inttroduced problems.
