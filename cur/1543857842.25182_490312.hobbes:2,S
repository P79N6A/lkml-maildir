That makes no sense at all.  pipe_mnt is not created by userland
mount; it's created by init_pipe_fs() and we'd bloody better
have it done before any applications get a chance to run.
Please, explain how the hell did you manage to get a perverted
config where that is not true.  In the meanwhile the patch is
NAKed.
