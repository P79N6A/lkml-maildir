I just queued all of this for 2.6.22.
Is there any chance of getting a fix for the use-after-free that can
be caused by allocating something from userspace, failing to mmap the
buffer and then exiting?  To see what happens, look at how
ipath_create_cq sticks a struct ipath_mmap_info into the pending mmap
"list" (and yes it would be much cleaner to just use struct list_head
here rather than reimplementing a linked list yourself), and then look
at how ipath_destroy_cq() frees the same structure without checking if
it has been removed from the pending mmap list.
