This has not been fixed for at least a year that i can remember - in
Documentation/devices.txt, it says /dev/js* should be char-major-15*,
but in Documentation/joystick.txt it says it should be char-major-13.
I'm assuming joystick.txt is the correct one, and devices.txt should be
updated to reflect this.. before 2.4.0 would be nice.
