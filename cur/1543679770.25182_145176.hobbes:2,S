OK, let's add to the mystery.  Here's my run, on virtually the same
hardware except, I don't do a bzImage.  bzImage is pretty useless
because I don't want to benchmark gzip, so I just do vmlinux.  My times
should be _faster_ than yours, right?
                   Elapsed:     User:   System:    CPU:
2.5.73-mjb2         77.008s  937.756s       90s   1334%
2.5.73-mjb2-highpte 76.756s  935.464s   93.116s   1339%
Yeah, system time goes up.  Something funky is going on.  We should have
the same machines, except that I have twice the RAM, right?  What kind
of fs are you doing your tests on?  I'm doing ramfs.
