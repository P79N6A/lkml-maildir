Maybe I'm missing something, but why don't you use two locks?
One general management lock to create/insert/remove cpusets and a 
low-level lock (maybe even a spinlock) which manages the state of an 
active cpuset.
For that you have to figure out (and document) how the fields in the 
cpuset structure are used in various situations.
bye, Roman
