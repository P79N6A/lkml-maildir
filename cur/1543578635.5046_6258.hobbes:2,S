IRQ 19 on my BP6 stopped arriving a few days ago. 
 19:      90373      90473   IO-APIC-level  usb-uhci
Removing and reloading the usb-uhci driver didn't help. Loading the uhci 
driver just oopsed, which seems to be its normal behaviour on the occasions 
on which I try it.
Rebooting fixed it. I was half tempted to code a 'kick APIC because I think 
it broke' function, but then decided not to bother.
It might be nice in 2.5 to give drivers some way of kicking the APIC when 
they think they've missed an interrupt, much like the network code kicks 
the driver. And to deal more gracefully with IRQ storms.
Once a driver has a way of saying "Oi! Why isn't IRQ x working?" it would 
be feasible to just disable the damn thing if we receive a million of them 
in rapid succession.
