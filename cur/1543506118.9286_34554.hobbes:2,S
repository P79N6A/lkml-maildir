I sent this originally to the comp.os.linux.development.system newsgroup.  
Someone there suggested I forward it to the linux-kernel mailing list.  He 
indicated there have been reports of processes stuck in D state 
(uninterruptable I/O sleep) which couldn't be reproduced.  I believe I can 
consistently reproduce this condition on a 2.2.9 kernel.  I have not 
subscribed to the mailing list, because I don't believe I would be a valuable 
contributor.  If there is interest in pursuing this, please let me know.
Following is the message as I originally posted it.
----------
I'm porting to Linux a hardware debugger we first created for a DOS Extender
-based system with DPMI.  Overall, the conversion has gone quite well; I can 
manipulate PCI space, tweak I/O ports, map and manipulate physical memory and 
so forth.
However, I have had one nagging issue which has caused me great annoyance.  
Whenever I get a segmentation fault, I expect it to take a core dump and 
terminate.  That's not what happens.  Instead, the process appears to hang; 
it is unresponsive to keystrokes.  If I pop to another virtual terminal, 
killing the process has no effect.  "ps" shows it in status "D", which is an 
uninterruptable I/O sleep state.  The file "core" is created, but is zero 
length.
If I run the exact same series of operations with the program in gdb, gdb 
correctly traps the segmentation fault.  It's only when the program is run 
standalone that I have trouble.  This has happened consistently in several 
different cases of segmentation faults.
The reason this is particularly annoying is that, because the process is 
apparently trying to manipulate the "core" file, the system is unable to 
cleanly unmount the root file system at shutdown time, thus causing me to 
suffer through an fsck on the next reboot.
Are segmentation faults handled differently in suid root processes?  My next 
adventure will be to add a SIGSEGV handler myself, although I'm not quite 
sure what my recovery strategy could be...
