Greetings;
The drive speeds seem to be going the wrong way.  Its an nforce2 equipt mobo, 
and I have 3 drives currently in this box.  Running 2.6.22-rc6-cfs-v18 + the 
ftdi_sio.c patch.
hda, the primary on cable 0, is running at around 28MB/Sec.  Its a 200GB WD 
about 2 years old.
hdb, is running at around 79MB/Sec, its a 4 year old 120GB WD.
hdd is running at about 75MB/Sec, is a nearly new 300GB WD.
Can I read anything into the fact that the 2 fast drives are on the slave end 
of the cables, whereas the slow one is master in the middle of the cable?
