Yes. Every 20 minutes or so quite reliably. With that change it has yet to 
crash (its actually running that + page aging + another minor tweak so it
doesnt return success on page aging until we have a clump of free pages.
With just the page aging patch it performed way better but still hung.

The problem is its hard to know which of your patches depend on what, and
the complete set is large to say the least.
