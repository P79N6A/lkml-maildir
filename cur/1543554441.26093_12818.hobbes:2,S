Well, it does not do its best. There are several areas where kernel should
help, things like POSIX semaphores would be much faster with kernel support,
likewise threads if some things Ulrich stated here a couple of months
ago were done in the kernel, POSIX message queue passing is not doable in
userland without kernel help either (I have a message queue filesystem
kernel patch for this, but it is a 2.5 thing).
