I agree with the 1/4th, but in # of lines of spell-fix.txt, not
in output size.
Looking at the changesets he's accepted, it looks like he's
comfortable with changesets of 100 files (see "don't" fixes at
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.5/testing/cset/cset-1.1025.1.38.txt
 )
It probably helps that this was a single kind of change.
My guess is these things need enough manual reviewing
that keeping it down to just a related group of fixes per patch
is a good idea (e.g.
Acknowledge=Acknowlege
acknowledged=acknoledged
together are a Good Idea, more is probably bad).
BTW Linus has been accepting so many spell fixes it's probably important
to work with very fresh sources...
