Probably not.  The _syscallN() macros are broken for the general case
on any 32-bit architecture, since they can't handle multiregister
arguments.
Similarly, a general syscall() function is broken (in the sense that
one would have to have syscall-specific code to mangle the arguments)
on *some*, but not all, 32-bit architectures, since some architectures
have alignment constraints on multiregister arguments, and the syscall
number argument throws off that alignment.
