This is a very important patch that you have created, but you haven't 
articulated what happens in the following scenario (Peter I am making up 
something without knowing your internals, please feel encouraged to help 
me on this).
mysql fsync()'s a file, which it thinks guarantees that all of a mysql 
transaction has reached disk.  The disk write caches it.  You let fsync 
return.  It is not on disk.  mysql performs its mysql commit, and writes 
a mysql commit record which reaches disk, but not all of the transaction 
is on disk.  The system crashes.  mysql plays the log.  mysql has 
internal corruption.  User  calls Peter.  Peter asks, what do you expect 
when you use a piece of shit like reiserfs?  User doesn't care about our 
internal squabbling and goes back to using windows which does proper 
commits.
Or, random application fsyncs, expects that it means that data has 
reached disk, and tells user to perform real world actions dependent on 
the data being on disk, but it is not.
I hope I am totally off-base and not understanding you....  Please help 
me here.
