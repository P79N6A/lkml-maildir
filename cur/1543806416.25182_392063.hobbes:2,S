I would argue its irrelevance
Two cases (lets call them a and b)
	a) The GPLv2 only was always the case
	b) There was no version so it was open to choice
Which ultimately means either
	a) Linus changed nothing
	b) Linus chose a version as the License allowed him to in accordance
with section 9.
So we have two legal outcomes both of which produce the right answer for
any vaguely recent source tree. At which point does it matter ?
My point was to make clear that assuming the GPL original text implies
the version of the code is wrong, and explain why the FSF recommend the
long text.
Is there doubt about the license status of the current code - not in
this area, no. The COPYING file is extremely clear on this, and more
importantly in other possible unclear and problematic areas. For example
the statement that the system calls are not derivative statement which
resolves the biggest interpretation concern of all.
