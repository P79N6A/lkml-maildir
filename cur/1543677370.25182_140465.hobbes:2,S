Probably more to the point, the command `su nobody` does NOT log you
in as user nobody. You need the command `su -l nobody` to do that.
Check the manpage for su to verify that without the -l option, you
are still logged in as user root although you are running with the
effective user nobody.
My understanding is that the permissions checks can succeed when
EITHER your login or effective user would succeed in most cases,
but in some cases, it's when your login user succeeds irrespective
of whether your effective user would succeed or not.
Best wishes from Riley.
