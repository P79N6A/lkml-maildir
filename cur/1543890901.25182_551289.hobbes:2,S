I guess that makes sense.
But apparently you cannot tell what a device supports until you write
to it.
So maybe you need to write some metadata with as a barrier, then ask
the device what it's barrier status is.  The options might be:
  YES - barriers are fully handled
  NO  - best effort, but due to missing device features, it might not
        work
  DISABLED - admin has requested that barriers be ignored.

It seems there will always be hardware that doesn't meet specs.  If a
device doesn't support SYNCHRONIZE_CACHE or FUA, then implementing
barriers all the way to the media would be hard..

I'd rather not add something that we plan to remove.  We currently
have -EOPNOTSUP.  I don't think there is much point having more than
that.
I would really like to get to the stage where -EOPNOTSUP is never
returned.  If a filesystem cares, it could 'ask' as suggested above.
What would be a good interface for asking?
What if the truth changes (as can happen with md or dm)?
