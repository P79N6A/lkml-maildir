I remembered you reported it originally on 2.6.14.N, so I wasn't
searching amongst the 2.6.15 changes at all.  Thanks for the info
that it's at least as old as 2.6.11.3.

I think we'll allow you the luxury of making successful backups for now ;)
Thanks for all your work on this, I'm sure it's irritating to you that
we haven't found the answer yet.  I'm still clueless about it (despite
the excellent clues you've provided).  And personally I don't like
asking someone "try this, try that" until I've a pretty good hypothesis
to devise a patch to test out.  Still thinking it over.  Someone else
may have a better idea of what to try next.
