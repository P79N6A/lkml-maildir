No, since you are using the functionality that was never promised to be
there. Example: fs has a perfect right to copy superblock out of the
buffer cache and slam it back whenever it wants, completely ignoring any
changes you've done to buffer cache. Or to keep it in pagecache and don't
have buffer heads hashed. You are _not_ supposed to bypass r/w filesystem
- it has absolute access to the device and that's the end of the story. So
the problem is not just partition vs. disk caches. You have no right to
expect any sort of behaviour from write access to fs mounted read/write.
It's on the mercy of _many_ things, starting with fs itself.

And dereferncing NULL "flawlessly" gives you zero on some systems. So?

"Your C compiler is buggy, I've upgraded to new release and my program
segfaults now. It used to work! It's very simple:
main() {
	int i = 10;
	printf("%d\n", 100/(i - --i));
}
Waddya mean, 'undefined behaviour'?!?!"
Urgh... What does GRUB actually need from a filesystem?
