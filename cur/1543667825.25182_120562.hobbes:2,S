I just noticed that softcursor.c contains copy of FB_CUR_SETCUR ->
cursor->enable code from accel_cursor(). Either 'enable' field has 
no bussiness in the fb_cursor structure (as it can be always infered from 
set flags, and if softcursor needs some internal bookkeeping, it should 
use some other variable and not fb_cursor's field), or this conversion 
should disappear from softcursor.c, and FB_CUR_SETCUR semantic should
change.
