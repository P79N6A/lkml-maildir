One thing that /proc/pci gives you that 'lspci' historically didn't was
the correct interrupt setup (because kernel irq routing has nothing to do
with the PCI irq config byte on most "interesting" machines).
I don't know if lspci gets that right these days, and the information does
exist in /sys, so there is certainly at least the _potential_ of dropping
/proc/pci.
