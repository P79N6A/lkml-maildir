Guys, these patches have been causing pain for two weeks.  They have thus
far required at least twelve bugfixes and I have every expectation that it
will take weeks in Linus's tree to identify and fix all the as-yet
undiscovered bugs.  They are taking way too much time which could otherwise
be spent on all the other broken stuff people like to send me.
So I've dropped them all.  They're at
http://www.zip.com.au/~akpm/linux/patches/early-param/.
  That includes this
most recent patch of Rusty's.
