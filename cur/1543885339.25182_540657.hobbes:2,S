I have no idea what you mean here.  Care to try again?

"#address-cells" is 3 for pcmcia, so not the default
value (which is 2), so you need to put it in.  The
value of this property is not inherited from the
parent node.
Absence of a "ranges" property means the child bus is
*not* direct mapped into the parent bus space.  If the
mapping you need is 1-1, put in an empty "ranges"
property; if not, you have to put the correct mapping
in.
