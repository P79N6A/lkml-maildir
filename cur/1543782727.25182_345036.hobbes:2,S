You said "full gettext" was required and that the presence of "gettext 
binaries" should be checked what surprised me. It seems this is not the 
problem. Under Linux, libintl.h is not shipped with gettext but with the 
C library if you are using glibc or dietlibc.
I do not question your point that "uClibc is widely used", but it's 
widely used to _run_ a Linux kernel.
You said you are "thinking about small or embedded system with specific 
toolchain". If a system is so limited that you run uClibc on it, is this 
really the right system to _compile_ a kernel on? Where's the problem 
with cross-compiling the kernel for such a system?
