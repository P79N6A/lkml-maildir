There are two unknowns for me here -- the IBM model you use has not been
tested, and the adapter is the old PIIX3 core which is untested as well.
There are a few things I would like you to try, if you don't mind.
- First try a later kernel, there have been lots of changes since 2.5.8
  wrt TCQ. I've attached a patch against 2.5.8-clean (not -dj1), could
  you see if that works for you?
- If that doesn't change anything, please also try and disable
  CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDE_TCQ_FULL.
If none of this makes it work, I'm hoping you can setup a serial console
and do some debug logging for me? If you can, I'll let you know how and
what to capture.
Thanks for your report!
