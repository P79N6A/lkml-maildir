I think that we need the total number of locking calls, not just the total 
number of *contended* locking calls, in order to make the data 
significant. Same for waittime. Yes, this pollutes the fastpath. In the 
contention case, its one extra addition, and for the waittime, its a call 
the sched_clock(). I don't think that's too much to pay for much more 
meaningful data.
thanks,
