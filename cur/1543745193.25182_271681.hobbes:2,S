According to Documentation/pci.txt:
pci_resource_start()            Returns bus start address for a given
PCI region
James> We have encountered at least 2 platforms (HP Integrity (IA-64)

James> PPC eServer: pci_resource_start(pcidev,0) = 0x000003fd80000000;
James> pci bar0 word 0xc0000004, bar1 word 0x0

pci_resource_start will rather give you a cookie that you can pass to
iomap() (ioremap() in the old API) etc. You shouldn't be relying on
the physical bar content for anything in a Linux driver.
Are you unable to access the space after mapping it?
Cheers,
Jes
