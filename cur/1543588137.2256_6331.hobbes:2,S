Eric, 
I think it should be possible to do: 
/* to enable the special stuff, change the "undef" to "define",
   If you really want you can add this to Config.in so that you're presented
   with this choice when configuring your kernel. But it's not neccesary
   for the general public to always see this toggle.  */
#undef CONFIG_SX_SPECIALSTUFF
#ifdef CONFIG_SX_SPECIALSTUFF
...
#endif
Roger.
