In my opinion, you're heading totally into the wrong direction. Nobody
will help you solving your problem with a given fixed method (file
accessing in kernel mode) unless you describe your problem in detail.
There's probably a much better and cleaner way. But unless you
describe your application and the overall goal in detail, please don't
expect too much help.
