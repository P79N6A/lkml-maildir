Changes to the core consist (AFAICS) of exporting a bunch of functions
with no explanation of the way they are used - with some of them it's
really straightforward (and can go in at any point), with some one
would expect really detailed explanation and code review (your comments
regarding fsync_super() export trigger all sorts of alarms for me).
