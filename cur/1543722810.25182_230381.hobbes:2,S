Yes, but what does
	a
	b
	  c
	  d
mean?
The above graph tells us that one or more of (swap_device_lock,
mapping->private_lock and inode_lock) nests inside one or more of
(swap_list_lock, zone->lru_lock and page->flags PG_maplock).
And has no way of telling us _where_, say, swap_device_lock nests inside
zone->lru_lock.
And it alleges that tree_lock nests inside lru_lock, which isn't so.  Is
it?  These guys used to have no locking relationship.  Hopefully that's
still the case.  But how to represent that?
