You're kidding. Tell me you're joking, please. This is the most
superfluous use of a goto I've ever seen. There are good reasons not to
use gotos, such as readability, maintainability, reliability, and the
like. While performance may take precedence in schedule (at least until we
make the compiler smarter), the same is certainly not true here.
I haven't looked at the patch you want me to apply this over (I need to
run the stable kernel on this machine) - does it do anything to rectify
the cause of oom() in put_dirty_page()?
