Commit 2c171bf13423dc5293188cea7f6c2da1720926e2 in Linus' tree seems
strange. It includes more changes than Pavel's original patch, but with
the same commit message. Also, I think the extra changes are broken as
we then would have two parameters that have that contain the same
information, yet the do not have the same ranges.
