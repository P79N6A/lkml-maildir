Looks like they don't want us to use "threads" for various reasons. Those
could be even religious/branding issues, which I have no interests in. My
interest is to have consistent format/info for HT cpuinfo among the kernels.
So can you please change like:
+#ifdef CONFIG_SMP
+	if (cpu_has_ht) {
+		seq_printf(m, "physical id\t: %d\n", phys_proc_id[n]);
+		seq_printf(m, "logical cpus\t: %d per package\n",
smp_num_siblings);
+	}
+#endif
This is consistent with the spec/manual from Intel. They use logical
processor (and thread :-), physical processor, physical package, etc.
Thanks,
Jun

Im just wondering what we would then use to describe a true multiple cpu
on a die x86. Im curious what the powerpc people think since they have
this kind of stuff - is there a generic terminology they prefer ?
