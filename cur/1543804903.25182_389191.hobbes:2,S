What the heck for? That's gross.
If glibc is just providing this info for apps, there should be a
system call for it. Otherwise, being the C library, glibc can
damn well remember what it did.

You exec what, the setuid executable? For other reasons,
that needs to sever all file descriptors to the /proc files.
They should be returning EBADF for all operations.
Oh dear. I think I see why /proc/*/mem reads are far too
restricted. The file descripters are NOT getting severed???
Hmmm, I'm not finding code to sever them.
Well, that's part of a general problem then, including lack
of the revoke() system call that BSD introduced. This hits
hard with device files. Memory mappings get interesting,
though /dev/zero might make a nice substitute mapping.
