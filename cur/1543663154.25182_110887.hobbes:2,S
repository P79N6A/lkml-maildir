   we (meaning some folks here at nrl) already maintain a seperate 
   kernel with atm 'enhancements' locally.  we are very interested in keeping
   linux-atm alive (particularly in the linux kernel) and extending it
   as well.  i would take the role of maintainer for atm if no one truly
   wants it.
This is the situation.
Therefore, please send me a patch to add an appropriate entry
to linux/MAINTAINERS.
Thank you.
