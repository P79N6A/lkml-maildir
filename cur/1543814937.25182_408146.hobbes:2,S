Indeed, this is CFQ-only, AS gets much less uniform data passed in.

Done.

Right, that's better.

Oh, indeed, fixed.

Done.
Created new CFQ patch plus equivalent patch to AS (which additionally
resolves the "shut up, gcc" part in a more elegant way as used in CFQ).
Also now added a comment about the "both crqs wrapped" case.
