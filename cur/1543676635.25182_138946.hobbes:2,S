I mean where can I find the information from which
"* It then loads 'setup' directly after itself (0x90200), and the system
 * at 0x10000, using BIOS interrupts. "
-- bootsect.S
The ability to know how to get the BIOS to do that comes from, e.g. a
book that can tell me how to do that without taking another degree...
Where the information can be found, that says what BIOS memory 
area 0x90200 is for etc.
