Note, my objection wasnt a hard NAK - just an observation. If all things 
considered Andrew still favors the VM_FAULT_RETRY approach then that's 
fine too i guess.
It's just that a quick look gave me the feeling of a retry flag tacked on 
to an existing codepath [and all the micro-overhead and complexity that 
this brings], instead of a clean refactoring of pagefault handling 
functionality into a higher MM level retry loop.
So the alternative has to be looked at and rejected because it's 
technically inferior - not because it's more difficult to implement. 
(which it certainly is)
