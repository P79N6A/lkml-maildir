Hi,
I just installed 2.6.0-test11 on my Dell Latitude D600 (Pentium-M)
laptop and I noticed a strange high-pitch noise comming from the laptop
itself (that wasn't there with 2.4). The noise happens only when the CPU
is idle. Also, I have noticed that removing thermal.o makes the noise
stop, which is very odd. Is there anything that can be done about that?
Another (unrelated) problem I noticed is the fact that since I upgraded
to 2.6, X started behaving strangely wrt left-click copy and
middle-click paste. Any idea what the cause can be? I'm using Fedora
Core 1.
Thanks,
	Jean-Marc
