I found out why, it's the driver.  I'm an idiot for not trying
this before ... I was previously using ALSA's snd-card-ymfpci
driver; I switchted to the OSS ymfpci driver that comes with the
kernel.  My latencies used to be 15ms on average, with spikes >
30ms; they're now ~3ms with some occasional spikes up to 10ms.
The graphs and numbers are up at

An over-run occurs when the latencytest program, which plays a
continuous sound, doesn't get re-scheduled quickly enough.  This
results in a sound dropout because it can't re-fill its buffer.
This is similar to what you would get in XMMS, except that
latencytest simulates professional audio applications which must
run with _very_ small buffers in order to get low latencies.
(Imagine your computer being sync'ed in realtime with lots of
other music equipment and have it drag behind by 30ms -- it
doesn't sound good :).
But I guess my problem's solved ... thanks so much to Andrew,
yourself, MontaVista, Dietel and all the other guys who spend
their hours benchmarking so this can be improved!  If you still
want me to run benchmarks, let me know.  The 15 kernels I've
compiled since starting testing have gotta be useful for
something.
