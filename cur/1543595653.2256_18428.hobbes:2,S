There seems to be a major problem with this board and 2.4.x kernels.
I consistantly get SCSI Input/Output errors on multiple drives that I
know are good when running a SMP kernel.  These errors do no happen
with a UP kernel.  This is happening on multiple systems and with
multiple know good scsi drives of all speeds and sizes.
Test#1:
2.4.2 (redhat 7.1 version)
dd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/null
(fails with input/output error)
Test #2:
2.4.2 (redhat 7.1 version)
noapic on boot
dd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/null
(fails with input/output error)
Test #3:
2.4.2 (redhat 7.1 edition)
dd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/null
PASS!
