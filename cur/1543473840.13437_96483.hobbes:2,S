The message would lead me to believe that it's just overloaded. On the
other hand, the site was heavily burdened by people grabbing full
source trees with every version instead of patches so maybe they shut
it down. At least that's what I remember reading on the kernel list.
I'm sure someone else knows.

elijah.nodomainname.net seems to carry them, along with the
signatures. 
linux-2.2.0-pre2.tar.gz          patch-2.1.99.bz2
linux-2.2.0-pre2.tar.gz.sign     patch-2.1.99.bz2.sign
linux-2.2.0-pre3.tar.bz2         patch-2.1.99.gz
linux-2.2.0-pre3.tar.bz2.sign    patch-2.1.99.gz.sign
As the ftp.kernel.org anonymous FTP denial message says, go to
ftp://ftp.xx.kernel.org
, where xx is your two-letter country code. If
by chance it doesn't have your's, pick one which is closeby
network-wise.
