Not yet.  I'll let you know if I see anything.
On an unrelated note, the trouble with running BK in 32-bit mode seems
to be back:
~ $ bk help
system: No child processes
system: No child processes
less: Bad file descriptor
system: No child processes
This time, there are no syslog errors or other reports to indicate
what's up.  I can't strace it to see where it's dying, because 64-bit
strace won't handle 32-bit code.
