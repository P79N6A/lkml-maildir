Tested P1. The biggest offender on my system is still reiserfs'
search_by_key. The trace is made of a very long loop of :
 0.016ms (+0.000ms): reiserfs_in_journal (scan_bitmap_block)
 0.016ms (+0.000ms): find_next_zero_bit (scan_bitmap_block)
(...)
 0.977ms (+0.000ms): reiserfs_in_journal (scan_bitmap_block)
 0.977ms (+0.000ms): find_next_zero_bit (scan_bitmap_block)
with interrupts showing up in the trace from time to time.
Do you have plans to fix this, or should I switch to ext3 ?
Another point was the ACPI induced latency I was experiencing. I think
that P1 could help track this down. After a fresh boot on an ACPI
enabled kernel, once the initialization-related latency spikes are over,
I reset /proc/sys/kernel/preempt_max_latency to 100, and then I get a
100us latency_trace attributed to swapper/1:
preemption latency trace v1.0

but the weird thing is that the latency sum goes way above those 100us,
the culprit being do_IRQ, regularly chewing up to 1ms !

Do you have an idea of what's happening here ?
