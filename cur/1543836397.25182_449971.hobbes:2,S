Removing the timer-based "ping" might be a good thing to do from the
point of view of reducing power utilization of laptops (but hey, I
don't have a tg3 in my laptop, so I won't worry about it a whole lot :-), 
but I agree that in general the RT patches need to be able to
call functions such as tg3_timer() reliably even when under a high
real-time process workload, without needing to use the blunt hammer of
"chrt -f 95 `pidof softirq-timer`".  (Since not all timer callbacks
need to be run at rt prio 95.)
