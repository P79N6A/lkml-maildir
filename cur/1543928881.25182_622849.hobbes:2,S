In unix, blocking ~= removed from runqueue, no?
OF COURSE it is allowed to cooperatively schedule another task, but
I don't see why you think it should so obviously be allowed to block
/ sleep.
It breaks the basically only invariant of sched_yeild in that the
task will no longer run when there is nothing else running.
