cpu_online_map is (or should be) a standard component of the kernel, eg.
generic SMP code in init/main.c uses it. But this area can be changed in
whatever direction is needed - we should always keep an eye on CPU
hot-swapping's architectural needs.

to compare it this situation to a similar situation, i made
/proc/irq/N/smp_affinity a /proc thing because it appeared to be an
architecture-specific and nongeneric feature, seldom used by ordinary
processes and generally an admin thing. But i think setting affinity is a
natural extension of the existing sched_* class of system-calls. It could
be used by userspace webservers for example.
one issue is that /proc does not necesserily have to be mounted. But i
dont have any strong feelings either way - the syscall variant simply
looks a bit more correct.
