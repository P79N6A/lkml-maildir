Ok, so something else is up. If the mmap file is 2G, and you have 6G of 
RAM, you shouldn't be hitting the dirty limits with those setups.
Of course, it may still be that some accounting thing is simply off, and 
the dirty limits trigger *despite* all the proper config settings ;)

Yeah, if you have something that others can see in action, that is sure 
going to get more people to look at it. 
That said - I'm sincerely hoping that you're not running on a 32-bit 
kernel. Because if so, those percentages are percentages of *normal* 
memory, not highmem (that got changed at one point after people ran out of 
lowmem).
So even at 100% dirty limits, it won't let you dirty more than 1GB on the 
default 32-bit setup.
