  Hi, all. Version 85 of my devfs patch is now available from:
http://www.atnf.csiro.au/~rgooch/linux/kernel-patches.html
The devfs FAQ is also available here.
This is against 2.2.0-pre7. Highlights of this release:
- Compile fixes for driver/sound/sound_common.c (non-module) and
  drivers/isdn/isdn_common.c
  Thanks to Christophe Leroy <christophe.leroy5@capway.com>
- Added support for registering regular files
- Created <devfs_set_file_size>
- Added /dev/cpu/mtrr as an alternative interface to /proc/mtrr
- Update devfs inodes from entries if not changed through FS
				Regards,
					Richard....
