No, I don't see any potential problems applying this patch to 2.6.14.2. 
There is nothing specific to 2.6.15-rc2.
If someone sees that there is something wrong, please yell. The 
main purpose of the patch is not to call release_buffering() at the end of 
st_write() when starting asynchronous write and call it in 
write_behind_check() instead.
