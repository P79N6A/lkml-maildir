I whole heartily agree (for knfsd anyway, I don't use RAID):  knfsd
has been vaguely unstable for as long as I can remember and even now
if someone asks me about NFS on Linux I can't tell them "sure, go ahead,
it works fine".  It's just one big mess with various incompatible patches
floating around, noone knowing which patch subsumes which other and
which patch works with which utilities.
Compatibility is an issue once a service is stable, but right now, I
bet that most NFS users wouldn't care about upgrading their tools since
they already have to go through similar trouble just to get NFS to work
properly in a heterogenous environment.
It should be a priority to merge knfsd patches quickly in order to
eliminate this big ugly mess and finally get to a state where sysadmin
can use NFS with Linux without loosing their sleep.
