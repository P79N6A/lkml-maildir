This diff looks much neater than the last one and I agree with the
principle of it. I don't think its the right time to apply it for two
reasons:
1. We probably shouldn't (can't?) make changes like this in -rc kernels 
2. I would like to see some signs that battery measurement, charging and
suspend/resume are all working on collie before we start applying
patches to support it. Only once that's happened do we know how much
common code we have and what changes are needed. Currently you only
appear to have covered battery measurement?
I have a proposal for how we proceed with this:
After 2.6.15 is released, I envisage a patch which splits the common
sections of sharpsl_pm.c into arm/common and arm/mach-pxa/sharpsl.h into
include/arm/hardware/sharpsl_pm.h. I'm happy to generate that patch if
necessary and pass it to Russell. I'll try and create a patch to show
the structure I'm aiming for in the next couple of days but at the
moment we don't know exactly which code is common and I'd prefer to try
and do the split in one go. 
In the meantime, creating the diffs like the last one show where the
split needs to be and converting those diffs to the final file locations
should be straightforward.
Waiting for 2.6.15 should also give you some time to get the collie
charging and suspend/resume code developed/tested and then point 2 above
will no longer apply. 
I did note your patch adds a copyright header to a file you're mostly
deleting code from?
