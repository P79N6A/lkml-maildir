Why would you need to use threads with a multiplex-like interface like
/dev/epoll ? The reason of these ( poll()/select()//dev/epoll//dev/poll )
interfaces is to be able to handle more file descriptors inside a _single_
task.

It works exactly like rt-signals and all you have to do is to change your
code from :
int myread(...) {
	if (wait(POLLIN))
		read();
}
to :
int myread(...) {
	while (read() == EGAIN)
		wait(POLLIN);
}
