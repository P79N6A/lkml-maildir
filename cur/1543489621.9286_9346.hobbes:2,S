Of course, a negotiation phase would be best.
Small as in small client or small as in small server?
Okay, can I lobby for leaving the default at 4k, but making it a run-time 
configurable option (which I can change via /proc, like 
/proc/sys/sunrpc/nfs_debug) or via sysconfig or whatever mechanism Linux
provides to change such settings?  By doing so, you could leave the
default you like in place and I could set a better default that reflects
my local circumstances where 8k appears to be always better.
By doing so, I wouldn't have to worry about amd and NIS at all.
Erez could trust that a local sysadmin would set a reasonable wsize
default.
If you guys like this idea, I would volunteer to do it myself (this 
change should only be a matter of changing a few defs and adding a 
few create_proc_entry calls, right?)
