	There are 2 problems, 
The driver included in ALL kernels does not work with newer cards and
need to be updated. 
2.2.11 breaks ALL tulip drivers, both the included 89H version (that
is useless with a new card anyway) *AND* 91.  I can cope with
switching out 89 or 91 when I use a newer card, but none of the tulip
drivers are woring with 2.2.11.
	I have not yet tried the latest 91x yet, but flat 91 is known
to work fine with the cards, the breakage seems to come with 2.2.11
Thanks
