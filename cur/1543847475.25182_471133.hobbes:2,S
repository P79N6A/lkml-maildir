Which is exactly what I was proposing in my other mail :)
Read it, you'll understnad my point about the truncate logic... I
sometimes want to return struct page (when the mapping is pointing to
backup memory) or map it directly to hardware.
In the later case, with an appropriate helper, I can definitely do my
own locking. In the former case, I return struct page's and need the
truncate logic.
Ben.
