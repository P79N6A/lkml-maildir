Subject: quota and ways to modify implementation?

I've been thinking about changing the auth/user checking method in
sendmail and pop3 to RADIUS auth schemes. I'm told the MTA delivery
programs for incoming mail, dont actually handle the disk quota checks,
but that the underlying OS does. I'm trying to eliminate all user
information on the mail server. Questions:
A) Is it possible to implement a RADIUS checked quota on a kernel
level..i.e. RADIUS db (ms sql,ms access whatever) contains a quota number
and it's checked remotely.
B) Is this plausible? If not, why.
C) Is there a better way to do it? If so, how?
D) Would implementing a proprietary userland scheme be more plausible, or
even SANE
Any help or pointers to help would be appreciated
