Can you report as to whether the percentages are still the same much
later? (at least 60 minutes).  It appears that the processes that have
used more CPU time overall are getting letting CPU time now, and if
that's really the case all 3 should settle into a scenario where their
CPU time used (2:50, 3:18, 5:20 in your snapshot) pretty much "sync up".
Whether it's desired or not is an orthogonal issue, I just want to know
if the behavior occurred :)
