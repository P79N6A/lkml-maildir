I'd say they will listen if you are able to make a convincing case that
this is a real problem. The problem with scheduler patch and the threading
benchmark is that it optimizes performance under completely impossible
conditions, breaking real world performance. The (in)famous Mindcraft
benchmarks were also shot down, but the real problems uncovered were
considered carefully.
