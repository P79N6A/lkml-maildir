For any issues with Gentoo kernels, please post a detailed bug report to
http://bugs.gentoo.org/,
 even if it's related to something we're just
packaging up like (in this case) mm-sources.
This allows our kernel maintainers to be informed of issues Gentoo users
are having. Our developers will contact the upstream maintainer as
needed to resolve the issue, once adequate information has been
collected in the bug report.
Regards,
Daniel
