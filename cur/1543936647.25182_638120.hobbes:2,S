Access to global variable 'rtc' (the rtc itself) is serialized through the 
spinlock, I see no problem there. If you call read-read-write-read from 4 tasks 
in userspace, it might be _still_ (no change) reordered to e.g. 
write-read-read-read by the scheduler.
In fact, the reading process is stopped while the another one is writing the 
time (due to spinlock).
