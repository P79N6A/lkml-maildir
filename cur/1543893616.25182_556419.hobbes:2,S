That's weird. Some bug in modpost, I'd say.
(Googling around for: section mismatch cacheinfo_cpu_callback)
Yup, it seems a new version of modpost does catch it:
http://readlist.com/lists/vger.kernel.org/linux-kernel/69/349920.html
(Sam's patch there isn't quite right, though, it'll unnecessarily
link in cache_remove_dev() even when HOTPLUG_CPU=n.)

Hmm, but that's not how things are, presently. __exit marked
functions are simply not linked into the kernel (when that module
is being built-in) at all -- this "discard" happens at _build time_
(to save on kernel image size).

You're right, such code (presently) has to remove the __exit
from the cleanup functions, if it wants the __init functions to
use them too.
Coming back to the code at hand, so we have two ways to fix this
(also applicable to the other such examples, as per your patch):
1. Mark cache_remove_dev() and cache_remove_shared_cpu_map()
as __cpuexit, and then whitelist (the __cpuinit marked)
cacheinfo_cpu_callback() so that modpost doesn't barf.
2. Place cache_remove_dev() and cache_remove_shared_cpu_map()
definitions inside #ifdef CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU and provide dummy
{} definitions (not marked either __init or __exit) when
HOTPLUG_CPU=n.
BTW at arch/i386/kernel/cpu/intel_cacheinfo.c:463:
static void __init cache_shared_cpu_map_setup(unsigned int cpu, int index) {}
static void __init cache_remove_shared_cpu_map(unsigned int cpu, int index) {}
is so crazy! What are we trying to "save" by marking these dummy "{}"
functions as __init??? These should in fact be inline, IMO.
There's the "third" option too, of course. Just say bye to the
entire .init.text/.exit.text-discarding concept. We lose a few (ok,
perhaps even several) 100 KB of memory, but save on developer
maintenance effort. But I'm not too sure if this suggestion would
be popular, though :-)
