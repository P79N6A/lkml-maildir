If you just do a blocking read() on the USB serial port, what happens 
when you pull the device? At one point (2.4.20 is the last I checked) 
nothing happened when you did this, the process would just sit there 
forever. There was discussion at one point about doing a tty_hangup() 
when the USB device was disconnected (this causes the read() to return 
with 0 bytes and future open attempts to fail), and a patch was put out 
to do this. I thought this had been merged, but I could be wrong.
I should think that if that works, then your select should be working as 
well..
