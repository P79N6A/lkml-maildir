I agree--I'd love to have such a card.  But the original poster was
noting that current Pentia were quite expensive compared to many DSP
chips.  Requiring the Pentium *and* the DSP would cost even more.
He was asking for a native (to the DSP) port of Linux, not a peripheral.
Perhaps the Palm port (or some other non-MMU architecture) could be
adapted to a DSP.  Unless the DSP had a complete GCC port available,
however, a lot of work would be required to produce one before even
starting on porting Linux.  And although many DSPs have enough control
instructions to implement an OS, they aren't likely to be very efficient
at it (such that code size would exceed even that of RISC processors).
