All register writes would occur in the driver. There is nothing
stopping the code that computes those register values from running in
user space.
A example mode setting IO would take:
  display buffer offset
  width, height, stride, etc - for fbcon to use
  register values to set the mode
Mode setting needs to be serialized. It may be better to do the
serialization before the hotplug event, in that case the mode setting
IOCTL would be implicitly serialized and not need a separate lock.
