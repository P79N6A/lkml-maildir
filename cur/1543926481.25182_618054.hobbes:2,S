hm, CFS should have no impact here. To see what's happening you could 
try to use the latency tracer of the -rt patch and do a cross-resume 
trace.
pick up the latest latency tracer patch from:
  
http://redhat.com/~mingo/private/latency-tracer-v2.6.24-rc2-git5-combo.patch
apply it and enable CONFIG_FUNCTION_TRACING, then pick up trace-cmd.c:
  
http://redhat.com/~mingo/private/trace-cmd.c
and do something like:
  ./trace-cmd pm-suspend > trace.txt
or:
  ./trace-cmd /bin/bash -c "echo ram > /sys/power/state" > trace.txt
this should trigger suspend - then you should do the resume. If 
everything goes well then trace.txt should contain a pretty large trace 
of all the stuff we do during a suspend+resume.
and wait for such a pause and send us the resulting trace.txt.
if it's an SMP box then first do:
  echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/trace_all_cpus
to get a global trace. Let me know if something doesnt work with this 
scheme.
