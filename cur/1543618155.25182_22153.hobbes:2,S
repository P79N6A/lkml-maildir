And then I'd like to see the same test done with a RT task running in
the background - since I assume preempt has as its main purpose
to enable SCHED_FIFO.

I have not seen that argued - certainly I have not argued it myself.
My argument is:
	It makes the kernel _much_ more complex
	It has known costs e.g. by making the lockless 
		per-processor caching  more difficult if not impossible
	It seems to lead to a requirement for inheritance
	It has no demonstrated benefits.

Because the prior cited benchmark was a kernel compile on different trees.
Was the filesystem unchanged between runs?
I'm not suggesting you are cheating, it's easy to overlook something 
critical when there are so many variables.
