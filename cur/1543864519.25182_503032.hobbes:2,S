Last year the subject of DMA engines was put up, however most of the
people interested in the subject weren't even invited. In that case
there's really little concrete that can come out of the discussion.
Expecting everyone to sit down and get the full picture of a subject
in 5 minutes is unrealistic and will not lead to very useful outcome.

Of course, thats why I suggested more like an abstract published in
advance, like why is this subject worthy and what would the person
like to achieve by having it discussed. Hopefully with some technical
ideas included.
Cheers,
