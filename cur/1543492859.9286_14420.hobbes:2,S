Hello everybody,
  Having spent 2 days of full-time debugging, I think I now have
gotten rid of all the page contention issues in the NFSv3 client. One
or 2 pretty serious ones were also found that affect the NFSv2
gathering client, and I'll be making an update of that too soon.
  I hope the stability now turns out to be better, and thank people
for their patience.
  You can find the latest NFSv3 client on
  
http://www.fys.uio.no/~trondmy/src/linux-2.2.5-nfsv3-0.6.0.dif.bz2
(against stock linux-2.2.5)
or on
  
http://www.fys.uio.no/~trondmy/src/linux-2.2.5-ac6-nfsv3-0.6.0.dif.bz2
(against linux-2.2.5-ac6)
I remind would-be testers that they need to get a patched version of
the mount utility in order to test NFSv3. RPMs and a patch against
mount-2.8a are available under
  
http://www.fys.uio.no/~trondmy/src/nfsv3-mount
Cheers,
  Trond
