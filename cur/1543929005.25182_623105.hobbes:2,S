No, no!
You have recreated the problem we have been discussing during the last
couple of days.  If the kobject_init_varg() routine gets an error then
the kobject will need to be deallocated manually.  If the kobject_add()
routine gets an error then the cleanup invoked by kobject_put() will do
the deallocation automatically.
But the caller can't tell in which subroutine an error occurred, so it
won't know what to do when kobject_init_and_add() returns an error.
The only way to resolve this problem is to have the _init routine 
consume no resources and never fail.  That way the only possible 
failure mode would be if the _add routine doesn't work, in which case 
either a kfree() or a kobject_put() would be acceptable.
In particular, this implies that the name should be set as part of the 
_add() call, not as part of _init().  This is more in line with the way 
the code tends to use kobjects anyhow.  Unless people want to name 
unregistered kobjects -- does this ever happen?  And it if does, can 
these kobjects simply be replaced by krefs?
My suggestion: Have kobject_init_ng() accept a ktype pointer but not a 
parent or name.  Instead, make kobject_add_ng() take the parent and 
name (possibly a kset also).  Then when kobject_init_and_add() 
encounters an error, it shouldn't do a _put() -- the caller can either 
do the _put() or just do a kfree().
