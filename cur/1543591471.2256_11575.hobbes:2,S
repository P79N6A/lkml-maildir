Or you can fall back to mounting by UUID, which is globally unique and
still avoids referencing physical location.  You also don't need to
manually set LABELs for UUID to work: all e2fsprogs over the past
couple of years have set UUID on partitions, and e2fsck will create a
new UUID if it sees an old filesystem that doesn't already have one.
Cheers,
 Stephen
