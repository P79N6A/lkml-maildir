correct, for RCU we could allow multiple readers per lock, because the
'blocking' side of RCU (callback processing) is never (supposed to be)
in any latency path.
except if someone wants to make RCU callback processing deterministic at
some point. (e.g. for memory management reasons.)
clearly the simplest solution is to go with the single-reader locks for
now - a separate experiment could be done with a new type of rwlock that
can only be used by the RCU code. (I'm not quite sure whether we could
guarantee a minimum rate of RCU callback processing under such a scheme
though. It's an eventual memory DoS otherwise.)
