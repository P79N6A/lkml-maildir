1) * Possible wasted stats overhead during dequeue..
sched_rt.c: 
Is RT check needed within a RT func? 
dequeue_task_rt() calls update_curr_rt() 
which checks for priority of RR or FIFO.
WITHIN..
static inline void update_curr_rt(struct rq *rq)
are the two lines..
if (!task_has_rt_policy(curr))
    return;
Generally if I am reading this right, then what
 RT task is neither FIFO or RR???
Thus, I think those two lines could be removed.
2) nit....
The comment within sched_rt.c
----->   Adding/removing a task to/from a priority array:
Is placed before dequeue_task_rt() where
enqueue_task_rt() is placed above the comment
Thus, the comment should be moved above enqueue_task_rt()
