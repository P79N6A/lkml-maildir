? Why couldn't it be a bug present in all kernels/drivers ?
Under bugs.gentoo.org there are quiete a lots of those, for example
http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=64728
 and google can show a lots
more.

I had those xawtv crash with an SCSI only system, and on all my
MB/CPU/RAM test I doubt that all hardware configuration were buggy.

I only have DVB hardware, is that also considered as bttv ?
I have tried a lots of different configuration, with or without fb,
playing in the BIOS, pre-empt/no, ACPI/noACPI ... no change at all.
Some things I have noticed : xawtv and kdetv don't need CPU to achieve
the best quality I know about BUT they make the system crash.
kvdr and tvtime needs lots of time and there quality are really lower
than the two others, BUT they don't crash my system.
I can't speak about xawdecode because I am not able to run it under
amd64... neither zapping.
What I do now is to stop xawtv before doing a large copy of files...
I would happily try any suggestion :-)
Thank you very much,
