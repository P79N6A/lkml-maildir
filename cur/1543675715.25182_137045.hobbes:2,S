If this is (relatively) easy to do, I really think it could be a valuable
diagnostic tool. I'd prefer to get a clear "fix your APIC" or any insult
about my hardware config than devices detection dying in endless timeout
loops.
This principle may even be generalized to any other driver which can make the
device trigger an interrupt.
