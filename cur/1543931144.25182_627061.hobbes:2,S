Thats not enough You still need to fix code in ll_rw_blk(), I would
define a rq_flags_bio_match_mask = 0xf for that. 
(and also add what Jens called "needed" with the
BIO_RW_AHEAD selects REQ_FAILFAST.)
And I still don't understand why, for example, "Domain Validation" fails
with the original patch. What sets BIO_RW_FAILFAST and than panics
on Errors?
(All I see is this flag set in dm/multipath.c & dm-mpath.c)
