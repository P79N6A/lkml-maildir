Subject: [SEMI-OT] partition table recovery (URGENT)

 After a bad manipulation, I lost my partition table...
I know it could be possible to recover it if I had written down the type,
begining and ending blocks of 
each partition, but unfortunatly that's not the case.
So I desperatly need to know if there's a way to get this information by
scanning the device (*) looking for a special string (?) identifying the
begining block of my ext2, swap, and FAT32 partitions ?
my setup was : 
hda1 : FAT32 (about 2.5 Go)
hda2 : swap  (about 128 Mo)
hda3 : ext2  (about 2 Go)
The only partition I really care about is the ext2 one, so if there's an
ext2 guru out there...
If someone knows a way to do it or the URL of a tool that can acheive
this, please let me know.
(*) using something like cc-linux to cat the raw contents of /dev/hda
