Don't think so (I hit that one too, I think).
There's no mention of get_online_cpus() in git-sched's watchdog(), and my
symptoms are that the machine appears to suspend to RAM OK (but it might
take longer to do this with git-sched applied).  But it never comes back to
life after you hit the power button to resume it.  
I guess I need to bisect it.  That'll be novel.
