	Yes, the individual driver authors. Either check the names in
the source code or check my Howto.

	Can't agree me, but I'm biased. This is slowly improving.

	Wireless drivers included in kernel 2.6.X are already compatible.

	There is two aspect there.
	First, I want the HostAP driver to be included in 2.6.X, and
I'm trying to make this happen.
	Second, Master and Monitor mode can be implemented only in
drivers for which the necessary hardware documentation is available,
which means only a subset of them.

	There are pros and cons to that. Personally I prefer the
approach taken by the aironet driver (ethX + wifiX). The interface the
driver present to the kernel is *really* an Ethernet interface.
	If you really want easy identification, we could take the *BSD
approach where every driver use it's own unique device name.

	Let's not reinvent the wheel again. What's wrong with IPsec ?
If you want to go that route, at least follow one of the upcomming
standard (802.1x, WPA, ...).
