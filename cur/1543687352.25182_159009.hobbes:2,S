One of the big advantages of RFCs is that everybody can read them. In fact if
one names a special RFC for proving something he said, he should at least have
read it once:
<quote RFC 1812>
3.3.2 Address Resolution Protocol - ARP
   Routers that implement ARP MUST be compliant and SHOULD be
   unconditionally compliant with the requirements in [INTRO:2].
...
   INTRO:2.
        Internet Engineering Task Force (R. Braden, Editor),
        "Requirements for Internet Hosts - Communication Layers", STD 3,
        RFC 1122, USC/Information Sciences Institute, October 1989.

<qoute RFC 1122>
      2.3.2  Address Resolution Protocol -- ARP
         2.3.2.1  ARP Cache Validation
            An implementation of the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)
            [LINK:2] MUST provide a mechanism to flush out-of-date cache
            entries.  If this mechanism involves a timeout, it SHOULD be
            possible to configure the timeout value.
...
[LINK:2] "An Ethernet Address Resolution Protocol," D. Plummer, RFC-826,
     November 1982.

=>
RFC-826 is _valid_
Why do you think it is not valid, Roman? Where do you read that?

Stephan
