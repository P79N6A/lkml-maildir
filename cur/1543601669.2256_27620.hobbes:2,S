the "somebody else has a swap count" is interesting. so we rely on the
fact any swap_duplicate is always run before the swapcache is unlocked.
Also the "> 2" should be "> 1", but really I noticed I cannot avoid
getting a reference so please apply also this patch instead of replacing
"> 2" with "> 1" (it was a race condition):

I see.

Looks ok now :), I guess it would be good to write a comment now, so
maybe other people won't share my worry, the swap_count thing wasn't
very obvious. thanks,
