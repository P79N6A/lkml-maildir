But emailed reports _are_ saved anyway and we _know_ how to get a copy.
From lkml.org, for example.  Why don't we use that?  The only missing piece
is the 'keep a list' thing, but that's not a rocket science, IMHO.
[For example, you can create a bugzilla entry with a link to the lkml.org copy
of the relevant message, so why to require the reporter to file the report with
the bugzilla himself?]
_Moreover_, some LKML archives, for example at 
http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel,
keep track of each thread separately, so you can browse any of them at any
time.  In particular, you can see the _history_ of each bug report sent to LKML
if you have a link to any message in its thread.
Really, if we ask reporters to put '[BUG]' in the subjects of their messages,
you'll even be able to use the lkml.org archives plus wget and a couple of
shell scripts to cherry pick the links to all bug reports sent to the list
within a given time interval.
All of this functionality is out there already.

Well, now, I think that even this statement is not exactly right. :-)

IMO that depends on how you handle it.
