You do not need to be detective to spot this. *Dangerous* changes was announced
quite loudly.

Yes, and it was done deliberately.

Do not ask. If you think that just few functions was changed/renamed then
you are not wrong. You are VERY wrong. Carefull review of FAT needed and
not "try to make it work with big hammer". About question: vm_cache is not
there at all anymore so there are no easy replacement for update_vm_cache
function.

Yes, it's broken since filesystem in non-compileable state is by far better
then filesystem with trash-full-your-disk feature built-in ...

P.S. You should talk with "Alexander Viro <viro@math.psu.edu>" about changes
in filesystems if you really feel yourself strong enough...
