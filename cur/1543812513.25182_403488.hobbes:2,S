Those x86_64 backtraces are quite hard to follow.  They get much better if
you enable CONFIG_FRAME_POINTER, and that makes very little difference to
code quality.

It's hard to say what happened there.  I _think_ it went oom in
get_sectorsize()'s GFP_KERNEL|GFP_DMA allocation.  (Jens, do we really need
GFP_DMA in there?)
But that's only a 512-byte allocation.  Something else must have used up
all the DMA zone.
