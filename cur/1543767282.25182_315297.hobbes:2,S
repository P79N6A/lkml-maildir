The other problem is: How would new mounts  in any of these namespaces
propogate to other namespaces owned by the same user? 
I mean, how will the other namespace's belonging to the same user, be
able to pull the mounts into their namespaces?  shared subtree won't be
a solution because these namespaces won't have a parent-child
relationship to begin with, for the propogation to be set up.
