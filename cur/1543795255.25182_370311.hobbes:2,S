I did use git to make sure these patches all applied cleanly to your
latest tree.
I wasn't using git to send stuff to you after -rc1, as it makes me make
extra sure the stuff is really needed.  Just a hold-over from when I
thought we weren't supposed to use git to send stuff to you after -rc1.
If it's easier for you, I can use git to send you these, and future
patches.
