The kernel is trying to access the primary (block 3) and secondary
(block 22) IDE interface, then trying to access the floppy.  And it
thinks there is something in the floppy drive.  You have some user code
that is trying to access these devices, the kernel will not do it on
its own.  Are you running automount or something similar?

The kernel is getting interrupts from the floppy.  If there is nothing
loaded, you probably have a hardware or cable problem.
