Does kernel 2.4.x compile and run well for all of our supported archs?
Do programs compiled against a glibc with LFS (2.4.x kernel) support, and
using that LFS support, work on kernel 2.2.x machines?
If the answer to the first one is "no", then the spread of LFS will be
slow in Debian, until 2.4.0 becomes stable enough to use. If the answer to
the second is "no", then you wont see LFS support in Debian till post
woody.
Secondly, anyone who thinks they know what they are doing, can simply
download the Debian glibc sources files, and build against kernel-2.4.0
headers with this simple command:
LINUX_SOURCE=/usr/src/linux-2.4.0-test11 apt-get -b source glibc
Simple, eh? :)
