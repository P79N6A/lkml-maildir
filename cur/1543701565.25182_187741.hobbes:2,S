Probably my english is bad but I don't understand what are you trying to say (except the german part ;-))
A bit more about pre/post-change (if this is what are you trying to say) - I need allways pre-change because after file is changed I can no longer get original (pre-change) version of file which I need for snapshot.

Yes - that's what I'm now doing. Just now I'm going to reboot my machine (<grr>) and try if EXPORT_SYMBOL(sys_open) works as I think it should ;)
Anyway - thanks for hints.
