Well it could also be the fact that almost no activity was going on on both
systems.

At least ext2 and probably all the journalling fs lacks a feature the HFS+ from
the Mac has (bad tongues might say "needs"), to keep open files without activity
in a state where a crash has no effect. I don't know how it is done since I'm no
fs expert but my experience with my Mac (resetting about once a month without
loosing anything) shows that it's possible.
I'd rather like to see this feature appear in one fs for Linux (preferable
ext2). I think it's always better to not have error instead of fixing them afterwards.
