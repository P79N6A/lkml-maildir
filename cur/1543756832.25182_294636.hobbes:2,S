I think you misunderstand; your comments don't seem to make sense unless
I assume you're imagining output feedback mode:
x[0] = encrypt(IV)
x[1] = encrypt(x[0])
x[2] = encrypt(x[1])
etc.
Obviously, this pattern will repeat after some unpredictable interval.
(However, owing to the invertibility of encryption, looping can
be easily detected by noticing that x[i] = IV.)
But I was talking about counter mode:
x[0] = encrypt(0)
x[1] = encrypt(1)
x[2] = encrypt(2)
etc.
It should be obvious that this will not repeat until the counter
overflows k bits and you try to compute encrypt(2^k) = encrypt(0).
One easy way to generate unpredictable 16-bit port numbers that don't
repeat too fast is:
highbit = 0;
for (;;) {
	generate_random_encryption_key(key);
	for (i = 0; i < 20000; i++)
		use(highbit | encrypt15(i, key));
	highbit ^= 0x8000;
}
Note that this does NOT use all 32K values before switching to another
key; if that were the case, an attacker who kept a big bitmap of reviously
seen values could preduct the last few values based on knowing what
hadn't been seen already.
Of course, you can always wrap a layer of Knuth's Algorithm B
(randomization by shuffling) around anything:
#include "basic_rng.h"
#define SHUFFLE_SIZE 32	/* Power of 2 is more efficient */
struct better_rng_state {
	struct basic_rng_state basic;
	unsigned y;
	unsigned z[SHUFFLE_SIZE];
};
void
better_rng_seed(struct better_rng_state *state, unsigned seed)
{
	unsigned i;
	basic_rng_seed(&state->basic, seed);
	for (i = 0; i < SHUFFLE_SIZE; i++)
		state->z[i] = basic_rng(&state->basic);
	state->y = basic_rng(&state->basic) % SHUFFLE_SIZE;
}
unsigned
better_rng(struct better_rng_state *state)
{
	unsigned x = state->z[state->y];
	state->y = (state->z = basic_rng(&state->basic)) % SHUFFLE_SIZE;
	return x;
}
(You can reduce code size by reducing modulo SHUFFLE_SIZE when you use
state->y rather than when storing into it, but I have done it the other
way to make clear exactly how much "effective" state is stored.  You can
also just initialize state->y to a fixed value.)
