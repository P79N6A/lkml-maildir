Ok, still haven't heard much discussion of metafs vs file-as-directory, 
but it seems like it'd be easier in metafs.
Basically, we are entirely POSIX compliant outside of metafs, so that 
/filename is a file and may be hardlinked, and /directory/ is a 
directory and may not.  No problems yet.
Inside /meta/inode, we have no problems yet because any hardlinks 
created outside /meta won't even show up as hardlinks here, so we don't 
get hardlinked directories.
Inside /meta/vfs, where we can find the metadata of '/filename' under 
'/meta/vfs/filename/...', we have what looks like a problem -- we may 
have hardlinks created outside metafs, which will show up as two 
directories inside metafs, so those directories are hardlinks.
I don't think that's such a problem, since we won't allow users to 
change anything in /meta/vfs except when it's inside metadata, such as 
'/meta/vfs/some/where/...'.
Thus, it's impossible to create a hardlink to a directory unless we do 
it *outside* metafs, as a hardlink to a file.
Now, the question I asked is, what if we want hardlinks *inside* metafs, 
*inside* the metadata for a given file, and would we ever want such a 
thing?  Because we can avoid the whole problem if we just disallow any 
sys_link calls inside metafs.
Of course, sometimes we want to have a chunk of metadata that appears 
*exactly* as if it were a normal, POSIX-compliant directory tree, such 
as the contents of a tarball or a zipfile.  In that case, we might want 
to have the "zip" plugin allow hardlinks inside 
"/meta/file.zip/.../contents" -- the only restriction is that any 
hardlink made to a file inside 'contents' must be made to another file 
inside 'contents'.
