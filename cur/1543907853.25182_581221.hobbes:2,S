Good so far, but we need to fix it on non-SMP architectures too, since 
drivers may use atomic_t in interrupt code.  Ideally I'd like to be able 
to remove a whole bunch of barriers, since they cause a lot of needless 
re-fetches for everything else in the loop.  We should also document the 
semantics of atomic_t to ensure consistency in the future.
