It seems to be a bit broken, currently -- the most recent version
I can find (v1.5 on tsx-11 in ALPHA/scsi) thinks theres a number
which is the major mode for all scsi devices.
Is there a more recent version?  [Doesn't seem like it would be
too hard to fix, but if someone is already maintaining it...]
