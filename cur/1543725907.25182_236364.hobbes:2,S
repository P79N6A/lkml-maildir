http://redhat.com/~mingo/voluntary-preempt/voluntary-preempt-2.6.8-rc2-J7
Changes since -J4:
- fix the latency that occurs when a large number of files are deleted: 
  the guilty one is select_parent() - this should fix the Bonnie latency 
  reported by Lee Revell.
[ the ones below add conditional reschedule points that dont affect 
  users who have kernel_preemption turned on:]
- fix /proc/PID/maps latencies
- fix latencies triggered by 'df' on a large filesystem
- fix exec() latency when dealing with large environments
- add might_sleep() to lock_buffer()
