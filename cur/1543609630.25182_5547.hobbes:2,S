Well, he wanted to benchmark everyday use, and disk latency is also an
issue for everyday use, of course; so that's kind of pointless getting
rid of I/O and benchmarking the cache. fsync() efficiency comes into
play and wants to be benchmarked as well. How do you know if your
fsync() syncs what's needed, the whole partition, the partition's meta
data (softupdates!) or the world (all blocks)?
