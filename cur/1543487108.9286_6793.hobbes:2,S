What version of ISC DHCP are you using? The latest beta version
(2.0b1pl14) does require socket filtering (CONFIG_FILTER=y). From the
README:
------------------------------------------------------------------
                    LINUX: PROTOCOL NOT CONFIGURED
One additional Linux 2.1/2.2 issue: if you get the following message,
it's because your kernel doesn't have the linux packetfilter
configured:
   Can't install packet filter program: Protocol not available
   exiting.
If this happens, you need to edit your linux kernel .config file, set
CONFIG_FILTER=y, and rebuild your kernel.   If the preceding sentence
made no sense to you, ask your Linux vendor/guru for help - please
don't ask us.
------------------------------------------------------------------
I experienced personally this problem.
By the way, if you use Debian I have just uploaded to master this new
version.
Regards,
Eloy.-
