So am I. Usually, you connect two different machines with a serial cable.
(Leaving out the special case of connecting ttyS0-ttyS1 on the same machine.)
This poses the first question: whose kernelspace? the sender or
the receiver side? And by "this date" do you perhaps mean
"whatever was sent", or specifically a date? And print to _where_?
Up to now, it looks like you want to do "cat </dev/ttyS0" in-kernel.
