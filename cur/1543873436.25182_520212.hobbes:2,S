Are we going to get rid of the file and intr arguments btw? I'm not sure
intr is useful, and mapping is probably enough to get whatever we inside
->write_begin / ->write_end.
Also, I noticed that you didn't export block_write_begin(),
simple_write_begin(), block_write_end() and simple_write_end() - I think we
want those for client modules.
Attached is a quick patch to hook up the existing ocfs2 write code. This has
been compile tested only for now - one of my test machines isn't
cooperating, so a runtime test will have to wait until tommorrow.
One interesting side effect is that we no longer pass AOP_TRUNCATE_PAGE up a
level. This gives callers less to deal with. And it means that ocfs2 doesn't
have to use the ocfs2_*_lock_with_page() cluster lock variants in
ocfs2_block_write_begin() because it can order cluster locks outside of the
page lock there.
My ocfs2 write rework will be a more serious user of these stuff, including
the fsdata backpointer. That code will also eliminate the entire
ocfs2_*_lock_with_page() cluster locking workarounds for write (they'll have
to remain for ->readpage()). I'm beginning work on cleaning those ocfs2
patches up and getting them plugged into this stuff. I hope to post them in
the next day or two.
