I got 4.6 from rawhide; -x isn't in the man page.
[summer@numbat summer]$ man hdparm | grep -w x
[summer@numbat summer]$ man hdparm | grep -w X
              good  idea to use the appropriate -X option in com-
       -X     Set the IDE transfer  mode  for  newer  (E)IDE/ATA2
              drives which support alternate transfer  modes,  -X
