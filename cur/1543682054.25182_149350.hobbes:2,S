Part of the problem is due to a bug in my BadRAM patch though I am unable to find it. :-(
Any chance any of the oopses pointed to anything w.r.t. the BadRAM patch?
I am now running with CONFIG_PREEMT=n and without BadRAM.  I don't trust my Promise IDE controller, it might also be causing problems, I am getting IDE errors off of it with the  Barracuda's.  I have ordered a new one, which should arrive  in the morning (Friday).  I will let you know how it goes...
