Might make sense.  Right now I would be more interested in getting the
questions at the bottom answered.  Possibly the right answer might be
"here is a patch to fix it".

True.  Waiting on I_NEW would be equivalent to waiting on I_LOCK.  To
some degree I still prefer the current method.  I_NEW is a state, while
I_LOCK is a lock or completion method.  Having a confusing mix of
state/lock/completion bits is bad enough.  Having such a mix of uses for
a single bit could be even worse.

Two seperate deadlocks exist, we agree on this.  I_SYNC only solves one
of the two.  LogFS solved the second deadlock by implementing its own
destroy_inode() and drop_inode() methods.  Any inodes that would cause
the get_new_inode() deadlock get cached and logfs implements its own
iget() method to return a cached inode from any deadlock-prone codepath.
It is not a pretty solution, but ilookup_nowait() would definitely cause
data corruption for logfs, so that was not an option.  Better ideas are
very welcome.
