IMHO the linux-kernel archive software is what should be fixed.

I think that the fact that there are approx. 65536 ticks per hour is a
coincidence, because the divider is set to 65536, the biggest a 8253
timerchip can do. Ralf Brown's interrupt list says:
"there are approximately 18.2 clock ticks per second, 1800B0h per 24 hrs"

The frequency is four times the NTSC color subcarrier frequency, which is
defined as (455 / 2) * (525 / 2) * (60 * 1000/1001) Hz =~ 3.579545 MHz.
They used TV crystals because they're cheap.

No, the way is resolve this is to ask IBM why they did what they did.
I also have some questions for them about the ISA bus :-).
They're probably too ashamed to answer...
