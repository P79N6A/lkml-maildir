Yes, since EFI is the only method for this platform it should probably
be the platform's only implementation of genrtc.
At the moment it is a bit confusing because "generic RTC" sounds like
something that ought to work on any platform, when of course it does
not.  So if the changes to genrtc would be large, perhaps it would be
better to just fix Kconfig for now...
Do you think a patch to refactor efirtc into genrtc would be accepted?
