Yes, but my technique can be applied to any kernel. It does not require
an preemptible kernel...
I.e. measures time from the moment a reschedulation was reqired to it
is actually done - independent of how it is done...
And if you run something that needs periodic reshedules you will detect
actual problems.
And thus it can be used as a bench, it is hard to describe skips in music,
textual data is easier to send by mail...
But I agree that Roberts is better to find the critical ones!
