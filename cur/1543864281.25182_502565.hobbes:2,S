Yes. LKML is a list, list with heavy load. For better tracking of
threads, MUA maybe better, sometimes.
Problem with Cc list isn't problem, actually:
<
http://cr.yp.to/proto/replyto.html>
("Reply-To" is forbidden by vger)
If this will be adopted by all Mail/News UAs, it will be OK.
As for my slrn, it lets me to edit whole message, i.e. incuding
headers, so until i will implement something in the sources, i can
copy "MAil-Followup-To" by hands ;D
If somebody will get lkml mbox archive, can you import it into gmane,
please.
