In fact I don't see how to use LSM hook to get information like PID of
the parent and the child. As far as I understand LSM hook, I can
register my own pointer to security_operations and like this, I can add
an hook in fork through the security_task_create() right? So my function
will be called each time a new process will be created but the only
parameter passed to the function is the clone_flags.
Is it possible to get the parent PID and the child PID which are
involved when the fork occurred?
Thank you very much for your help,
Guillaume
