That's the case with a capability, obviously, it's less clear that if you
had a flag on the file that could happen, since any processes doing a
mmap() on the file would get LPS.

mmap() returns results codes, I personally would have no problem with a
program having to cope with getting one if that's what it takes. This
wasn't (and isn't) my issue, but it seems that Linux has been so clever in
other ways that it would be desirable to address the problems caused by
crappy application software.

Then I hope someone gets the shared, paged or otherwise smaller entries
working, I suspect some of my machine have more memory in page tables than
user memory :-(_
