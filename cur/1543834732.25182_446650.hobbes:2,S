I stop getting any interrupts from the device in question (either the
on-board UHCI controllers or the on-board SATA controller) -- i.e. mouse
movement gets jerky because uhci-hcd is operating purely by polling or I
start getting libata timeouts in my logs.
I have an abomination of a systemtap script which calls
unmask_IO_APIC_irq directly which instantly "fixes" it when things go
wrong.
I also have another stap script which records stack traces when
mask_IO_APIC_irq and unmask_IO_APIC_irq called in order to check if the
IRQs are actually getting turned off without the kernel's knowledge, but
when I run that in the background, the problem doesn't ever manifest
itself.
