I don't see how what I wrote above has any relation to this 
accusatory rant.

Try reading what I wrote: "an application or GUI"

More ranting.
I cannot help the feeling that you are avoiding the question by
recourse to irrelevant, emotional armwaving:
Why can albods not be implemented as directories filled with 
files with a standard library to access them?
This would work on *any* platform. It would be very lightweight. 
Components of an albod could me manipulated with standard tools. 
The level of trolling posts to lkml would drop. It would not
bloat the kernel. It would not screw up libc. Application users
would see a single object.
You way however is to introduce a kernel change which is, by
nature, linux-only. Hope that the app developers use it. Hope
the BSD developers copy it and then hope that the rest of the
software industry follows suit.
I don't think so.

Damien Miller
