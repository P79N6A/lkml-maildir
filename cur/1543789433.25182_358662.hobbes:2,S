Nothing displayed - the penguin just sits there.
Seems he's not hung, merely waiting for something, even
ctrl+alt+del does a reboot.

Didn't seem to help.  I get some text _before_ the penguin
appears, thre last I was able to read before the blackout
and the penguin was something about USB storage.
I had both vgacon and fbcon compiled in.  I am retrying with
vgacon only, no framebuffer support, to see if it is a framebuffer
or fbcon problem.  This setup worked with 2.6.14-rc3 though.
