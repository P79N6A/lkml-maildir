Hi, 
Found out !
cdc-acm wants both interfaces to be ready (cur_altsetting initialized) when acm_probe() is called. Hence, we have to make two parts out of the loop in message.c::usb_set_configuration(): one to init things, one to register them. 
The attached patch does that. It fixes the oops, and doesn't break any of my USB peripheral (printer, scanner, mouse, and diskonkey).
I hope it's fine enough to go in :)
