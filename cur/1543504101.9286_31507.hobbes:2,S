"Profusion" is Intel's name for its chipset that lets
you build an 8 CPU SMP system.
Linux has been running for months on 8-way systems
based on a related chipset, although I don't know if they've
shipped.  See e.g.

Good point.  That's something that Microsoft
gloats over.  Somebody posted a TPC result for Linux a while ago,
but it was unofficial, and TPC made them take it down.
We need some Linux hardware vendor who's trying to 
sell into the database market to pony up the cash 
for an official TPC benchmark on an 8-way Linux box.
It won't be IBM or Compaq, since they have other
architectures to push.  Maybe SGI?
