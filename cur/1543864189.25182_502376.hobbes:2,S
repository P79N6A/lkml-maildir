Needs another page flag to determine what list the page is on (eek).

We'd need to determine whether some other vma has mlocked the page too. 
That's either the page_struct refcount or the vma walk.  The latter is
equivalent to what I'm suggesting.

I'm still not sure what problem we're trying to solve here.
Knowing how many mlocked pages there are in a zone doesn't sound terribly
interesting and I don't recall ever wanting to know that.
Being able to keep mlocked pages off the LRU altogether sounds more useful.
It's all rather a tight corner case - people don't use mlock much.
