Lots of embedded systems don't have a PCI bios in the usual sense, and
cannot run the x86 code in the ROM firmware either. That doesn't appear
to be a big problem when setting PCI_ROM_SHADOW but those platforms may
not all be able to access the shadow rom if one exists.
Can you fix the comment in drivers/pci/rom.c to reflect the changes.
Otherwise looks good.
