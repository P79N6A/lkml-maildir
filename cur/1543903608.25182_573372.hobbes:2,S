I'm fairly sure this is already known about on SPARC64 (see David Miller's 
email ""build-id" changes break sparc64"), but I just thought I'd let people 
know the warnings are also visible on x86_64:
"ld: warning: Cannot create .note.gnu.build-id section, --build-id ignored."
gcc (GCC) 4.1.3 20070718 (prerelease) (Debian 4.1.2-14)
GNU assembler (GNU Binutils for Debian) 2.17.50.20070718
The kernel boots and works fine, however. The above tools are from Debian 
unstable.
