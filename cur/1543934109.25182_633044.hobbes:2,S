OK, thanks for that hint.
I look at this after my next tests.

Is there any debug option I could turn on to catch this?
Hmm... __alloc_skb() uses kmem_cache_alloc_node() and I did run
-rc3-mm2 a long time with slub_debug=FZP and that did not catch
anything. Shouldn't the poisoning catch that? (Sorry if this question
is stupid, but while I can read C, I'm not a kernel expert)

I will try -rc6-mm1 and vanilla -rc6 and report back.
