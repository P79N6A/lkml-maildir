No. I agree ntp_scale() is a performance concern. However I'm not sure
how your suggestion of just slowing or tweaking the timesource
mult/shift frequency values will allow us to implement the expected
behavior of adjtimex().  We need to be able to implement the following
adjustments within a single tick:
1. Adjust the frequency by 500ppm for 10usecs 
2. After that adjust the frequency by 30ppm for the rest of the tick.
We can see how much of this can be fudged or generalized, but I'm
hesitant to be too flippant about changing the NTP behavior for fear
that the astronomers who so dearly care about leap seconds and minute
time adjustments will "forget" to mention the asteroid heading towards
my home. :) 
I may have asked this before, but w/ 32 bit mult and shifts, how
granular can these adjustments be?
Also additional complications arise when we have multiple things (like
cpufreq) playing with the timesource frequency values as well. 
thanks again for the thorough review!
