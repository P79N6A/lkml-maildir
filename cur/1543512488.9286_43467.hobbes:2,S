When I try to boot 2.3.20, I get:
hdc: IRQ probe failed(0)
hdc: IRQ probe failed(0)
hdc: LTN301, ATAPI CDROM drive
hdc: IRQ probe failed(0)
I also get:
PCI: Interrupt Routing table found at 0xC00f7730 (router type 8086/71C0)
PCI: Assigned IRQ-0 to device 01:00.0 (PIIX4-NEW)
at boot. Unlike some of the other messages, I don't get an oops. Device
01:00.0 is my AGP video card.
I still get the ide1: 0x...., irq 15 message as normal.
The light on my CDROM stays on, and I get lots of:
hdc: Lost interrupt
messages
Thanks,
Bradley
