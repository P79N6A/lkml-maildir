Hello!
disclaimer: Im not on kernel list but I think it may be interest for you.
I have 2 linux box (a and b :)
A is debian 2.1 slink
B is also debian 2.1 slink
both are running kernel 2.0.36 and nfs-server is 2.2beta37 and netstd
3.07-7slink.3
B  has a exports like this
# /etc/exports: the access control list for filesystems which may be exported
#		to NFS clients.  See exports(5).
/	$B-IP(rw,no_root_squash)
...
in A I did
mount B:/ /cdrom
ok cdrom is a dir.
The problem is 
ls /cdrom/debian/debian/dists/slink/main/binary-i386/web/
 If I redirect the output to a file, nothing happens
 If I dont redirect the output 
ls says: 
ls: /cdrom/debian/debian/dists/slink/main/binary-i386/web/php3-imap_3.0.5-3.deb: Is not a directory
and the same for the rest of the files in the directory.
Also /cdrom becames a file not a directory:
-rw-r--r--   1 cbf      root       443330 feb 17 12:15 /cdrom
mount still shows that B:/ is still mounted on /cdrom.
If I umount /cdrom, /cdrom became into a directory like it was.
and then I can mount B:/ into /cdrom and repeat the error.
No error is shown, not even in
/var/los/{syslog,debug,messages,kernel}{.log,} of any host.
BTW I also make a dir with other name and the result was the same. And
not only is ls, also when using mc and changing to the dir.
also with bash, and more progs I think...
I keeping the directories that shows this error.
BTW2: libc is: 2.0.7-19981211-6
      ldso is: 1.9.10-1
The kernel on box B is from ftp.kernel.org and compiled.
The kernel on box A is a kernel made by debian that is installed by
default.
Bye
    Carlos Barros.
