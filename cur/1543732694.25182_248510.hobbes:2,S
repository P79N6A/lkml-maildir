Lee,
A few weeks ago you wrote that "the worst latency I was able to trigger
was 46 usecs", now it's 160 usecs.
Ingo has done much work on his patches since then.
Why the worst latency is higher now? I presume that the latency
measurements technique are more accurate and the 46 usecs was
inaccurate?
