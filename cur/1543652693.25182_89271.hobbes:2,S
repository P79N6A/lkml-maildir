Yeah, I forgot about the old 16-bit pcmcia crud. Ugh. At least 32-bit 
cardbus works fine.

I think Al convinced Rusty that most drivers don't need to worry and that
Rusty was a bit over-eager (ie sound, much of char, all of block and fs
should all be handled by upper layers without the races)
I think Rusty has most of the pieces, but he's apparently flying around 
the world right now ;)
