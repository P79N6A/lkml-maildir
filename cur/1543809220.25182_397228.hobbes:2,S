Sorry, I still can't see a way to read your response to me in that way.
When I said "X", you said "AFAIK, X is false".  More than once in the
same post ... e.g. you say "all hardware must be re-probed", I said "all
is wrong" and provided a common counterexample with USB, then you still
said "all/AFAIK".  And then tried to switch to another topic (see below).
I don't have time to waste on such non-dialogue.

Odd, data loss wasn't even mentioned in any of the comments of yours
to which I was responding.  I was providing corrections to what you
were writing about suspend-to-RAM cases.
