It's not about /usr/include/asm/resource.h, it's about
/usr/include/asm/unistd.h, where the syscall numbers are defined.
This is presumably what the "#ifdef __NR_ugetrlimit" in
sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/i386/getrlimit.c is meant to be testing against --
nothing in the glibc-2.2.5 distribution itself defines that symbol. Surely a
Linux glibc doesn't compile without the target system's linux/* and asm/*
headers?
2.4's /usr/include/asm/unistd.h defines __NR_ugetrlimit but 2.2's doesn't.
