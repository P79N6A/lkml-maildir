> The more ioc's you have, the more space you will use.
Default SW IOTLB allocation is 64MB ... how much should we see
used per ioc?
Kamelesh: You could try increasing the amount of sw iotlb space
available by booting with a swiotlb=131072 argument (argument
value is the number of 2K slabs to allocate ... 131072 would
give you four times as much space as the default allocation).
