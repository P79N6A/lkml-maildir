BTW.  These traps allow the kernel in NT to initiate a ring transition
"upward" into specific Ring 3 applications to allow the kernel to pass
callbacks directly into the IIS server code rather than wait for the
next "poll" event on the IP sockets interface in NT.   It works by
elminating latency for ACK packets .... One of my good friends up North
was bragging to me about how they stomped Linux's ass by putting in this
optimization and how their Ring3 mechanism with IIS was better than
Apache Linux due to this capability .....
