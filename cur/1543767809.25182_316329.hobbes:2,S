Hi Andrew & Jan Kara,
I have an extremely simple patch to fix the problem.
Basically, move the journal_start_handle from writepages()
to ext3_writepages_get_block() (which gets called after locking
the page). What am I missing here ? The patch can't
be that simple :(
Please let me know.
BTW, I haven't done enough testing with the patch yet.
Thanks,
Badari
