that is definitely a good idea, that's why I resurrected in my current vm
patches your optimizations that allows a minor fault to be resolved even
if the swapcache is under async writeout.
The fact is that there is no difference at all between MAP_SHARED and
MAP_ANONYMOUS in terms of memory pressure, the only difference is that
with MAP_SHARED we are guaranteed that we won't run out of "swap" space.
No other differnece.
In short the same way MAP_ANON must pageout correctly, also MAP_SHARED
must swapout correctly with very vm intensive conditions.
I suggest not making differences in the algorithm (besides having to use
two different code paths, but in terms of mem pressure and minor faults
the actions should be the same, if not then one of the two is either
buggy or inferior).
