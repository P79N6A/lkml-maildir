It would be a bug, that is not what is causing the problem.
make oldconfig < /dev/null breaks on both kbuild 2.4 and 2.5, oldconfig
requires input.  If you want no prompts with oldconfig taking defaults
for new values then
  yes '' | make oldconfig (kbuild 2.4)
  make defconfig (kbuild 2.5)
I cannot reproduce Alex's problems using standard make or gmake.  It is
almost certainly a problem with his version of make or the wrapper
around it, it is introducing spurious targets.  If the problem occurs
using standard GNU make then I will look at it.
