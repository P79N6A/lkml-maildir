Security issues.  That applies for userspace as well.  Not upgrading,
or at least disabling the functionality with the security issue is
irresponsible.
Actually, this is one thing we could do to make Linux systems more
usable on low spec hardware - fix all the security issues in ancient
versions of the kernel and popular userspace applications.

No, 2.6 should run on a 4MB 386 with no significant performance
penalty against 2.0, in my opinion.

Why not?

I agree, error codes would be nice, but this discussion has come up
before and I doubt they will ever get in to mainline.

Not really going to help much, in my opinion, it'll just add overhead.
