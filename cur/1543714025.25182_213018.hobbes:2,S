I was thinking that perhaps this call was in a certain critical
performance path of the O(1) scheduler.
Turned out it wasn't - see further Nick Piggin's followups to this
same thread.
My latest bitmap/cpumask patch moves this out of line, for ia64.
The other arch's that use this large find_next_bit() code might
want to move it out too.
