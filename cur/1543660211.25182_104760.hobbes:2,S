linux.bkbits.net:8080/linux-2.5 is accessible for all, even people
developing another SCM. All incremental changes can be found there
again without any licensing issues.
And btw. no-one forces people to use BK to develop the kernel.
And the kernel is available as patches on kernel.org.
So what is the point of this thread?
