Yup, there has been some interaction in the past and I suggest that the
Stanford CHECKER people be subscribed to the kernel-janitors list or the
other way around, so that we can work more closely.
One thing is to find error patterns, and this is being done by the janitor
team and by any other interested people, other point is to go thru the
kernel sources and see where the patterns appear, and here the CHECKER is a
very important player if not the most important, and the other is to fix
the problems found, where active maintainers should do the work, despite
the fact that some are supposedly maintained (listed in MAINTAINERS or in
the kernel sources) some aren't, there are even drivers listed as
maintained but the maintainers don't even have the hardware anymore, and
new maintainers should appear or the janitors should do the work.
