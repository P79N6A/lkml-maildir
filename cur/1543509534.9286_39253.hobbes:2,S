Some more datapoints from my PC at work which is a 350 MHz Pentium II and
our new SGI Origin 200 with 4 225 MHz R10000 processors.
Linux kernel is stock redhat 2.2.5-22
IRIX kernel is Irix 6.5.5
My little test program gives me for the Intel PC an average of approx. 3.9
microsec for normal signals and 5.1 microsec for rt queued signals.
Delta is approx. 1.2 microsecs
For our expensive Origin 200 the following numbers are measured:
normal signals: 27 microsec
rt signals:     28 microsec
Delta is approx 1 microsecs
Well what can I say...
Linux is fast. (may not come as a shock to most of you :-)
Can we spare 1.2 microsec for a feature on modern h/w?
	Robert
