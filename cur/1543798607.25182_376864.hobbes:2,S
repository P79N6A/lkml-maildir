What CPU is used there? I guess it's not 144 MHz ARM ;-)

Oh BTW... I'm experiencing constant problems with root filesystem over 
NFS over usbnet on my target
I'm getting "server not responding, still trying" error whenever the 
system (208-MHz ARM926 board) is under heavy load.
I think it may well be related to the thing we discuss.
