... in general.
And on the machines where it works (le machines), I'd certainly expect  
those conversion functions to be trivially eliminated by the compiler (ie,  
they're either trivial macros or trivial inline functions).

Well, these day, optimizers often can recognize the usual endianness  
conversion idioms, so the compiler still gets a chance at inserting your  
load-with-swap or whatever.
