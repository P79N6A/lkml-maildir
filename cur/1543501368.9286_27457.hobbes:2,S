I'm trying to build a kernel module in C++. This code includes some of
the linux kernel header files, and unfortunately does not compile with
recent versions of the kernel. The code is not my own - I have
inherited it from someone else - but I am assured that it used to
compile.
The error I get has to do with include/linux/signal.h under the kernel
source tree: the functions siginitset and siginitsetinv both contain
switch statements which are invalid C++ syntax (and in fact, are
invalid in C, but which make use of a gcc extension). Specifically,
the last label ("case 1:") in these statements should be followed by a
semicolon.
I have just subscribed to the linux-kernel mailing list, but I am not
sure I will get your responses, so please cc any discussion of this to
my address.
Thanks,
