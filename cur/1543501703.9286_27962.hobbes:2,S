Ive been through and squashed those that are in main code paths and are
thus clearly potential problems, as well as several that are wildly improbable
events but since they are GFP_ATOMIC ought to be fixed.
I've left a collection of "boot time cannot occur" entries, and the network
drivers on the whole as the net driver init code needs fixing anyway as a 
whole item.
