Alexander, I face following warning if I build my kernel without HIGHMEM
support. Fianally linker fails in the end.
CC      kernel/kexec.o
kernel/kexec.c: In function `kexec_should_crash':
kernel/kexec.c:37: warning: implicit declaration of function `in_interrupt'
If I include HIGHMEM support, it compiles fine.
You might have to include include/linux/hardirq.h in kexec.c to 
resolve the problem.
Thanks
Vivek
