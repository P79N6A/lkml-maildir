Indeed, this is how it was supposed to work.
	Note that it is possible to make stop_machine() an even larger hammer,
by scheduler mods to flush all the preempted tasks.  This would drop the
requirement for preempt_disable().
But cute as that would be, I've been waiting until someone demonstrates
an actual need...
