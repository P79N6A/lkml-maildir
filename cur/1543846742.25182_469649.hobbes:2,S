In other words, if we really have had the code to handle both interfaces 
in the kernel, I vote for just reverting the patch that "fixed" it to just 
one.
But I suspect that's not what you're really saying. I think you're saying 
is that we've had two different interfaces for _different_ chips, and that 
some user-space tools have supported both. And since clearly the distros 
haven't updated to those tools yet (or this wouldn't be an issue), we 
still want to avoid a flag-day, and wait until they have done so.
