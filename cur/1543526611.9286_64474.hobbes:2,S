The time to build a initrd is a fraction of the time you need to compile a
kernel.

If you don't plan ahead, you pay the price. Big news.

OK.

It would be _less_ flexible, and much more complex. initrd can contain
anything at all, a copy of netscape if you want to. A first stage
bootloader that passes options to the kernel means that only options planed
ahead are available. Plus there are now two independent ways of setting
this stuff; the options way will be less tested, and quickly fall into
disrepair. Back at square one, with a bloated kernel and unneeded booting
complexity.
