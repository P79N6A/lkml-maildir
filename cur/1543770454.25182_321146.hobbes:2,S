Then there needs to be some mechanism to handle it, either in X or the
kernel.  Other OSes do not require you to turn off the screensaver to
avoid a DoS - they do the obvious thing and run the screensaver at the
lowest priority.
The problem may be software 3D rendering (I did not have the VIA driver
enabled as I did not realize it was in the kernel yet).   Maybe the X
server should do the work in a low priority thread.  But it sure
shouldn't DoS the system.  Other OSes do not have this problem.
