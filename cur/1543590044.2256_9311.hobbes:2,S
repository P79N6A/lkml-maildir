Hi,
Some times ago I configured several Linux boxes to accept console on serial.
Nothing new, but could some one help me with pin assignments for 
a serial cable DB9-female to DB9-female. I've lost this file
and I need help to connect to one of this box.
I didn't remember even if is a simple null modem cable.
Thank you in advance,
