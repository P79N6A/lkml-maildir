Right, but I was answering his question about whether or not there was a place 
to stick his 'vga' control file on a per-domain basis.  There would be if the 
layout was something like this:
/sys/devices/pciDDDD/BB/SS.F/foo
rather than the current
/sys/devices/pciDDDD:BB/DDDD:BB:SS.F/foo

I'm actually ok with a system wide vga arbitration driver, assuming that we'll 
never have to worry about the scalability of stuff that wants to do legacy
