Subject: [PATCH -mm] Fix /proc/slab_allocators re seq_list_next() conversion
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/6/4/89

Wrong pointer was used as kmem_cache pointer.
[Here /proc/slab_allocators appears as empty file, but it's just me, probably]
