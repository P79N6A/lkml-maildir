The protocol is, and always has been
	lock_page()
	set_page_writeback();
	start-io
	unlock_page();
end_io:
	end_page_writeback()
and there are places in the VM which rely upon some or all of that.  I'd
need to go on a big hunt to remember where they are.  One of them is
invalidate_inode_pages2(), as you've just discovered.

Well the VM uses lock_page() for this synchronisation.  If NFS has gone and
decided not to do that then we'll need to either
a) Make NFS follow the protocol or
b) Put stuff in NFS to allow the VM to work correctly (until we change it) or
c) Put very-clearly-commented NFS exception code into the VM.
