Yes, but why does the kernel not send out the queue?(I don't know if the queue
is empty or full when my sendto stops)
Without MSG_DONTWAIT, sendto waits endlessly. But on what?
Normally the kernel should put the queued packets on the line and accept new
ones, or did I misunderstand this?
My program sends out many udp packets, and sometimes it just stops until the
kernel receives a network packet or I access the local network(with arp
command).
So if I run arp in an endless loop(while :; do arp; done), sendto runs smooth.
For me it smells like a bug ;)
