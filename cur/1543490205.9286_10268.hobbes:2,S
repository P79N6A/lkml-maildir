| Every once in a while my system looses 30 msec. How comes?

| Answer
| You are running Linux; you are using automatic module loading using
| /sbin/kerneld. During module loading the kernel does not take good
| care of the time. If you can spare the memory, please load the
| modules at boot time.

Actually, I found that the automatic "rmmod -a" done every minute or so on
Red Hat systems had an even bigger effect on drift --- even if there weren't
any modules to be unloaded.  (Sadly, building a static kernel and killing the 
module stuff didn't make it entirely stable.)

     We are Linux. Resistance is an indication that you missed the point.
