I ask you some questions.
You make software. You have a business model, to make money, where you
sell software. The software that you sell is NOT Free. Imagine, now,
that you change the business model, continuing to make money, where the
software you produce is Free. Wouldn't it be better?
In the end, the fundamental question is: Wouldn't it be a better world
if all software was Free and people continued to make money in other
ways? You know the advantages and disadvantages of Free Software, so
answer this question and you will understand my point of view.
Of course, I understand your point of view too. You think you can't make
money any other way other than sell non-Free Software. But maybe, just
maybe, that is possible, even for those that make games and don't see
any other possibility.
You understand now why I say that Free Software is good and non-Free
Software is bad?
I'm a pacifist. If I where called to fight, I would not do it. I would
not fight for my country, because I don't believe in war, no matter
what. I believe no one should fight. You may say it is a bad position:
my country can be invaded, etc. and I must defende it. I say NO, I WILL
NOT FIGHT. I am convicted that no one should fight and I tell every body
they should not fight. I tell you: Don't fight. I believe the world
would be better if there were no wars. Most people would probably say
that I'm a fool, or maybe a wimp, but that is my philosophy.
The same with Free Software. I believe in Free Software, I think that
every body should make their software Free. Maybe I'm just an asshole,
but if I am, at least, I'm an asshole with convictions. And I'm
convinced that the world would be a better place if ALL software was
Free Software.
