So do so. That's a hardware/driver issue. If the hardware is broken, put
a workaround in the driver for that hardware (make the driver persistent,
as Horst suggested, perhaps). Don't kludge the kernel to mask hardware
bugs.

Yippee. As we all know, implementing GUI volume controls
and putting the slider in the right place is a kernel function,
and nothing to do with userspace...
If you want your volume control applet to be able to read the
current volume settings, even on buggy hardware which can't
really do that, put the kludge in userspace. Or if you really want,
put it in your driver for buggy hardware, in the way Horst suggested.

No it cannot. The desired levels have not been defined: there are no
desired levels to determine! Don't tamper with settings you don't need
to.

The right thing in this context is not to screw with hardware settings
unless and until it is given settings to set. Do not set values arbitrarily:
set only the values you are explicitly given. Anything else is simply
a bug in your driver.
