Hello!

Excellent! This puzzle bedevils me for year or so...
And nobody was able to give any intelligible answer 8)
Let me one question to complete the picture: the same bit
of tr source address is TR_RII. Is it true? Do another magic
bits exist?
Also, could you write tr_header_parse routine to fetch
source address? (Look at eth_header_parse)
BTW, could you send me piece of "tcpdump -p -e" with samples
of multicast packets originated by another hosts?

I do not understand this. Even if it is misinterpreted, neigh table
overflow is not explained yet.
