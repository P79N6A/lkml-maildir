Hi,
i am currently in the process of porting my serial driver for
this board
02:03.0 Communication controller: PLX Technology, Inc. 9060SD (rev 02)
	Subsystem: Aurora Technologies, Inc. Aries 16000P
	Flags: medium devsel, IRQ 6063168
	Memory at fffff9ff00002000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable)
	I/O ports at 2000400
	Memory at fffff9ff00004000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable)
	Expansion ROM at 0000000000008000 [disabled]
to sparc64 - Basically the thing compiles but in the first
round i found a lot 32Bitisms for addresses which is *aehm* wrong.
But now it seems i am running into the beloved ioremap vs whatever
problem. I read IO-remap in the Documentation area and i think i did it
right but i get an 
data_access_exception: Shit SFSR[000000000088100d] SFAR[000001ff00004040], going.
Which is the reset routing trying to write a single byte with writeb.
Here the important parts ..
In the find_card i do this ..
		[...]
		cd1865_base=ioremap(pdev->base_address[2] &
									PCI_BASE_ADDRESS_MEM_MASK,
							AA_CHIP_PCI_SIZE);
While resetting the first writeb (ba contains cd1865_base) 
		[...]
        /* Set GSVR to 0x0 */
        writeb(0x00, ba + CD1865_GSVR);
This is all Kernel 2.2.17
