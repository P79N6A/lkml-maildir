Interesting material. Rate-based clocking with TCP and network polling
may be somewhat controversial, but I can see good uses for certain short
delays where hardware lacks the right interrupt capabilities (e.g. we
have now ~200 mdelays and ~1300 udelays in the kernel - should be a
great homework assignment for a large CS class to comb through that ;-),
and for traffic shaping (i.e. rate-based clocking with a configured
rate).
Do you plan to port and evaluate soft timers also to/on Linux ?
