I've now tried the most conservative settings available. The 32 bit
kernel now hangs after about 150000 Iterations (compared to about 16000
before) but the 64 bit kernel still hangs after about 5000.
After a ~12 hour memtest86 run memtest86 crashed (!), filling the
console with some garbage characters and then hanging.
This is driving me crazy.
Imo memtest86 should not hang onless something screws up the memory area
it is loaded into.
I've also tried the newest beta bios for the board now, didnt change
anything.
kind regards Philip
