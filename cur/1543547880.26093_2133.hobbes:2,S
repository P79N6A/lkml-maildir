If you'd read what I wrote in it's entirety, you'd know that I'm very well
aware of this perspective.  I don't need to have the volumes of idiocy
which come out of some management pointed out to me.  At the same time my
entire point was that I think there's some valid business concerns that
they have /after/ removing all the crap, and that I wouldn't be surprised
if the market went against linux and in favor of other operating systems
that addressed them.
And if you think I don't understand what Linux wrote you are very wrong.  
Perhaps to put a better spin on things what I should state is that I
understand what Linus is trying to do, and I'm merely pointing out that
he's really not filling the gap of supplying an IT-friendly open source
OS.  He's providing an OS for developers.  Cool.  Fine.  No worries.  But
that does leave a void, in my opinion.  Perhaps disributions adding
patches to the kernel will fill this void, but I tend to think it wont
scale in the end.  We'll either see forking, see another OS like FreeBSD
fill the void, or (worst case) Solaris.
I don't know why this viewpoint creates such hostile responses from some
people.  I'm pointing out that Linux is not everything for everyone.  
Heresy.
