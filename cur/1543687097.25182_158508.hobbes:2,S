Its done this way because this is really how the priorities are
enforced. With some complicated exceptions, every task will be
allowed to complete 1 timeslice before any task completes 2
(assuming they don't block).
So higher priority tasks need bigger timeslices.

Among other things, yes, I think this is a good idea too. I'll be
addressing both these issues in my scheduler fork.
I do have dynamic timeslices, but currently high priority tasks
still get big timeslices.
