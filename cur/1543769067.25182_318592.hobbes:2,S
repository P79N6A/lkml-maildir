I believe you (SGI) make one ;-) Anywhere where you have large gaps in
the physical address range within a node, this is what you really need.
Except ia64 has this wierd virtual mem_map thing that can go away once
we have sparsemem.

The end point of where we're getting to is 1 node = 1 pgdat (which we can
then rename to struct node or something). All this confusing mess of 
config options is just a migration path, which I'll leave it to Andy to
explain ;-)

No, it's a discontigmem screwup. Currently a pgdat represents 2 different
scenarios: 
(1) physically discontiguous memory chunk.
(2) a NUMA node.
I don't think we support both at the same time with the old code. So it
seems to me like your numa aware slab code (which I'm still intending to
go read, but haven't yet) is only interested in real nodes. Logically
speaking, that would be CONFIG_NUMA. The current transition config options
are a bit of a mess ... Andy, I presume CONFIG_NEED_MULTIPLE_NODES is
really CONFIG_NEED_MULTIPLE_PGDATS ?
