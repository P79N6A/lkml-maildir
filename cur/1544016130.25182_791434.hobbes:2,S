So do you program one channel of the DMA engine from the host side and
another channel from the guest side?
I tried to avoid having the host program the DMA controller at all.
Using the DMAEngine API on the guest did better than I could achieve by
programming the registers manually. I didn't use chaining or any of the
fancier features in my tests, though.
