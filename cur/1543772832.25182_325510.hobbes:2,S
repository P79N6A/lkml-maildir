Yes, and couldn't figure out how they were generated, newbie here. I
read somewhere the character tables get generated automatically from a
UTF8 reference, but can't find that article now.
I am ready to invest time in trying to create (shudder) the module and
testing if it fixes the problem I describe, if someone could give me a
pointer.
Thanks.
