It has been 40 hours since my post about cp -a hanging on my drive. I
haven't gotten a response, and I assume based on the traffic on this list, I
am not going to get one. So I really could use some help, and if anyone can
help me to get this hard disk to work I would appreiciate it. If there is
another list I can try for more help please let me know. To sum up, I cp -a
hangs at random times. ps shows wait_on_buffer on etx3/ get_grequest after I
reformatted the partitions to ext2. One time the entire system froze. There
are no errors in any logs. The hd is a Maxtor 91360U4 with 13g. Kernel is
2.4-18. Red Hat 8.0.
The drive worked well on a mac just a few days ago. Formated it for Windows
and tested copying many files and had no problems. Scandisk reports no
problems. So it seems to me to be a problem with linux, but I couldn't begin
to figure what I should do.
Thanks,
Elie.
