Unfortunately I don't think that that is an option; it would defeat
the purpose of using Linux as a replacement for higher-end OSes that
do have the speed.  With the speed of most of today's Linux-supported
platforms, we can easily justify the use of Linux because the speed is
comparrible (or even better) than higher-cost workstations.  AFS is
"slow", even when it's in the kernel.  I don't even want to think
about how gawdawful slow it would be elsewhere (I've never used Arla,
so I don't know exactly how slow that is).  I do believe that the
speed hit would bring to question the benefits of moving to Linux as a
reasonable platform.
So, I think the answer is "yes, we need the speed" and "no, we cannot
afford to lose a _lot_ of speed."
Thanks!
