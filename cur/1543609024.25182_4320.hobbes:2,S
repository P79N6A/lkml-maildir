Actually this last part is wrong, isn't it ? jiffies <= start + HZ is also
a correct way to do it, since start+HZ will overflow to the current value
of
jiffies when HZ time elapses. So the above two statements are IDENTICAL. I
agree with the rest of the statements, and especially that you don't need
to worry about wrapping using unsigned numbers.
