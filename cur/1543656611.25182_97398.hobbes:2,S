Curious why you need to drop max_timeslice, too.  Did you do that
_before_ changing the interactivity estimator?  Dropping max_timeslice
closer to min_timeslice would do away with a lot of effect of the
interactivity estimator, since bonuses and penalties would be less
apparent.
There would still be (a) the improved priority given to interactive
processes and (b) the reinsertion into the active away done to
interactive processes.
Setting prio_bonus_ratio to zero would finish off (a) and (b).  It would
also accomplish the effect of setting max_timeslice low, without
actually doing it.
Thus, can you try putting max_timeslice back to 300?  You would never
actually use that range, mind you, except for niced/real-time
processes.  But at least then the default timeslice would be a saner
100ms.

I am glad sched-tune helped identify and fix the issue.  I would have no
problem merging this to Linus.  I actually have a 2.5.52 patch out which
is a bit cleaner - it removes the defines completely and uses the new
variables.  More proper for the long term.  Feel free to push what you
have, too.
But that in no way precludes not fixing what we have, because good
algorithms should not require tuning for common cases.  Period.
