One problem I ran into considering 'char *volatile' was this one: the
compiler is supposed to disable certain optimizations involving
registerization and such, but isn't it still allowed to do constant
folding?  That would eliminate the pointer from the intermediate code
altogether, and so the volatile qualifier would be quickly forgotten.  
No fixo breako.
Nothing's taking the pointer's address, so the compiler _will_ be able 
to prove that (in a sensible universe) no other thread, interrupt, 
kernel code or Angered Rain God will be able to find our pointer--much 
less change it.
