let me first try to show what functionality we need...
The ehca userspace driver needs 2 types of kernel/hw memory mapped into
userspace,
1) 4k pages provided by HW, one per queue, mostly used for signalling
   from userspace to hardware that new send/receive/poll queue entries are
   available. In kernel that's the typical candidate for ioremap.
   For these areas we use ehca_mmap_register to do the actual mapping into
   a mm
2) the actual queue memory itself, which has been allocated by
   get_zeroed_page(GPF_KERNEL). These pages need to be written by userspace
and
   read by the ehca, or the other way around
   For these areas we use ehca_mmap_nopage to do the mapping into
   a mm
let me try to explain what we thought this code should do....

this is what a anonymous mapping request from userspace would do.

unfortunately you don't get back a vma ...
...but you need the vma for installing nopage handlers
therefore:

...that should be straight forward file mmap code
The memory we're using shouldn't be handled by copy on write,
should not be swapped, its used by DMA from the hardware.
And it shouldn't get merged
In case of a fork we would like to get a pagefault in the new process if
he accesses this queue and a unchanged forking process.
Is VM_RESERVED ok for that type of vma?

these mappings occur exactly when the user calls create_qp and create_cq,
an ib user actually "wants" to have these queues in its adress space.
We though that the closest we could get to a mmap(NULL,...) from userspace.

could you explain where the race comes in?
How would that be different from a user calling mmap?

We want to map bus adresses into userspace in this case...
...just as mmap from userspace... ?

Maybe we shouldn't have looked at that driver how to use mmap
within the kernel while examining HOW to implement what we needed.
What other methods would you suggest?
Is there already a "proper" usage pattern for what we need in the
kernel?
