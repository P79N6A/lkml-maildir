I don't see the large ifdefs you're referring to in -mm's
kernel/sched.c.

I don't see the hooks you're referring to in the -mm scheduler.

	The OLS2004 slides are roughly 1 year old. Have you looked at more
recent benchmarks posted on CKRM-Tech around April 15th 2005? They
should be available in the CKRM-Tech archives on SourceForge at
http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=7025751&forum_id=35191
(OLS 2004 Slide 24 of
http://ckrm.sourceforge.net/downloads/ckrm-ols04-slides.pdf
 )
	The OLS slide indicates that the overhead is generally less than
0.5usec compared to a total context switch time of anywhere from 2 to
5.5usec. There appears to be little difference in scalability since the
overhead appears to oscillate around a constant.

	The Rule-Based Classification Engine (RBCE) makes CKRM useful without
middleware. It uses a table of rules to classify tasks. For example
rules that would classify shells:
echo 'path=/bin/bash,class=/rcfs/taskclass/shells' > /rcfs/ce/rules/classify_bash_shells
echo 'path=/bin/tcsh,class=/rcfs/taskclass/shells' > /rcfs/ce/rules/classify_tcsh_shells
..
And class shares would control the fork rate of those shells:
echo 'res=numtasks,forkrate=10000,forkrate_interval=1' > '/rcfs/taskclass/config'
echo 'res=numtasks,guarantee=1000,limit=5000' > '/rcfs/taskclass/shells'
No middleware necessary.

	The choice of algorithm is entirely up to the scheduler, memory
allocator, etc. CKRM currently provides an interface for reading share
values and does not impose any meaning on those shares -- that is the
role of the scheduler.

	Generic and abstract names are appropriate for infrastructure that is
not tied to hardware. If you could be more specific I'd be able to
respond in less general and abstract terms.

I haven't seen this limitation in the CKRM patches that went into -mm
and I'd like to look into this. Where did you see this limit?
