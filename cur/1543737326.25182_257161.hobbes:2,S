A minimal quote from your website :-)
"CpuMemSets provides a new Linux kernel facility that enables system 
services and applications to specify on which CPUs they may be 
scheduled, and from which nodes they may allocate memory."
Since I have addressed the cpu section it seems obvious that
in order to ISOLATE different workloads, you associate them onto
non-overlapping cpusets, thus technically they are physically isolated
from each other on said chosen CPUs.
Given that cpuset hierarchies translate into cpu-affinity masks,
this desired isolation can result in lost cycles globally.
I believe this to be orthogonal to share settings. To me both
are extremely desirable features.
I also pointed out that if you separate mechanism from API, it
is possible to move the CPU set API under the CKRM framework.
I have not thought about the memory aspect.
