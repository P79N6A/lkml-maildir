Hello.
There was a discussion of how to optimize Linux's swap
partition on slashdot [www.slashdot.org] not that long
ago.
I have read most of the messages in the discussion queue,
I think I have learned something from those postings,
but I do have several questions to ask you all.
	Hope this is the right place to ask. If not, please
forgive me.
From the Slashdot postings, there were mentions of swap-files
and swap-partitions.
Let's say I have 4 harddisks (not partition, physically
harddisks) in my machine.
	Disk A is a 3 GB ide
	Disk B is a 2 GB ide
	Disk C is a 6 GB scsi
	Disk D is a 3 GB scsi
Should I set up swap-areas on each of the disks? 
	And if so, do I use swap-file or swap-partition?
	What is the performance difference between swap-file
and swap-partition?
And in the Slashdot discussions, there were mentioned
about positioning swap-partition in specific areas of
the disk to optimize diskhead read/write action.
	Some says putting swap-partitions in the outter-rings
of the disks,
	some says inner-rings, while others say somewhere in
the middle.
I am confused.
	Which one is correct?
Does it make much differences in positioning the disk-partitions
in the inner-, middle-, or outer-rings of the disk?
There were also talks of how large the swap-areas (swap-files
or swap-partitions) should one provide.
	Some said the size of the swap-areas depend on the RAM
size.
	Others said it depended on how many applications you
use.
My question about it is:
	How should I figure out how large should I make the
swap-area on the disks?
	Is there a formula of sort to give some estimation?
I am sorry if these questions were asked before, and
I apologize again if this is not the proper forum to
ask these questions.
	But in any case, if you have any answer, please cc.
a copy of your answer to me at linuxkernel@newmail.net
please.
Before I forget, my machine is an Intel PIII 550, with
128M of RAM, and I do use a lot of applications that
consume a lot of RAM space.
Thanks a bunch for any help I can get.
Best regards,
Sean
