Hi Alan,
This patch, against patch-2.5.44-ac4, cleans up the m68knommu
and v850 architecture support.
http://www.uclinux.org/pub/uClinux/uClinux-2.5.x/linux-2.5.44-ac4-uc2.patch.gz
It is sorta big. But there is not really anything new in it. Mostly
it is an organizational change of files, and a rewrite of the arch
Makefiles. All much cleaner now.
Regards
Greg
