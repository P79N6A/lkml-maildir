While this is OK in mono-threaded code, it introduces a race condition in
multi-threaded code. The code above tried to acquire a lock, and eax was
set to 1 if it succeeded. And whatever the result, all threads still
happily modify the shared memory area (acquires_count). So the classical
case where two threads perform the same operation at the same time ends
up with a random value in acquires_count.

Even with a CMOV, it's the memory write which should not be performed
if the lock was not acquired.

100% agree.
What would really be needed is an attribute around conditions to
indicate whether they *may* be optimized or not. Something similar
to the likely/unlikely we currently use, we could have something
like __attribute__((unsafe_cond(cond))). I think that it could still
optimize by default but let the user explicitly state that he is
playing with thread-unsafe code. As you pointed out, you did not
find any such mis-optimization in the kernel, which means that it
does not hit too often. That's the reason why I'd let the user be
careful.
