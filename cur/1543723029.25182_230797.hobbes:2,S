Yes, but this is the most reliable way to do your large allocation.
This reminds me that it would be handy to have a "bootmem=" cmdline
parameter.
Alternatively, set CONFIG_FORCE_MAX_ZONEORDER to an order that allows
your huge allocation using __get_free_pages().  However, there's no
guarantees it will succeed after things are fragmented.

Yes.  It's going to call pci_assign_resource() which uses
PCIBIOS_MIN_[IO|MEM] to determine the allowed range of resource
assignment for a given resource type.  On i386, PCIBIOS_MIN_MEM
is defined as pci_mem_start. In arch/i386/setup.c this is configured as:
    if (low_mem_size > pci_mem_start)
        pci_mem_start = low_mem_size;
So you can see that using "mem=" isn't compatible with the assignment
methodology.
