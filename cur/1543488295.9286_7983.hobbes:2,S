What is the best Kernel version to be running right now
I am currently running 2.0.36 
I dont have both cpus showing up in xosview or in top
current configuration is very stable though
I just kept hearing too many bad things about the latest kernal ver.
so I havent upgraded yet 
If I should upgrade whats the best way and where you I download it?
will it configure smp or do I have to change the MakeFile again?
also are there any problems in it with the TYAN tiger 100BX
dual 350 
matrox mill II
okay thanx
