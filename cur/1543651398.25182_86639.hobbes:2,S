In reiser4 allocation of disk space is delayed to transaction commit. It
is not possible to estimate precisely amount of disk space that will be
allocated during commit, and hence statfs(2) results are not updated
until one does sync(2) (forcing commit) or transaction is committed due
to age (10 minutes by default).
