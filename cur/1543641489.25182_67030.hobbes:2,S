Frankly, I don't know. The behaviour of the BIOS sure is bad,
but I don't know the APM specifications, so the BIOS might still
be operating within these limits. Good luck though for getting a
better BIOS from Dell. If you have any success, please let me know.
I doubt that this can be fixed in the kernel. If the kernel enables
interrupts during APM calls but the BIOS still turns them off, what
should the kernel do about this? Well, there still exists the possibilty
that the kernel's method for enabling interrupts during APM calls is
flawed in some way, or doesn't work with certain BIOSes. In this case,
it might be possible to fix it in the kernel.
Cheers,
Frank
