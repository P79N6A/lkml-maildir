yes, user space programs put arguments in registers (ebx, ecx, edx...) but
see what happens later...
1) user space programs do something like this:
mov	$SYSCALLNUMER, %eax
mov	$ARG1, %ebx
mov	$ARG2, %ecx
...
int	$0x80	------ go to kernel syscall handler --->
---> arch(i386/kernel/entry.S:
....
	# system call handler stub
ENTRY(system_call)
	pushl %eax			# save orig_eax
	SAVE_ALL
	GET_THREAD_INFO(%ebp)
					# system call tracing in operation
	/* Note, _TIF_SECCOMP is bit number 8, and so it needs testw and not testb
*/	testw
$(_TIF_SYSCALL_TRACE|_TIF_SYSCALL_AUDIT|_TIF_SECCOMP),TI_flags(%ebp)	jnz
syscall_trace_entry	cmpl $(nr_syscalls), %eax
	jae syscall_badsys
syscall_call:
	call *sys_call_table(,%eax,4)
	movl %eax,EAX(%esp)		# store the return value
...
notice just these 2 things:
1) SAVE_ALL  ---> it's a MACRO that do this:
#define SAVE_ALL \
	cld; \
	pushl %es; \
	pushl %ds; \
	pushl %eax; \
	pushl %ebp; \
	pushl %edi; \
	pushl %esi; \			....
	pushl %edx; \			> ARG3 <
	pushl %ecx; \			> ARG2 <
	pushl %ebx; \			> ARG1 <
	movl $(__USER_DS), %edx; \
	movl %edx, %ds; \
	movl %edx, %es;
2) call *sys_call_table(,%eax,4)
this calls the "C" system call function
So, since the arguments are passed on the stack (see SAVE_ALL) the "C"
function MUST take them from the stack.

#define asmlinkage CPP_ASMLINKAGE __attribute__((regparm(0)))
SEE "__attribute__((regparm(0)))"... it tells GCC that the arguments are on
the STACK even if "-mregparm=NUMER" option is used.
