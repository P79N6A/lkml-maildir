I've read this statement multiple times on lkml, from Linus
and others. And you won't believe it: I'm all for a separation
of driver API includes and kernel includes.

IMHO the problem is that Linux 2.6.0 is about to be released with some
broken driver API include files, and without a clear policy how driver
authors, glibc and distribution maintainers and should handle
the situation in a consistent way.
