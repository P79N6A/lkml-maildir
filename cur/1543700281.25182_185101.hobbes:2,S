Subject: PROBLEM: Compiler error for 2.6.0 in fs/proc/array.c

Compiler error for 2.6.0 in fs/proc/array.c with gcc-2.95 and binutils
2.13.
I received the following error while trying to compile the new 2.6.0
(no -test anything) on my RH 7.3 box.  I have gcc version 2.95.3
installed in addion to the yuckie 2.96 from RH.  While search the
mailing list archives, I found some patches for the -test7 and/or
-test8 series that claim they fix a gcc 2.96 bug.  I applied the patch
on the original 2.6.0 source tree and the compile went through.  The
patch I'm talking about involved making the tty_nr variable into a
volatile int in the file fs/proc/array.c line number 298.  There are
other patches that attempt to break up the huge sprintf() statement on
line 347 into smaller chucks.  I'm not sure which would be preferable
to the maintainer.
The point of this email is to hopefully bring to your attention a
compilation bug in the 2.6.0 source.  If I made a mistake and don't
have my environment set up correctly, please accept my appologies.
Hope this helps,
-kevin
