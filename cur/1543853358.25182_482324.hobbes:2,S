Ok.
Does the following change look fine ?
do_msgsnd() - Accepting the mtype and user space ptr to the mtext. i.e.,
long do_msgsnd(int msqid, long mtype, void __user *mtext,
		size_t msgsz, int msgflg);
and,
do_msgrcv() - accepting the kernel space data ptr to pmtype and user 
space ptr to mtext. The caller has to copy the *pmtype back to the user 
space.
i.e.,
long do_msgrcv(int msqid, long *pmtype, void __user *mtext,
                        size_t msgsz, long msgtyp, int msgflg);
or
Can we use the kernel space "struct msgbuf" instead of the mtype being 
passed explicitly.
Thanks,
Suzuki
