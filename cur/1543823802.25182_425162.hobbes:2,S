And according to the impression I've got, it should
therefore be removed, sure? :)

I see the point but not the practicle solution. request_region()
won't work as the ports are already claimed by other drivers.
Resolving this inside pcspkr.c won't help snd-pcsp, as it will
add the dependancy if some internal API is used.
The real problem is that whereever I'll solve that, this will be
a hack, because normally two drivers should not compete for the
IO resourses, disable each other, race etc.
So I give it up. I'll just disable pcspkr in the Kconfig and
whoever wants both snd-pcsp and the beeps, will need to install
the user-space daemon which uses uinput. I have yet to find such
a daemon...
