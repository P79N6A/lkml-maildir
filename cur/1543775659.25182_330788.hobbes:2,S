I recently (well about 3 weeks ago) upgraded the kernel on one of our
machines to 2.6.11.12 at the time the "latest and greatest".
However since then I've been having problems with a USB Scanner I'm
using. It seems to die after a couple of pages have been scanned with
the following message sequence in /var/log/messages:
Jul  3 13:19:22 caveman kernel: usb 3-1: device descriptor read/64,
error -19
Jul  3 13:19:22 caveman kernel: usb 3-1: USB disconnect, address 3
(note the messages either side of this happened without me doing
anything and the entry disappeared from /proc/bus/usb/003/003 and
appeared in /proc/bus/usb/003/004).

After which it doesn't appear anywhere in /proc/bus/usb
I've tried swapping usb ports - there are several on the machine.
I've tried swapping scanners (they're both Epson ones, different
models).
It seems OK with previous versions of the kernel on other machines.
I see we're now on 2.6.12.2 and there have been mods to bits of the USB
but I don't see anything directly related but I might have missed
something.
I'd be grateful for any advice you could give - thanks.
