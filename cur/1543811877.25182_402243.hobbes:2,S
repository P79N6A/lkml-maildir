Getting closer.
Without the patches:
    proc-dont-lock-task_structs-indefinitely.patch
    proc-dont-lock-task_structs-indefinitely-git-nfs-fix.patch
    proc-dont-lock-task_structs-indefinitely-cpuset-fix.patch
it boots and works (except for the /proc/*/fd/* permission
complaints I made earlier to Eric).  And I was able to run my SGI
specific application that generates the 50 such permission complaints.
With these patches, it still boots, and looks fine ... until
I fire up my SGI specific application, and then it dies.
Once it died with some complaint (lost now) from a swap
daemon.  This latest time, it died with just:
  Kernel panic - not syncing: Attempted to kill init!
So I think the above 3 patches make it easy for user space
to kill the kernel.
The SGI app is some rather largish tool used for system
monitoring and maintenance - I will have to stare at it
to reduce out any useful explanation of what it is doing
that is so painful here.
