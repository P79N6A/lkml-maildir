I believe that within the kernel, unsigned long is guaranteed to be the same
size as a pointer; so much code will break if this is not true.

I don't mind you putting the cast in, but I'd prefer the cast to be via
unsigned long, and I think it should have a comment to indicate why the extra
cast is necessary.
