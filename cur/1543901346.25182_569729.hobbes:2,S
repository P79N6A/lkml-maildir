The fact of the matter is that it really doesn't matter whether mounting
it read-only actually corrupts the data on disk or not.  Regardless, it
should not be done, because you are accessing a dirty filesystem that is
still in use, and consequently there are no guarantees that either the
metadata or the file contents are consistent.  It isn't necessary for
hibernation to be able to access mounted partitions anyway.
