i believe a network-conscious application should use MSG_MORE - that has
no system-call overhead.

i believe it should rather be a new setsockopt TCP_CORK value (or a new
setsockopt constant), not an ioctl. Eg. a value of 2 to TCP_CORK could
mean 'force packet boundary now if possible, and dont touch TCP_CORK
state'.
