You can trivially map the phys mem between 1G and 1G+256M to be in a
direct mapping between 3G+256M and 3G+512M, then you can put such 256M
at offset 1G into the ZONE_NORMAL of node-id 1 with discontigmem too.
The constraints you have on the normal memory are only two:
1) direct mapping
2) DMA
so as far as the ram is capable of 32bit DMA with pci32 and it's mapped
in the direct mapping you can put it into the normal zone. There is no
difference at all between discontimem or nonlinear in this sense.
