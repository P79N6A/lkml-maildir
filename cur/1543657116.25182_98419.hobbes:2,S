http://www.xmailserver.org/linux-patches/nio-improve.html
 is down,
and I sure could use a copy of 
http://www.xmailserver.org/linux-patches/epoll-lib-0.1.tar.gz
(And archive.org doesn't seem to have it.)
Any chance somebody could mirror that and the other key files to
http://lse.sourceforge.net/epoll/
 ?
Thanks,
Dan
