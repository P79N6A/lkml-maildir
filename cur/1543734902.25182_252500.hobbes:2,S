You can run the accounting independently at much lower frequency (10ms is
perfectly fine as 2.4 has proven - i suspect even lower would be ok too) 
IMHO it should be a sysctl so that users can do a trade off between
power consumption and accounting accuracy.
And there is one important special that doesn't need any accounting
for user space at all: the idle loop. 
It still needs some way to account interrupts, but that could be done
in do_IRQ or also do with rather low frequency.
