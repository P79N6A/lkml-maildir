Both 0xed and 0xf0 are mapped to internal functions on the AMD Elan
SC400 processor.  It is an AMD 486 based system on a chip and since AMD
just knew that it would never have a math coprocessor, they reused the
0xf0-0xf2 range for the PCMCIA controller.  I guess the AMD Elan SC500
will have similar problems.
I seem to recall that back when I was working with the Elan SC400
(sometime around 1998?) there were discussions about finding an
alternate delay port because outb to 0x80 messed up the debug port.  I
think the Elan stopped those discussions because just about every port
on the Elan was reused for some alternate purpose.
