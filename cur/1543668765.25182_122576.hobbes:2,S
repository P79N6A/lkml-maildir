Read it again, please.  Told me wehre are the ?: command.
Reason is that:
if (expr)
   var = true;
else
   var = false;
is always a bad construct.
var = expr;
is a better construct to express that meaning.
And yes, your is a variation of the same theme:
var = false;
if (expr)
   var = true;
Later, Juan "who also didn't like ?: operator"
