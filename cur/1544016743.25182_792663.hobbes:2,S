This is when things went badly enough that we remounted the filesystem
read-only.  An interesting question is whether we could have given up
much earlier.  We are reflecting the I/O errors back up to userspace,
but if we have some way of querying the block layer that the device is
*gone*, or the block layer calls some callback function that the
device is *gone*, maybe we would be better off invalidating all of the
file descriptors and then force-unmounting the filesystem right away.
It would avoid a lot of the noise in the log.

This error we've already toned down in commit 2a21e37e (merged for
2.6.29).  The problem with the log noise is that it tends to obscure
the original root cause of the filesystem getting remounted read-only.
Furthermore, the stack trace really wasn't useful.  It's not a
*critical* bug fix, per se, but it would make it a lot easier to debug
problem reports from users who are trying out ext4 with 2.6.27 and
2.6.28, so I'll try to get the -stable kernel maintainers to accept
it.
