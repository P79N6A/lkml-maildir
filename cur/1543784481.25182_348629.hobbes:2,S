The patch is totally broken and causes crash even under light load
(just found it after a lengthy binary search)

The original code does
    /* Copy section for each CPU (we discard the original) */
        size = ALIGN(__per_cpu_end - __per_cpu_start, SMP_CACHE_BYTES);
#ifdef CONFIG_MODULES
        if (size < PERCPU_ENOUGH_ROOM)
                size = PERCPU_ENOUGH_ROOM;
#endif
perhaps end-start is larger than PERCPU_ENOUGH_ROOM ? (using defconfig) 
Dropped from my tree for now.
