Yes, I have always considered this a kernel bug (introduced in 2.4.10),
but my (admittedly feeble) attempts to get it fixed were not accepted.
At one point I thought a fix went into 2.4.18-pre[12] or so, but I
guess not.  I haven't tried in a while, so maybe I should make another
attempt.
Cheers, Andreas
