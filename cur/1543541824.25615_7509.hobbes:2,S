Well, see, I *don't* think Windows "naked" is really very consistent.

Well yes, *X* has an excuse.

It's a point about design and implementation of GUI features. What to do  
about structured files (which you can't avoid anyway, starting with tar),  
and how to implement it.
To be painfully obvious, I'd trust Apple's GUI design decisions over  
Microsoft's in about 99.9% of the situations. Apple's UI designers usually  
know what they are doing; I'm yet to be convinced Microsoft *has* UI  
designers.
Oh, and note that NeXT's UI designers currently work for Apple.
OTOH, I do trust NeXT's API designers (now working for Apple) far more  
than either Microsoft's *or* old Apple's API designers.
And they seem to have decided that open(URL) is a good type of interface.
