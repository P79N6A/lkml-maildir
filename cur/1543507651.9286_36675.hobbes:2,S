This may be a reasonable compromised. Define a couple of macros to create
the name.
#define PCI_SLOT_NAME_FMT "%d:%d:%d"
#define PCI_SLOT_NAME(dev) BUS(dev), SLOT(dev), FN(dev)
  printk(KERN_WARNING PCI_SLOT_NAME_FMT " is misbehaving. It should be
punished.\n", PCI_SLOT_NAME(dev));
The only problem with this is that the argument to the second macro gets
evaluated multiple times.
This gives you consistent names without reserving a field for the name. If
you really must save those keystrokes, you could come up with shorter names
for the macros.
