Better than what was there, but I still don't like it.  A global array
of devices is just utter crap.  Every entry point from scsi already has
struct scsi_device from which we can derive the sg-specific portion easily,
and for anything else (from a quick look that seems to be only procfs
stuff which should fade out anyway) a linear search on a linked list
is okay.
btw, why are we vmalloc()ing Sg_device?
