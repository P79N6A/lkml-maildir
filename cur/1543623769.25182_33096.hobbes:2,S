Yes, I talked with Bill Abt from IBM's NPthreads package about it in 
December. Huge value as it would provide full POSIX compliants.
There are differences whether you have a 1:1 threading model or
a M:N threading model.
Eitherway this could be implemented using futexes. 
M:N is surely more tricky. The problem is that the calling process/kernel 
thread can not be blocked but has to return to user level to continue another 
user level thread. What needs to happen is something like a signaling 
mechanism.
