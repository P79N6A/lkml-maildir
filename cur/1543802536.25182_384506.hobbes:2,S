Thanks for testing and reporting - it really helps.

No significant reiser3 changes in there, so I'd be suspecting something
else has gone haywire.

Yes, that sounds like a filesystem failed while holding locks.

You mean before starting portmap?

Hard to see anything in there.  If you set CONFIG_FRAME_POINTER=y you'll
get better traces.

Please test the next Linus git tree (2.6.15-git7) and see if we've
propagated it into there too.
There's not much point in fiddling with -mm2.  If git7 is OK then please
test the next -mm and if it still fails then yes, doing a bisection would
really help.

Don't know, sorry.

Pavel, have you heard of anything like this??
