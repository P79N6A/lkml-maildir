Subject: problem with nice values and cpu consumption in 2.6.11-5

Look at this cpu usage in a two-processor machine:
  893 user1   39  19  7212 5892  492 R 99.7  1.1   3694:29 mi41
 1118 user2   25   0  155m  61m  624 R 50.0 12.3 857:54.18 b170-se.x
 1186 user3   25   0  155m  62m  640 R 50.2 12.3 103:25.22 b170-se.x
The job with nice 19 seems to be using 100% of cpu time while the
other two nice 0 jobs share a single processor with 50% only. This is
persistent, not a transient. I did a kill -STOP to the nice 19 job and
a kill -CONT, and for a while it decreased the cpu usage but later
returned to the above.
This is with kernel 2.6.11-5 and top 3.2.5. What's the reason for this
(apparent??) mis-behavior and how can I correct it? This is important
because the machine is used for number-crunching and users get really
upset when they don't get the expected share of cpu time...
