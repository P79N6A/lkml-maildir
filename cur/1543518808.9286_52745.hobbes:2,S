I'm getting the following any time I have more than one process accessing drives.
hda: status timeout: status=0xd0 { Busy }
hda: no DRQ after issuing WRITE
ide0: reset: success
It also happens with hdc.
I'm running 2.2.13 on a Pentium III 450MHz on RedHat 6.1.
Please help; I desparately hope it's not corrupting my data because of this.
