Such limitations are not acceptable.

Good point with the parsing  :)

Not one value per file ?

How about:
We keep old proc files.
For each file, we make a .directory.
For example - for /proc/meminfo, we make a /proc/.meminfo/ directory
that contains the files
 MemTotal
 MemFree
 MemShared
 etc.
cat /proc/.meminfo/MemTotal gives you
"u32:KB:513276"
The kernel code for printing this is something like
 sprintf(..., "%s:%s:%u", DPI_T_U32, DPI_U_KB, i.memtotal);
The types and the units are necessary. But furthermore we do not
want various developers to be using different ways of writing the
types and units (KB vs. kB, vs. KiB).  Defines will ensure that
(if they are used - but they lend themselves to being used), and
once a new define is introduced it is fairly easy to document and
export to userland.
Not only does this format tell us exactly what's in the file (and
therefore how we should parse it), it also defines what we can write
to it (assuming we write the same types as we read - but that's a
reasonable assumption I suppose).
Problem:  Could it be made simpler to parse from scripting languages,
without making it less elegant to parse in plain C ?
If the values is a string, the string will begin after the second
semicolon (safe, since no type or unit can contain a colon and won't
have to, ever), and ends at the end of the file.  Voila, any character can be
in the string value.
And Al gets his #%^# text files   ;)
