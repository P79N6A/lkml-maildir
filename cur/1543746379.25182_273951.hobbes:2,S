If you'll be exporting via. NFS, it seems that there are still problems
with XFS+NFS.
With SMP, what I see is that sometimes a directory might decide that
it's a file - but I can't delete it, becuase it isn't 'empty' (it's
still somehow a directory).  Waiting a day or two, the system will
change its mind back to letting the directory be a directory. Sometimes
modes will be fscked up as well - a regular file can change owner, or it
can change modes from '-rw-rw---' to '?---------'.    Weird stuff, no
way to reproduce it reliably.
With UP, I know someone who's seeing stale handles reported by the NFS
server. The only known workaround is to stat the directories in question
on the *server* side - a little bash with 'while true; sleep 5; ls -l
/directory; do' will do the trick.
All of what I describe here are production environments - so it sucks to
have that kind of problems.  Some of it can be reproduced (the stale
handle errors), and some of it can't.
I guess the good news would be, that I don't know of any problems with
XFS+LVM+MD if you do not export the FS via. NFS    :)
That is, if you run 2.6.9.  Any earlier kernel will b0rk your XFS under
load.
