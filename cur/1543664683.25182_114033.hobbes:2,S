Not sure I follow all of your story but I can confirm that hdparm -u1
successfully gets me to the kernel panic due to highmem support still
lacking -- i.e. way beyond the BUG_ON() I've been hitting. So it looks
like you found a good work-around.
FWIW I'm using reiserfs, too. Two harddisks, ALi chipset.
