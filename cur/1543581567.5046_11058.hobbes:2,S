This should be all covered extensively in the reiserfs FAQ and list archives, 
here a last time:
It only applies to knfsd, but unfsd unfortunately has different problems
with reiserfs. It makes assumptions about the inode space by the underlying
filesystem by assuming that it can encode a dev_t in upper bits. Reiserfs
unlike ext2 periodically cycles through the full 31bit of inode values, and
after some weeks on a busy file system unfsd starts to complain about 
conflicts. There is a patch at ftp.suse.com:/pub/people/ak/nfs/unfsd*
that works around the problem when you specify --no-cross-mounts (but 
you cannot export trees of multiple file systems then with a single mount
anymore) 
Please also note that the patch also adds a rather obscure bug, which triggers
very seldom (patch partly exists, but not really tested yet)
Another alternative is to use knfsd with Chris Mason's 2.4 knfsd patches.
