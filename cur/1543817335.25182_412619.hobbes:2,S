No, not the memory ordering semantics you are thinking about.  It just tell
compiler not to be over smart and schedule a load operation above that point
Intel compiler is good at schedule memory load way ahead of its use to hide
memory latency. gcc probably does that too, I'm not 100% sure. This prevents
the compiler to schedule load before that line.
