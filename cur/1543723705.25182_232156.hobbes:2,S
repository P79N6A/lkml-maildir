Hi,
	I try to understand how readdir process works and I can't understand
f_pos management :
        Having in mind things work that way :
        user : ls
        glibc : 
                open (->sys_open)
                getdentries64 (->sys_getdentries64)
        kernel:
                sys_getdentries64
                ->vfs_readdir
                        ->ext2_readdir
At that point, I don't understand why ext2_readdir is playing with
filp->f_pos .... It should be 0 ...Why does it care about offset ?
Thanks in advance for your precious help,
FabF
