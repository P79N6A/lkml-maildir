reiserfs 3.6.x under 2.4.x should go much higher unless i am reading

yup, it does.
as for NFS, I'm not sure how to pass O_LARGEFILE via the protocol and
since NFS isn't really POSIX like anyhow decided we might as well
just ingore it and have all sys_open calls for NFS look like
O_LARGEFILE was specified
move this check and also write/seek check into the VFS would make
sense; right now you can 
  f = open("blah",O_RDWR & ~O_LARGEFILE);
  lseek(f,1024*1024*1024,SEEK_CUR);
  lseek(f,1024*1024*1024,SEEK_CUR);
  lseek(f,1024*1024*1024,SEEK_CUR);
  write(f,"alan's beard",12);
  close(f);
and create a file you cannot open again with the same application
