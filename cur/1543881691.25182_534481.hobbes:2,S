Modified the tool to distinguish between
1. cross references between directories and files
2. cross references between directories and sub directories
3. cross references within a file (due to huge file size)
Below is the result from / partition of ext3 file system:
Number of files = 221794
Number of directories = 24457
Total size = 8193116 KB
Total data stored = 7187392 KB
Size of block groups = 131072 KB
Number of inodes per block group = 16288
No. of cross references between directories and sub-directories = 7791
No. of cross references between directories and file = 657
Total no. of cross references = 62018 (dir ref = 8448, file ref = 53570)
Thanks for the suggestions.
