Before my question, i'd like to ask all replies be CC'd directly to me
please =]...
Ok, i'm running a setup where i have the linux box doing the routing for 2
client win98 computers.  The linux computer is not fast enough nor has it
the HD space to run an ftp site.....i want to run one on the faster
clients....
I've read about port forwarding, ipmasqadm, etc, so i gave it a try...I'm
running Redhat 6 kernel 2.2.5 btw....
my ipchains syntax stayed the same, i use the same i did for my ip
masquerading setup:
ipchains -A forward -s 192.168.0.0/24 -j MASQ
now, i had the ipmasqadm line as follows, my intentions was to forward all
incoming traffic on port 5150 on the linux machine to port 21 on the
internal client....
ipmasqadm portfw  -a -P tcp -L <my_inet_ip> 5150 -R 192.168.0.2 21
I also had my ftp server running on the internal comp, i had someone
external to my network test it, and it did not connect/go through....
Tips/suggestions/what am i doing wrongs' PLEASE =]
Thanks....
