That's right, although it's worse than that.  You need to have a process 
with CAP_SYS_ADMIN.  If root processes normally have that capability 
then the reserved slots may well disappear before you notice a problem.  
If root processes normally don't have it, then you need to guarantee 
that one is already running.
