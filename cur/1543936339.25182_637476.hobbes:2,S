The patch only changes the _p usage within the shared library. The hp.c
code is used solely by the ISA HP driver and needed.

They don't need to, any more than they need to know about 8390 right now.
It is added to the Makefile so will be sucked in and built by Make as an
extra module. The 8390p and 8390 use different wrapper symbols for
ei_open etc so depmod will load the right one.
