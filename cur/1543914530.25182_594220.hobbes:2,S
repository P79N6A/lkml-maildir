Yes I have a draft here now of a virtual compound page solution that I am 
testing with SLUB. Page allocator first tries to allocate a contiguous 
page. If that is not possible then we string together a contiguous page 
through order 0 allocs and vmalloc.

Yes I have not heard about those. Got some more ideas how to clean it up 
even more in the meantime. No feedback usually means no objections.....

Well we need the page pools anyways for large page sizes > MAX_ORDER. But

Ill try to do the virtual mapped compound pages. Hopefully that will 
allow fallback for compound pages in a generic way.
