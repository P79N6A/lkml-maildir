Yes you do.  Please, read _cpu_up(), _cpu_down() and the example in
workqueue_cpu_callback().  It's really very simple.

That'll matter if we do crappy code.  Let's not do that?

The code's already racy and I don't think anyone has reported a
cpufreq-vs-hotplug race.

No, that won't fix it.  For example, take a look at all the *callers* of
cpufreq_update_policy().  AFAICT they're all buggy.  Fiddling with the
existing lock_cpu_hotplug() sites won't fix that.  (Possibly this
particular problem can be fixed by checking that the relevant CPU is still
online after the appropriate locking has been taken - dunno).
It needs to be ripped out and some understanding, thought and design should
be applied to the problem.

That's because lock_cpu_hotplug() purports to be some magical thing which
makes all your troubles go away.
