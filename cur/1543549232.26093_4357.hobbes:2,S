Has anyone had any problems with software RAID causing high loadaverage
peaks?  I've got a number of i586 boxes here, dual IDE controllers, one
drive on each controller.  They're using RAID 1 across the two
drives.  Every few hours, the load average peaks very high, and it appears
to be the RAID (identacal boxes, running identical software but without
the RAID don't seem to have the problem).
Is this normal, or is something broken on these boxes?
