Subject: UDMA causing kernel to crash?

Here is a wierd one for you; 
I have a DFI P5BV3+ motherboard with a Apollo Via chipset and a K6/2-350
CPU. The machine currently has 256Meg memory.
I have a WD Caviar UDMA 4.3gb and a Fujitsu 4.3gb UDMA drive and both show
up as UDMA drives as the system boots up, but the moment the system tries
to mount the file systems, I get a real fatal error and have to cold
reboot the system.  The error is: 
Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 00000018
current:>tss.cr3
There is quite a lot more info on the screen but mostly register dumps and
stack info.
The version of kernel is 2.1.1 and there is an adaptec FDomain SCSI in addition
to the IDE's which is connected to s DAT tape drive - no disks on scsi.
When I switch the UDMA to disabled on the bios for the IDE controller, Every-
thing seems to work fine.
Am I missing something?
thanks...
