Let me resist the temptation and not go into the definition of horsepower
here. You can refer any dictionary.

This variable represents how many tasks(multiplied by scaling factor
SCHED_LOAD_SCALE)the group can handle before it starts distributing the load
to other idle or less lightly loaded groups. For example, group with
two HT threads will have it as < 2 * SCHED_LOAD_SCALE. group with
N physical cpus in a NUMA node will have it as N * SCHED_LOAD_SCALE.
When power savings policy is enabled, some of the domains group values will
increase making each group pickup more load and save some watt power.
"group_capacity" or "load_capacity" might be good term considering all this..
