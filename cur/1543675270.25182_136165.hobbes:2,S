Hi Richard,
The kernel has the "ro" commandline-parameter.
There is no remount after the system boots.
"touch /bla" gives a read-only fs error.

Just did the same here (on my workstation).  And the times *did* change ..
More precisely: the "modification" & "change" were updated, the "access"
time remained unchanged.
RH9, kernel-2.4.20-13.9
