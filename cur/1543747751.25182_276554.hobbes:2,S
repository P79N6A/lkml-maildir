Subject: [PATCH 0/3] A few misc patches for 2.6.10-rc2

Here are 3 patches against the latest -bk tree (or 2.6.10-rc2).  I'm
putting them in email, as they are relativly tiny.  They do the
following:
	- fix a comment in the driver core
	- fix a memory leak in sysfs
	- add some documentation about the kernel interfaces (also
	  availble on the web at
	  
http://www.kroah.com/log/linux/stable_api_nonsense.html
 if
	  people want to read it there.)
Please apply.
thanks,
greg k-h
