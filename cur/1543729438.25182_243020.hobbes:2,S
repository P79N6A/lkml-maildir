Actually this is is a classic example of over-engineering (not on your side
but the original drm side). IF a normal driver supports pci and isa devices
it depends on PCI || ISA and has ifdefs or stubs for both.
Similarly drm should depend on AGP for those cards where there are only
AGP versions (most of them) and the driver where pci is also posisble (some
ati driver only IIRC) could compile with or withut but I'd be a compile-time
thing.
