Sorry, I wasn't very clear.  I'd like to find a way to just do the memset in the one case it is needed (a real writepage), and not do it when we are using writepage just to flush dirty buffers.  I don't see how to do it though, without making a new flush operation.  That would also solve my concerns about the change in writepage semantics (even though every FS I could find in the kernel tree was using block_write_full_page). 
thanks,
Chris
