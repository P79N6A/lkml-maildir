Hello,
i hope that's the right address for this little problem, which arises 
with linux kernel 2.4.34.
If i compile the Advanced Power Management as module it do not work. If 
i try a depmod i get an unresolved symbols message and so it cannot be 
loaded of course.
But if the APM part is compiled into the kernel directly it works.
Simply disable the compile as module option?
Thanks
   Ingo
