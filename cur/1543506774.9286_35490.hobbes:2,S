If you take a look at the changes, it's not too difficult to see why
the "stable" kernels are not as stable as one might like. Lots of changes
get in that are not strictly bug fixes. The most direct problem is the
one you point out: that the "stable" kernels are unstable. However, there
are other problems with a policy of back-porting new features to "stable"
kernels. It reduces the incentive to get the current development kernel
closed, thereby slowing the development cycle. I think this is a big part
of the reason why 2.2 arrived more than two years later than 2.0. In other
words, if new features were not added to "stable" kernels, then Linus
would not be under so much pressure to continue accepting patches to the
developmental kernels.
Enforcing a policy of accepting only bug fixes into the "stable" kernels
would have three effects: 1) the "stable" kernels would become more
stable, probably much more stable, 2) the pressure on Linus (and others)
would shift from keeping the development kernel going longer to getting it
closed sooner, which would shorten the development cycle (I think this
faster development cycle would result in many features getting into the
stable kernels sooner rather than later), and 3) would make Linux much
more palatable to enterprise IT departments.
People needing new features right away could either patch the stable
kernel themselves or, in the case of popular features, use Alan's ac
patches.
