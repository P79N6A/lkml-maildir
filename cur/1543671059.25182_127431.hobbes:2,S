You would have already OOM-killed them if you pre-reserved space, since
instead of using that space for swap like you should have, you reserved
it for swsusp.  This means that if swsusp had to OOM-kill in the swap
scenario, the system would already have run out of memory and had to
oom-kill in the reserved partition scenario.
It's just a matter of whether the system lets you start some tasks it 
can't suspend, in which case it has to shut them down during the suspend
stage, or it doesn't let you run those tasks, in which case you've
already run out of memory and had to terminate them.
It seems to me the real thing you want here is growable swap files in
the kernel.  This would let both cases succeed, provided there's enough
disk space sitting around in some filesystem which is marked for swap.
Of course, if you run out of disk, you'd still hit OOM in either case,
and disk full too.  And of course, if swap is allowed to grow without
bound, the system will thrash itself to death instead of OOM-ing
whenever a process goes wild.
