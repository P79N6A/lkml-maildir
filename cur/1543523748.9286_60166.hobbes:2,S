I'm still getting many of these messages in my /var/log/messages.
I've mailed the list several times about this, but have gotten
no response to date.

I'm not sure if this really indicates a problem, but there are
several thousand of these messages in my logs. They seem to
be triggered by actions that walk the directory hierarchy (i.e.
backups, find, etc.). If they're just harmless warnings (which I haven't
been able to ascertain perusing the kernel source), I can understand
the ones that correspond to the md devices (09:<nn>/<inum>), but
the ones for 00:00 and 00:01 don't make much sense to me. These are
not devices I would normally connect with having i-nodes.
System is a dual PPro 200MHz (SuperMicro P6DNE) with 512MB, all
file systems are on md (RAID 1) devices, kernel is 2.2.13ac3 +
ide-tape patch for Onstream DI-30 drive. Otherwise, the system
is a RedHat 6.0 + most of the updates RedHat and KRUD updates.
Thanks in advance for any insight/help/advice you can give...
