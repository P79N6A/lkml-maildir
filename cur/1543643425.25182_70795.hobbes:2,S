Maxtor's tech support says this is NOT true.

Problem is we're currently flushing the cache AFTER we do
standby...

That code is only executed if the '-h' option is passed to halt:
Some distros (namely Slackware 7.x) pass the '-p' option instead
(look in /etc/rc.d/rc.0).
Ok how about this: I'm current testing some patches against
ide.c and friends. Why don't I just add ( and document ) a
define called NO_STANDBY_ON_SHUTDOWN which would live in 
ide.c. By default it would not be defined. Then I just wrap
the standby code in an '#ifndef NO_STANDBY_ON_SHUTDOWN..#endif'
block.
