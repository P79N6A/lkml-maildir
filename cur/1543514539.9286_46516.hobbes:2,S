Yes.  I've set it up so that I get an interrupt when a temp threshold is
exceeded, which I use to turn on throttling.  We're using it for temperature
management in a server rather than for power control, but I assume laptops can
do the same thing.  For the PPC the correct solution is to poll one of the
timebase registers rather than pure busy waiting.
