i don't think anyone really knows "all" kernel code.  have you looked at
just how much code there is?  certainly you should try to understand as
much of the "core" code as possible, as that part is reasonably small
and important.  the rest is either architecture-specific stuff (i386,
sparc), major subsystems (networking, vfs), or drivers (eepro100,
serial).
whats important is gaining a general understanding of how things are
done/what to watch out for in linux kernelville.  for example if you
want to write a network card driver you'd look at how an existing
driver[1] interacts with the rest of the kernel and use that as an
example.  same can be said everywhere else.
hope that helps,
j.
[1] picking the right example is an exercise in itself, maybe look at
    
http://kerneljanitor.org/
 for some idea of what could be a bad
    example
