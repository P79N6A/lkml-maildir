you are right - let me rephrase it as: "this issue was mainly hidden due 
to the unhealthy ping-pong between lkml (which you said you didnt read), 
linux-scsi and bugzilla".

all the "action" already happened on the first day of reporting the bug. 
(the wrong commit was identified, but that's besides the point - it all 
sat inactive after that point. I pinged the bugzilla to get the lkml 
discussion active again, not to debug it there.)
what got movement into it all again was the revert.

what "blame shifting" ???
all i'm worried about here is the long latency for a bugfix which very 
apparently (to me) happened due to the isolation of linux-scsi and the 
resulting bug processing inefficiencies. Bugs happen and nobody is to be 
"blamed" for the bug itself - but the bug processing flow was broken and 
i've pointed that out. (If you see similar cases for code i maintain, 
and if you can pinpoint the reason why you think it happened and how to 
improve that, then please point it out to me as well.)
