MESI is a bit more complicated than clean/dirty status.
This is a very good state machine graph for MESI :
http://odin.ee.uwa.edu.au/~morris/CA406/cache_coh.html
Besides this, i don't get how a LIFO could help you.
From a cache point of view if the slab-free code run on processor A and
the slab-alloc code will run on a processor B, if these two ops are
executed very close in time ( due LIFO ) there's a good probability of
modified->shared migration that will result in pushback ops.
A FIFO will result in more time between free and alloc with a good probability
that the interlock will be relaxed.
