this has been taken from first from edge module, just to put it into example ;)

I didn't knew that. I have at least as i said 300 of those, if user
space software is doing something else. In practice i have around 30.
even if 1000 it gives 1000*8kb=8MB so it is not that bad. This mashine
has 128MB atleast.
Whatver, should i consider timer as interrupt too ?
