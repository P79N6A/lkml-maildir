That's possible but it's not necessarily the case.  There is one real
bug in the hid-input.c which would cause a hang on single-CPU machines
when connecting the BTC keyboard.  See this mail (patch included):
  http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-usb-devel&m=107889747301413
There also seems to be a bug in the BTC keyboard which causes the
hid-core to time out when initializing the keyboard.  That problem
isn't fatal, but it's annoying to have to wait for 10+ seconds to wait
for the keyboard to become online.  A workaround for this bug can be
found in this mail:
  http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-usb-devel&m=107889855108618
I'd be interested in hearing if that fixes the problems for your machine.
