great spotting, I'm grateful you found such a race. It could never be
noticed with testing. it definitely needs the page_table_lock to
serialize (I was biased by the vma merging that happens with the
down_write I guess ;).  Note that in the common case anon_vma_prepare
will do nothing, so I believe this fix should be already close optimal
(I know we could save a few cycles in the unlikely case by doing
something more than just anon_vma_prepare but that would render memory.c
more complicated, so it's doable but it's a lowpriority matter and I'd
be interested in having a smallest possible fix at the moment for
pratical reasons). later on we can optimize it further.
comments?
