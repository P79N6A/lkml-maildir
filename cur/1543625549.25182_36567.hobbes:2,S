Is it possible that they've changed this in newer revisions of their
chips?  Why is it junk?  What could've been done better?  What effects has
does the "junky" DMA engine have on the NIC (can there be packet losses when
there's packet bursts, for instance)?
(I'm asking this because we're considering servers which as broadcom NICs
as the only NICs on-board, on the servers).
