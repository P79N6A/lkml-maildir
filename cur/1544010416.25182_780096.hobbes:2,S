It was in -mm for half a year before it went to mainline in 2.6.23, the
documentation being present all the time. It was discussed intensively
on lkml, and several core kernel developers reviewed it. The special use
of the mmap() offset parameter was never even mentioned by anybody. I
remember that so well because I actually expected critizism, but everybody
was fine with it. And to be honest, even though it's unusual, I still find
it a good solution.
Thanks,
