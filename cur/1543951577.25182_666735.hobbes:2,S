No, they do not; that was simply the most convenient / obvious
example I could think of for someone reading changelogs a few
years later and wondering why we created this sysfs attribute.
A real world example would be HP managability software keeping
track of CMC/CPE data for CPUs over a long period of time for the
purpose of doing long-term failure analysis.
This software can already grab a bunch of info from IPMI, such as
CPU serial number, date code, physical location, but cannot
correlate it to the kernel's idea of logical CPU number and
physloc.
Having the kernel expose the physical slot ties it all together.
This example is something any vendor selling higher level
managability software might want to do, and specifically HP wants
to do it to take care of our customers who have large deployments
of these legacy systems.
Hopefully that is enough justification to warrant at least
looking at the patch and telling me why it sucks. ;)

Well, at least for HP ia64 machines, we have lots of
silk-screening on the backplane, as well as pretty diagrams on
chassis covers, and we took care in making sure our what our
firmware matches up with those pictures.
But in general, I like the idea of das blinkenlights too. :)

Heh, then just make the failure light either blink (for failure)
or not blink (default). Then as long as the operator can detect
lumens, he/she would just be able to pull the blinky board. :)
Thanks.
