Hi Mr. Halasa.
I sent you a message some days ago asking for the inverse ARP
implementation status in the hdlc driver.
Once I haven't received any answer, I started implementing it by myself,
based on linux kernel version 2.4.17. The protocol message exchange,
ARPOP_InREQUEST and ARPOP_InREPLY, is done and working fine, both being
treated by arp_rcv function in arp.c file.
Now, I would like to know which action should be taken when arp_rcv
(arp.c) receives an inverse ARP reply message. I thought just to add a
new route to the host that sent the message, but I would prefer having
your opinion about that.
I added a new paramenter in sethdlc to enable inverse arp, and just by
now the pointopoint parameter in ifconfig should be set to 0.0.0.0.
Thus, to setup a pvc :
sethdlc hdlc0 v35 clock ext
sethdlc hdlc0 fr lmi ansi dce t391 10 t392 15 n391 10 n392 10 n393 10
ifconfig hdlc0 0 0.0.0.0 up
sethdlc hdlc0 create 16 inverse_arp
ifconfig pvc0 10.0.0.2 pointopoint 0.0.0.0 mtu 1500 up
I attached a diff file with the changes I did, and also the sethdlc.
Please analyse them and send me back your comments, and if possible,
something that help me to "fill the blanks" I left as ??? in the code.
Thanks in advance.
