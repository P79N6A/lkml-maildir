More ugly issues abound, see below :)

Haven't run into anything yet that trips up the legacy/native detection 
in libata except for mixed mode (1 port legacy, 1 port native).  But 
those bugs aren't in the area of code we're discussing.

Its not that simple.  grep for ____request_region in both libata and the 
PCI quirks code.  libata grabs the SATA port on ICH boxes in combined 
mode... but has to do so before built-in IDE driver grabs them.
