You won't be spending anywhere near as much time typing the
code as you (and everybody else) will be spending _reading_
the code.

Presuming you'll never debug your code ;)

They're _LINUX_RMAP_H and not _LINUX_OBJRMAP_H.  If you want
to be consistent you may want to either rename the inclusion
guards, or the file ;)

Only if (1) you're using bitkeeper and (2) you used 'bk mv'
to move rmap.c to objrmap.c and (3) Linus pulls from your
bitkeeper tree.
Unless all 3 of these are true, you're giving bitkeeper more
credit than it deserves ;)

Funny, first thing I hear about that ;)
