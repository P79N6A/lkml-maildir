Doing so will create havoc on sequential devices, such as tape drives. If
your system simply suspends, then all is well. Any data that isn't flushed
yet is buffered inside the tapedrive. But when the system resumes and resets
the SCSI bus, it will cause all data in the tape drive to be lost, and for
most tape systems it will also re-position them at LBOT. Any running
tar/dump/whatever tape process would not survive such a suspend-resume
cycle.
Another more subtle issue is state information that exists between the SCSI
controller and the target devices. At some point they might have negotiated
synchronous and/or wide transfer parameters. This information must be
preserved, or you'll observe lockups, data corruption and the likes. Since
these parameters are maintained at the lowest driver level, they should know
about suspend. The low-level driver must know to re-negotiate these
parameters when it comes back to life.
