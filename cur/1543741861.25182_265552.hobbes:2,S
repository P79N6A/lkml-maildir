As it happens, I had a chat with a few people on IRC a few days ago who 
had very similar trouble and I had no such trouble. After talking about 
our kernel configs a bit we came to the conclusion that the main 
difference between our .config's (except for some hardware specific 
drivers and a few other bits that seemed unrelated) was that they had 
CONFIG_LEGACY_PTYS=y while I had it unset. One guy recompiled his kernel 
on the spot and disabled CONFIG_LEGACY_PTYS and then reported that his 
trouble went away. He may have made other changes as well, I don't know, 
and it may have been some of the seemingly unrelated bits that did the 
trick, again I don't know.
I have not attempted to verify this myself, but I'd say it's worth a try 
for you to disable CONFIG_LEGACY_PTYS (if you have it enabled) and then 
test that (and report your findings back).
