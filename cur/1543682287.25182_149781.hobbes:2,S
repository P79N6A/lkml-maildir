Hi all.
Some of you have apparently been including an X-Header-Flag: header
in your outgoing emails. A recent signature update means that any
emails containing that header now get labelled as viruses, so get
deleted unread by my anti-virus system. As a result, whilst those
might be fun for you to use, they will soon prevent your emails
from being read by many other people.
So far, ALL of the affected emails that have been received here
have been on the Linux-Kernel mailing list, hence my posting this
email to this list, and also to the server's postmaster for their
reference. I feel that a warning is only fair now I realise why it
is happening.
Best wishes from Riley.
