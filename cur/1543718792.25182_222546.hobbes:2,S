It seems eccentric to implement MAP_POPULATE only on PROT_NONE mappings:
do_mmap_pgoff is passing down prot, then sys_remap_file_pages verifies
it's not set.  I guess that's an oversight from when we realized that
the prot arg to sys_remap_file_pages was misdesigned.
There's another oddity whose heritage is harder for me to understand,
so please let me leave it to you: sys_remap_file_pages is declared as
asmlinkage in mm/fremap.c, but is the one syscall declared without
asmlinkage in include/linux/syscalls.h.
