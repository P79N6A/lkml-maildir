You can have security holes now just by tricking an app into reading
files written by another app which disagreed on the locale.
And as for the filename problems :
- just mangle existing invalid filenames when a default encoding is
agreed upon
- refuse to write new files with invalid filenames just like you would
with the few names forbidden in ascii - apps will learn to cope.
Some convention is needed, expecting it to materialise without os
enforcement is deluding oneself, getting a change like this in place
will definitely be painful but the current situation is far from
painless for a lot of people.
