I've got this fish caught in the my serial driver rewrite - the driver
always handles the requesting and freeing of the resources.  If it is
unable to request the resources, then you will receive a suitable error
when trying to configure two ports.
Please note that I'm not about to take on maintainence of the current
serial.c driver, except where I spot obvious bugs.
I'd recommend that you pass this one to Marcelo to incorporate (only
after he's got his feet on the ground again. 8))  It looks sensible.

Hi,
  I have found a bug. It is in support of serial cards which uses memory 
for I/O
insted of ports. I made a patch for serial.c and fix one place, but 
probably the
problem like this one could be somewhere else.
Description:
  If you try to use setserial with such cards you will get "Address in 
use" (-EADDRINUSE)
Best regards,
                      Kurakin Roman
