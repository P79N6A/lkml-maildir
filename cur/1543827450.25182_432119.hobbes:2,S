actually, the scsi-level reported by the device is *not* 2.
it is set to 2 by "slave_configure" from drivers/usb/storage/scsiglue.c:
static int slave_configure(struct scsi_device *sdev)
{
...
        /* Set the SCSI level to at least 2.  We'll leave it at 3 if that's
         * what is originally reported.  We need this to avoid confusing
         * the SCSI layer with devices that report 0 or 1, but need 10-byte
         * commands (ala ATAPI devices behind certain bridges, or devices
                                              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
the CY7C68310 is exactly that.
         * which simply have broken INQUIRY data).
...
        if (sdev->scsi_level < SCSI_2)
                sdev->scsi_level = sdev->sdev_target->scsi_level = SCSI_2;
