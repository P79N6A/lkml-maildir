Ingo,
I haven't used any of the RT patches since V0.7.51-xx, but I upgraded to -rt8 
yesterday and had a couple of problems. I've just noticed you released -rt9, 
but I don't think my problem is listed as fixed.. I'll upgrade anyway, in a 
minute.
The problem I'm having is that when the kernel probes my IDE devices it slows 
down, taking ages to complete the probe. Henceforth the kernel seems to work 
at a slower speed doing just about anything (compiling, etc.), but 
interactive performance is okay. It's a bizarre problem.
Of course, I assumed this was due to the latest timer changes, and so I 
disabled CONFIG_HIGH_RES_TIMERS and went back to CONFIG_HPET_TIMER.
This works perfectly.
For the moment, is it worth debugging problems in the high res timers set or 
are there known (fixable) issues?
