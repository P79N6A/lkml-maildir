I believe I've narrowed down the cause of my oopses/panics:
If I build with CONFIG_MK7 but comment out
	   define_bool CONFIG_X86_USE_3DNOW y
in the MK7 part of arch/i386/config.in, the 2.4.4 kernel appears to run
perfectly.
On a side note, if I leave arch/i386/config.h untouched but force the use
of the generic MMX implementations of fast_clear_page() and
fast_copy_page() in arch/i386/lib/mmx.c, then I get some odd behavior but
nothing as bad as I had been getting before.  (For example, running awk
always produces the message "awk: cmd. line: 1: (FILENAME- FNR=1) fatal:
attempt to access field -2147483648".)
Could this be a sign of a faulty 3DNOW! core in my CPU?  If so, do you
know of any utilities I could run that test these instructions?  (For
Linux or Windows.)
The CPU is a 1.2GHz Athlon Thunderbird with a 266MHz frontside bus.  In
case it's helpful, I've attached the contents of /proc/cpuinfo.
Thanks in advance to anyone who can help!
