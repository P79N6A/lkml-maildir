these look like genuine fixes, but i dont think they can explain the hangs
i had yesterday - those were simple VM deadlocks. I dont see any deadlocks
today - but i'm running the unsafe B2 variant of the vmfixes patch. (and i
have no swapping enabled which simplifies my VM setup.)
but one of these two fixes could explain the slowdown i saw on and off for
quite some time, seeing very bad read performance occasionally. (do you
remember my sched.c tq_disc hack?)
