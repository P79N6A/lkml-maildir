& this has a seemingly obvious solution, which is, if the autoprobe
stuff is selected, and, after presentation of the initial list
of drivers, plus comments like 'Network card: none', 'Sound card: none',
say 'We may have missed some stuff if you have an old computer, press
Y if what we've detected doesn't find all your hardware', and if
they press Y (only), select as modules every ISA driver except
those, which when loaded on a system not containing the relevant
card, can cause a hangup; thus deferring the autoprobing until
boot time.
