The latest version of the staircase cpu scheduler policy rewrite is now 
available for 2.6.9 and 2.6.9-mm1. v9.0 is v8.K renamed to keep in sync 
with the mainline version numbering.

For those who are unaware, all the bugs that were brought to light in 
testing from the version in 2.6.8-rc2-mm2 till now have been addressed. 
Please retest if you have been waiting for a stable version. This is the 
same version that is in 2.6.9-ck1.
Cheers,
Con
