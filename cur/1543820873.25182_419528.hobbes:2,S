Subject: [PATCH 2/2 (repost)] mm: avoid unnecessary looping in out_of_memory()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/4/27/265

I see no reason to loop in out_of_memory().  If oom_kill_process()
returns 1, this may be because the task that select_bad_process()
chose is now exiting (and therefore oom_kill_task() found the ->mm
pointer of the chosen task to be NULL).  out_of_memory() may as well
return to its caller, perhaps avoiding the need to shoot a process.
If the memory issues are still not resolved, out_of_memory() will be
called again so there's no reason to loop.
