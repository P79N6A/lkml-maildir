The watchdogN devices show up under the "legacy" directory because
they are platform devices.  From reading the driver-model documentation,
I believe that platform devices are the correct way of categorizing
watchdog devices.
<pasting from Documentation/driver-model/platform.txt>
Platform devices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Platform devices are devices that typically appear as autonomous
entities in the system. This includes legacy port-based devices and
host bridges to peripheral buses. 
Platform drivers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Drivers for platform devices have typically very simple and
unstructured. Either the device was present at a particular I/O port
and the driver was loaded, or there was not. There was no possibility
of hotplugging or alternative discovery besides probing at a specific
I/O address and expecting a specific response.
