I'm not seeing anything jump out at me about what this bug might be.
Could you give me a little bit more information on your setup?
I see you're running with an inird.  Are you doing anything funky like
pivoting over to a nfs root?  Could you send me the initrd you are
using?  I might as well just try and boot with it.
