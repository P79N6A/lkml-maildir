Subject: [PATCH] fbcon: ReRe-fix little-endian bogosity in slow_imageblit()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

From: Franck Bui-Huu <fbuihuu@gmail.com>
It seems that this piece of code has already been fixed twice...
The first fix has been made by the following commit:
	81d3e147ec9ffc6ef04b5f05afa4bef22487b32b
by introducing FB_BIT_NR() macro to fix a 'potential' endianess
bug. It appears that change was broken for big endian platforms,
but I suspect it was for little-endian ones too.
Then a second fix has been made to fix the previous change for
big-endian platform, see commit:
	a536093a2f07007aa572e922752b7491b9ea8ff2
This commit actually reverted the first fix and thus makes the
big-endian case works but leaves the little-endian case broken.
Therefore it seems that the very first state was broken only
on little-endian platform...
This patch is the third and hopefully the last attempt to fix
this bug correctly. It restores the first fix _and_ swaps the
little-endian and bit-endian implementations of FB_BIT_NR().
Now, it should work for both endianness but has been tested on
little-endian machine only.
