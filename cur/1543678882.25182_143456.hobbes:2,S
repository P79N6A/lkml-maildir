Amen. That's exactly the point -- the v3 dvb api is stable and hasn't
changed for a long time.
So, to make a long story short:
In include/linux/dvb we have the headers that are shared between user
applications and the kernel driver. As I said above, these are stable and
never change for the v3 api. In an ideal world, these header files would
be included in your glibc distribution at /usr/include/linux/dvb
Currently, you must copy them by hand or create a symlink, because there
hasn't been an official kernel with the dvb driver subsystem yet.
The whole discussion was about the *in-kernel* header files in
drivers/media/dvb/dvb-core. These are used in drivers/media/dvb/frontends
for example, so we currently have one line in the Makefile that says to
have drivers/media/dvb/dvb-core in the include path.
This was the original point Sam Ravnborg was wondering about. It's safe to
move these files to inlude/dvb and get rid of the magic line in the
Makefile.
CU
Michael.
