Maybe a crazy idea, but if some OOPS is reproduceable, it might work to dump 
some subset of the calltrace - every time some other part (randomly).
Eg. If you need to show the last 64 stack words (of 8 characters each), but 
have only space for 80 characters (ie. 8 words in hexadecimal, plus 8 
spaces), you could print some index, and every 8th word from there on ...
Or, to increase the probability of getting information for each try, probably 
use some random steps, too.
Of course, all of this is moot if you've got a serial console ...

Phil
