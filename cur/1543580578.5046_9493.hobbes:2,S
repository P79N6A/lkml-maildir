Greetings,
I boot the Linux/MIPS kernel in the emulator board.
But the kernel will halt in gunzip the ramdisk.
And the LCD on the emulator board will show the memory dump.
Is there any possibility to make this kind of problem?
I guess the reason is running out of memory.
Any possibility is welcome!! Thanks!!
