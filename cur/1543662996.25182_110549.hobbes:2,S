Sure... I'll test them later on.

I'll try to narrow this down.

I don't think it's anything really obvious.  If the problem I'm seeing
is the same as the one showing up on *some* IBM NUMA-Q (or whatever
they are) boxen then it's probably not a driver or fs thing --- as we
have nothing in common.
Now... it could be two different problems, except the same kernel
which the IBM people found works for them also works for me.
Oddly, wli has not seen this problem and he's using similar hardware
(I think) to the other IBM people and the same compiler as me.

Nope.
A stripped down kernel, compile for a 486 with no IO-APIC support (in
an attempt to slow things down and hopefully avoid possible hardware
problems such as overheating) still reboots on me.
The only thing I can think of is a triple-fault...  I'm wondering
about using gcc-3.2 instead of 2.95.4 (Debian blah blort blem) on the
off chance it's a weird compiler problem.
