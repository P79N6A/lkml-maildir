Linux needs to zero files it truncate-extends because of security guarantees.
You could temporarily ignore the truncate after create if it's followed by
writing the file (defer untill first non-write), but it will be a BAD hack.
It might work.
Default: open(O_WRITE|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC) -> do it, goto State 1
         otherwise -> just do it
State 1: ftruncate -> remember offset instead of executing ftruncate,
                      goto State 2
         otherwise -> goto Default
State 2: write     -> do it, stay in State 2 unless file size increases
                      beyond fake size, then goto Default
         stat      -> return fake size
         otherwise -> really do ftruncate, goto Default
It might cause some operations to be slow you'd expect to be fast, and
I'm not sure how it has to deal with concurrent access.
