Nobody disagrees there (I think), the disagreement is on whether the
usefullness is worth the hassle.

"Coherency" and "different views" implies atomic transactions, and being
able to tell that an access to the file requieres updating random junk
about it. It requires being able to guess if it is worth updating now
(given that the file might be modified a dozen times more before the junk
being checked).

And they are doing fine AFAICS. Besides, they won't exactly jump on the
possibility of leaving behind all other OSes on which they run to become a
Linux-only format.

I don't buy this one. A tar.gz must be uncompressed and unpacked, and
whatever you could save is surely dwarfed by those costs.

Userspace support isn't there on any of the platforms right now, if ever it
will be a strange-Linux-installation thing for quite some time to come. Not
exactly attractive for application writers.

Sure! Gimme the CPU power and disk throughput for that, pretty please. [No,
I won't tell I have better use for those right now...]

With no description on how this is supposed to work, this is pure science
fiction/wet dreams.

Coherency is essential, but it isn't free. Far from it. The easiest way of
getting coherency is having _one_ authoritative source. That way you don't
need coherency, and don't pay for it. Anything in this class must by force
be just hints, to be recomputed at a moment's notice. I.e., let the
application who might use it check and recompute as needed.
