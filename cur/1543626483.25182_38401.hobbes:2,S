	On the contrary, the GPL specifically gives me the right to modify the code 
to make it more useful to me and distribute those modifications.

	They didn't have to put their code under the GPL if they didn't want to 
allow other people to use and modify it. You can't have it both ways -- 
there's no such thing as 'GPL but with a few extra restrictions I've added to 
the code that everyone's contributed to'.
