Where is
	* version for 2.5.<current>
	* analysis of benefits in real-world situations for 2.5 version?
Patch adds complexity and unless you can show that it gives significant
benefits outside of pathological situations, it's not going in.
Note: measurements on 2.4 do not make sense; reduction of cacheline
bouncing between 2.4 and 2.5 will change the results anyway and
if any of these patches are going to be applied to 2.4, reduction of
cacheline bouncing on ->d_count is going to go in before that one.
