With the default limit of 128 (max_user_instances) and 274274
(max_user_watches) on my machine, the maximum amount of memory
consumed by one user's epoll instances is barely noticable (around
1.5M).
Raising the max_user_instances to 512 brings us up to a maximum memory
usage of 43M already. However, from here on, we are already getting
limited by the number of user watches.
