Well!  That's interesting.  Reading from those files
induces the same calls to the PnP BIOS that crashed
your system before.  A mystery.  Perhaps there's a way
to use the "current" config of your PnP BIOS after all---
so long as you avoid the particular [sequences of] calls that
cause crashes.  You'll have to experiment with this yourself.
In the meantime, though, it's safest to disable use of
the "current" config entirely on Sony Vaio Laptops.  I'll
test your patch now.
