Note the tremendous slowdown which the P4 suffers when you're not
cacheline aligned.  Even 32-byte-aligned is down a lot.

This differs a little from my P4 testing - the rep;movsl approach
seemed OK for 8,16,32 alignment.
But still, that's something we can tune later.

I believe there are "issues" using those registers in-kernel. Related
to the need to save/restore them, or errata; not too sure about that.
