That is what I was trying to say. Well, not exactly... What I was
really trying to say is AFAIKS I2O system registers only one sysfs bus
object and all I2O devices reside on it. Unlike, for exaple input
objects, that can appear on serio, gameport, usb buses and so on. So
if one wants to see all I2O devices in sysfs he could just check
/sys/bus/i2o/devices/ and see them all there.
