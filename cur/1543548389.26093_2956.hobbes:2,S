This is what I'd like to be able to do... that way the checks that ioctl()
performs can be avoided.
However, there are problems with doing this:
(1) There's currently no definitive way to grab an unused syscall, whether a
    random one or a pre-determined one.
(2) The syscall table is not exported...
(3) Even if it was... just filling in the syscall slot from a module means
    that it is possible for the module to be unloaded whilst the syscall is in
    use.
