Kernel doesn't have to access it all at once. Most of the time it doesn't
care about the contents of most pages. It certainly needs some permanently
mapped stuff, but it's _way_ less than the full memory. The rest is mapped
and unmapped on demand. That's what kmap() and kunmap() do.
Moreover, 4.4BSD derivatives never bothered mapping the whole physical
memory in kernel space, even on 386. It's more complex than what we used
to do, but it's doable quite fine. There is no need to keep the whole
memory mapped by the kernel.

Nope. 16:32->32->36. Paging is _after_ the 32-bit bottleneck. You'ld have
to change segment descriptors format to expand it.
