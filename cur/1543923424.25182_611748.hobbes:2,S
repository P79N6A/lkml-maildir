If the child does not have the TIF_SYSCALL_AUDIT flag, it never goes into 
audit_syscall_entry. It becomes unauditable.

That would just be a small allocation of memory that will be returned when the 
process exits. From an auditing PoV, something that is undesirable is the 
inability to audit a process that you want to audit.

So when audit is re-enabled, how do you make that task auditable?

In the new child, but not the parent.

That is so you can walk the process table and "or" the bit in unconditionally. 
All processes need to be auditable or you've got a security hole.
