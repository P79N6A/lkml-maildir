Likewise, on IA-64, /proc/efi/ has EFI stuff (really only vars/ right now,
direct access to NVRAM variables), which coincidentally, I wrote, which
would benefit from a top-level 'platform' or 'firmware' directory and
migration to driverfs.  Code is in arch/ia64/kernel/efivars.c.  Once I nail
down the EDD code, moving efivars.c to driverfs shouldn't be hard.

Thanks, that helps a lot.  I need to still find how to walk the list of
existing devices and gather info, for purposes of making symlinks, but I see
the existing devices that do that to use as examples.
Thanks,
Matt
