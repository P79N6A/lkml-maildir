To be safe, run it on an image of your filesystem first. You can use
the dd command to take the image, then run e2fsck on it. Afterwards
mount it and make sure everything looks kosher. That is assuming you
have enough spare space, of course. If not then you should at least
run e2fsck with -n first to find out what it wants to do. Personally,
my risk tolerance would be closely correlated with the quality of my
backups.
Cheers,
Duane.
