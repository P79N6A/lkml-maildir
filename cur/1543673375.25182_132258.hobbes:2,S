Jos, if you switch to IOAPIC mode after failing you're going to have to 
reprogram the IOAPIC again as specified in the mptables, setup_IOAPIC_irqs 
does this. As well as do some other setup which ACPI let you get 
past in arch/i386/kernel/mpparse.c. In a nutshell it'll get very convoluted 
quickly.
