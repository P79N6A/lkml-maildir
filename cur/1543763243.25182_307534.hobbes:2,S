This sounds similar to the swsusp hang I started seeing when I upgraded
from 2.6.11 to 2.6.12-rc1; my touchpad was failing to reinitialize, so
input was calling hotplug which tried to exec /sbin/hotplug, and the
exec() blocked because userland was stopped.  If you do Sysrq-T and see
a process with a stack trace like
	wait_for_completion
	call_usermodehelper
	kobject_hotplug
	kobject_del
	class_device_del
	class_device_unregister
	mousedev_disconnect
	input_unregister_device
then you're seeing the same kind of bug.
Try the patch below from Dmitry.

===================================================================
Input: serio - do not attempt to immediately disconnect port if
       resume failed, let kseriod take care of it. Otherwise we
       may attempt to unregister associated input devices which
       will generate hotplug events which are not handled well
       during swsusp.
