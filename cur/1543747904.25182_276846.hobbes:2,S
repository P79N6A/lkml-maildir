It's more broken than that here. I get the following errors in 2.6.8
through 2.6.9-ac9 & 2.6.10-rc2 with the old (PDC202XX_OLD) promise
driver, when placing the disk/controller under any load (in fact just
doing hdparm -t -T /dev/hde).
I get..
hde: dma_intr: status=0xff { Busy }
ide: failed opcode was: unknown
hde: DMA disabled
PDC202XX: Primary channel reset.
PDC202XX: Secondary channel reset.
(a number of times)
ide2: reset timed-out, status=0xff
end_request: I/O error, dev hde, sector 11776
Buffer I/O error on device hde, logical block 1472
(many times)
Cheers,
Al.
