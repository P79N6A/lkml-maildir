All these data can be obtained from user-space,
no need for bloating sysfs.

works fine but probably needs some cut'n'paste updates
Most of these /proc files were buggy / inaccurate and keeping them

added gain in debugging problems (raw PCI config gives much more info).
and yes, this should've been done 2 years ago...
