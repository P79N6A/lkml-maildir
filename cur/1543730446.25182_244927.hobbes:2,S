Hi,
I got an assertion failure in  fs/jbd/transaction.c.
After a reboot, fsck found some errors on a ext3 fs (LVM2 over RAID1 if it
matters), a block was shared between multiple files.
I'm running a 2.6.8.1 kernel with supermount-ng patch.
My proc was a bit overclocked so it could be a hardware problem, but I
don't think so because I didn't notice other problems.
Can I do anything to help ?
