  I wonder if the KT133A (which is what the IWILL KK266 is based on)
differences
a could be a source of the problem.  My FSB is at plain old 100 MHz
since I
have regular PC100 SDRAM.  Overclocked, or not, I get the same results. 
I,
too, had an ABIT KA7[-RAID] and it was rock solid.  So much for "if it's
not broke, don't fix it" -- I should have listened to my gf, but that's
the life of an upgrader ;)...  In general the IWILL got great reviews at
a
number of reliable hardware review sites, and hey, it doesn't lock up in
windows ;) (ok don't flame me for that ;)).
