It might, in theory, add padding.  In practice a lot of code assumes that if
if you do all padding yourself so structure members are naturally aligned[*]
gcc will leave them in the order they are in and not add padding.
There is no reason to require readb() to compute offsets by hand while letting
TCP, DMA code aso use structs ( (u32 *)ip_header)[IP_SADDR] = source_address; -
yuck), and what I'm saying there is no reason to "fix" drivers that use structs
for readb() offsets.
