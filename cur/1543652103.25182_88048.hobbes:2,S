Actually implementing a fair spinlocks and fair rwlocks on the x86 arch are
very easy (at least, if you have XADD it is). Any arch which has CMPXCHG can
also do it, just not so easily.
I've attached an implementation of a fair spinlock and an implementation of a
fair rwlock (which can be compiled and played with in u-space).
