Umm. You didn't mention which kernel/patch? I seem to recall you were using 
Osomething but which?

If this is Osomething, can you tell me when it started doing this and what 
vanilla does.

A thought, but unfortunately some arbitrary limit would just be hit by 
everything randomly rather than with any meaningful frequency. The timeslice  
interactive things use up is extremely variable depending on circumstances.
