It's a bit cheesy to be printing the units like this.  It's better to just
print the raw number.
If you really want to remind the user what units that number is in (not a
bad idea) then it can be encoded in the filename, like
/proc/sys/vm/min_free_kbytes, /proc/sys/vm/dirty_expire_centisecs, etc.

don't think we want that.
