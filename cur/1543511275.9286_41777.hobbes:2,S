No. XFree86 supports fb as a target. Thats totally different.

Actually it reduces portability. The mmap/userspace setup it has no is
portably over a whole array of OS's . That is also why most video capture
in XFree 4.0 will not go via the kernel. since most of the video capture
is very closely tied to the video card it makes sense.
