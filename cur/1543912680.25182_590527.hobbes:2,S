I noticed the frequency gets turned down after check_nmi_watchdog() is
called.. I think it's suppose to trigger once per second, but it's more
like it updates randomly ..
In older kernels it's very slow, but it's more consistent ..
Here is some output ..

If you look at the LOC values you'll notice a lot of time has passed,
with only one NMI and on only one cpu ..
It's possible this is something else completely tho ..

Here's the only lines printed,
setting INTEL_ARCH_PERFCTR0 to -0x0131385e
setting INTEL_ARCH_PERFCTR0 to -0x0131385e
