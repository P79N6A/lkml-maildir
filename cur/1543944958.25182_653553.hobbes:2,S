I see. I didn't consider this aspect.

I would just do it permanently.

I attempted something like this with my advisory vs required static
protections last week, but it was rejected.
But yes having such a mode would make sense agreed. 
The easiest way (as in least amount of code) to implement it actually 
is to just bypass set_memory_*() and just do the lookup_address() yourself 
and clear NX and do a global TLB flush. For the special case of NX
that is fine because you don't need to worry about fixing up any aliases.
