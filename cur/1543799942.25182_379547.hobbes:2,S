hmm ... had to dig that out, as the #kernelnebies 
irc log search is 'not' broken either ...
-------------------
The latest prepatch for the stable Linux kernel tree is:  2.6.15-rc7     2005-12-25
The latest snapshot for the stable Linux kernel tree is:  2.6.14-git14   2005-11-11
that was on the 25th of December, around 19:30
note that at this time the latest snapshot actually
was patch-2.6.15-rc6-git4 and not 2.6.14-git14 as 
the script wanted to make us believe (which is the
last 2.6.14-git)
so, as we now 'know' that this is intentional, please
just explain (to me and other confused folks) what
the intentions behind that actually are.
TIA,
Herbert
