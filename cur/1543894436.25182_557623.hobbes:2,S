You mean if the original author gets hit by a bus and their estate gets sold 
to SCO they can't revoke our rights to the code?  How is this a down side?
And you do have more rights than anyone else: as the copyright holder you can 
issue other licenses, and you have standing to sue to enforce the code.  (If 
nobody else has a copyright on the code, they don't have standing to sue to 
enforce the license terms.)
(Right now, nobody EXCEPT the FSF has the right to sue somebody to enforce the 
license terms on something like gcc.  Do you find that a comforting thought?)
