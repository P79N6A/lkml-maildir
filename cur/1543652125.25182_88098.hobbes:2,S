I've seen all sorts of interesting drive failure modes, including losing 
communications with the drive for a short period and then having it come 
back almost as good as new.  We've had some data corruption on flaky 
drives and I'm guessing this has something to do with it.
I'm going to sit down with our application developers and see what they 
want to see from their end and see what I can do.
