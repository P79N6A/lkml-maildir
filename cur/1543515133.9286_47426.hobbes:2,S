Just do the ioremap() unconditionally.
Note that the isa_xxxx() functions are for old drivers that do NOT know
about ioremap(), and think that the ISA space is always mapped. Think of
it as a band-aid for stupid drivers, making it easier to bring them up to
working order. But the "ioremap()" approach is always the right one.
