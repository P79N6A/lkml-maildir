Taking a quick glance at v9fs and fuse I fail to see how either
plays nicely with the page cache.
v9fs according to my reading of the protocol specification does
not have any concept of a lease.  So you can't tell if you are
talking about a virtual filesystem where all calls should be passed
straight to the server or a real filesystem where you can perform
caching.  The implementation simply appears to bypass the pagecache
which seems sane.
Skimming through the FUSE code I see the same problem, in that you can't
autodetect the right thing.  This is currently hacked around with
"direct_io" mount option selecting between a cached and a non-cached
status on a filesystem basis at mount time.  But having
a per file flag would be nicer.  I also don't understand
why in fuse direct_io is an if statement in fuse_file_read/write
instead of simply being a different set of filesystem operations.
Neither implementation seems to forward user space locks to the
filesystem server.
