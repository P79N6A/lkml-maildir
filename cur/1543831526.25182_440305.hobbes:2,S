Well, I get this:
pcmcia: request for exclusive IRQ could not be fulfilled.
pcmcia: the driver needs updating to supported shared IRQ lines.
eth2: NE2000 (DL10022 rev 30): io 0x300, irq 11, hw_addr 00:50:BA:73:92:3D
Which seems to indicate I need to tweak the PCMCIA settings to get this card
working.  I wonder if anyone is going to follow up on enabling shared IRQ
support.
Arjan, the patch you sent does cause the lockdep message to disappear,
but the card doesn't work.  When I plug an ethernet cable into the card,
neither the 10 or 100 LED lights up.  I tried running
"modprobe <modname> debug=1" on 8390 and pcnet_cs, but neither seem
to support modprobe options.  I am recompiling with debugging enabled by
tweaking the debugging values in the files.  I'll send you any useful debug
info I gather.
