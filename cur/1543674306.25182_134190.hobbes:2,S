Absolutely. Not to mention the code for the in-kernel algorithm has
historically broken i386 ports using certain modes of Intel's
interrupt controllers.
Far better would be to validate that the affinity specified is feasible
to program into the interrupt controller in a system call and leave the
algorithm to userspace.
