Yes for this case. The original was likely so fragile that it might
break only with minor changes in the hardware configuration.
In general listing known regressions is a good idea though.
It might be a good idea to give them different priorities though - e.g.
a broken BIOS with a missing workaround is less priority than
a pure Linux bug.
