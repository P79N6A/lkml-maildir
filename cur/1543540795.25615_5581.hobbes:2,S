Well I don't hang around long enough to check. This is a code-snippit
of my init in the embedded system:
        }
        if(pars->status & STAT_REBOOT)
        {
            DEB(puts("Reboot command received"));
            pars->status &= ~STAT_REBOOT;
            do {
                    YIELD;
                } while(!!pars->reboot);
            DEB(puts("Killing all children"));
            (void)kill(-1, SIGTERM);
            (void)sleep(1);
            (void)kill(-1, SIGKILL);
            (void)sleep(1);
            DEB(puts("Rebooting the machine"));
            (void)sleep(1);
            (void)reboot(RB_AUTOBOOT);
        } 
YIELD is a macro doing usleep(0x10). This is because sched_yield()
just spins, doesn't actually work.
A pars->status is shared memory. A control-task ORs in a STAT_REBOOT flag
into pars->status and sends a signal to init. Init gets the signal
and executes this code. This code waits until the control-task has
reset 'pars->reboot' (the control-task is rebooting another host).
Then the code sends fatal signals to everyone. This, I think, should
have closed all the connections. However, with 2.2.15, they only
get closed after the machine is back up (because of a RST??), not
before the machine shuts down.
This creates a problem if the topography looks like this:
	machine1-->machine2-->machine3-->.....machineN
When told to reboot, these machines should "fold-back" from
machine N -> machine1, with the first machine being the last
to reboot. When machine1 comes back up, the other machines
should have already rebooted. The boot sequence takes 10 seconds.
I should be able to reboot the whole chain in slightly more than
10 seconds. Instead, since machine1 doesn't get a disconnect until
machine2 has actually booted, the reboot time ends up being 10*N
seconds where N is the number of hosts. Imagine 30 of these in a
chain (300 seconds = 5 minutes), NotGood(tm).
Now, I notice that if I sleep for about 10 seconds, most connections
do get shut down. However, that makes the reboot sequence take
300 seconds again.
