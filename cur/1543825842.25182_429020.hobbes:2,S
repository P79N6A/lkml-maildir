If you're expecting kernel developers to unpack your text file and read 
through 40555(!!!) lines of text to find out what's wrong...
Please try to explain your problem better with some before / after 
comparisons that fit nicely into an email and point out specifically 
where you think it went wrong. Also describe what you're trying to do 
and what kind of hardware you're using.
For more detailed information on how to report kernel bugs, please read 
the file REPORTING-BUGS in the main kernel source directory.
Please don't see this as a "we don't care" message. If the kernel has 
indeed a bug we very much do care! We just can't go through thousands of 
lines of text to try to understand what the problem is... :(
