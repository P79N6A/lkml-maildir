Overlapping ioctls prevent strace(1) from showing ioctls properly.
For example, here's something you see often in strace of programs
using stdio, when it calls isatty():
ioctl(1, SNDCTL_TMR_TIMEBASE or TCGETS, 0xbfaaa864) = -1 ENOTTY (Inappropriate ioctl for device)
Or if it is a terminal:
ioctl(1, SNDCTL_TMR_TIMEBASE or TCGETS, {c_iflags=0x6d02, c_oflags=0x5, c_cflags=0x4bf, c_lflags=0x8a3b, c_line=0, c_cc="\x03\x1c\x7f\x15\x04\x00\x01\xff\x11\x13\x1a\xff\x12\x0f\x17\x16\xff\x00\x00"}) = 0
