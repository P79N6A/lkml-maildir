John,
 do you recall from which to which version of the BIOS your upgrade
went? The upgrade procedure for the s2462 implies a W98 boot floppy
(never ever seen one of those :-) and it also strongly reccommends
flashing the CMOS memory. As this involves playing with jumpers on the
MB and I have 9 of them screwed into a rack, I hesitate to go that
path.... As I wrote the MBs are at 2.09 and the newest version from Tyan
is 2.10, with a not very interesting list of fixes/enhancements.
Martin
