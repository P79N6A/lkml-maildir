Hi,
                Thanks in advance for any
clarifications.
                I was trying to analyze a few machine 
checksum errors,  and obtained a lot of valuable
information in the archive,  including a 
referrence to Dave Jones' tool,  parsemce. Thanks !
              The servers that we get these occasional
errors on, are mostly dual AMD boxes (MP 1800s, 
typically) running 2.4.18.  Are the decoding rules, 
present in Intel's IA-32 MCA documentation, applicable
on these servers ? As detailed in Intel's 
Software Developer's Manual, looks like  it is not 
mandatory for an IA-32 compliant system to follow the 
decoding rules on all the fields in the machine status
registers (e.g the ones that indicate Uncorrectable 
ECC errors)..
             Appreciate any help regarding this.
-thanks,
Atish
