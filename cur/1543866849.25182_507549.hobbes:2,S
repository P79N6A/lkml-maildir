I am assuming you mean interrupts disabled at the ioapic.  If that
is true mostly I agree with your assertion.
If you look above the mask is where I disable that interrupt source on
the ioapic.  I then send an ipi to all of the other possible cpus and
read the local apic to ensure that the window is over in which I need
to handle interrupts at the old destination. 
If I don't know when the window ends I can never dismantle the data
structures for receiving the irq at the old destination.  Ouch!
If I know how long I have to wait until I can clean up the data
structure at the old destination I don't have to worry about
overlapping interrupts.
Therefore it doesn't by me anything but complexity to setup the data
structures on the new cpu before the window for receiving the irqs
has completed.
Make sense?
