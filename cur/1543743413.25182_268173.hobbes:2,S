    Just use ps to reveal the family tree. Is not that hard ;)

    But that's OK :))) When a parent dies without waiting for its
children, the zombies are reparented to init. That's correct. Then
init will wait for them. The problem is that sometimes the signals
doesn't arrive or the like. Then the zombies are laying around a bit,
until a timer in 'init' reaps them. That's correct too: init can only
wait for children when it receives SIGCHLD or periodically, using a
timer. I've written a init program and that's the way I do it, just
in case some signal gets lost.
    If init is the parent, all works ok, just wait a bit and all
those zombies will really die ;)
