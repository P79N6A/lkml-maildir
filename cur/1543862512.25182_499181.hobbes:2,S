Looking at 2.6.20-rc5 now...
550: ret = upload_dma_data(sscape, bb->code, sizeof(bb->code));
665: if ( !access_ok(VERIFY_READ, bb->code, sizeof(bb->code)) )
Here's a test:
$ cat x.c
/*1*/ struct foo {
/*2*/     char bar[256];
/*3*/ };
/*4*/ int main(void) {
/*5*/     struct foo tmp;
/*6*/     char *x = tmp.bar;
/*7*/     char *y = &tmp.bar;
/*8*/     return 0;
/*9*/ }
$ cc x.c -Wall
x.c:7: warning: initialization from incompatible pointer type
Hence, &bb->code would be wrong. Really. (Talk to ##c or comp.lang.c
perhaps on details.)

Same. sic->code decays into a char* when used.
This gets boring, I won't look at the others.
