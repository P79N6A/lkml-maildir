Hello,
my usb-storage doesn't work with linux.
What i have:
Kernel 2.6.0-test9
USB 2.0 mobile disk
The problem:
trying to access this device after loading usb modules, dmesg shows the
following:
USB Mass Storage support registered.
SCSI device sda: 117231408 512-byte hdwr sectors (60022 MB)
sda: assuming drive cache: write through
 sda: sda1
Attached scsi disk sda at scsi0, channel 0, id 0, lun 0
scsi: Device offlined - not ready after error recovery: host 0 channel 0
id 0 lun 0
SCSI error : <0 0 0 0> return code = 0x6070000
end_request: I/O error, dev sda, sector 128

Buffer I/O error on device sda, logical block 20
Buffer I/O error on device sda, logical block 21
Buffer I/O error on device sda, logical block 22
...
The hardware *works* correctly, i tried in with win2k and this works
without problems.
I have another usb storage and this works correctly with kernel
2.6.0-test9!
Any ideas?
I have found this problem often in different mailing lists, but with no
solution.
Perhaps it is a bug.
regards,
hampel
