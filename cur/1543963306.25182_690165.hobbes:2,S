Very early in the boot, the timestamp counter fetching infrastructure
isn't setup yet.  So zero is reported for the timestamp.
So early on in the boot, it is often not even possible to setup
such things yet.  Because infrastructure they need for probing
etc. isn't even available yet.
This happens on basically every single Linux platform, there
isn't really anything to fix.
