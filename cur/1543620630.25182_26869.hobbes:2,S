I've picked up ide.2.4.17.02072002.patch from www.linux-ide.org
and compiled it with 2.4.17. I presume that this was the patch
you were referring to?
With Andre's IDE patch and 2.4.17, my machine locked up when 
compiling 2.4.17 with both the DMA on and the DMA off.
With patch-2.4.18-pre9, the machine only locked up when
DMA was set on, with DMA off, I could recompile the kernel
as many times as I wanted. 
Following are kernel messages from the kernel boot with
Andre's IDE patch.
