Thanks for your input.  However, I do not want the application to work 
remotely.  I have examined all other options, and this is the best way to 
do it under the circumstances which I need this program to work.
The question is not one of "how" to accomplish all of this, it is how to 
get inb(0x64) to state that it is indeed mouse movement, and not keyboard 
data, on an AMD Athlon XP system with PS/2 mouse.
Thanks again!
Brett
