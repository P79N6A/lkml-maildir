Can you remind me why this isn't in vm_ops?
Also, it is going to be hugepage-only, isn't it? So should the naming be
changed to reflect that? And #ifdef it...

I got dibs on fault ;)
My callback is a sanitised one that basically abstracts the details of the
virtual memory mapping away, so it is usable by drivers and filesystems.
You actually want to bypass the normal fault handling because it doesn't
know how to deal with your virtual memory mapping. Hmm, the best suggestion
I can come up with is handle_mm_fault... unless you can think of a better
name for me to use.
