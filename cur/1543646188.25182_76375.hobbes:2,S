Hello,
    This patch updates the emu10k1 driver to its 0.19a version so that
audigy cards should work under 2.5.x without needing ALSA.  This is a 
resend of this patch with the attachment as a bz2 file instead of being 
plain text, this is because my previous two mails have never managed to 
hit the list, sorry if they ever do and this is yet another post of the 
same patch.  Thanks.
Jordan
