Well, I have managed to successfully modify the Makefile. I separated the 2
target as you wanted to. I have written a patch for you and Sam Ravnborg.
Nevertheless, I have a small problem: I did not manage to use gcc rather than
g++ in the Makefile. This has a side effect: libglade can not connect signals
to the GUI (because it uses symbol names for doing the binding and symbol 
decoration is not the same between C & C++).
I need help for this problem.
