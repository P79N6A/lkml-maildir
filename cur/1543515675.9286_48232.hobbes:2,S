   After trying kernels 2.3.22, 2.3.23 and 2.3.26 i finally got my system to
   come all the way up by forcing fsck to check my drives serially...
   Before this I was getting signal 10 (operational error, reboot) on
   /dev/hda7. 
Signal 10 means you're running e2fsprogs 1.16; it was a bug fixed in
1.17, and 1.18 was just released.  I suggest you upgrade to e2fsprogs
1.18, and it should solve your problem.
