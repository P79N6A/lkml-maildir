v2.4 does not suffer from the issue mentioned by Guninski because 
the first argument of the arithmetic comparison is not casted
to a "signed" value:
  n = min((ssize_t)*nr, n);
That was the problem in v2.6, where an unsigned value bigger than 2^31 
would be treated as a negative signed.
Thanks anyway for pinging me, highly appreciated.
