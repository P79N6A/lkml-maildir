Some archs already have an atomic_dec_if_positive() (see for instance
the PPC). It won't take much work to convert that to an
atomic_inc_if_positive().
For those arches that don't have that sort of thing, then writing a
generic atomic_inc_if_positive() using cmpxchg() will often be possible,
but there are exceptions (for instance the original 386 does not have a
cmpxchg, so there you will have to use something else).
