Standard * always requires a stack, it's a recursive problem unless
you change the semantics to non greedy. While you can open code the
stack it would be be easier to just limit the recursion.  Not more than 
10 or so should be plenty.
But the other problem is that Linux doesn't accept anonymous code 
contributions.
