My thanks to those who have replied so far; however, I seem to have asked
the wrong questions.  I already know that IDE-SCSI is required to make
CD-R burners work:  I have two of them at home.  ;-) 
I'm more interested in things that the IDE CD driver can do that IDE-SCSI
+ SCSI-CDROM can't.  I am tempted to create a kernel binary, for possible
distribution to N people on CD, that contains the IDE-SCSI emulation layer
and SCSI CD-ROM support _instead of_ IDE-CDROM support.  This makes IDE
CD-R drivers work, among other things.
Is this a good idea?  So far the only problem I've heard about is that
CD changers don't work through the IDE-SCSI layer (I used to have one of
those, too, but unfortunately I don't any more).  Is there some equivalent
SCSI command that can be sent to such drivers through the IDE-SCSI layer?
