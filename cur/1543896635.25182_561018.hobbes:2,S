Sometimes I think one of the problems with Linux is that it tries to do 
everything for everyone.
That's not a bad thing - until you look at the complexity it brings - and then 
consider the impact and exceptions when you do, eg hardware acceleration? md 
information fed up to the fs layer for xfs? simple long term maintenance?
Often these problems are well worth the benefits of the feature.
I _wonder_ if this is one where the right thing is to "just say no" :)
