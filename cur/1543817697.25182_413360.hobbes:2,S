Around 2.6.13, I noticed that EHCI stopped working after a suspend/resume
(to/from RAM) cycle.  So I updated my suspend script to unload/reload EHCI
each time, which fixed the problem for me.  My script still does that.
Dunno if it's fixed in mainline or not.
Does unloading/reloading EHCI help you?
   rmmod ehci_hcd ; modprobe ehci_hcd
