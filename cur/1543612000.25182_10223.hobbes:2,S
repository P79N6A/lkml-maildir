I certainly agree that the PCI DMA interface shouldn't be tweaked just
because of IA64.  What I'm wondering is whether we'll have to tweak it
anyhow to more gracefully handle the case where a hardware I/O TLB
runs out of space.  If so, I think the software I/O TLB makes sense.

Well, I won't comment on *this* one! ;-))
