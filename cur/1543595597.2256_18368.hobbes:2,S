How does socket(), bind() and other BSD socket API
calls in user applications are handled by system
socketcall(). Does the compiler (say gcc) substitute
socket() in user app with socketcall(SYS_SOCKET,..)?
Also, why don't I see _syscallN() macro for socketcall
or any other BSD socket calls? 
I'd greatly appreciate your help.
