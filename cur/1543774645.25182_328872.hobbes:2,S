Nope, they're not identical.  The first specifically unzips it into the file
system, leaving the zip file intact.  The second, you're having to take all
those .o files and other stuff that the 'make' generates and put them back
into the .zip file *on the fly* - when the 'make' is half done, the .zip should
reflect a directory tree that has had half the make execute....
(Think - after that hyptothetical 'make' completes, where is 'vmlinux'? ;)
