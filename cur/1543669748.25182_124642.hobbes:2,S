It's been three days since I applied the patch. No tty hangings have been
happening. From what I've tested the patch you've given works great. 
Please consider applying to next BK snapshot.
Shawn.

Applying akpm's patch now, expect a result in 1-2 days since that's how long
it takes to begin to destabilize :-)

Ah, I see... your patch that added insert_sequence and remove_sequence
was intended to apply on top of the patch that adds
cancel_delayed_work().
Please ignore the reply to your patch that I just sent, I
misunderstood what you were trying to do.
Shawn, I think if you add Andrew's most recent patch on top of what
you were running with, your problem should probably be fixed.
Sorry for the extra noise.
