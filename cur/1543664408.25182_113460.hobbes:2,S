(I'm using 2.4.18; is
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/rml/vm/strict-overcommit/v2.4/vm-strict-overcommit-rml-2.4.18-1.patch
still the approprate patch for that?)

Even with overcommit disallowed, the OOM killer is going to run
when my users try to run too big a job, so I would still like
the OOM killer to behave "well".

We do not see fork explosions in our workload, but if we did,
we could abuse the RSS limit for now by setting it to zero except for
the processes we wanted to protect from the OOM killer.
If that works in practice the same idea could be done without the abuse;
the RSS limit is just a handy knob.
