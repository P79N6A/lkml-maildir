For the record, I was seeing the same problem with 2.6.15-rc5 (it
wasn't there on 2.6.12), but the thread I'm replying to isolated the
problem patch.
A workaround here (Phoenix BIOS, Dual Opteron 275, 8GB RAM, 1.02.2895,
Tyan Thunder K8WE (S2895)) is to set the following in BIOS:
* Set Operating System to "Linux"
* Hammer Configuration->Memory Hole->IOMMU set to Enable
* Hammer Configuration->MTRR mapping set to "Discrete"
No idea why this fixes it, nor why it wasn't necessary before,
but it at least boots now.
It hangs in a pretty cryptic way on a default config kernel (well, Ubuntu
Dapper defaults) so it would be nice if this was resolved.
