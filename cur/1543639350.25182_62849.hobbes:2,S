Hi there,
How can i mount a FreeBSD Partion with a Blocksize of 16384
mount -t ufs -o ufstype=44bsd /dev/hda1 /mnt/fbsd 
doesn't seems to work?
WRONG ufs type may currupt your file-system etc. , but im still happy if
it would work even rdonly.
Is there a global option to aply changing the blocksize in 
ufs*.c  from 8192 to 16384?
