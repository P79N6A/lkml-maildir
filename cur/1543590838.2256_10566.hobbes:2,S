Understanding the layout of a dynamic disk is just a part of the problem
as far as I can see it.
What if I have two (three,four) dynamic disks with volumes organized into a 
software stripe (raid0) under Windows?
There must be an implementation of MS' software raid in the linux kernel in 
order to access that "striped filesystem"  under linux, I'm I right?
