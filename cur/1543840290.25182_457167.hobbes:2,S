Hmm.. you are the security expert here :-). But it still needs private
key while accessing the net.. so even if it does read from
~/.ssh/private_key, first,  what stops mozilla from waiting for
ssh to start talking on the network, and then read the key from ssh's
memory?
Do you have examples where this security model stops an attack?
