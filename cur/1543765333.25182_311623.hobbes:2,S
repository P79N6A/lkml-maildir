They can use the in-kernel GART driver just fine. Of course, they choose
to take a bastardised version from some ancient tree, mangle it to
all hell, strip off the GPL MODULE_VERSION, and weld it to their
own driver, but that's their decision. Which is btw, whats partly
causing your problem.  (They still would've needed to change some
code, but the AGP side of the fence would be taken care of).
