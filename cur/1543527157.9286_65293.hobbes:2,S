Subject: mmap problem... Can Anyone help?

Hi,
I statically linked my program and I tried to mmap
a total of 2 GB - 4096 bytes.
Now when I call mmap with a start address of 0x40000000 and used the
MAP_FIXED flag, it works and Im able to use all my virtual memory correctly.
But with out the MAP_FIXED flag, mmap returns -1.
Why is this?
I thought at the very least not using MAP_FIXED should find any suitable
address, even 0x40000000 like I specified.
Thanks!
