Careful.
The VM space is shared _separately_ from other data structures, which
means that you can _not_ user per-VM virtual address areas and expect them 
to scale with load. And than some VM happens to have thousands of threads, 
and you're dead.

Kernel stacks most certainly can't do this easily, since you'll just hit 
the scalability problem somewhere else (ie many threads, same VM). 
And files, for example, can not only be many files for one VM, you can 
have the reverse too, ie many VM's, one file table.
