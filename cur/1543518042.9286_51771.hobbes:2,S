Stack usage it not critical (the conversion functions could eat 800
bytes without any problems) _except_ in semctl_main() and sys_semop().
sys_semop():
uses "struct sembuf", you didn't change that structure, no conversion
needed.
semctl_main(): 
only GETALL and SETALL need lots of stack space, and only IPC_STAT needs
a conversion function.
I think you can safely ignore the stack problem:
even _if_ semctl_main() needs to much stack space [I doubt that], it
would be easy to
* decrease SEMMSL_FAST
* or split semctl_main().
