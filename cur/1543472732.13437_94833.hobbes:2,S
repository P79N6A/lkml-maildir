        PS. Whot does this have in common with the inner workings of the
        Linux kernel?
    All the detailed questions about the inner workings of Linux would be
    of no importance to anyone, if we did not have an operating system to
    use it in.  And that operating system was developed for idealistic
    reasons.
    Freedom includes the right to sneer at freedom; no one can force you
    to care about anything.  But that won't change the fact that the
    idealism you despise is the reason why your operating system exists,
    and the reason why it is free software.  And the system is likely to
    remain free, only as long as people who care about their freedom make
    the effort to keep it free.
Probably, many of us wouldn't notice its absence.
