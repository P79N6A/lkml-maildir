Folks, I'm trying to track down hardware so we can support BK on the
StrongARM.  If anyone has one or two Netwinders sitting gathering dust,
could you contact me privately and let me know what you want for them.
And does anyone know where Sam Menhat (spelling?) ended up?  I'll bet
he knows where there are some of these.
Thanks in advance.
