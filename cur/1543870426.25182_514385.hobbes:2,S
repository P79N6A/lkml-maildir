Yes, that is sensible.  Something akin to on_each_cpu(synchronize_tscs) 
would certainly not like interrupts coming in.  Similarly, acpi_nmi 
disable and probably rcu barriers as well.  The irq disable here can 
very validly be used as a barrier, but trying to ensure preserved shared 
state with irq handlers over the call is a bug.
If one had all the spare time in the world, a new "sense" of irq disable 
that communicated this fact would be nice from a static or dynamic 
checking perspective.
