Hello My Friend.
As you read through my message, I do not want you to 
feel pity or sorry for me, for I believe someday, somehow, we will all 
surely die, this is about mine, and a last wish. 
My name is Mr.Wylo 
Wylos  Jr, a Citizen of the Republic of Mauritius, I have cancer and it 
is terminal, medical science can not do anything for me at  this stage. 
I believe in miracles because I believe in GOD, however I prefer  to 
pass on at this stage since I am bed ridden and in constant in. Having 
known my condition I decided to entrust some fund I have ( USD 2 
Million) deposited in Europe to either a philanthropic organization or 
devoted individual that 
will utilize this money the way I am going to 
instructs. 
10% of the money goes to you to ensure that you are 
prepared for the task ahead, the balance 90% of this money will be used 
in all sincerity to fund philanthropic organization, orphanages. I am 
taking this decision because I don't have any child or devoted 
relations whose behavior has left much to be desired and above all I 
don't want a situation where this money will be used in an unGodly 
manner, hence this bold decision. Since my health 
is retrogressing by 
the minute, you will have to send your; POSTAL ADDRESS, CONTACT PHONE 
NUMBER AND FAX and a little details about yourself, because I got your 
address from the Internet after a thorough search. 
With the 
information, I will make arrangement to prepare the  Authorization 
through an Attorney for you to get Possession of the Deposit. I will  
give you the name and contact of the Deposit company where the money is 
lodged in Europe thereafter, so you can claim the funds. Until I hear 
from you, I pray that this letter bring you and your family good 
tidings.

God be with you. 
Mr. Wylo
