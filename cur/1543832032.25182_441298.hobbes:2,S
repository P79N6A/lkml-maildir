It needs a comment to prevent people from breaking it in the future, and
to help people who are trying to work out why the heck the kernel is
looking for a particular state in something which hasn't been set to that
state.
Also, it's a bit odd that we've gone and left a hole in the enum space.
Wouldn't it be better to sort out our initialisation so we don't actually
need this memset-equals-pci_channel_io_normal trick?  pci_scan_device()
looks like a good place..
