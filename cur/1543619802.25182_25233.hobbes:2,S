Of course not. How can I be sure???

Won't work. Then all I get is (ref prob #1) good throughput until RAMx2
bytes is read from disk. Then it all falls down to ~1MB/s. See
http://karlsbakk.net/dev/kernel/vm-fsckup.txt
 for more details.

Then fix the problem rmap11c fixed. I first need that fixed before being
able to do any further testing!
