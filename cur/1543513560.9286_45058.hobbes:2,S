There's a problem that doesn't show up on intel, and that is that
flush_page_to_ram() is called with inconsistent arguments.  Sometimes it's
a struct page * (mm/filemap.c and mm/memory.c), in other cases it's a
kernel virtual address (e.g. kernel/ptrace.c, include/linux/highmem.h).
I'm inclined to think it should be a kernel virtual address.  Comments?
Regards,
Paul.
