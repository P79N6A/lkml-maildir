Ok. You are right. Maybe "try_to_readahead" should be extended to keep
track of backwards (or forwards if the user reading backwards) usage, as
it does now for forward usage. This way, you keep track of an "active
window" within the file, and the rest can be treated as "use me first",
keeping the cache-trashing footprint of the app to the window-size.
