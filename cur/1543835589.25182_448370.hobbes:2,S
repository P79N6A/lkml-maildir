Patches? I read the *patches*. :)  What I missed was this:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=115412601229175&w=2
was the only thing I found (over in the 5/5 thread) that remotely looked
like an actual workable test, and all Arjan said was:

I admit missing that one, because it wasn't actually a patch, but a commentary
I managed to not read and digest in detail (in particular, it wasn't at all
clear that his one-liner would DTRT re: PR28281...)
