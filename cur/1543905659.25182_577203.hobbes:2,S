get_user_pages() essentially walks through the requested user address
space, faults in pages if necessary, and returns references to those
pages.
The logic of get_user_pages() you need to be concerned about is
this inner loop:
			while (!(page = follow_page(vma, start, foll_flags))) {
				int ret;
				ret = handle_mm_fault(mm, vma, start,
						foll_flags & FOLL_WRITE);
 ...
			}
handle_mm_fault() does all the dirty work of a page fault, and
is how we get to update_mmu_cache(), the sun4c implementation of
which is where you see the crash.
