    I have seen very similar symptoms in two ISA eepro cards.  I found that,
if I kept a `ping` process running on the machine with an eepro installed,
the card would work okay, but somewhat slowly.  Otherwise it would just
hang, and had to be restarted to work again.
    (Note: this was a few weeks ago, and I'm not using any of my eepro cards
because of it anymore.  I haven't tried the new(ly maintained) driver.)
    It would be interesting to find that this is a more general problem; a
good bit of the reason why I've never reported it is because my eepro cards
are old and suspect themselves.
