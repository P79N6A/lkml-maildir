Hi,
I've got a UDMA66 drive on a HPT370 controller. Whenever I issue a command
to switch to a higher DMA mode ("hdparm -X67" or "-X68") the machine locks
completely - no response to Magic SysRq at all.
The drive starts in udma2 upon bootup (it's a "Nikimi NIK-XL300A", not a
brand I've seen before). I've not tried it with other devices on this
controller, but a Maxtor 53073H6 starts straight in udma5, so I tend not to
want to switch it down to a lower DMA mode.
This happens on 2.4.0-test9, and -test10-pre4, although I suspect it's
happened on others too.
