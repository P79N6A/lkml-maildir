Yeah. It increases memory pressure for the _complex_ and _slow_ 
algorithms. Agreed.
See my two-liner suggestion (which is admittedly not even compiled, so the
one disadvantage it might have is that it might need to be debugged. But
it's only two lines and doesn't actually change any fundamental part of
any existing algorithms, so debugging shouldn't be a big problem.
