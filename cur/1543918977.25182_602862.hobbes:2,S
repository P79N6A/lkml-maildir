Hi Steve,
  What you describe is exactly what I did.  The IRQF_NODELAY handler
just minimally checks to see if the character is a sysrq related one (or
KDB, if you have the KDB patches applied).  If it is not, it puts the
character into a ring-buffer and wakes a (kthread-based) tasklet to do
the normal serial/tty rx path by processing the ring.
Hope that helps to clarify.
Regards,
-Greg
