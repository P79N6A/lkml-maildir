I meant that I have the image as a PNG (whatever), captured from the display
of the remote control program (HP RILOE, VMWare GSX Console, VNC, whatever).
I'm aware that the VGA display memory holds the characters (in addition to
pixels) in text mode, but the actual machine may be dead at this point - OS
crash, hw failure, whatever. The oops output is on the screen - just not in
palatible text format.
