No it's not, only in the private namespace.

Seems like a matter of preference, but I see what you're saying.

Ok, I see.

In fact I suspect we could show that they are functionally equivalent
(for your purposes) by drawing the fs tree and peer groups from
current->fs->root on up for both methods.
And not using private namespaces leaves the admin (at least for now)
better able to diagnose the state of the system.
