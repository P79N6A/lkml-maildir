Exactly.
And then init spawns your getty again, and you log in again, and you
continue doing what you were doing.
Or you could just let it not kill the process doing the killing, and
you'd be more productive.
My point is that I can't see a valid case where we _actually want_ -1 to
send to itself also.  Yes, I know the standards don't mention this.  They
also don't explicity disallow not sending to the originating process, so
I don't see what the big problem is.
Does anybody have a case where including itself is actually useful?
