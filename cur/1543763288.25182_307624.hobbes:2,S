I was looking at current bk where it looks like this:
asmlinkage long sys_time(time_t __user * tloc)
{
        time_t i;
        struct timeval tv;
        do_gettimeofday(&tv);
        i = tv.tv_sec;
        if (tloc) {
                if (put_user(i,tloc))
                        i = -EFAULT;
        }
        return i;
}
I have no idea when it changed.
