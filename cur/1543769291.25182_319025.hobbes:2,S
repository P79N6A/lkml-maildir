mynew is for beginner programmers (and perl scripts!).  The normal
convention is to add a "k" as in printk or ksoftirqd, so it should be
"knew". But who knew?
Besides, what programs are you compiling that are using kernel headers?
That's always a no-no. Although I did notice that errno.h on debian
includes bits/errno.h which includes linux/errno.h. But that's the
distribution's linux headers, and I don't see any header including
asm/system.h

Is this a joke? It doesn't make sense sending a disclaimer like this to
a mailing list!
