There are four cases to consider here.
Case 1: parent fs watched and child fs watched
	correct results
Case 2: parent fs watched and child fs not watched
	We may not deliver an event that should be delivered.
Case 3: parent fs not watched and child fs watched
	We take d_lock when we don't need to
Case 4: parent fs not watched and child fs not watched
	correct results
Case 2 screws us. We have to take the lock to even look at the parent's
dentry->d_sb->s_inotify_watches. I don't know of a way around this one.
