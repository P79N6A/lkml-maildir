I build the whole thing, daily. from scratch, without
ccache, with something that isn't too far from a
make allmodconfig, on a half dozen different architectures
(with multiple builds for each sometimes - 586/686,
 various ppc flavours etc).
Our build system spits out 2.6 kernel RPMs not noticably
slower their 2.4 counterparts, which were also pretty
close to a make allmodconfig.
If the builds took _twice_ as long, I would've been
shouting from the rooftops long ago.  
The factors you mention make it sound like something is
very very wrong somewhere, but there's no clear sign why
this is affecting you so badly. Maybe you should try
profiling things and find out where the additional time
is being spent.

How much RAM do you have ?  And are you using the same
version of gcc for both 2.4 and 2.6 builds ?
