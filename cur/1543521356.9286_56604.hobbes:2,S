Like your ability to read? FYI: one of the worst things about block
drivers-to-kernel interface is that they share it with files. I.e. _any_
change in file_operations or in struct file or in struct inode and you are
deep in it. Change the size of any field prior to ->i_dev and you are in
for recompile. Change <gasp> device number bitness and even recompile may
be of little help. Removing those dependencies (not all of them are
removed yet, more will follow) is going to save _your_ ass a year later.
Said that, if your position includes the kernel work and you can't tell
Becker's drivers from the block devices... I'm not sure that your ass is
worth saving. And if you are going to use block devices for DSP - you
ought to start looking for new job. Preferably in a different field.
