We might lose your contributions, that's true, I've never ever denied
that.  And this will even have a cost for you, especially if you go
proprietary rather than some other more liberal Free Software license,
or stick with a GPLv2 Linux and hope it's never ruled as prohibiting
tivoization, or move to Linux on ROM.
But it takes only a small fraction of the tivoizers to decide to take
out the locks, when faced with the costs mentioned above, for us to
gain contributions from even a small fraction of their user base
(which would then grow in hacker density as a result of
non-tivoization) for us to end up better off.
Or so I believe ;-)
