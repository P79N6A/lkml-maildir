Hmm.. Where's the dereference? I don't disagree with the patch per se, but 
I don't see any real problem.
The mm->mm_users check is protected by "tsk->clear_child_tid", and that 
will have been cleared already if we ever happen to call __exit_mm() 
twice, so that one is safe.
So this patch might be a cleanup, but not a "fix" per se.
