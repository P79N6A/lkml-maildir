No, I don't think so. debufs has been my choice for the user interface.
But it is only one aspect of the statistics infrastructure, not even the

but an exploitation. And the statistics code could be changed to use
something else than debugfs with moderate effort.

Looked for it without success.
I am not consistent as to */ or **/ at the end of kerneldoc comments, yet.
