VERY FUNNY, Alan!
2.4.9-ac9: __alloc_pages:
        /* No luck.. */
//      printk(KERN_ERR "__alloc_pages: %lu-order allocation failed.\n", order)
        return NULL;
If there is no printk, you will obviously not notice the problem. You can bet
your car on not "seeing the problem".

Well, as long as you do not use any features that made you install 2.4 before,
e.g. files > 2GB and some others. Of course, if you do not use these, you might
be better of with 2.2 anyway.
That was not a very convincing comment, Alan.
But I must admit one thing: 2.4.9-ac9 runs smoother in my test. There are no
delays experienced during which the system desperately seeks mem. In fact I can
see a lot of inact_clean nearly all the time (a lot means 200-600 MB).
Nevertheless there _is_ a problem, because nfs still fails on low mem situation
when option "no_subtree_check" is _off_/not used.
I will have some closer looks on ac tree.
Regards,
Stephan
