Hey all !
         I am thinking to use ski simulator as I can get the ia64
(Itanium 2)simulated on ia32 archi....So can I use this product for
the project related to huge page size ???
       Will the problems related to huge pages such as
swapping,IO,etc...will be covered if I use ski with 2.6 kernel image
configured for ia64 archi with huge page size support ?????
     Thank You....
