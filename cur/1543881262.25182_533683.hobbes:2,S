and bisection shows that this patch is where it starts happening.
I see no way in which this patch can cause ASSERT_RTNL to start triggering. 
Could be the there are dynamic changes which are triggering some problem in
the networking tree, but the net code looks straightforward enough.
Anyway, after a few such traces things seem to settle down and there are no
apparent problems, so I guess I'll just ship it as-is.
