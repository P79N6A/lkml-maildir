Hi Chuck,
I finally got it. Problem and solution have been found from 6 month but 
nobody cared...up to now those servers have not been mantained, this 
problem is not discussed anywhere else than the following link.
The bug (userspace server side i would say at this point) is well 
described from the author of an nfs-user-server patch which has not been 
managed yet. The magic hint to find it on google was 'nfs server 
utimensat' :-)
http://marc.info/?l=linux-nfs&m=118724649406144&w=2
I have already prepared a working patch for cfsd based upon the one ive 
listed. The nfs patch is of course waiting for commit since august, 
2007. Ill submit it to debian cfsd mantainers, hoping to have more 
chance than my predecessor.
It doesnt seem to me that there was any kernel related issue.
Thanks a lot again, sorry for the lots of noise i have done. I will try 
to be more appropriate next time.
Cheers,
Gianluca
