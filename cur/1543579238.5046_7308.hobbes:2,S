We set TCP_CORK on the socket we handed to external programs that were
being run via 'site exec' in an ftp server.  It resulted in much nicer
packets being spit out, especially in the 'ls' case where it likes to
write() on really goofy boundaries.
[yes, ftp and 'site exec' in particular are far from sexy, but do the same
with CGI scripts and the world might care :)]
