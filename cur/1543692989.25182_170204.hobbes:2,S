I was more thinking of running Xen on one node of a cluster,
using it as the management tool.
Each user gets his own VM on the master node,
and can only access that.
A real value would be if one could use the
cluster resources from within a e.g. freebsd guest.
So the question would be, can the processes of the
guest OS be migrated to to other nodes?
(openmosix can only migrate the userspace part of a process)
Anyways i will try it next week.
aha
