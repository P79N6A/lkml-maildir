While at Linux Kongress, I found the following credo at
one of the toilets of the university where the event was
hosted:
	"Stop studying, start thinking"
Now I'm /certain/ that the toilet is the only place in
a university where people actually take the time to sit
down and THINK about issues...
cheers,
Rik
