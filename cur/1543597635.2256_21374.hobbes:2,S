I agree.  I had my computer mildy overclocked for a little while.  Everything
ran just great, I could compile kernels, quake3 timedemo for two days, etc.  
All was well until I tried to compile gcc itself and I kept getting random
errors.  I finally opened up the case and bumped it back down, and like magic
it compiled just fine.  
So my advice would be to don't overclock.
