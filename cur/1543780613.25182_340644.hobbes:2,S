ACK, but
1) I wouldn't want an exploited service to gain any privileges, even by
   chaining userspace exploits (e.g. exec sendmail < exploitstring).  For
   most services, I'd like CAP_EXEC being unset (but it doesn't exist).
2) There are environments (linux-vserver.org) which limit root to a subset
   of capabilities. I think they might use that feature, too. Off cause a
   simple "suid bit" == "all capabilities" scheme won't work there.
