Please, upgrade to the latest 2.6.0-test kernel, as there are a lot of
people working on the CPU scheduler and interactivity. As of this mail,
it's 2.6.0-test2-bk4. If you prefer, you can also test 2.6.0-test2-mm4
(Andrew Morton patches on top of 2.6.0-test2).
This way, you can help us in improving the interactive feeling of future
2.6 kernels.
