Alternatively, how about using PAM to grant the CAP_SYS_NICE capability to
known interactive users that require it. Presumably the number of users
that require it is very small (in the case of the music player, only one)
so it wouldn't be a major security issue.
There is something along these lines at 
http://www.pamcap.org
 but it
requires some patching to the kernel (only available against 2.4.18
currently) to inherit capabilities across exec and, from what I gather at
a quick glance, to allow capabilities to be set for a process group.
