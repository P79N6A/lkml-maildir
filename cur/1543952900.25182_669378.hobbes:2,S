How many physical processors does it have?

Did you set /proc/sys/kernel/sched_compat_yield=1 before testing? If not,
pls. configure it.

On my stoakley (2 quad-core processors, 2.66GHz), with jrockit-R27.3.1-jre1.5.0_11.x86_64:
v2.6.22:363062
v2.6.24:390248
v2.6.25-rc3:210276
v2.6.25-rc4:379704
v2.6.25-rc5:377723
v2.6.25-rc6:322864
The regression is reproducible.
On another tigerton(4 quad-core processors, 2.93GHz):
v2.6.25-rc5:577752
v2.6.25-rc6:579936
So there is no regression on tigerton.

I will try openjdk.
