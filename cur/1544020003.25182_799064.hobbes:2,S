At one point in time the virtual clock allowed control for a set of clocks with some dependencies.  The mpu alias provided a convenient control point.
Tukka did original omap1 in this format. I forget its exact meaning.
The original omap2 code had behavior:
        - mpu-dpll had a clock node which allowed direct mpu speed control
        - mpu-virt-clock allowed switching between sets that have fixed ratio dependency which were pegged to current mpu-dll speed.
                * This way round_rate would allow you to discover all valid OPPs.
The first pass OMAP3 code TI did followed omap2 but it wasn't strongly bound by ratio-sets given the multiple async-dplls. Paul has taken code in a bit different direction.  He can comment on current behavior here.
