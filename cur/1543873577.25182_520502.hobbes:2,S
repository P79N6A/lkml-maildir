Please all, forget about MAP_GROWSDOWN.  It's useless.  If thread
stacks are not completely mapped (address space allocation, memory
allocation is not needed) it means subsequent unrelated mmaps can fall
into the address space which is meant to be used for the stack, hence
preventing the stack from growing.
libpthread uses an mmap for the complete stack size all the time and
this of course is accounted for in the kernel.
