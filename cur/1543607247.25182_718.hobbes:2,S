I wasn't really asking about changing root after the system is up, the
part needed is the uncompressing of the filesystem into a ramdisk root f/s
or some such. After that it's pretty much open to any of several techniques.
Getting the modules loaded to support the root f/s and run a little rc
file to get things going is the bootstrap operation, and that's where
initrd is vital. You really don't want to build a kernel for every
machine if you have more than a few! One kernel and a few config and
initrd files is vastly easier.
What replaces the initial step?

  His first management concern is not solving the problem, but covering
his ass. If he lived in the middle ages he'd wear his codpiece backward.
