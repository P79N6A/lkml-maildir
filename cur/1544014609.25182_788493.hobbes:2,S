Ah, so now you do loop on !owner, previuosly you insisted we'd go to
sleep on !owner. Yes, with !owner spinning that is indeed not needed.

Hmm, still wouldn't the spin_on_owner() loopyness and the above need
that need_resched() check you mentioned to that it can fall into the
slow path and go to sleep?
