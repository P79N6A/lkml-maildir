well I already looked at framebuffers and choose to not use them because
t6963c controller does not have a frame buffer memory that can be accessed
by using mmap. It must be accessed through data write commands. So I decided
to not use them in order to save code space and speed up things.
am I wrong in my choice ?

Does frame buffer have such mechanism ? if so could you point me the code that
handles it ?
