either it's an improvement in the GPLv3 or it's a violation of GPLv2.
you can't say that the GPLv2 prohibits it _and_ it's an improvement in the 
GPLv3.
unless you are saying that the GPLv3 is saying that a third party link now 
_is_ sufficiant. this seems to be counter to what the FSF is claiming 
(with good reasoning. after all, you don't control the third party site, 
so it could change or go away and now the people who got the binaries from 
you can't get the sources)
