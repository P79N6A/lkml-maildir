I was able to upgrade the firmware to build 6089 and everything works
flawlessly now. I'm currently using your aacraid-1.1.5-2345 driver and things
haven't complained once. I also haven't had a problem with Alan's aacraid
driver on my development server, which is running Perc 3/Si fw 2951.
So Perc 2/Si fw 2939 must be buggy, all there is to it. :)
Anyways, thanks for your quick help! I'll let you know if anything else goes
wrong.
