At the risk of putting you on the spot, do you mind saying whether the
grouping pages by mobility and ZONE_MOVABLE patches are going in the
direction you want or should something totally different be done? If
they are going the right direction, is there anything critical that is
missing right now?

There may be additional work required to make this play nicely with
ZONE_MOVABLE but it shouldn't be anything fundamental.

Same as above really. If the node contains one zone - ZONE_MOVABLE, it
would work for unplugging.
