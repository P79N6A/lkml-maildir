Well, they are similar, aren't they ? get_cpu_ptr() can just be thought
of as the dynamic twin of get_cpu_var(). So, in that sense it seems ok
to me.

The interlaced allocator allows you to save space when kmalloc_percpu()
is used to allocate small objects. That is done by interlacing each
CPU's copy of the objects just like the static per-cpu data area.
