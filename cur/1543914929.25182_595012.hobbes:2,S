You're right. I don't know why I thought vdso was older...

Does that mean we'll need to keep 3 different implementations of gtod
in the kernel forever ?

I think signal trampolines will still need them too. So making
vsyscalls configurable doesn't seem to work, does it ?
I took a look to glibc-2.4 and it doesn't seem to use
__kernel_vsyscall vsyscall. Am I wrong ? If so could you point me
where it's used in the code ?
Another not so related question, hope you don't mind :)
I'm having hard time to understand how ld.so is working, specially the
dynamic symbol resolution after looking at the glibc code and reading
the ELF specification.
Do you know any others documents that could help ?
Thanks a lot.
