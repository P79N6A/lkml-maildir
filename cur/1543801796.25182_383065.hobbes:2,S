Your oops does not make much sense, could you enable following, please:
CONFIG_DEBUG_KERNEL=y
CONFIG_DEBUG_SLAB=y
CONFIG_MAGIC_SYSRQ=y
CONFIG_FRAME_POINTER=y

Could you boot with pci=noacpi and report again? The difference is that 
ACPI will still be used but not for IRQ routing. I have a few boxes out 
with 2.4.x kernels and Adaptec HBAs that need this to work reliably.

What's the SCSI BIOS version?

What's the diff between /proc/interrupt and lspci -v on those kernels, 
when they've finished the booting sequence?
If you find time, send me your BIOS settings and your .config in private 
email. I didn't track this thread from the beginning, so I don't know if 
you've already done this.
It might also help to carry this problem over to the linux-scsi mailing 
list, since, I believe, most SCSI guys don't ready lkml too frequently.
Of course, if 2.6.x works for you and you need to go productive, then 
I'd switch to it if I was you.
Just my 2 cents,
Roberto Nibali, ratz
