Hmmm, i've looked back a couple of releases and this seems to get
reported correctly.  Removing this space is then silent.
ERROR: no space after that '*' (ctx:BxW)
#4: FILE: Z31.c:1:
+       crc = __be32_to_cpu(* ((__be32 *) ((void *) firmware + calc_size)));
What version is checkpatch reported as?  Also can I have the entire diff
hunk this is from in case its being caused by the context, though that
seems unlikely.
