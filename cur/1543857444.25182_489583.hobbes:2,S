The performance of the PRNG without constantly adding entropy is up tp
factor 40 faster than /dev/urandom ;- , depending on the block size of
the read.
With the current patch it performs not so well because of the STCKE loop
before every KMC. I think about removing them and changing the
periodically seed to use get_random_bytes instead.
