IMHO it would be more consequent and clean to introduce an separate 
type for this and only use specific macros for manipulation. Of course
this introduced some typing overhead, but enforces the coder to think
more carefully about his code. For critical things like kernel stuff,
I really prefer this way.
BTW: I just wondered a bit how the 9p driver finds out the numeric
user ID's for 9P user names.
