Subject: [PATCH 53/61] NFS: nfs_lookup - dont hash dentry when optimising away the lookup
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us know.
------------------
From: Trond Myklebust <Trond.Myklebust@netapp.com>
If the open intents tell us that a given lookup is going to result in a,
exclusive create, we currently optimize away the lookup call itself. The
reason is that the lookup would not be atomic with the create RPC call, so
why do it in the first place?
A problem occurs, however, if the VFS aborts the exclusive create operation
after the lookup, but before the call to create the file/directory: in this
case we will end up with a hashed negative dentry in the dcache that has
never been looked up.
Fix this by only actually hashing the dentry once the create operation has
been successfully completed.
