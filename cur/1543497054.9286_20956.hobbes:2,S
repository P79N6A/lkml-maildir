i386 kernel, boot assembly code rewrite
- -- --- -- ----- - --- -- --- ----- --

I was pretty bored one lonely day, and decided to brush up on my assembly
knowledge by taking all of the Intel syntax i386 assembly, and rewriting
it in AT&T (gas friendly) syntax.
Pointless? Naw! Here are few good things that came out of it:
	o The kernel is no longer dependent on as86/ld86.  Wonderful!
	
	o Personally, I find AT&T style much more readable, not to
	  mention that this is the *only* part of the kernel still using
	  as86/ld86.
	o build.c is a bit smaller since it doesn't have to mess
	  with minix style (aka ld86) output.
	
	o It's a patch that *removes* (and cleans up) old code!
	  Everybody loves those.
Files touched:
	arch/i386/boot/bootsect.S
	arch/i386/boot/setup.S
	arch/i386/boot/video.S
	arch/i386/boot/Makefile
	arch/i386/boot/tools/build.c
	arch/i386/boot/compressed/Makefile	(removed unneeded -m elf_i386)
	(up to date as of kernel v2.3.2) (2.3.3 should work)
To-do:
	1) Ask maintainers if it was alright for me to slash through their
	code like this. :)
[ Note: Not for lack of trying.. I just can't seem to get in touch with
Martin Mares, who appears to be the current maintainer; ideas? ]
Testers, comments and blurgs would be much appreciated.
