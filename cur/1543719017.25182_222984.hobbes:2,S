Subject: 2.6.6 and hard drive power-off on reboot?

I have been using linux-2.6.6 for almost 2 weeks now, but I have rebooted only once till today...
As I was playing with some options and had to reboot quite a few times today, I noticed that on each reboot (Ctrl+Alt+Del), all hard drives are powerd down (a loud noise of the heads being parked and drive spinned down can be heard).
When the machine boots again, there is a considerable delay (1-2s) when each hard drive is reinitialized/spinned-up.
This was not the case in 2.6.5.
Is there any way to change this in 2.6.6?
Did I turn on/off something by chance in the .config?
I just did:
gzcat /proc/config.gz |diff -u -- /usr/src/linux-2.6.5/.config -
but I cannot see anything suspicious, although there are quite a few changes, mainly inm order to have more modules.
No ideas how to "debug" such situations...
Kalin.
