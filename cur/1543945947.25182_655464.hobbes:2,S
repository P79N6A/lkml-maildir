Thanks for tracking this down and sorry for breaking the dreamcast pci driver.
Most code for the dreamcast currently do direct register access using
ctrl_inN/outN or readN/writeN. Only a few places use inN/outN and
depend on the value of generic_io_base. Doing inN/outN is ok (but
outdated, use ioreadN/iowriteN instead) in a portable pci/isa driver,
but it doesn't make sense for any dreamcast specific code to rely on
generic_io_base. For the dreamcast we already know the address at
compile time so doing adjustment during runtime is just unnecessary
overhead.
It is of course possible to revert the dreamcast-specific bits of the
commit you pointed out, but I think the change for the dreamcast makes
sense since it makes the code both faster and more uniform.
However, at this point it is broken. Sorry about that. I just looked
through all upstream dreamcast-specific code I could find and irq.c is
now the only file that does inN/outN. I've attached a patch that makes
the irq code independent of generic_io_base. There is also another
patch attached that adjusts the addresses of the pci register.
Together they should solve the problem you are seeing. Please try them
on top of 2.6.25-rc2.
With these patches io ports count from 0 -> 8k-1 instead of being a
pointer. We currently rely on generic_io_base logic but that will be
changed in the future.
Please let me know the results. Thank you.
