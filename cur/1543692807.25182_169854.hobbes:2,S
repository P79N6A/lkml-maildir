*Ouch*
Thanks for spotting.  IMO there's an easier fix, though - I see what you
do with ERR_PTR() and it's a clever way to pass information, but it would
be much more straightforward to have the following:
r_start() - as now
static void *r_next(struct seq_file *m, void *v, loff_t *pos)
{
	++*pos;
	if (v)
		deactivate_super(v);
	return NULL;
}
static void r_stop(struct seq_file *m, void *v)
{
	if (v)
		deactivate_super(v);
}
r_show() - as now.
We don't need to crawl in de->... guts past that point in ->start() - after
all, past that point we'll have a pointer to our superblock passed as argument.
