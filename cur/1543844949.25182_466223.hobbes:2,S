Subject: [PATCH] Revert ABI-breaking change in /proc
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/9/24/244

Some user tools parse /proc/scsi/scsi, so we can't yet change the names.
Change the existing ones back to their old names, and add an admonition
to not make the same mistake that I did.
Andrew Morton reports that this was breaking YDL 4.1 userspace.
