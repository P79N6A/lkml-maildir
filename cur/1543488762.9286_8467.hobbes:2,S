Yes - if you don't process the other fields you will deadlock

If you allow one frame of extra data to be queued, thats out by 64K, because
I can send 64K frames. In fact this is the classic "kill SunOS 4" attack
- SYN bombing with a syn attached to 64K of data.

Ok then you have more than one deadlock. TCP performs best with 3 or more frames
in the window size. So you reduce the MSS to windowsize/3 if need be.

No
