Agreed, however we have m68k boxes that have an ISA bus and another
bus, where the native bus behaves pretty much like PCI in a PC and the
ISA bus requiring special treatment on those machines, with weird byte
order issues, special areas to read from than write from etc. I
therefore prefer to keep the native busses from using the inb/outb and
readb/writeb macros and reserve those macros to to do the magic for
ISA and PCI.
The Macintosh case is not problematic since I don't think there are
m68k based with anything but NUBUS.
