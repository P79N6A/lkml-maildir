Care to back that up with numbers ? Take another look at the statistics
Larry posted after the 2.5.8 merge. ISTR pretty much a 50/50 split of
bk merges and regular GNU patches.  Whilst a large proportion of the gnu
patches were from the largish sync I did, this ratio seems to be holding
up over every release.

Film at 11: proprietory tool used in Linux.
Maybe we should back out all those fixes the Stanford people found with
their checker ? Maybe we should back out the x86-64 port seeing as it
was (partly) done with a commercial simulator?

You've not pointed out where this difficulty is yet. Apart from
developers having to wade through this same discussion every third week.
