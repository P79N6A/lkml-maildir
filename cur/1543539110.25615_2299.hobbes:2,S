Hello,
I am using redhat linux 6.2 on a pc with kernel 2.2.14.
Need to apply ide patch in people/hedrick directory
on kernel.org's ftp site for drivers.
Unfortunately I can't get it to install properly - obviously
i not applying patch properly
I am trying following
patch -s -p1 < ide.2.2.14.20000124.patch
it seems to update makefile - so I can select option in
menuconfig but it is not adding drivers to ~drivers/block
directory for compiling which subsequently fails.
I am using kernel 2.3.10 at the moment for drivers but this
kernel is known for filesystem problems apparently.
Help appreciatted
Kevin.
