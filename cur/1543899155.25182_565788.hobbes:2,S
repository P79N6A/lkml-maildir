Regarding the Subject:  Perhaps it's not of type "dead (K)config
variable"in the strict sense but rather of the type "local macro whose
name was unbefittingly taken from CONFIG_ namespace".
BTW, when I suggested the "#if 0" to you, I forgot that some developers
might be interested in compiling their kernel with
-DCONFIG_BALANCED_IRQ_DEBUG injected via the commandline. But we'll hear
from them if that's the case.
On the other hand, these debug macros seem to be very old.  I'll have a
closer look with qgit/git-blame later today.  Maybe it's time to remove
them now.
