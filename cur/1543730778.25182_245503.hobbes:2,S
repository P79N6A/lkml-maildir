Utilities that works on files only, such as cat, should keep
working.  No problem there.  If you cat a file that also is
a directory, then the file contents is all you get - by design.
Utilities that _only_ traverse the directory tree, such as find,
should keep working too.  Perhaps with a very minor update
so they don't mistake a file-directory for a file only.  I.e.
find must recurse into anything that support directory semantics.
Something that both recurse and operate on files (cp -a, tar, grep, ...
will need minor updating.  They already knows how to handle
files and directories, now they will need an update so
they're open for objects that are both.  I.e. let grep scan the file
as usual, then recurse into its directory part in the usual way too.
Performance problems should be avoided by not supporting
directory operations on files with no directory content, which I
believe will be many of them.
The "file-as-directory" thing will not be that useful before the tools
gets these relatively simple updates.  Till then it'll be a toy, which 
shouldn't
stop it from getting into the VFS.  Updating the tools will be a task
for the file-as-dir fans.
(I don't know wether reiser4 does things this way - it is certainly
they way I would want file-as-directory though.)

Stick the file in an attachment and you get the file only. 
No problem, it is designed that way.  An app that really
wants everything in a single file should use a file structured
for that, not file-as-dir.  File-as-dir attach stuff to a file in a
more loose way.
If you want to attach the directory contents too, do what you usually do
when you want to mail someone a directory tree.  You can't stick a 
directory
in an attachment because it is not a file.  So you either attach every 
file in
the tree, or use tar.  In this case, an updated tar.
The ftp server shouldn't be a problem.  It supports both files and
directories already.  It may need a minor update in order to
not mistake directory for file or vice-versa when someone
request an operation.

Sure.  And a file with a directory support both directory and file 
operations.
You can get the stream of bytes as usual - that's the file part.  Or you
can cd into the directory as usual. There isn't much overlap between
file operations and directory operations, so there is little conflict 
the way
I see it.  Merely letting the tools know that being a file no longer rule
out the possibilities of directory operations.  Getting the VFS right
is another matter of course, but I don't worry about userland tools.
