Hi,
I have one question regarding Crash Dump.
Is Kernel-2.6.20 having the default Crash dump in main
tree?
As I know, LKCD is one of the Crash dump utility 
software which can be used with Linux Kernel (it is a
third party s/w).
can any one please tell me the right thing about Crash
dump?
Thanks
RAM
