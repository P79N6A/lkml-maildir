What does this error mean?  I'm attempting to plug in a USB keyboard I've got
and it gives me the messages
  hub 1-0:0: new USB device on port 1, assigned address 3
  input: USB HID v1.10 Keyboard [CHESEN USB Keyboard] on usb-0000:00:11.2-1
  drivers/usb/input/hid-core.c: ctrl urb status -75 received
Other USB keyboards work fine so it must be something special with this one.
This is under all kernels from 2.5.60 to 2.6.0-test1
