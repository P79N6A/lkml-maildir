What about Pause and Asym_Pause? Dunno why so few, if any, eth drivers
impl. it, but the PHY lib supports it.
Even if fixed PHYs doesn't support it directly I think the OF interface
should have it.
    - fixed-link : <a b c d e> where a is emulated phy id - choose any,
      but unique to the all specified fixed-links, b is duplex - 0 half,
      1 full, c is link speed - d#10/d#100/d#1000, d is pause - 0 no pause,
      1 pause, d asym_pause - 0 no asym_pause, 1 asym_pause.
