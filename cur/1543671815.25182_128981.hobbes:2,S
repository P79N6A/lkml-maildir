Subject: [PATCH] Fix NULL handler for compat_ioctl
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Pretty serious ommision, but I'm guessing there's not too many users of
the {un,}register_ioctl32_conversion calls. Linux1394 just happens to
use it quite extensively, so this showed up on my radar by coincidence.
You are supposed to be able to pass a NULL handler to
register_ioctl32_conversion to signify a compatible translation, IOW,
use the 64-bit ioctl handler. Without this patch, we would instead jump
to a NULL address.
Applies to current 2.5.68-bk (see Larry, someone is using bk-cvs for
something good :).
