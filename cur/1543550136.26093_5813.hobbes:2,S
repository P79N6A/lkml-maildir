Yes, he is still with the Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam. Have a look at
his homepage at  
http://www.cs.vu.nl/~ast/
 .
I met him a couple of years ago at a symposium about the Distributed ASCI
Supercomputer (DAS, see 
http://www.asci.tudelft.nl/das/das.shtml
 ). At
that time, the DAS ran BSDI, but later on they switched to Linux. I guess
that he isn't that negative about Linux anymore.
