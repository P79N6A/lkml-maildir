Hi all,
Sorry if this post to the list is inapropriate, i havnt been on the
kernel mailing list for long.
I am having rather ugly problems with this card using the PDC20269 chip.
Almost as soon as either of the HDDs on the controller are used, the
kernel hangs solid with a dump of debugging info.
Ive tried moving cards, diff, ram, cpu, etc everything short of changing
MB (never been a problem before installing this card), so im sure that
its this new IDE controller card that is the problem.
I have also tried changing interrupts via the BIOS to remove possible
clashes, but it also has not helped.
I am getting this problem with both the 2.4.22 and the 2.6.0-test7
kernels (tried different minimal configs).
Can anyone help me with this problem?
If any other info is needed, please let me know.
Thanks,
 Mark Williams.
