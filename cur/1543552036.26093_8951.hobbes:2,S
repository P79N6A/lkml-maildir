Have you thought about an SOL_SOCKET level socket option?  It might be
more intuitive for programmers than an ioctl and could be documented
with sockets where it will be used.  Again, we would run into
compatibility issues with other Sockets implementations, but
traditionally the sockopt funtionality between implementations are
(sorta) expected to vary.   Just an idea.
