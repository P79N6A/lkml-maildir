Because it doesn't happen on my Gentoo or Red Hat based systems? :)

As you point out, this is all in how udev is handled by the boot
scripts, if they wait long enough for the device node to show up before
continuing on or not.  Thereby showing that this is a distro specific
issue.
Now the Debian maintainer of udev has said that you should also read the
README file for udev for more information about this type of issue.  I
suggest you go through the Debian bug reporting process for further
help.
Good luck,
