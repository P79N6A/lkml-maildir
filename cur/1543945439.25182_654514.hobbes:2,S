I wonder why I didn't see any of this - I build arm allmodconfig at least
once a week, usually more frequently.
So either the offending patches weren't in my pile or arm allmodconfig is
worse than I thought :(
It really is in arch maintainers' best interest to keep their allmodconfig
in good shape, for this reason.  arm's _isn't_ in good shape: the compile
fails for several long-standing reasons (eg: no hope of building DRM) and I
don't think the coverage is very broad either.
