  I see you point. Flexability is good.
  A non numa Summit box is just regular SMP.  The Summit hw platform
is a multi node hardware layout and single nodes are valid and common.
 All Summit HW (numa and non) can boot regular smp kernels (numa boxes
pay the performance hit).  The Summit sub-arch is needed to setup i386
NUMA for the box in multi-node situations not to perform basic bootup.
  Booting Summit without NUMA is sort of missing the point...
Thanks
