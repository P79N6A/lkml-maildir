I can do this if you think that this is a good idea. Acutally I see
usbmon as an option of the USB core. This will also reduce the code a
little bit, because you don't need an registration interface. You can
call the usbmon functions directly.

I think that separation is a good idea, but dividing such a minimum code
into four files didn't make it cleaner. Two much separation makes it
even worse and sometimes harder to understand. I personally vote for
having a single driver/usb/core/usbmon.c and link it into usbcore if
selected.

This would be great and btw the official mount point for debugfs should
be /sys/kernel/debug as Greg posted some time ago.

I think if cat is the prefered tool for viewing this file then it should
be more human readable. If not, then a binary format should be choosen.
Maybe we can implement both. Is this possible?

I don't, because I need to check the encoding in the kernel source to do
that. I also think that we should abstract from the definition of pipe.

I can start with usbdump if we agree on an interface. I personally would
prefer a binary interface for that.
