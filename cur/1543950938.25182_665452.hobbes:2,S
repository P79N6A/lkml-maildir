Sounds like a DMA screwup. However, I'm pretty sure that it's not a
generic ALSA problem with ISA DMA, as my good old GUS MAX still works
perfectly on lx164 (machine that is very similar to your miata) as
I checked yesterday with patched 2.6.25-rc4. :-)

I wonder if it still works on x86 - perhaps you ought to ask ALSA folks.
I'll search my machine room next week - I recall that there were a dozen
of old ISA soundcards, maybe there is some es18xx stuff, but chances
are slim...
