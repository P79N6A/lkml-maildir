Subject: RT exec for exercising RT kernel capabilities

With the ongoing work being done to rt kernel enhancements by Ingo and friends,
I would like to offer the use of a user land test (rt-exec). The rt-exec tests
well the deterministic real-time capabilities of a computer. Maybe it could
useful in some way to the effort or to anyone interested in making this type of
determination about their kernel/computer.
A README describing the rt-exec can be found at
ftp://ftp.compro.net/public/rt-exec/README
It can be downloaded from
ftp://ftp.compro.net/public/rt-exec/rt-exec-1.0.0.tar.bz2
Complaints, comments, or suggestions welcome.
Regards
Mark Hounschell
