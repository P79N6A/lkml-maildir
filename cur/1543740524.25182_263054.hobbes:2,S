If you can drop it into the 2.6-ac patches that would be great and
I will merge it from review of the current code. That should have
correct IDE locking and also possibly correct PCI IDE locking (actually
I need to fix one detail).
Having a cardbus IDE adapter would be a godsend for my testing so I'll
see if I can find a source of them over here too for brutalising the
code.
The only visible difference is that we pass a hwif to the unregister
functions in the -ac tree.
