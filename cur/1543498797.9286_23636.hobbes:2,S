OK, this would indicate that there is a problem.  However, we use a scheme
that fundamentally should keep the registers consistent as the user space
level just like the MMX routines in the raid5 xor code of Ingo's.  Evidently
though, that scheme fails under certain conditions, so I'll have to revisit it
and see what I can do (personally, my machine never gets into swap and as well
I don't have any userlevel XMM register using code so I didn't see this
behaviour, but that's why I released a test patch...)
