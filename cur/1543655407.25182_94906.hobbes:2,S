Subject: [PATCH]  Make sure the size of a wait-queue hashtable isn't 1
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

The hash_long function in <linux/hash.h> returns bogus results for size
1 hashtables, and wait-queue hashtables can reach that limit for
small-memory systems, so this patch makes the minimum size 4.
This fix was suggested by Andrew Morton.
