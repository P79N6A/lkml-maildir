Good report - thanks.
Christoph - fallback_alloc() can be called with interrupts off.
I fixed the cpuset_zone_allowed() call from fallback_alloc() to avoid
sleeping.  Notice the __GFP_HARDWALL added in Linus's version, or the
new function cpuset_zone_allowed_hardwall() in Andrew's version, all
done in the last week.
But apparently kmem_getpages() can also sleep, as it calls __alloc_pages().
