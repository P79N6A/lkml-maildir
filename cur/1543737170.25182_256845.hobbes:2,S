One thing in common with the hang I've reported on this list seems to be the network traffic bit.  My app does quite a bit of
traffic and uses thread mutex primitives, the SCHED_RR scheduler, and select() extensively.

i had that problem on my T41p (kernel oops when unlocking xlock, usually
if constant network traffic went on in the back).
updating madwifi to CVS version helped. (i had the version that comes
