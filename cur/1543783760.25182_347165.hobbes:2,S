I meant that there could be situations, which have not yet been found,
where it could be preferred to use 8K stacks instead of 4K. When you
switch from having 8K stacks as default to 4K stacks without
possibility for 8K stacks you'd possibly encounter these yet to be
found situations.
When on the other hand the 4K stacks are set as default, leaving the
option in, instead of removing it, these possible situations, when
found, could be resolved (temporarilly) by switching back to 8K
stacks.
After a while having 4K stacks as default would be a better time to
decide whether to remove the option or not instead of now.
