Sorry, but this code returns wrong results. Test it with less
iterations, it doesn't return the same result.

You never even compare with table[0] !

I recoded a table based on your idea, and it's clearly faster than others, and
even faster than yours :
============
static unsigned tbl[33] = { 2147483648, 1073741824, 536870912, 268435456,
			    134217728, 67108864, 33554432, 16777216,
			    8388608, 4194304, 2097152, 1048576,
			    524288, 262144, 131072, 65536,
			    32768, 16384, 8192, 4096,
			    2048, 1024, 512, 256,
			    128, 64, 32, 16,
			    8, 4, 2, 1, 0 };
static inline int fls_tbl_fls(unsigned n)
{
        unsigned i = 0;
	while (n < tbl[i])
	    i++;
        return 32 - i;
}
===========
it returns the right result. Compiled with gcc 2.95.3 -march=i686 -O3, athlon
