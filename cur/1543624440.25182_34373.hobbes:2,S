Well, as I said a few postings ago, I'm not really proof with
ACPI.
But ... from a users point of view (which I seem to be proof for -
especially in *this* case :)):
I enable in the BIOS, what devices should be considered wake
up devices.
This works very well with Windows (not that I'm going to use that,
I just tested it to validate, if it works there), it did work
very well with 2.4.13 too (yes, I know, there was the TODO: disable
GPEs).
Where is the problem to read those wake up events from the BIOS?
Why should I configure this twice - once in BIOS, once in some
ominous ospmd?
I grepped the ACPI code...
If I understand it right, a call to acpi_hw_enable_gpe_for_wakeup(event)
would mark one specific event as wakeup event.
The only call to this function is in acpi_enable_event(...).
And the only call to acpi_enable_event() is in
acpi_install_fixed_event_handler(...) and is flagged as
ACPI_EVENT_FIXED, so that acpi_hw_enable_gpe_for_wakeup() is
*never* called in the whole ACPI code at the moment, so how
can there be GPEs marked as wakeup events however?
And if there can't be any, why should I'm not be able to work
around this bug?
And yes - I consider this as bug :) There is code, which is never
called, afaics.
regards,
   Mario, trying to understand :)
