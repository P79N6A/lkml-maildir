My first guess would be power.  You said you tested the power source.
Can you get ahold of a power line monitor with a strip chart recorder?
You might have a situation where the power is normally fine but for some
reason it could fluctuate at times and kick a machine into reset.
I assume you've eliminated the possibility of the janitor who unplugs
a machine to find an outlet for his floor polisher (don't laugh, it's
happened).
How's the temperature on the machines?  Even if it's OK it would be
good to get another strip chart recorder on it to make sure the temp
stays within bounds 24hrs/day.
Also, do you have a serial console attached to each machine?  This is
the only reliable way to make sure you have every console message that
came out right before the reboot.
