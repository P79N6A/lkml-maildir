because in 2.6 user-level programs do not speak with low-level hardware
drivers anymore. psmouse feeds events to input midlayer that dispatches
them to those handlers that expressed interest. And those handlers speak
with user-level tools.
/dev/psaux is an *emulated* ImPS mouse that is not related to any
real hardware. It will convert events from _any_ mouse you have into
PS/2 protocol for users but if there is no mouse it just sits there
and waits.
/dev/psaux is provided by mousemod not psmouse.
In general there seems to be no way to load low-level input drivers
on access because there is no instance that ever accesses them. And
as it stands now there is not way to auto-load using some other means.
So we are back in static configuration times ...

only for misc devices. It is char-major-X for most others

no.

what exactly do you mean?

from device file on open.
