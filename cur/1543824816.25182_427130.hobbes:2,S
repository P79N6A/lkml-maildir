Sure, X has no problem doing an expose event on the entire screen.
But then the kernel would need a way to tell X that the display
was invalidated outside its control.  Is there even an
API for that today?
The problem isn't trivial, for the machine may be running
quite a few xservers.  Or some other sort of software
that uses the framebuffer.  (libsvga, y, berlin, ...)
