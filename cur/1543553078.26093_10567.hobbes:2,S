Keith, this sounds like a K-ludge.
Take the instance where we need to link a.o first, z.o second, f.o third
and p.o fourth.  How does LINK_FIRST / LINK_LAST guarantee this?
LINK_FIRST = a.o z.o
LINK_LAST = f.o p.o
But then what guarantees that 'a.o' will be linked before 'z.o'?
A first/last implementation can *not* specify precisely a link order without
guaranteeing that the order of the LINK_FIRST *and* the LINK_LAST objects
is preserved, which incidentally is the same requirement for the obj-y
implementation.
I don't see what this LINK_FIRST / LINK_LAST gains us other than more
complexity for zero gain.
