Subject: [patch] better dynamic buffer-hash-table
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/1999/4/30/82

I seen that in 2.2.7 the number of the free areas list is been elarged
from 6 to 10. Maybe the only reason to do that is not been the
dynamic-buffer hash code inserted in 2.2.7.
Anyway I wrote a (I think better) dynamic hash-table code that also don't
play with GFP at all.
My patch below will apply correctly against 2.2.7:
