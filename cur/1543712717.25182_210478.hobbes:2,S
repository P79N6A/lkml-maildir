By not modifying a single line in the existing VM path, your patch
simply duplicates functionality from that existing code, which I'm not
sure is any better.  
I think there's a lot of commonality with what the swap code, NUMA page
migration, and memory removal have to do.  However, none of them share
any code today.  I think all of the implementations could benefit from
making them a bit more generic.
