Hello;
  I don't know if this is a bug or a feature.  While I was
playing around with 2.4.0 I (mistakenly) mounted an ext2
partition twice.  
The excerpt from mount looks like this.
/dev/hda1 on /a1 type ext2 (rw)
/dev/hda1 on /mnt type ext2 (rw)
Under 2.2.13 I get 
mount: /dev/hda1 already mounted or /mnt busy
mount: according to mtab, /dev/hda1 is mounted on /a1
Is this a bug or a feature? 
System is an ABIT VP6, dual PIII 733Mhz, 1gb RAM, 
30g ATA 100 drive, IBM Deskstar.  DMA is on.
