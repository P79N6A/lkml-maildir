Several reasons.  The big one in my mind is, it will be delivering 
pieces without which the kernel will not boot, so you really really want 
to keep that software in sync with the latest kernel...  at least until 
all the details are worked out.  Otherwise version skew will as we 
remove code from the kernel and move it to userspace will be painful -- 
users would be rebuilding their external klibc trees just about every 
day, as code was moved from kernel to early-userspace.
