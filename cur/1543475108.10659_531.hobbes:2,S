Hi!
I am observing file corruption of strange sort with an NFS tree
mounted from a Solaris file server.
This corrupted file is produced when linking a program with gcc.  Of
course this result will dump core when executed... If the same program
is linked on the local hdd, then the corruption does not occur. It
also does not occur with linux-2.0.36. I think this bug was already
present in 2.1.131, but I don't know when it was introduced. 
An example of how the corrupted file differs from the 'proper' output
in the following:
Starting at offsets divisable by 4096, ...  and extending for a random
number of bytes, the data in the file is moved a few bytes forward.
So for example the data 
...xyzabcdefghijklmnop...
   ^ start of 4096 byte block
 becomes
...xyzXXXabcdefghijnop...
   ^            ^ some bytes are removed
   inserted a few random bytes
