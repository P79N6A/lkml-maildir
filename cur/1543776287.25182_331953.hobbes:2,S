 Yup. Do not forget that FW is very powerful. Likely the parking
feature was added after A6BA.
 Basically I saw that the only difference between me and Pekka was the
FW (discounting the different CPU speed and Kernel version). I googled
around and found the IBM FW page at:
http://www-306.ibm.com/pc/support/site.wss/document.do?sitestyle=ibm&lndocid=MIGR-41008
 Download is simple, just don't use the "IBM Download Manager". Main
problem is that one needs a bootable floopy drive and "the other OS" to
create a bootable floppy. It would be great if IBM could provide floppy
images for use with "dd" for the poor Linux users.
 Then I pondered over the risk involved with the update. Curiosity won
:-) And now the head parks. BUT - I definitely do not encourage anybody
to perform the procedure. Do at your own risk after thinking about the
possible consequences ...
 Anyway someone reported a non working  HTS548040M9AT00 with FW
revision MG2OA53A. The newest revision, from the same floppy image, is
A5HA.
Cheers
Martin
