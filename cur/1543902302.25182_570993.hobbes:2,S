Subject: [PATCH -mm 1/5] Freezer: Document relationship with memory shrinking
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

From: Rafael J. Wysocki <rjw@sisk.pl>
One important reason to freeze tasks, which is that we don't want them to
allocate memory after freeing it for the hibernation image, has not been
documented.  Fix it.
