No.  It just isn't safe to do that.  If the BIOS has done something to the
controller then it may very well have reset the attached devices too.  Or
changed their addresses, or done something else equally drastic.

It is set in drivers/usb/host/uhci-hcd.c:start_rh().

The UHCI specification is rather sparse in many respects, and it doesn't 
say what the host firmware should or should not do during a resume.  So 
the driver has to be very conservative and assume that any indication of a 
change means that the entire controller must be reset.

Long ago I posted a patch that would take care of all this.  Not just for
UHCI, but for any USB controller.  Maybe I should dig it out, update it,
and submit it.

EHCI controllers tend to be better behaved than UHCI controllers, perhaps
because the specification is much more careful to explain what must be
done.  In many cases a computer can resume from suspend-to-RAM with all 
the EHCI-connected devices still intact.
