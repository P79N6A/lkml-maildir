No I agree, it's always nice to handle these cases in software so we
don't have to rely on these things getting fixed.

Here's something ridicolously simple, that just wont start a new tag if
the oldest tag is older than 100ms. Clearly nothing for submission, but
it gets the point across.
Now only look at reads, and we've got something a little useful at
least.
James, speaking of queue localities and tcq... Doug mentioned some time
ago that aic7xxx dishes out tags numbers from a hba pool which makes it
impossible to support with out current block layer queueing code. Maybe
it we associate the blk_queue_tag structure with a bunch of queues
instead of having a 1:1 mapping it could work.
