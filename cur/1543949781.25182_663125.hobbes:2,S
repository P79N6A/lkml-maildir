the tsc thing seems to be an accidental proximity to me.
such a hard hang has a basic system setup feel to it: the PCI changes in 
2.6.25 or perhaps some ACPI changes. But it could also be timer related 
(although in that case it typically doesnt hang in the middle of a 
system setup sequence)
i'd say pci=nommconf, but your dmesg has this:
  PCI: Not using MMCONFIG.
but, what does seem to be new in your dmesg (i happen to have a historic 
dmesg-akpm2.txt of yours saved away) is:
  hpet0: at MMIO 0xfed00000, IRQs 2, 8, 11
  hpet0: 3 64-bit timers, 14318180 Hz
was hpet active on this box before? Try hpet=disable perhaps - does that 
change anything? (But ... this is still a 10% chance suggestion, there's 
way too many other possibilities for such bugs to occur.)
