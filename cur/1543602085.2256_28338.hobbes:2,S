Nope.  This change was rather important to simplifying
the page cache, so having slop is not really what we want.  Having
slop is actually a coherency nightmare.
You can do:  mmap(/dev/zero, size) read(binary) if you
really nead that functionality.  Unless you are running
many instances of a program it really shouldn't matter.
Also you can't emulate full x86 semantics whatever you do because you 
don't have 4K granularity.
There are actually processors where it is worse, and you need
something like 64K alignment despite the fact they have 4K pages.
That is needed to avoid conflicts in virtually indexed L1 caches.
