I fully agree with this. As Paul Mackerras mentioned elsewhere,
a lot of authors sprinkle atomic_t in code thinking they're somehow
done with *locking*. This is sad, and I wonder if it's time for a
Documentation/atomic-considered-dodgy.txt kind of document :-)

Such code was mentioned elsewhere (query nodemgr_host_thread in cscope)
that managed to escape the requirement for a barrier only because of
some completely un-obvious compilation-unit-scope thing. But I find such
an non-explicit barrier quite bad taste. Stefan, do consider plunking an
explicit call to barrier() there.
