Version 2.5.4 of perfctr, the Linux/x86 performance
monitoring counters driver, is now available at the usual
place: 
http://www.csd.uu.se/~mikpe/linux/perfctr/
Version 2.5.4, 2003-06-01
- Corrected the driver's handling of OVF_PMI+FORCE_OVF counters
  on Pentium 4. This configuration didn't work at all, and
  lead to various BUG messages from the driver.
  These restrictions apply to OVF_PMI+FORCE_OVF counters:
  * The ireset value must be -1.
  * Once the counter has interrupted once, it will continue
    to interrupt when the faulting instruction is restarted,
    causing it to never complete. This problem also occurs
    for non-FORCE_OVF interrupt-mode counters if the ireset
    value is of too small magnitude, like -1.
    This appears to be a P4 hardware quirk. Don't restart
    FORCE_OVF interrupt-mode counters, and don't use ireset
    values too small to allow instructions to complete.
- Updated library's K8 event descriptions to match current
  documentation. Corrected several omissions and errors.
- Patch kit updated for kernels 2.5.70 and 2.4.21-rc6.
