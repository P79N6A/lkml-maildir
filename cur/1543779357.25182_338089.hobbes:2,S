The problem is we are going to use ACPI interpreter with interrupt
disabled. The interpreter itself might use kmalloc, semaphore, iomap,
msleep and etc, depends on BIOS. Fixing interpreter is hard. Originally
we think to introduce a new system state for suspend/resume to avoid
warning, but later we found drivers calling pci_disable_irq/free_irq is
better and safer not just for the issue at hand. We might reconsider
previous option (a new system state) if free_irq is rejected.
