While that would be great.
With all due respect to Larry and the bk team, I think you'll
find determining 'needed changesets' in this case is a _hard_ problem.
How is bk supposed to find that a change depends on a previously
redefined api declared in a set of files othwerwise untouched by the 
changeset being exported.
Now , bk could make this a little easier by allowing changesets to
be exported without any dependencies (ala GNU-patch export - but
with metadata for commit messages).
The developer can then use a 'bk undo'  to remove the unnessary changeset
for his patch , reapply keeping the commit metadata, test and now
re-export a full bk patch with minimal dependencies.
Unfortuantely I know know way of currently instructing bk to
do this dependency-less export.
