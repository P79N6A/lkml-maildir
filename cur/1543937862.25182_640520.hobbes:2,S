I've now narrowed it down to the following change in 2.6.24-rc7-git5:

Reverting this eliminates the abovementioned BIOS hang.
I added a debug printk to sky2_init_netdev(), and it showed:
sky2_init_netdev: wol == 0x0, (sky2_wol_supported(hw) & WAKE_MAGIC) == 0x20
That is, 2.6.24-rc7-git4 and earlier drivers would set sky2->wol to 0,
while 2.6.24-rc7-git5 and newer will set it to 0x20. A quick look through
sky2.c shows that this will affect HW programming in several places.
Please revert or fix before 2.6.24 final.
