Well that should still work for noop, if it has its own internal
queueing list. But I would be quite fine with removing that implicit
next/prev support and simply require io scheds to supply these functions
always if they require rq-to-rq merging. Noop is the only one that
relied on this in the past, now seems a good time to clean that up as
well.
Besides, as you note, with merging disallowed on the ->queue_head, they
don't work as expected anymore.
