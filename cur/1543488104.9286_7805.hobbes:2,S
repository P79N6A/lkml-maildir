Hi,
I have 2.2.2 (vanilla) and am having problems with my SCSI chain.
I recently purchased a yamaha 4416 CDRW and am having trouble with the
chain under Linux (but not under Doze :( which is strange)
Basically - if I want to copy a CD image onto my hard drive, I am doing
dd if=/dev/sr1 of=disc.image
(The Yamaha is 0,3,0 (sr1) and my Old CD-ROM is 0,2,0 (sr0))
After an amount of time (usually approx 600mb down the line) I get
dd: /dev/sr1: Input/Output Error
+blah in
+blah out
And the SCSI bus resets itself entirely.
I am still conducting experiments (disconnecting bits of the bus) to see
if I can find out where the fault lies, and will post techie info later on.
Basically I am wondering if this sort of thing has been seen before and if
so - what I could do to fix it?
Is it fixed in the ac patch series? If so - where do I get it?
Many thanks
Daniel (Kinnison) Silverstone
