That's a separate issue.  A process can use mlock() or mlockall() to
prevent itself being swapped out, if it wants to.
In general, only part of a realtime process would want to be locked.
(The part that is actually touched by the real time code).
Anyway, my system wasn't swapping.  (Maybe it was doing lots of that
minor fault stuff though; I didn't check).
