The use of printk's and dprintk's in the rpc and nfsd code seems a
little arbitrary in places.  It would be worth grepping for them all,
figuring out how they're currently used, thinking about what we need
them for (to help administrators identify problems?  to help testers
provide debugging information to developers?), and how they might be
abused (remote hosts and unprivileged local users shouldn't be able to
spam the logs), developing some uniform policies, and submitting
patches.
I'm not volunteering, but if someone's interested I think it could be
really helpful, especially if it helps increase the usefulness of bug
reports.
