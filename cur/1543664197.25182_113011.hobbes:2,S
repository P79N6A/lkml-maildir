I'm having a VM issue on one of my servers running 2.4.20.
The box reports the following:
adam@foxy:~$ cat /proc/meminfo 
        total:    used:    free:  shared: buffers:  cached:
Mem:  4041986048 3968524288 73461760        0 619249664 1551077376

As you can see there is plenty of memory sitting in buffers/cache.  The
problem is that when our daily cronjobs run, the box starts swapping and the
load goes up to 30.  The cronjobs are just the normal system cronjobs like
updatedb, checksecurity, etc.
I had this problem a while ago with 2.4.6-xfs and 2.4.14-xfs, but this is 
stock 2.4.20 and I was under the impression that the VM was relatively OK by
now.
adam@foxy:~$ grep -i mem /boot/config-2.4.20
# CONFIG_NOHIGHMEM is not set
# CONFIG_HIGHMEM4G is not set
CONFIG_HIGHMEM64G=y
CONFIG_HIGHMEM=y
# Memory Technology Devices (MTD)
# CONFIG_BLK_DEV_UMEM is not set
# CONFIG_DEBUG_HIGHMEM is not set
Any suggestions?
Thanks,
