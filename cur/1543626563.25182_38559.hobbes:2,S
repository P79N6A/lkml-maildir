Rusty, here are a few comments !
In futex_wait  we have
	kmap(page)
	schedule_timeout()
	kunmap()
Are there potential for deadlocks, the mappings can be held for a long time 
and the KMAPs are limited.
Otherwise, kernel patch looks good. Will run it this weekend through 
ulockflex.
Other changes proposed for FUTEX 2.0
---------------------
A) in futex_down_timeout
	get ride of woken, don't see why you need that.
	optimize the while statement. Unless there are some hidden gcc issues.
static inline int futex_down_timeout(struct futex *futx, struct timespec *rel)
{
        int val, woken = 0;
        /* Returns new value */
        while ((val = __futex_down(&futx->count)) != 0) {
                switch (__futex_down_slow(futx, val, rel)) {
                case -1: 
		return -1; /* error */
                case 0: 
		futx->count = -1; /* slept */
		/* fall through */
                case 1:
                        return 0; /* passed */	
                }
        }
}
---------------------
Still missing something on the futex_trydown !!
 	futex_trydown   ::=  futex_down == 1 ? 0 : -1
So P1 holds the lock, P2 runs "while (1) { futex_trydown }" will decrement 
the counter yielding at some point "1" and thus granting the lock.
At one GHz on 32 way system this only requires a lock hold time of a few 
seconds. Doesn't sound like a good idea.
This brings back the discussion on compare and swap. This would be trivial to 
do with compare and swap.
Another solution would be to sync through the kernel at wraparound, so that
the count variable reflects the number of waiting processes.
That's for now....
