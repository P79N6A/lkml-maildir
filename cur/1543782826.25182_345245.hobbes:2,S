Well, there aren't many differences between 2.6.13-rc7 and 2.6.13.  If
I had to guess, I would bet the commit below is what broke you.  I'm
including a patch that reverts it at the end of this email
BTW, I have no knowledge of this area -- I'm just basing this on pure
changelog reading.  So if reverting this patch does fix your system, I
have no idea what the correct fix is.

    [PATCH] acpi_shutdown: Only prepare for power off on power_off
    When acpi_sleep_prepare was moved into a shutdown method we
    started calling it for all shutdowns.
    It appears this triggers some systems to power off on reboot.
    Avoid this by only calling acpi_sleep_prepare if we are going to power
    off the system.
