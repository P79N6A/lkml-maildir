xtime is easy, that's interpolated anyway afaics. Jiffies would either just
jump some, which code needs to deal with anyway given that preempt can do
the same, or would become an approximated thing as well based on the other
time keeping sources in the system.
calculating the load can be a real timer for sure (which would cause an irq
at that time), cpu limits we can do at the end of timeslice (and set the
timeslice such that the limits won't be exceeded).
