This device isn't accessed after *suspend.  By the time we reach
*resume, we know that the parent has had a *resume call first.  So if we
had a pci bus driver, we could enable the bridge device before this
network card reaches *resume.

I was referring to the pci bus power management issue, not the irq
handler.  I'm sorry I wasn't clear about this.

I think unregistering the handler is the equivalent and easier to get
right.  Otherwise, the driver developer needs to check a flag in the
interrupt handler to see if the device is sleeping, and if it is then
return IRQ_NONE.  Both options would work fine, but I don't see a race
condition with free_irq().

free_irq doesn't return until all pending irqs have completed, so we
don't need to do this if we're using the method I proposed.  In fact,
I think it calls synchronize_irq.
