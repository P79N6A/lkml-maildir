I am having a difficult time with the patch to run_bottom_halves.
I have the following:
        bh = bh_base;
        while ((active = get_active_bhs())) {
                __sti();
                clear_active_bhs(active);
                do {
                        if (active & 1)
                                (*bh)();
                        bh++;
                        active >>= 1;
                } while (active);
                __cli();
        }
I left the __sti(); / __cli(); in the caller.
On boot up I get an Oops and Aiee killing interrupt handler.
What did I screw up?
