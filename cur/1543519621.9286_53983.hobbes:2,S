I'd like to put my +1 in for 32-bit UIDs.
Now, about those 16 bit PID's... is it really fair to 
allow more users than threads or processes ?
(Just kidding.  At least for now.)
[dank@krunch linux-2.3.33]$ grep 'typedef.*pid_t' include/*/*.h | grep short
include/asm-arm/posix_types.h:    typedef unsigned short __kernel_ipc_pid_t;
include/asm-i386/posix_types.h:   typedef unsigned short __kernel_ipc_pid_t;
include/asm-m68k/posix_types.h:   typedef unsigned short __kernel_ipc_pid_t;
include/asm-ppc/posix_types.h:    typedef short          __kernel_ipc_pid_t;
include/asm-sh/posix_types.h:     typedef unsigned short __kernel_ipc_pid_t;
include/asm-sparc/posix_types.h:  typedef unsigned short __kernel_ipc_pid_t;
