Well for mmapped pages, man madvise. Specifically look at MADV_SEQUENTIAL
and MADV_DONTNEED.

To use other words, this is the typical case where a "hint" would be
useful.
program to kernel: "i read ONCE though this file caching not useful".
The last thing i knew in this area is that there exist a thing to tell
the kernel to drop all cache after the file is closed. (IIRC!)
But this doesn't help in this case as the image-file is up to 4,4GB in
whole which means that it ALONE can fill up the whole cache. Taking
aside the files the image was created from, which can (with a size of up
to 2GB (size-limit of iso9660-filesystem/linux-kernel)) also fill a lot
of cache until they are closed.
(The/My) typical case is this.
1 create image-file
2 remove source-files
3 burn image
4 remove image-file
Step 1 and 3 trash the cache without ANY positive effect.

wants a "you asked for it, you got it" text editor -- complicated, 
cryptic, powerful, unforgiving, dangerous.
