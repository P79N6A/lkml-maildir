Looks like USB and your sound card is on the same interrupt.  Is there
any BIOS settings you can make to move these around?

Long story, short answer: 2 different developers working on support for
the same device.  Both drivers work better for some people on different
devices.  JE is the author's initials (Johannes Erdfelt).
Personally for some devices I have I like one version, for others, I
like the other one.  Now if Johannes would ever fix the QUEUE_BULK bug,
I would be back to using only one driver :)
Let me know if moving the IRQs helps out.
