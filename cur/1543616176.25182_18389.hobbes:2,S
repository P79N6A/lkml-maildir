Subject: Why won't ext3 & 2.4.19 export the root?

I recently upgraded my kernel from 2.4.9 to 2.4.19 and at the same time
started using ext3.
Since that change, I can no longer export and/or mount the "/" of this
machine for backup purposes. This is a significant problem since remotely
mounting the file system is our primary (only) way of backing up several
of our production machines.
Exporting and mounting other than the root works normally.
Here is the /etc/exports for reference.
/            205.x.x.x(ro,no_root_squash)
/var/www     205.x.x.x(ro,no_root_squash)
I've googled and searched the mailing list archives but didn't find any
mention of this.
Can someone please tell me what I need to change in order to export the
root?
Thanks.
John Lange
