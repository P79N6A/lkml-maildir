Nice page, thank you.

These routines are often used and one of the goals was reducing code
size. That's why for generic case i used as few instructions as
possible,
while for optimized one i made some speedups with the cost of few
instructions more.
I don't see the point of string-486.c - string-486.h is a replacement
of string.h for i[45]86 machines so let stay in include directory.
best,
