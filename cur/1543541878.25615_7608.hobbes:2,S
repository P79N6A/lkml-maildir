Yep - at least, it LOOKS that way. In fact, it's a complete misnomer:
with that value set to 0, you get "normal" Linux behaviour. Otherwise,
processes receive demand-allocated memory: malloc() and friends will
ALWAYS "succeed", then the memory is really allocated once you write to
it.
There are a few "tricks" to ensure malloc() & co only ever return "real"
memory; the trouble is, this behaviour cripples Linux as a WWW server or
similar, as well as wasting a LOT of swap space for no apparent gain.
Resource limits are probably a better way to go to solve this sort of
problem. That, and the various process-killing add-ons mentioned last time
this topic cropped up.
James.
