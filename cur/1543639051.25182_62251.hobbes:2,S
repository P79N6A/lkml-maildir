   I've never been able to get a broadcom chipset ethernet card stable on a
   dual athlon with AMD 76x chipset. I have no idea what the problem is
   although it certainly appears to be PCI versus main memory ordering
   funnies.
One thing you can try is the following in tg3.c:
1) Force TG3_FLAG_PCIX_TARGET_HWBUG to be set in tp->tg3_flags
2) Change "tw32_mailbox(reg, val)" define to just be identical
   to "tw32(reg, val)"
