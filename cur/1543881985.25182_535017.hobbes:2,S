Hm, I hadn't thought about that. I'm not sure that /dev/k?mem is very
useful in an unprivileged guest, but I guess its useful for debugging or
stats or something. It's tricky to tell whether an arbitrary pfn is part
of a pagetable or not; there's a PG_PINNED page flag to tell you if its
active, but iff you've already determined its a pagetable page.

Well, the general idea is that in a paravirtualized environment
pagetable pages need special handling. Different hypervisors need
different handling, but they all need something special. The paravirt
hooks are intended to capture all the interesting events, without
over-constraining what special thing the hypervisor wants to do at that
point.
That's why I went for the "allow the hypervisor to provide a prototype
pagetable, and avoid the bits it has already set up"; it allows it to do
whatever it wants, without getting too specific about what that is, and
retains a fairly straightforward interface.

Hm, I think that's a hard function to write in general. For the special
case of pagetable_init it wouldn't be too hard, but it doesn't seem like
a big improvement over the current state of affairs.

(alloc_pd and alloc_pt)
Broadly speaking, they tell the hypevisor that there's a new page about
to be attached to the pagetable. Xen uses it as the hook to map those
pages RO if the pagetable is active. VMI (and lguest?) use it to tell
the hypervisor's shadow pagetable machinery that there's something new
to track.
