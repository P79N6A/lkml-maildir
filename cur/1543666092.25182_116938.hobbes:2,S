For the most part we are getting people who don't know about
CTL-ALT-BACKSPACE, and have never even seen a shell, and don't
know that the GUI is not the normal interface, complaining because
the machine "locks" after they play some lossy games. You don't
have to reboot, you need to restart the X-Server (that will kill off
the memory-hogging games). Most distributions don't even configure
to allow the X-Server to be restarted. Still, it's not a kernel
problem and it can't be "fixed" or "worked around" in the kernel.
When you hang the user inteface, you can interface with users.
It's really that simple.
Cheers,

Why is the government concerned about the lunatic fringe? Think about it.
