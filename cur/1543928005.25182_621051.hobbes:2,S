Looking at both other open source projects and the support of commercial 
software a web interface should be enough.
But this is not the problem - the problem is what happens after the 
initial report with the bug report.

The architecture choice seems to be the only thing from your list that
isn't already available in the "Enter a new bug report" dialog of the
kernel Bugzilla.
