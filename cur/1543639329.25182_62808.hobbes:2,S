There is an alternative.  
Use 32-bit PID's, but with an additional rule for wraparound.
Simply wrap the PID when 
(nextPID > 2*number_of_processes && nextPID > 30000)
The latter one just to avoid wrapping at 10 when there are 
5 processes.  
This simple approach supports 32-bit PIDs for those 
that need them, while "ps" and friends always looks nice 
except for those who actually run large amounts of processes.
You won't get a very large PID unless you need to.
