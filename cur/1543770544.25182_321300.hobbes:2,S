The net driver change queue has been updated, most notably with some new 
wireless drivers and wireless stack updates.
Intel contributed drivers for their Centrino hardware, "ipw2100" and 
"ipw2200".  SuSE has begun contributing work that advances the ieee80211 
stack work, taking it much closer to the goal of having ieee802.11 
support fully integrated into the network stack as "real" protocol layer.
Git repository containing a great many branches:
rsync://rsync.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/jgarzik/netdev-2.6.git
The branch of note for wireless developers is currently 'we18-ieee80211'.
Git instructions, for those needing an introduction:

And finally a patch containing _only_ the changes on the we18-ieee80211 
branch,
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/jgarzik/patchkits/2.6/2.6.12-rc5-git2-ieee80211-1.patch.bz2
Notably, this patch does not include HostAP, which is stored in a child 
branch 'we18-ieee80211-wifi'.
