From the nforce2-apictack-rd-2.6.0.patch:
 /*
+ * Athlon nforce2 R.D.
+ * preset timer ack mode if desired
+ * e.g. static int apic_timerack = 2;
From the nforce2-ioapic-rd-2.6.0.patch
+#if defined(CONFIG_ACPI_BOOT) && defined(CONFIG_X86_UP_IOAPIC)
+       /* for nforce2 try vector 0 on pin0
+        * Note 8259a is already masked, also by default
+        * the io_apic_set_pci_routing call disables the 8259 irq 0
+        * so we must be connected directly to the 8254 timer if this works
+        * Note2: this violates the above comment re Subtle but works!

I think I will need more patches, but I will test it today.
