Just for documentation the current interface is you come in through
the kernels 16bit entry point and get all of it's BIOS calls, or your
bootloader is responsible for getting the equivalent information
somehow.
From what little I skimmed part of what Gujin wanted to do was sane
at first glance. Just boot a gziped vmlinux like the other
architectures.  The problem was the 16bit code.  
So there may be some good ideas buried in there somewhere, but it
likely to take some doing, and patches that I have to save before
I read them are a real pain!
