Yes, it does appear that 2.4.0's cardbus is broke, and it is not clear
why, nor is it clear who is going to fix it, nor how, nor when.

I kept the pci driver's name as "3c575_cb" in attempt to prevent this
sort of thing, but it appears that fundamental information which the
PCMCIA package needs has been removed from 2.4.  
I did manage to get it working, but I had to kludge a few PCMCIA scripts
to do it.  Described in

I saw that as well.  But it works OK.
