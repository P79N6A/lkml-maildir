Of course at ~16k, this is a lot safer than 75 blocks which would make kmalloc
go "boom".  75 blocks is more than 140K.   Might be better to set the limit
closer to 128K for a bit more "efficiency."  48 blocks would be a bit more
"ideal" for the available size of a kmalloc (128k).  The fewer commands sent
to the drive the better IMO.
