I couldn't figure out how to do it in the config,
forgot about preprocessing. But Alan wants a menu
option instead.
Anyone who uses the embedded systems want
a different default? Let me know and I'll
put it in the default config files.
I'm sure a small hand held with fixed devices
doesn't need even a 8K buffer. Just don't know
which ones.
