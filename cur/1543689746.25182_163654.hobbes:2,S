For what it's worth, it was straight-forward to get the ia64 linux
kernel to compile & boot with the latest gcc snapshot.  I could make a
patch, if anyone cares, but it was mostly trival stuff: a small
cleanup in init_task.c and a few changes in init.h/compiler.h to use
"attribute ((used))".
Even the wait-channels seem to come out right, though I'm not sure
what's being done there is guaranteed to continue to work as the
compiler gets more aggressive...
