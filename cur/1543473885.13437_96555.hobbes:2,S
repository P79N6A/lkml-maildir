FWIW, there's not one config option on my systems that say `redhat'.
I don't see how proscribing "punishment" is any less paternalistic
than working for Red Hat Software, uml.edu, or MIT, where a lot of the
research that lead to the development of the Internet originated.
So watch where you're posting from.  I personally have a problem with
universities and the government sponsored intellectual property
tactics, which amount to legalized extortion when they're abused.  But
that doesn't mean I'm always right.  Call me idealistic.  I'm as
qualified to speak (or write) about Linux-cum-GNU as you are.
