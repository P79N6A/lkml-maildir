The kernel security team's proceedures.

I'd love to do it informally, but the rules are going to be used to make
our lives easier, by having something to point to when we want to reject
something, and having something that everyone can refer to when trying
to understand what it is we are attempting to do here.
If they get too complex, or large, we will have to revisit them.
So, let's stop arguing about the semantics of the rules, and see if what
we have proposed actually works in real-life.  If that doesn't work out,
we can revisit it then.
