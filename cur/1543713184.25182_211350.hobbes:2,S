It's not pretty, but it is intentional and correct:
the first to balance the page_cache_get higher up (well commented),
the second because add_to_page_cache does a page_cache_get but
remove_from_page_cache does not do the corresponding page_cache_release.
Christoph's problems will be somewhere in Andrea's compound page changes.
