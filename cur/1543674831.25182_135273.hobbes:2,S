You're still at a point of diminishing returns for a native driver too.
ATAPI support would be a pain.  Can't use drivers/ide/* nor ide-scsi.
Userland support is nonexistent, and users would have start using yet 
another set of tools to deal with their disks, instead of the existing 
[scsi] ones.
Device model, power management, hotplugging are all handled or 
in-the-works for scsi, and they are exactly what SATA needs.  I would 
have to recreate all that handling from scratch.
I think you're missing how much code and pain is actually saved by using 
the scsi layer...  like I mentioned in the last message, long-term, 
these issues can (and should) be solved by moving some of this stuff out 
of the scsi layer into the block layer, creating an overall desirable 
flattening effect of all code involved.

I think this can only benefit the scsi layer and continue its trend of 
becoming more lightweight and lib'ified.
WRT user confusion, I agree:  that's why PATA is a config option.  I 
would prefer people think "SATA? use my driver.  PATA? use drivers/ide"
Andre suggested that I might support PCI PATA controllers in my driver 
"officially", but I think user confusion and transition issues rule out 
that, for non-hackers.
