I've been thinking about this recently, and it turns out that the whole 
point is moot with a fixed address vsyscall page: non-exec stacks are 
trivially circumvented by using the vsyscall page as a known starting 
point for the exploite.  All the other tricks of changing the starting 
stack offset and using randomized load addresses don't help at all, 
since the exploite can merely use the vsyscall page to perform various 
operations.  Personally, I'm still a fan of the shared library vsyscall 
trick, which would allow us to randomize its laod address and defeat 
this problem.
