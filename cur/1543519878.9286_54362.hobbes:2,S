	Having it disabled by default makes sense. Trying to enforce it always
being disabled, despite the fact that some people might want it enabled, is
just arrogantly enforcing a political agenda. Its also the same condescending
attitude that might be reflected in saying something fascist like maybe
we not allow people to change mac's or put their card into promiscuous
mode unless they apply the 'illuminati patch' and recompile. Keep them
lusers from snooping and spoofing, and hey, the 'dummies' wont even notice...
  Its not a correctness issue, its a control issue.
	There are definite privicy problems facing us today, but seeking to
unilaterally squelch a virtually costless simple freedom of choice is
an example of the ends not justifying the means.
	Having said all that, I think the whole argument is somewhat moot, as
if there is demand, the option to enable will come about, either through
a kernel option or maybe a module using what the germans(?) claim can
get it even if disabled, or whatever.
	I support a config option, or a kernel command line param to enable PSN,
hell, maybe something in /proc or a sysctl, (the defaults of which are all off)
just on principle:)

ps. I dont have anything with a PSN, and while I would like to know the
number for an asset tag, cant think of a real good reason for having
this 'feature' enabled... I just dont like anyone telling me I shouldnt have
a choice.
