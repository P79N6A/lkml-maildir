Yes, by providing a real inode-like entity in swap.
This is overkill. Use a real file system for your use case. 
I think tmpfs is not suited for your need.
Tmpfs is for machines where hitting swap is unlikely but
possible. So creating all temporary FS structures in memory only
makes sense. 
For your use case it doesn't make sense and you should use a
normal file system that writes out all its state, if memory gets
thight (or the state is getting too old).
