With the kernel, it refuses to compile somehthing (checksum.S) related with
varargs in macros that is perefectly legal reading the info files for gcc.

The '22' there is the package version, not related to the gcc or kernel
version. When RH (or Mandrake) package a thing in an rpm, is thing-2.3.4-1.rpm.
If they discover the left a pair of icons at home, the new package is
thing-2.3.4-2.rpm. If they misplaced an script, new one is thing-2.3.4-3.rpm.
But thing is still 2.3.4. So you could have kernel-2.2.18pre7-1.rpm.
If they discover a patch was badly applied, public kernel-2.2.18pre7-2.rpm.
If they apply NEW patches, from pre 8, it is now kernel-2.2.18pre8-1.rpm.

And should not be that way, because 17 usually includes all the patches to
16 that mutate it in -22, and even more.
