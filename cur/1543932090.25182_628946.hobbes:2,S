Hello,
does /proc/sys/vm/swappiness still work as expected? 
# /proc/sys/vm# cat swappiness 
0
but scp-ing 2GB file causes many processes are swapped out due to increase of
the file cache size. Why? This is totally catastrophic behaviour on the desktop.
Is there a way to avoid it except turning off the swap?
