Hello,
If i remeber correctly, a while ago somebody was comparing bsd and Linux
find (different machines), and Linux/other_machine was not the fastest
I just tried:
z(tty1) 6:57pm 0 root@sjoerd:~ # time find / > /dev/null
0.780u 1.160s 0:02.10 92.3%     0+0k 0+0io 65pf+0w
on a system:
(tty1) 7:00pm 0 root@sjoerd:~ # df -m
Filesystem         MB-blocks    Used Available Capacity Mounted on
/dev/hdb9                935     778      109     88%   /

Don't know about previous kernels, but it's certenly faster what was
reported some time ago :)

Argh!  All right, so how am I supposed to work with Linux when
everything's already been done?!  Can't these people leave some
broken MSDOS like parts so there's problems left to solve!?....
