No, that would be no Problem. Often, if I browse in mutt and press Arrow
Keys, it is autorepeated suddenly but I only pressed the Key shortly!

the kernel stops repeating. That happens with all keys and when with
arrow or PageUp/Down keys in slrn it drives me mad!

This happens with 2 PS/2 Keyboards plugged into a SIS7xx and an intel
845PE Board. Using USB Keyboards works like a charme...
