io_submit() is incapable of returning operation success notifications.  
It can only return notifications of idempotent errors, since callers who 
submit multiple requests might need to call io_submit() twice to find 
out what the error was.

"MAY" is far cry from "MUST".  I object strongly to requiring all 
callers to io_submit() to be able to handle immediate completions.  In 
my aio framework, the caller of io_submit() is not in a context where it 
can invoke completion callbacks, since completion callbacks are not 
required to be reentrant.
Adding an optional facility to permit callers to receive immediate 
completions is a different issue.

For the specific conditions under discussion, it was.  The conditions 
were certainly extremely rare.

The traditional way of dealing with this is to first call the 
synchronous nonblocking interface, retrying with the asynchronous 
interface only when the nonblocking one indicates no progress.  Not only 
does this save the cost of the (expensive when poll-based) queuing 
overhead, it can save the cost of operations required only when going 
async, such as copying the data from the stack to the heap.
