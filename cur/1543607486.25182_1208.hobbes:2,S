No. That made more sense so you're fine. Still, not everyone turns them
on only for a few hours or so. For example, I have 2-4 day uptimes on my
laptop (the power of suspend to disk/ram :) so something that'll eventually
snog up on me simply because I didn't turn my laptop -off- would be damned
annoying.
