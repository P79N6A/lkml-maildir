I think what James meant is to rebase over linux-next when cutting the
patches in order to send them to the different maintainers over email.
In that case linux-next is perfect because you are sure none of the
patches will conflict with any maintainer and you do that all in one
place. Since you are not merging then linux-next volatility does not
matter.
