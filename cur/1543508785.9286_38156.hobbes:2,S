	Hi all, i've trying to use the smb support in the kernel but when
i try to load the module it says:
	unresolved symbol get_cached_page
	i searched all the source for this and found it in
include/linux/mm.h but didn't found any definition in all the .c or .s[S]
can anyone tell me what does the smbfs requires for this symbol be defined
???
	Another little matter: the pnp driver still can't configure SB
AWE 64...i've been said the card has a bug on his pnp resources...Will the
driver ever be able to configure it ???
	Thanks...
	P.D. i want to use smb because i want to connect to my friend's
machine running win98 i got a question it is posible  for me with linux
have internet access using samba (smb) and having my friend's machine as
the "server" (with his modem having the internet connection) and our
ethers ???
fito.
