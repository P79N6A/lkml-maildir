Please don't hide the branch name in the free-flowing text, and instead 
write your "please pull" messages like this:
   Please pull the upstream branch from
	git://git.infradead.org/~dedekind/ubi-2.6.git upstream
  to receive the following updates:
so that I don't miss the right branch-name even by mistake.
I try to be careful, and I think I missed the branch-name just once (and 
noticed it when the diffstat didn't match), but this is something I want 
to teach every git user to know very intimately: make it impossible to 
make mistakes, by always keeping the whole git information together, and 
never mixed up with any free-flowing explanation.
Pulled. Thanks,
		Linus
