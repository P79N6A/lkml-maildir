Randy and I got together and hashed out a first cut at this.
(Randy actually gutted quite a lot of what I originally wrote, so deserves
 much kudos for improving this beyond my initial crappy version).
You can find the script at 
http://www.codemonkey.org.uk/projects/checkpatch/
There's also a git clonable tree there (only http right now).
http://www.codemonkey.org.uk/projects/checkpatch/example.log
 shows
what fell out of running it on my mbox of lkml from the past month.
Some of them are kinda noisy, and perhaps should be moved under --pedantic
I'm all ears for additional regexps, bug reports or other suggestions.
Before wiring this up to a procmail rule to scan every patch, I think it's
probably a better idea to flesh it out a bit more.
