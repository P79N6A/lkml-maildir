You're right.  I was wrong about the identical hardware -- somebody has
recently added another 128 MB to the box, and so it has 640 MB in there
at the moment.  Most other boxes are 512 MB, and that other inactive
server was only 128 MB.  Ah, the one I was comparing it with was only 384
MB, even.  So yeah, it's probably memory-size related.
