Ok comparing the content of the original image:
# mount -t iso9660 -o ro -o loop /MultiCd/cd060213.iso /mnt/cd
# find /mnt/cd -type f -exec md5sum {} \;
37149d4961c0484f2cceb1a1614b253d  /mnt/cd/boot.cat
4ab996554b0e7ade115a3f284b876612  /mnt/cd/boot.msg
fbdc51c29d54dd227427b2ef90e1961e  /mnt/cd/initrd.cgz
92c9a50bed71257c29f069ec5dd819fc  /mnt/cd/isolinux.bin
927ce1096693b3a44af0e0d8a2ad720c  /mnt/cd/isolinux.cfg
4afcf65ff8259a3bccd0cf9f91675529  /mnt/cd/scsi.cgz
4714742585da795c3a69c262ce8c35ef  /mnt/cd/vmlinuz
and the content of the burned cd:
# mount /cdrom
# find /cdrom -type f -exec md5sum {} \;
37149d4961c0484f2cceb1a1614b253d  /cdrom/boot.cat
4ab996554b0e7ade115a3f284b876612  /cdrom/boot.msg

92c9a50bed71257c29f069ec5dd819fc  /cdrom/isolinux.bin
927ce1096693b3a44af0e0d8a2ad720c  /cdrom/isolinux.cfg

4714742585da795c3a69c262ce8c35ef  /cdrom/vmlinuz
it seems ok?
What is it lost???

yes: it was dated from the early time I was testing various distro to choose one ;-)

Ah, I never had chance to use a disk array with fc connection on one of my linux boxe, so I don't know how can it works with 
up to 255 luns?
Thanks again,
