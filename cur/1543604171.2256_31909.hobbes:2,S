	Hello,
	I'm currently running 2.4.10-ac10 on a Tyan Tiger MP with dual
Athlon 1.4 (Thunderbird), I'm having no important problems (I don't know
about UDMA100), but I'm having problems with the noapic option (that
appears in the boot log to correct an AMD errata). although I set it and
it appears in the /proc/cmdline that message stills apears. Also I'm
unable to get correct readings with lm_sensors (CVS), I've been enable
to detect the w83781d chip using the i2c-amd756 SMbus but half of the
times the kernel hangs up when loading this module. Also when I lspci
I get lots of unkown devices.
	I've attached both the boot log and the output of lspci -vvv.
	If you need more info just tell me, I'll try my best.
	Regards,
	- german
