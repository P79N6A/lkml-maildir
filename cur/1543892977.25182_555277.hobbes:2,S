I really don't mean to be rude and pointing you to read the archives, but 
the proof and the reason why claims are valid is inside there.

That is really nice solution. Each library has to have each own allocator. 
Then we'll have what, a committee that assigns fd ranges?
Ranges cannot be implemented with the current fdtable allocator, because 
they'll be way far apart and they'll waste space. Multiple separate ranges 
will require multiple fdtable structures (one for each range/allocator). 
Instead of a two-way switch (legacy and non-sequential) you will have 
multiple choices to select. This multiple choices will have to be 
replicated all around the code that access directly the fdtables. I did 
the fdmap consolidation patch, and I can tell you there are quite a few 
places that access fdtables directly.
