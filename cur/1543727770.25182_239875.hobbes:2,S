I just did some further testing, the problem here is exactly the same
as Davids.  And thinking about the exact point of failure and that
Davids reboot problem is related to the keyboard being attached or not
I realized what causes the problems for me:
I have a keyboard attached to the PS/2 port, but my mouse is attached
to USB.  So I pluged in a PS/2 mouse, and guess what?  The box
rebooted!
Well, this is by no means a solution, but I think it's pretty clear
now, what exactly causes the trouble.  Now we have to find out, why
the i8042 code in 2.6.x breaks things on sertain hardware when there
are not devices present in all ports, while in 2.4.x everything went
well...
