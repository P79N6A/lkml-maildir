The 6.01.00-fo driver from QLogic.

I was getting nailed by an issue involving reaping inodes (or the lack 
thereof). I don't believe the QLogic driver was contributing to my 
problem. I've had this driver running in my lab and at numerous client 
sites for quite some time and have never seen it even burp.

Interesting. Again, I've never seen this behavior, but I appreciate your 
mentioning it. It's definitely something to keep an eye out for.
