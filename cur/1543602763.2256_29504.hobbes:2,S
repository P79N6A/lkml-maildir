Thanks... apm=on works now, but APM functionality itself still suffers from
the same failure as before (Resource temporarily unavailble.)
I should mention that before your patch, /dev/misc/apm_bios, /dev/apm_bios
and /proc/apm were already being created by the driver; it's going through
the motions but not delivering the goods.
