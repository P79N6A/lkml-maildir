Except that as I mentioned, it's broken by design. It creates yet
another incompatible naming scheme for devices, and what's worse the
devices it breaks are the ones like ALSA and the input subsystem, whose
locations are hard-coded into libraries. Unless sysfs is going to get
attributes from which the proper names could be derived, it won't ever
work.
