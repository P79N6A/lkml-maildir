Then get rid of that warning, using -Wno-sign-compare:
The following change to the top level Makefile tells gcc not to complain
about this:
===== Makefile 1.439 vs edited =====
164c164
< HOSTCFLAGS    = -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer
---
> HOSTCFLAGS    = -Wall -Wno-sign-compare -Wstrict-prototypes -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer

< CFLAGS                := -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -Wno-trigraphs -O2 \
---
> CFLAGS                := -Wall -Wno-sign-compare -Wstrict-prototypes -Wno-trigraphs -O2 \
Would you like me to send Andrew a real patch for this?
I have been running all my personal builds with this change for a month
now, ever since I picked up some version of gcc that is fond of that
warning.
