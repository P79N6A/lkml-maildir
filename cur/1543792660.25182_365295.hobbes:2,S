I actually would prefer to do it with the new kernel thread API.
So, to create the thread:   kthread_create
bind it to a cpu:                  kthread_bind
stop it:                                kthread_stop
Now, if I call kthread_stop() in module unload time, does that code
run in user process context just like system calls do? That is
important, because if it cannot sleep, it would deadlock.
