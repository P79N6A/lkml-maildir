I suspect that removing the pci_disable_device in that driver is 
probably the best solution. It's not really mandatory to disable the 
device in all cases, we have other devices that have similar issues and 
so can't be disabled. As long as it can't generate interrupts or 
otherwise affect the system after the module is unloaded (but it sounds 
like it doesn't use interrupts anyway).
It's not really a good hardware design (mucking with one PCI function on 
the device shouldn't disable functionality on other functions), but what 
can you do..
