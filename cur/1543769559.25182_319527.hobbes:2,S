I'm impressed too ;), and very happy to finally have confirmation it
works as planned without blowing up anything.

Well I guess a happy Jean doesn't hurt! I really can't accept full
credit for this though, I think the end solution was a good mix of
ideas/comments from a range of people especially Greg, Russell and
you.
I like the idea of aggregating the related sensor attributes into
arrays, I did things the same way in bmcsensors but of course that was
all dynamic, and would just use more memory if we tried to do that
here. As Greg points out there is probably a nicer way to create the
arrays and register the attributes, but the basic idea has merit I
think, and if we can standardize a method across all the sensors then
its even better.
Thanks,
Yani
