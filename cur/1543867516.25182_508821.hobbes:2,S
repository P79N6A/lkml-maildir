Show me.  clts() and stts() are expensive hardware operations which there 
is no means of avoiding as control register writes impact the CPU in a not 
trivial manner.  I've spent far too much time staring at profiles of what 
goes on in the context switch code in the process of looking for optimizations 
on this very issue to be ignored on this point.
