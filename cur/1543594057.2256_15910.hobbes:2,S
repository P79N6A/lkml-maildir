Tricky.
net_dev_init() is in net/core/dev.c which is linked into
net/core/core.o which is linked into net/network.o which is linked into
vmlinux as part of $(NETWORKS).
drivers/s390/net creates drivers/s390/net/s390-net.o which is linked
into drivers/s390/io.o which is part of $(CORE_FILES), not $(DRIVERS).
$(NETWORKS) is linked _after_ both $(CORE_FILES) and $(DRIVERS).
Have I mentioned recently how much I hate the "link order depends on
Makefile compile order, except where fudged by special case Makefiles"
method?
David, how do any network drivers that need net_dev_init() work when
all $(DRIVERS) come before $(NETWORKS)?  This is a generic problem, not
s390 specific.
AFAICT net_dev_init() needs to be promoted ahead of $(DRIVERS), either
as minimal code or by moving all of $(NETWORKS).  Then moving
drivers/s390/io.o to $(DRIVERS) instead of $(CORE_FILES) will fix the
problem.
