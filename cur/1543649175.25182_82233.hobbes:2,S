Yes, I also feel all this per-cpu TSC stuff is not the way to go (on top
of all this per-cpu mapping, etc. you'd also have to round-robin the
timer interrupt so each cpu has a last_tsc_low value, then if cpus are
varying in freq you have to recalc that occasionally. it just gets
messy.). The current vsyscall implementation uses the TSC because on 99%
of the boxes out there, the TSC is in sync and works fine as time source
(ie: normal gettimeofday uses it). On boxes that don't use the TSC, the
vsyscall shouldn't be mapped in until we have an alternate HPET(equv)
vsyscall solution. 
I'll see if I can clean that up later today. I also didn't mind Andrea's
suggestion for using a /proc entry to disable/check for vsyscalls, so I
might give that a whirl as well. 
thanks for all the feedback, everyone!
