I've seen this error!!! It is caused by setting the bios geometry 
different than what the kernel detects when it loads. You can solve the 
problem by setting the bios geometry the same as the kernel geometry. 
Look at the info in /proc to see what the kernel thinks the drive looks 
like or watch the boot dialog. 
It might be something different in your case, but I had this problem and 
tracked it down to this issue. Had two identical drives with different 
internal software revisions that "looked" different to the linux kernel 
disk drivers.
Raid won't care, but the "partitioning" will need to change for the 
drives that have the problem, so you best remove it from the array, fix 
it, repartition, and raidhotadd it back.
