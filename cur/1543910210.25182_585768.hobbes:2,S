Please always provide at least a copy of the error message when providing
patches which fix warnings, or build errors, or section mismatches.
For section mismatches, an analysis of what caused the problem would help,
too.  It saves others from having to do the same thing.
In this case, I'd need to see what error is being fixed so that I can judge
the seriousness of the problem.  In this case I don't _think_ it'll be
terribly serious because iirc most architectures don't free exitcall memory.
