Subject: [PATCH 1/1] POWERPC: Fix ppc32 compile with gcc+SSP in 2.6.16

Hi Guys,
I think the subject and patch says it all. Please see the attached minor
fix which allows ppc32 (2.6.16) to build with a non-vanilla gcc.
This could also be fixed in BOOTCFLAGS but I felt this being the more
appropriate.
Regards,
John

Since ppc32 has been made to use arch/powerpc it has introduced a build-time
regression where userland CFLAGS are being leaked. This is especially obvious
when a user tries to "make zImage" with an SSP enabled gcc.
This patch restores sanity.
