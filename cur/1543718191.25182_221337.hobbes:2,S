Well, Kurt, thanks for the offer. I am prepared and willing to do the work
on supporting the driver, but I am, perhaps, not skilled enough to be a
maintainer of a SCSI LDD. My knowledge of the SCSI protocol and the SCSI
Linux subsystem is pretty limited. On one hand, the driver is little used,
so, even if I badly break something it is not likely to cause major
problems. On the other hand, I would feel more comfortable if, at least at
the beginning, somebody would review my patches. Besides, it would be a
good opportunity for me to really learn a bit more about SCSI, SCSI Linux
driver, BIO,...  oh well...
Thanks
Guennadi
