no, systems that remain powered while asleep are a different type of 
suspend then ones that don't.

you are starting from the assumption that ACPI S4 mode should be used.
I'm saying that a suspend that uses ACPI S4 mode is fundamentally 
different from one that does a power off instead.
from my point of view the ACPI S4 sleep mode has far more in common with 
suspend-to-ram then with the suspend-to-disk that I'm talking about
non-ACPI hibernate
   since the box powers off
     it uses zero power while suspended
     another OS could be run before a resume
     hardware can be swapped, suspend image could be sent around the world to be restored on another system.
     restore makes no assumptions about the state of the hardware when it is restored
     restore is slower (full BIOS boot is required)
   should be able to work on just about any hardware (the limit is the ability to initialize the devices)
ACPI suspends
   since the box never completely powers off:
     a complete power failure breaks the suspend
     the OS must remain in control so other uses must be prevented.
     hardware must remain in the ACPI state from suspend until restore.
     restore can be faster (some initialization may be able to be skipped)
   requires ACPI hardware support
under the catagory of ACPI suspends you have
   fast suspend-to-ram (stop scheduling, put the CPU to sleep, as long as 
the memory keeps getting refreshed)
   slow suspend-to-ram (stop scheduling, put as much of the hardware as 
possible to sleep, including spinning down disks and other things that 
take a while to undo)
   suspend-to-disk (stop scheduleing, copy the ram somewhere so that it 
doesn't need to be refreshed, put everything into low-power mode)
   and there are probably quite a few others as well. but they are all in 
the same family in that you have to worry about ACPI states, and they all 
have the same restrictions on what can happen between suspend and resume
the non-ACPI hibernate behaves very differently, and for some people (and 
I think I am one of them) it will meet their needs better then _any_ of 
the ACPI suspends.
