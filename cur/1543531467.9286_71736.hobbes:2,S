You're right, except for one thing: msdos_partition is called before
osf_partition. Since the disklabel does have the 0x55aa signature,
msdos_partition will be hapy with whatever junk it finds in the partition
table, and thus osf_partition will never get a chance to run.
Would it be reasonable to switch the two, and also to update the docs so
that other people will know what to enable? If so, I'd be happy to come up
with the patch.
Thanks,
Ion
