Ted,
Using version 2.1.131, I cannot set the baud rate of a terminal
to a speed higher than 38400 baud without cheating and using the
`setserial spd_hi` function. This function now results in a
warning message that it has been deprecated.
From termbits.h
#define  B38400	0000017    Works and everything below.
#define  B57600  0010001   Sets baud-rate to about 600 baud
#define  B115200 0010002   Sets baud-rate to about 1240 baud
#define  B230400 0010003   Sets baud-rate to about 800 baud
#define  B460800 0010004   Sets baud-rate to about 900 baud
Is this a bug or have I forgotten to set some magic high-speed
bit?
    /*
     * Set to dumb RAW mode with no echo and no character interpretation.
     */
    memset(&io_mod, 0x00, sizeof(io_mod));
    io_mod.c_cflag     = B57600|CS8|CREAD|CLOCAL;
    io_mod.c_iflag     = IGNBRK|IGNPAR;
    io_mod.c_cc[VMIN]  = (cc_t) 1;
    io_mod.c_cc[VTIME] = (cc_t) 1;
    if(ioctl(fd, TCSETS, &io_mod) < 0) 
    {
        fprintf(stderr, "ioctl of %s failed setting parameters (%s)\n",
                         argv[1], strerror(errno));
        ERROR_EXIT;
    }
    There were no errors. The speed is now about 600 baud!
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
