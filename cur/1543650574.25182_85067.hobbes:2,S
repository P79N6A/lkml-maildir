Yes, people use it.  Not quite sure why though, I guess ACLs
buy some flexibility over the user/group/other model but if
the "unlimited groups" patch goes in (is in?) I'm happy ;)
Personally I do think either the unlimited groups patch or
ACLs are needed in order to sanely run a large anoncvs setup.
