48.5 day increments, not 497. On alpha and ia64 it's 1024 jiffies per
second.
Well, ok. Majority of the 64-bit archs seem to in fact use HZ=100:
asm-alpha/param.h:#  define HZ  1024
asm-ia64/param.h:# define HZ    1024
asm-mips64/param.h:#define HZ 100
asm-ppc64/param.h:#define HZ 100
asm-s390x/param.h:#define HZ 100
asm-sparc64/param.h:#define HZ 100
asm-x86_64/param.h:#define HZ 100
