Hi
I was just burning a cd with gcombust on a Traxdata 2260+ (rebadged Phillips
drive) and it failed part way through with the following messages in
/var/log/messages:
Feb  2 14:18:13 bitch kernel: scsi : aborting command due to timeout : pid
14687, scsi2, channel 0, id 0, lun 0 Write (10) 00 00 01 29 b0 00 00 10 00  
Feb  2 14:18:13 bitch kernel: hdb: irq timeout: status=0xd0 { Busy } 
Feb  2 14:18:15 bitch kernel: hdb: ATAPI reset complete 
Feb  2 14:18:15 bitch kernel: hdb: irq timeout: status=0xd0 { Busy } 
Feb  2 14:18:17 bitch kernel: hdb: ATAPI reset complete 
Feb  2 14:18:17 bitch kernel: hdb: irq timeout: status=0xd0 { Busy }
The drive is ATAPI (hdb) and I have the ide-scsi module loaded and using
that drive (by way of an append line in /etc/lilo.conf).
The drive shares an IDE chain with a Maxtor DiamondMax 8GB UDMA hard disk.
The ISO image being burned was read from an IBM UltraStar 18ES LVD drive on
an Adaptec 2940U2W controller. The box is a dual Celeron 433 on the ABit BP6
motherboard with 256MB of RAM - at the time it was running X, gcombust
(obviously!), a single Eterm and xmms (playing an mp3 from the LVD drive) -
rc5 was running on both CPUs too if that is relevant.
Is this a bug or a fault at my end? (let me know if you need more info).
