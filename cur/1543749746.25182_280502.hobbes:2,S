A copyright holder can re-release their code under any license they 
choose, even if
they have released under GPL previously.  This is because GPL code 
really isn't free,
it's owned by the copyright holder.  And honestly, the way the GPL is 
worded it
in fact affects an implied transfer of copyright ownership to whomeve 
receives it.
Truly free code isn't copyrighted by any individual, or is copyrighted 
by an organization
that uses a license that really is free.
