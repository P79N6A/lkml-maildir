Could be a hardware problem. Check the errata/bios updates for your 
board or system. I had a similar problem and it turned out to be a 
hardware BUG with an Intel server board. It is funny the way they 
describe the bug -- it is a manufacturer problem that affects only one 
of 5 (or 6, I do not remember)  PCI slots. If you have a card in that 
slot, the system locks up under loads randomly. They solve it with a 
BIOS upgrade by degrading PCI clocks on all of the slots!
The BIOS upgrade did solve my problem and the system uptime has been 
above 4 months now. Before the upgrade, the system crashed once each 
24-48 hours.
