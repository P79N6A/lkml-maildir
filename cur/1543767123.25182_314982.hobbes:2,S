Typo with<->without?
Yes. That's what I suggested as a "special magic number". Only if that magic
is written as syscall number at the first interception, syscall_trace() would
modify regs->trap to -1.
Currently my patch uses -1 as the magic number, but there might be better
choices.

Not only -Eyyy, but all values unequal to "special magic number" could leave
regs->trap intact.

It's easier for s390-kernel, but from UML's point of view, the magic number
solution would be better.
Anyway, if you decide not to allow the magic number, we have to find a way
to use PTRACE_SETTRAP in UML without having to call it too often (Performance).
Because of UML's splitting in kernel-obj and user-obj, this might be a bit
tricky.
BTW: I see no reason to implement PTRACE_GETTRAP, as
PTRACE_SETOPTIONS/PTRACE_TRACESYSGOOD give us a way to distinguish between
syscall interceptions and other SIGTRAPs.
