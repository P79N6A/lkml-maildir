Two alerts regarding filesystem hierarchy:
The location that has been suggested, /var/shm, is a very bad choice.
/var is a potentially-large filesystem which isn't necessarily
available during the early boot sequence, may be remote, etc.
Furthermore, /var is used for on-disk data.
The proper location for entities like this is /dev.  The only sensible
location for this is /dev/shm.
The second is that devfs seems to think it is above the normal way of
doing things (unlike ALL OTHER filesystems, including procfs and
shmfs) and not only will mount itself on /dev automatically, but will
do so *by default*.  This is incredibly antisocial behaviour, and has
no justification.  If there are conditions under which you would need
devfs before you have mount(8) available -- which I do not believe is
ever the case -- it may be justifiable to have it as an option, but
making it default behaviour is pretty much unacceptable.  Use
/etc/fstab like everything else, please.
