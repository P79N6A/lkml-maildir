Hi 
>  bk-usb.patch
hmm, did something changed in handling USB mice? starting with 2.6.5-rc3-mm1 
and the included bk-usb.patch my USB mouse won't work anymore. Using 
bk-usb.patch from 2.6.5-rc2-mm5 in 2.6.5-rc3-mm4 all works fine for me.
Attached are 2 files, one from 2.6.5-rc2-mm5 bk-usb and the other one is 
2.6.5-rc3-mm4 bk-usb. Seems the latter one does not proper init hid though 
the module is loaded.
ciao, Marc
