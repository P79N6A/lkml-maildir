Having the constants in some well-known header file should be sufficient,
shouldn't it ?

It depends on the platform and maybe the exact PCI slot used, but I don't
think it depends on the driver (unless MSI support is broken in which case
you would want to fix it up in the driver).  At least I can't find
anything in the PCI 2.2 spec that would suggest we need to consult the
driver before enabling MSIs with one message only.

.. at least until someone comes out with a PCI board that supports MSI
interrupts only.
