Can both of you guys elaborate on what "break" means here, I'm trying to 
better understand what's going on. One thing is rather obvious, and that's 
what causing the current breakage with RH8 binutils:
If "." isn't properly aligned, __kstart___ksymtab will point to an address
which is before the actual start of the section, since that gets aligned 
to its requirements. Was that the ARM problem?
Now, what's different for __bss, i.e. what goes wrong there?
Related issue: The linker will actually automatically emit
__{start,stop}_SECTION symbols when SECTION is a C symbol (i.e.  
letters,numbers,_), so things should actually work without explicitly
defining those symbols. They do on i386 with my binutils, but I assume
there's some reason why we don't just rely on that?
