Well, it would be nice if the explanation was that easy - but the recent
corruption (with the man page) was on my root partition, which is not on
LVM and has never been resized.

Be assured that at least after the first corruption I observed, I did
forced e2fsck on all partitions. Without any errors found.

What do you mean with 'by journal'? The filesystems were unmounted (or
remounted r/o), so the journal should have been committed and empty at
e2fsck time.

But this should definitely have been detected by an fsck, right?

Root fs is 94% full, and during apt-get upgrade sometimes becomes
completely full. (Which I don't like, because it probably causes bad
fragmentation...)

I agree it's probably not a sync problem. And therefore, probably not
really a laptop-mode bug, even if laptop-mode triggered the corruption.
I suspected the hard drive to mess up write requests during spin-up. Or
perhaps giving some kind of error message, which could trigger a bug in
a rarely tested error-handling path in the kernel. But the fact that you
never got similar reports makes this less likely. In the end, I have to
consider there may be some bad hardware in my laptop. (Already did a
memtest86, of course.)
