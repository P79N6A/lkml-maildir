the oops shows an infinite page fault, the actual point of fault is not
visible. To make it visible, could you please apply the following patch to
your tree and check the serial console? It should now just print a single
line (showing the faulting EIP) and freeze forever:
   pagefault at: 12341234. locking up now.
Please look up the EIP via gdb:
	gdb ./vmlinux
	list *0x12341234
(for this you'll have to add '-g' to CFLAGS in the top level Makefile.)

i'll try these tests. Does the test use RT scheduling as well?
