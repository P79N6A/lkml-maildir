I was asking around, and was told that on IA64 *harware* at least, in addition to 
supporting multiple page sizes (up to a GB IIRC), one can pin up to 8 or perhaps 
1/2 the TLB entries.
So, in theory if one were so inclined the special pinned per-CPU entry could 
either be more than one 64K entry, or a single, rather larger entry.
As a sanity check, I've cc'd linux-ia64.
