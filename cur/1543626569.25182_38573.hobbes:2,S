A very sane thing to do.  Which makes the requirements/assumptions
in misc.c broken.

O.k.  Than PXELINUX does what I would expect, instead of what seems to
be requested by the boot.txt

Unless the fact is only recorded in the e820 memory map...

I agree.  But I do think being able to hard code the load address is a
very good thing.
After digesting the requirements I plan on having setup.S call int 12h
(so the information is available), and then having misc.c relocate the
real mode code, and the command line, out of the way, of it's
decompression buffer.  This removes the need for bootloaders to
make a tradeoff between memory use efficiency and reliability.
This should give me about 630KB on machines designed to run DOS, where
this matters.   Better than the current best of 572KB, with the real
mode code @ 0x90000. 
And when your total size is 1-4MB.  +-640KB is a significant change.
