Hi all,
Hoping it was a problem with the older driver, I upgraded from 2.2.1 to
2.2.9 last week. I compiled the bttv driver as a module, but it has problems
detecting the right card (old Hauppauge with PAL tuner, often mistaken for a
Miro). The standalone driver from Ralph which I used under 2.0 kernels had
an option for forcing the card type. Can anyone tell me if this option is
still available ? I browsed the bttv source, but I am by no way a (kernel)
programmer, and I was unable to find anything regarding to module options in
bttv.[ch]. Normally when the wrong card is detected, I rmmod and insmod the
module again (same params) and after a couple attempts it finds the right
card and everything works fine. So I am looking for either the appropriate
module option, or a patch to modify the driver not to autodetect the card
type.
Please CC: me any replys.
