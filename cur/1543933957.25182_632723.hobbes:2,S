| it's certainly acceptable as newly introduced code but only borderline

| after the borderline cases will only result in coding-style lawyering 
| and flamewars, not any genuine increase in code quality ;-)
| 
| for example:
| 
|   arch/x86/kernel/bootflag.c:
| 
|   total: 19 errors, 2 warnings, 98 lines checked
| 
| or:
| 
|   arch/x86/kernel/apm_32.c:
| 
|   total: 56 errors, 31 warnings, 2402 lines checked
| 
| and once we have nothing but the borderline cases and if we get really 
| bored we can start coding style flamewars ;-)
