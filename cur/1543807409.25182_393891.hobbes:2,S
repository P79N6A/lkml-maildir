Eh, but you are expected to do that. If everybody sent in half-assed not
tested patches "just because" it's a pre-rc, things would look bad.
Compile testing is the least time consuming and easiest thing to to
test, so you should at least do that. If nobody did that, no one would
get snapshots tested because they would never compile for anyone.
For developers it's equally annoying. I typically update my tree every
morning and run with that for the various stuff I'm working on, and it
is really annoying to have to spent time on hunting down and fixing
compile errors.
This mail is about the mentality displayed, not the specific change that
spawned it.
