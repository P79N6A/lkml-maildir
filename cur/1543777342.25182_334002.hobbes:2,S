Please copy all the mails related to kexec and kdump problems to
fastboot mailing list also (fastboot@lists.osdl.org).
Instead of modifying reboot scripts, first can you try following simple 
steps from shell.
1. Load the kernel.
#kexec -l <kernel-image> --append=<boot time options>
2. Drop to run level 3 
# init 3
3. Exec into second kernel
# kexec -e
Thanks
