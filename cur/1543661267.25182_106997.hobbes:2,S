This boots fine here. Then again 2.5.59 booted fine aswell. :) I also
don't get any oopses from reading /proc/bus/pnp stuff as I did before
when I first reported issues. As with the bootup, I also don't get these
issues with 2.5.59. (ie 2.5.59 works fine with or without this patch).
Sorry for not getting back to you earlier btw... I lost almost a
fortnights worth of email and yours was amongst them. :/
