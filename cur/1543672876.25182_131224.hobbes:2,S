Justin, just to complete the picture: as I wrote some days ago concerning your
hint to "use the latest from ..." your latest driver does not complete booting
on (at least) my system but freezes - which I wrote to LKML. I have not yet
heard
anything about this issue. You cannot expect to include a newer driver which
performs obviously worse in some cases.
"Worse" here means "fails" and not "performs bad". Marcelos' decision on the
topic looks pretty reasonable to me...
Regards,
Stephan
