It makes the card usable in a standard machine before the kernel has
booted.  I don't care about that at all from a technical viewpoint, as
there are better ways to deal with it, (re-write the system BIOS to
use the framebuffer for the BIOS configuration, for example), but I
can see that there may be a marketing reason for including VGA - more
people are likely to buy the card.  Whether this is significant
depends on the market we try to sell it in, and whether cost per unit
would be increased by the extra complexity, or decreased by the higher
volume of production possible if more units are going to be sold.
A cheap cludge would be an optional second GPU on the card just to do
the required VGA modes, with an analogue video pass-through.  That
would make the VGA cards more expensive than a single GPU which
incorporated VGA, but add almost nothing in cost or complexity terms
to the non-VGA cards.
