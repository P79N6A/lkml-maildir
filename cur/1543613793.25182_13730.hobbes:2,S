   Let me introduce you to this neat invention called a telephone.  It's
   the black thing next to your desk, it rings, has buttons.  If you push
   the right buttons, well, it's magic...
I'm not calling Holland every time I want to poke Jens about
something in a patch we're working on :-)
I hate telephones for technical stuff, because people can call the
fucking thing when I am not behind my computer or even worse when I AM
behind my computer and I want to concentrate on the code on my screen
without being disturbed.  With IRC it is MY CHOICE to get involved in
the discussion, I can choose to respond or not respond to someone, I
can choose to be available or not available at any given time.  It's
just a real-time version of email.  And the "passive, I can ignore
you" part is what I like about it.
Telephones frankly suck for discussing technical topics.  I can't cut
and paste pieces of code from my other editor buffer to show you over
the phone, as another example as to why.
A lot of people like to use telephones specifically because it does
not give the other party the option of ignoring you once they pick up
the phone.  I value the ability to make the choice to ignore people
because a lot of ideas I don't give a crap about come under my nose.
In fact that may be one of the best parts about Linux development
compared to doing stuff at a company, one isn't required to listen to
someone's idea or to even read it.  If today I don't give a crap about
Joe's filesystem idea, hey guess what I'm not going to read any of his
emails about the thing.
