Thanks for the clarification. I do not profess to be an expert in the
technology. Two writes or a read+write per clock cycle is close enough
for the purpose of the discussion.
The point I was trying to make is that the registers are there to deal
with an SMP race condition of some sort. Athlon MP motherboards fitted
with two processors will not work properly without 'registered' RAM. I
have hard experience of this and it this experience I am sharing with
someone who is seeing the same symptoms.
