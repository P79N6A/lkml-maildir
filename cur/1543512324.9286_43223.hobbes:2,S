It was proposed in another thread to "overmount" or "unionize" devfs
with an underlying file system, so the underlying file system provides 
the persistence. I would like this functionality for /proc, so
permissions can be altered permanently with just chown and chgrp.
Extra nice would be if the contents of the files in /proc/sys/* was
persistent, so I could take
echo '0' >/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_timestamps
out of my rc.local. That is probably not practical for files in other
parts of the /proc hierachy.
