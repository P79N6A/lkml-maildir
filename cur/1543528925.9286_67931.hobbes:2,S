What about the view that the GPL prohibits sub-licensing (such as what
the UCB file has) ?
What about the view that the UCB copyright places restrictions (albeit
very light) which are not present in the GPL ?  Specifically this:
 * 2. Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright
 *    notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the
 *    documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.
Wouldn't this fly in the face of section 6 of the GPL ?
