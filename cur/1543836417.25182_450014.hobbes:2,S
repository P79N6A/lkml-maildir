Patches should be made against latest mainline kernel, e.g.,
2.6.18-rc3 (unless they are specifically for an -mm patch),
although it probably doesn't matter in this case.

1/  Thunderbird is breaking (splitting) your lines for you.  :(
See if 
http://mbligh.org/linuxdocs/Email/Clients/Thunderbird
helps any.  Try sending a patch to yourself and test if you
can apply it.  Or use a different mail client/app.
Those 7 lines above should be 3 lines.
You may need to unset some "flowed" attribute in tbird
(I'm not sure of its full, correct name.)
2/  Either thunderbird is converting tabs to spaces or the
driver source does not contain tabs -- just lots of spaces.
Please indent struct fields with one tab, embedded struct fields
with 2 tabs, etc.
3/  Macro continuation lines should be indented.
4/  sysfs files should contain only one value per file.  Use
multiple files for multiple values.
5/  Code labels should not be indented or maybe indented one space,
and certainly not indented more than the following source lines.
6/  device_create_file() and friends can return errors.  They need
to be checked for success/fail.
7/  Header files should be included in linux/ alpha order, then
asm/ alpha order, then local.h files unless there are reasons
that this order won't work.
(Yes, only linux/ applies here.)
