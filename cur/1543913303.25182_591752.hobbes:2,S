Nope - kbuild does this for you.
See following lines from top-level Makefile:
%.ko: prepare scripts FORCE
        $(Q)$(MAKE) KBUILD_MODULES=$(if $(CONFIG_MODULES),1)   \
        $(build)=$(build-dir) $(@:.ko=.o)
        $(Q)$(MAKE) -f $(srctree)/scripts/Makefile.modpost
But as pointed out it fails to create MODVERDIR.
I had one take on it some time ago and do not recall why I failed
to fix it. Should be trivial.
But this is a small issue that has been there for a long time
and is not -rc material. I will try to have it fixed for
next merge window.
