Hi All!
I want to bind to non-local IP and send/receive UDP packets.
But when I try to connect to remote end I get an error (although bind itself
is successful).
I examined the udp_connect and tcp_v4_connect and I found an
interesting difference between them.
In udp_connect:
err = ip_route_connect(&rt, usin->sin_addr.s_addr, sk->saddr,
                       sk->ip_tos|sk->localroute, sk->bound_dev_if);
                       ^^^^^^^^^^^
                         (1)
but in tcp_v4_connect:
        tmp = ip_route_connect(&rt, nexthop, sk->saddr,
              RT_TOS(sk->ip_tos)|RTO_CONN|sk->localroute, sk->bound_dev_if);
              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                        (2)
If I see it right, this difference is used only in the ip_route_output_slow
function when it checks whether I can connect or not.
The question is whether there will be any problem if I rewrite (1) to (2)? I
tried doing this and seems to work fine.
Is there any reason not to do this?
Any help is appreciated.
