Hi Marcelo,
Great!
I've been maintaining the ACPI branch in a bk tree for the past year, so
there are 100+ changesets nicely commented. Just doing a bk pull from
that would be the best way to maintain checkin comments. bk pull
http://linux-acpi.bkbits.net/linux-2.4-acpi
 .
I can also export the changesets if you'd like to review them, but they
won't apply cleanly to the tip, since they originally were against a
much older version.
Another option would be to take the raw .diff and re-carve it by files
modified - the arch/i386 changes, the interpreter changes, the old ospm
removal, the new ospm addition, all the headers moving to include/acpi.
I'm certainly willing to do that but that would lose the changelogs and
patch attributions.
Thanks -- Regards -- Andy
