Fairness and interactiveness are very hard to quantify and
measure, which makes it hard to justify patches that improve
this behaviour.
On the other hand, patches that improve benchmark results
are easily justifyable, which makes it easy to merge those
even if it comes at the expense of fairness.
I think fairness and robustness are important, but I have
not figured out a way to justify such changes for upstream
inclusion.  Well, except perhaps by coming up with artificial
test cases, but that feels like cheating :)

The database people disagree.  For one, the accessed bit
on active page gets pages gets ignored, so Linux does not
properly keep the most actively used page cache pages in
memory.
Secondly, the VM can waste quite a lot of time scanning
over the anonymous pages that it does not even want to
evict from memory.  If the VM does not plan on evicting
anonymous memory (or shared memory segments), why waste
CPU time scanning them and randomizing their LRU order?
