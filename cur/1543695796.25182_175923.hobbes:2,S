Oh, and next time, please use a working email address.
   ----- The following addresses had permanent fatal errors -----
<linuxkernel@deepthot.org>
    (reason: 550 Unrouteable address)
   ----- Transcript of session follows -----
... while talking to mail.deepthot.org.:
>>> DATA
<<< 550 Unrouteable address
550 5.1.1 <linuxkernel@deepthot.org>... User unknown
<<< 503 valid RCPT command must precede DATA
I'd have liked not to pollute linux-kernel with the answer, as I presume
it's already known by almost all people. So a private email would have
been my first choice.
