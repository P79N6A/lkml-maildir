Hi folks,
I really like to get Tux displayed on the screen at boot time
(you should see our SMP machines with hyperthreading activated),
but if I enter single user mode, then the first 5 lines remain
unusable. I can clear the whole screen, but on scrolling upwards
the first 5 lines are stuck.
Any idea?
Regards
Harri
