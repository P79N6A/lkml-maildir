It is necessary that the handler is called.  This is the purpose of
these interfaces.  If this means more complexity is needed then this is
how the cookie crumbles.  One use case for pselect would be something
like this:
int got_signal;
void sigint_handler(int sig) {
  got_signal = 1;
}
{
  ...
  while (1) {
    if (!got_signal)
      pselect()
    if (got_signal) {
      handle signal
      got_signal = 0;
    }
  }
  ...
}
