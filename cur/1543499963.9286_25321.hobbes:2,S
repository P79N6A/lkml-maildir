    Proposed answer: have the concatenation contain separators.  rdf (not
    rich document format, but some XML replacement also called rdf) was
    suggested by Loic@ceic.com as the standard for the separators.
If you want to support using this feature for existing files, it is a
mistake to look for one "standard" format.  You need to support a
variety of formats--the ones people *already use* for such files.
    Proposed answer: implement file content inheritance.
That could mean lots of things.  I can't tell whether you're talking
about the idea that won't work, or some other idea that might work.
