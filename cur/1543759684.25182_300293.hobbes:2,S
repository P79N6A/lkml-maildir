This code is alread a bit odd.  If we're prepared to sleep in there, then
why use GFP_ATOMIC?
If it is so that we can dig a bit deeper into the free page pools then
something like __GFP_WAIT|__GFP_HIGH would be preferable.
And why isn't mem_flags passed into pool_alloc_page() verbatim?
I agree on the TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE change: if the calling task happens to
have signal_pending() then the schedule_timeout() will fall right through. 
Why should we change kernel memory allocation strategy if the user hit ^C? 
Also, __set_current_state() can be user here: the add_wait_queue() contains
the necessary barriers.  (Grubby, but we do that in quite a few places with
this particular code sequence (we should have an add_wait_queue() variant
which does the add_wait_queue+__set_current_state all in one hit (but let's
not, else I'll be buried in another 1000 cleanuplets))).
