personally I think it's a bad misfeature by itself.  If you absolutely
want it make it a mount option so it's explicit at least.
And yes, the only place where ROOT_DEV makes sense is in the early boot
process where the first filesystem in the first namespace is mounted, that's
why I want to get rid of the export to modules for it.
