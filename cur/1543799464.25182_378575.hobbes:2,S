These are issues being reported by the firmware in the adapter, looks
like you have a bad drive. Since the adapter 'hides' the physical
devices behind arrays. The array associated with id 9 is whining, but I
do not know which physical is being naughty.
A driver change will make no difference, use the management applications
to discover which target is misbehaving, probably would not hurt to
contact Adaptec technical support, especially if you have an
incompatible drive (often can be fixed by a firmware update to the
drive). They also can help you through the cookbook discovery of cable
and setting issues.
