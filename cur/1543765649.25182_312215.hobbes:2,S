The rule of "optimize for the common" fails miserably in this case
because this is not a common case/usage of qdiscs.
I have a feeling though that the patch went in due to
dude-optimizing-loopback as pointed by Herbert. 
It could also be it was done because  RCU-is-so-cool. I dont recall.
Maybe worth reverting to the earlier scheme if it is going to continue
to be problematic.
