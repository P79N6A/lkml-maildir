Dear diary, on Mon, Nov 04, 2002 at 12:17:04AM CET, I got a letter,
where Matt Pharr <matt@pharr.org> told me, that...
..snip..
> After 2.5 boots, my keyboard doesn't seem to be recognized (it's an
> old-style one plugged into the keyboard port, not a USB keyboard).
> Everything is fine up to the login: prompt, but then any key I hit doesn't
> cause anything to happen (including ctrl-alt-del).
..snip..
> I don't think I did anything dumb in the configuration step--I used my
> working 2.4.19 .config file, did a 'make oldconfig', and answered questions
> in conservative ways.  In particular, I do have CONFIG_INPUT_KEYBOARD set

> CONFIG_INPUT_KEYBOARD=y
> CONFIG_INPUT_MOUSE=y
> # CONFIG_MOUSE_INPORT is not set
> # CONFIG_MOUSE_LOGIBM is not set
> # CONFIG_MOUSE_PC110PAD is not set
> # CONFIG_INPUT_JOYSTICK is not set
> # CONFIG_INPUT_TOUCHSCREEN is not set
> CONFIG_INPUT_MISC=y
> CONFIG_INPUT_PCSPKR=y
> # CONFIG_INPUT_UINPUT is not set
Try to answer yes to the Serial i/o support (under Input device support) and
then enable support of the i8042 PC Keyboard controller.
Making the keyboard configuration under 2.5.x more obvious is currently in the
process of discussion.
