Subject: [PATCH] Uninline kcalloc()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/9/22/116

This saves some bytes on usual config here and allows inserting integer
overflow warning without pissing off printk-haters crowd later on.

- * kcalloc - allocate memory for an array. The memory is set to zero.
- * @n: number of elements.
- * @size: element size.
- * @flags: the type of memory to allocate.
- *
- * The @flags argument may be one of:
- *
- * %GFP_USER - Allocate memory on behalf of user.  May sleep.
- *
- * %GFP_KERNEL - Allocate normal kernel ram.  May sleep.
- *
- * %GFP_ATOMIC - Allocation will not sleep.  May use emergency pools.
- *   For example, use this inside interrupt handlers.
- *
- * %GFP_HIGHUSER - Allocate pages from high memory.
- *
- * %GFP_NOIO - Do not do any I/O at all while trying to get memory.
- *
- * %GFP_NOFS - Do not make any fs calls while trying to get memory.
- *
- * %GFP_NOWAIT - Allocation will not sleep.
- *
- * %GFP_THISNODE - Allocate node-local memory only.
- *
- * %GFP_DMA - Allocation suitable for DMA.
- *   Should only be used for kmalloc() caches. Otherwise, use a
- *   slab created with SLAB_DMA.
- *
- * Also it is possible to set different flags by OR'ing
- * in one or more of the following additional @flags:
- *
- * %__GFP_COLD - Request cache-cold pages instead of
- *   trying to return cache-warm pages.
- *
- * %__GFP_HIGH - This allocation has high priority and may use emergency pools.
- *
- * %__GFP_NOFAIL - Indicate that this allocation is in no way allowed to fail
- *   (think twice before using).
- *
- * %__GFP_NORETRY - If memory is not immediately available,
- *   then give up at once.
- *
- * %__GFP_NOWARN - If allocation fails, don't issue any warnings.
- *
- * %__GFP_REPEAT - If allocation fails initially, try once more before failing.
- *
- * There are other flags available as well, but these are not intended
- * for general use, and so are not documented here. For a full list of
- * potential flags, always refer to linux/gfp.h.
