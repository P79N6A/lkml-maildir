yeah, it shows up frequently, but it's hard to fix.
for a well-cached kernel rebuild on a system with lots of RAM and lots 
of CPUs, files_lock is the leading lock. (because the dcache is mostly 
populated already) files_lock is even more of a problem for workloads 
that do lots of open()/close() [Apache comes to mind].
