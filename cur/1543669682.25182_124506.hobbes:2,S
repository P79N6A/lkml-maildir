Broken link - removal event [my fault, should have explained];
still, this is kind of broken because of what you mention in
the next paragraph and because it limits you to just two types
of events - addition and removal.
I like better the having of a file where you can get events
from (that at the end goes with the select() thingie).

Sure - let's just not forget it and build on top of it little
by little.
