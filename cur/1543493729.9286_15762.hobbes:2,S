Well right now total number of caps is less than 32 so it would be good to
start out with. As you define more caps you begin to reserve others in
their place. You just don't try growing them too fast.

You have a compatible period where the checks are
capable(CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH)||capable(CAP_DAC_foo) where foo is either
READ or SEARCH
or if you needed both 
capable(CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH)||(capable(CAP_DAC_READ)&&capable(CAP_DAC_SEARCH))
After enough time then you make a CAP_OBSOLETE .
I guess thats also why capability.h has _LINUX_CAPABILITY_VERSION defined,
and elf header stuff has room for version info. caps are might be very
fluid. Maybe you need libc support to translate ascii string cap
descriptions to bitmasks? compile_caps ???
At the very least being able to ask the kernel a few questions would be
useful.

Yes portability concerns between different versions of un*x including
future ones are important. If you haven't moved to autoconf yet, now is
the time. Maybe you need a set of macros to produce capability bitmasks at
compile time.

I think a macro facility might help.
Define a few fatter profiles like power, normal, net_power,net_normal,
file_power, file_normal, reserved_power, reserved_normal, power_admin
,usr then you can do a macro thing at compile time like
then you can choose normal+net_power-FEW_NET_THINGS_I_KNOW_ABOUT
Anyway something to think about. Just musing about different things.

Yes I what to strengthen the formula not weaken it.
pP'= (fP & x) | (fI & pI & pP)
for proper files x can be ~0 otherwise 0 .
