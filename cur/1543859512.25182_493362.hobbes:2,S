Look at "cache.h": the first thing it does is to include 
"git-compat-util.h". And THAT in turn does include ALL the headers you 
added (string.h, netdb.h and unistd.h).
So it would appear that for OS X, the
	#define _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED 1 /* AIX 5.3L needs this */
	#define _GNU_SOURCE
	#define _BSD_SOURCE
sequence actually _disables_ those things.
Some googling finds a python source diff:
	   # On Mac OS X 10.4, defining _POSIX_C_SOURCE or _XOPEN_SOURCE
	   # disables platform specific features beyond repair.
	-  Darwin/8.*)
	+  Darwin/8.*|Darwin/7.*)
	     define_xopen_source=no
	     ;;
(and Ruby shows up as well in the google)
Can you try to grovel around in the OS X headers, and see what the magic 
is to enable all the compatibility crud on OS X?
