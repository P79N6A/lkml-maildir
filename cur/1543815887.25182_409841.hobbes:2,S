This only works if you have all possible dreamed of interface bits in
the ABI. In Linux, we often don't know what we'll need to support in the
future, but we don't write binary compatible interfaces just in case we
need to update.  Preferring instead, API's that are justifiable right now.
This is the issue I have with the ABI proposal.  It doesn't fit well
with Linux developement.
