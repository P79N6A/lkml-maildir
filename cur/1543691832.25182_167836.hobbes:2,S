Hello all,
This is the first time I am trying to compile a kernel and I have found a lot 
of problems that I have solved. All but one.
I have my kernel compiled and working fine but I have had to chose the 386 
option for the processor type. I have a Pentium 4 but when I compile the 
kernel changing the processor type to "Pentium 4" (I don't change any other 
parameter) and boot the computer with that kernel it hangs at the "Ok, 
booting the kernel" step.
Has someone seen something like this?. Could you help me?
