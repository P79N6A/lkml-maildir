I am interested in experimenting with Fibre Channel at a low level
(layer FC-2), preferably using off-the-shelf hardware.
But as near as I can tell browsing the Linux source, Fibre Channel and
SCSI seem to be joined at the hip.
Questions:
- Is there a user-space interface to access the raw Fibre Channel
protocol via an ordinary HBA?
- If not, are the kernel internals such that doing this from kernel
space would be relatively straightorward?
- Or is this just a bad idea?
Again, my goal is to bypass the SCSI protocol entirely.  Put another
way, I want to implement my own upper-level protocol on top of FC-2,
but without having to re-write an entire HBA driver.
Any pointers (however brief) or redirection to a more appropriate
forum would be appreciated.
Thank you!
