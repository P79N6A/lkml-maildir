Andrew,
test9-mm2 is still getting slab corruption with AIO:
Maximal retry count.  Bytes done 0
Slab corruption: start=dc70f91c, expend=dc70f9eb, problemat=dc70f91c
Last user: [<c0192fa3>](__aio_put_req+0xbf/0x200)
Data: 00 01 10 00 00 02 20 00 *********6C ******************************A5
Next: 71 F0 2C .A3 2F 19 C0 71 F0 2C .********************
slab error in check_poison_obj(): cache `kiocb': object was modified after freeing
With suparna's retry-based-aio-dio patch, there are no kernel messages
and the tests do not see any uninitialized data.
Any reason not to add suparna's patch to -mm to fix these problems?
Thanks,
Daniel
