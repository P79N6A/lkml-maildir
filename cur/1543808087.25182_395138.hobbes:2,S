Would perhaps a less drastic solution, that at least supports the common
partitioned-system configuration, be to limit the oom killer to processes
whose nodes are a *subset* of ours?
That way, a limited process won't kill any unlimited processes, but it
can fight with other processes with the same limits.  However, an
unlimited process discovering oom can kill anything on the system if
necessary.
(This requires a modified version of cpuset_excl_nodes_overlap that
calls nodes_subset() instead of nodes_intersects(), but it's pretty
straightforward.)
