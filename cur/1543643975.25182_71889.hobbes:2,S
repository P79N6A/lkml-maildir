Sorry, I was debugging some boot-time issues I ran into.
I did this intentionally. Basically, sys_setsid() does the right thing,
but tty_ioctl() does not. There is already some inconsistency
about how task->tty is locked, and I'd not yet come to a conclusion.
On second thought, I really hope I'm imagining things here:
For instance, tty_open() does the following while not holding the
tasklist_lock for writing:
	if (IS_TTY_DEV(device)) {
		if (!current->tty)
			return -ENXIO;
		device = current->tty->device;
So tiocsctty() appears to have the following race against tty_open():
A                                       B
-----------------------------------------
tty->session > 0         if (!current->tty)
                           return -ENXIO; (test fails, don't return)
iterate tasklist,        delay...
  setting p->tty = NULL       current->tty is set to NULL
        (this looks like an attempt to obtain a unique
         reference by blowing away everyone else's)
task_lock(current)       device = current->tty->device
current->tty = tty       OOPS
task_unlock(task)
tiocsctty() holds the BKL (from sys_ioctl() itself) and the
tasklist_lock for reading, but tty_open() seems to hold only some
vfs references. release_dev() does the same style of iteration, but
doesn't even hold the BKL, only the tasklist_lock for reading. And
is very ominously called by tty_open() itself.
Also, most other accesses to tty->session and/or tty->pgrp seem to
be protected by the BKL.
