I've been hoping somebody would take this on.
Question: how will you carry the SMB token around? 
Let's imagine somebody starts a script that runs two programs 
that access SMB shares, and that they're initially not logged in at all.  
If this were Windows, it would prompt them once for their username 
and password, and then allow access from then on.
If you make the SMB token a property of the process, the 2nd program
won't be able to access the files after the 1st program somehow 
triggers the user to log in.
Perhaps it should be kept in the kernel in the process group,
so all processes in a process group can use the token?
