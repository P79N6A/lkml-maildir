No, you should only apply the last one (or rather the one you want).
patch-2.3.99-pre2 + pre3-3, then when you want to test pre3-4 you need to
undo the pre3-3 (like: gunzip < pre3-3.gz | patch -p0 -R) and then apply
pre3-4. Or keep a separate tree/tarball of the latest "baseline".

No(?), you have to go back to 2.3.99-pre2 before applying 2.3.99-pre3.
