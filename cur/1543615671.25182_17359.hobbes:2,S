Subject: no highmem with 2GB RAM?

I have a couple of SMP i386 boxes with 2GB RAM. They suffer from poor
performance due to block IO page bouncing with highmem enabled. I have
tried the block-highmem patch but this causes occasional oopses and even
panics under high IO load.
Will there be any ill effects if I change __PAGE_OFFSET to 0x7000000 or
thereabouts so that all RAM is mapped? 
I presume I only have to change this is page.h and vmlinux.lds.S as in 2.2
kernels.
