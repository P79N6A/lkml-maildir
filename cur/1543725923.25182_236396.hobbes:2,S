Agreed -- I guess what I am looking for is a regular way to link the 
instance of the object (if any) that caused the message, so it is easier 
to take action.
For a silly example, IDE, I want to know which hard drive had a read 
error; knowing that it came from drivers/ide/ide-disk.c is useful, but
quite limited; it doesn't tell me which drive I need to babysit and 
maybe swap. Certainly the message can print that information as part of
the text, but chances up we'll end up with something like printk again
if following that path.
Ok, I did my share of non-very-constructive criticism already--shutting up :)
