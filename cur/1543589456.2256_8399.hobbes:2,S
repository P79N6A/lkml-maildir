Thanks, at least that clears up some of the mystery.  Do you foresee any
problems with running on this setup using a kernel compiled for Athlon but
with the 3DNOW line commented out in arch/i386/config.in?  Should I go one
step further and force the use of generic mmx code in mmx.c?  (I suppose I
could just build for P2 or P3 to get the same effect.)
Thanks!
