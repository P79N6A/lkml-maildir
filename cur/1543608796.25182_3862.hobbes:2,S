No, we have (Americal National Standard X3.131-1986) "sequential-access",
"printer", "processor", etc., SCSI devices. They are controlled using a
"command-block", however they are not "block" devices although the 
sequential-access device could be (like tape). My tape is /dev/st0, it's
a character device.

    I was going to compile a list of innovations that could be
    attributed to Microsoft. Once I realized that Ctrl-Alt-Del
    was handled in the BIOS, I found that there aren't any.
