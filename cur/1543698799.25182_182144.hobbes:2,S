I tried it briefly, and it made no difference with the issue I am having.  
When disconnecting the gps receiver with a fd still open on it, it still 
gives an oops on closing it without the sysfs patch.  The sysfs patch 
eliminates the oops, but I wasn't getting an oops without your patch if I 
include the sysfs patch.  Anyway, I have over 200k of debugging output, so 
I'll send it to you off list.
Thanks,
