These numbers are misleading .. Doing a total code comparison shows that
a 2.6.14-rc2+ktimers kernel is slightly bigger than a vanilla 2.6.14-rc2
kernel (gcc 4.0, defconfig) .. So your argument that "small is faster"
must mean ktimers is slower, or at least not faster ..  
Making a speed argument based on code size doesn't make much sense to
me, if it's actually faster then show that it's faster.
