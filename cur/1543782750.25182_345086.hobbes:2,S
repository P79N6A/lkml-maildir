p4 clock modulation doesn't actually change the cpu frequency.

This is a support library used by the other speedstep libs.
(It's meant to be pulled in as a dependancy
rather than directly modprobed)
Your CPU isn't supported by the speedstep drivers, so loading
this is pointless.

support lib for p4-clockmod.
