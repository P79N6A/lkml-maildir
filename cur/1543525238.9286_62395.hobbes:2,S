Since upgrading my kernel (and pppd) to 2.3.40 I've been getting the
following messages in /var/log/messages.

I've done as much research as I can, and I still haven't found a solution.
Surely someone has come accross the same problem and knows the solution ?
Sorry to add to the traffic through this list, but I've tried all my other
options.
TIA
