The errors occur in strings of 0xFFs.  From the USB standard:
a “1” is represented by no change in level and a “0” is represented by a 
change in level
so this error-infested bytes are effectively long, quiet times on the 
wire.  I would have thought this would be the _least_ stressful time for 
the controllers but maybe they are also more susceptible to noise during 
this period.
