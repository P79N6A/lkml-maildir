Last time I saw the memory controller, it was 3000 lines.  Doesn't seem
too simple to me. :)
Can you post some of the additional controllers that you've been working
on to the appropriate mailing lists, like linux-mm?  If the subject
experts get a good look at the controllers, it's quite possible that
some comments will cascade back to the core, don't you think?
