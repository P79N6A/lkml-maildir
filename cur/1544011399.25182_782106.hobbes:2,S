You're not mistaken, this is not the original patch set, but a reduced
one (also by Jan), further reduced and cleaned up by me.
The original patch set implemented deep unioning of directory trees.
This one implements only unioning of the mount's top level directory.

I don't think such a layer is in the scope of this patch set.  It may
be a nice thing, but it will almost certainly be implemented in a
filesystem, not in the VFS.  Union mounts, as opposed to unionfs and
its ilk, are supposed to be very lightweight.
