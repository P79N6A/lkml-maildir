Well, first, the fact is that _some_ systems _will_ be powered while in
hibernation (the majority of notebooks, for example) and you should assume
that the platform _may_ retain some information accross the hibernation/restore
cycle.  In that case you _should_ _not_ trash the information retained by the
platform.
Now, with that in mind, ACPI requires us to make the system enter the S4 sleep
state as a result of the hibernation procedure.  In my opinion this may be done
after saving the image, but still this means, for example, that the
image-saving kernel needs to support ACPI.
Next, during the restore, we should first check if the image is present (and
valid) _without_ turning ACPI on (note that this is not done by the current
hibernation code and that leads to strange problems on some systems).  Then,
if the image is present (and valid), we should first load it, jump to the
hibernated kernel and _then_ turn ACPI on and execute the _BFS and
_WAK ACPI global methods (again, this is not done by the current code in that
order, which is wrong).  Only after that is the hibernated kernel supposed to
continue.
[Please refer to section 15.3 of the 3.0b ACPI spec for details.]
