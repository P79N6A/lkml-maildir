I found out the uhci-hcd causes the cpu to work at highest frequecy (according 
to x86info -mhz). If I unload it, cpu frequency dropps from full (1.8GHz) to 
~2/3 (1.1GHz). In both cases top shows 97% or even 99% idle.
1. Why causes uhci-hcd that high frequency at no obiously load?
2. Could this behaviour be stopped or do we have to live with it?
This is what I could find out. But I won't get further since I not a hacker, 
just a user.
Thanks anyway for all your work.
