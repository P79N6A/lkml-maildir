Hey Gang,
/* Warning: first posting every.. Nomex ON! =-) */
I am having similar problems with NFS, we've currently got a Digital Unix
4.0D NFS Server that houses most of our user data.  Our mail server mounts
the /home for imap connections, no matter what I do under 2.2.x it's only a
matter of time before I either get a kernel panic or under 2.2.11 it just
starts flipping out complaining about out of memory and I don't even have
luck getting a console on the machine.  I have to physically flip the reset
switch to get back on a console, if a console is up whenever you try to use
it it dumps out complaining about out of memory.  There are no logs or
problems that I can find so I'm pretty clueless about what the problem is.
I can run 2.0.x on the machine with the NFS mount with no problem so I'm
assuming (uh oh) that it is a 2.2.x related problem and that I only see the
problem when the machines starts to see some heavy traffic.
If anyone needs blow by blow hardware/software/anyware details please let me
know didn't want to pound it out since this is a known issue and appears to
be affecting most NFS 2.2.x clients.
I would like to experiment with some of the NFS patches that I've seen
mentioned in bit and pieces of the threads posted to the list and try to
help solve the problem, if anyone has any urls, documentation, or ideas
please let me know.
Thanks,
John Strange
