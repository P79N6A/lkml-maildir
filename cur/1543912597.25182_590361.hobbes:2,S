I'm not arguing to forbid the second case but confronting the sysadmin
there with nosharedcache is much less likely to harm existing setups than
the first case. Let's consider the most likely intention. The first case
is probably used as:
	mount -oro remote:/foo		<path>/foo
	mount -orw remote:/foo/a	<path>/foo/a
and I don't see a real issue with that, sharedcache or not. Ditto with:
	mount -oro remote:/foo/a	<path>/a
	mount -orw remote:/foo/b	<path>/b
These are all typical use cases, without multiple views on the same
tree. But
	mount -oro remote:/foo		/foo1
	mount -orw remote:/foo		/foo2
is strange and much less likely.
