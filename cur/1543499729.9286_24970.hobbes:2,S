There's still no problem with that. The only big problem
with the BSD license is that Microsoft isn't required to
give back their changes to the BSD community.
I don't see anything wrong with commercial companies using
Open Source stuff in their products -- as long as they give
something back to the community...
I propose we move the discussion to another forum and
continue there to talk about a new kind of license 
incorporating the best of GPL and BSD :)
