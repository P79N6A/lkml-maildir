Hi,
I have another drive which doesn't seem to be on any list, and a google search 
comes up with very little information about this one.
I have two raided SATA 1TB "MAXTOR STM31000333AS" drives, firmware MX15, one of 
which "failed" last weekend.  I have since rebuilt the array and it has had no 
further problems, but I know it's only a matter of time before it happens again.
I checked SMART, and both drives are essentially identical with nothing anywhere 
near failure.
I am on Ubuntu kernel 2.6.28-4-generic #5-Ubuntu but I will be happy to build a 
kernel if this becomes at all reproducible.
At first I thought that this NCQ problem might apply to me, but my drive is 
(gasp) one letter different from two of those listed (both seagate and maxtor 
variants):
http://seagate.custkb.com/seagate/crm/selfservice/search.jsp?DocId=207931
And MX15 is listed as a faulty firmware for the STM31000340AS/334AS
I have been using these drives for just three weeks up to now, before having the 
one drive fail (and later it gave a bunch of errors at bootup, which was solved 
when it reset the SATA link). The other drive has luckily not had any issues.
Is this error just coincidence, or did Seagate forget to mention my drive?
(And what happened to the firmware updates--they seem to be "In Validation")
Is seagate the only site with information about this? Any public blacklist of 
every affected drive? What can I see in dmesg that indicates that NCQ is the cause?
Thanks,
-Patrick
(I'll paste my dmesg as I don't know enough to tell if this is the same issue as 
the other seagate drives--I trimmed the repetitive parts)
