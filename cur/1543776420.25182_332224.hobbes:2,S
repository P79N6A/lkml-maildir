If I just wanted hooks, I would have submitted a patch that did just
that, without any logging function. The code for the mux that goes
on top of that code is actually on its way to be completely rewritten.
I can see that you may have read my posting as indicating that we were
recompiling the same previous code out of tree, but that is certainly
not the intent.
FWIW, we'll look submitting a minimal mux with the patch.
