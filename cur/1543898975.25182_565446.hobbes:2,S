OK, that seems inconsistent with what you said before.  You said that 
T __attribute__((foo)) *v;
gives you a foo-pointer-to-T.  So shouldn't
int __attribute__((noderef)) *v;
give you a noderef-pointer-to-int?

OK, that makes sense; address_space describes the actual storage of the
thing pointed to, not the pointer.  It *could* describe the pointer, if
you had a pointer that resided in user address space, but that occurs
less often, and would use a different syntax.
However, noderef seems like a property of a pointer, hence why I
proposed the example I did.  A warning should occur when you do
*(<noderef T *>v) to get a T, not when you do *(<* noderef T>v) to get a
noderef T.
