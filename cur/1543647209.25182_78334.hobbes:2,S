If you compiled it static (e.g. pass -static to gcc), then the
dynamic-linker shouldn't be referenced in the executable. The kernel
doesn't assume that elf requires ld.so.1, that's something that is
placed into the executable itself as the INTERP. If you have an INTERP
section in your test executable, you didn't link it properly. There
should be no references to NEEDED and INTERP when you do:
# coldfirev4e-elf-objdump -x hello | less
