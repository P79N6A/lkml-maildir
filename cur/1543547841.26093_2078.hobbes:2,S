I think that this would be a good idea for one reason.  It lets folks
of lesser skill (open developent.. army of testers) capture quality
data for our tiny group of core developers.  If you have any code
reading skill at all, on oops for example, you _can_ take a peek and
report values instead of only 'it croaked!'.  You can fight your way
closer to problem causes and try to save some valuable guru time.

Ah.  I find it _damned_ hard to debug the kernel with or without a
kernel debugger ;-)
