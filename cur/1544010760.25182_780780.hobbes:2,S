If necessary, that would be useful. However, the first question to ask is
actually
related to my possibility C) - which I'm now re-evaluating as much more
likely.
If you don't load the 'rfkill-input' module, then there is no policy
applied to
killswitch handling. The core driver puts the device in the SOFT_BLOCKED
state
when the de-assert the hardware switch. rfkill-input contains the policy
that
decides to go one step further and re-enable the device. This module has no
hardware dependencies so it is not automatically loaded - you must do it
explicitly yourself.
If that's not your problem, then we'll have to dig deeper.
