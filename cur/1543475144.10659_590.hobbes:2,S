Hmm.. The old dentry for dir should not just be dropped, it should be
released. Now why doesn't that happen? That sounds like the source of the
problem (technically just dropping the dentry is correct from a dentry
coherency point of view, but leaving an unreferenced and unhashed dentry
around is just a waste of resources and leads to these kinds of secondary
issues).
