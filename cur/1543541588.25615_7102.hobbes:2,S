This is not quite correct wrt. Mac. (And I think in a rather important way  
for this discussion.)
You see, the Mac *does* support handling the resource fork as a stream  
(fully generic, with lseek() and everything). (The Resource Manager is, in  
effect, a user space library sitting on top of this model.)
You just need a different open() function. (Well, there are a number of  
quirks here, too, but I won't go into them.)
Another thing of note is that the Resource Manager namespace is actually  
structured.
Every resource has a type (4 characters), a number (16 bits IIRC), and a  
name; the (type, number) tuple must be unique, I don't recall if (type,  
name) must also be unique. And the accessor routines essentially handle  
the type as if it were a directory.
Who said that subdirectories in meta data don't make sense?

In MacOS, you have the stream, and the Resource Manager data structure on  
top of that, and you can deal with interesting stuff like when to do  
garbage collection on the whole mess. Oh, and modern versions can do some  
sort of compression on resources, but *not* via Resource Manager routines  
- you need a program accessing the raw stream to do that. The RM can only  
decompress.
