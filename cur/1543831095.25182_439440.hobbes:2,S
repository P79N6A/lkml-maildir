drivers/ide is on its way out. I'm also curious that this shows up given
that the inw() is going to cause a PCI sequence and stall the CPU
entirely for ages anyway.
NAK because
1. This is a gcc problem
2. Not everyone is using an intel x86-32 box which has such problems
3. IDE is in life-support mode and the relatives are already planning
the flowers.
