True. 
Why not turn it into a kernel flag that you can set at bootup through LILO or 
some other obscure boot manager? Then you could boot linux like this:
linux dmesg=verbose
and
linux dmesg=quiet
with any of the two being the default setting. This way you can have the cake 
and eat it too: the verbose setting for those that want it, and the quiet 
setting for the users that don't want to get scared sh*tless everytime their 
system boots. I know I got scared first time I booted a Linux box :P
