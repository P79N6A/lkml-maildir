That's pretty much exactly what happens. The kernel caches inodes and
dentries when memory usage allows. When the last reference to an inode
is dropped and the file system is still in use, the inode goes on the
unused_inode list. It remains linked to the inode hash table. When a
inode is requested, the hash table is checked before trying to read it
back from disk. Check out generic_forget_inode() and ifind().
When there is memory pressure, the VM system will shrink these caches.
inode_init() registers a callback for the VM to call
shrink_icache_memory () which will finally free the memory. Check out
mm/vmscan.c and fs/inode.c for more detailed information.
