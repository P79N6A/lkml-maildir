Hi All,
I have a bunch of computers with 8139 cards. When I moved the cables
over from my hub to my new switch all the "full duplex" lights came on
immediately.
Would this mean that the driver/card already were in full-duplex? That
would explain me seeing way too many collisions on that old hub (which
obviously doesn't support full-duplex).
(Some machines run 2.2 kernels, others run 2.4 kernels some run the
old driver, others run the 8139too driver). 
				Roger.
