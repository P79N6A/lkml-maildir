They are structured differently but end up doing very nearly the same
thing.  Chris and I have had exactly the same problems to solve and a
lot of the solutions are similar.  
However, right now neither codebase can deal with VM memory pressure
well, because the VM simply doesn't export a mechanism by which a
filesystem can react to that right now.
