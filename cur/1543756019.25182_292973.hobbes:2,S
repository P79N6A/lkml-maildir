  I resent the patches and the same thing happened.  I digged the 
problem and found out that my script was faulty.  The reason was that 
the mail program didn't handle commas appropriately in to-addr list. 
Bartlomiej, I sincerely apologize for polluting your mailbox yet again. 
  Please forgive me, it won't happen again (really!). :-)
  I'll repost the patches in another thread.  Sorry again about the mess.
