when trying to suspend (either by directly echoing > /proc/swsusp/activate,
or with the script) It only gets as far as the first screen "killing
processes/freeing space" (can't remember the exact message despite
staring at it for a good 20 mins total today)
the 'r' and 'l' keys both change the message, toggling reboot and
logging respectively, but no other keys have any effect.
