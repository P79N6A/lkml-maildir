No. I hope you realize now that it was a mistake to define
kernel-related things without waiting for the kernel implementation.
Many glibc data types are:
1. incompatible with the old kernel API
2. unsuitable as a new kernel API
I hope you have learned to wait for the kernel developers.
Hopefully you have a non-bloat-inducing way to fix this error.
(there are several filesystems that need 64 bits or would work
better with 64 bits: UDF, Reiserfs, NTFS, XFS, NFS)
