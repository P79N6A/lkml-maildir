I implemented them some time ago for log writes in XFS. Not for fsync though,
although fsync usually does a log write afterwards so it should work
in practice too. fdatasync might not.
Don't know if the code hasn't bit rotted away and it also was a bit
dumb. It was definitely there at some point.
But then a lot of ATA disks and SCSI don't support barriers. Or at least
the IDE barrier tests fails on several of my machines.
