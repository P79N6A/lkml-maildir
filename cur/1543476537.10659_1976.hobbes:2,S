So to write optimal C++ I have to know at least as much as the internal 
structure of the code than for C. Thats the point I was trying to get across
C++ is less efficient because the compiler cannot perform some optimisations it
can in C without help from the code writer.
Its exactly those kind of things that make C++ uninteresting for serious
performance sensitive and large projects. Poor language design - not poor
concepts - Linux is object oriented - but in C for example.
