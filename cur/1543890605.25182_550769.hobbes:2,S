You don't need to dissect the header manually to look for that bit.   
If you feed inflate() at least the first two bytes, it will return  
immediately with the Z_NEED_DICT return code if a preset dictionary  
is requested.  You can force inflate() to return immediately after  
decoding the two byte header even if a preset dictionary is not  
requested by using the Z_BLOCK flush code.
