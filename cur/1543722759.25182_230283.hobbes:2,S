Yes -- it looked to me like the semantics would be more correct, since
currently, "if (shm_tot + numpages >= shm_ctlall)" will break when
shm_tot wraps around MAX_INT and becomes negative.

The SHM_INFO shmctl is actually how I found it in the first place.
But we have the same situation with many other values.  For example,
shm_ctlmax, shm_ctlall and shm_segsz can all potentially be 64-bit wide
in the kernel and are exported into potentially 32-bit userspace values.
We don't return -1 for any of those if they don't fit.  Is there a
special reason to do it in this case?
