grub that came with RH 8.0 can boot 2.5.50 with no problems.
- what is the filesystem on /dev/hda3 ?
- do you have the FS *compiled into the kernel* ?
- did you rebuild your initrd?
Otherwise your old initrd will have old modules, and the FS module won't
load into your new kernel. If you compile them *into* the 2.5.50 then it
will just complain. That's what I did.
