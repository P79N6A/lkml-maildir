Here's an idea which might just be too simple, but here it is anyway:
Modifiy the bk snapshot scripts to name the 2.6.x series snapshots as -PREy
instead of -BKy.  That way, the general population of users will see
the -bk snapshots as -pre releases.  According to Linus, pre == bk.  So,
name them as such.
Linus, wait for at least two weeks before releasing the first -rc.
That way, the bulk on the thundering herd of patches will be hopefully
be merged by then.  And users will have 2.6.x-PRE[1..14] to test.
The hard part for the kernel.org script writer might be to disable
the -bk/-pre snapshot once the first -rc is out.
Since your _intent_ is that an -rc really be an -rc, make it so.  It
shouldn't take more than a release or two to train the maintainers
that the post-2.6.11 -rc's are _really_ release candidates.
