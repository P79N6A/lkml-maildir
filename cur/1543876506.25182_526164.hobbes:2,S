I can count about 6 over the past month.

I have them in an rrd file. I think though that the numbers will be
'adjusted' to fit in with the timekeeping. The logging code I've added
should provide exact numbers as it'll just dump what it reads from /proc
into syslog.

Correct. The environment is 64bit clean, though the kernel is compiled
with 32bit support so that I can run static 32bit binaries if need be.

If you want I can toss you the rrd graphs that result from the data. The
values do not appear to be static. For example, the resent 2 hits
(within 10 minutes of each other) gave almost 3petabytes and just over 4
petabytes. Interesting is that the incoming data is driven upto
petabytes whilst the outgoing data hits megabytes at that point. This is
consistant and the server is generally quiet.
