Hmm. No, I don't think that should be a problem. free_initmem() only 
happens at the very, after do_basic_setup() has been run, which includes 
all the initcall stuff.
However, it's an interesting observation. How sure are you that it's this 
commit that triggers it. You say "This seems to be what's triggering ..", 
I'm wondering how firm that is..
