Thanks - yes, I see (I tend to get lost in my testruns).  So we're back to
trying to do the fix I was trying to do along with the SIGCONT fix a few
weeks ago.
The problem is that when you run a setuid binary, its pP and pE are
fully raised.  The following patch fixes it for me.  Chris, does it fix
your problem?  Andrew, am I again confusing myself and doing something
unsafe?
thanks,

Subject: [PATCH 1/1] file capabilities: don't prevent signaling setuid root programs.
When an unprivileged user runs a setuid root program in !SECURE_NOROOT
mode, fP, fI, and fE are set full on, so pP' and pE' are full on.
Then cap_task_kill() prevents the user from signaling the setuid root
task.  This is a change in behavior compared to when
!CONFIG_SECURITY_FILE_CAPABILITIES.
This patch introduces a special check into cap_task_kill() just
to check whether a non-root user is signaling a setuid root
program started by the same user.  If so, then signal is allowed.
This still leaves open the question of whether we want to go back
to allowing users to signal binaries owned by them which had
file capabilities set.
