Another one?  There's already been significant work in that area.  See for
example
  http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=117000652529003&w=2
Which admittedly didn't behave when I just put it onto my test rig,
but seems nonetheless to be a significant step forward.  It's not like
everyone has hardware that can use such a driver after all!

Example, one usually wants card detect to be an IRQ, to avoid polling...

That's how it's done in that patch.  The model being what the PXA MMC/SD
card driver does, since that's the most generic model I found ... handling
for example systems which need to poll for card detect, as well as ones
that can use real gpio based IRQs.  The mmc_spi driver doesn't need to know
which kind of platform it's got.
