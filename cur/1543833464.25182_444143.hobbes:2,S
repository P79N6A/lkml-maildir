Subject: [test patch] seccomp: add code to disable TSC when enabling  seccomp

Is the below patch acceptable in generic code, or should some arch
helper function hide it?  It lets i386 / x86_64 add TIF_NOTSC
independently.  
Also, what prevents this flag from being set on a running process?
If that happens the CPU state and flag could get out of sync and
this could cause problems because of the way the current code tests
the flag.
