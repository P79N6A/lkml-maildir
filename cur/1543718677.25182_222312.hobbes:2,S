Quite frankly, a number of us are hoping that we can make them
unnecessary. The cost of the 4g/4g split is absolutely _huge_ on some
things, including basic stuff like kernel compiles.
The only valid reason for the 4g split is that the VM doesn't always 
behave well with huge amounts of highmem. The anonvma stuff in 2.6.7-pre1 
is hoped to make that much less of an issue.
Personally, if we never need to merge 4g for real, I'll be really really 
happy. I see it as a huge ugly hack.
