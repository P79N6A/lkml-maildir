   Hi!
   NeTraMet v44b10 uses pcap(3) and complains about timestamps jumping 
   backwards.  Looks like a PF_PACKET socket doesn't receive the packets 
   in the correct order.  Some timestamps from a "tcpdump -tt":
      RX:  1001465480.175100 [...] 
      TX:  1001465480.179111 [...] 
      RX:  1001465480.177315 [...] 
                      ^^^^^^
      TX:  1001465480.180514 [...]
      RX:  1001465480.179706 [...]
The receive packets are in order, as are the transmit packets.
Anything which absolutely _requires_ all TX and RX packets to
be in precise order, should really be fixed not to have such
a weird restriction.
Franks a lot,
