Thanks a lot. I'm going through these patches and will get back to you
in case of any problem.
I have a SATA Controller that is attached to HSX bus on ARM based
chipset. On this side, I'm exploring the feasibilty of coming up with
low-level libata-SATA driver (as libata is being said to support
generic bus interface). I've gone through the SATA drivers in kernel
code but all seem to be PCI specific.
Also, Is there any slight possiblity of doing the same with 2.4.x
kernels (by patching the kernel or whatever)?
Any suggestion/comments/advice will be of great help.
Thanks in advance.
