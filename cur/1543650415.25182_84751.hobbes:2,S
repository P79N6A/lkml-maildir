Hello All,
I have worked on PCI-Device driver on Linux 2.4.18-3 (i386), at presently i
am working on a T1/E1 device driver development.
The following are the questions i have:
 How one n/w layer will interact with other n/w layer ( driver)
	e.g. in my case T1/E1 driver will interface with Lapd, i have found skbuffs
utilization for
	doing the same. I am not clear on the same?. How skbuffs can be used. ( if
possible please provide/suggest me with a piece of
	demo code which can be handy to understand "skbuffs" concepts.
 Can i have any other interface for applications other then sockets?
 Can any one suggest me any documents/articles to read, i have Rubini's
"Linux Device Drivers".
-Thanks in advance.
Hari
