previously discussed patches for sysrq.c and boosect.S applied and
allowed a good compile.
I get the following warnings for make dep:
/usr/src/linux-2.3.21mod/Rules.make:267: target `uart401.o' given more
than once in the same rule.
/usr/src/linux-2.3.21mod/Rules.make:263: target `uart401.o' given more
than once in the same rule.
newport.c:11: asm/gfx.h: No such file or directory
newport.c:12: asm/ng1.h: No such file or directory
newport.c:14: asm/newport.h: No such file or directory
config.c:430: #error "HiSax: No cards configured"
tcsyms.c:7: asm/dec/tc.h: No such file or directory
I also get the following warnings for make bzImage:
/usr/src/linux-2.3.21mod/Rules.make:263: target `uart401.o' given more
than once in the same rule.
/usr/src/linux-2.3.21mod/Rules.make:263: target `uart401.o' given more
than once in the same rule.
fault.c: In function `do_page_fault':
fault.c:115: warning: `sem' might be used uninitialized in this function
I get the following for make modules:
/usr/src/linux-2.3.21mod/Rules.make:263: target `uart401.o' given more
than once in the same rule.
sr.c: In function `get_sectorsize':
sr.c:864: warning: unused variable `flags'
sr.c: In function `sr_packet':
sr.c:1034: warning: unused variable `flags'
After booting up in 2.3.21 I get an error for unresolved symbol
init_task_union when inserting scsi_mod.o.
The uart401.o message is caused by building sound support for both
soundblaster and pas16.  It can be eliminated by and ifdef in the
Makefile.  That's an ugly hack so it was rejected.
config attached in case I've done something stupid.
