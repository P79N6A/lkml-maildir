firstly, thanks for the review feedback!
originally i tested this feature with some minimal amount of RAM 
simulated by UML 128MB or so. That's just 32 thousand pages, but still 
the improvement was massive: context-switch times in UML were cut in 
half or more. Process-creation times improved 10-fold. With this feature 
included I accidentally (for the first time ever!) confused an UML shell 
prompt with a real shell prompt. (before that UML was so slow [even in 
"skas mode"] that you'd immediately notice it by the shell's behavior)
the 'have 1 vma instead of 32,000 vmas' thing is a really, really big 
plus. It makes UML comparable to Xen, in rough terms of basic VM design.
Now imagine a somewhat larger setup - 16 GB RAM UML instance with 4 
million vmas per UML process ... Frankly, without 
sys_remap_file_pages_prot() the UML design is still somewhat of a toy.
