It's harder than you think. If hundreds of developpers work on a version
without thinking a second about separating security fixes and new features,
you'll have a hard time extracting them all ! But generally (I said generally),
security fixes are separated because noone knows from the start if a fix will
be the best one, so they need to be able to revert it easily. More common
problems involve changes to the core to support new features, or to satisfy
some developper's own idea of what is good and what is bad.

Anyway, when you manage your own distribution, you have no other solution
than reading lkml daily (better: continuously) to grab the required fixes
and apply them to your local tree. If you feel that sometime you won't be
able to do the backport, either you can ask on lkml, people are often willing
to help, or you need to rely on other people's work (read distro kernels).

Not only proprietary software. I nearly don't use any (vmware a few times a
year). Viro would tell you that the problem is on the editor's side. I have
often been annoyed by opensource patches breakage. Try to use the same PaX
patch for 4 months, for example, without getting rejects nor wrongly applied
chunks !
Another problem is when code organisation changes. For example, in 2.4.29pre3,
some xfs files have moved, which break the 2.4.28 vserver patch. Fixing it was
not difficult, but it's just an example of things which could be avoided in a
stable tree (and I'm sure that Christoph will flame me for saying this).

Once again, my personal concern is about opensource code not being always
possible to apply without lots of efforts. This problem is very old, it
recently cost many efforts to several people to try to replace IDE code
in 2.6. In general, it's diffcult to work aside of the kernel and follow
it closely, whether you're opensource or not.

Well, it will be simpler when vmware authors will be fed up too and switch
to another OS (I'm not talking about the one which you cannot use in console
mode), you'll just have to follow them :-)
