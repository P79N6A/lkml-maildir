This is pretty sure fixed in 2.6.25-rc5.
It's probably this:
https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=350017
It's fixed by:
c8d16e27a3601d1cbcdfe657eb4ff5e762019e8d
-> fixing the memory corruption
b6a163875935ce8e8e85901a7f2b68f7a314d914
-> check the pointer which is now not corrupted anymore, but NULL.
Hmm, the commits are only in Len's tree and have not hit
Linus' tree yet.
