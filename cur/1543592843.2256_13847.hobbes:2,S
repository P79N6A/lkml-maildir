Unfortunately Intel removed the local APIC from their Mobile P6 range,
so you won't be able to use the NMI watchdog on your Omnibook.
This is actually documented (for the Mobile PII at least) in some
obscure place, probably in the spec update.
Oh, and remove IO_APIC support too. Your machine doesn't have one.
