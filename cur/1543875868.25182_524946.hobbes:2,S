  Sure! I wrote it's nothing really new. And I hope it's clear why
those macros appeared in the first place: with the type of structures
the device virtual methods are intended to be used, there're always
pretty comprehensive member selection and typecasting is required. In
this regard, there were 3 choices:
1. Use long but explicit expressions, like
((struct dev_pdata*)pdev.dev->platform_device)->x_ops->func(dev)
2. Use temporary variables:
struct dev_pdata *tmp = (struct dev_pdata*)pdev.dev->platform_device;
tmp->x_ops->func(dev);
3. Introduce macros which would hide guts and would provide syntax
more resembling usual function call (especially for folks who remember
that preprocessor is unalienable part of C ;-) ).
     As I also noted in the original mail, macros are also nice device
for in-place annotation - to emphasize the fact that this is not just
a mundane case of pointer manipulation, but paradigmatic thing.
     By this criteria I happened to choose macros syntax. But it's still
merely a syntax, and I don't pledge for it. If there's more movement
towards using explicit low-level forms like 1) or 2) instead of
introducing new syntactic pattern, then macro syntax can be considered
to have fulfilled its introductory role and can be dropped.
