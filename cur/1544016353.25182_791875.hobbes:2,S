Doesn't this reduce performance again? I thought the whole
point of splice() was to increase performance by avoiding
memory copies. If I have to do a poll syscall for each call
to splice, doesn't the context switch eat that performance
advantage again?
Or was splice designed only for multi-threaded applications
(which at least Samba is not)?
