Well, to start, become root and execute `modprobe -c >junk`.
The file, junk, now contains everything modprobe 'knows' about.
You can use this as a reference.
Let's say that you have a new device, a character device with
a major number of 177. You want a module to be automatically
loaded upon the first access to that device. You simply insert
the following lines in /etc/modules.conf.
path[my-module]=/complete/path/to/where/you/put/it
alias char-major-177 my-module
Normally, you keep all the paths together and the aliases
sorted to make sense to humans. The software doesn't care.
Also, "my-module" is the module file-name without the ".o"
You only need paths if the module is not in a standard
place like 'lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel. The file
/lib/modules/`uname -r`/modules.dep, contains all the
dependency information for everything, generated with
the `depmod -a` command.
Maybe somebody has a script that configures this auto-magically,
however I've never seen it and haven't had to use it. Problems
with finding modules with new kernel versions usually are the
result of a change in the directory structure under
/lib/modules/`uname -r`/ so you might want to make several
/etc/modules.conf files if you boot several widely-different
kernel versions. Just fix up the paths where required.
Cheers,
