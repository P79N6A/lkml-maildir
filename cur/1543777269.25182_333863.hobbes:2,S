The patch has: 
+ALLSOURCE_ARCHS := $(ARCH)
won't that do it? I thought $(ARCH) would be i386 so ALLSOURCE_ARCHS
will be too unless you override it.
I thought I'd tested non-ALLSOURCE_ARCHS but it was quite a while back
so I can't say for sure... I'll have a look when I get to work tomorrow
though.
