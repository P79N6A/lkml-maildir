It's not about the copyright.  I like the string kept in the object 
code so that I and others can find out where the code is used and what 
version is in use.  This in fact turned out to be useful when a 
security vulnerability was found in versions 1.1.3 and earlier and a 
script could search for executables with the offending code.
