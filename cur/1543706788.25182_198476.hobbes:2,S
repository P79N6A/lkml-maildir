I don't believe there's any code which needs fixing in userspace.  We just
need modprobe.conf to do the right thing when we convert peoples old
modules.conf files.
The original modprobe defaults to:
alias net-pf-10 off
unless net-pf-10 is explicitly aliased to something else (ipv6).  We
therefore just need peoples modprobe.conf files to contain:
install net-pf-10 /bin/true
provided they haven't aliased net-pf-10 to ipv6.
