Subject: Re: [PATCH] add boot option to control Intel combined mode behavior (to allow DMA in combined mode configs!)

Just FYI, I tested this new patch (the one that changes the option from 
intel_combined_mode= to combined_mode=) and it works great.  Please 
push it upstream after 2.6.15 comes out; I think lots of people will 
benefit from being able to turn on DMA.
Thanks,
Jesse
