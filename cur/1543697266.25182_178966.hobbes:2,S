It also does this after suspend-to-disk (either flavor), which is reported
in Bugzilla:
	
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1373
It's probably worthwhile adding that it fails similarly with ACPI S3 (in
addition to S4 as already reported).
    Oh! Good! I'm also trying to get this fixed, but I haven't seen any
    progress on this issue (if my memory serves me well, Greg hadn't access
    to a system with UHCI-HCD host controller to test).
Please, PLEASE, if you think you have a patch and you would like a report
on, send it to me and i'll at least try running it [after Friday], perhaps
even try to debug it.  Thank you for your efforts!
