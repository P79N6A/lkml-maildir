Anyone who uses lk-changelog.pl or shortlog
(YES THIS COMPRISES YOU, MARCELO ;-) 
with these option combinations:
- --mode=terse AND NOT --noobfuscate
- --mode=oneline AND NOT --noobfuscate
please be aware that address obfuscation of unknown addresses does not
work (I'll consider that an information leak given that addresses and
logs are web accessible through archives and are actually harvested by
those saboteurs that call themselves direct advertisers), so you may get
lines like:
  o example change log entry (user@example.org)
Rather than
  o example change log entry (user:example.org)
The issue was fixed in 0.166; 0.167 is the latest release version.
Get it from:
BK:  bk://129.217.163.1   (NO trailing slash, bkd -xcd there!)
Once Linus pulls these changes, it will also become available at the
official repository: bk://kernel.bkbits.net/torvalds/tools/
WWW: 
http://mandree.home.pages.de/linux/kernel/
this site carries releases and GnuPG signatures
(Yes, the GPG signing key has changed recently,
the days of PGP 2.x are passing...)
