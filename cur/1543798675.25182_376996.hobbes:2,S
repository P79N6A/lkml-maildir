That only works if unshare() should always mean "unshare everything
except specified things", including things that we currently don't
unshare.
I guess that is probably fine.  Anything that would break
unshare()-using programs in future if it unshared by default, would be
likely to break clone()-using programs too.  Is that right?  Any
counterexamples?
