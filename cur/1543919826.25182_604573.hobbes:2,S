The fact it has nothing to do with Linux Kernel, not even remotely as
the patent is never, no matter how wide you stretch it, is going to
cower any technology in the kernel, makes this a FUD post, since the
poster didn't bother to explain it.
It's still unclear what the patent actually mean, might be multi
monitor, virtual desktop or maybe sticky windows. Only thing clear is
that it can't be the Linux Kernel it's about.
