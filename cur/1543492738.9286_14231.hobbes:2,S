Hi,
As I understand from the sources all the packets that enter the Linux
box from all the network devices are tagged on to a single input backlog
queue (Pls correct me if I am wrong)...Has anybody done any testing to
see what size the queue grows in times of heavy traffic on decently fast
machine(like the specs above)..
If I have Linux configured as a router(single processor Pentium 350, 128
MB) and attach four 10 MB PCI Network interfaces to it.. 
If I now set up traffic patterns such that interfaces 1 and 2 recv heavy
traffic from the network and interfaces 3 and 4 then throw out the
packets back onto the network after the routing..what would be the
status of the network backlog queue..??? How large would it grow to ..??
Is there anyway we can setup different queues for different devices..??
I can think of a simple way way in netif_rx() we can look at skb->dev
and based on that put the packets in a different queues..anybody see any
potential problems..??
Thanks,
Arni
