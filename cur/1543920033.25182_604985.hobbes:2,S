Sounds good for me. Will correct it.

Yes, I would like it to be merged... But not just to see my name in
the kernel sources.
I'm the only one user of this hardware under 2.4 because it's some
kind of trick to make it work under 2.4 w/o its support in the kernel.
We moved to the other hardware because of our reasons and some
customers can move to the other OS where this hardware will be
supported.
I'm sure that we're not the first who tried to make it work in 2.4.
Original driver was created for 2.5 and > because interrupt out urbs
were not supported in 2.4. Now it's not an issue.

I'm not going to force you to do this, also I can't do this:). But
after going through the recent news where Greg proposed to create
drivers for companies for free it looks really reasonable. I
understand that we are talking about 2.4 but if you will simply run
diff for adutux of 2.4 and 2.6 you will see that changes are really
trivial.
Also IMHO the more drivers are in the tree the more users will use it.
Once it will be merged in the mainline then it will be backported to
enterprise kernels and would gain wide usage.
Best,
Vitaliy
