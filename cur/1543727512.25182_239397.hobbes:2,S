Some of the 2.4 semantics just don't make sense. I would not find it
difficult to explain what I believe correct semantics to be in a written
document.
The largest barrier is that the accounting has a large code impact.

It will likely be easier to merge improvements of /proc/$PID/status as
the operations there are far less frequent and the accounting less
invasive.
