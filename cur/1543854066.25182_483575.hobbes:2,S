FYI: trying with just the first patch didn't work. I got
the usual:
irq 185: nobody cared (try booting with the "irqpoll" option)
 <c013e19a> __report_bad_irq+0x2a/0xa0  <c013d970> handle_IRQ_event
+0x30/0x70
 <c013e2b0> note_interrupt+0x80/0xf0  <c013da8c> __do_IRQ+0xdc/0xf0
 <c0105799> do_IRQ+0x19/0x30  <c010391a> common_interrupt+0x1a/0x20
 <c0100d91> default_idle+0x41/0x70  <c0100e60> cpu_idle+0x80/0x90
handlers:
[<c0301300>] (qs_intr+0x0/0x230)
Disabling IRQ #185
Interestingly enough this is the first time I see it outside
of irq 193, not that it matter though.
I am going to try now with the second patch instead.
