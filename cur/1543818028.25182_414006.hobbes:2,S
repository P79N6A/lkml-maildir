You and Dmitry are correct.  I'm dropping this patch.  The ISA drivers
just need to get used to the proper way to use the driver model (they do
not know if they have been bound to a device when the driver is loaded,
no big deal).
If there's other issues with platform devices still, without this patch
applied, please let me know.
thanks to you all for pointing out the real issues here.
