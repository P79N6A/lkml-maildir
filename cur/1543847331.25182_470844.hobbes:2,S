Any half-sensible greylisting implementation would be exempting
vger.kernel.org as soon as it's observed to retry its _first_ mail,
anyway.
Greylisting done _stupidly_, where it keeps delaying mail from a given
host even after it's known to queue and retry, would be a problem. But
done sensibly it's fine.
