I think that, with a single instance of `rm`, not as written above,
this would complete because all the open runtime libraries would
remain mem-mapped until the last close. So, I think you could
remove everything with -rf except the programs that will return
'text file busy' errors because they are open for execution.
An, no. I am not going to try it! Well maybe sometime when I
mount an alternate root that I am going to replace.
