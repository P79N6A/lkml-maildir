Currently, I think zone->nr_mem_map itself is very vague.
I'm now looking for another way to remove this part entirely.
I think mem_section approarch may be helpful to remove this part,
but to implement full feature of CONFIG_NONLINEAR,
I'll need lots of different kind of patches.
(If mem_map is guaranteed to be contiguous in one mem_section)
1. Now, I think some small parts, some essence of mem_section which
   makes pfn_valid() faster may be good.
And another way,
2. A method which enables page -> page's max_order calculation
   may be good and consistent way in this no-bitmap approach.
But this problem would be my week-end homework :).
