The code isn't merged yet.  I sent a version to lkml for review -- in
fact it was this very thread that we're in now.  The code in question
is in 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2005/4/4/266
This implements a "userspace verbs" character device that memory
registration goes through.  This means the kernel has a device node
that will be closed when a process dies, and so the memory can be
cleaned up.
