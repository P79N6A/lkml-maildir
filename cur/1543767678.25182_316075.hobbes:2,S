Subject: [RFC][PATCH] update SubmittingPatches to clarify attachment policy
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/5/4/83

I think the general opinion of posting patches as attachments
has changed over the last few years.  Mailers have been getting
a lot better at handling them, even quoting non-message-body
plain/text attachments in replies.  
Plus, a plain/text attachment message saved to a file can go
into 'patch' the same way that an inline one can.

 Linus and other kernel developers need to be able to read and comment
 on the changes you are submitting.  It is important for a kernel
 developer to be able to "quote" your changes, using standard e-mail
 tools, so that they may comment on specific portions of your code.
 
-For this reason, all patches should be submitting e-mail "inline".
+For this reason, the preferred way of submitting patches in e-mail is
+"inline", in the same part of the message with everything else.
 WARNING:  Be wary of your editor's word-wrap corrupting your patch,
 if you choose to cut-n-paste your patch.
 
+Many maintainers will now accept patches submitted to them as
+text/plain attachments.  Many mailers quote these attachements in the
+same way that they do for inline patches.  But, some maintainers still
+prefer inlines and they are certainly the safest bet.  In any case,
+never attach more than one patch to a single e-mail.

 Do not attach the patch as a MIME attachment, compressed or not.
 Many popular e-mail applications will not always transmit a MIME
 attachment as plain text, making it impossible to comment on your
