Lets see the equation of the current situation. On one side you want 
static tracing but you dont want to implement kprobes on m68k - although 
you probably could. On the other side there is the main kernel, which, 
if it ever accepted static tracepoints, could probably never get rid of 
them.
so, you request the main kernel to accept hundreds of static tracepoints 
that would probably never go away, just because you are reluctant at the 
moment to implement kprobes? And that only to bridge a temporary period 
of time when m68k has no kprobes support yet? Combined with the fact 
that m68k was just fine without tracing for 13 years? Did i get that 
right?
