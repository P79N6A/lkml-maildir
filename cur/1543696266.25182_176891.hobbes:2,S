So tested further: I patched the very last byts of the image and these 
are my findings:
In DAO mode, the complete image is actually written, but the writer is 
not able to read it out! The last 4096 bytes are not read. I put the 
CD-RW into my DVD-ROM, and it reads it out completely.
So: Is cdrecord/cdrdao making something wrong (yes, I know I can use 
-pad, but I want an *identical copy*) or has the kernel ATAPI reading 
routine a bug? (Or has my drive a bug???? Well, I need to read the disc 
out in windows I guess...)
