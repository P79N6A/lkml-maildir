Yes, this is called having 2 bus masters, which are the chips that
can use the bus to read and write to memory. What can be done is to
timeshare the bus, for example the cpu accesses memory on odd cycles
and the dma chip does on even cycles.
A more complex design would allow the cpu to access memory on all
cycles, but give the dma chip more priority. This would mean that
a dma transfer would take priority over the cpu. Think about
a sound card reading the sound data to pump it to the speakers,
you would prefer not to have it skip.
Greets, Antonio.
