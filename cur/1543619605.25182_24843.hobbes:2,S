No. I can reproduce with ext2 root & reiserfs mounted separately.
depmod -a -b /mnt causes a crash for me 100% of time.
(of course you need correct /lib/modules/... for that)

I dug the original message,
it's subject is "DO NOT USE IT (Re: linux-2.5.3-pre1 and IDE Driver Trouble) FATAL"
msgid is <Pine.LNX.4.10.10201161259270.29434-100000@master.linux-ide.org>
It warns about 2.5.3-pre1 and 2.5.2 is unstable with IDE because there are
conflicts between BIO & ACB. He promised to come up with the fix later.
After that there were no messages from him with patches.
At least not in the lkml.
Bye,
    Oleg
