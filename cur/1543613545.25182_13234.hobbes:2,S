It turned out that Andrea's patch is needed and it needs to be
augmented slightly.  The loop_thread can do the following:
loop_thread
-> do_bh_filebacked
-> lo_send
-> ...
->  kmem_cache_alloc
-> ...
-> shrink_cache
-> try_to_release_page
-> try_to_free_buffers
-> sync_page_buffers
-> __wait_on_buffer
And if the buffer must be flushed to the loopback device we deadlock.
The following patch is the Andrea's one + one additional change -- we
don't allow the loop_thread to wait in sync_page_buffers.
