I don't have the MII standard, my knowledge is from the DP83840A specs:
The pin description contains a section about the phy ids:
During power up five pins are latched to determine the initial phy address.
Then the following sentence in bold: "An address selection of all zeros 
(00000) will result in a PHY isolation condition".
I've reread the DP specs and I now think that your current patch is 
sufficient:
The isolate state is independant from the phy address - a non-zero phy 
can be in isolate mode and the phy zero can be non-isolated. The phy id 
just sets the power-up value of the isolate bit: 0 means start isolated, 
non-zero means start non-isolated.
If this is really true then handling phy 0 is trivial:
First scan 1-31. If nothing found: try 0. If a phy is found: clear the 
isolate bit and then use phy 0.
