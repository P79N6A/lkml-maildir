Tim,
No it does not, from my understanding it only pertains to x86_64 but
currently i run i386 SMP enabled kernel on the dualcore X2 processor.
Also worth noting is that i do not see any failures or errors in dmesg
related to lost timers. Perhaps this is something new? I even run  a
script from the bugzilla and the output matched both cpu's.
Thanks,
	Paul
