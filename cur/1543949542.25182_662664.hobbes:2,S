Subject: [PATCH 47/52] leave irqs enabled while calibrating delay.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/3/3/302

although i386 appearantly does not have problems with the nmi,
we leave irqs enabled, as it is common ground between it and x86_64.
