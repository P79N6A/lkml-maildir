Agreed! When I developped the cmov emulator, I used an early C3 for the
tests (well, a "Samuel2" to be precise), because it did not report "cmov"
in its flags. I first thought "wow, my emulator is amazingly fast!" because
it took something like 50 cycles to do cmovne %eax,%ebx.
Then I realized that this processor performed cmov itself between
registers, and only triggered the invalid opcode when one of the operand
was a memory reference. And this time, for a hard-coded instruction, it
was really slow...
For this reason, I would not be surprized at all that there would be some
buggy behaviour in the cmov right there. Maybe a bug in the decoder unit
making it skip a byte when the next instruction in the prefetch queue is
a cmov affecting same registers... When vendors can do dirty things such
as executing unsupported instructions, we can expect anything from them.

I generally use the P5MMX target for such processors.
