btw, not after a buffer, but after as much as "buffers per page" buffers
(infact for the code to be correct on systems with quite big page size
the 32 should be replaced with a max(bh_per_page, 32))

	write 32 buffers
				read generation
	inc generation
				generation changed -> OOM
Am I missing any smp serialization between the two cpus?
