A detail of his system of archives:
PROPERTIES AND PARTICULARITIES OF THE FILE SYSTEM
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- FILES, DIRECTORIES AND OTHER ONES
In the system of archives they can create for oneself directories, files 
and link to databases and link to another TL Systems. The files keep in 
blobs in the table SYS_FILES_BLOB. The first blob of the file is the 
numbered with a 0 and he contains additional information of the file. 
There the user can introduce a comment of text for example. When he has 
to do with to a database or another system a link, a blob be believed 
that he contains the precise information to be able to establish the 
connection ( numbered I eat 1 ). In TL the System can perform on a file 
also like directory. Could have stored within this old versions of the 
same or related files with the. When a file, perform on form of this, it 
becomes of the mixed type ( Directory File ) The information that he 
contains like file is respected, but they can call him as it stops a 
directory to be able to enter within this another files, link or 
directories. There can be over a file, directory or link with the same 
name in a same directory. The system permit the easy implementation of 
mirrors placed in any point of the net or simple replications to act of 
backup.
- A FILE'S PROPERTIES
All of them have a user and group principal owners. And besides, they 
can belong to another groups. But the permissions of access and 
restrictions determine themselves for the user.
- USERS AND GROUPS
A user has a principal group. But it can belong to a group over. 
Permissions for the system of archives in TL System they determine for 
the user group. If a file belongs to the group X and the user also, the 
restrictions that this have for that group will be applied.
