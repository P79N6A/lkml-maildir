I benchmarked try3 on top of pre6 and I get this:

graph updated attached. so in short my fast path is still quite faster (r1/w1),
slow path is comparable now (I still win in all tests but wo which is probably
the less interesting one in real life [write contention]). I still have room to
improve the wo test [write contention] by spending more icache btw but it
probably doesn't worth.
