Well, a lot of the work can be done for us by the kernel. As long as the kernel
supports PCI, all devices on the PCI bus are reported via /proc/pci and/or
/proc/bus/pci. The CPU type is already in /proc/cpuinfo. And something like
pnpdump from the isapnptools can help quite a lot as well. That should be enough
to take care of around 75% of all the systems running linux, and for the rest
you could implement an expert mode where they could select non-pci/isapnp and/or
advanced options (fbcon, serial terminal, etc) with a standard (perhaps more
informative in places) help system.
Another approach would to have pre-set "kernel options profiles" for certain
makes/models of computers for, say, a user-type person switching a box they
bought at Computer City from Windows to Linux.

That's just because nobody has done it yet. :)
