Yeah, maybe.

I'm working on local counter (local_t) allocator which is used to
replace percpu allocation in percpu_counter and used as basis for
percpu_ref which replaces module ref counting and will be used to
simplify block/char lifetime rules.
The local counter allocator allocates per-cpu pages and the space
overhead is minimal.  If per-cpu stats in genhd is necessary, I think
converting it to percpu local counter allocation should do it.
BTW, why make percpu area static?
Thanks.
