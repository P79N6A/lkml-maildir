Very few McDonalds have a digital camera behind the register to loan out.  I 
was lucky they printed out some blank cash register paper for me to write the 
panic down on.  (Ordinarily, I take notes on my laptop...)
If this was easily reproducible, I'd recreate it at home under a serial 
console.  (Well, this being a "modern" laptop with no serial port, maybe I 
could I could rig up a parallel port console or something.  But the 
principle's the same.  No, don't ask me why this thing has no serial port but 
does have a parallel port.  Ask IBM.)
Does netconsole handle panics?  (Would it work through a wireless card on an 
internal cardbus?  I also have a pcmcia 10baseT card around here somewhere I 
could plug a some cat5 into, if I can get any untangled from the big ball of 
miscelanous obsolete computer stuf in the "old parts" box.  It's been a 
couple months since I needed to reclaim anything that box, but I think I know 
where I left it.  I vaguely remember a friend asking me what an 
unrecognizable component was...  For the record, it was a 5 1/4 to 3.5 floppy 
cable adapter...)
