Designed behaviour.  sys_delete_module only removes autoclean modules
that have been used at least once, either they have been used or some
other module has a reference to them.  Otherwise you get nasty races
like this
  cpu 0                           cpu 1
  request_module(foo)
    modprobe -k foo
      insmod -k foo
        foo is loaded, unused
  kernel sees foo has loaded
                                  rmmod -a
  kernel uses foo
