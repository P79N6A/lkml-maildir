Hi Andi,
No.  I didn't see your mail until this morning.
It looks like we were working in lock step.  I had been meaning to
update the patch so when I saw that Andrew had dropped it from 
2.6.2-rc1-mm3 it seemed like a good time.
I'll leave it to you and Andrew to decide how we should resolve our
conflicting patches.
I'm including my notes on the difference between our patches.

arch/x86_64/kernel/kgdb_stub.c
	Lots of white space changes.  I assume these are my fault.
	I use the variable kgdb_enable to decide if the system should
	stop in kgdb on an oops or other failure.  My intention was to
	set this variable when the user connected.  I was doing this
	for serial but not for kgdboe.  
	I removed a \n from print_extra_info.
init/main.c
	This change puts trap_init before parse_args().  I needed this
	for the early entry into kgdb with the gdb command line argument
	to work.
arch/x86_64/boot/compressed/head.S
arch/x86_64/boot/compressed/misc.c
include/linux/config.h
	On the i386 asm/kgdb.h is included from config.h.  These changes
	make the x86_64 do the same.  I'm not a fan of globally
	included header files, but I wanted the x86_64 to work the same
	as the i386.  The asm/kgdb.h provides a stub for
	kgdb_process_breakpoint() avoiding the undefined symbol.
arch/x86_64/kernel/irq.c
	This change is not needed with the change above.
arch/x86_64/Kconfig
arch/x86_64/Kconfig.kgdb
	We used a different approach to selecting DEBUG_INFO.
	I was not really happy with the way select DEBUG_INFO worked.
Makefile
	I added -g to AFLAGS so the .S files get line number info.
	I have a problem where gdb identifies error_exit as being
	in elf_core.h.  I had hoped this would help.  It didn't,
	but I still like this change.
include/linux/bitops.h
	I dropped this one.  I suspect that this fixed a compile 
	warning in a forgotten Concurrent tree.
include/asm-x86_64/kgdb_local.h
	This file seems to be missing from your patch.  Maybe I'm 
	missing something.  In my patch it is a copy of the i386
	version.
