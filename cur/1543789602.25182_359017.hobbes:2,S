Subject: 2.6.14-rc4-rt9: lpptest removed?

When using 'make menuconfig' for 2.6.14-rc4-rt7, the option for:
Parallel Port Based Latency Measurement Device
is available (CONFIG_LPPTEST).
When using 'make menuconfig' for 2.6.14-rc4-rt9, this option doesn't 
appear to exist.  From the thread, it looks like the changes were minor, 
so was an accident?  Although, diffing the patches, nothing leaps out at 
me, so perhaps I'm mistaken somehow?
I threw a 'CONFIG_LPPTEST=m' into the newer kernel's .config to see what 
would happen.  No lpptest.ko was produced :(.
