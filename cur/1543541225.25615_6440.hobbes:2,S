Since when can it be passed to out[bwl]

I actually believe just making buggy drivers not work will be sufficient.
Even if it wasn't changing the type from void * to unsigned long won't
make any code miscompile.

Have we actually tried breaking things for the simple dereference case ?

Maybe it's also that it's easy to convert the void * and their code
actually works (which it shouldn't).  Even simply adding or subtracting 1
from the ioremap return value should catch the problem - strange effects
on i386, unaligned traps and even stranger effects on most risc
architectures.
