Did you use a newc-format cpio archive?  Sounds like yes, but I want to
be sure.

You need a patch to force the kernel not to bother trying to mount a
root filesystem.  This has been floating around for a while somewhere. 
If you don't use this patch, the kernel won't fall through to initramfs
and panics instead, as you are seeing.
Ooh, I see that Olaf Hering has a recent variant of this patch which is
in -aa kernels.  Andrew, can you consider dropping this into -mc or -mm,
please?  It won't break normal operation, but will relieve the pain of
the not-yet-battle-scarred.  It's less fugly than the earlier dev=0:0
patch.  Maybe.
