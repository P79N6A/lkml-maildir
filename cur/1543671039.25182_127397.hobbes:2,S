Well, if you have the pre-reserved area, you just start swapping pages out
into it. If we need a few pages (like 10) to manage data structures, etc,
we can just allocate those at boot, and keep them ready.

Not sure that quite works ... don't you need PTE's to know what to swap
out? Those can be in highmem. However, all user pages would fit in pageset
2, I think.

The more I think about this, the more it seems so much simpler to just
require a reserved swap area the size of your RAM to suspend into. Would
make the code so much simpler ... forget the option bit I suggested earlier
;-)
