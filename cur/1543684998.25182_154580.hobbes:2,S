That's ugly, plus the "_p" suffix is kind of a
standard for "predicate". (__builtin_constant_p, etc.)
I'm using these in the procps project:
// tell gcc what to expect:   if(unlikely(err)) die(err);
#define likely(x)       __builtin_expect(!!(x),1)
#define unlikely(x)     __builtin_expect(!!(x),0)
#define expected(x,y)   __builtin_expect((x),(y))
That makes a slight change to the meaning, since the
original value is no longer available. I've not
found that to be any trouble at all; if it is then
you could work around it using a statement-expression
with a variable, cast, and/or __typeof__.
Something like this:
#define likely(x) ({   \
__typeof__ (x) _tmp;    \
__builtin_expect(!!_tmp,1); \
_tmp; \
})
