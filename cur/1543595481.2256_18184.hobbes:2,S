In the get_zeroed_page()function, address = page_address(page)
1)Does address point to a contiguous block of 4KB of physical memory?     i.e.can I access the individual bytes by *address++?
2)How is page_address() function defined? I did a grep and found something like: #define page_address(page) ({ if (!(page)->virtual) BUG(); (page)->virtual; })? What's (page)->virtual?
Thanks
Any help would be greatly appreciated.
