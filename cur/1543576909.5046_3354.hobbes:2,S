Hmm... In 2.4 we can make the situation with superblock lock on ext2
much better. I didn't go the whole way down to spinlocks, but right now
I'm sitting on a box with modified ext2 that doesn't do _any_ IO in
protected parts of ext2_new_inode()/ext2_new_block(). I can try to
extract the relevant parts of the patch if you are interested (it also
got directories-in-pagecache stuff and better SMP threading of
get_block()/truncate()). The thing seems to be working fine and I see
no serious contention on lock_super(). Dunno if it's worth doing before
2.4.0, but since it has zero impact on the rest of tree (OK, zero except
that write_on_page() had been exported, but I could trivially get rid
of that)... Maybe 2.4.early would be a good idea.
