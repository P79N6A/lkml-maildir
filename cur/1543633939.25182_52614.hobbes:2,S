As additional detail this works for the bridge manufactures because they
can get the BIOS to do the hard work, and the os doesn't have to touch it.
For any component that isn't designed to be part of a plug-in card,
there isn't a compelling reason for the vendors to follow a standard
interface for configuring it.  Only the use case must follow a
standard interface.
