It sounded wrong to me, but it gets done ALL OVER.

Do you prefer:
a) make a function
	sys.c: ksetgroups(int gidsetsize, gid_t *grouplist)
   which does the same as sys_setgroups, but without the copy_from_user()
   stuff?  The only user (for now, maybe ever) is nfsd.
b) make a function
	sys.c: nfsd_setgroups(int gidsetsize, gid_t *grouplist)
   which does the same as sys_setgroups, but without the copy_from_user()
c) make the nfsd code build a struct group_info and call
   set_current_groups()
