Playback results in infinite loop over the first quarter second or so
of audio.  Using "aplay" results in same looping behavior over a longer
segment of audio -- maybe a half second.

Identical results to using "play" (as expected): for the 50K ".wav"
file, I hear the entire file approx. 1.8 times.
I tried a few rmmod/insmod cycles with different values for dma2.
Results as follows:
(a) dma2=1 (== dma1): no change
(b) dma2 option omitted : no change
(c) dma2=-1 : probe failed
