IMHO, the real problem is that in the 'virtual world' (software,
mathmatics, etc) the development costs of such things is not great. For
instance, I 'invented' an arithmetic coder while in high school. At the
time I was completely unaware of IBM's patents or anything. Does IBM
deserve a patent that a high-schooler can reinvent?
