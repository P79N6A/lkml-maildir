Version 1.9 of my x86 performance-monitoring counters driver is
now available at 
http://www.csd.uu.se/~mikpe/linux/perfctr/.
Summary:
Version 1.9, 2001-02-13
- Fixed compilation problems for 2.2 and SMP kernels.
  [Caused by the kernel not passing "-nostdinc" to gcc, and
  RedHat 7.0 including 2.4.0 kernel headers in /usr/include/.]
- Corrected VIA Cyrix III support. The "VIA Cyrix III" product
  has apparently used two distinct CPUs. Initial CPUs were a
  Cyrix design (Joshua) while current CPUs apparently are a
  Centaur design (Samuel). Added support for "Samuel" CPUs.
  [NOTE: This could use some testing on real HW. Any volunteers?]
- Two corrections in the K7 perfctr event list.
- Small tweaks to vperfctr interrupt handling.
- Added preliminary interrupt-mode support for AMD K7.
Future changes on the perfctr-1.x branch will be limited to bug
fixes and updated glue patches for new 2.2 kernels. New features
and hardware support will be implemented in the perfctr-2.x branch,
but it will only support 2.4/2.5 kernels. (Sorry, but maintaining
compatibility with 2.2 kernels is taking too much of my time.)
