When I try to run Java Applets with sound inside my 32-bit chroot within a firefox 32-bit I get this the first time:

I'll just contine from the quick summery...
I am using a 32-bit chroot installtion within my 64-bit installation to run Java Applets from a firefox that I have got within my 32-bit chroot
I installed my 32-bit chroot after this howto:
https://alioth.debian.org/docman/view.php/30192/21/debian-amd64-howto.html#id271998
I have got two soundcards in my system 
1) Creative Soundblaster (Surround speakers, pci-card)
2) Uli/Intel/Realtek, alsamixer says it chip is "Realtek ALC850", I dont really know what it is (headphones, integrated into mainboard)
I normally switch between these during the day but when I have got this error message in the kernellog I cant switch to the creative sound card only the built-in thing works.
