It appears this way if you just look at none_status, but you didn't look
at loop_init_xfer().  Notice that it doesn't call xfer->init unless
type != 0, so that flag is infact never set.

I'm not using highmem.

The block dev it is being used on must be larger than your RAM.  I don't
have any swap on this machine, so I don't know if it must be bigger than
that too.  Maybe disabling swap before testing this oops will make it
work?
In any case, the patch sent by Andrew Morton fixed this bug.
