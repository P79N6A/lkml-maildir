The input core really is designed for actual input devices, rather
than devices that send out arbitrary largish amounts of data.
The driver would probably be simplified a bit (superficially) by
sending barcodes as events (it would have to be multiple events
per barcode -- the input core has very small communications with
userland), but it would complicate userspace quite a bit, and it's
really just not the sort of thing I'd expect in the input core.
However, if you can think of a way to send the barcodes as a single
event, without changing the userland input core interface, I'm all
ears :)
