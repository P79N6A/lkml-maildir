I have a VIA EPIA M motherboard.
http://www.viavpsd.com/product/epia_m_spec.jsp?motherboardId=81
A 2.4.20 gentoo-sources kernel compiled with
CONFIG_MCYRIXIII blows up during boot.  Basically just after
hitting return on grub the screen turns to all blue 'V's and
then the acts like someone pushed the reset button.
386 and 586 kernels work fine.
I'm running gcc 3.2.3
