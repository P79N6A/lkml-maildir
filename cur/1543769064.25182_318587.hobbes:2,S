You'd be better off pointing out that 'man 2 write' lists the errors that
might be returned as:  EBAF, EINVAL, EFAULT, EFBIG, EPIPE, EAGAIN, EINTR,
ENOSPC, and EIO.
Does the POSIX spec allow write() to return -EROFS?
What happens if you're writing to an NFS-mounted file system, and the remote
system remounts the disk R/O?  What is reported in that case?

All fine and good, until you hit a case like ext3 where reporting
the FS error code will better explain the *real* problem than forcing
it to fit into one of the provided VFS errors.

I think that's been done, and the VFS behavior is "if the FS reports
an error we pass it up to userspace".
