Don't enable EABI unless you have changed userspace to be EABI compliant.
Also check that you have NWFPE enabled if you're not using a soft-float
userspace.
You could also build the kernel with DEBUG_USER enabled and pass
user_debug=-1 on the kernel's command line, and see if you get any more
information.
