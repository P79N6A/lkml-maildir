Hrmm, ah, hrmm.  Perhaps I need a little help with this one :)
Just for testing, I modified cdrom_select_speed in ide-cd.c to use SET
STREAMING.  Working from the Fuji spec, I created a 28-byte buffer, set
the starting lba to 0, the ending lba to 0xffffffff, the read speed to
0x000000ff, and the read time to 0x000000ff, expecting a resulting speed
of 1KB/ms or 1000KB/s[1].  I assign the buffer to pc.buffer and send it on
its way to cdrom_queue_packet_command().
The result is:
CDROM_SELECT_SPEED failed: Input/output error
hdc: status timeout: status 0x80 { Busy }
hdc: DMA disabled
hdc: ATAPI reset complete
Am I barking up the wrong tree?   Do I need to use a different function,
or a generic command instead of a packet command?
Regards,
Jeffrey
[1] Interesting that there appears to be enough room in the spec for a
drive transferring 2^32 * 1000 KB/s.
