Oops!  I guess I was just lucky that part didn't fail :-D  On the other 
hand, it
couldn't legally return 0 anyway, could it?  That would have been a 
slightly
more sensible error code, IMHO, anyway, but it probably came from some
silly standard somewhere.

Apple's BSD derivative came out of the main tree several years ago, and 
it
wasn't really maintained for a few years, so it missed out on a lot of 
bug
fixes and such.  They've tried to catch up on a lot of that and been 
mildly
successful, but it still has a ways to go.
