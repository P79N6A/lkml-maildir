Subject: [PATCH -mm 2/2] wait_task_stopped: simplify and fix races with SIGCONT/SIGKILL/untrace
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/11/22/62

wait_task_stopped() has multiple races with SIGCONT/SIGKILL. tasklist_lock does
not pin the child in TASK_TRACED/TASK_STOPPED stated, almost all info reported
(including exit_code) may be wrong.
In fact, the code under write_lock_irq(tasklist_lock) is not safe. The child
may be PTRACE_DETACH'ed at this time by another subthread, in that case it is
possible we are no longer its ->parent.
Change wait_task_stopped() to take ->siglock before inspecting the task. This
guarantees that the child can't resume and (for example) clear its ->exit_code,
so we don't need to use xchg(&p->exit_code) and re-check. The only exception
is ptrace_stop() which changes ->state and ->exit_code without ->siglock held
during abort. But this can only happen if both the tracer and the tracee are
dying (coredump is in progress), we don't care.
With this patch wait_task_stopped() doesn't move the child to the end of the
->parent list on success. This optimization could be restored, but in that case
we have to take write_lock(tasklist) and do some nasty checks.
Also change the do_wait() since we don't return EAGAIN any longer.
