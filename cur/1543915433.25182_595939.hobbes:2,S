I did an patch to do that recently because  the current setup
is indeed unobvious.
But I had to drop it again because 
it ended up with Kconfig warnings. about undefined symbols
on x86-64. The problem is that lguest
is visible in Kconfig for all architectures and it warns
if you select something that doesn't exist on all architectures.
The only workaround would have been to define PARAVIRT
for all architectures, which I considered too ugly.
I think Sam stated recently he wanted to remove that warning
but it needed some infrastructure work.

Is there a significant user base? 
At least the Xen port seems to have specific requirements
and essentially only work on xen-unstable (?) [or at least
some very new Xen version] which probably very few
people use.
