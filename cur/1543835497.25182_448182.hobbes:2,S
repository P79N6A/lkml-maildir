Oh, forgot to mention, if vice-versa you don't mind always loading you 
don't _have_ to supply a match() method at all.
Maybe you make your port/irq/dma parameter variables in the driver 
writable through sysfs or, heaven forbid, you do autoprobing meaning 
that there's nothing left that could not be fixed while the driver is 
loaded. If you don't provide a .match, your .probe is called always 
directly.
