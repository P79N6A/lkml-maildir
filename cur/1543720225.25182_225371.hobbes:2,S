Just noting, if you want the -mm patches as a BK tree so that you don't
have to guess quite that much ;-)  they're available as
bk://smurf.bkbits.net/linux-2.6.#-rc#-mm#.
Additional benefit: I pull from the various BK trees, instead of applying
Andrew's bk-* patches.
I try to be reasonably timely generating them.
