Hi,
I've just received an IBM Thinkpad A22e. Using kernel 2.4.2-2 (redhat 7.1
version) or the stock 2.4.4 or 2.4.9 (they all exhibit the same problem).
When I use any of the APM functions or any of the thinkpad keys (volume
keys and Fn-Fx keys.. for suspend and even display brightness), the whole
system freezes without any other indication. This is using a kernel with
APM compiled it, but without any other option. If I compile in ACPI
instead of APM, it freezes even before the kernel is done booting. But, it
worked perfectly well with the 2.2.19-2 kernel form Mandrake 7.2
Everything else seems to work fine... can anyone help?
