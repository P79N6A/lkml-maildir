Some StrongARM CPUs seem to exhibit non-coherence in their write buffers.
I don't think we've done enough testing to make any statement like "ARMs
have uncoherent write buffers."
Tests need to be run on a larger proportion of the following:
*	ARM720
	ARM920
	ARM922
	ARM925
	ARM926
	ARM1020
	ARM1022
	ARM1026
*	StrongARM-110	(DEC/Intel)
	StrongARM-1100	(DEC/Intel)
*	StrongARM-1110	(Intel)
*	Xscale		(Intel)
	PXA		(Intel)
And so far, there are only results for 4 of these devices, with some
revisions of StrongARM-110's passing and others failing.

Not correct.  Because of the fundamental nature of VIVT caches, there
is no "SHMLBA" value which prevents aliases occuring.  Think carefully
about the structure of a VIVT cache and how it would be searched.  This
isn't a chip bug.
The kernel works around this, but, due to some bugs on StrongARM chips
in the write buffer, it appears that we need further work-arounds, which
are already implemented.
