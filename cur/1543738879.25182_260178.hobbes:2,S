Hello, Paul,
OK. I agree with you.

Subject: [PATCH] net: fix smc91x build for sh/ppc
Date: Tue, 12 Oct 2004 19:16:32 +0300
> The current smc91x code uses set_irq_type(). It looks like the m32r guys
> worked around this by adding a !defined(__m32r__) check, but this is equally
> bogus as set_irq_type() is an arm/arm26-specific function.
> 
> Trying to get this to build on sh died in the same spot, so we just back out
> the m32r change and make it depend on CONFIG_ARM instead. Notably, the ppc
> build would have been broken by this as well, but it doesn't seem like anyone
> noticed this there yet.
