OK, but let users, who still build kernels as root, alone.
In `19-rc3/include/Kbuild.include', just below `as-instr' i see:
,--
|cc-option = $(shell if $(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(1) -S -o /dev/null -xc /dev/null \
|             > /dev/null 2>&1; then echo "$(1)"; else echo "$(2)"; fi ;)
|
|# cc-option-yn
|# Usage: flag := $(call cc-option-yn, -march=winchip-c6)
|cc-option-yn = $(shell if $(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(1) -S -o /dev/null -xc /dev/null \
|                 > /dev/null 2>&1; then echo "y"; else echo "n"; fi;)
`--
so, change to `-o /dev/null' in `as-instr' will just follow this.
