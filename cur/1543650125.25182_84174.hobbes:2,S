I have got a new crash on the same box with CONFIG_DEBUG_SLAB=y
(reminder: Kernel 2.4.19)
Unable to handle kernel paging request at  virtual address 5a5a5a5e
EIP : 0010:[<c02318a9>] <ip_route_input_slow+33>
EAX : 00000000   EBX : 5a5a5a5a   ECX : 9c515bec

EBP : c1aae690   ESP : c02f3e44
Process Swapper (pid: 0, stackpage = c02f3000)
Stack: 5a5a5a   ccb5b542   d71a10ac   c1aae690
(sorry, first stack word was written down incorrectly by operator, one
byte lost)
Call Trace:

(I find this stack trace strange. Once again I  haven't  written  this
down myself so I can't be sure it's 100% accurate)
Code : ff 42 04 b8 54 24 24 89 54 24 28 c7 44 24 20 00 00 00 00 c7
Still the same exact place in ip_route_input_slow:
(gdb) x/i 0xc02318a9
0xc02318a9 <ip_route_input_slow+33>:    incl   0x4(%edx)
0xc02318ac <ip_route_input_slow+36>:    mov    0x24(%esp,1),%edx
0xc02318b0 <ip_route_input_slow+40>:    mov    %edx,0x28(%esp,1)
0xc02318b4 <ip_route_input_slow+44>:    movl   $0x0,0x20(%esp,1)
0xc02318bc <ip_route_input_slow+52>:    movl   $0x0,0x38(%esp,1)
0xc02318c4 <ip_route_input_slow+60>:    movl   $0x0,0x34(%esp,1)
It looks to me that the value in DX is "poisoned" data isn't it?
I assume that the kernel is trying to use dynamic memory that has been
released already, right?
What's next in tracing this one down?
Thanks for any hint,
_Alain_
