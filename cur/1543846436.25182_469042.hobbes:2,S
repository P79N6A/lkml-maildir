	ESSID is supposed to be up to 32 char, so we need to full
buffer size.

	Yes, it is entirely useless, but not incorrect. Note that the
code was not very efficient to start with, the last char of the string
was set to NUL twice.
	I don't really want to overstep my authority there, my goal
was to minimise the changes. Pavel will have to clean up my mess, so I
don't want change things too much.

	No, that would bring back the slab/memory overflow we are
trying to get rid of.
