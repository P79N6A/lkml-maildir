What can happen is, as soon as you unthrottle the previous queue, 
another thread can come in and put another request on it.  Sure, that 
thread will likely block on the physical throttle and so will the rest 
of the incoming threads, but it still allows the higher level queue to 
grow past any given limit, with the help of lots of threads.  JVM for 
example?
Say you have a device mapper device with some physical device sitting 
underneath, the classic use case for this throttle code.  Say 8,000 
threads each submit an IO in parallel.  The device mapper mapping 
function will be called 8,000 times with associated resource 
allocations, regardless of any throttling on the physical device queue.
Anyway, your approach is awfully close to being airtight, there is just 
a small hole.  I would be more than happy to be proved wrong about 
that, but the more I look, the more I see that hole.

Quite true.  In some cases the simple inc/dec per bio works just fine.  
But the general case where finer granularity is required comes up in 
existing code, so there needs to be a plan.
