I would argue that this is talking about sizeof(*p) vs. sizeof (struct foo)
rather than sizeof(*p) vs. sizeof *p.
You wouldn't write:
	return(*p);
but rather
	return *p;
And sizeof is an operator not a function, so I think the same usage
would apply.
With that said the prevalent kernel usage does seem to be sizeof(*foo)
(by about 10 to 1).  But I can't help feeling it looks silly.
