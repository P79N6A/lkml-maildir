But that's because of ia64's cache coherency implementation. I don't really
follow the documentation to know whether it should be one way or the other,
but surely it should be done either before or after the set_pte_at, not both.
Anyway, how about fremap or mprotect, for example?

You're right, sorry I was mistakenly looking at the flush_range. That was
my only immediate concern with your patch... So, for finding and fixing
that bug you have my admiration :)
OK, I'm still not sure that I understand why lazy_mmu_prot_update should be
used rather than flush_icache_page (in concept, not ia64 implementation).
Sure, flush_icache_page isn't given the pte, but let's assume we can change
that.

That's the theory. However, I'd still like to know how the arch code can
make the assertion that icache is known to be at all times other than at
the time of a fault?
Ie. what if an operation which causes incoherency is carried out _after_
an executable mapping is installed for that page.
