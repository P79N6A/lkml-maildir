Something crackpot ala;
The new boot process would look something like this (pseudo code as i 
don't know the types you use yet), just watch out for num_booting_cpus 
users.
/* the fake cpus we're going to fire up and fail */
cpumask_t fake_cpu_map = (1 << 13) | (1 << 14) | (1 << 15);
arch/i386/kernel/smpboot.c
smp_boot_cpus() {
	...
	Dprintk("CPU present map: %lx\n", phys_cpu_present_map);
	for (bit = 0; bit < NR_CPUS; bit++) {
		if ((1 << bit) & fake_cpu_map))
			set_bit(bit, cpu_callin_map);
		....
	}
}
do_boot_cpu() {
	cpu = ++cpucount;
	if ((1 << cpu) & fake_cpu_map) {
		/* you could probably stop here and set the boot error 
		 * without decrementing the cpucount */
		goto skip_hardware_wakeup_bits;
	}
skip_hardware_wakeup_bits:
	return boot_error;
}
Anyway coffee is wearing off and i must sleep...
