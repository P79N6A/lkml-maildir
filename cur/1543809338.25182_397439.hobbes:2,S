Andrew,
thank you very much for your comments.

Yes, sorry, the comment didn't get updated when we did the move from
procfs to sysfs.

We use ringbuffers in two places. I suppose you are talking about the
one implementing our event queue through the ev_head and ev_tail members
of the cardstate structure. You have a point there, although I'm not
sure if it wouldn't be better to take advantage of the atomic_t and do a
little less locking instead.
The other one, within the inbuf_t structure, used for capturing
characters received from the device, is accessed without locking from
the gigaset_handle_event() tasklet and therefore needs atomic_t indexes,
IMHO.

Interesting idea. I have to admit it's rather new to me. I have always
done ringbuffers the way they are done in the Gigaset driver now. Can
you point me to some example code done the way you propose, so I can
familiarize myself with its advantages?

Thanks for the hint. Will watch out for these.

Well, I *hope* there aren't any unnecessary ones, but we'll re-check.
