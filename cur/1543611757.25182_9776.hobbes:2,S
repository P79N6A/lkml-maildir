I am *completely* underwhelmed by ALSA, *especially* in the areas of
usability and documentation! I have an M-Audio Delta 66 sound card and I was
unable to get ALSA to work with it. At the time I attempted this, I did not
have the free time to do c-code-level integration work; I needed something
that was plug-and-play with usable documentation. I ended up buying the
closed-source OSS/Linux driver, which at least installs and boots. Their
documentation isn't much better, and I finally was forced to dual-boot
Windows 2000 to get a usable audio tool set for this device.
My point here is that just because a composer is *capable* of doing
integration work and building or repairing tools (and I am) does *not* mean
he (or she :-) has either the time or the willingness to do so (and I
don't).
