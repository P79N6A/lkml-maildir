How do you currently do that?

In that case you can easily use it to just assign one namespace type
to each tree of process groups. The aggregation is something that
other groups find useful, but isn't required for the user to actually
make use of.

Correct.

Yes. That's why my system supports multiple unrelated hierarchies of groups.

Right, you could certainly do the extra work of tying your virtual
servers together with resource controllers in userspace. But you'd
still need an API to allow those resource controllers to be associated
with groups of processes and configured with limits/guarantees, which
is one of the main aims of my containers patch.

I'm primarily interested in getting something in the kernel that can
be used as a base for interesting subsystems that apply behavioural or
QoS changes to defined groups of processes. Resource controllers and
namespaces seem to be good examples of this, but I can think of useful
subsystems for monitoring, permission control, etc.

Right, adding a pointer to task_struct is easy. Configuring how/when
to not directly inherit it from the parent, or to change it for a
running task, or configuring state associated with the thing that the
pointer is pointing to, naming that group, and determining which group
a given process is assocaited with, is something that's effectively
repeated boiler plate for each different subsystem, and which can be
accomplished more generically via an abstraction like my containers
patch.

The main thing that I'm adding on top of the operations mentioned in
the previous paragraph, which pretty much essentially have to be in
the kernel, is the ability to group multiple different subsystems
together so that they share the same process->container mappings. Yes,
that is something that could potentially be done from userspace
instead, and just provide an independent tree for each subsystem or
namespace. But there seems to be interest from other parties
(including me) in having kernel support for it.
