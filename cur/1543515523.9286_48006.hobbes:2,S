Hello, please cc: me on responses as I am not a list member.
I have a PII 450 sporadically (about once a week) locking up with
"unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address
00000000." The kernel is a custom compile of 2.2.13, the OS is RH5.2
with packages updated to support the 2.2 kernel.
The basic hw is as follows:
CPU: Intel Pentium II (Deschutes)
hda: ATAPI 40X CD-ROM drive       
scsi0: <Adaptec AIC-7890/1 Ultra2 SCSI host adapter>
(scsi0:0:0:0) Synchronous at 80.0 Mbyte/sec, offset 15.
  Vendor: IBM       Model: DDRS-39130D       Rev: DC1B 
eth0: Intel EtherExpress Pro 10/100
The system is heavily used with Apache 1.39, Apache 1.36 + php3 and The
Gimp.
Here are the relevant lines from syslog after the last crash:
Nov  9 12:59:54 kernel: Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference
at
virtual address 00000000
Nov  9 12:59:54 kernel: current->tss.cr3 = 033a1000, %cr3 =
033a1000        
Please advise, thanks!
