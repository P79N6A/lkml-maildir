Maybe some brave soul who has had previous success can help me with this
problem...
Does the SIGSEGV flag mean the same to Linux and Solaris?  I ported over
an application (web server) to Linux and received this disappointing
message.

in /usr/local/apache
This core dump is unsuccessful so I can't debug the problem.  Any help is
appreciated.
