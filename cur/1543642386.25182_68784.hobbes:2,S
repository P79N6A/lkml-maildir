I'm not sure that's entirely true in this case - the Netfinity
8500R is slightly unusual in that it has 3 or 4 PCI buses, and
there's 4 - 8 gigabit ethernet cards in this beast spread around
different buses (Troy - are we still just using 4? ... and what's
the raw bandwidth of data we're pushing? ... it's not huge). 
I think we're CPU limited (there's no idle time on this machine), 
which is odd for an 8 CPU 900MHz P3 Xeon, but still, this is Apache,
not Tux. You mentioned CPU load as another advantage of TSO ... 
anything we've done to reduce CPU load enables us to run more and 
more connections (I think we started at about 260 or something, so 
2900 ain't too bad ;-)).
Just to throw another firework into the fire whilst people are 
awake, NAPI does not seem to scale to this sort of load, which
was disappointing, as we were hoping it would solve some of 
our interrupt load problems ... seems that half the machine goes
idle, the number of simultaneous connections drop way down, and
everything's blocked on ... something ... not sure what ;-)
Any guesses at why, or ways to debug this?
M.
PS. Anyone else running NAPI on SMP? (ideally at least 4-way?)
