Slackware doesn't use xinetd, but rather inetd. Is inetd an
old version which is no longer maintained? Apache, it didn't
kill, but slowed it down quite a bit. You are correct for sure
on that point though, there is nothing that can be done about
connection floods.

Very true :(

Again - likely a connection flooding DoS there.. Which can't be helped
Unless you use ipchains to limit the amount of connections per ip
address.
Thanks for the reply :)
