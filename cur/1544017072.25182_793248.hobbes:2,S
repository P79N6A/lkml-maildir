Subject: regression: a0d4922 causes PCI host constroller problems

commit a0d4922 ("USB: fix up suspend and resume for PCI host
controllers") causes a lot of these two lines to be logged:
uhci_hcd 0000:00:1d.2: host system error, PCI problems?
uhci_hcd 0000:00:1d.2: host controller process error, something bad
happened!
Normally they appear on resume after suspend to disk, but sometimes I'm
not even sure I had to suspend to disk to see them. Also, it seems like
they don't trigger if X has not been started, or at least they are much
less likely to.
Reverting the patch restores normal operation.
No USB devices were attached BTW.
