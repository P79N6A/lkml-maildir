Some quick debugging showed that I had a whole bunch of modprobe processes sitting around. The new CONFIG_USB_ANNOUNCE_NEW_DEVICES setting makes every startup of udev lock up consistently on at least two machines. It does not seem to be the root of the problem as disabling the option just makes the bug very unlikely.

I'm definitely seeing lockups here too.  2.6.24 is fine, 2.6.24-rc1 or 
-rc2 locks up a minute or so after a successful boot (either to console 
or to X).
Does the following shed any light?
