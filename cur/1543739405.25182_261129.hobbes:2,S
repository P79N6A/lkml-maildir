Okay, you could probably pre-allocate 512K block during bootup, then
just use that instead of allocating new one during suspend.
Unfortunately that's rather ugly. You'd ~32 bytes per 4K page, that's
almost 1% overhead, not nice. Better solution (but more work) is to
switch to link-lists or integrate swsusp2.
