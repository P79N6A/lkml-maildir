Hi,
After upgrading from 2.5.24 to 2.5.25 (actually bk changeset level
1.628 + ide patches 1.633 from linux-ide.bkbits.net), my keyboard
and mouse stopped working.
Switching off CONFIG_X86_UP_IOAPIC made it work again.
The machine is an IBM thinkpad A30p, which actually has an
IO-APIC as far as I can tell from the old boot logs.
