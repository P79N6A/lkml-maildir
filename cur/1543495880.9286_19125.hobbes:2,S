On error, mount() returns -1 and errno is set appropriately, just as with
pretty much every other function that could possibly fail.  =)
However, when mount() fails, the error message is printed not on stdout
nor on stderr, but on the console.  This is, to say the least, annoying,
when you're trying to write an application utilizing mount() in which
mount() can and probably will fail.
I suppose I could remove all of the error messages that are printed out by
the kernel that has to do with filesystems and compile a version of the
kernel for my needs, but I'm thinking other people probably find it a bit
annoying too.  =)
Anyhow, is there a reason why the kernel prints out filesystem error
messages on the console?  Actually, that's kind of a stupid question, so
let me rephrase it a bit.  Is there a reason why iso9660 filesystem error
messages need to be printed out on the console?  =)
Thanks,
Mike Eldridge
