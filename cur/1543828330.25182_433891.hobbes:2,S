I can't choose the preference of the users of my program.

No hardware correspond to the uinput driver.

I can't ask the users of my program to do that either (actually, they
can't even do this, since they need uinput for just being able to type
things on the console...)

Agreed. But here, what is best? To explicitely load a "uinput" module or
to explicitely open "/dev/input/uinput" ?

So distributions should load every possible virtual device?
In the debian case, it doesn't, but udev has a links.conf script that
creates a /dev/loop/0 entry, which losetup can open when looking for
loop block devices, and hence the loop module gets auto-loaded. This is
the behavior I'd expect.

Ok, but devfs had let me some hope that it would work, and udev doesn't
so much (the abovementioned links.conf file is considered hacky).
