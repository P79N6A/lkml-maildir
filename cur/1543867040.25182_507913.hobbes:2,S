Well no. I write 1 GB in blocks of 1 MB. After that I call fsync. Then I 
process the next Gigabyte...

See above, how I do writing.

I tested this: When I write in blocks of 8kB or less the effect you describe 
happens. But above 100kB blocksize there is no more increase of speed.

My experience with filesystems is: I write some data and the write-function 
returns nearly immediatelly. So I write again. Sometimes it returns only 
after some 100-300ms. I think this happens always then when the buffer is 
full and thus linux starts to write to disk. After this happend, it returns 
again nearly immediatelly and after another while the same trouble happen 
again. But not in a regular order...
I have to store big amounts of data coming from 2 digital cameras to disk. 
Thus I have to write blocks of around 1 MB at 30 to 50 frames per second for 
a long period of time. So it is important for me that the harddisk drive is 
reliable in the sense of "if it is capable of 50 MB/s then it should operate 
at this speed. Constantly."
