Hello
We still have a big trouble while booting an IBM Netfinity 7000.
After having booted the kernel it prints the panic message :
No init found.  Try passing init= option to kernel.
Looking deeper into the kernel main.c code, it shows that the
execve("/sbin/init",..)
returns an error due to a lack of kernel memory (ENOMEM)
This happens with some kernels but not all. It depends on what driver or
patch
are included, but we haven't found one driver that hurts alone the
kernel. 
Sometimes removing a driver makes failing a kernel that worked with it.
The problem only happens with SMP.
Before it happens, no error is detected either by lilo or by the kernel.
The configuration is the following :
We have a Netfinity 7000M10 with 4 Xeon  under Redhat 6.0.
Kernel 2.2.9 smp + patch multi-apic
nic intel etherexpress
scsi disabled
We have tried many different memory configurations and "mem=xxx" at lilo
but
it doesn't solve the problem.
The only good news is when it success at boot, it works perfectly with 4
cpu
loaded (without multi-apic patch only 3 are used).
Other interesting information: this machine won't work with any 3COM
card.
Alexis
