Actually, if you view sendmail as being an expert system it is very
cutting edge :-) It can identify a user from very skimpy data if it
is allowed to (fuzzy matching user names). It identifies local hosts
(with FQDN or partial name, or only host name).

Because then everybodys mail would be owned by user "nobody".
There are some ways to do this, but they are unreliable.
   1. If the users mail is delivered to /var/mail/<username>; then the
      file /var/mail/<username> must always exist.
	This requires ALL MUAs to truncate the file.
	Some MUAs use file existance to determine if there is new mail.
	If it doesn't exist, then no new mail... ever.
   2. sendmail will not be able to create the /var/mail/<username> mail box.
   3. sendmail will not be able to process forwarding mail.
	User nobody should not be able to read files in users home
	directory... .forward files are private to the user...
   4. sendmail will not be able to process user mail filters (same problem
	as forwarding).
	Note: these filters are applied on receipt of mail (saves time and
	disk space since the filter can discard mail immediately or put it
	in appropriate folders immediately).
