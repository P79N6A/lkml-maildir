Agree, but why should it not be a requirement to relearn about the device
everytime it is opened from user-land?  I am assuming events like
fdisk/cfdisk and load/unload events of media.
Since one of the goals with CDR/CD-RW's is to be able to perform a
multi-mount of sessions that react like drive partitions.
This will make a mess, since nothing in the code (that I know of) currents
entertains this possiblity.
