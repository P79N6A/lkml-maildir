Subject: [PROBLEM+PATCH] 2.X zero-length read on non-empty pipe returns EAGAIN

Linus, which means there's no email address to send patches to.
Is this the only place I need to send it? ]
This problem was observed with kernel 2.2.9 on an i386, but appears
from the source to be present in all 2.X kernels.
Description: a read() with count=0 on a pipe that is not empty
should return 0; instead it returns -1 with EAGAIN.
Reproduce by the following program:
----- begin pipebug.c -----
#include <stdio.h>
void main() {
  int fds[2];
  int n; char junk[10];char *data = "0123456789";
  pipe(fds);
  if ( fork() ) {
    close(fds[1]);
    sleep(5); /* just to ensure the write has happened in the child! */
    n = read(fds[0],junk,0);
    printf("Got %d chars\n",n);
    if ( n < 0 ) perror("first read");
    n = read(fds[0],junk,4);
    printf("Got %d chars\n",n);
    if ( n < 0 ) perror("second read");
  } else {
    close(fds[0]);
    write(fds[1],data,4);
    sleep(10) ; /* to avoid closing pipe */
  }
}
----- end pipebug.c -----
Analysis: simple bug in pipe_read() in linux/fs/pipe.c.
Fix: *If* the manual page for read() is correct in saying that 
a read of length zero should always return 0 and do nothing else,
then the enclosed patch is probably right. (Somebody who knows, please
check that it should indeed come after the invalid seek test---I don't
know enough about what the fs routines are defined to do.)
If on the other hand there are circumstances in which such a read
should return an error (e.g. if it is felt that the locking should
still be done), then a slightly less trivial fix is required.
Patch follows:
