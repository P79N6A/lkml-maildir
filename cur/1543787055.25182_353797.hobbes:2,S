Read my reply above again, please.  I did.  It needs to be under
control of the tracer.
Also, this is far from the only problem you're going to have if you run
your debugger with lower priority than your debuggee.

No.  Ptrace is considered a security barrier; the tracee should not be
able to control what the tracer sees.
