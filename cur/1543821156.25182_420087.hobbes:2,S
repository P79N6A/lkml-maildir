That's exactly what happens.
Which is totally bogus, because userspace will think that the setting
didn't succeed. Or application authors will ignore the return value
assuming that it always succeeded. Or read the value back to see if it
succeeded. All icky, when we can well have a good return value.

Which is kinda hard to implement.

Well, I'd argue that it doesn't matter much since sysfs values are by
definition a single value per file, so you'll already know that putting
multiple "values" in is bogus.
