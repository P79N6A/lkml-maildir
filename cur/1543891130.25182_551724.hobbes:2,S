What about the changes to fix the order that MSI-X irqs are returned
in (iirc, list_add had to be changed to list_add_tail in a couple of
places).  Without that change, multiple MSI-X interrupts seem to be
broken: the kernel programs the MSI-X table in the opposite order that
it gives the irq numbers to the driver.  The net effect is that if I
request, say, 3 MSI-X interrupts for a device, then when the device
generates the first interrupt, the driver thinks it generated the
third interrupt, and things go fairly haywire.
