How can the NAPI_STATE_SCHED bit be cleared externally yet we take
this list_move_tail() code path?
If NAPI_STATE_SCHED is cleared, work will be zero which will never be
equal to 'weight', and this we'll never attempt the list_move_tail().
If something clears NAPI_STATE_SCHED meanwhile, we have a serious race
and your patch is an incomplete bandaid.  For example, if it can
happen, then a case like:
		if (test_bit(NAPI_STATE_SCHED, &n->state))
	... something clears NAPI_STATE_SCHED right now ...
			work = n->poll(n, weight);
can crash too.
