We don't do error handling for special commands (REQ_TYPE_ATA_*) at all,
ide_error() just dumps device's status/error register(s) and finishes early:
ide_startstop_t ide_error (ide_drive_t *drive, const char *msg, u8 stat)
{
	struct request *rq;
	u8 err;
	err = ide_dump_status(drive, msg, stat);
	if ((rq = HWGROUP(drive)->rq) == NULL)
		return ide_stopped;
	/* retry only "normal" I/O: */
	if (!blk_fs_request(rq)) {
		rq->errors = 1;
		ide_end_drive_cmd(drive, stat, err);
		return ide_stopped;
	}
[ Yeah, I completely agree that it needs some re-design but I don't see how
  it can be related to the problem experienced by Anders. ]

This is unlikely as we should get some error message from ide_dump_status()
and we are not getting any (Anders, please correct me if I'm wrong).
Moreover the problem was initially narrowed down to commit
852738f39258deafb3d89c187cb1a4050820d555 which is two commits _before_
the one that we are currently discussing.
I think that we are looking into completely wrong direction...
Thanks,
