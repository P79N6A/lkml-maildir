 It should not trigger, because to the best of my knowledge all the chip 
variations we support are covered above.  Ultimately, this should become a 
platform device, where this will become a non-issue.  The conditions have 
been copied verbatim from the original driver.

 Like the last time -- everybody seems to implement it as such.  If you 
think that should be changed, I could see if I find some time to grep the 
tree and reimplement all the to_*() macros.

 Any changes there in the last few days?  Hmm, I must have missed them...  
I'll fix it up next week.

 Again, copied verbatim from the original driver.  It must be a chip 
erratum.  Which is not publicly available, but I think it is still better 
to have it referred to from here than not at all, in case someone wants to 
pester Broadcom about this one.  I can s/bug/erratum/, but I am not sure 
if it won't confuse them then if contacted. ;-)

 No problem at the moment -- I'll change it.  Though I have a strong 
suspicion .startup may have to be overridden at the run time at one point 
because of the way the port #1 is wired on the SWARM board (but nowhere 
else) -- the port is shared with a sound device (if it sounds odd, I can 
provide an overview of the hardware configuration).  Then again, perhaps I 
will do it in a different way...

 Like nowhere in the chip.
