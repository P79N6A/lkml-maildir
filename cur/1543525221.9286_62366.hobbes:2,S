   The basic point is this: If, as a result of experience after the
   e2comp subsystem is folded into the kernel, the decision is taken to
   depreciate a particular compression method, MY opinion is that the
   CORRECT way to do so is as follows:
Well, my suggestion would be to try to figure out if you have enough
information to deprecate some compression methods *before* e2compr gets
folded into the kernel.  That makes life so much simpler for all
concerned.  Once e2compr does get folded into the kernel (especially
once it hits a stable kernel release, or has been in a development
kernel for more than a few revisions) then yes, we have to go through
the fairly long and careful process which you outlined.  
That's why it's better to deprecate features/formats before they go into
kernel....

   I'm dealing strictly with the 0.4 version, so will leave comments
   regarding this to Peter...
How many people are using 0.3 e2compr?  If it's not many, then maybe we
don't even need to bother with a user-space conversion tool.
