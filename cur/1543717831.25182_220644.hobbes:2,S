I tried that first, actually.  In the test case I was trying, it only
worked 33% of the time.  The other 66% of the time, the rm -rf all fit
into the current running transaction, and waiting on the previous
transaction wasn't sufficient to solve the problem.

That was why I was retrying at the top-level functions: ext3_mkdir,
for example.  There won't be a nested journal transaction there.  This
will be an issue for prepare_write(), though.  If we are in nested
transaction, we're going to have to wait for the currently committing
transaction, and hope for the best.  If that's not sufficient, we're
going to have return the ENOSPC failure.
