Hi Robert,
Sorry, I should have been more careful labelling them - those are 2.5.34-preempt
vs 2.5.34-preempt-rcu numbers. I did them first because rcu-poll-preempt
kernel has a conditinal branch in fast path and hence more interesting. 
I will publish the vanilla vs rcu_poll reflex numbers in a few minutes 
from now.
The preemption support have been in RCU for a very long time. IIRC, I added
it in around 2.5.14.
See http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=102084967517192&w=2
Our OLS paper and presentation too deals with preemption -
