Something like "tMpfs" might be a good idea to
show the strange setting :-)

Thank you for your previous e-mail.
I didn't know it reached my computer since my mozilla e-mail
filtering mitakingly classified your kind response into
an unexpected folder. I searched after reading the above paragraph
and found your previous e-mail.

YES!
With the original 2.6.9, the mount didn't complain at all, and
then I got bizarre behavir afterward and udev script and booting
stopped at that point.
But wih your patch, now mount fails.
So now it is a matter of fixing udev script to
take care of the case of failing tmpfs mounting.
I will re-open the debian bugzilla entry concerning this
so that Debian udev package and possibly an upstream package
can be fixed.
tmpfs mount failure example: (I had created /tmp/t-dir.)
duron:/home/ishikawa# mount -n -o size=1m,mode=0755 -t tmpfs none /tmp/t-dir
mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on none,
        or too many mounted file systems
duron:/home/ishikawa#
