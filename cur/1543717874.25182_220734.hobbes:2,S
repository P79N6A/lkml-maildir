It needn't check readpage if it gets the number of bytes to read
passed to it, or gets i_size passed to it.
With do_generic_mapping_read and ->readpage each having a different
idea of how much of the page to process(*), bad things can happen.
They have different ideas about how much they need to process due to
the each one checking i_size on its own.
* That is "copy to userspace" and "read" for do_generic_mapping_read
   and ->readpages respectively.

What I'm thinking of shouldn't cost any cycles, it would require a
change to ->readpage API though. Preferably one where we can tell it
how many bytes to read. I can't see how else to fix it.
If this is not acceptable for 2.6, we could use a nicer variation of
my second patch which at least fixes the truncate problem, and its
remaining race is *much* more improbable.
