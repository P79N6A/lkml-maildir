hm, I have just recently done a port to an architecture (m68k/q40) 
where autoprobing will not work for HW implementation reasons - and
it uses serial.c
I would actually feel much better if all irq autoprobing could be
disabled by some global option for all drivers. How about letting
irq_autoprobe return an error code that would signal the driver
that autoprobing must be avoided?
The only work involved would be changing all drivers to actually
evaluate this error code..
