As I stated in an earlier email, I'm not fond of this either :-)
I don't see a good alternative though. We need to be able to drop the
and check the refcount in nlmsvc_unlink_block. That function is called
from lockd, and we can't have lockd call kthread_stop on itself.
If you see a better way to do this, I'm certainly open to suggestions.
I'll note that my first stab at fixing this problem was to change the
svc_wake_up() call in the rpc callback to a routine to wake up any
lockd on the box that happened to be up. That sidesteps this entire
problem of having to make sure lockd stays up. If we decided that was
the right approach we could dump the last patch in this series
altogether.
That said there could be other use after free bugs lurking in the lockd
code so maybe keeping lockd up until nlm_blocked is empty is the right
thing to do.
