All current versions of info have the ability to access files in a
directory.  ie instead of looking at /usr/info/gcc.info.gz, it looks at
a file in /usr/info/gcc/.  makeinfo (as distributed) does not have the
ability to generate info files in this way.  The changes were pretty
minor, but when the new version came out, I had insufficiently recent
versions of tools to recompile makeinfo and check that my changes worked,
and then I moved and forgot about it.  Someone sufficiently motivated
could redo it; it's not much work.
