Looks like you've got some tab/whitespace damage going on here.

I doubt this one would overflow, but we recenly made changes in similar
tests to use page count rather than byte count.  I belive this should
use get_mm_counter().  Isn't _rss counting pages rather than bytes,
so I think the math is off here.  Something like:
	if ((max_sane_readahead(end - start) + get_mm_counter(tsk->mm, rss)) >
	    tsk->signal->rlim[RLIMIT_RSS].rlim_cur >> PAGE_SHIFT)
