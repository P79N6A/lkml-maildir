There is no such option, unfortunately. The driver attempts to find a 
transceiver with a link up, and uses that as a default. If it can't find
any, then it defauls to using the HomePNA (type HOME) transceiver.
So you have two choices:
1. make sure the interface is connected to a hub/switch when the driver
initializes;
or, if that doesn't work:
2. apply the following patch to the driver:
--- sis900.c.old	Mon Aug 26 14:43:22 2002
+++ sis900.c	Mon Feb  3 21:59:26 2003

It's a crude hack, but it ought to work on your box.
