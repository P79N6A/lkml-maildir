I have had many disappointing try-outs with SuSE in the past, and everytime
when i think, this SuSE version is the one which will have my iron running
at warp 12, it fails again, for me that is. Dunno why that is.
The only thing i mentioned is, that i noticed that the compaq proliant 800,
2x PIII 500 had problems switching on DMA when booting the the default
installed kernel, 2.6.5 from SuSE 9.1 , after a vanilla default installation.
So i may turn the question around : Is SuSE's techsupport or development
dep. aware that there are issue's reported about DMA failing to switch on
when dealing with UDMA DVD writers? As to the machine, the compaq proliant
800 : its already sold, and sadly doesn't run the SuSE linux version.
Cheers,
Robert
