Tru64's vendor compiler has similar features, though I'm not sure if
32-bit mode is enabled by default.  Noteably, Netscape for Tru64 is
compiled with this 32-bit mode, IIRC
People would be surprised how much ground alpha axp broke in userland,
years ago, simply by being one of the first Linux platforms where long
!= int
