 Hmm, that's partially true, actually.  There is no I/O APIC on UP boards
but since P54C, all CPUs contain an onchip local APIC.  There should be no
problem with using the local APIC configured for the virtual wire mode
even if there is no other APIC in the system.  Even wiring is exactly the
same.  But the local APIC can be disabled on RESET in Pentium chips and by
software means on P6 CPUs.  Once disabled it cannot be enabled till the
next RESET.
 AFAIK, there is no problem with the inter-APIC bus dangling (which would
be happening in this case) as long as one does not try to send IPIs.
 So all these systems have a local APIC with it's timer and some other
nice features but the manufacturer chose the easy way and disabled the
unit upon startup.  The "difficult" way would require BIOS switching into
the protected mode and writing a few 32-bit words into the APIC to get
setup right -- what's the deal?...  But who said manufacturers are clever?
