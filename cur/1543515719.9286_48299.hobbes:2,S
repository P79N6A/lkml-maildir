You can't do that anyway!  If it is the *ROOT* filesystem -- there is no
such thing as a "boot filesystem" in Linux -- you don't have any
userspace that you can open symbolic handles from.
There is clearly a disconnect here, and I have utterly no clue what
problem you're trying to solve.  I'm pretty sure that you're asking the
wrong question, because the question you're asking makes no sense.
