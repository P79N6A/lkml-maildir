Much more than that! :) I'm really looking for a complete solution. It's no
good having your X server happily coexist with the framebuffer if the whole
thing snarfs up when I run some game that directly accesses the graphics
hardware. We need to provide an efficient low level device driver that even
games writers will be happy to use. I think it would be a shame to put a lot of
effort into an X-only solution.

I only see the KGI drivers as a set of already implemented rendering engines.
I'm not familiar with the detailed GGI architecture,  but it's irrelevant since
the idea would simply be to take the KGI drivers and repackage them to whatever
parameter passing interface we chose.

Because it's not X-specific, and can also support acceleration if the hardware
supports it and software emulation if it does not.

There's the kgicon driver, but anyways we wouldn't be using the KGI drivers in
their current form. Given that /dev/fb gives direct access to the framebuffer,
that seems to pretty much make it the bottom layer, and /dev/kgi would sit on
top of that, and probably provide a bitblt() function as it's lowest level
method of framebuffer access. It would be much tougher and less efficient to
implement /dev/fb on top of a bitblt() interface.
