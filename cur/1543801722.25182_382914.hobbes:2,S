There's another bug that must be fixed:
SCSI_QLA2XXX must be renamed.
The problem is that up to 2.6.15, it was a not user visible variable 
that was set for _everyone_ with SCSI && PCI and that didn't have any 
influence on what was built.
E.g. it is set in the .config for my computer since my computer has PCI 
cards and I'm using USB mass storage.
Due to the change of SCSI_QLA2XXX to a user-visible option that builds 
the driver, this means that suddenly after upgrading the kernel and 
running "make oldconfig" a SCSI driver gets built the user never 
selected.
Do you have any suggestions for a new name?
We could e.g. name it SCSI_QLAXXXX since the driver also supports 
6312/6322, or name it simply SCSI_QLA.
