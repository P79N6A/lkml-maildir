I can give that a whirl, but it bothers me the way it currently
"works":
* Performance is terrible
* booting with noapic makes no difference
* Performance seems to indicate some kind of difficulties in
  the kernel, perhaps connected to interrupt handling
I have another RH 7.3 box sitting next to the new one, which has
a Sony DVD-ROM.  I just enabled DMA with hdparm and it works very
well.  That is not what happens on the other (troublesome) machine.
So I am wondering:
* Kernel interrupt handling problem (should there be ERR if
  apic is enabled?  which it is)
* IRQ problem?  I haven't tried changing around IRQs.
* IDE controller problem?  Probably not, because the drive seems
  to work the same on the Highpoint controller.
* Problem with this specific drive?  Perhaps.  I've never used it
  before--the last "combo" drive I used was SCSI.  I bought this
  one because it was the same brand as the SCSI drive I used before,
  and as an IDE device it would be about $500 cheaper (no SCSI
  card needed).  I will check to see if a firmware download is
  available.
* Some other m/b problem?  Perhaps, but I've not tried this drive
  in another box.  I am inclined to try that next.
I am also inclined to try the Sony DVD-ROM in the new box to see
if it exhibits the same behavior.
What is the "combo drive" used by the iMac et al.?
