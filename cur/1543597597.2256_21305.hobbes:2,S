In that case, what's the argument for not just replacing the zone
parameter with
	/* If we have enough free pages in this zone, don't bother */
	if (page->zone->nrpages > page->zone->high)
		return;
which works without having a silly single-zone special case (think
multiple small zones, all under pressure, and one large zone that hasn't
seen pressure in ages).
A single-zone parameter just looks fundamentally broken. How do you
determine "which zone"? All allocations are really about zone _lists_, not
single zones.
This same test (maybe nicely abstraced with something like a
"page_zone_pressure(page)" inline function) makes sense in pretty much all
the scanning functions. We want to _age_ the pages in such zones, but we
may not actually want to do anything further.
Comments?
