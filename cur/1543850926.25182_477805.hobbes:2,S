Ok, it was suggested that we revert all of gregkh's patches as a first
stab at a cuplprit.  I reverted the changes between the following two
patches (inclusive):
    gregkh-driver-w1-ioremap-balanced-with-iounmap.patch
    call-platform_notify_remove-later.patch
The first result in is a positive test complete on that machine.  Will
check the remainder of the tests in the morning.
