..
Looking through drivers/pci/*, it appears that the call to pci_intx()
should be totally redundant.  pci_enable_msi() does pci_intx(pdev,0)
on success only, and doesn't touch it otherwise.
Similarly, pci_disable_msi() does pci_intx(pdev,1).
So, where does libata cause pci_disable_msi() to be invoked?
Or is that just missing at the moment?
Thanks.
