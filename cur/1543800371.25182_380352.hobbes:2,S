Hi Jesper,
Oh i thought they were the same, i used memtest86+ which comes with
debian and not the "older" memtest86.
Right now i booted the kernel with nomce since one never knows with dell
machines as i saw on some redhat list. Furthermore i installed the
microcode32 utility which loaded new microcode in the cpu. So i'm now
going to continue put some good load on the system, tv on and so on, see
what happens.
