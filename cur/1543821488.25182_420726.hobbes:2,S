The problem with uint32_t is that it's ugly, it used to be unportable, and 
you can't use it in header files _anyway_.
In other words, there's no _point_ to the "standard type". 
I really object to this whole thing. The fact is, "u8" and friends _are_ 
the standard types as far as the kernel is concerned.  Claiming that they 
aren't is just silly.
It's the "uint32_t" kind of thing that isn't standard within the kernel. 
You can't use that thing in public header files anyway due to name scoping 
rules, so they have basically no redeeming features.
