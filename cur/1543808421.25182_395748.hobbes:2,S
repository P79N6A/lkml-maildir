Mercurial has gotten a lot better about "python dumps" as a signal
that you had typed something wrong, or had permissions problems, etc.
I got annoyed about that too, but I just learned to ignore them and
assume that 90% of the time, it was due to a mistake on my end.
Things are a lot better there; claiming mercurial sucks for its early
rough edges is about as far as claiming that git sucks because its
performance sucked rocks on laptop drives in its early days before
Linus added support for packs.
