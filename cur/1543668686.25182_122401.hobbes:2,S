Looks ok to me, (but i haven't tried it.)

No, I don't think so.  I think we should
allow for the possibllity of concurrent calls 
to this ioctl.  (whether linux allows it is 
another question.  I think it used to be the case
that only one ioctl could get in at a time... I can't
recall if it's still that way.)
