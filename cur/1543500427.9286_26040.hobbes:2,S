Hi,
	Tonight I managed to sliently hardlock my linux box with windows.
I had mounted (some hours before) a rw smb share from a win95 machine via:
smbmount \\\\hemlock\\c somepass -c 'mount /mnt/samba/hemlock/c/'
Some hours later I went to shutdown the windows machine (for the night) in
the middle of lwn and returned to my linux machine a minute later to
finish off reading lwn, and found that the machine had hard locked on me
(no usable sysrq, no console shift, no mouse no numlock). I restarted the
windows machine (to no avail). and had to sysrq+b the machine.
There was no entries in the log /var is mounted rw,sync to try and catch
this kind of thing also remote logs showed nothing either,
Relivent (or not) info:
root@night-shade:~> uname -a
Linux night-shade 2.3.6ac1 #16 SMP Sun Jun 20 00:16:37 BST 1999 i686 unknown
eth0: 3Com 3c905B Cyclone 100baseTx at 0xe800,  00:a0:24:50:09:61, IRQ 18
The server (hemlock) is on a different broadcast subnet to the client
(night-shade) so no windows "I'm going away now" messages would get to it
No processes were running on the mounted fs
Samba version 2.0.3
Any suggestions as to how to trace this I can try? (I am happy to try and
reproduce the error)
