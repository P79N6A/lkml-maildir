I'd say gcc should optimize this out as is already, but now that it doesn't,
if you just make zone_statistics() inline the call will go away with -O2
I checked with gcc 4.0.0 in FC4, the gcc optimizes it without making inline
and with -O1 option too.
Now the main point is how can we incorporate this change in main Linux
kernel.
