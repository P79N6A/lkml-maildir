Right, that's what I said.   It makes the gadget stuff needlessly hard
to find, as well as being less clear about what a "gadget" is than it
really should be.

Only for displaying in its topmost menu...

How can you say that, when you showed (right above!!) that they are???
Sure, there are submenus too.  But they're clearly in the same menu.

Which is why my suggestion was to have them both move up a level, with
host and peripheral side menus nested normally:
	Device Drivers:
		...
		[ ] HID devices
		< > Host side USB
		< > Peripheral side USB
		< > MMC/SD/SDIO card support
		[ ] LED support
		...
That way both host and peripheral side support would have their own
menu, and that pointless nesting would be reduced.
