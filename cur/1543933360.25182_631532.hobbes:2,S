Here are three out of four things which I do frequently with git repos:
I look at
  - commits and blobs in other people's trees with gitweb,
  - commits in a local tree with gitk,
  - specific changes to source code with qgit, using it as "git blame"
    GUI.
(The fourth thing is feeding a driver subsystem git tree at kernel.org
using a minimum number of git commands.  Everything else which I do with
git I do so infrequently that I have to reread manuals all the time.)
