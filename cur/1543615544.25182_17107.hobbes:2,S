"More", in what way? Fixed more problem cases or just better in sense that
he refromatted and splitted the long ext2_new_inode() function?

Ok. The minimal approach is what I was after, too :).
Do you have any opionion about 2.0? The problem has been spotted on 2.0.39,
too, and the 2.0.40pre3 ext2_new_inode() is almost identical to 2.2 one
barring few trivialish changes. We plan to test the patch some more on 2.0
(we already know it compiles and boots, btw ;), but it would be nice if some
one who has played with 2.0 ext2 would give a "go ahead".
