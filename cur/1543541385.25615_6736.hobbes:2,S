My problem is that I'm not really familiar with the high memory support.
The problem here is that the relation between virtual address / physical
address / page struct / memmap+index is hardly documented and it gets
more interesting when a page struct might also represent an i/o area
(for direct i/o).

Another problem on m68k: I can make almost no assumption about the
memory layout to play some clever tricks. If I remember correctly I had
some problems with the memmap layout, since lots of code assumed a
continuos memmap and there were some tricks to get the above
relationship right.
