This one is also buggy.
It is _not_ ok to do this:

since the timer may not even _exist_ any more - the act of running the 
timer may well have free'd the timer structure, and you're now zeroing 
memory that may have been re-allocated for something else.
This is exactly why we load all the timer data into local variables before 
we run the timer function, and we don't touch "timer" afterwards.
In short, you really need to re-visit this whole thing.
