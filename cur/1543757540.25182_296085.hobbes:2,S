Starting around 2.6.11-rc4 I get this printk during the boot process
after kjournald starts, and again if I stress the filesystem.
cfq: depth 4 reached, tagging now on
Is this printk intentional?  I am sure users will wonder about it,
especially because (presumably) cfq turns tagging off at some point in
between, and doesn't say anything about it.
