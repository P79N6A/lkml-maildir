Whoa. Let me recapitulate:
	- first I provide feedback on patches.
	-> I'm told I'm not helping but merely whining.
	- then I offer to fix the problem myself given somebody explains
	what's going on in the code so that I at least know where to start
	and what to look for.
	-> I am told by DaveM to re-read a sentence by DaveM that seems
	to inform me that even if I'm willing to help, I'm likely not able
	to, anyway.
Hello!! How exactly is *this* helping then?
