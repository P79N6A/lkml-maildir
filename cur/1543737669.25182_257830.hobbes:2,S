List,
  I patched my 2.6.8.1 kernel with the inotify-0.11.  There were some
sample utils that in C that came with it.  Thanks.  I've successfully
used those to work with inotify.  Here's what's bad:
1> When I say `cat /dev/misc/inotify' my machine stops responding
instantly.  I've not had a chance to see what happens.  I know I'll not
normally say that but when I say something else dumb like cat
/dev/misc/rtc cat will simply wait, not choke up my whole system.
2> Reading from /dev/misc/inotify with PERL produces the same effect.
I don't know enough about kernel hacking to really debug this really
well.  I peeked at the code and there still seems to be calls to dnotify
functions, can't I remove those?  I said this in
drivers/char/inotify.c(54) static int inotify_debug_flags =
INOTIFY_DEBUG_ALL; so I'll recompile and see what happens.
