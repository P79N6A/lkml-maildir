I like the control Linux used to give me. I ifconfig up the interface,
the machine starts responding to that IP address. (e.g. for requests
from inside the machine). Once I add the route, I can start using that
IP address from the other machine(s) on that interface.
I regularly have both a token ring connection between two machines,
besides the ethernet connection. I get bothered by the kernel defining
routes that I don't need. My "subnet" is on the ethernet, there is
usually just one other machine on the token ring interface. I have to
remember adding "netmask 255.255.255.255" on the ifconfig line every
time I up the token ring interface.... (which without the netmask
specification could easily be done by hand, but now requires a small
script)
