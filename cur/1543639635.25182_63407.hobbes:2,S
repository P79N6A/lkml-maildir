Well on my machine, with Maxtor DiamondMax 40 and Asus A7A255 ->
AliMagic chipset, and with kernel 2.5.26 I was having the same problem
too.
It seems the problem might be because I was using ext3fs, which soon I
found out corrupt the filesystem because of this lost interrupt thing.
Or this problem might occur because my system is an AMD Athlon.
My solution was to move back to ext2fs and kernel 2.4.18, although for
this I needed to fsck the hard drive a couple times because of the
occured corruption to the filesystem.
