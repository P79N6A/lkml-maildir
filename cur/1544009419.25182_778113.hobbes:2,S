What does it buy? 4096/8 = 512 bytes statically allocated?
I understand passing things as pointers, but allocating everything 
dynamically is unCish.

Hm, is there a C trick which will error out when allocating something on 
the stack, but work when allocating statically?  I can think of 
something to do the reverse, but that doesn't help.
Maybe a weak or visibility attribute?  These don't make sense on 
function locals.
