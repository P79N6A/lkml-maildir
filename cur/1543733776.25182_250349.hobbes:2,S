I agree that tunables are a pain in the butt, but a quick fix would to be at 
least to add that 5% to the set of stuff settable in /proc/sys/vm.  Most
workloads/systems won't need to change it.  Very large Altix systems could 
change it if needed.
I don't think that is at the root of the swappiness problems with 
2.6.9-rc1-mm3, though.
