Can you give actual examples of real life situations?
Because quite frankly, it sounds less and less likely for any relevant 
hardware. It's a non-issue for MSI, for example. And it's a non-issue for 
any sane interrupt source I can think of.
In other words, I've heard that claim before - and I just don't believe 
it. I've never heard a realistic explanation of why it would happen for a 
normal PCI driver. And I still claim that it's a very odd and special case 
if it does.
And btw, I'm talking suspend, not hibernate.
