kexec-tools has to be modified to pass the first kernel initrd. On 
powerpc, initrd locations are exported using device-tree. At present, 
kexec-tool ignores the first kernel initrd property values and creates 
new initrd properties if the user passes '--initrd' option to the kexec 
command. So, will be an issue unless first kernel device-tree is passed 
as buffer.

Initrd memory can be excluded like other segments such as RTAS and TCE 
on powerpc. However it is not implemented yet even on powerpc and is an 
issue on other archs.
