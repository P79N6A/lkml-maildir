Yeah, that's what I needed.  end_pfn looks ok, but I guess my test is a 
little too precise.  It should be if ((highest_addr >> PAGE_SHIFT) < 
end_pfn) rather than !=.  That should keep it from trying to extend 
your memory with bogus math.  I thought that the two values should 
always match, but I guess slightly different memory configurations 
might break that assumption.
Thanks,
Jesse
