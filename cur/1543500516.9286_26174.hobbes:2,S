This opens some interesting possibilities:
- updatedb need only run on directories that have been changed;
- more-sophisticated versions of updatedb (full-text indexing?  stat
	data?) could become feasible to update rapidly;
- locate could manually search directories that are newer than updatedb's
	last run, meaning locate could give correct results
- find could be implemented in terms of locate (except for -atime)
- so find would run in time proportional to the number of files you had
	updated since the last updatedb, instead of time proportional
	to the number of files on your disk.  This is likely to be even
	more useful as filesystems expand from millions of files to
	hundreds of millions of files (if reiserfs takes off).
. . . of course this would require that the mtime updates happen 
recursively, all the way down to the root of the filesystem.
I believe NT 4 does this already.
. . .but it breaks Unix semantics.  So it shouldn't be the mtime,
except possibly for certain particular cases.
