Just because it has a higher version number.  Honest, no other
reason was implied.
I'm seriously not trying to push v3 here.  I got into this to try to
dispell myths and get a better grasp of the situation.

Agreed.  Still, some people talk about upgrading from XP to Vista (ok,
no numbers here, but you get the idea), just like they talk about
upgrading from linux 2.4 to 2.6.

Sure, that was not my goal.  I wasn't even trying.
Would you like me to?

Good, it's nice when people get the idea of what I'm trying to
accomplish.  I feared this had been lost in the noise.
