The some filesystems want to use utf-8, and others don't want to use
utf-8, no?  And is it also true about some devices using vfat?

No. Unfortunately the real is not simple like it in some case.

You allow to set any nls to codepage? If so, it is not good.

No, utf-8 makes completely wrong entry. It's more wrong than other nls.

The configurable sounds sane, and it may help some case. But, it should
not be system global. At least, I think the default would be per-filesystem,
otherwise some configs seems to be needed for other filesystem after all.
