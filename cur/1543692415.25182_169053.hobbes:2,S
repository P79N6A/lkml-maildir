Hmm.. anti-circumvention?  I don't see any joy there. 17 USC 1201 doesn't apply.
And I doubt a corporate FTP server qualifies for the ISP 'safe harbor' exemption
except possibly for a 'people/*' subtree where engineers are known to put stuff
without formal corporate review.  You'd have to make a *big* reach to make
17 USC 512 apply here - and I'm not convinced that sending a 512 takedown
order is the right way to send the message we want sent.
