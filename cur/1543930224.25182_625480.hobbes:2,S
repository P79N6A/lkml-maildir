Sure, Linus mentioned the cow idea before in this thread, but you would still 
need a few hacks to get some basic Version Control features.

Because WORKFLOW C is transparent, it won't affect other workflows.  So you 
could still use your normal WORKFLOW B in addition to WORKFLOW C, gaining an 
additional level of version control detail at no extra cost other than the 
git-engine scratch repository overhead.
BTW, is git efficient enough to handle WORKFLOW C?
Thanks!
