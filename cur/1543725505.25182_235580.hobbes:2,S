Yes, but not until after I sent that e-mail.

I suppose it depends on what sort of latencies you're trying to
achieve, and how fast the hardware you're running on is.  In our 2.4
kernel we typically achieved worst case latencies of 50us or so on PC
hardware, and a few hundred us on slower embedded hardware.  Packet
processing would have to be awfully fast to cram 100 packets in that
time...
