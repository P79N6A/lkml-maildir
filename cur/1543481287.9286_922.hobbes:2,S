The "Intel bug check" refers to the EPP timeout bit (bit 0 of the parallel port 
status register [parallel port base + 1 = 0x379]) is always stuck low. EPP is 
something that is extremely difficult to detect and the state of the EPP 
timeout bit becomes critical during probes.
Where EPP becomes tricky is that while accessing the EPP data ports (base+4 to 
base+7) the CPU is held in a HALT state until the EPP transaction is complete. 
If there is no EPP device present then after a small period (10 usec normally) 
the IO chipset releases the CPU and sets the EPP timeout bit high.
A small number of IO chipsets do not have the EPP timeout function hence if 
there is no EPP device then the CPU is permantly in the HALT state and nothing 
happens LITERALLY! <CNTL><ALT><DEL> does not even function! The bulk (if not 
all) the IO chipsets in this category fail the bug check test, as a result it 
is assumed there is no EPP (or to dangerous to use). This may prevent some 
valid chipsets working properly.
If you have a desktop machine that you can open the case, you could help me by 
locating the IO chipset and send me the details. I will need to know the 
manufactuer and part number. The manufacturers I know about are SMC, National 
Semiconductor and Win Bond (these companies make pdf technical spec files 
publicly available). From this information it is possible to locate the 
configuration registers that the mainboard BIOS uses to read the parallel port 
state. It is a lot cleaner and safer than performing the "black magic" that is 
currently used.
