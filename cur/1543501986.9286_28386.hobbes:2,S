That needs exceptions. You will have a fairly bad time trying to handle
C++ exceptions in the Linux kernel (apart from the giant table size g++ 
outputs you have to deal with interrupts, re-entrant exception handling and
the like - and of course you have to handle running out of memory in the
exception handler (yes this last one is foul in C too))

Writing mainstream kernel code in C++ would IMHO be crazy. Allowing people
to write C++ modules seems to be quite reasonable.
