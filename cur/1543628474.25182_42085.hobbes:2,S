Hi,
having thought about this problem for a day or so, I don't think this is
a kernel issue. One cannot simply solve typical userland problems in the
OS. The only proper way to solve this is for apps to check that fd 0 1 2
are open before they open any file or try to write to any of those fd's.
Maybe the code that is executed before main is called can perform these
checks, but certainly not a kernel...
Guess that from now on app developers will have to do even more checking
on their environment before they use it...
