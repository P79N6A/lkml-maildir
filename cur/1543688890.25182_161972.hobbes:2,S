Retroactively changing a commit message may be a dangerous precedent. While
there may be legitimate reasons (E.g. plain wrong comments or `actually this
part was not written by x but by y'), one day The Evil Empire may claim we
changed the evidence of who did what.
Putting comments under revision control is another option, but may be too
deep-involving...

when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
