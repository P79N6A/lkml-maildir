Hmm...is this with or without DMA?
If it's with DMA, perhaps we should increase the size of the RX buffer
to compensate for moving the DMA RX code into tasklet context?
If it's without DMA, something very strange is going on -- the non-DMA
RX code is almost the only thing left in the hardirq handler, so I
would really expect overruns to be much less likely to occur now than
before...
