I believe the problem is like this: assume you have three timers,
10msec polling of mouse, 30msec keyboard autorepeat and 50msec cursor
blinking. With current approach, you get
10msec userland runs
<enter kernel>
<process mouse>
<process keyboard>
<process cursor>
<exit kernel>
With hires timers, you get:
3msec userland runs
<enter kernel>
<process mouse>
<exit kernel>
2msec userland runs
<enter kernel>
<process keyboard>
<exit kernel>
...
which is not so efficient. I guess rounding could be implemented to
preserve this "do-all-together" ability?
