This does not match my experience building SDRAM based embedded systems. 
Initialising SDRAM simply tells the chips what CAS latency to use, and 
does not erase the contents. SDRAM is fully functional before you have 
written to every cell.
It's possible that JEDEC standards recommend that boot firmware should 
erase the contents, and it is certainly necessary to erase before 
enabling ECC or parity error detection.
