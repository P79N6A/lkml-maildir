'K, here's the deal.
I have a Pentium III 933/133 (Coppermine, stepping 6) in an Intel-manufactured i810 motherboard (hey, I know it's a lame chipset, but it was on sale).  On boot, the kernel (version 2.4.6-pre8) identifies and maps the IO-APIC onboard, but does not assign any IRQs to it.
The relevant boot log snippet follows.
[root@fortytwo i386]# cat /var/log/dmesg
 ...
 ...
mapped APIC to ffffe000 (0121c000)
Kernel command line: auto BOOT_IMAGE=linux-test ro root=307 BOOT_FILE=/boot/vmlinuz-2.4.6-pre8 devfs=mount pirq=9,4
PIRQ redirection, working around broken MP-BIOS.
... PIRQ0 -> IRQ 9
... PIRQ1 -> IRQ 4
 ...
 ...
And /proc/interrupts:
[root@fortytwo i386]# cat /proc/interrupts
           CPU0
  0:      79409          XT-PIC  timer
  1:       5911          XT-PIC  keyboard
  2:          0          XT-PIC  cascade
  4:        990          XT-PIC  es1371
  8:          1          XT-PIC  rtc
  9:      26402          XT-PIC  usb-uhci, serial
 11:      16473          XT-PIC  i810@PCI:0:1:0
 14:       5152          XT-PIC  ide0
 15:         47          XT-PIC  ide1
NMI:          0
ERR:          0
MIS:          0
[root@fortytwo i386]# 
This problem also occurs when booting without the pirq switch. I've configured everything the way it's mentioned in Documentation/i386/IO-APIC.txt, but it doesn't help.  Anyway, thx in advance for the help.
