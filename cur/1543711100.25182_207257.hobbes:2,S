Nod -- kernel internal calls should _especially_ be type-explicit, not 
typeless ioctl-like APIs.

What I'm saying is, emd needs to be submitted to the kernel just like 
Neil Brown submits patches to Andrew, etc.  This is how everybody else 
submits and maintains Linux kernel code.  There needs to be N patches, 
one patch per email, that successively introduces new code, or modifies 
existing code.
Absent of all other issues, one huge patch that completely updates md 
isn't going to be acceptable, no matter how nifty or well-tested it is...
