Hi
How big could a user land stack be on Linux? I
understand that the stack pointer grows donward from
3GB(typically).
How much can it grow downward? Can I control the size
of the stack? What is the default size of the stack?
If I outgrow this, do I get a segv? Is this
information i.e. (lowest stack address permissible)
available via current?
Thanks
