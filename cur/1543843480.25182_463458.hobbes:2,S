We don't see such issue before, don't think it's generic. We did have
some devices with _CID, like a pcie root bridge claims pnp0a03 (pci root
bridge), but they are really compatible.

I'd prefer don't do ACPI core change in this stage and just workaround
Keith's issue till we find this is really a generic problem.

After we convert acpi core to Linux driver model, we have the
capability. But not sure if this can help Keith.
