Unless you believe higher order pagecache is not restricted to the
pagecache, can we please just stick on topic of fsblock vs higher
order pagecache?

So much handwaving. 1TB machines without "very strange setups"
(where very strange is something arbitrarily defined by you) I guess make
up 0.0000001% of Linux installations.

OK, if you rely on reserve pools, then it is not 1st class support and hence
it is a non-solution to VM and IO scalability problems.

Actually: your code is the one that relies on higher order allocations. Now
you're trying to turn that into an argument against fsblock?

Complely wrong. *I* don't need to do any of that to improve performance.
Actually the VM is well tuned for order-0 pages, and so seeing as I have
sane hardware, 4K pagecache works beautifully for me.
My point was this: fsblock does not preclude your using such measures to
fix the performance of your hardware that's broken with 4K pages. And it
would allow higher order allocations to fail gracefully.

Yes you add another layer in the userspace mapping code to handle higher
order pagecache.

I'm not talking about solving your problem of poor hardware. I'm talking
about supporting higher order block sizes in the kernel.

Yes it is you. You brought up reasons in this thread and I said why I thought
they were bogus. If you think you can now forget about my shooting them
down by saying you aren't an expert in filesystems, then you shouldn't have
brought them up in the first place. Either stand by your arguments or don't.

Rubbish. fsblock doesn't touch a single line in the block layer.

Again, rubbish.

Right below this line is where I told you I am _not_ fine with it.

Is that supposed to imply fsblock isn't generic? Or that the fsblock
API isn't a good one?

Neither does fsblock.
