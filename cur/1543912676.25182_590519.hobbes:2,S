Robert Day,
        If I can interpret what you are asking about and changing it abit.
        Don't you think that Maturity can be defined ALSO, as the 
       number of known bugs and their priority / serverity against a 
       architecture dependent or independent item?
       Would this suffice and wouldn't it be easier to maintain?
