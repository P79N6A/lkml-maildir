We are developing a kernel module which needs a task to be done with a 1
millisecond resolution.
-  Is there any way to  change the frequency of the timer interrupt  up to
1kHz,  or install a fast timer interrupt  to be done at 1kHz and keep the
usual 100 Hz timer interrupt for processes? Or do we need to use a
real-time kernel like RT Linux?
- Is there (somewhere on the net ) any example of copying structured memory
(for example a linked list) between kernel and user space using
copy_to_user and copy_from_user?
Thanks
