It now has nonseekable_open() to call.

This is the reason - plus better enforcement of pread/pwrite return
values. Any code touching file->f_pos in a driver is generally broken
anyway. It doesn't prevent such use but it makes the default behaviour
for a driver correct so makes it easier to write drivers correctly
