If the coding style is an obstacle to understanding, it has to be fixed if
there is going to be any kind of review. Besides, nitpicks being simple to
address, they could as well be fixed while at it. Perhaps that way the
author learns to do it right, and less nitpicks are left in later additions
and fixes.
