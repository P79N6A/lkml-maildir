Hi folks,
This is cross post on xine-devel and linux-kernel lists. 
Some xine guys are aware of my experiments comparing multimedia
performance in latest kernels (2.4.x and 2.5.x), so instead of preparing
a lengthy email i've just put a page with it.
At this text i present a dummy multimedia simulator which pretends to be
a video player and measures the number of frames that would be dropped
(and also the mean latency). I used ConTest script to generate the
background loads and take some interesting results.
I hope this will be useful not only to improve xine but also kernel
support in general for any other multimedia player.

Any comments, flames, etc are apreciated (that is, not the flames :)
l-k people, please cc me, i'm not subscribed.
regards,
Miguel Freitas
