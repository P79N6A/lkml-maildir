Wait, you realize that the EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL vs. EXPORT_SYMBOL
bit doesn't mean a damn thing with respect to the license,
right?  The source code in entirety is licensed under the GPL.
 From my point of view, the _only_ difference between the uses
of the two macros is that the "EXPORT_SYMBOL" macro states
that the developer who last touched that code either:
     o  Has no plans to sue anyone who infringes on their code
     o  Thinks that the interface is so common and so generic
        that a lawsuit would be stupid.
Such a labeling is _only_ a bit of advice and a technical
warning, nothing else.  It can be removed or added without any
issue, as long as you obey the GPL license.  If somebody
disagrees and sues you over it, that's a problem between you
and your lawyers.

Umm, according technically to many interpretations of the GPL,
you can't link anyways unless you're GPL, so such labels are
just advice, and have no major legal bearing.

Please cut the worthless rhetoric and irrelevant statements and
either discuss useful information or stop posting.
