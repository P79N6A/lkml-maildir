The setup code leaves a bit to be desired, but for the purpose of
kswapd and the page allocator they are fine.

I don't agree, there are times when you need to know the bare pages_xxx
watermark, and times when you need to know the whole ->protection thing.

OK I dont disagree that your setup calculations are much nicer, and
the current ones are pretty broken...

But please no wholesale replacement of the ->pages_xxx / ->protection
thing unless you really show it is needed (which I'm pretty sure it
isn't). alloc_pages is very nice right now ;)
