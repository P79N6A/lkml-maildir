There is no bug. A virtual console is created by the simple act
of opening it. (By symmetry one would perhaps expect that closing
it for the last time would destroy it again, but that doesnt work
so well because the user may want to read what is there.
So, there is an ioctl to deallocate a virtual console.)
What you describe means that X opens the VT you switch to
and thus creates it if it wasnt there yet.
Note that console switching under X is something done by X,
while console switching in text mode is done by the kernel
keyboard/console driver.
