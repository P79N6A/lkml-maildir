Eric,
I have a patch set available for kexec for 2.5.65.  I have checked it on
a 2-way system and it worked as expected.  There were no changes
required, and the previous version of kexec-tools worked without
modification.
The patches are available for download from OSDL's patch lifecycle
manager ( 
http://www.osdl.org/cgi-bin/plm/
 ).

        optional change to defconfig (sets CONFIG_KEXEC=y):

The patches are also available (with matching kexec-tools-1.8) from this
