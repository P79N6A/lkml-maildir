I just looked a little more, and the notes gcc generates on x86_64 are only 4
byte aligned. (.note.ABI-tag)
The linux kernel gcc, gdb.  I think that is enough to say that notes need to
be 4 byte aligned on Linux.   The core ELF spec also calls out 4 byte alignment
(although it does not mention ELFCLASS64).
I think the evidence is that someone intended to the alignment to go to 8 bytes
with the move to 64bits but it did not catch on in the real world.
So yes I believe the evidence is quite strong that the spec is wrong. 
(Not on some rare platforms certainly but in general).
