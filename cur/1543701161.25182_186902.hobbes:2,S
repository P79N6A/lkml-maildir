Let me put forth a thought, without a solution. In the case you
describe, what is needed, and not provided in hardware, is a way to do
priority within the CPU, so in the case of a contested resource there is
a way to ensure the process we wish wins.
Since that seems unavailable in Intel, do other CPUs do better (or
different)?
