	[Venkatesh Ramamurthy]  Just think an end-user fuguring out this!!!!
Asking him to change PCI slots and trying it out. My point is the end user
should not worry about all this. All he does is plugs a new different/ same
type of card, and gets it going. Why should the linux kernel force the user
to change the PCI slots. Will this not make it more user - unfriendly
