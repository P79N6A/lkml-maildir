Subject: [PATCH] Workaround for AMD762MPX "mouse" bug
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

AMD has published a new errata sheet for the AMD762, which describes
the root cause of the infamous "AMD 762 unstable when no PS/2 mouse
connected" bug. The reason is that without a PS/2 mouse the BIOS doesn't
put a data page in front of the VGA buffer at 640K. When the kernel
puts a page cache page there and does busmaster IO with it then the automatic
PCI prefetch from the chipset can hit the VGA buffer and that may cause a hang.
The workaround is to reserve the page directly before 640K if it wasn't
already reserved by the BIOS.
The bug only occurs in newer revisions (B0,B1)
The workaround here is somewhat hackish. We can only reserve the page
in early boot, but at that time there is no easy way to check for the
AMD762's PCI-ID because the PCI subsystem hasn't been initialized yet.
This patch checks later during the pci quirks pass instead
and then tells the user to pass a kernel option - "vgaguard" - in
case of instability. This is not ideal, but probably preferable than
to connect PS/2 mouses to all boxes in a colocated rack. Another
way would be to always reserve that page, but I didn't feel like
punishing everybody just for a hardware bug in a single chipset.
Patch for 2.5.53. Please consider applying.
