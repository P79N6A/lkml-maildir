The reason for doing load balancing on every exec is that, as you say,
it is cheap to do the balancing at this point - no cache state, minimal
memory allocations.  If we did not balance at this point and relied on
balancing from the timer tick, there would be much more movement of 
established processes between nodes, which is expensive.  Ideally, the
exec balancing is good enough so that on a well functioning system there
is no inter-node balancing taking place at the timer tick.  Our testing
has shown that the exec load balance code does a very good job of
spreading processes across nodes, and thus, very little timer tick
balancing.  The timer tick internode balancing is there as a safety
valve for those cases where exec balancing is not adequate.  Workloads
with long running processes, and workloads with processes that do lots
of forks but not execs, are examples.
An earlier version of Erich's initial load balancer provided for
the option of balancing at either fork or exec, and the capability
of selecting on a per-process basis which to use.  That could be
used if workloads that do forks with no execs become a problem on
NUMA boxes.
