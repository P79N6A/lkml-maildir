That is unavoidable in _any_ scheme. The hotplug spawn scheme wishes
to weasle through this by letting kmalloc determine, when to throw away
an event. No system can process an infinite amount of events.
What's important is an ability to report loss of events and to export
a consistent view of devices connected, that can be read at will.
