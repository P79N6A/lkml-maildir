Understand, but arch already has wads of duplicate code and constants ;)

Did you check how things are set up on a Linux system?
On RH6.0, sys/mman.h includes bits/mman.h, and so references no kernel
code at all.  On RH5.2, sys/mman.h includes linux/mman.h, which in turn
includes asm/mman.h.
Either way a common location for these constants seems desireable.  If
there are platform-specific differences you can always provide a default
set of constants in include/linux, and override them with arch-specific
code if need be.
