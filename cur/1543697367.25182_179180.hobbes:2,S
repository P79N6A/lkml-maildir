It is, though.  If you run out of space copying a file, you know it when 
you're copying.  Applications don't usually expect to get out-of-space 
errors while overwriting something in the middle of a file.
In effect, your free space and your used space add up to greater than 
the capacity of the disk.  An application that checks for free space 
before doing something would be fooled into thinking there is more free 
space than there really is.  How can an application find out in advance 
that a file that it's about to modify (without appending anything to the 
end) is going to need more disk space?
