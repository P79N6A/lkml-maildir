Well... I've once encountered this kind of problem while porting
the kerneli patch (loopback encryption, ...) and thought it is 
a problem of the kerneli patch. I've never thought about the 
possibility that this problem even occurs without encryption.
The other issue is: I wasn't able to reproduce this problem either :(
