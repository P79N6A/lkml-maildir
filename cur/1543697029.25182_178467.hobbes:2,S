There is quite a simple difference in -XX kernel and a distro-patch. People
have to actively decide to use some patched kernel for whatever their reason
may be. A distro on the other hand floods the average user with patched
versions _without_ the users' active decision.
Please keep in mind that a lot of users are not capable of compiling/installing
a new kernel. Those who are have a free decision, those who are not have simply
no choice.
