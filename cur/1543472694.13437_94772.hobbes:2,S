I am trying to put 802.1Q VLAN capability into the kernel, and
have hit a question I'm having trouble muddling through.
The problem is:  How do I allow a user to programatically add
and/or delete VLAN devices after the machine boots.  I think
I have some method calls that will do the trick, but they
are in the kernel, not user-space.  (These VLAN devices will
act very much like Ethernet Devices, but of course since they
are only in software, it is impossible to probe for them at
boot, as the Ethernet devices are probed and created.)
This is probably a fairly detailed and complex question, so I
would really like a pointer to some other code that does
something similar.
Thanks a heap!
Ben
