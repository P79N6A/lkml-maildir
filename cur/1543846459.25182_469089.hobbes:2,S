Questionable because changes to hcd->state aren't synchronized with the
driver.  In this case it probably doesn't end up making any difference.
Removing "regs &&" might change other aspects too.  For instance, does 
this routine ever get called from a timer routine, where regs would 
normally be NULL?  In such situations removing "regs &&" would reverse 
the sense of the test.
