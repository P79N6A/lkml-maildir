As the mixing takes place at the lowest possible block, it's
exceptionally difficult to trigger this. Possible, but exceptionally
difficult.
As I have stated repeatedly, the guarantees can be made but potential
hugepage allocation did not justify it. Large blocks might.

We (Andy Whitcroft and I) did implement something like that. It hooked into
kswapd to clean mixed blocks. If the caller could do the cleaning, it
did the work instead of kswapd.

It happens regularly if the size of the block you need to keep clean is
lower than min_free_kbytes. In the case of hugepages, that was always
the case.

Freeing pages is not cheap. Copying pages is cheaper but not cheap.

They are. The Memory Compaction patches were able to do the job.

To move pages, there must be enough blocks free. That is where
min_free_kbytes had to come in. If you cared only about keeping 64KB
chunks free, it makes sense but it didn't in the context of hugepages.

Ok. It's a bit fairer if we pick two orders that are commonly used then.
order-0 for almost everything and order-4 for a hypothetical large block

It's from a real kernel. When I was measuring this stuff, I took a

It wasn't grouping by mobility at the time.

With strict eviction, there would be no mixed blocks period.
