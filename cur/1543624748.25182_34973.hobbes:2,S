Hello,
since I do only get very few testing results recently, I would all
people reading this and using machines with SiS VGA devices (especially
laptops) kindly ask to test the current versions of the X driver as well
as the kernel framebuffer driver available at
http://www.webit.com/tw/linuxsis630.shtml
 and to report the results
(including logs).
I got only one machine for testing, so I need your help!
Thomas
