Swap serves another (often underrated) purpose: Graceful degradation.
If you have a reasonably amount of swap space mounted, you will know
you are running out of RAM because your system will become noticeably
slower. If you have no swap whatsoever, your first warning will quite
possibly be an application OOM killed or losing data due to a failed
memory allocation.
Think of the slowness of swap as a _feature_.
