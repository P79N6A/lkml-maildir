The size is the amount of code to checksum / 512. It must be at least
1.
Offset 3, the start of initialization code, must not destroy registers:
	DS, ES, SS, SP, SI, DI, or BX.
You initialize whatever you want then, after restoring registers,
end with a 'FAR' return.
The checksum is a byte checksum, starts with zero and wraps. The
result is that the entire length of code must checksum to 0.
Contact me via private email if you need more help.
