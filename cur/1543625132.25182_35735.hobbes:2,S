o       There is more 'memory' I/O space. Therefore you are more likely
        to have enough space for your device when other boards are
        installed. IOTW, you may find that there is no I/O space allocated
        because there isn't any available.
o       Memory address space I/O is faster on Intel Machines. You can
        write or read whole buffers of I/O space in memory address space.
        the best you can do in port space is one long-word at a time.
o       PCI posted writes work when accessing memory-address I/O space.
        Port I/O space cannot do this. The FIFO is written immediately
        before any other access is allowed. This improves the access
        speed in certain circumstances.
Basically, if you have a choice, it's hands-down to use memory-mapped
I/O space.
