The thing depends on what sort of error you get ? Mostly the errors
are Kernel Bug at line no <xx> in <file_name>, Kernel Panic, Out of
Memory or Segmentation Fault which can make your system halt or might
crash kernel or some of your applications, then you have to send the
error log/messages which comes after the error message and these are
called OOPS Messages, for better understanding just look at
Documentation/oops-tracing.txt (or
http://lxr.linux.no/source/Documentation/oops-tracing.txt
) or search
google for OOPs messages !

The log portion you send here is not actually a error, its just
telling you that program ddcprobe is using some symbols which are
marked as deprecated (with in the code) and will be removed (for each
deprecated message related to kernel actually ask you to report it to
linux-kernel mailing list)
