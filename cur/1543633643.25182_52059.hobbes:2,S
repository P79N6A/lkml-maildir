Yes, that is fine.

The vmalloc() sleeps and by the time you get control back you are executing 
on a different CPU. Ooops. The only valid way of treating per-cpu data is:
- disable preemption
- get the cpu number = START OF CRITICAL SECTION: no sleep/schedule allowed
- do work using the cpu number
- reenable preemption = END OF CRITICAL SECTION
The only thing that could possibly be used inside the critical region is 
kmalloc(GFP_ATOMIC) but we are allocating 64kiB so that is not an option. 
(It would fail very quickly due to memory fragmentation, the order of the 
allocation is too high.)

True it does, but unfortunately it doesn't work. )-:
