As I asked for in your bugzilla.kernel.org filing, what does the kernel
log showing?  Is there lots of USB activity?  Are there any USB devices
plugged into the system?  Does this also happen for 2.4?  Are you using
ACPI?  (I can go on, but that's a good start.  You need to provide a
much better bug report than this...)
