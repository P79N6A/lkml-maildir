I've noticed this on all kernels and it seems scheduling related
hence why the latest triggers it for you. As far as I can see
most times writing data to gnome-terminal WHICH CAUSES IT TO SCROLL
it takes a ridiculous amount of time. If I take some CPU time away
from gnome-terminal by the official "window wiggling" method it
runs much faster. Note it's not rendering (antialiasing) related
as I turned that off with the same effect.
