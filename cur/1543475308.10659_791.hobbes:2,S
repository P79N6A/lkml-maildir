Hi Peter,
I have an idea for a new kind of mirror. Since 90% of all
downloads probably are the newest kernel only, we might
want to setup a very large latest-only mirror network
where we distribute files by rsync so all mirrors have
the latest kernel source immediately.
I think that would rid us of the lack of mirrors (who can't
spare 50 megs on his/her server?) and of the kernel.org
overloading (since the rsync mechanism makes sure that all
mirrors have the latest files within an hour or so).
An yes, I volunteer to be one of those light-weight mirrors.
My network connection is fast and mostly idle, but my disk
space is quite limited...
cheers,
