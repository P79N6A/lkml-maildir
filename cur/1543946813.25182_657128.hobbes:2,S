Hi Ingo,
Should we change above condition also to something like following.
kernel_phys_start = __pa(__START_KERNEL_map) + phys_base
kernel_phys_end = kernel_phys_start + KERNEL_TEXT_SIZE
if (__pa(address) >= kernel_phys_start
	&& __pa(address) <= kernel_phys_end)  
Looks like we are trying to see if a physical page has been mapped
by kernel text/data region also then change the caching attributes there too.
In case of relocatable kernel, not necessarily first 40MB will be mapped by
the kernel text/data region, If boot loader decides to load kernel
at a higher address and phys_base is non-zero.
Thanks
Vivek
