This is exactly what's supposed to be happening, but the code is buggy
and nobody noticed :-) (I'm mixing up IORESOURCE_* flags and
PCI_COMMAND_* flags). Thanks for reviewing !

No need for 2 calls, just disable whatever type the resource is, but
using the right bits instead of what my code incorrectly does.

Yes, that's what intended by the above code, if I didn't have mixed up
the flags.
