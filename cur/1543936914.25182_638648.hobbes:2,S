i like this approach better, not the least because it affects only one 
architecture so late in the .24-rc cycle. Instrumentation bugs tend to 
be found with a few weeks/months of delays. (because historically 
instrumentation has been typically used by folks who cannot change their 
kernel easily to debug it, i.e. by extension they dont run bleeding edge 
kernels either.)
