Subject: [Patch 1/3] prefetch the mmap_sem in the fault path
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/2/23/42

In a micro-benchmark that stresses the pagefault path, the down_read_trylock
on the mmap_sem showed up quite high on the profile. Turns out this lock is
bouncing between cpus quite a bit and thus is cache-cold a lot. This patch
prefetches the lock (for write) as early as possible (and before some other
somewhat expensive operations). With this patch, the down_read_trylock
basically fell out of the top of profile.
