Does it use that for F_GETLK64 and friends?  klibc overrides the 
definitions so that F_GETLK is really F_GETLK64 etc; thus, "struct 
flock" in klibc userspace is really "struct flock64".  (To put it 
differently, klibc is always large-file compliant.)
As far as I can tell, MIPS uses the generic definition for struct 
flock64, which is the one I have above, so it should be correct.
