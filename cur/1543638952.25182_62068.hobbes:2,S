In different kernels I've seen this message:
Aug  6 19:10:01 localhost pppd[32497]: Unsupported protocol 'CallBack
Control Protocol (CBCP)' (0xc029) received
Is pppd who has to handle this protocol, or it's a "ToDo" in ppp in the
kernel? In the last case, will it be implemented?
and, what's the hell is the "Callback Protocol?"
