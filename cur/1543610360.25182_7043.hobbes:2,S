Having it is supposed to improve performance. If you take two identical 
machines, and enable swap on one but not the other, the first machine should 
have better performance: it can cache the FS more effectively.
Now, if you have INSANE amounts of RAM (i.e. enough to have everything 
running in RAM *AND* every file you access cached) the swap will make no 
difference at all. Under any other circumstances, it should make things 
better.
