Perhaps not a bit, but rather another enumerated value in the type field
of an inode.  (Are there any values left?)
Ok, lets consider this.  Suppose that /a/b and /a/c both refer to the same
directory, where /a/b is a traditional link, but /a/c is a "hardlink".
What happens when one executes 'rmdir /a/b'?  Does the directory it
references disappear?  If not, how would tar ever find it?  (I have
this vision of a disk full of these hardlink-only directories which
tar and perhaps fsck cannot find.)
