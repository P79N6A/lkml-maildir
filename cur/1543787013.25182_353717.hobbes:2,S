As I noted when creating mqueues with sys_open() the umask is set
correctly just by the code you pointed out. But sys_mq_open() doesn't use
open_namei() nor filp_open(); the reason is extra data - mq_attr - that
must be passed to real mqueue creating code. So the invocation path is:
sys_mq_open() -> do_create() -> vfs_create() -> (vfs create handler)
mqueue_create().
After rereading it I think that the better place for the line setting
umask is do_create() function as it will be on the same level as
open_namei(). I hope this change will clarify things.
If this make sense I'll send a patch.
Best regards
