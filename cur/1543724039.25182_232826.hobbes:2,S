Hello,
Got this one working :
LILO: linux init=/sbin/sulogin /dev/ttyS0
It finally asked me to enter root password, I did my maintenance, 
and then...
/sbin/reboot did nothing
leaving the shell (exit) said :
Attempting to kill init
Panic, will reboot in 30 seconds.
(or something like that), but it didn't restart, and I had to reboot
the machine...
Is this the expected behaviour ?
Regards,
Paul
