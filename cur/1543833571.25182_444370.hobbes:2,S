Ok, it really looks like EFI is broken. You said that "ACPI_MCFG table
returns e0000000", ie we should find the config space thing there, yet:

It clearly wasn't there..
However, it looks like your conversion is a bit buggy:

The above is missing the "RT_data" thing (which was there in your input):
	mem31: type=6, attr=0x800000000000000f, range=[0x000000007eeff000-0x000000007ef00000) (0MB)

I think that should be a "default:", to make sure that you don't have any 
memory region types that get ignored. Because it looks like you missed the 
EFI_RUNTIME_SERVICES_CODE/EFI_RUNTIME_SERVICES_DATA ones at a minimum (an 
dmaybe others - I didn't check).
Anyway, that won't fix your bug, and yes, it sounds like you should add a 
PCI_PROBE_FORCE_MMCFG flag (and then do the proper MMIO region reservation 
to make sure that we don't allocate over it when allocating PCI 
resources).
Looks good otherwise.
