It's ok: sk->data_ready is never null, but nlk_sk(sk)->data_ready will be 
null unless an input function is provided there.

Netlink sockets created by netlink_kernel_create() do not subscribe to any 
groups and are not broadcast to.

Agreed, it's not really harmful, but it's sloppy.  Better to let the
application know that it can't send to the socket rather than let it keep
sending (with successful return codes) until the kernel socket buffer 
fills up.
