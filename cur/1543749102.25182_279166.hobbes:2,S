I just had a talk about the slab allocator.
You can find my slides at 
http://krohlas.de/
They are in German, but the last slide contains all sources which
are mainly available online and are written in English.
I hope this will help you.
Btw: is anybody working on the slab allocator as described in Bonwicks
2001 paper?
