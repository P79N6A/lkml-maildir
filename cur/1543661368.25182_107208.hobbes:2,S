So use a pseudo-file-system which lets you store 8-bit data on such a
device storing only 7-bit data. 
It's no less sensible than taking a real flash device and hacking up a
pseudo-file-system which makes it pretend to be a block device, then
using a 'normal' file system on top of that. 
It's just a shame that CF doesn't generally give you real access to the
underlying flash and let you use a real file system designed for the
purpose rather than its silly 'translation layer' :)
