I said before and originally, in response to the original post by you, 
that i didn't need acpi p-states driver, which is what this thread was 
suggesting.  We later determined that the thread title was misleading, 
this thread should be titled   "Kconfig powernow-k8 driver should depend 
on ACPI_PROCESSOR driver"
I've always compiled acpi_processor in the kernel, i use acpi, i have a 
processor, it seemed to fit.

My patch does the most intelligent thing thus far, it lets the user 
decide.  If the user is smart enough to enable cpufreq's powernow-k8 
driver, then the user is smart enough to decide if he wants/needs to use 
the acpi support of that driver.    I'm just exposing the driver that is 
causing all of this confusion to the user, since this is the driver that 
gets enabled/disabled behind the scenes depending on acpi_processor 
being selected.  Now it's not automatically handled, the user can enable 
acpi support or disable it (in the powernow driver), even if 
acpi_processor is compiled in.
you should be able to use the acpi support of Powernow-k8 even in UP 
situations, so only enabling it for SMP is wrong.  Enabling it whenever 
you have acpi compiled in and acpi_processor compiled in is wrong, 
because the user may be using a UP system and not want to lookup the 
acpi tables for powernow for some ungodly reason.   Just allowing the 
user to handle it works best.  See my previous post for the patch.
