I think this is a very different philosophy.  That's "well, this should
be a spinlock, but sometimes we sleep, and we don't want to think about
it too hard, so let's invent a magical lock".  This is "sometimes we
don't hold semaphores for very long so we can improve performance by
spinning 1000 times before sleeping".
