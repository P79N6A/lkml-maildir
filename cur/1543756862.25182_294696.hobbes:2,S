You're right. The IBM trackpoints unfortunately don't have a 'native'
mode, they always do full processing and send classic PS/2 packets.
I think we shouldn't need a handler, since we can use the PS/2 protocol
one. We'll need some options to set the trackpoint tap behavior (as far
as I know it can only be mapped to a button), and we'll need a safe
detection, but that's all.
