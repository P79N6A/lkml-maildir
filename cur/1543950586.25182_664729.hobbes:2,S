Hi,
I'm trying to compare the performance of some networking code 
(throughput and latency when receiving various volumes of UDP streams) 
between a preemptible and non-preemptible 2.6.24 kernel, and was 
wondering if it is possible to temporarily disable preemption on a 
running preemptible kernel.  Is it just a matter of loading a module 
which calls preempt_enable() at load and preempt_disable() at unload - 
or is that too naive?  Is there an existing way of doing this?
thanks,
Matthew.
