I must say I really dislike immediate_if(). You complained earlier
that something breaks coloring, but adding such macros will definitely
break a lot of editors (especially if you use it without {} like here)
It would be much nicer and readable to just use if 
(unlikely(immediate_read(&x)) or if you prefer to hide the unlikely
if (immediate_bool_test(&x)) with an implicit unlikely().
