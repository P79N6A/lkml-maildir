 Yes, you can.  And it makes sense for bad block remapping.  Zip disks
deteriorate gradually when used heavily.  I had a problem with one of them
-- one of tracks was unreliable and the drive tried to recover it upon
writes.  The symptoms were such that some sectors were being marked as bad
and after a following write they were marked as good again.  The drive was
able to read them but needed to recalibrate for a few times to achieve it,
which resulted in these sectors being marked as bad again as a side
effect.  And so on. 
 After formatting the disk, the whole track became marked as bad and I had
no problems with the particular disk ever since.  It seems whole track
remapping is performed only upon formatting which is reasonable.
