Oh, of course. I already wrote the same thing yesterday.
But for now I would like to hear whether Jens and Clemens
have objections. If not, or after resolving any objections,
this patch can be fragmented in small independent chunks.
[I still hope Jari will be willing to do that - it is mostly
his stuff - but if not I'll do it.]
