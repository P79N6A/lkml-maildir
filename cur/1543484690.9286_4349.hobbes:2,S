     In the documentation for framebuffers in the fb directory it states 
that the devices fb0-fb7 can be created with Major 29 and Minor 0-224 by 
steps of 32.  The devices.txt states that fb7 should be Major 29 Minor 
240.  I do not know if the devices.tex contains the same error, because 
I didn't look, but I assume it is likely.  I know its not really a big 
error, but some people may just use the devices file for a quick 
reference instead of looking at the specific documentation.
