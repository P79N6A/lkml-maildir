parisc arch Makefile needs some love and care...
The logic selecting CROSS_COMPILE seems fishy and wrong -
the error reported by rday is obvious in this respect.
FINAL_LD is unused - kill it.
Building with oldpalo has been broken for a loong time - time to kill it?
Hint - the "cd ../palo" is not working as expected.
And use of TOPDIR is deprecated.
The libs-y assignment should learn from the other architectures how to
get the gcc lib filename:
$(shell $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -print-libgcc-file-name)
And this snippet is also wrong:
PALO := $(shell if which palo; then : ; \
	elif [ -x /sbin/palo ]; then echo /sbin/palo; \
	fi)
palo: vmlinux
	@if [ -x $PALO ]; then \
Make does not export variables so $PALO is not the same as $(PALO).
The latter should be used.
I did not supply a patch because I do not fully understand the
logic behind setting CROSS_COMPILE and 64BIT or not.
But I will be happy to review a patch to fix the issues in the
parisc Makefile.
