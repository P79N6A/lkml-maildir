Adding yet another member to the already bloated tcp_sock structure to
implement this is too high a cost.
I would instead prefer that there be some global random number
calculated when the first TCP socket is created, and use that as a
global offset.  You can even recompute it every few hours if you
like.
We do similar things already elsewhere.
