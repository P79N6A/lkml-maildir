CVS.  It's the most widely used system in the world, it has problems but you
can work around those problems, the FreeBSD guys are all in CVS and so is
Mozilla.  
When the day comes that you want to move out, we can import your history
perfectly, you can't see the boundary where CVS stopped and BK started.
