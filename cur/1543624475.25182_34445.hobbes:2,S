You can call functions and touch data in other functions ... the kernel
image, even with modules, is one big flat monolithic model.
You will probably want to EXPORT_SYMBOL the functions and variables you
want to touch ... see other modules.  But basically you can access
anything that is exported once your module is linked.
Carefully consider _why_ you need "inter-module communication",
though... and design to those (hopefully proper) goals.
