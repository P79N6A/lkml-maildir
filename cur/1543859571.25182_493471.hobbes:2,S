Nope, let's leave that there for a couple of kernel cycles, give people  
to catch up.
It's fairly common for non-developers to download and build out-of-tree code from
random websites.  Let's not break their build unless we really need to.  In this
case there's little cost to us in giving the developers of that out-of-tree code
time to do an update.
