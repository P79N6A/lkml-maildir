"cached" includes the "swap cache", a mechanism which is used when we
get a read memory access to a page of swapped memory.  When that
happens, we pull in the page from disk but we don't remove that copy on
disk --- the copy in memory becomes effectively a local cache of the
disk copy, and counts as cached memory.  If we want to discard that copy
from memory in the future, we can do so without writing it back to disk
because we know that the in-memory copy has not been modified since we
first read it from disk.

No, the swap cache is using both on-disk swap and in-core memory for the
same data, just as the page cache contains an in-core memory copy of
regular files on disk.  That is quite deliberate.
