Well, the output below anwered my question about multiple MSI's from a 
single device :)

So, over time at least, the interrupts have been spread over half the 
cores in the system.  This is where the block diagram showing the socket 
and I/O slot connections would be useful.
For the interrupts over a given interval, one can take snapshots at 
either end of the interval and then run them through beforeafter:

I think that collectl might have something there too.
I guess the addresses in use weren't sufficient to get interrupts spread 
across all 24 IRQ's.
