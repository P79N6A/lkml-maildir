I have an HP Colorado 2.5/5.0 GB IDE ATAPI  tape drive.  When I used the
ide-tape driver in the kernel I saw the exact same error messages.  I have
recently moved over to SCSI emulation for IDE Tape drives.  You can get more
information about this by posting to linux-tape@vger.rutgers.edu.  For what
it's worth I think the problem is with the tape driver and not with the drive.
