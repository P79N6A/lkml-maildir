Everyone on the "trash disk as root" thread seems to be
looking at this as a security issue. It is possible to
consider this as a usability issue as well. This may be
naive, but is it possible for an administrator to attempt to
set parameters incorrectly and trash the disk _without_ an
intent to cause damage. I know that in my own salad (read
green) days as an admin, I occasionally got slapped for
putting my fingers in the wrong place - and this could be a
major size slap :-)
