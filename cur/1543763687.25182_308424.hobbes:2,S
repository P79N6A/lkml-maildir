Herbert,
I also wonder, does it at all correct to use negative windowBits in 
crypto API? I mean, if windowBits is negative, zlib doesn't produce the 
proper zstream header, which is incorrect according to RFC-1950. It also 
doesn't calculate adler32.
For example, if we work over an IP network (RFC-2384), the receiving 
side may be confused by such a "stripped" zstream.
Isn't it conceptually right to produce *correct* zstream, with the 
header and the proper adler32 ?
Yes, for JFFS2 we would like to have no adler32, we anyway protect our 
data by CRC32. But I suppose this should be an additional feature.
Comments?
