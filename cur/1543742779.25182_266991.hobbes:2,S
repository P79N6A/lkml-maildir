At first sight that sounds like a plausible explanation, however
the facts in my case suggest something else is going on:
My laptop's framebuffer is only 800x600x24bpp VESA, or 1406kB.
But look at what X is doing:
root       632  6.1 17.5 22024 16440 ?       S    12:05   0:17 X :0
The more apps in use, the more memory is used, but at the moment
I've only got xterm, rxvt, thunderbird, xclock and xload. My wm is
blackbox which is using 5 megs.
Also, just curious but why would memory-mapped I/O be counted
in the memory usage anyway? Shouldn't there be a separate number
for framebuffer memory and the like?

In my experience, most of the flexibility is not necessary for
97% of what I do, yet it evidently costs a lot in memory usage
and speed.
