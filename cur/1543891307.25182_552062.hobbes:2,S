Hmm.  I'm wondering how my signed off by got on this one.
Maybe I did this at some point.
In any case this patch looks wrong (unless I'm completely mistaken)
because it doesn't appear to handle PAE mode.
Which is why I initialized the early page table in C, in my
last round of patches on this subject.
If we don't know the page table format doing this kind of
thing is very difficult.
