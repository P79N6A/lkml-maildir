Yes it could be.
But when I boot the machine I see strange lines:
Advanced Linux Sound Architecture Driver Version 0.9.0rc7 (Sat Feb 15 15:01:21 
2003 UTC).
request_module: failed /sbin/modprobe -- snd-card-0. error = -16
no UART detected at 0xffff
Motu MidiTimePiece on parallel port irq: 7 ioport: 0x378

Dunno, but I can try tomorrow.
