1. The inactive_target is 1 second worth of allocations, minus
   the amount of frees in 1 second, averaged over a minute
2. When the amount of really free pages gets low, a separate
   thread moves inactive_clean pages to the free list (so no
   chance of kswapd not doing this because it's blocked on disk)
regards,
Rik
