I'm not sure that preempt and low latency really are attacking the same
problem. What I am finding is the LL improves overall performance when a
process does something which is physically slow, like a find in a
directory with 20k files. On the other hand PK makes the response of the
system better to changes. In particular I see the DNS servers which have
other work running, even backups or reports, are more responsive with PK,
as are usenet news servers. I find it hard to measure "feels faster" with
either approach, although like the supreme court "I know it when I see
it."
I'd like to hope that some of each will get in the main kernel, PK has
been stable for me for a while, LL has never been unstable but I've run it
less.
