wasteful. We only ever use 2048 bytes of this array, so doubling
its size on 64bit is pointless, unless you make changes later on
in the driver. (Which I think don't make sense, as we just copy
32 64byte chunks).
Ermm, actually this looks totally bogus..
CpqTsGetSFQEntry() ...
    if( total_bytes <= 2048 )
    {
      memcpy( ulDestPtr,
              &fcChip->SFQ->QEntry[consumerIndex],
              64 );  // each SFQ entry is 64 bytes
      ulDestPtr += 16;   // advance pointer to next 64 byte block
    }
we're trashing the last 48 bytes of every copy we make.
Does this driver even work ?
