There have been at least five holes found in pile that _could_ have been
exploited, and even one in all xterms pre X11R6 where ascii+escape codes
was all you needed.
Mutt has had minor things fixed for security reasons too.
It's harder. But you ignore two things - once someone does it anyone can
repeat it - and more importantly almost all exploits rely on user error.
Linux users are not always brighter than windows ones and there isnt a lot
you can do to make them smarter
Think of computer security like powertools. The day you think you are totally
safe is the day you end up hurt.
