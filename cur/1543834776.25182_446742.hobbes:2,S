Hello Ingo,
Finally, I got around to debug this a little bit and I have
figured out why I get this oops. In the oops I see that
I am advancing a list of rcu callbacks to the done list
but the last element of the done list has already been
freed. This made me suspect rcutorture module and I remembered
that rcu_barrier() is a NOP in rcupreempt. In my rcu
code reorganization patchset, I fixed that (rcu_barrier()
is a common primitive on top of both classic and preemptible
rcu). That is why I wasn't seeing the crash with my
patchset applied.
Anyway, the following patch fixes this problem in my
x86_64 box (64-bit kernel) and I can run rcutorture.
However, I would request not applying this for the moment
since this would get fixed in the RCU cleanup that
is to follow. I am working on your suggestion at Ottawa of 
merging as much possible in the mainline itself.
The patch below is only for those who want to temporarily work around
this for running rcutorture.
Thanks
Dipankar
