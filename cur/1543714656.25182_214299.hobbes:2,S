Hi,
I'm having problems (since 2.6.3 now trying with 2.6.5).
Main symptom is that my synaptics touchpad isn't detected after a cold
boot. After a warm boot it's detected correctly though.
In the cold boot case I have some weird behaviours loading psmouse:
[...]
 psmouse_probe(): Probing mouse
 psmouse_probe(): sending 0xa5
atkbd.c: Unknown key released (translated set 2, code 0x7a on isa0060/serio0).
atkbd.c: This is an XFree86 bug. It shouldn't access hardware directly.

but XFree86 is not running! (I also added some further debug printks in
psmouse_probe and psmouse_extensions but the latter is never reached)
unloading psmouse also disables the keyboard and prints a flood of

this is /proc/bus/input/devices without synaptics touchpad
