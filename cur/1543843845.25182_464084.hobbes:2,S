Hi all,
I am trying to compile the uCLinux's distribution with enabling the 
'ucdsnmp'.
It will successfully compiled, image and romfs.img is created.
But when i am trying to boot with this image I am getting the following
error message....

VFS: Mounted root (romfs filesystem) readonly.
Freeing init memory: 44K
Warning: unable to open an initial console.

After this it will halts. If i am not enable the 'ucdsnmp' package it
works fine. What is the resean of this .....
