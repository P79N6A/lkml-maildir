Yep, and I reckon that they could port their security module to the
LSM one within one week. I mentioned it to Peter Loscocco at OLS 2001 
at the LSM BOF.

I don't know about GPL and kernel related rights but I can hardly 
imagine a company that has a B1 certified product not to care well
about their other products to be on the right side of the law. I 
can talk to them on thursday about this at the comdex/orbit showcase.
The outcome of your legality statement might be crucial for their 
future business.
BTW, I recall the HP Linux which IMO also violates the GPL then, doesn't
it?

Or does this differ in them providing the source code even for the LKMs
as opposite to argus which has binary only LKMs?

No problem, regards,
