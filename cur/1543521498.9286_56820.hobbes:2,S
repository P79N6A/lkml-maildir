The section 7.1.2.1 (of Intel PIII, Volume III) says that automatic
LOCK-ing is done:
   * When executing an XCHG instruction that references memory.
   * When setting the B (busy) flag of a TSS descriptor. 
   * When updating segment descriptors. 
   * When updating page-directory and page-table entries.
   * Acknowledging interrupts. 
so, inc is *not* one of them. On the next page it mentions cases when LOCK
prefix can be used (all other cases will generate invalid opcode exception):
   * The bit test and modify instructions (BTS, BTR, and BTC).
   * The exchange instructions (XADD, CMPXCHG, and CMPXCHG8B). 
   * The LOCK prefix is automatically assumed for XCHG instruction.
   * The following single-operand arithmetic and logical instructions:
     INC, DEC, NOT, and NEG.
   * The following two-operand arithmetic and logical instructions: ADD,
     ADC, SUB, SBB, AND, OR, and XOR.
I know we all can read and cut'n'paste but sometimes it is nice to find
useful facts in a signle email message :)
