Subject: PATCH: kernel mount of initrd fails unless mke2fs uses 1024 byte  blocks
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Alan, Andries, IBMers,
Here are the documentation patches that relate to the initrd problem I
reported previously.  (The mke2fs command had to specify -b 1024, or it
couldn't be mounted at boot time by the kernel.)  This submission is against
the 2.4.18 kernel.  If they're acceptable, I'll do another one for the
2.2.20 version.
There was a little bit of scope creep here.  :)  The instructions in
linux/Documentation/Configure.help said to run a spell-checker against the
file before submitting any patches for it.  Clearly, that hasn't been done
in a while, so my patch also has miscellaneous spelling corrections in it
for things completely unrelated.  After having spent a couple of hours
wading through the spell checking process, I can understand why it doesn't
get done much.  :(
Finally, there were a couple of Linux/390 items that I thought could be a
little clearer, were wrong, or didn't exist at all.  So, I've also submitted
changes for CONFIG_DASD, CONFIG_DASD_FAST_IO, CONFIG_IUCV, and a completely
new entry for CONFIG_LCS.
I tried to make similar modifications to linux/Documentation/initrd.txt, and
to /usr/man/man4/initrd.4, to try to cover all places someone might look if
they were having the same problem I did.
Please let me know if there's anything I need to correct, modify, whatever.
