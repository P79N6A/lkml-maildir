Thanks.  That is actually the point I want make: although it is
*possible* to do that via VMI ROM, doing that using paravirt_ops is
*better* (no matter whenever the hypervisor is xen or kvm).  Thats why
we actually have it.  The very same discussion a couple months ago came
to  exactly that conclusion.
cheers,
