I refered to creative #defines and such. And re obsolete syntax, egcs is
getting pickier. You can always increase the warning level...

Doing this _right_ would mean to redesign/rewrite the whole kernel from the
ground up. To patch C++ into it just won't cut it, IMO. BTW, C++ and C are
starting to diverge seriously, if I'm not very mistaken from cursory looks
at discussions on C9x and the C++ standard, so to get it to compile as GNU
C or as GNU C++ will get increasingly dificult. And mixed stuff is just an
accident waiting to happen.

The things where this is useful (filesystems and VFS, all sorts of device
drivers) have been taken care of, and the result works fine so far.

C++ _can_ (in the hands of capable designers and programmers) help in this
way. So can C, perhaps with somewhat harder work. Both have the possibility
of creating an unholy mess. Perhaps C++ more than C as things stand today
(shifting standard, incomplete adherence to whatever standards exist, much
less experience working around the language's limitations).

All this is what makes C++ useful: Just as C, C++ is mostly libraries. And
the "ridiculously most complex new standard" has been created exactly for
the sake of really enabling OO design in C++, and making the language safer
(for me, the jury is still out on these...). So if you don't use them, you
can stay with C and don't feel much difference.
