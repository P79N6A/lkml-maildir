Ok...so I'll try to find one in 2.6.22.5:
grundler <1855>find -name \*.c | xargs fgrep DEFINE_PER_CPU | fgrep atomic_t
./arch/s390/kernel/time.c:static DEFINE_PER_CPU(atomic_t, etr_sync_word);
grundler <1856>find -name \*.c | xargs fgrep DEFINE_PER_CPU | fgrep local_t
./arch/x86_64/kernel/nmi.c:static DEFINE_PER_CPU(local_t, alert_counter);
uhm, I was expecting more than that.  Maybe there is some other systemic
problem with how PER_CPU stuff is used/declared?
In any case, some references to LTT usage would be quite helpful.
E.g. a list of file and variable names at the end of local_ops.txt file.

Sorry...the quoted text doesn't answer my question. It's a definition
of semantics, not an explanation of the "mechanics".
I want to know what happens when (if?) an interrupt occurs in the
middle of a read/modify/write sequence that isn't prefixed with LOCK
(or something similar for other arches like "store locked conditional" ops).
Stating the semantics is a good thing - but not a substitution for
describing how it works for a given architecture. Either in the code
or in local_ops.txt. Otherwise people like me won't use it because
we don't believe that (or understand how) it really works.

Please add a bit more detail. If DaveM is correct (he normally is), then
there must be limits on how the local_t can be used in the kernel process
and interrupt contexts. I'd like those rules spelled out very clearly
since it's easy to get wrong and tracking down such a bug is quite painful.
Note: I already missed the one critical sentence about only the "owning"
CPU can write the value....there seem to be other limitations as well
with respect to interrupts.

Looks fine to me. Add your "Signed-off-by" and submit to DaveM
since he seems to be the maintainer of atomic_ops.txt.
