Let's add a Choice C:
	Any nodemask that is passed to set_mempolicy() is saved as the
	intent of the application in struct mempolicy.  All policies
	are effected on a contextualized per-allocation basis.
	Policies such as MPOL_INTERLEAVE always get AND'd with 
	pol->cpuset_mems_allowed.  If that yields numa_no_nodes,
	MPOL_DEFAULT is used instead.
	Policies such as MPOL_PREFERRED are respected if the node is set
	in pol->cpuset_mems_allowed, otherwise MPOL_DEFAULT is used.	
	If an application attempts to setup a memory policy for an
	MPOL_PREFERRED node that it doesn't have access to or an
	MPOL_INTERLEAVE nodemask that is empty when AND'd with
	pol->cpuset_mems_allowed, -EINVAL is returned and no new policy
	is effected.
	If an application gains nodes in pol->cpuset_mems_allowed that
	now include the nodes from MPOL_INTERLEAVE or MPOL_PREFERRED,
	that policy is then effected once again.  Otherwise,
	MPOL_DEFAULT is still used.
