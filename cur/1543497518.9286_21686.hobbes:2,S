  From the Changelog.
Some of the changes in this version appeared in 2.2.x-ac kernels but
never made it into the main kernel.
Move code outside the kernel.
Add manual page.
Performance improvements in regular expression processing.
Convert all tabs to spaces on input.  Simplifies and speeds up pattern
matching as well as catching users who hand type Oops using tabs.
Remove CR and nulls from input lines.
Use __insmod symbols when insmod creates them.
Changed the default to short lines, with -S option for users with large
screens.
Changed : to ; in ksymoops output.  Avoids problems when feeding
ksymoops text back into itself.
Remove all stderr, use stdout instead.  Too many users were only
mailing stdout :(.
Added -x toggle, print offsets and lengths in hex or decimal, default
is hex.
Added -a and -t options to allow cross system debugging.
Replace -c code_bytes option with -e.
Sparc and Alpha updates.
Include module name in symbol mappings.
Support for spinlock and sysrq showPc diagnostics.
Major internal rewrite.
Also in /pub/ksymoops are patches to modutils and sysklogd.  The
modutils patch helps ksymoops give much better diagnostics when an Oops
occurs in a module.  The sysklogd patch preserves log information that
ksymoops needs to do its job.
