Subject: [PATCH] Fix PCMCIA card detection
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I'm intending sending Linus the following patch to fix PCMCIA card
detection about 24 hours (on 21:26 GMT on Oct 29th.)  A couple of
people have tested it and reported that it fixes their card detection
problems.  I'd like people _without_ this problem to try the patch
and report if they see any breakages.
Idea from David Hinds.
Some PCMCIA/Cardbus controllers seem to get upset when we ask
them to re-do card interrogation - they miss the next insertion
event.
We therefore avoid forcing needless card interrogations if a
card has already been succesfully detected and interrogated.
