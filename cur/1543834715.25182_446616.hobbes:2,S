This is very interesting in the context of a few discussions I had at 
OLS about klibc; there are people who would like initramfs to be 
accessible *before* device probing is done, so that drivers can access 
firmware and possible hotplug from the initramfs during the driver 
initialization.  We could even invoke (k)init at this point; this would 
require a) having a system call or device that would allow kinit to 
block until device probing was complete, and b) a way to handle 
/dev/console -- there are several different ways to deal with it; it's 
mostly a matter of picking a good one.
Note that we don't need device drivers for userspace -- we only need VM, 
VFS and scheduler initialization.
Multithreaded device initialization is a great idea, especially since 
many devices require delays during initialization, sometimes on the 
order of seconds.
