I'm suggesting the following patch to remove the < 4 :
#define inline as __attribute__((always_inline)) also for gcc >= 3.4
Rationale:
- if gcc 3.4 can't inline a function marked as "inline" that's a
  strong hint that further investigation is required
- I strongly prefer a compile error over a potential runtime problem
