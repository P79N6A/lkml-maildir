There is a better way to report these gfp debugging messages, instead
of grubbing through System/.map by hand.
  sed -ne '/gfp called/{ s/.* /EIP: [</; s/!/>]/p; }' < log | ksymoops
Turns a gfp debugging message into an EIP line which ksymoops will
recognise and automatically decode.
It would be nice if anybody adding these sort of debugging lines also
included a sed script to convert their adhoc debug line into something
that can be automatically decoded.
