Instead of that, what about something like this instead:  NOTE: I  
know my mailer mangles diffs and this one was hand-edited based on  
Jan's diff from within my mailer so it probably doesn't apply, but  
it's enough to point out the idea:
diff --fast -Ndpru linux-2.6.17-rc6~/kernel/Kconfig.hz linux-2.6.17- 
rc6+/kernel/Kconfig.hz
