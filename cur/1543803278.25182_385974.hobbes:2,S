Subject: [GIT PATCH] SPI patches for 2.6.15
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/1/13/439

Here are a few patches for 2.6.15 that add a SPI driver subsystem to the
kernel tree.  All of these patches have been in the -mm tree for a long
time, and David and Vitaly have finally agreed that this code base is
the proper one to work from for future SPI development.
These patches also add a few SPI drivers that use the subsystem, with
more promised to be coming soon.
Please pull from:
	rsync://rsync.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/spi-2.6.git/
or if master.kernel.org hasn't synced up yet:
	master.kernel.org:/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/spi-2.6.git/
The full patches will be sent to the linux-kernel mailing list, if
anyone wants to see them.
thanks,
greg k-h
