Aha. It didn't start the array when I compiled md and raid0 built-in; that's 
how I discovered this.
It works as modules (weird to me, but I'm not a kernel guru)

dig into the init scripts.

I think I have read something about mdadm in Gentoo docs somewhere. I really 
need to check that out.
Thanks Neil.
