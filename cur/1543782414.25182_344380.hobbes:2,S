	That discussion is wrong. The form of the argument is simply invalid.
	Just because an optimization could break things in some cases doesnt mean
the compiler cant ever make the optimization. It just cant make the
optimization in the case that breaks things. And by things I mean things
that are defined in the standard that would be broken, not things outside of
it.
