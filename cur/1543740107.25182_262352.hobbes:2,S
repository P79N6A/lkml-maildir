Are these really "priorities" in real life?  I am not being facetious,
this is actually a common myth among users, that you will get better
performance by putting the device you care about on a "high priority"
irq or tweaking the priorities in your local APIC.  My impression was
that this is pointless because it only determines which interrupt the
CPU sees first if they fire at _exactly_ the same time.  Since we allow
interrupt to nest this does not matter in practice, right?
