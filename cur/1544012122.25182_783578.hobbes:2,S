Not that easy with just 8 Megs of Fast RAM.  Besides, I couldn't gunzip
the file to look at the image, gzip gives a format error.
Now, I finally got to test it with a very simply self-made initrd.  So
far I only did some read tests in a single thread (dd to /dev/null at
various offsets).  It didn't crash or hang, but I noticed that the
floppy motor is never shut off (I'm not sure about the motor, at least
the floppy LED stays on).  However, that is not a regression, I tested
the mainline code and it shows the same problem.
