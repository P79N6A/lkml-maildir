Subject: [PATCH+comment] fix tmpfs BUG and AOP_WRITEPAGE_ACTIVATE
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

It's possible to provoke unionfs (not yet in mainline, though in mm
and some distros) to hit shmem_writepage's BUG_ON(page_mapped(page)).
I expect it's possible to provoke the 2.6.23 ecryptfs in the same way
(but the 2.6.24 ecryptfs no longer calls lower level's ->writepage).
This came to light with the recent find that AOP_WRITEPAGE_ACTIVATE
could leak from tmpfs via write_cache_pages and unionfs to userspace.
There's already a fix (e423003028183df54f039dfda8b58c49e78c89d7 -
writeback: don't propagate AOP_WRITEPAGE_ACTIVATE) in the tree for
that, and it's okay so far as it goes; but insufficient because it
doesn't address the underlying issue, that shmem_writepage expects
to be called only by vmscan (relying on backing_dev_info capabilities
to prevent the normal writeback path from ever approaching it).
That's an increasingly fragile assumption, and ramdisk_writepage
(the other source of AOP_WRITEPAGE_ACTIVATEs) is already careful
to check wbc->for_reclaim before returning it.  Make the same check
in shmem_writepage, thereby sidestepping the page_mapped BUG also.

Unionfs intends its own, third fix to these issues, checking
backing_dev_info capabilities as the normal writeback path does.
And I intend a fourth fix, getting rid of AOP_WRITEPAGE_ACTIVATE
entirely (mainly to put a stop to everybody asking what it means
and when it happens and how to handle it) - but that's a slightly
bigger patch, needing a little more testing, probably for 2.6.25.
I've CC'ed this to stable as you did for the write_cache_pages
fix: it's probably required for ecryptfs (but unionfs was much
easier to set up and test), and helpful to distros using unionfs
and checking stable for fixes.  Does this make the write_cache_pages
fix redundant?  Probably, but let's have both in for safety.
