Hello
Same problem wit test9-pre kernels (duno when this started, but test8
seems to be fine, and pre9-final is compiling now)
For me it locked up in pine, just after sending an Email, but not always.
(and sure i had to retype my emails serveral times)
And yes my mailfolders are large (may be relevant)
Global configuration:
AMDK6-2/256MB/scsi/ide
Almost anything as module,using raid* on LVM (ide/scsi), 3com 1Gbit
ethernet, netfilter,ipv6,ax.25,ppp, several different
(network) filesystems etc.
Distribution SuSE7.0,  PINE 4.21. and running MTA is qmail 1.03.
