There are two basic problems with the idea:
1) It does nothing to prevent any of the usual abuses of a system - buffer
overflows, shellcode, and the like.  You get fed a bad packet, the signed
Apache binary overflows, and executes the signed /bin/sh that then calls
the signed /bin/echo to append stuff to the appropriate files to create
a back door.....
2) Unless you're working with a kiosk/embedded system where the number of
binaries is quite small, you're looking at a maintenance headache (remember,
if you blindly sign binaries without auditing every single one, you're really not
doing anything useful...)
A *much* better approach would be to do the following:
1) Mount everything either 'read only' or 'noexec', and use something like LSM
to make sure it doesn't get remounted.  So binaries off /home won't run, and
binaries on /usr can't be trojaned (barring OTHER breaches such as remounting,
or scribbling on the raw disk, etc...)
2) Fix the bypasses of noexec (like '/lib/ld-linux.so.2 /your/binary/here').
That's probably a much better way of addressing the "running unauthorized
binaries" threat, without taking a crypto signature hit on every exec().....
