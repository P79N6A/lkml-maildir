 My problem is that I'm too used to the 2.0 setup.  Both aliasing
settings are enabled in 2.2, yet we get the kernel error upon activating
net aliases...

 Well, I have 2 IDE disk drives, 2 IDE cdroms, AND a real SCSI
controller, but enabling scsi emulation for the CD makes the system
lockup on startup...  Worked famously on 2.0.36 tho-  I bring this up
because I've heard several other reports of problems in this area.
