Hi,
I built 2.4.21-pre7 with alsa 0.9.2 at MSI-MS6578 mainboard with AMD-Duron.
After built alsa,and I tried to install snd-via82xx module (for via686a),
I can't install with below messages.
I tried to install oss modules for via686a , this issue is happend , too.
Before 2.4.21-pre6, these issues are *not* happend :-(
Please help....
