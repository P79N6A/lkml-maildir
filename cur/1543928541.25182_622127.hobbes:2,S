That is a very funny way to define a "transparent SCM".  Are you 
complaining about SQL servers being "not transparent"?
By that definition, no SCM, not even CVS, is transparent.  Nothing short 
of unpacked directories of all versions (wasting a lot of disk space) 
would.
IOW the issue you raised is a non-issue.
