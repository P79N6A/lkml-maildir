The code is great, no problem there. But at some places, it needs
a macro that extracts the indices from each node. Callbacks are
likely to be too expensive, and e.g. with VMAs, the indices are
actually calculated, so just passing offsets wouldn't work
either.

Yes, there are some more functions that should be shareable,
i.e. prio_tree_replace, prio_tree_parent, and prio_tree_next.
Also prio_tree_expand might be a candidate.
But this still leaves a few that depend on GET_INDEX.

Yeah, it kind of is, but I'm looking for something more
light-weight, that just gives me an adjacent node. Also, I
want to be able to go back. Here's my prio_tree_prev (minus
the comments). It should look familiar to you :-)
struct prio_tree_node *prio_tree_succ(struct prio_tree_node *node)
{
	if (!prio_tree_right_empty(node)) {
		node = node->right;
		while (!prio_tree_left_empty(node))
			node = node->left;
		return node;
	}
	while (!prio_tree_no_parent(node) && node == node->parent->right)
		node = node->parent;
	return prio_tree_no_parent(node) ? NULL : node->parent;
}
Of course, this kind of iteration only makes sense if your tree
isn't just a bag of random ranges.
