Why is any new macro needed?
struct page
{
#if BITS_PER_LONG == 64 && defined __BIG_ENDIAN
  union {
    unsigned long flags;
    atomic_t count;
  };
#elif BITS_PER_LONG == 64 && defined __LITTLE_ENDIAN
  union {
    unsigned long flags;
    struct {
      int : 32;
      atomic_t count;
    };
  };
#else
  unsigned long flags;
  atomic_t count;
#endif
...
};
should do the job.
