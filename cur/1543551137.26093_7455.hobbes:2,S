Right. 2.0e was supposed to be sent off, but unfortunately, some new error
reports came up which I wanted to address. Then you run out of time because
you have other projects and the thing gets lost.
Actually, 2.0e3 did include one rather important fix which solved the
trouble: Some devices get upset, when the driver tries to negotiate sync 
(or wide) connections, but the device actually does not support it.
So, the driver now waits for the first INQUIRY result and parses the
relevant fields to determine, whether sync should be tried.
As far as I can conclude from the reports I got since the 2.0e3 release (two
weeks ago), it solves the remaining issues.
I'll happily sent a patch against 2.4.0t9 and/or 2.2.18p15 to Linus/Alan to
get an updated version included in the mainstream kernel.
