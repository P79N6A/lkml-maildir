This is by design.  It is possible to close a single direction of data

It may be half there.  It should be in FIN_WAIT1 state.

This is broken application behaviour.  Forgetting about sockets (or any
other resource for that matter) is bad news.

This is the same idea of having a server run that loses a bit of memory
on each bad request.  It would be an application bug, and similarly, the
kernel would have no way to know whether the application was doing
something wrong or not.
If you are _really_ concerned, you'd cap out at NR_OPEN per process
anyway :)
