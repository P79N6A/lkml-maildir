	Weeelll....  This has been an interesting exersize...  Sndconfig
changed three settings on me:
	irq       10 -> 5
	dma        1 -> 0
	mpu_io 0x330 -> 0x300
	So, thinks I, I'll just change them back, one at a time, to see
which one really IS the guilty party...
	I ran "sndconfig --noautoconfig" and change each parameter back
to their original values manually.
	Guess what...
	You guessed it!  Got back to all of the original values and they
all work!  Bizzare...
	One final WAG (Wild Ass Guess).  There was a conflict between the
original settings for the driver and what was written to the card.  Sndconfig
fixed the conflict.  First, it set my parameters to what they SHOULD have
been.  Then they changed the parameters for the module and wrote them out
to the card.  All works...  All is right with the world...
	Please disregard earlier remarks about what worked and what didn't.
It's obviously all MFM ( More F*$#$@ Magic).
	BTW...  For those who are no "into hardware" the MFM comes from
hardware signal encoding.  In particular, floppies have used three different
encoding schemes (amongst others)
	Code	What they say		What they mean
	FM	Frequency Modulation	F*** Magic
	MFM	Modified FM		More F*** Magic
	M2FM	Modified Modified FM	Much More F*** Magic

	Try running sndconfig and see what it does!  It really may make
a difference.  It did for me!  I raised the confusion factor right through
the roof!
