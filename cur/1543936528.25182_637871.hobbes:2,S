A bit more on this issue.  I have received a report that on a X61, it
actually works the opposite from the T61 and you need acpi_osi="!Linux" to
get the "mute" key to work.
Well, I am asking the users to track down exactly *where* the mute key is
comming from in each case (ACPI or keyboard controller).  When I have the
results, I will send an update to this thread.
