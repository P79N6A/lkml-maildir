C is not perfect, it could very well get a bit improved so it helps to make 
the code more readable, etc (and I mean: just improvements, not "lets try to
turn C into a OO language"). That however requires modifying the current
C standards, gcc...
But that doesn't justifies adding C++ support to the kernel.
