Seems to be there on my X60s -- /proc/cpuinfo has:
    model name      : Genuine Intel(R) CPU           L2400  @ 1.66GHz
    flags           : fpu vme de pse tsc msr pae mce cx8 apic sep mtrr pge mca cmov pat clflush dts acpi mmx fxsr sse sse2 ss ht tm pbe nx constant_tsc pni monitor vmx est tm2 xtpr
(I haven't tried it yet but I assume the vmx flag means it's enabled)
