This sounds like your new scheduler intends to increase the coupling 
between scheduling and load balancing.  I think that this would be a 
mistake and lead (down the track) to spiralling complexity as you make 
changes to the code to address the corner conditions that it will create.

You can't really have more than one scheduler operating in the same 
priority range on the same CPU as they will be fighting each other 
trying to achieve their separate and not necessarily compatible (in fact 
highly likely to be incompatible) aims.  Multiple schedulers on the same 
CPU have to have a pecking order just like SCHED_OTHER and real time 
policies.  It wouldn't be hard to prove that SCHED_RR and SCHED_FIFO is 
a problem in waiting if ever someone tried to use them both on a highly 
real time system.

Are your new patches available somewhere for easy download or do I have 
to try to dig them out of the mailing list archive?  Or could you mail 
them to me separately?  I'm keen to see how you new scheduler proposal 
works.
Thanks
