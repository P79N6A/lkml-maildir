And yet you still refuse to offer any real reason for
your subversion of the license.  If the GPL causes you
so many problems, why stick with Linux ? I understand
Schillix is under a license that would probably be more

No-where in the previous mail did I make such a claim.
I stated that trying to educate you was as difficult and pointless
as trying educating pork.  I know metaphors are hard to get your
head around at first, but how old are you? 12 ?
Linux-kernel is not the place for this nonsense. Please take it elsewhere.
