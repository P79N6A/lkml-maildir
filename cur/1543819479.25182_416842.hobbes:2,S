So what happens with a dual amd64 system where each CPU has its "own"
NIC? Something like this:
MEM0 <--> CPU0 <--- HT ---> CPU1 <--> MEM1
           ^                 ^
           |                 |
           HT                HT
           |                 |
           v                 v
      PCI bridge0      PCI1 bridge
           ^                 ^
           |                 |
          PCI               PCI
           |                 |
           v                 v
       GigE NIC0         GigE NIC1
The "best" approach would be to run an Apache on each CPU using local
memory and NIC and having the IRQs handled by the local CPU. Does the
irq balancer allow such a configuraion, or would it be hamperd by the
process scheduler deciding to run both Apaches on a single CPU?
