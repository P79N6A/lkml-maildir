Ok. I suppose open files is the limit, but the problem appears much before that.
Anyway, I tried to change with ulimit -n 2048, but the gThumb still gives up.
(there are only 900 images in the directory, and the program gives up at maybe
600).
The numbers in /proc/sys/fs/file-nr change with a rate of about 3 - 4 each
thumbnail that is opened.
