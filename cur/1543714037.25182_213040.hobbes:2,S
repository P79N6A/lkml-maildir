Somebody who read about potential problems with poll() asked
me to pass this on. They had problems sending mail from yahoo.
It seems that couldn't disable something that gets interpreted
by vger as HTML.

      Subject: Linux version 2.4.24 poll
      Gentlemen:
      In a character device, if I open one with a MINOR number of
      1, variable "minor" in the following driver snippet remains
      0.
      static size_t poll(struct file *fp, struct poll_table_struct
      *wait)
      {
      int minor = MINOR(fp->f_dentry->d_inode->i_rdev);
      If this is a feature, and not a bug, how am I supposed to
      obtain
      the minor number or do I have to use a block device?
      Thanks,
      Gloria
