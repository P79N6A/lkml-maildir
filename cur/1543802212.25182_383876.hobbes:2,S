Yes, I also use the OHCI controller (I guessed that this is
necessary for low speed USB devices...), I commented the calls of
quirk_usb_disable_?hci and renamed the compiled modules so that they
cannot be loaded. Thus, the PS/2 keyboard *does* work with "USB
keyboard support" enabled in the BIOS with kernel 2.6.15. But - of
cource - no USB device does work.
Kind regards, Martin
