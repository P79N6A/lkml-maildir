Subject: ext3 fs boot crash [2.4.18-18]

X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2002/9/8/123

Platform Info:
/dev/sda1  /boot ext3
/dev/sda2  /     ext3 
Kernel version: 2.4.18-17
Problem: 
My system has initrd which contains some modules about
scsi,ext3,etc. During the boot sequence, my system
will crash sometimes(about five times crash once) when
it creates "/boot/kernel.h". Examining fs/namei.c
open_namei(), In failure turn, I found after
path_lookup(), vfs_create() will be called. however,
in vfs_create(), ext2_create() instead of
ext3_create() will be called. While in successful
turn, vfs_create() will not be called. 
At the same time, I printed out inode infomation(boot
inode) after path_lookup.  "after path_lookup().
nd->dentry->d_inode->i_dev:[256],
nd->dentry->d_inode->i_sb->s_dev:[2049]". here, i_dev:
(1,0) /dev/ram0 while s_dev:(8,1) /dev/sda1. why there
is inconsistent info in inode(boot inode) ?
any comments? thanks very much in advance. 
Seaman
