I have an IBM ebony development board which has a PPC 440 
processor. I am trying to build a development system for it. It 
currently loads a cross compiled kernel and kicks out messages via 
the first serial port, no vga. It mounts the root fs via nfs and tries to 
exec /sbin/init. At this point the system appears to hang. 
If I remove /sbin/init from the nfs root the kernel panics as expected, 
so I assume root is mounted ok. I have tried to build a minimum root 
filesystem which contains /dev/console, /dev/ttyS0 and a statically 
linked /sbin/init. The init just does a printf but I do not see this 
message. Does anyone know it this should work ? 
Initially I tried to build a root filesystem from files on a Mac Clone 
running Yellow Dog Linux. I believe this has a PPC 604e processor. 
Should this systems binaries/libraries run on the 440GP ?
Can I expect a statically linked executable, made on the Mac, to run
on the 440GP?
Many Thanks
Simon.
