mm.  For that particular test, you'd get nice speedups from striping
the blockgroups across disks, so each `cat' is probably talking to
a different disk.  I don't think I've seen anything like that proposed
though.
But regardless of the disk topology, the sanest way to get good IO
scheduling is to throw a lot of requests at the block layer.  That's
simple for writes.  But for reads, it's harder.
You could fork one `cat' per file ;)  (Not so silly, really.  But if
you took this approach, you'd need "many" more threads than blockgroups).
Or teach `cat' to perform asynchronous (aio) reads.  You'd need async
opens, too.   But generally we get a good cache hit rate against the
data which is needed to open a small file.
hmm.  What else?  Physical readahead - read metadata into the block
device's pagecache and flip pages from there into directories and
files on-demand.  Fat chance of that happening.
Or change ext2/3 to not place directories in different block groups
at all.  That's super-effective, but does cause somewhat worse long-term
fragmentation.
You can probably lessen the seek-rate by accessing the files in the correct
order.  Read all the files from a directory before descending into any of
its subdirectories.  Can find(1) do that?  You should be able to pretty
much achieve disk bandwidth this way - it depends on how bad the inter-
and intra-file fragmentation has become.
