or perhaps a patch to remove the non-procfs stuff from proc - leaving
just /proc/[0-9]+ and /proc/self...
that way top/ps/ still mostly work without patches and you dont have all
the other stuff that you don't need (perhaps make a separate kernfs?).
i *am* aware of the previous flamewars over this :-) but it does appear
to me a more generally useful compromise in the anti-bloat case.
