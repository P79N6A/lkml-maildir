I don't know this code well, I'm just guessing the rigth way
to make it compile.  I don't know what's the "clean" way
to do #if/#ifdefs either - I could probably do better if I knew.
The problem was that CONFIG_SHARE_RUNQUEUE gets set even with
configs where it doesn't make sense, (i.e. uniprocessor without HT)
so I guessed it was some sort of misunderstanding about
how #ifdef works.  I hope whoever wrote that code will
take a look and either say "yes - that's what I meant"
or fix it in a better way.
