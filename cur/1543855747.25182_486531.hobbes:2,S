  Well, applications do not need to do any polling on the queue anymore.
io_getevents() needs to be called only once when the signal has been received,
either from a signal handler or from a thread blocking on the signal.

  Right, but only once.

  Yes, no more polling loop and I think this makes a big difference.

  Uh! what do you mean here?
