Subject: 2.6.25-rc2 regression: kobject handling in cpufreq doesn't allow the system to power off

Hi,
I'm using the latest Linus' git tree, and the bug with cpufreq not allowing
the system to power off is still there.
With the patch sent some days ago (
http://lkml.org/lkml/2008/2/8/346
), it
works fine. There is also a bugzilla entry for this bug here:
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=9960
Any ideas of when will this patch be going to mainline?
Cheers,
Carlos
