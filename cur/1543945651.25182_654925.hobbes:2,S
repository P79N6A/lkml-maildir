Hugh,
Check out my latest set of patches (which correspond to release 2.2.4 of
Unionfs).  Thanks to your info and the patch, I was able to trigger several
races more frequently, and fix them.  I've tested my code with make -j N
(for N=4 and N=20), on a 4 cpu machine a well as a 2 cpu machine (w/
different amounts of memory and CPU speeds, also 32-bit vs 64-bit); I ran a
kernel compile for ~10-12 hours.  With the patches I just posted, I wasn't
able to trigger any of the WARN_ON's in unionfs_copy_attr_times.  I also
tried it while flushing caches via /proc, and/or performing branch-mgmt
commands in unionfs.
Give it a good shake and let me know what you find.
Thanks,
Erez.
