Then I hope you don't mind me asking, why is there (L)indent? Everyone 
can make a mistake and if your editor does not auto-format then there 
may be a whitespace straying.
I also guess you saw that the script is _not_ for cleaning up 
source-files (can be intrusive and is better to be fixed when fixing 
something else), but patches. So if a maintainer does not have anything 
to easily fix those, they might want a simple script to do the work 
(otherwise I believe they just deleted my mail ;) ).
As I said in the posting, it is just if someone is interested in it, 
otherwise you have a Del-button.
