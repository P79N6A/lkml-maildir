But I understood hpa's suggestion to mean that there would be a standard
PCI interface for a hardware RNG, and a single linux driver for that
device, which all hypervisors would be expected to implement.  But
that's only reasonable if the virtualization environment has some notion
of PCI to expose to the Linux guest.
