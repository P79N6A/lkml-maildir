For me Bill's patch (with the recursive thingie) is very cryptic. Its
just doing log2(n), it took me an hour to figure it out with his help.

Oops, right. wli's patch is borked for NUMA. Clamping it at 64 should do fine.

Whats the L1 cache size of Itanium2? Each page is huge compared to the pagevec
structure (you need a 64 item pagevec array on 64-bits to occupy the space of 
one 4KB page). So I think you wont blow up the cache even with a really big 
pagevec.

Not very noticeable on reaim. I want to do more tests (different workloads, nr CPUs, etc).
