Subject: /dev/random entropy calcs - patch [not related to net devices]
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

1. Anyone have a problem with using xtime rather
   than jiffies on architectures which don't support cycle
   counters? (completely untested patch attached to illustrate)
2. Anyone have any problem changing fs/proc/proc_misc.c to
   register /proc/interrupts to be 0600 instead of 0644 to help
   prevent entropy attacks that way?
