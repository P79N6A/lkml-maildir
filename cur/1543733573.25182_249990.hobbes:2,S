IIUC, this isn't safe (you might tie your filesystem into a knot this way,
as LWN puts it). Sure, you can do it right now (just as I was able to
create hard links to directories in some propietary Unix way back;
untangling the resulting mess, complete with segfaulting fsck, was a whole
world of fun... it just happened rarely enough that it did not matter very
much); production versions will have to forbid it (or incurr in _huge_
overheads locking everything in sight, or detecting loops).
