From the linux kernel HOWTO:
...
                cd /usr/src
                gzip -cd patchXX.gz | patch -p0
   (repeat xx for all versions bigger than the version of your current
   source tree, _in_order_) and you should be ok.  You may want to remove
   the backup files (xxx~ or xxx.orig), and make sure that there are no
   failed patches (xxx# or xxx.rej). If there are, either you or me has
   made a mistake.
