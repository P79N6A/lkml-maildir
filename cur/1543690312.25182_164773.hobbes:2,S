Its a _lot_ more than that in the normal case. Upwards of 60 clocks on 
a PIV. You then need to reload cr3 if you touched permissions which
means every cached TLB in the system is lost, and you may need to do
a cross CPU IPI on SMP (which takes a long time)

Think of a threaded app passing a message to another app. You have to do
the cross CPU flush in order to prevent races where another thread can
scribble on data it doesnt own. Assuming a reasonable TLB reuse rate
thats 120 plus TLB reloads. The newer CPU's cache TLB's in L1/L2 so
thats not too bad but it all adds up. On SMP its a real pain

You don't need a global lock to copy memory. 
One thing I do agree with you on is the API aspect - and that is
problematic. The current API leaves data also owned by the source.
If I write "fred" down a pipe I still own the "fred" bits. The 
method you propose was added long ago go to Solaris (see "doors") and
its not exactly the most used interface even there.
