Right.

Part of the design tradeoffs.

On-disk filesystems (and block device handling) are designed around that
fact.

But the current on.disk filesystems use caching of data in RAM extensively,
/without/ having to keep the whole file in memory, just the pieces
currently in active use. Your proposal negates the RAM for caches, so it
would be much /slower/ than the current on-disk filesystems.
BTW, many of the live-CD distributions do exactly this (RAM overlay over a
CD-based filesystem).
