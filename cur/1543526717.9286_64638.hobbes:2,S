Because the idea of capabilities is to restrict special powers to
individual processes (programs) on a need to use basis. Note that this is
_very_ different from the traditional Unix model, where UID 0 is
all-powerful, always. It means that the special powers are handled as a
set, and creating special users for each combination of capabilities is
unworkable (there are currently 28 capabilities defined in the kernel).

And said user can then create all-powerful processes at will, and we are
back to the superuser. No dice.

Which means that if root runs a random program (possibly written by the
3v17 h@x0r; or perhaps a stock program with an exploitable bug), it can
take over the whole system. Exactly what capabilities were designed to
prevent.
And sorry, there seems to be no easy path from here to there.  No
reasonable way to "switch back for a while" in sight either.
