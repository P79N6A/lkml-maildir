Nope. We limit only unreclaimable mappings. Allowing user
to break limits breaks the sense of limit.
Or you do not agree that allowing unlimited unreclaimable
mappings doesn't alow you the way to cut groups gracefully?

Could you send me an URL where to get the patch from, please.
Or the patch itself directly to me. Thank you.

Paul Menage won't agree. He believes that interface must come first.
I also remind you that the latest beancounter patch provides all the
stuff we're discussing. It may move tasks, limit all three resources
discussed, reclaim memory and so on. And configfs interface could be
attached easily.

I'll review Rohit's patches and comment.
