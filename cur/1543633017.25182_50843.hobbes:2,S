drivers/base is always compiled in. So SET_MODULE_OWNER will set the owner 
to NULL.

So the __MOD_{INC,DEC}_USE_COUNT() should oops right here.
If you tested it and it doesn't oops, I don't understand why.
So, for one, if you want to go that road, you should use fops_get()/put()
(you can use just these, or rename them appropriately), they'll do the
right thing if a thing is modular as opposed to built-in (owner == NULL).
And, you need to set the owner from the module which you want to protect.
So in the your driver:
struct pci_driver my_drv {
	probe: ...
	driver : {
		owner: THIS_MODULE,
	}
}
which certainly is ugly since owner is in a sub-struct. But it's not
really a possibility anyway, since in this case pci_register_driver will 
do a MOD_INC_USE_COUNT and you never have a chance to call 
pci_unregister_driver() to decrement it again, since you need to have it
decremented before you can call pci_unregister_driver() (because
that's called from your module_exit() function).
