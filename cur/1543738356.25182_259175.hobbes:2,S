Oh, I was not going to post a patch, I don't know the code nearly well
enough at this point :-).  But it looks pretty straightforward.
This also addresses what I think was Linus' main objection to PREEMPT,
which IIRC was (paraphrasing) that maybe if the scheduler had been
smarter we would not be having to preempt all the time.  This argument
is perfectly valid except for a SCHED_FIFO task which by definition will
always know better than the scheduler does when it needs to run.
