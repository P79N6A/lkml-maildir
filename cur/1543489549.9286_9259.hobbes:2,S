Hello everyone,
I tried to install 2.2.3 with a patch but failed to compile in my home
computer as well as in office computer. I don't know what is happening. The
following is what I've received:
/usr/src/linux/include/net/sock.h: 796: deferencing pointer incomplete type
/usr/src/linux/include/net/sock.h: 796: deferencing pointer incomplete type
/usr/src/linux/include/net/sock.h: 796: warning: passing arg1 of
'sk_run_filter'
from incompatible pointer type
And the same message for sock.h:807, sock.h:811, sock.h:817
. . .
make[2] ***[slhc.o] Error 1
make[2] Leaving directory '/usr/src/linux/drivers/net'
make[1] ***[_modsubdir_net] Error 2
make[1] Leaving directory '/usr/src/linux/drivers'
make ***[med_drivers] Error 2
. . . etc, etc
and
Installing modules under /lib/modules/2.2.2/block
Installing modules under /lib/modules/2.2.2/misc
. . . and stops. The patch as I mentioned is applied. I never had a problem
compiling kernel with Alan Cox's patch and this is the first time its
happening. Any feedback will be greatly appreciated.  Thanks to all. Alex
