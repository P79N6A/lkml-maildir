Perhaps, but
     1. Existing kernel style uses braces with single-statement
        do-while.
     2. Linus prefers (or at least preferred in October of 2006) braces
        with single-statement do-while.

Good point; Sparse shouldn't warn about this by default.  I've turned
that off in latest Sparse from Git, so you need to give -Wdo-while or
-Wall to get warnings about that.  However, the kernel gives -Wall, so
you'll still see the warnings there.
