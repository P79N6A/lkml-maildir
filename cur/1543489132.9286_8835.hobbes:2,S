FWIW:
As a further data point - I get these whenever I forget that my X is
running and also when I use nohup on an NFS mount as the nohup.out file is
held open. Seems harmless - eventually the RPC times out and life
continues on. But I can still see the NFS session being held open on the
server (Netware NFS) for another few minutes until the server decides I
really am gone.
