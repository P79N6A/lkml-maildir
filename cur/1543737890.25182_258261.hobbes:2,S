For the time being I wrote (in select.2)
BUGS
       It has been reported (Linux 2.6) that select may report  a
       socket  file descriptor as "ready for reading", while nev-
       ertheless a subsequent read  blocks.  This  could  perhaps
       happen  when  data  has  arrived  but upon examination has
       wrong checksum and is discarded. Thus it may be  safer  to
       use non-blocking I/O.
(I have not yet investigated, just read the lk posts. Does this
really happen? All kernel versions? Is this the explanation for
the reported behaviour?)

Returning 0 for a read signifies end-of-file. Not what you want.
