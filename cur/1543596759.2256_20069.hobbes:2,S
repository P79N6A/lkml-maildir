Absolutely. But that, in turn, should cause just others getting stuck, not
running, no?
Anyway, having looked at the buffer case, I htink I found a potentially
nasty bug: "unlock_buffer()" with a buffer cout of zero.
Why is this nasty? unlock_buffer() does:
	extern inline void unlock_buffer(struct buffer_head *bh)
	{
	        clear_bit(BH_Lock, &bh->b_state);
	        smp_mb__after_clear_bit();
	        if (waitqueue_active(&bh->b_wait))
	                wake_up(&bh->b_wait);
	}
but by doing the "clear_bit()", it also potentially free's the buffer, so
an interrupt coming in (or another CPU) can end up doing a kfree() on the
bh.
At which point the "waitqueue_active()" and the wakeup call are operating
on random memory.
This does not explain __wait_on_buffer(), but it's a bug none-the-less.
Anybody can find anything else fishy with buffer handling?
