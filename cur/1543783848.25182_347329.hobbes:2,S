Huh? For most people dynamic-tick is much more descriptive name than
NO_IDLE_HZ or VST!
If you wanted, you could reprogram the next timer to happen from
{add,mod,del}_timer() just by calling the timer_dyn_reprogram() there.
And you would want to do that if you wanted sub-jiffie timer interrupts.
So I'd rather not limit the name to the currently implemented functionality
only :)
