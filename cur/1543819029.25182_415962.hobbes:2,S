Hi,
I am running Linux 2.6.12.2 on a dual P4 1 GB machine with hyperthreading enabled, and I my kernel
has oopsed when disconnecting my USB DVB adapter. The adapter was not in use at the time. I wasn't
able to capture much of the oops, but it looks like the remote-control thread still had a
work-item oustanding after the device was disconnected:
dvb_use_read_remote_control+0x1d/0xba [dvb_usb]
worker_thread
run_work_queue
dvb_usb_read_remote_control+0x0/0xba [dvb_usb]
worker_thread
worker_thread
default_wake_function
kthread
kthread
kernel_thread_helper
Cheers,
Chris
