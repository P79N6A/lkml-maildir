Excellent ! Some things that should probably be added:
 - 8.4 "GNU Extensions": Labeled Elements (very useful for some of our
   fairly monstrous struct foo_ops)
 - 5.2: you may want to discuss disable_irq, disable_irq_nosync, and
   enable_irq. On most (all?) architectures, they are reasonably
   inexpensive ways to block specific interrupts. (BTW, why don't we
   actually have some kind of interrupt blocking that doesn't go down
   to the interrupt controller hardware ? Is the PIC part considered
   to be cheap enough in all possible cases ?)
 - maybe 2.1: synchronize_irq and synchronize_bh to wait that whatever
   change that made some interrupts or bhs go away has actually taken
   place.

I could see some market potential nevertheless ;-)
