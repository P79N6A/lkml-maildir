The situation is not as bad as you think, Rik.  I grepped; the Documentation
subtree only has 17 instances of KB, of which about 6 clearly don't need
correcting as they really are referring to disk capacities.  The patch to
fix these references would not be large.

...Virtually never are murderers the ordinary, law-abiding people
against whom gun bans are aimed.  Almost without exception, murderers
are extreme aberrants with lifelong histories of crime, substance
abuse, psychopathology, mental retardation and/or irrational violence
against those around them, as well as other hazardous behavior, e.g.,
automobile and gun accidents."
