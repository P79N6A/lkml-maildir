 Applications should be using whatever the libraries available to them
provide.  This does *not* belong in the kernel.

 Diversity is good.  Competition between projects often benefits the end
users.  If you want to write a better XML parsing library, or to assist
one of the existing projects, please do so (after you have identified
whatever shortcomings you see in the existing choices) - but in
userspace.  And in userspace you will find that many potential users of
an xml parser are kernel-agnostic - they run on linux 2.2 or 2.4 (which
are in maintenance mode), BSDs, and others.
