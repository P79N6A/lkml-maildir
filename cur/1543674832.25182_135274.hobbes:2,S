We'll see... I would really like to ignore MDMA.  For the reasons just 
outlined in replies to Linus, PATA support is quite useful in limited 
situations, but is not at all the focus of the driver.  When situations 
arise where special support for some PATA situation is needed, I will 
most likely just say "use drivers/ide"...
