The problem is that the straightforward way to implement this helper
modifies three of its parameters (the current buffer location, the
amount of space left, and the current index).  It seemed ugly to force
these three parameters to be passed by address.
I could easily rework this to do as you suggest though.  Greg, what's
your opinion?
Thanks,
  Roland
