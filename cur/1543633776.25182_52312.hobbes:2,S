We're all about jamming system specific information into the checking
extensions.  It's usually just a few if statements.  So to be clear: we
can simply assume that the loop 
   link_path_walk
	->do_follow_link
		->foofs_follow_link
			->vfs_follow_link
				->link_path_walk
can happen exactly 5 times?
In general such restrictions are interesting, since they concretely
show how having a way to include system-specific knowlege into checking
is useful.  Are there any other such relationships?  The other example
I know of is the do_page_fault (sp?) routine that can potentially be
invoked at very copy_*_user site that page faults.  You need to know
this to detect certain classes of deadlock, but there's no way to
discern this path from the code without a priori knowlege.
