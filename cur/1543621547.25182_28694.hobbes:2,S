Eric, why don't you try to make a system that is not openly disgusting
and revolting?  The kernel affects everyone.  Bribing congress is a
tactic worthy of Microsoft, not of you.  Please concentrate on making
good software and not on fast talking to Jeff until he takes a
sabbatical to get some rest at all.
The more of your mails about CML I see, the more I am disgusted with it.
