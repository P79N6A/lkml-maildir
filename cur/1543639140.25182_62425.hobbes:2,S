Nick, I think that's a matter of taste. I am perfectly happy to default to
using the ideN based on the io address, or any other determanent method,
as long as it's reasonable to have the user specify the order if s/he has
a reason to do so. Of course some BIOS will mess up io addresses at some
time, crappy {hard,firm}ware is a problem in any case.
I would just as soon use a boot option as to try and make it a compile
option, and I think that many people just use a compiled kernel and never
change, which argues for a reasonable default (most pdc20265) ARE
currently offboard, and an easy way to change it.
