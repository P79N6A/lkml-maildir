I _think_ i've run two X displays (two complete X servers, even. Two
different users) under matroxfb once. I'm not entirely sure, i've only used
the fb for a while, but i frequently use two or three X servers under
just as many usernames, to make snapshots of homepages, using netscape,
xwpick and a simple shell script.

Ah, yes, but this the X server can help. Never ignore the TERM signal, and
always instantly switch back to text mode _before_ starting the shutdown of
the window manager and applications. Even if this keeps lockfiles on disk
because of the SIGKILL, it's better than having no display in single user
mode AND having stale lockfiles :-)
I assume, of course, that the specific X server can choose to switch to a
text console, but i seem to recall a small userspace utility that did just
that -- so the X server should be able to.

If not killing the X server will leave your console unusable, sending it
SIGKILL will hardly help. It would be a lot more helpful if it'd save the
videocards' state and restore it in such a case. I understand it's not
possible with all video cards though. Shame :P
