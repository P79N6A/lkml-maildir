    I have two hard drives, side-by-side, and sometimes they overheat and

OK then... if it weren't for the fact other people have reported
similar problems I would say all bets are off. mbox files get
corrupted when machines crash because of their (mis)design; might
this be the case for you here? Or do you see corruption without hard
drive crashes and OS crashes?
It's pretty much impossible to debug and test software when the
hardware if unreliable or unpredictable.
