Subject: [CFT] updated gcc-3.4.0 fixes patch for 2.4.27-pre1

There is now an updated patch for compiling 2.4.27-pre1
with gcc-3.4.0. It's 50KB+ so I'm not inlining it in
this message; instead get it from:
http://www.csd.uu.se/~mikpe/linux/patches/2.4/patch-gcc340-fixes-v2-2.4.27-pre1
The changes since the first version are:
- updates for the x86_64 and ppc kernels
- more drivers corrected (parport_pc, fbcon, hid-core, ...)
- corrected evaluation order in UP version of __IRQ_STAT
Tested with gcc-3.4.0 on i386 UP and SMP, x86_64 UP and SMP,
and ppc UP. Regression tested with gcc-2.95.3 on i386 SMP.
Please test if you have any interest in being able to
use gcc-3.4.0 with 2.4 kernels.
There was a question about why I disabled -funit-at-a-time.
This is taken from the 2.6.6-rc3 kernel. It's not only a
workaround for gcc rewriting sprintf "%s" to strcpy() while
also failing to inline strcpy(). 2.6.6-rc3 claims that it
substantially increases stack usage, which is unacceptable
in the kernel.
