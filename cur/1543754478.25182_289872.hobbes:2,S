Well, according to the mailing-list archives, which have a better memory
than I do, I skipped at least one:
http://archives.andrew.net.au/lm-sensors/msg18655.html
So I suspect that this update at least was never reviewed by anyone (on
the sensors list at least).
And while we are at it, this post by Andrew is certainly of interest
too:

Sure, sio would be better, or even superio in whole. Anything that
reminds "Super-I/O" is fine with me. sc doesn't.

The PC87366 has integrated sensors, some of which have to be connected
whatever your configuration: voltage inputs 7 to 10 and third
temperature channel. We have a driver for it in the kernel:
drivers/i2c/chips/pc87360. So if you have such a chip, this is actually
someone you can use as a test for your superio subsystem.
If you can provide a patch which adds your superio core driver and one
which modifies the pc87360 driver to take make use of it, and only that,
this would certainly be easier for everyone (and especially me) to
review your superio code. Once this is in, incremental patches for the
additional features should be easier for you to generate and for the
rest of us to review.
Thanks,
