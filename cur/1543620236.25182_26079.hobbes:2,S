The hierarchy seems to be two levels deep now.  Linus doesn't accept patches 
from all 300 maintainers anyway, he has a group of a dozen or so lieutenants. 
 (Andre Hedrick has to send code to Jens Axboe, for example, before Linus 
will take it.)
Being a lieutenant would have to require bitkeeper before simply being a 
maintainer would.  I doubt it would ever work its way to simple developers 
submitting to maintainers.
(This is, of course, just my take on things...)
