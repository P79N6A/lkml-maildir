No argument here.  Why do you think I have been using the term "legacy
system"? (:

I realize, but it's a relatively painless solution compared to either
(a) calculating DST in the kernel or (b) adding fields to the stat
structure for userspace to play with or (c) hacking userspace to look
at mount points and know about non-timezoned filesystems.  Oh yeah, how
about (d) hack your legacy system, somehow, to store dates as UTC.
Actually there's also (e) use only mtools and skip the kernel FAT
(mtools gets all this right already).

So where does the kernel FAT code get its timezone from?  hwclock?

This is true.  Which of the five alternate solutions I listed above
appeals to you the most?  I don't like any of them except (e).  Or do
you have a sixth?
