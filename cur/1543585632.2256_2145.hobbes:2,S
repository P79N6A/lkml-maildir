Thanks, but I expected it a little bit. All around Linux is centered
around getting the highest performance out of it and very low (to low
IMHO) is done to have a save system. The attitude "It doesn't matter
making mistakes, they get fix anyhow" annoys me most, especially if it
were easy to prevent them.

Not with a AT power supply but certainly nice to have. See that it gets
included into the kernel. I didn't lost anything important since it was
just a testing machine. I was just shocked what fsck complained on a
machine which hadn't done almost anything at all. If I'd run into this
on a productive system I'd get immediately a serial keyboard or have at
least a usable network connection. Besides USB-only is not ready yet.

Is there a similar expression which could be hammered into any
developers mind, i.e. "Don't make errors, others already do them for you".
