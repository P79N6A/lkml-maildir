Amusing question, isn't it you who dropped the patch (= quit
cooperation) without looking at it?

So Debian didn't delete your bugs? Hm... and tomorrow you'll tell us you
never insinuated Debian deleted bugs.
Quote "This seems to be a general problem with QSI-drives, see e.g.
http://lists.debian.org/debian-user-german/2004/debian-user-german-200402/msg05143.html
which shows testimonials about failed blanking of cd-rws for QSI
CD-RW/DVD-ROM SBW-241, cdrdao succeeds."
"If you are unwilling to remove a non cdrecord related bug from the list
or if you unable to understand the background, you should ask for help
or leave the cdrecord project."
