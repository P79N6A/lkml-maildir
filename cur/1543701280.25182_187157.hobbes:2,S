Hi,
Just FYI.
This is my patch.
http://pkgcvs.turbolinux.co.jp/~go/patch-2.6/dpt_i2o.patch
Worked fine for me on quad xeon with 4G mem and 64bit PCI.
It include.
- Support 2.6 kernel and DMA-mapping
- ioctl fix for raid tools
- use schedule_timeout in long long loop
- not support 64bit CPU yet.
However, It may differ from the Adaptec policy (linux-scsi ML).
