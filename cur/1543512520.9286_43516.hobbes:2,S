ra.nframes would be between 1 and 8 frames before anyway. The
8 is wrong though, since the app might just be asking for
1 block. I have changed that when merging.

It isn't in the middle, read the C standard.

We're still doing between 1 and 8 frames in each pass, but
the app might have asked for 300 in total.

How would that be possible? We setup the cgc command block
every time, there's no hidden state information.
