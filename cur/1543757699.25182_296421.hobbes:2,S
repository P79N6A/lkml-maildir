Okay. Where will they go? include/video ?

Ha Ha. I didn't know the history.

I can live with this issue as long it would not increase the complexity of 
framebuffer only devices. Simple api is very important to me. The current
fbdev api is designed to be very simple for the most common cases. It can 
get complex tho with exotic hardware.

Is this because you want to be OS portable? This makes things very very 
hard to merge. Fbdev attempts to take advantage the most powerful linux
kernel features.

If it is GPL in the kernel then that is fine. We can work with that. I 
don't care about userland code.

That will be a huge amount of work! BTW what does CP stand for?

As for the VGA class driver. We already have something like that for the 
fbdev layer. Take a look at vgastate.c. It was written originally so you 
could go from vgacon to fbdev without fbcon and back to vgacon state 
again. It also has common functions for all the drivers to work with. I 
already asked Jon to merge his work with that code. That code could also 
be very useful for vgacon in the future. We need vga core management in 
the kernel.
