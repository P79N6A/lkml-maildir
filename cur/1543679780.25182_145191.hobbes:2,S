I may have this problem on my dual celeron.  I noticed X got sluggish
while generating a key for mozilla - very strange on a dual
but I put it down to the scheduler changes.
Looking at dmesg I see that both is detected, and it claims
both are "activated", but I get this a little later:
Starting migration thread for cpu 0
Bringing up 1
CPU 1 IS NOW UP!
Starting migration thread for cpu 1
CPUS done 2
mtrr: v2.0 (20020519)
I never get a CPU 2 IS NOW UP (or CPU 0)
