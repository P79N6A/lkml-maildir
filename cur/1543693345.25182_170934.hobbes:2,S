I'd like my kernel to have as small a footprint as possible. Allocated
memory that is almost never used is waste. It may not be much, but 
"add little to little and you will have a big pile". Whatever, we're
not the big pile yet and I'm not concerned enough to cook up patches.

I guess by then we'll have an excellent udev version with no known
bugs. ;) However, requiring more and more packages to be installed just
to boot a system is also not something I like much.
