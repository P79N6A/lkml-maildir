Going off at a tangent (or tangle, rather), why do we need DECLARE_FOO()
macros at all? They
 - do not look like C variable declarations, hide variable type, and
 hence are confusing,
 - contrary to their naming actually _define_ rather than _declare_ an
 object.
In most cases 
        type var = INIT_FOO;
is much better (more readable and easier to understand) than
        DECLARE_FOO(var); /* what is the type of var? */
In the cases where initializer needs an address of object being
initialized
        type var = INIT_FOO(var);
can be used.
Nikita.
