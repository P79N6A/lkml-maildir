Thanks Rik.
This is not my area, but based on the earlier discussions, and on RH's
intent to distribute and support the code and on its overall footprint and
upon Stephen's words I shall proceed with this.
This patch gets non-trivial rejects against x86_64-update.patch, mainly in
thread_info.h.  Also note that arch/x86_64/ia32/ia32entry.S has gained
another usage of TIF_SYSCALL_TRACE.  Could you please rework and retest it
on top of
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.4/2.6.4-mm1/broken-out/x86_64-update.patch
Or you can wait a day or so - we should merge the x86_64 patch into Linus's
tree later this week.
