Subject: [PATCH] Linux 2.4.x MTD CFI P30/P33 support
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hello Willy,
The following patch adds support of P30 and P33 NOR FLASH support in
Linux 2.4
This flash is substitution of J3 flash which is widely used it on Linux
2.4 kernels. Currently many customers wishing to substitute J3 for P3x
face issues on Linux 2.4. This patch resolves issues with P3x on all
generic Linux kernels versions since 2.4.21.
The patch just allows using minor version "4" in CFI driver. Since
differences between CFI minor version "3" and minor version "4" are
small the CFI driver is not affected by this. Patch has been verified on
Mainstone (PXA27x based) platform.
