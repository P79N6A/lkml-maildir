  The bullet is going to have to be bitten, preferably sooner rather
than later.  The distribution argument is a red herring, if you
rely on the distribution supplied binaries only then they will
update the distribution.  If however you roll your own kernels
then changing a couple of scripts isn't really a problem.  The
people running raid atm are the people who need reliable kernels
which means they need to track the stable kernels and need the
raid support up to date.
  Speaking from experience it is hard justifying linux solutions
when you have to run older kernels with known showstopper bugs which
keep biting you just because the raid patch isn't tracking kernel
releases.
