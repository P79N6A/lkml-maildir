I think the problem is a bit bigger than this.  This problem in a nut
shell is that cc compiles the inline code when it sees it, not when it
is referenced.  This means inline functions should _NOT_ be in header
files _PERIOD_.  Of the two possible fixes, I vote for fixing cc, but I
am not holding my breath.
I suppose that this could also be fixed by cleaning up the header files
to remove the circular includes, but again, I am not holding my breath.
I am not trying to write inline code, just trying to modify the spinlock
macros to reference the tast_struct, ooh bad me.
