sigsetjmp saves the signal mask in addition to what setjmp does, that's
all.  So it can be written in terms of setjmp and sig* if necessary.  In
some cases, it's not even necessary to do this so plain setjmp will do.
The Linux man page indicates sigsetjmp is a POSIX thing.

You seem to be suggesting that this stuff live in kernel space, which
isn't strictly necessary.  Alternatively that it go in a library, in
which case, the kernel mechanisms are adequate already :-)
Not that I think select+signals is all that wonderful either.
