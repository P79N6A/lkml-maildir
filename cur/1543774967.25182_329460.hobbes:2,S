I agree that it is quite high rate. However, as you pointed out,
shell scripts may fork processes in very high rate.
Another reason I don't like this default values is that
forkrate_interval is too long.
Please imagine if forkrate limite is reached in the first 30 minutes,
we cannot fork any process for another 30 minutes. It is not what
I expected.
Thanks,
