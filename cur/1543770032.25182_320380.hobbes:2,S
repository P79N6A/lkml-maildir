Note: I didn't say we should remove proc_check_root().  I said _if_
you remove it, _then_ mounting on foreign namespace will work, which
has actually been confirmed experimentally.
So your follow_link argument doesn't hold.  The proc code does the
follow_link in some clever way, that the looked up object will end up
with the same vfsmount/dentry pair as the file.

OK.  Let's keep the kernel policy simple: just allow a process to
access it's _own_ file descriptors in proc.  I.e. allow access to
/proc/self/fd/* even if it comes from a foreign namespace.
Then the policy (who passes whom the file descriptors) is entirely up
to userspace (just as with your scheme).
/proc/self/fd/FD doesn't give any extra rights to the process, it just
makes mounting from/to detached mounts, and foreign namespaces
possible without new interfaces.

Did you measure the effect on performace?  Maybe it isn't so bad.
