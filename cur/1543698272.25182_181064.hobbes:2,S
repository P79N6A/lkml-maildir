My ICH5 was happily using my brand new 200GB SATA maxtor drive, at least up
until last Friday when it crashed. Grumble, a brand new drive.
I guess what I'm looking for is the "FAQ" or "README" file that most projects
have. What are the advantages of using the libata patch vs the stock drivers
and vice versa? What are the differences between the two?
