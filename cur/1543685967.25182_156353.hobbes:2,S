Yep, I did see the multiple j10s ;)
I wasn't aware that there was longer term starvation of gccs by X. I
thought the scheduler had always been quite good at evening up the
total CPU time used and a change you made had recently introduced a
latency or interactiveness problem.
But Martin didn't give a very detailed description of the problem,
and no I definitely don't think you should be aiming at fixing
his problem if it causes starvation or harms more common loads.
