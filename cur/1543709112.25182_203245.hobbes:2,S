This is the latest release of the -tiny kernel tree. The aim of this
tree is to collect patches that reduce kernel disk and memory
footprint as well as tools for working on small systems. Target users
are things like embedded systems, small or legacy desktop folks, and
handhelds.
Latest release includes:
 - update to 2.6.3
 - add latest netdev patchkit (Jeff Garzik)
 - optional minimal VT support
 - optional sysfs backing store support (Maneesh Soni)
 - optional legacy pty support (H Peter Anvin)
 - optional support for ELF with a.out libs (Peter Mazinger)
 - optional configurable alignment flags (Denis Vlasenko)
 - various other minor cleanups
The big new feature is a stripped down version of the virtual terminal
subsystem, especially useful for systems that run GUIs. This feature
is still a work in progress.
