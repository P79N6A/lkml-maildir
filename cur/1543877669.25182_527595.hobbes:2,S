Hi Andi,
Here's a couple of patches to fix up COMPAT_VDSO:
The first is a straightforward implementation of Jan's original idea
of relocating the VDSO to match its mapped location.  Unlike Jan and
Zach's version, I changed it to relocate based on the phdrs rather than
the sections; the result is pleasantly compact.
The second patch takes advantage of the fact that all the COMPAT_VDSO work
happens at runtime now, and allows compat mode to be enabled dynamically.
If you specify vdso=2 on the kernel command line, it comes up in compat
mode; vdso=1 is normal vdso mode, and vdso=0 disables vdso altogether.
You can also switch modes with sysctl.
Thanks,
	J
