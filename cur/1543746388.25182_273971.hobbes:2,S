Actually I can reproduce it reliably by running nfs_fsstress.sh for a
looong time.  The problem is that in the current XFS code the inode
generation counter starts at 0, but higher level code uses that as
a wildcard for any possible generation, so you may get a newly created
file for a stale nfs file handler of an deleted file with the same inode
number.
The patch below fixes it for me:
