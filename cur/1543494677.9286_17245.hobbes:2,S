This oops does not cause a memory corruption, it is often caused by a
previous
memory corruption...
I don't agree because:
a) spinlocks & semaphores are still a big problem. This problem gets
bigger
as we further deserialize the kernel.
b) if you test drivers, it would be possible to use the old behaviour:
the problem is that if you have a oops on a production machine, then
you don't know what happened, i.e. internal ext2 structures could be
corrupted, and if you don't restart immediately, then you risk that
the harddisk gets corrupted further, or wrong data could be sent over
the network. Look at a journaling filesystem: it can recover quickly,
because it knows that all incomplete writes are described in the log:
if one sector write is lost, and the computer crashes 60 seconds later,
then the fsck will not be able to detect the error by examining the log.
