Since I'm still CC'ed, I thought I could add in my 2 cents, too ;)
I agree with Rusty, his ordered initcalls are really needed most at early 
points during the system initialization, way before device discovery and 
initialization. They allow for a lot of cleanup and clarification in that 
area, so I definitely think they should go in.
Those initcalls that only do pci_register_driver() and the like are
typically the module_init() functions and are taken care of by Roman's
patch. Also, inserting devices into the device tree and handling them can
only happen after the kernel knows about the drivers, which it only does
after the corresponding initcall has run. The place where to insert them
is however an entirely different story, and that's handled by the device
tree just fine.
