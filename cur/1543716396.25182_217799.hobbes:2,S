The HSF modules give back what they can right now, which is all 
operating system source, in an attempt to strike a reasonable 
compromise.

Understood. So perhaps we should call it "open" and "proprietary" which

Yes, I see what you are saying and agree that the user should be told 
*once* about the proprietary module, but I don't know how you will 
manage to make it look like blinking neon from within the kernel ;-)
