ARP means address resolution protocol. That's how one machine
learns about the MAC (Hardware) address of another so it can
communicate with it. Without ARP, you need to send / receive
broadcast packets (Like M$ Netboius). This means that everything
is received by everyone on the LAN and needs to be dumped on
the floor by everybody except the intended target.
