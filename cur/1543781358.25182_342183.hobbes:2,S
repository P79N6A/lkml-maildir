They don't exist in 2.4 mainline.  The ia64 patch and then many
distributions introduced it because the EFI partitions spec contains
some braindamage that requries accessing the last sector.  In 2.6 the
block device nodes can do that, so the ioctls aren't needed either.
In short this patch should not go into mainline 2.4, it doesn't support
ia64 anyway and if it did it wouldn't compile because the ioctls aren't
defined.
