right.  which is why i optimized the HE_SPIN_LOCK away on
!CONFIG_SMP.  actually, its probably not a problem on certain
smp machines either.  i dont believe the i386 will reorder
read/writes from multiple cpus so in theory it would be safe to
do away with this lock on smp i386's.  the only arch that 
can reorder (and actually has posted read/writes) is the ia64/sn2.

well it wasnt much cost but i essentially decided this some
time ago and just defined HE_SPIN_LOCK to be spin_lock_irqsave.
the lock probably needs to be more fine-grained though in the
tasklet handler though.
