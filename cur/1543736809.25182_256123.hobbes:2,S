That would not work either.
request_irq() clears the enable/disable depth
only when registering the first device on that
interrupt.
If a device is sharing an interrupt with e100
and calls request_irq() before e100, then the
disable_irq() requires a matching enable_irq().
If e100 is the only or first device on
that interrupt, then the enable_irq() causes
the warning because the depth has been reset.
It is interesting behavior for request_irq.
I don't know if it was planned that way,
or is an unexpected artifact.
It makes the effect of the disable_irq call
indeterminate (to the driver) if made
before registering with the interrupt.
