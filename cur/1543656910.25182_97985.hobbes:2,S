    Hi Joshua :)

    First, you do not sound stupid at all.
    Second. The do...while use in macros is to avoid the 'swallow
semicolon' effect ;)) In other words, it makes the entire macro
appear as a single statement. This avoids problems with 'else'
constructs with macros that expand to multiple statements.
    Someplace in the GNU cpp documentation you can find a far better
explanation of this effect and why the do...while helps (it makes the
macro a single statement...).
    Hope that helps :)
