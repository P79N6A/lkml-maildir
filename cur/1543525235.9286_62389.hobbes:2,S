Read "the list". It's being worked on. I was one of the persons that
discovered the change. The guy that's working on it says he's going
to make it possible to read new pointers rather than just old data
space.
This means that:
	strcpy(argv[0], "Overwrite the command line and environment");
.. which is dangerous... Will eventually allow:
	argv[0] = "New string of whatever length you want";
This allows backwards compatibility as well as forwards. Right now,
if you have a copy of your `init` source, just do:
        char tmp_buf0[0x08];   /* Room for "init" */
        char tmp_buf1[0x08];   /* Room for "auto" */
	strcpy(tmp_buf0, argv[0]);
        strcpy(tmp_buf1, argv[1]);
        argv[0] = (char *) malloc(0x100);
        argv[1] = (char *) malloc(0x100);
        strcpy(argv[0], tmp_buf0);
        strcpy(argv[1], tmp_buf1);
This makes lots of room for future children so you don't have to
modify any of them.
Cheers,
