If you want another datapoint, this doesn't help on my own Xircom card.
The only way to make it receive packets while not in promisc mode was
to add back the "+ 4" to the buffer address in the descriptor -- reverting
one of the changes that went into 3.1.21.
Anything else I've tried didn't help: filling up all slots with my MAC,
adding them at the end of the list, at the beginning, as little/big endian,
in reverse order... you name it. The "+ 4" however made it work reliably.
The card is a Xircom RealPort CardBus Ethernet 10/100, code RBE-100. This
is the lspci entry for it:
20:00.0 Class 0200: 115d:0003 (rev 03)
        Subsystem: 115d:0181
        Flags: bus master, medium devsel, latency 64, IRQ 11
        I/O ports at 0200
        Memory at a000d000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable)
        Memory at a000c000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable)
        Expansion ROM at a0008000 [disabled]
        Capabilities: [dc] Power Management version 1
Thanks,
Ion
