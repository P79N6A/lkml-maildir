Relicensing the whole kernel under the CDDL just to be able to get ZFS is
not going to happen (I bet that rewriting ZFS is easier than relicensing a
large piece of software with thousand of different copyrigth owners ;)
Either Sun relicenses Solaris under a GPL-compatible license (which may
happen, as Sun's CEO has said they may relicense it under the GPL3), or
Linux won't get ZFS except using the FUSE backend. If you miss ZFS, you
always can use solaris.
