I don't quite understand what you are getting at, but if you don't want to
sleep you should be able to use a non blocking syscall. But in some cases
I think there are times when you may not be able to use a non blocking call.
And if a process is a CPU hog, its a CPU hog. If its not its not. Doesn't
matter how it would behave on another system.
