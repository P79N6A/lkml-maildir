This really shouldn't matter.
When we enter the kernel through "int 0x80", we don't need to do anything 
about TIF_SINGLESTEP, because unlike the "sysenter" path, the "int" 
instruction will automatically do the right thing (save old eflags on the 
stack).
So afaik, this won't actually do anything (except make _the_ most 
timing-critical path in the kernel slower). Have you actually seen any 
effects of it?
