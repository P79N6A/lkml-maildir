It is maybe not clearly named. smp_wmb() is a memory barrier to the
regular (eg. RAM) cache coherency domain AFAICT. wmb() is also a
barrier to io memory.
There is nothing to distinguish SMP and UP. I guess sometimes smp_
barriers would not even have to be a barrier() on UP, but other
times they would have to be (eg. in the case of concurrent
interrupts, context switches).
