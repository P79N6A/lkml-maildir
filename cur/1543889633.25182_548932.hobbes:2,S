No. If the write fails, then NFS will mark the mapping as invalid and
attempt to call invalidate_inode_pages2() at the earliest possible
moment.
I'm adding in a patch to defer marking the page as uptodate until the
write is successful in cases where NFS is writing a pristine page.
As for pages that are already marked as uptodate, well you already have
a race: you have deferred the page write, and so other processes may
already have read the rejected data before you tried to write it out.
