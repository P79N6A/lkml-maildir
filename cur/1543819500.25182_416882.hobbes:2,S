In fs/lockd/svcshare.c, nlmsvc_share_file and nlmsvc_unshare_file do
compare the xdr_netobj->data field, which contains the snprinted
system_utsname.nodename.
However, if you're going to unshare utsname() and change your nodename,
the effect should be no different than if you just changed your
nodename :)  So I don't see this being a problem.
