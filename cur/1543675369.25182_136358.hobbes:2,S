Well, I'm concerned rather about cases when user buffer ends up in non
DMA-able memory than small or misaligned buffers. I mean those who have
system with loads of RAM didn't do anything wrong, yet they get
"punished." But I'm not actually insisting! Just saying that it *might*
be worth reconsidering "ide-cd won't do dma without bio setup" clause or
retry bio_map_user on kalloc-ed buffer. At least for transfers not
smaller than say 2K:-)
Cheers. A.
