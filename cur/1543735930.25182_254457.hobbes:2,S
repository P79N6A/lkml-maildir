Lspci shows me that my new pci device is not present.
Scanpci does show the device.  What I'd like to do
Is get the kernel to know about it and then be able to
See it with an lspci.
Can you tell me how with lspci or setpci?
Thanks again,
Dave:)

Did you try `setpci` and `lspci`?
You can sometimes get things working without resorting to a boot.
