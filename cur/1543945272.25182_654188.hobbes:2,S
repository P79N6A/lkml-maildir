My personal view (which seems to be in the minority) is that it's a
waste of our development time *except* in the (rare?) cases similar to
the ones Andi is talking about.
But the decision has already been made for us in the block layer: 
dm is now pretty much required to support (zero-length) barriers.
Unfortunately we didn't get this finished in time for 2.6.25, but we
intend to get it done for 2.6.26:  Woe betide any callers today that
don't handle EOPNOTSUPP!
