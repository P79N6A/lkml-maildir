From kernel v2.3.35 and onwards (v2.3.36pre1 - pre3) I get this message
when compiling the kernel (gcc 2.7.2.3). My guess is that it's something
in fs/ext2/super.c that isn't liked by gcc 2.7.2.x. Given that noone else
has reported this error, it must work for at least some people...
fs/fs.o: In function `exit_ext2_fs':
fs/fs.o(.text.init+0x706): undefined reference to `unregister_filesystem'
A Happy New Year to you all that use the Gregorian Calendar.
