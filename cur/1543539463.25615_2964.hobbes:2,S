If you can prevent such "technically incorrect" commands in RELIABLE way then
such patch should be accepted IMVHO. Sometihing like capabilities check
(so you can forbid access to /dev/kmem, HDIO_DRIVE_CMD and some other
dangerous things and thus GUARANTEE that even root can not break the jail),
but such check already there (or I'm wrong?). Filtering is just stupid thing
to do: it's rejected by same reason as non-executable stack: works as
short-term solution, does not work as long term solution and adds kludges in
mainstream kernel (you can track lkml archives if you forgot non-executable
stack discussions). Your fix is MUCH less intrusive and thus more acceptable
still it's in the same league.

See above.

If you can damage your drive via HDIO_DRIVE_CMD then IDE standard is
just stupid - we knew it for long time anyway so it's not something new
and/or exciting. It can not be fixed with fitering in kernel, though.
