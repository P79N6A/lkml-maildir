If it is root that is writing, it will use the reserved space anyway so
depending on the reserved size it will take longer or shorter for
root to fill the fs whiel others can't write to it.
There might be fs that will not have any root activity, so a root cushion
is not needed. If for some reason you need emergency space you can always
borrow from other fs.

If the reserved space is used for allocations then in the end also the
reserved space will be fragmented. In that case it all depends on the
dynamics on the fs. But sooner or later you will need to defragment in
order to improve fs performance and restore the contigious reserved
space.
I think it just depends on the use of the filesystem how much reserved
space you might need. A sort of archive fs for example might be used
for copying old files to it without ever deleting them. As the
files are created and written one after the other you need no reserved
space as a cushion and fragmentation will not be an issue. On the
other hand an 'news' filesystem is much more dynamic and might very
well benifit from a big reserved space...
It is not that I question the use of reserved space. I just want to have
finer control over it. In the end it is just a tuning parameter. The
default can still be 5%. Allowing fraction percentages might also do
the job...
