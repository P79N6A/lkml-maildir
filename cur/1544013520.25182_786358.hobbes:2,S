*shrug*  I poke my head into kernel development every few months, and have 
just enough familiarity with it to remember that "changes go in during the 
merge window".  Seemed a good time to post 'em.

Since you're turning down an existing patch in favor of a theoretical patch, I 
assume you have plans to do this yourself?

What if they run out of disk space halfway through writing a file and thus it 
creates a short file (or a 0 length file where the dentry was created but no 
blocks could be allocated for the write)?
I expected headers_install to overwrite destination files and create 
directories with -p, so if you interrupt it you can just re-run it again with 
the same arguments and it could install everything again cleanly over existing 
partial output.  I take it this isn't what's happening, or that isn't 
sufficient somehow?
I didn't look too closely at what the makefile was doing (it makes my eyes 
bleed), I just rewrote the perl script and changed the call.  I could try to 
upgrade the script to not need the makefile to tell it what files to work on, 
and just take the appropriate top level include directory and the output 
directory and figure out which files it needs to operate on by itself so it 
_does_ work that way.  Figuring out where the make file is getting this info 
from now shouldn't be too much harder than reading perl scripts and figuring 
out what they're doing.
Not during this merge window, though.

Good luck with that.  Having written most of the busybox sed implementation, 
and before that having written my own regex implementation back under OS/2, 
I've pretty much gotten my fill of doing regexes in C, at least without a good 
reason.
I suppose if I was feeling really bored I could try to implement unifdef as a 
sed script, but the only way to get a single invocation of sed to work on a 
bunch of individual files coherently is to use -i mode, which A) ain't in 
susv3 (although busybox sed supports it), B) would involve a cp of all the 
files to the destination first, which is kind of ugly.

The shell version is less readable but you never noticed that the perl version 
isn't using its $ARCH argument?  *shrug*  Ok.
I can try to make the shell version more readable, and more powerful.  It's 
already noticeably faster than the perl version.  I have no objections to 
making unifdef do all of this, I just haven't got any interest either.
