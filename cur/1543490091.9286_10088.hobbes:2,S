Hi,
our security team of SuSE GmbH noticed a
security problem with the access permissions
to /proc (kernel 2.0.36).
When a (non-root) user executes a SUID program
s/he is able to read /proc/<pid_of_suid_proc>/stat.
The stat file includes the adress of the stackpointer,
which is necessary for exploiting bufferoverflows.
(One of the hardest parts of bufferoverflow exploits
is to guess the stackpointer value.)
This simpilfication is just usefull for bufferoverruns,
which are exploitable after the execution of a SUID
program.
Please, send your comments to thomas@suse.de, because
I'm not subscribed to this mailinglist... thanks.
Bye,
     Thomas
