I agree.  I will have to look closer but unless there is more
juice than I have seen in Hyper-Transport it is going to become
one of the architectural bottlenecks of the Hammer.
Currently you get 1600MB/s in a single direction.  Not to bad.
But when the memory controllers get out to dual channel DDR-II 400,
the local bandwidth to that memory is 6400MB/s, and the bandwidth to
remote memory 1600MB/s, or 3200MB/s (if reads are as common as
writes).  
So I suspect bandwidth intensive applications will really benefit
from local memory optimization on the Hammer.  I can buy that the
latency is negligible, the fact the links don't appear to scale
in bandwidth as well as the connection to memory may be a bigger
issue.

The latter I really quite believe.  Even dual channel PC2100 can
exceed your interprocessor bandwidth.
And yes I have measured 2000MB/s memory copy with an Athlon MP and
PC2100 memory.
