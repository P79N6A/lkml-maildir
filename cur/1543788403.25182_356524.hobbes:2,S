Hi all,
I used to use orinoco-cvs from april 2005 together with waproamd and
kernel 2.6.11/12 without any trouble. However since 2.6.13 and also in
2.6.14-rc{2,3} waproamd first puts up the interface and initializes it
correctly and then somehow gets confused with ssid's and sets only a part
of it, e.g. instead of 'iamanssid': 'anssid'
wich of course kills the connection and then the process seems to go on
and on...
does anyone have an idea whether this is a kernel bug or one in waproamd ?
(this is on a pbook 15" 1GHz btw)
Soeren.
