Hi, Ingo:
To disable affinity, do configure --enable-public-release 
--disable-thread_affinity. You should see barrier overhead like the 
following:
Computing BARRIER time
Sample_size  Average     Min    Max          S.D.        Outliers
  20      19.486162   19.482250   19.491400    0.002740      0
BARRIER time =        19.486162 microseconds +/- 0.005371
BARRIER overhead =    8.996257 microseconds +/- 0.006575
The Reference_time_1 is the elapsed time for single thread doing simple 
loop without any synchronization. Thank you.
