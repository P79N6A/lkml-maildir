I see, ok. At that point though, having the message struct inside the task 
struct could save the *to pointer and (because of the big lock above), using 
barrier and proper order in setting *from and *info, the spin lock. OTOH 
the big lock above really make the global message structure private, so it 
does not make much difference.
