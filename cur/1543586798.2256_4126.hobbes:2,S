ERESTARTSYS is a part of the api between the driver and the
signal-handling code in the kernel. It does not reach user-space (provided
of course that it's used appropriately in the drivers :) 
When a driver needs to wait, and get awoken by a signal (as opposed to
what it's really waiting for) the driver should in most cases abort the
system call so the signal handler can be run (like, you push ctrl-c while
running somethinig that's stuck in a wait for an interrupt). The kernel
uses the ERESTARTSYS as a "magic" value saying it's ok to restart the
system call automagically after the signal handling is done. The actual
return-code is switched to EINTR if the system call could not be
restarted.
