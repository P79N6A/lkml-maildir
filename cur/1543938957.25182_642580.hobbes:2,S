Sure but the filesystems in fs/ are general purpose and they can be
mounted on top of any block device (except for the in-memory ones like
sysfs). Furthermore, the problem with iriverfs is that it assumes that
there can be only one device plugged to the host. What we want is
something like
  $ mount -t iriverfs /dev/iriver0 /mnt/media
Which can be accomplished with an USB driver in driver/usb/ that
registers the special iriverfs.
