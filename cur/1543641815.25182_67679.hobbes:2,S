But then in the _open_ syscall you don't need to send them from a copy.
However, since you need them in the later syscalls, you need to copy
them to the file structure for the later syscalls in open, but you don't
need to use copied credentials for the operation of opening a file
(assuming it's done synchronously within sys_open).
Anyway this is only relevant to decide whether to always copy uid and
gid or to use copy-write on them and access them with an extra memory
read (to read the pointer to the copy-on-write structure), which is not
the main issue.
BTW, imho a correctly designed network filesystem should have a single
stateful encrypted connection (or a pool of equally authenticated ones)
and credentials (i.e. passwords) should only be passed when the user
makes the first filesystem access. After that the server should do
authentication with the OR of all credentials received and the client
kernel should further decide whether it can give access to a particular
user.
This is off-topic here, though.

Yes, I agree with the need to provide copy-on-write.
I just disagree with the idea that code should be written to handle
changing credentials and that credentials should be passed as parameters
and I suggest that always copying uid and gid might be better since
accessing uid and gid is more frequent and happens in faster paths than
copying credentials.
