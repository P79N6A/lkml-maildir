Jes, it is not necessary since linux-2.0 or so...
All the difference with softnet is that you need not _test_ tbusy
on entry. That's all, nothing more.
So, you do:
#if (LINUX_VERSION_CODE < 0x02032b)
	if (test_bit(&tbusy, 0))
		return 1;
#endif
on entry to start_xmit.
All the rest of code is invariant for 2.0, 2.2, 2.4, provided
netif_* macros are defined for earlier kernels.
