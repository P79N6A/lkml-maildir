That's easy enough to fix. I'll do it.

I assume by this that you're objecting to the initialization of
/smack/tmp to point to /moldy/<label>.
Over the years I've seen a number of cases where failure to
set up /tmp result in unhappy consequences. If /tmp is anything
other than a real directory on the root filesystem it is important
that special care be taken for the case where things don't get
set up right for some reason. By including a specific, if perhaps
arbitrary, default it becomes easier to create a configuration
that survives the unexpected.

As you can only have /smack mounted once, this isn't an issue,
but it does present an interesting use case that brings the one
mount limitation into question. I'll add addressing this to the
short term todo list.

Because you throw "simple" out the window when you require userland
assistance to perform this function.

I'm having some trouble seeing how the 60 lines of code in
smackfs dealing with symlinks would be improved by your suggestions.
I certainly don't see how requiring userland intervention would
do anything but make it bigger and less reliable.
