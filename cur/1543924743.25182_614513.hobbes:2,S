Subject: Re: [PATCH 1/5] Small ACPICA extension to be able to store the name of operation regions in osl.c later
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/11/6/19

this patch introduces a compile error:
drivers/acpi/osl.c:1203: error: conflicting types for 'acpi_os_validate_address'
include/acpi/acpiosxf.h:243: error: previous declaration of 'acpi_os_validate_address' was here
which the next patch fixes.  This breaks git-bisection and will cause great
gnashing of teeth to those who hit it.
Also, please fix this:
drivers/acpi/osl.c: In function 'acpi_os_validate_address':
drivers/acpi/osl.c:1365: warning: format '%llx' expects type 'long long unsigned int', but argument 4 has type 'long unsigned int'
drivers/acpi/osl.c:1365: warning: format '%s' expects type 'char *', but argument 5 has type 'long unsigned int'
it's all covered in Documentation/SubmitChecklist but it seems that
file was write-only.
<goes back to fixing build errors>
