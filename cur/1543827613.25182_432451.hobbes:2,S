That is how the basic architecture specific PDA works (asm/pda.h)
But i don't see a good way to define a big struct for asm/percpu.h
Preprocessing would be too slow and getting all people to put
their per CPU variables into a single header also doesn't seem
like a good idea.

It's an assembler/linker issue.
