I saw some unexplained time warping while using the source at this url,
http://www.atnf.csiro.au/people/rgooch/benchmarks/linux-scheduler.html
it was on an older 2.6.18 based -rt .. The system would print the time
warp warning, then hang .. I applied something similar to the patch I
just sent, and the time warp warning was gone but the system still hung.
New -rt version don't hang, and I don't see the warning .. However, I
suspect the time warp warning was a side effect of the hang..
The system hang was resolved by changing the irq threads to all prio
50 ..
