There's really nothing to be tuned. If NCQ is enabled for your drive, it
will be printed in dmesg after the lba48 flag, such as:
ata1: dev 0 ATA, max UDMA/133, 488281250 sectors lba48 ncq
If you don't see NCQ there, your drive/controller doesn't support it.
Likewise you will have a queueing depth of > 1 if NCQ is enabled, check
/sys/block/sdX/device/queue_depth to see what the configured queueing
depth is for that device.
