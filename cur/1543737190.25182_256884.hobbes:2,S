Hi All,
I am not able to figure out what is the difference between the Header
Cache and the Neighbour structure.
The function I am looking into is ip_finish_output2() (ip_output.c). In
that function the kernel is checking whether the dst_entry for a skb
contains 'hh' or 'neighbour'. It then calls the output function of one of
them.
What I am confused about is that, when going through the code, I found
that hh->output and neighbour->output, both point to dev_queue_xmit. Is
this correct ? And if so, then what is the difference between dst->hh and
dst->neighbour.
I would appreciate your advice and comments
Thanks,
Rahul.
