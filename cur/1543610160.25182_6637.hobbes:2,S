   I didnt make these changes and it would seem we can link IO address <->
   pci bus,dev,fn in other ways, if it turns out many drivers cannot use u64
   for IO ports then we will have to investigate them.
Any driver which cannot handle PCI I/O resources being an unsigned
long is completely broken.
They are 64-bits on Sparc64 already, and this is the type of
PCI resource values.
