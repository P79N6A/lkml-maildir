So something like a /dev/entropy where user-mode can get direct access to all
the current collected entropy.  A daemon could read /dev/entropy, /dev/i810rng
and whatever else, mush it all up, compute the amount of real entropy and
write it back to /dev/random with an ioctl to update its available entropy.
If /dev/entropy is closed, then /dev/random could revert to its current mode of
operation, where system noise is fed in directly with a conservative count of
entropy bits.
Is that what you mean?
