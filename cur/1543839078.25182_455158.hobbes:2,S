Desktop volume management stuff is already doing it.  When I connect my 
ipod, it shows up as IPOD on my desktop regardless of which sd letter it 
gets.  Also, recent distributions use LABEL= tricks to find out root and 
other partitions to mount on boot.
The major/minor number and device name (which is determined by udev) 
aren't that important already and will become less of an issue as time 
passes.
