This just means that a table needs to be kept in sync between glibc and
netlink, and if someone e.g. gets a new CBQ module he would need to update
glibc. It's also bad for maintainers, because patches for tables of number 
tend to always reject ;) 
Textual error messages are e.g. used by plan9 and would be somewhat similar
to /proc. It would probably waste a few bytes in the kernel, but that's not
too bad, given the work it saves. e.g. rusty's code usually has a debug option 
that you can set and where each EINVAL outputs a error message; i always found 
that very useful and sometimes hacked that into other subsystems in my 
private tree.
