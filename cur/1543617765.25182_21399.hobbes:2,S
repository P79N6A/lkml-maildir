Marcelo, please do not apply this patch...
Sorry for the delay, review:
1) (in code, not in your patch) prefer kernel-standard types like u32 or
u16 to __u32 and __u16
2) poor formatting:

3) I don't like this playing around with magic numbers.  pci_set_master
and pci_enable_device and pci_disable_device twiddle PCI_COMMAND bits,
too.  Use constants from pci.h make it clear what bits you are clearing,
and what bits you are setting.

4) Your code appears to -always- set cache line size to zero.  Is that a
hardware bug?  Look at acenic.c to see a better example of setting PCI
cache line size.
5) what is the purpose of the spin_lock in streamer_open, if open is
serialized?  it worries me that the previous streamer_open code disabled
interrupts and the new one does not, but replaces with a non-irq-saving
lock that appears superfluous.
6) udelay(1) after brand new spin_lock in streamer_interrupt is
suspicious
7) disabling interrupts by zeroing NIC intr mask, in interrupt handler,
is general not needed.  why was this added?  interrupt handlers are not
re-entered so this is not a worry.
8) the while loop in the interrupt looks like it could go on for quite a
while under heavy load, starving out a lot of other kernel code.  it
needs a work limit at the very least...
9) disabling interrupts at the beginning of each TX is wrong.  you
probably want spin_lock_irqsave at critical parts of the xmit.
10) udelay(100) is likely wrong and a sign of a race (perhaps #9, above,
fixes this)
11) replacing save_flags/cli with normal spin_lock in streamer_close is
suspicious and likely wrong.  See issue #5 about streamer_open
serialization.  Have you read Documentation/networking/netdevices.txt ?
12) formatting of streamer_ioctl is grossly different from the rest of
the code
13) SIOCDEVPRIVATE ioctls are going away in 2.5.  (you can implement
include/linux/ethtool.h SIOCETHTOOL interface for lot of the
functionality, though)
