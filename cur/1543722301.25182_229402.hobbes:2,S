Is the 60% mainly kernel or user time now?  There were some good ideas in this 
thread that we could use to speed up symbol table searching.  And if opening 
and reading /proc/kallsyms is taking a significant portion of the time, we 
could probably trim it down too by only reading it once and polling for 
module insertion/removal.
