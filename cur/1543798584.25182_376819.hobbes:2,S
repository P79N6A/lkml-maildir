I don't see it as md specific.  
Suppose I want to change the IO scheduler under the filesystem /foo.
I look that up in mtab and find it is mounted on /dev/blah.
To find the corresponding /sys/block entry I have to search.  That's
fine if I only have a few block devices.  But I keep hearing storing
of people with thousands.  Having to search just feels clumsy.

Well, maybe it'll be a good excuse to learn more about 'class' and
'class_device' anyway.
