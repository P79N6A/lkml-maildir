Trivial fix.  Add "export DEPMOD=/bin/true" if you want to suppress
depmod.  Or point at a 2.3.13 or later depmod that you installed in
your own directory if you want to run a newer depmod.  This is why all
the program names are defined as variables in the Makefile.

/lib/modules/xxx/build is only useful if you are installing on the same
system you compile on but there is no field in the Makefile that says
"I am going to install on another machine".  Add
rm -f $INSTALL_MOD_PATH/lib/modules/*/build
to the end of your script.

Absolutely, you just need to supply some more overrides.
