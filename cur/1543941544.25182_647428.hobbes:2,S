APIC: 4bit
xAPIC: 8bit?
x2APIC: 32bit? 4g logical cpu?
patch from SGI for 4096cpu/512node will use apicid as 16 bits, but
actually still use only from 8 bit.
they may wait from Intel release code for x2APIC support for extend
that to 16 bit.
x2APIC will use MSR instead of MMIO to access. that is good.
we don't need to go over mptable or ACPI madt to find phyaddress for local apic.
current code could work well with 8bit local APIC, and 4 bit IOAPIC.
I tried with lifting local apic id to 0x80 or 0x40 above, and io apic
for 0 in linuxbios then load kernel 2.6.21 ( one year ago). it worked
well
