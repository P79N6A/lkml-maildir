hi,
during the last days i noticed that my box is using a lot of swap 
memory. it does the same things as every time, perhaps some application 
is leaking memory, i don't know / will examine. then i was away a few 
days and back again i found a partition of mine unmounted. in my syslog 
i noticed this message:
VFS: Busy inodes after unmount. Self-destruct in 5 seconds.  Have a nice 
day...
i *think* this is the message just before unmounting the fs, but the OOM 
event was hours before, as the (slightly edited) log says:
http://www.nerdbynature.de/bits/sheep/2.6.9-rc3/messages.log
(the VFS warning is at the end)
maybe someone could have a look at it and explain to me what happened here?
this is all on debian/unstable, vanilla 2.6.9-rc3 compiled with 3.4.2, 
loop-aes modules loaded. the said fs which was (un)mounted is this:
/dev/hda1 on /data/Media type ext3 
(rw,noexec,nosuid,nodev,noatime,loop=/dev/loop5,\
gpgkey=/root/keys/hda1.gpg,encryption=twofish128)
evil@sheep:~$ free -m
              total   used   free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:           250   210      40          0          2         67

thank you,
Christian.
