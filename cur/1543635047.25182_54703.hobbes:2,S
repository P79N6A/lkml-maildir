Can be anything. The disk's administration parts getting messed up with 
crap, and already having got messed up by some test run right after 
production. Or maybe the drives were padded with maintainer data before 
they were shipped (means, after production).
Imagine it thermodynamically. A half-ordered system keeps getting messed 
up. Somewhen it's messed up. If you order your system it will take longer 
for the drive to get messed up.
Maybe the part which failed in the old firmware was some garbage 
collection code? Something that removes the crap?
