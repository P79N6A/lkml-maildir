So what method exists for opening a file/device an guaranteeing that
nothing else can do anything to it?
Looking an man 2 open, I can't even see any way O_EXCL even has a normal
meaning for a device, so how much more "weird and non-standard" would it
be to have it control exclusive access to a device?  It appears it is
only supposed to have a meaning for creating files.
