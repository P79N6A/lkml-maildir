No. Since we don't know when the upper layers (including the journaling layer) 
wants to fsync, we call it everytime. But they pass this information. Chris 
Lightfoot implemented write barriers just before the API was changed, 
together with much of the other stuff I'm talking about.
It's impressive to check his original mail - the scenario with create a 32M 
file + delete it, where delete takes a minute on vanilla and 1 second on his 
patched code. I've downloaded the patch for future reference, even if I don't 
know when I'll have time to look at it.
