Eventually I was able to reproduce it. The oops was the same as before,
from swapoff at shutdown.
What I did this time was to boot with mem=32M, and just run a silly
'cd /; tar cf - . --totals > /dev/null' command.
/proc/swaps showed no swap usage before shutdown, but apparently
something bad happended anyway.
(Running under Simics is slow enough that I don't build the kernels
or anything else on the "box" itself. So it only sees brief boot-and-
see-if-it-works-then-shutdown usage.)
