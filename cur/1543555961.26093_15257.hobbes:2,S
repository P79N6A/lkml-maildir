That makes no sense - how do you count the descriptors in shared ->files?
And how on the Earth do you count SCM_RIGHTS packets? Because they make
a great way to fool any use of that stuff for resource-limit type of
applications (stash the descriptors into SCM_RIGHTS cookie, send them to
yourself and close them).
Basically, I don't see what are you counting.
