Not early at all ? We have userspace processes running.. this is _late_
in the boot sequence! ;)
Anyhow, that I have now is a combination including your proposal :
- I dump the swapon/swapoff events.
- I also dump the equivalent of /proc/swaps (with kernel internal
  information) at trace start to know what swap files are currently
  used.
Does it sound fair ?
