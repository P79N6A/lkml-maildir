Hi,
We have noticed that do_bottom_half leaves interrupts disabled on the local
cpu when it exits,
This results in the tq_scheduler task queue sometimes running with
interrupts disabled.
Which has been causing some sad happenings in our code,we were not
expecting this & it
has caused some grief in drivers.
It has been suggested that this is required to prevent infinite recursion
in do_bottom_half,
I have been using this to do things like starting kernel threads it hasn't
crashed yet but
I have a friend whose code did deadlock because of this.
I know I could keep a thread permanently running & wake it up when
neccessary but this is a little wasteful.
Suggestions/Opinions.
