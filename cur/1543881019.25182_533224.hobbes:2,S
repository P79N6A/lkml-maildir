Jeff, your patch doesn't resolve, but you hit the problem. Actually, I
think the xattr_root pointer must be protected also in get_xa_root()
using the same private root i_mutex.
I've tested the following patch and it resolves in my case. What do you
think about it? could it be a reasonable fix?
Thanks!
