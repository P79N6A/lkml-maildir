Hi all
I have one idea , and this is about expand virtual memory on linux boxes 
connected in LAN.
Example: Linux A is processing come information , and need more memory , so 
with this source , Linux A could access virtual memory on Linux B in LAN.
But i don´t know how translate the virtual address between Linux A and B , to 
have success in acess VM, or how to send all the process for Linux B to be 
processed.
Any ideas ?
Thanks
Breno
