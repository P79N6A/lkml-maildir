Well ... legacy APIs allow "-1" there; /proc/driver/rtc certainly
interprets wildcards consistently too.  That is, historically it's
not been legit to call rtc_tm_to_time(&t->time).
A counter-argument could be made that rtc_read_alarm() should get
rid of wildcards.  It's got the right RTC in hand; rtc_tm_to_time()
doesn't.  Other RTCs can have this same type of "wildcard" issue.
Me, I'd prefer to make the API treat alarms as purely oneshot.
That whole "wildcard" model is, as you noted, awkward ... even
though it's got hardware support in cases like MC146818 and clones,
it's not very portable.  But I don't want to push that issue either
way just now.

I was wondering about that in the context of a different RTC, which
happens to run on BIOS-less hardware.  Which, curiously, may be the
opposite of BIOS-impaired hardware ... :)
In general, I suspect the alarm should stay active ... unless its
time has already passed.  That was the original intent of that
tweak, but of course PCs don't actually *have* oneshot alarms, so
there's no way to tell if a given alarm is in the past.  Leading to
the conclusion that AIE should probably stay enabled.
