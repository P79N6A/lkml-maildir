I did mean RAID-0 combined with RAID-5. You can search for RAID-50 for
more info. The configuration you describe (RAID-5s combined into a mirror)
would have a disk overhead that is worse than RAID-10/RAID-0+1. For two
5-disk RAID-5s combined into a RAID-1 you end up using six of your disks
for parity and disk mirroring:
  RAID-1 --------> RAID-5 (D0,D1,D2,D3,P0)
              |--> RAID-5 (D0,D1,D2,D3,P0)
   (four disks used for data, only one from each RAID-5 can fail)
With RAID-10:
  RAID-0 --------> RAID-1 (D0,D0)
              |--> RAID-1 (D1,D1)
              |--> RAID-1 (D2,D2)
              |--> RAID-1 (D3,D3)
              |--> RAID-1 (D4,D4)
   (five disks used for data, one from each mirror can fail)
With RAID-50:
  RAID-0 --------> RAID-5 (D0,D2,D4,D6,P0)
              |--> RAID-5 (D1,D3,D5,D7,P0)
   (two disks wasted only one from each RAID-5 can fail)
I believe that I/O performance would be similar for each
configuration. I'll try to run some tests in the next few days.

Mirroing doesnt hit the CPU nearly as much as RAID-5 does. I suspect
RAID-6 would incur greater overhead because of its double parity blocks.
But, there's no point in arguing about kernel RAID-6 without data to back
it up.
