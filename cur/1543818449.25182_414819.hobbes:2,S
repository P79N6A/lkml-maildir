Well that was a pita.  I was using that file in my kernel installation

Your changelog says what the patch does, but gives no indication of why it
did it.
What do we get back for the breakage which this will cause?
Now I'm going to have to look for both .kernelrelease and
include/config/kernel.release and work out which one has the more recent
mtime.  grr.
