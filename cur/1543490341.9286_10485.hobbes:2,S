Linux 2.2.3ac1 contains
o	ARM updates - working to merge ARM with my tree then eventually I
	hope with Linus - tho that may be a 2.3 job
o	V7 file system tweaks to sys5 1K
o	Improved SCSI generic (still the mark 1 edition) - Douglas
	has some improvements in the pipeline before it goes to Linus
o	The Large file array patch. I still hope to feed this to Linus at
	some point
o	i386 security hole fix for ptrace. Its in the other architectures
	too. It only bites if you use capabilities. The bigger hole in
	/proc is fixed in 2.2.3
o	AMD K6 MSR/MTRR setup. The MSR is ready to go to Linus now, and
	will do so, the MTRR stuff I hope will get merged with Richard
	Gooch stuff once its untangled from devfs
o	ADFS update. Strictly for Acorn fans
o	CDROM updates. Heading Linuswards soon
o	Better bw-qcam driver.
o	Printing fixes. I assume Tim will send these to Linus himself when
	he's finally happy
o	3c509 update - for EISA etc - queued for Linus
o	Wavelan update - queued for Linus
o	cs89x0 module parameters - queued for Linus
o	Sealevel sync driver. Awaiting confirmation it works on the real
	board as well as my test rig
o	SCSI blacklist and AIC7xxx updates
o	Prototype ESS PCI and Yamaha PCI legacy mode drivers. Gus SMP fix
o	NTFS doesnt crash when you run out of memory
o	/proc/mem crash fixes for threaded abuse programs
o	NFS: Im still merging together Linus & Trond's code. Once Trond
	has all the nice stuff finally tuned up with Linus this will all
	become main tree stuff. Im just making sure it gets tested 8)
o	NFSroot argument bug
o	Misc include/time wrap bug fixes
