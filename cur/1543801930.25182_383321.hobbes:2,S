damn, you know I had seen this on one machine only, and the machine
had other problems, so i thought it wasn't e100.  I can't quite figure
out why we haven't seen this more often given how long the bug appears
to have existed.

Agreed, but once again I am simply amazed this has been there so long.
I think these are both good patches and I'll ack this and absorb it
for our next release.  It will be a bit before its completely through
our process but its okay with me if this goes into the kernel now.
