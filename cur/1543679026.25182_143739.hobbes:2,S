I did make the effort to make a dedicated bug database for kernel
development in December last year.  Do people actively hate it, or are
they just not aware of it?  :-).  I got some very favourable comments
early on, and a review in a Linux magazine, but haven't had much
feedback recently about it.  I was specifically trying to address the
kind of problems we're seeing with Bugzilla...
