No, that static mapping is not good. I have an external enclosure that
does firewire and USB. I want to be able to use "sony-dvd" to access
it no matter whether it is onnected to USB bus or Firewire and whether
there are other devices (disks) on USB or firewire. It is possible to
do with udev creating a link to /dev/sony-dvd.
