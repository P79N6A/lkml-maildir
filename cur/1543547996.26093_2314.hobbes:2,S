Absolutely not true.  You're probably thinking about kgdb, the gdb
stub for remote kernel source level debugging.
kdb is a dedicated low-level kernel debugger.  It hasn't been
"hacked".  It was never designed for user space.  It doesn't do
source-level debugging, though --- it's very much a low-level
poke-around-the-kernel tool.
Cheers,
 Stephen
