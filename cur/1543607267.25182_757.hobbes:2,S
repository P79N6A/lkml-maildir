The first thing I did was to kach the horrible nVidia's Makefile. For example,
it had the bad intention of compiling and installing against the running kernel
(guess kernel with uname -r). So when you update the kernel, you have to reboot
and make nVidia drivers. I changed it to:
+KREL:=`grep UTS_RELEASE /usr/src/linux/include/linux/version.h | cut -d\" -f2`
-KERNDIR:=/lib/modules/$(shell uname -r)
+KERNDIR:=/lib/modules/$(KREL)
so it builds against a built but not-running kernel.
