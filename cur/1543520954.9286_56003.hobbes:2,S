Dear all:
Is there anyone know about any available tool that can trace the kernel
source code?
and where can I get it ?
Or is there anyone who can provide experiences in tracing kernel source
code?
I'm really fed up with the terrible long source code.
It's simply too terrible to trace line by line and function by function.
