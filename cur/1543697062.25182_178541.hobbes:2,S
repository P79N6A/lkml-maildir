The reason why I didn't use pread(2) is because I have to do multiple
calls to read(2). There is no way that I know of to pack more than a
single page into a single read(2) with seq_file API.
Yes, I remember Al saying "it's not a page" but in practice it still
appears to be limited to a page unless someone shows a sample seq_file
module which can provide more than a page of data on a single read(2). The
implementations I have looked at in the kernel (e.g. mm/slab.c) are
limited to a single page per read(2).
Kind regards
