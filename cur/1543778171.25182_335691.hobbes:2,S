Jiffies are the basic time unit for kernel timers, hiding that fact gives 
users only wrong expectations about them.
I don't mind using helper functions, but constant conversion can already 
happen at compile time and for variable timeouts the user should seriously 
consider using jiffies directly instead of constantly converting time 
values.
