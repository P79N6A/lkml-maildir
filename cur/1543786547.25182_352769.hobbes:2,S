This is a buglet in "git fetch", which only happens with rsync, I think.

Ignore it. It gives this warning because I don't have an alternates 
directory, but it really shouldn't. _Most_ archives don't have alternates.
It's fixed in the current git already. I thought it was fixed in 0.99.7 
already, but regardless, this error is harmless and should just be 
ignored.
