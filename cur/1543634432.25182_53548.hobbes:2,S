At first I did just add them as sanity checks, but later on I had the
same thought myself (get rid of drive->waiting_for_dma). So go ahead
with that.
BTW, I see you renamed the flags to channel->active. I think that's a
bit misleading, can't you just call it ->state or ->flags (or
->state_flags? :-)
