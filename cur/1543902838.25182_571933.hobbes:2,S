I am not a big fan of this approach as it forces distros to require
kexec-tools when building a kernel.  Even Joe Hacker who wants a custom
kernel (and not interested in kexec) would have to not only download the
kernel.src.rpm but kexec-tools just to build a kernel that probably
doesn't have kexec enabled.
I had to deal with a similar experience when providing a build dependency
on the unifdef package when create the kernel-headers rpm for RHEL-5.  A
lot of people were confused and upset by this dependency.  Luckily
upstream resolved this by just putting similar code in the kernel/scripts
directory and thus removing the dependency (well not for RHEL-5).  I would
rather not have to deal with this again unless I know there is a more
permanent solution that would remove this dependency.
After talking to Dave Anderson about this more, I start to understand why
Ken'ichi prefers to implement the new features in userspace instead of the
kernel (it makes things automatically work with older kernels), but I
still am not a big fan of it.  I was hoping for a complete in kernel
solution (that way you never need the vmlinux file).  Perhaps makedumpfile
can support both vmlinux files (if provided) or interface with the kernel
(if the vmlinux is not provided?).
Just my input.  I might as well argue with Ken'ichi here than the
bugzilla. :-)
Cheers,
Don
