I agree with you for the most part.
Herbert did say he submitted patches for the parts that were ready.  He
didn't say if he was working with Bart and Alan on the IDE changes though.
I haven't seen any messages from him on lkml with "patch" in the subject,
but that doesn't mean he's not working with the maintianers.
Herb, what do you have to say on this?
