If you want to prevent casual reads with user tools which don't physically
destroy the hardware, a single overwrite is probablt fine. If you think
someone would want the info enough to take the drive apart, encrypt
everything including swap and tmp, using DES3 or similar extremely hard
code.
You have to know your exposure, who will try to recover the data and how
hard they will try.
