Using the lockmeter on a 2.5.75 kernel, I discovered
that boomerang_interrupt() grabs a spinlock for over
1/4 second. No joke, 253 ms. Interrupts are off AFAIK.
Mouse behavior is terrible.
It should be no surprise that NTP isn't working too
well either. The ntpd daemon keeps complaining about
losing sync and having to advance the clock by amounts
of over 100 seconds.
Could somebody with the hardware manual take a look
at that function?
