The alternative is "noinline __init_refok" - the noinline is required 
because modern gcc versions already make it non-__init by inlining it 
into init_kmem_cache_nodes() without.
But I'm not convinced it's really worth manually forcing noinline only 
for moving a few bytes to __init in the CONFIG_NUMA=y case - in the  
long term this will only bit rot.
