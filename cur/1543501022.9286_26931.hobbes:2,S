I have 
Slackware 4.0 with default Kernel 2.2.6
P133
64 Ram
Adaptec 2940 SCSI
1 Gb SCSI Hdd
9 Gb SCSI Hdd
I am trying to compile 2.2.10 kernel. I only change the PCI NE200
Support on the default kernel configuration. 
I recompiled kernel with bzImage and I made bzlilo.
But when I restart system I got msg "kernel panic VFS fs not . . ." and
do not continue for booting.
I am sure that I make "Ok"  for Vfat, ext2 fs support and I select all
Adaptec Drivers for SCSI Drivers.
What you suggest ?
Best regards,
Oguz Demirkapi
