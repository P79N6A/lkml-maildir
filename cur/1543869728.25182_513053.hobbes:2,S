It's IBM:
$ ll /sys/class/backlight/
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 0 Feb 26 13:28 ibm
At the time the brightness goes low, there is '0' in 
/sys/class/backlight/ibm/actual_brightness and 
/sys/class/backlight/ibm/brightness
Echoing '7' into /sys/class/backlight/ibm/brightness gets the brightness 
back again to normal.

It doesn't blank at the time it dims - it just decreases brightness. I 
will do some more tests, but it seemed on a first sight that it happens 
only when the machine is idle.

I observed it only on console, but didn't experiment with it too much yet.
