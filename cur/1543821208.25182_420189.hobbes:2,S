Subject: [PATCH 003 of 11] md: Remove useless ioctl warning.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/5/1/9

This warning was slightly useful back in 2.2 days, but is more
an annoyance now.  It makes it awkward to add new ioctls (that we we are
likely to do that in the current climate, but it is possible).
