I expect we could take that approach in the current kernel, yes
(though it would put those compound tests into the bio code that
Jens was preferring to remove).  But I think not if your variable
page_cache_size went in: imagine an mmap of the tail component page
of an order-1 page_cache_size page, and that pte only being dirtied:
wouldn't set_page_dirty on that page need to redirect to the head?
