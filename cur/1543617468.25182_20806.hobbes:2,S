Well, I've heard good things about the driver, but on one of my machines it 
fails to boot _if_ the Maxtor 34098H4 (40 G) drive is connected using an 80 
wire cable to an htp366 controller. If I use a 40 wire cable, it runs just 
fine. 
I have been through six 80 wire cables, just in case they were the problem. 
However, the controller, drive and any of the 80 wire cables work just fine 
on several other machines!
I do notice that the machine gets further into the boot than it used to. 
Previously it would stall when mounting / with a error about 'waiting for 
interrupt', I believe. Now mounts / but fails claiming a file that is being 
loaded is corrupt. Swap the cables, and it is able to read the previously 
'corrupted' file! 
I suspect that the issue is that the machine is quite old, an HP dual 
Pentium 200 (hp xu5/120, upgraded). It's memory speed is only about 25 MB/s, 
which is slower than udma4! :)
