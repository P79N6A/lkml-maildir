Yup, that one, sorry Bart, I thought it was from you.
So far, a quirk grep shows such quirks only in powerpc code though, in
the chrp and powermac platforms (mostly the same one copied over). I'll
do a fix that re-allocate all resources on these instead (though I
suppose another option would be to just write the legacy addresses to
the BARs after turning it into native mode... probably even better).
Ben.
