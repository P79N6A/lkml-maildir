Wow, you have four devices on the same interrupt line. /proc/interrupts
from 2.4.26/27 looks the same?

You mean it boots but you get the Tx timeouts?

Well there are some changes to sis900 between .26 and .27 but I doubt
they could be causing it.
Can you try to boot with ACPI disabled? I think the problem might be 
related to ACPI configuration. 
Also, can you post the boot messages from 2.4.27?
