Subject: [PATCH] Replacing __SMP__ by CONFIG_SMP globally in linux-2.3.39.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

A patch that replaces __SMP__ by CONFIG_SMP throughout the linux-2.3.39
kernel source tree can be found at
	
http://www.image.dk/~nkbj/patches/config-smp-2.3.39.bz2
The patch can be applied to pre-patch-2.3.40-1 as well. Beware that
__SMP__ is no longer defined when the patch has been applied.
