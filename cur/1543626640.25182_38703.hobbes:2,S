Given that I want a relative offset, and I have explicitly coded a
relative offset, I don't see how that is a hack.  I see assembly
for is telling the machine explicitly what to do and that does.
The fact the correct way to code the instruction looks ugly is a gas
bug/deficiency.  Perhaps a gas developer will look at how ugly that
code is and improve gas.
One of the other reasons I want to do it this way is in case is to
make copying code easier.  If you use idioms that work equally well
everywhere and for every case it is easier to switch between projects
using the same tool.  And the assume 0 hack isn't useful when
switching from real to protected mode while using the code segment
you got from the reset vector.  Although it is kind of fun running
real mode code with a code segment base of 0xffff0000.
