Roland, is it possible that what you describe is the behaviour of older kernels?
Digging around in rmap.c, I see the following code in try_to_unmap_one:
        /*
         * Don't pull an anonymous page out from under get_user_pages.
         * GUP carefully breaks COW and raises page count (while holding
         * page_table_lock, as we have here) to make sure that the page
         * cannot be freed.  If we unmap that page here, a user write
         * access to the virtual address will bring back the page, but
         * its raised count will (ironically) be taken to mean it's not
         * an exclusive swap page, do_wp_page will replace it by a copy
         * page, and the user never get to see the data GUP was holding
         * the original page for.
         *
         * This test is also useful for when swapoff (unuse_process) has
         * to drop page lock: its reference to the page stops existing
         * ptes from being unmapped, so swapoff can make progress.
         */
        if (PageSwapCache(page) &&
            page_count(page) != page_mapcount(page) + 2) {
                ret = SWAP_FAIL;
                goto out_unmap;
        }

on 2004-06-05 , i.e. as far as I can see around 2.6.7, and the comment says:

Seems quite like the situation that you described. Does my analysis make sence?
Since this case seems to be explicitly handled,
it is probably safe to rely on this behaviour or try_to_unmap,
avoiding the need for mlock, is it not?
