Just to make sure I have this correct, an application can call brk to
allocate memory from its heap space for upto 1GB, after which it has to
switch to using mmap for the rest.  Is this 1GB fixed or will it ever
change? (if it does, it might break my application).

Which version of libc has malloc that uses mmap after 1GB?

But what if I have an application that doesent know how much memory it will
need?  My application is reading in a file, parsing it and constructing a
huge in-memory database.  Should I write my own library that will first mmap
a large (say 2 GB) memory and then dish out smaller chunks to the
application from there on an as need babsis?  This is what malloc should
really do.  What is the general approach taken for these kind of
applications?

It seems complicated for an application that wants to use a large amount of
memory to know that it first has to use brk then switch to mmap after a
1GB... or am I understanding this incorrectly?  It also might break
portability, right?

How do I do this?  Is this a kernel change?

Thank you all very much :)
