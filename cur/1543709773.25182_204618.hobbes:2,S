So the problem is that CPU_MASK_ALL includes cpus that are not currently
online.  So it has gone from being wrong by including too few cpus
to being wrong by including too many cpus.

Any chance we can fix this right and get a proper value in cpu_vm_mask
for init_mm?  All that needs to happen is that each cpu as it is
started up is included in cpu_vm_mask.
The reason kexec sees this is that it is possibly the only generic
modifier of init_mm. 
If fixing this needs to be kexec specific we need to simply remove
using init_mm.
