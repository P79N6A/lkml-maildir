David,
I have sent the bug to linux-net:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-net&m=105862200011155&w=2
Where it has been ignored too.
Also, I have searched into ipv4/README:
Maintainers and developers for networking code sections
Code Section            Bug Report Contact
-------------------+-------------------------------------------
ipv4                    davem@caip.rutgers.edu,Eric.Schenk@dna.lth.se
where:
<Eric.Schenk@dna.lth.se>: host himmelsborg.cs.lth.se[130.235.16.11] said: 550
    5.1.1 <Eric.Schenk@dna.lth.se>... User unknown (in reply to RCPT TO
    command)
Also, I have searched into arp.c (the file patched) and seen:
* Fixes:
 *              Alan Cox        :       Removed the Ethernet assumptions in
 *                                      Florian's code
So, I also e-mailed Alan... without reply so far.
David, do you think I need to send the bug and patch to anyone else? Just tell me.
Regards,
Carlos Velasco
