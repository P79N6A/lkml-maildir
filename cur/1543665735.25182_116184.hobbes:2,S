Well, yes, I use noatime by default, but I was thinking that there
might be users who wanted to gain most of the performance that using
noatime would, who still wanted access times available generally, but
who were not bothered about loosing them on an unclean shutdown.
Infact, taking this one step further, we could have assign directories
priorities, analogous to nice values for processes, and make the
lazyness of writes dependant on that.
So, for example, on a webserver, you could assign databases a high
priority for writes, but your webserver log a low priority.  If the
box crashed, the data most likely to be lost would be the webserver
log, rather than the database.
Another benefit would be that you could spin down disks, and not have
them spin up just to write data to the webserver log - that could be
committed to the disk just once an hour, but a database write could
cause it to spin up immediately.
John.
