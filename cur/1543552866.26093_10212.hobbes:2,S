Red Hat 7.0, i686, gcc-20001027 (Yes, I know. Just to flush out bugs on
both sides).
abs() is used at least in:
arch/i386/kernel/time.c
drivers/md/raid1.c
drivers/sound/sb_ess.c
gcc warns about use of a non-declared function each time.
No definition for the function is to be found (grep over all include/ comes
up clean, except for extern definitions in asm-{mips,ppc}; ditto for lib/).
Presumably gcc is using a builtin (it doesn't show up in System.map). Is
this the desired state of affairs? Should a include/linux/stdlib.h be
added, containing (for now, to be expanded later as needed, like
include/linux/stddef.h):
#ifndef _LINUX_STDLIB_H
#define _LINUX_STDLIB_H
extern int abs(int);
#endif
