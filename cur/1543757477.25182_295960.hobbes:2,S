pci_map_rom_copy and pci_remove_rom are there to support boards that
can't access their hardware and their ROM at the same time. These
boards are known to exist but nobody has updated a driver yet to use
the new routines. These should be left in place as the PCI spec
explicitly allows the non-simultaneous access case.
pci_remove_rom should probably be renamed to pci_remove_rom_copy.
