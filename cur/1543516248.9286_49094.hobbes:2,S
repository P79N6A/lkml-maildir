Subject: wrong binfmt link ordering - needs fixing

Hi,
I just noticed (by putting a printk("fmt=%08lx fn=%08lx\n") in
search_binary_handler() that with the current state of fs/Makefile the
binfmts are linked in such an order that for each exec of ELF file we hit
first the load routine of script_format, then misc_format, then
aout_format and then only elf_format's (as all others fail with ENOEXEC).
This is not good - ELF should be first as most binaries are ELF. I will
send a patch if no-one else will soon. (I try to understand ramdisk stuff
first and too busy for Makefielddling)
Regards,
