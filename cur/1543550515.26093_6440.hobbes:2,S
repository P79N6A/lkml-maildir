Hello!
I know this may not be the right place but I tried in a lot of
different places:
Following problem: I have a nvidia card, the nvidia drivers 0.9-5
an ALi MoBo (P5A-B).
I have test7 running wonderful.
When I start X under test8 - test9-pre7 it reboots immediately.
Nothing in the logfiles, like a hard reset.
I tried the following things:
* compiled the nvidia_kernel with all the options for turning of
  agp 2x/4x, SBA, FW
* installed the ALi patches for test7/test8 from #nvidia ice-dcc
but it was always the same.
I looked into the test8-patch but didn't find any changes to agp-support.
Does anybody have an idea what can be the source of these reboots?
Please Cc: me any answer since I am not subscribed to the list, thanks a lot!
Best wishes
Norbert
