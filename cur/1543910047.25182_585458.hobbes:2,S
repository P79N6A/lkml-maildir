There was some earlier in this thread as well.

Indeed.  If I could trust atomic_read()/atomic_set() to cause the compiler
to maintain ordering, then I could just use them instead of having to
create an  ORDERED_WRT_IRQ().  (Or ACCESS_ONCE(), as it is called in a
different patch.)

Suppose I tried replacing the ORDERED_WRT_IRQ() calls with
atomic_read() and atomic_set().  Starting with __rcu_read_lock():
o	If "ORDERED_WRT_IRQ(__get_cpu_var(rcu_flipctr)[idx])++"
	was ordered by the compiler after
	"ORDERED_WRT_IRQ(me->rcu_read_lock_nesting) = nesting + 1", then
	suppose an NMI/SMI happened after the rcu_read_lock_nesting but
	before the rcu_flipctr.
	Then if there was an rcu_read_lock() in the SMI/NMI
	handler (which is perfectly legal), the nested rcu_read_lock()
	would believe that it could take the then-clause of the
	enclosing "if" statement.  But because the rcu_flipctr per-CPU
	variable had not yet been incremented, an RCU updater would
	be within its rights to assume that there were no RCU reads
	in progress, thus possibly yanking a data structure out from
	under the reader in the SMI/NMI function.
	Fatal outcome.  Note that only one CPU is involved here
	because these are all either per-CPU or per-task variables.
o	If "ORDERED_WRT_IRQ(me->rcu_read_lock_nesting) = nesting + 1"
	was ordered by the compiler to follow the
	"ORDERED_WRT_IRQ(me->rcu_flipctr_idx) = idx", and an NMI/SMI
	happened between the two, then an __rcu_read_lock() in the NMI/SMI
	would incorrectly take the "else" clause of the enclosing "if"
	statement.  If some other CPU flipped the rcu_ctrlblk.completed
	in the meantime, then the __rcu_read_lock() would (correctly)
	write the new value into rcu_flipctr_idx.
	Well and good so far.  But the problem arises in
	__rcu_read_unlock(), which then decrements the wrong counter.
	Depending on exactly how subsequent events played out, this could
	result in either prematurely ending grace periods or never-ending
	grace periods, both of which are fatal outcomes.
And the following are not needed in the current version of the
patch, but will be in a future version that either avoids disabling
irqs or that dispenses with the smp_read_barrier_depends() that I
have 99% convinced myself is unneeded:
o	nesting = ORDERED_WRT_IRQ(me->rcu_read_lock_nesting);
o	idx = ORDERED_WRT_IRQ(rcu_ctrlblk.completed) & 0x1;
Furthermore, in that future version, irq handlers can cause the same
mischief that SMI/NMI handlers can in this version.
Next, looking at __rcu_read_unlock():
o	If "ORDERED_WRT_IRQ(me->rcu_read_lock_nesting) = nesting - 1"
	was reordered by the compiler to follow the
	"ORDERED_WRT_IRQ(__get_cpu_var(rcu_flipctr)[idx])--",
	then if an NMI/SMI containing an rcu_read_lock() occurs between
	the two, this nested rcu_read_lock() would incorrectly believe
	that it was protected by an enclosing RCU read-side critical
	section as described in the first reversal discussed for
	__rcu_read_lock() above.  Again, fatal outcome.
This is what we have now.  It is not hard to imagine situations that
interact with -both- interrupt handlers -and- other CPUs, as described
earlier.
							Thanx, Paul
