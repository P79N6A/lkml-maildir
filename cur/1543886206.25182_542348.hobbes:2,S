(Unless you're using the mq extension, which regularly truncates
files. But you're definitely the first person to run into this sort of
thing in any case.)

I think if the files are identical up to the truncation point, we can
rule out nlink concerns. If for some reason Mercurial's COW logic got
fooled, the result would be a bit of a jumble at the end. And you'd be
unlikely to hit any sort of race as a single user on a laptop.
Can you use hg debugindex to determine if the truncation point
corresponds with a whole delta or whether it's in the middle of a
delta? 
For noninterleaved revlogs like your manifest above, the .i file is an
index build of a collection of 64-byte entries. It's pretty hard to
imagine how you'd lose 8 bytes since all I/O is done in multiples of
64-bytes. Oh, I'm misreading that - they differ by 3008 bytes, which
is 47 * 64.
