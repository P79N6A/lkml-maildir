This is my preference too.  In general, block is the only one that
should care what the REQ_SOFTBARRIER flag actually means.  SCSI only
cares that it submits a non mergeable request.
I'm happy to separate the meaning of REQ_SPECIAL from req->special.

heh .. would this be because no other driver uses the block layer for
requeuing ... ?
