Are there perhaps two different front-end machines? And mirroring
problems?

Absolutely. The mirroring has been slow again lately. I've packed my 
archive, but I suspect others should much more aggressively now be using 
the "objects/info/alternates" information to point to my tree, so that 
they don't even need to have their objects at all (no packing 
even necessary - just running "git prune-packed" on peoples archives 
would get rid of any duplicate objects when I pack mine).
