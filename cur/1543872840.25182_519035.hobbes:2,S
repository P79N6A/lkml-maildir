FYI the problem is still being analysed behind the scenes. Chip's patch didn't fix 
it in all cases unfortunately -- it just changed the timing enough to make it happen
less often. The latest evidence points to a DMA mapping management problem
in Linux. Apparently in some cases sata_nv does DMA on an already freed and then
reused mapping.
