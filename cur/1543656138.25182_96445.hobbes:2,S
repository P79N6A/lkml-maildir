You're not alone with this problem. I suspect some fishy stuff in the
vt8235, because the driver programs it exactly the same as vt8233a, but
while the vt8233a doesn't seem to have problems with DVDs and CDs, the
vt8235 fails for many people.
It might be some new DVD drive, though.
Can you send me 'hdparm -i' of the drive?
I'll try to make a patch to circumvent the problem ...
Thanks.
