I can't see how it is "vital", or even makes a difference at all.
Other than upping the price a bit.  The pc doesn't need VGA compatibility
to boot - because you supply a video bios.  The mainboard bios
uses the video bios. (There have been pc's with ibm-incompatible
displays before)
Linux d(and other open os'es) doesn�'t need VGA at all, because 
you supply docs.  You probably won't even have to write the driver
yourself.
Windows doesn't need VGA - if you supply a windows driver.  That
shouldn�'t be hard to do.  
Now, what's left? :-)
