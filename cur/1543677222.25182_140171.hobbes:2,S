AFAICS, the way to do a perfectly safe "sole ownership" check is
to grab the per-dentry lock (instead of dcache_lock) and
do the check.

Yes and we need an audit. Besides I see places where d_count check
is being done without holding *any* lock. That is ok only if the
dentry is guranteed to be unhashed and we are doing a "sole ownership"
check. Otherwise it may not work.

There are some rules that we need to work out irrespective of
RCU and document clearly -
1. d_unhashed() checks that are being done with and without dcache_lock -
	if (!d_unhashed(new_dentry)) {
		d_drop(new_dentry);
		rehash = new_dentry;
	}
This seems to require that either we hold the dcache_lock or the operations
that we do on the dentry allow unhashed dentries.
2. Checking for "sole ownership" of dentries. Depending on whether the
   dentry is hashed and what operation we are going to do, we will
   need to hold the per-dentry lock.
I am glad that you are reviewing this. Is there any other dcache
operations in filesystems that you would like to add to the list
above ?
Thanks
