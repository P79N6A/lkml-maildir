For businesses in some parts of the country, this is also becoming more
common (though it is usually 10 Mbit/s.  I believe that this will become
more and more common.
I do not agree with Linus's concept that you are foolish to allow people
"untrusted direct access", in so far as it applies to "no one would/will
allow high speed connections their machines."  Linus, dial-up
connections may not be a thing of the past for years to come, but what
we call high-speed is indeed changing.  Let us not let Linux fall
behind.  (AirSwitch in Utah offers 10 Mbits/s to the home in at least
Utah County.)
As for the technical debate of how to do this load limiting or
performance enhancement... I say do what is best on technical grounds...
not on bad assumptions.  This may mean that the other set of patches
going around may be best, or it may mean Ingo's is best or maybe
something entirely different.  I personally do not know!
