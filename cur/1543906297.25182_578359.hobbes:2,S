hrm.  People reach for GFP_ATOMIC so often that it becomes a habit, I guess.
It makes one wonder how much that lovely fault-injection framework is being
used.

There would be a few.  mempool does a non-__GFP_WAIT allocation
deliberately, for example (I still think that's fishy btw).
But I don't expect there would be a large number of falsies.  We could add
a __GFP_I_REALLY_MEANT_ATOMIC flag to shut those up.

Could.  But GFP_ATOMIC at initcall-time really isn't a problem (except that
it can probably also happen at modprobe-time).
What is the major concern is needlessly atomic allocations at regular
runtime.
