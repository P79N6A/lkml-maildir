The default IRQ threads seem to be at RT priorities 25-49. So a user
should never have a RT compute bound task at a RT priority higher than
25? Doesn't seem quite right. In any case, I have other less compute
bound lower priority RT tasks also running on the same CPU so my high
priority RT task must be giving up the CPU somewhere along the line. Why
is it not able to receive signals? Something is not quite right here.
