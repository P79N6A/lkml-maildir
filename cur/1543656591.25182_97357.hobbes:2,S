If you really want single source you might use something like m4 to split
out both 2.4 and 2.5 versions which are less cluttered.
I admit this doesn't make your job a bit easier, but people reading the
drivers for one series or the other would have an easier job reading the
code. In a perfect world that would means they would find bugs for you and
just send patches. In reality you wouldn't have people telling you your
code was ugly.
