Yes, I know -- tp_smapi does that too. And it's still negligible,
usually a few microseconds.
Heck, the hdaps driver polls that same I2C bus 50 times per seconds
and still doesn't tickle the load average.

Exactly -- and they've been working merrily ever since.
And if you don't want to trust applet developers, cache the latest
reads and refresh them only if X jiffies have passed.

You're taking a polling-based hardware, exposing it as an event-based
interface, and then and kludging it so that it behaves like polling
again...
So, in this scheme, how many lines of code does is the equivalent of
"cat /sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/voltage"?

"Generic interface for accelerometers (AMS, HDAPS, ...)" on LKML, a
few weeks ago, about moving accelerator-based hard disk parking from
sysfs polling to the the input infrastructure. One unresolved issue
was how to find which input device happens to be the relevant
accelerometer.
