Hello all,
Building most recent linux-linus' tree with crypto api support.
After running the new kernel and trying to boot it I'm getting:
"Failed to setup dm-crypt key mapping.
Check kernel for support for the aes-cbc-essiv:sha256 cipher spec and
verify that /dev/hda4 contains at least 133 sectors.
Failed to read from key storage"
The problem here is that I have aes and sha built statically on the
kernel and it's working with 2.6.22-rc7. I'm actually using the same
config file as I used on 2.6.22-rc7.
Attached is my .config file. Below my gcc version and cryptsetup version:
$ gcc --version
gcc (GCC) 4.1.2 20060928 (prerelease) (Ubuntu 4.1.1-13ubuntu5)

$ cryptsetup --version
cryptsetup 1.0.5
Does anyone have a clue about what's happening here???
