Hi,
  I just downloaded 2.3.26-pre2 - and surprise, ncpfs does not compile.
It happens because of there is
   inode->i_blocks = (inode->i_size - 1) / inode->i_blksize + 1;
Should I introduce i_blksize_shift into private portion of inode and
maintain i_blksize only for other kernel parts (stat syscall) or what
is correct action?
  I can hardcode shift value into code because of block size on ncpfs
is always 512 bytes, but I just want to know...
                                           Thanks,
                                                Petr Vandrovec
