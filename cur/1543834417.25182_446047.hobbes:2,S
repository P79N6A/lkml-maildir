Subject: [PATCH] Add maintainer for memory management
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/7/24/1

I recently realized that there's no listing of a memory management
maintainer in the MAINTAINERS file. And didn't know about
linux-mm@kvack.org before Ingo enlightened me.  So I've decided to add
one.  Since Christoph is the first person to come in my mind as the
proper maintainer, (and I haven't asked him if he wants this title :)
I'll let him either add others to the list, or replace his name
altogether.
(I also used the email that he had in slab.c)
Note: If someone else is more likely the person than Christoph, don't be
offended that I didn't choose you.  It's just that Christoph has
responded the most whenever I mention anything about memory. So I chose
that as my criteria, than looking at who submits the most memory
patches.
