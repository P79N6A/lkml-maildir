The BUG() seems to have been inserted to ensure that
truncate_inode_pages() is called on the inode before it is
cleared. (This frees up the page cache)
The easiest way to ensure this is to make your 'put_inode()' method
call truncate_inode_pages() whenever the i_count falls to 1. See the
code in 'fs/inode.c:iput()'...
Cheers,
