Interesting... It looks a _lot_ like my device_ext :-)
The reason we don't use PCI sysdata is that currently, our PCI layer
already hijacks it with something else (ugh, I know, it sucks). I'm
pondering consolidating all of this though, but since I need that for
more than PCI, it cannot be just sysdata. Also, as I explained, I'd
prefer having it directly in struct device to avoid one more pointer
indirection in the DMA hot path.
But it looks like if we get that, x86 might be able to move their
sysdata to there.
You might be bad at naming, but I'm worse. Your dev_sysdata wins over my
device_ext imho :-)
So unless I get some better proposal, I'll do a patch introducing that
as an empty struct on all archs, possibly tonmorrow, and then start
migrating things to it.
Cheers,
Ben.
