You've got it all correct.

Yes, these calculations are correct.

This analysis is again entirely correct.

Yes, this is the theory behind using task weights to flatten the task
group hierarchies. My prior post assumed all this and described a method
to make nice numbers behave as expected in the global context atop it.
