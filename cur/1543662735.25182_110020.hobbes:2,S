Dominic,
 this broke ACPI. 
	In file included from drivers/acpi/processor.c:49:
	include/acpi/processor.h:78: field `freq_table' has incomplete type
AGAIN.
For about the 15th time. 
You guys need to talk more. A LOT more. Or y ou need to start checking who 
is actually _using_ the frequency code, and when you make changes to the 
interfaces you need to _update_ the users, instead of just causing kernel 
compiles to fail every frigging time you make a change.
