Not 1/N, but (1-overhead)/N, where the overhead is the CPU time being used to
switch between the processes. The more you switch, the more time you spend
executing _none_ of the N processes that are so eager to be executed.

You could complain that you now have to spend 4 times as much money on
gasoline for driving to the bank to cash your paycheck 4 times as often. And
if the lines at the bank are really long, you might wish your checks were
scheduled less often, just like a CPU-hungry process wishes for long,
infrequent timeslices.
