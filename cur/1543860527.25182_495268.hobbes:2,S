The text representation (in openpromfs) is *useless*, since it cannot
be transformed back into the binary representation.
Most tools have an easier time using the raw binary version too.
If a user wants to see text, they can use an "lsdevtree" program.

Such transformations don't belong in the kernel but in userland.

While I hate deep paths, /sys/firmware/device-tree does sound good.
