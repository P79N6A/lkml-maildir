Yes.  Today I haven't experienced the loop problem.  On the other hand,
when I reboot back and forth between 2.5.53 and 2.5.59, I have to
restart the server nfs programs or I get permission denied on the client
and "rpc.mountd: getfh failed: Operation not permitted" on the server.
I have also had to restart 2.4 clients because NFS silently hangs.  I
believe there's a few patches on the list that I need to apply regarding
this.
