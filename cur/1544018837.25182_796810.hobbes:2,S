Subject: [PATCH 11/12] x86: Remove extra barriers from load_gs_base()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2009/1/26/18

Impact: optimization
mb() generates an mfence instruction, which is not needed here.  Only
a compiler barrier is needed, and that is handled by the memory clobber
in the wrmsrl function.
