That function is very nice functionality but we could not implement it
properly outside of the kernel.  So the code has been disabled until
just recently. 
Hmm.  Looking at the patch it is most definitely being called from
process context.  Although I think the original was ok from interrupt
context as well.

Oops.  Although I am actually surprised kunmap_atomic even needs the address.
Although I can see the kmap type being equally redundant.
There is a much more serious bug there as well.  The code as it
exists is flatly impossible on x86_64 and some other architectures
as they do not support kmap.  It is also broken on x86 as grain can
easily be larger than page size, on old memory controllers where this
is most needed it is the frequently the size of a memory chip select
(aka the size of a single sided DIMM).
We need to do two things.
- Remove a factor from edac_mc_scrub_block (call it edac_mc_scrub_page)
  that simply scrubs a page or maybe a sub page.
- Place the edac_mc_scrub_page which does the kmap and a loop through
  the page contents in arch specific code.
