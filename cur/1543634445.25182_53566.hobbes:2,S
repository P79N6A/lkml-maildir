I've often thought that more "in kernel" test features should be available for 
those who'd like to do a bit of torture testing, but don't have all the 
patches to hand.
In addition to this, maybe tests to:
1. Fail kmalloc occasionally
2. Corrupt network data packets
3. Test USB hardware  (there was a kernel patch for isoc bandwidth tests, that 
allowed writing to a non-existent endpoint - bitrotted now)
and probably lots more.
I'd like to see all of these enabled seperately as CONFIG_ options. They also 
need to be protected by something like CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL, so people don't 
unwittingly enable them on production systems.
An example (not meant to be applied) of this is attached. You'd then just 
dep_(m)bool on CONFIG_TESTONLY for whatever CONFIG_KMALLOC_TESTMODE type 
thing you've added.
Thoughts?
Brad
