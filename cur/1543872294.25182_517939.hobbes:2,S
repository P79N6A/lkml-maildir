Thank you very much for taking the time to explain it to me and I apologise 
for the false positive. It's very much due to running qemu directing 
everything to the serial console which is just as you say. Allowing qemu to 
output to graphic fixes the error. Unfortunately that also makes akpm's oops 
go away so I can't really reproduce it now. Perhaps the bug occurs due to 
interrupts being disabled for an extended time; it gives me something to look 
at now.
Thanks!
