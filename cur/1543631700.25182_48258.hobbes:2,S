That's the whole point isn't it. If Linus had used a licensing model
(patent or copyright, I don't care) by which every Linux user would
have to pay him a royalty, we wouldn't be here today. The same stands
for real-time in Linux. As long as users have to pay one vendor every
time they use the technology, it will not lift off the ground and will
keep Linux stuck with it.

This is an oversimplification. You should add that Victor wants to
be the only one who can help others. And in doing so, he is not helping
anyone but himself.

I personnally think that FSMLabs will probably not live very long.
They base their entire business model on one very shallow patent.
The day the patent goes, so does FSMLabs.
It's not like this is IBM who has thousands of patents. This company
relies on a single shallow patent for its entire revenue stream.
Talk about playing Russian-roulette with a fully loaded gun.
