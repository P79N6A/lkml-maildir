You can already do this, just specify /dev/md0 as the device to install
onto, and lilo does the rest

I can confirm that this works on RedHat 6.2 + Lilo 0.21 + kernel
2.4.0-test8 and RAID1.
I have a mirrored boot drive in a pair of firewalls / routers and to test
before I put them into service I pulled hda and the machine booted fine
from hdc and baring winging about the missing disk (all the drives are
mirrored) carried on as normal. A fresh disk was put and rebuilt no
problems and was then booted off with the other disk missing.

An NT server can be run by an idiot, and usually is.
