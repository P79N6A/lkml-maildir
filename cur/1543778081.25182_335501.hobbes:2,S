Yes right, I was just not aware recent hardware (still) supports that. I
mean even mit 2MB modules most of them are specified only to 8GB. I would
consider buying such a system quite foolish. All of the HP servers with 12GB
and more seem to support EM64T. Do you know vendors who ship non-EM64T
servers with more than 16GB?
