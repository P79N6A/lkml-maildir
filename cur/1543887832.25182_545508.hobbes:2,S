The C3s all have cx8, but it needs to be enabled in an MSR first.
(See arch/i386/kernel/cpu/centaur.c , search for CX8)
Did we add code that uses cmpxchg8b before identify_cpu() gets run ?
I've not been paying attention to .22rc (busy trying to beat .21 into shape for F7)
so I may have missed something obvious. Andi?
