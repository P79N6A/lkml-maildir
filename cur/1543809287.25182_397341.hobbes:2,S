It does sound like the Kylix debugger depended very tightly on some very 
specific old implementation issue. I don't see quite what it could be (gdb 
didn't really care, for example), but yes, semantics _did_ change.
With the new semantics, the process doesn't see that it's being debugged 
any more because the TF flag change is now hidden from the signal stack. 
That indirectly also means that the debugger itself only sees TF change in 
the register state if the process itself set it (not if the TF bit was set 
implicitly by the debugger asking for a singlestep event).
The new semantics are really bug-fixes, and actually made it possible to 
debug things that weren't really possible to debug before. And you had to 
do some pretty strange things for them to matter to the debugger, but 
apparently Kylix does exactly that ;(

Hmm. You could try variations on the appended patch. Try changing the 
"#if 0" to "#if 1" in various combinations, to see which one Kylix seems 
to care about.
