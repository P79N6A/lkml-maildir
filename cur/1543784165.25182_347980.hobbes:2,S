Using ACPI or any other method to choose broadcast or use mask version
of IPI in flat mode for <=8 cpus has no real value. I had posted a 
small stat program that showed using mask IPI provides same performance numbers.
We didnt choose that method only because there is no perf gain except code 
bloat. I dont understand putting all that complexity without any real merrit.
Moreover CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU does not imply physical CPU hotplug, which i had
tried to convey several times. 
It is important to understand that there is no just ONE RIGHT way
and that we consider alternatives for the right reason.

Sorry Andi if you felt that way. I was trying to get some consistent feedback
and that you also consider and weight in what we explain instead of being
a one way street.
Certainly my intend was not to blame you, but to explain with clarity
so we dont end up reworking some trivial patches for a long time.
If you feel that way, i deeply apologize, and repeat, thats not my intend.
