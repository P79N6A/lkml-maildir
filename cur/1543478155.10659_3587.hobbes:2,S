Good. This sounds like a classic.

Ok, the thing I'd really like to hear is that when you see behaviour
like this, could you please do a "ps axl" while you have the bad
behaviour going on (ie when you have multiple processes in disk wait).
I'd like to see what the wchan is for the processes in question - are
they waiting on the page cache, on buffers, or on inodes.
Basically, I _suspect_ that what is going on is somebody waiting on a IO
entity just because the IO entity is locked - never mind the fact that
it is perfectly up-to-date, and it is only locked for IO because it is
busy getting written out. 
I've made the same mistake several times, and I suspect others have too,
and before I start looking into where it is I'd _really_ like to have it
narrowed down a bit.
I agree that we shouldn't see more processes in the D state just because
somebody else is writing out buffers or inodes somewhere.  But at the
same time I wouldn't be at all surprised if we had some silly locking
going on (the superblock, for example, could easily badly serialize
accesses unnecessarily - we saw another case where superblock locking
didn't just result in bad performance, but in actual deadlock
situations).
