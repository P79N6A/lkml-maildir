Well, if what's on the internal stack of the FPU can actually leak
information, I think the notion of "leak" has expanded just a bit
too much.
A rogue process could not even know what instruction was about to
be executed, nor what the previous instruction was, nor when since
boot it was executed, nor by whom. The 'data' associated with those
unknown instructions would make a good random number generator,
or a round-about method of obtaining PI (st0 almost always contains it).
That's about all.
Cheers,
