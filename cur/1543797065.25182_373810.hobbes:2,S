Problem is that there are certain monopolists who would like everybody to
think there is nothing else around... besides, "works with Linux" (or BSD,
or whatever) doesn't say anything if it is "includes a driver for Red Hat's
2.2.x-y". "Works with Windows" doesn't say anything either (even if MSFT
themselves certifies games for running on Win98 and later it doesn't mean
they will run on WinNT)

Doesn't work, as almost nothing is "Linux certified" today.

We here having any credible figures will happen /long/ after the affected
company has smelled the coffee and taken appropiate steps. They /do/ care
about who buys their stuff. It just is too little for now to make any big
difference. Having the figures here won't do any difference.

There is hardware that works well enough with Linux, thank you so much.
Some is broken, some doesn't work at all.

It would be very nice, true. But just isn't here yet.
