The pages are kept in a cache pool which is made of all the free memory.
E.g. the following command shows a system with 331M cache pool:
% free -m
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:           488        482          5          0          7        331
-/+ buffers/cache:        142        345
Swap:          127          0        127
That would be more than enough for the stock read-ahead to handle 100
concurrent readers.

Sure, it is the desired behavior. This patch provides exactly this feature :)
