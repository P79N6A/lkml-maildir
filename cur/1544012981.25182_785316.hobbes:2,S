Not really. That's the default setting I use for XFS debugging. I
just put breakpoints on "panic" and "stop" (sometimes
bust_spinlocks) and just let the kernel panic routine handle the
segv which will trip a breakpoint. Then just walk back up the stack
to the function that triggered the real SEGV and go from there.
This is pretty much necessary for XFS debugging because
just mounting a filesystem causes 8-10 SEGV signals to occur.
You simply can't run xfsqa when that is occurring...
Cheers,
Dave.
