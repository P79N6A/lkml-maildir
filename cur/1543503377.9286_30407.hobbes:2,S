Unfortunately, it's not the printer that's conflicting, but ide1, and
as far as I'm aware, that's not movable...
What gets me is that both the networking and the CD-writer on ide1
work fine, so I have to assume that the conflict is a virtual one, and
the network card isn't actually using 0x376 (offset 0x16 into the
card's space)...
Best wishes from Riley.
