:)  Well a vserver pretends to be a full system of its own, though you
can have lots of vservers on one machine.  Processes in each virtual
server see only other processes in the same vserver.  However in
vserver the pids they see are the real kernel pids - except for one
process per vserver which can be the fakeinit.  Other processes in the
same vserver see it as pid 1, but to the kernel it is still known by
its real pid.

In fact this is one way we considered implementing the virtual pids -
the pidspace id would be the upper some bits of the pid, and the vpid
would be the lower bits, so that the kernel pid would simply be
(pidspace_id << some_shift | vpid).
