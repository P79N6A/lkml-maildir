Might this, instead, be an opportunity to get rid of the internal
register_chrdev() and unregister_chrdev() calls in favor of the cdev
interface?  register_chrdev() is a bit of a backward-compatibility hack
at this point, and cdevs, in theory, are safer since they won't present
drivers with minor numbers they might not be prepared to handle.
