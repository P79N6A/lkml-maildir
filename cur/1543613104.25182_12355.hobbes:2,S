First read about the NMI boot option in Documentation/nmi_watchdog.txt. 
If you have this turned on and are not oopsing, then the timer (at
least) is interrupting.  The next step I would take would be to used
either kdb (no experience) or kgdb.  I have my own version of this if
you are interested.  It does, however, require an RS232 (serial)
connection to a host machine.
I don't know about kdb, but kgdb (my version) uses the NMI to trap the
other cpus and also traps NMIs on the way to oopsing.
