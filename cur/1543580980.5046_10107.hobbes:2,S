That's what I'd do, anyway - /dev/pieceofstring would return the length of
said piece of string in some units, explicityly stated. (e.g. "5m" or
"15ft").
"uname -s" ("how long's a piece of string on this system") would then
convert the length into feet, metres or fathoms, depending on what the
user prefers.
