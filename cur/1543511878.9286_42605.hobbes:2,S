oh come on horst.. you know perfectly well the kernel has to set some kind
of policy.. it's either major/minor's or names. no way round it. Try be

devfs is a solution to a different problem. i stated as much in the point
you're replying to!!! Is this a serious reply, or are you just  trying to
increase the anti-devfs post count...

Have you looked at devfs???? it is not complex! and from pov of a driver
it's nearly exactly the same as the old way of registering major/minors.. 
the choice is what?? loads of scripts to monitor /proc? I wan't to set
policy on my /dev. Pretty clear with a userland daemon and one config file -
a morass if done with scripts.

not a devfs issue. that's a much higher distribution issue.. ie disk group..
automounter.. the user mount option in fstab. devfs is just concerned with a
dynamic /dev - how you want to handle security is up to you, and you set
policy in a config file accordingly.

true. but the convention at the moment is /dev, and that's not likely to
change in the near future. devfs just tries to improve /dev, not cure world
hunger. So let's hammer out what's right and wrong with devfs and leave the
rest alone.
