Subject: file operations: release can race with read/write?

I have a question about the synchronization of file_operations: is it
intended that the .release method can be called while a .read or
.write method is still running?
The reason I ask is that I've seen a crash in practice that appears to
be caused by this race, and I'm wondering whether the correct fix is
to add synchronization to the driver's .release method (this is a
character device), or whether the core kernel is supposed to provide
this synchronization.
I've written a quick test case that seems to show this happen in
practice, and from the code in fs/open.c and fs/read_write.c it looks
possible as well: sys_read() and sys_write() just do fget_light(),
which will not increment the file's reference count on the fast path,
so a racing sys_close() from another thread could do the final fput()
that ends up calling the file's .release method before the read or
write has finished.
I think the actual file data structure is OK, because it is freed with
RCU, so it won't be freed too soon.  But a .release method may free
other driver-internal state that is still in use because of this.
It seems that we wouldn't want to give up the fget_light()
optimization in read/write, so probably the right place to handle this
is in the driver.  But on the other hand, this is kind of a subtle
booby trap that has been laid.  So I would appreciate guidance from
smarter people.
Thanks,
  Roland
BTW, here's the test case -- it seems pretty conclusive to me, but
maybe I'm all wet and misunderstanding things.  There's a kernel
module that just prints "Write raced with close?" if it sees the race,
and a userspace driver that just spawns two threads, one that does
open/close in a loop and one that does write in a loop.  Running this
on my machine, I see several race messages get printed.
