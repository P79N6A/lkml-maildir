P.P.S. (last one;)
To make it cease and desist starving your box, renice the shell you're 
running irman from.  12 is the magic (hmm) number here at which starvation 
ceases.
It's interesting to watch the response times irman reports.  The higher the 
renice level, the better response times it reports both in 2.5.64-virgin, 
and 2.5.64-combo (which looks like what is in bk2).  /me has no clue 
whether that means anything or not ;-)
