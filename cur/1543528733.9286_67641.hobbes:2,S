I have the same disk and get ~15-21 MB/sec with a BX chipset.  I also
noticed
the "maxDMA=0(slow)" however I doubt that it has a meaning (I think it even
vanished in newer hdparm versions, your hdparm seems a bit dated it doesn't
even now about UDMA modes).
I have come to the conclusion that the UDMA33 implementation of certain
chipsets
is quite bad.  Your results kind of confirm this observation.  I also have
seen results where a Promise Ultra 33 (not 66) card has improved HD
performance
over a BX chipset.
