Tried load/unload/load sequences with no luck. Tried increasing all the 
relevant delays within the ac97 and trident drivers, and while I think I've 
found a bug in a small part of the ac97 driver (trivial, will post soon, 
but isn't causing my problem), still no luck (even with load/unload/load 
again). Any suggestions on where I should try delays in the code?
If this is a weird ac97 implementation, any suggestions on how I'd go about 
figuring it out? Possible diagnosis utils and the like are always a boon, 
even if I have to run Windows on the thing and figure out how it's doing 
it. Since I have 2 of these machines, I can always run them in parallel and 
compare stuff between.
Many thanks.
