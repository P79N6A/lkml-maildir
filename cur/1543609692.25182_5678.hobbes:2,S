I have an interesting issue with the ide-tape driver. It manages 
to truncate anything read from tape[0]. From a very limited data 
set, it appears that the longer the data on the tape, the more 
blocks are truncated.
I've tried 2.4.6 and 2.4.14. Tape drive is a Seagate STT20000A, 
MB is a KT7-RAID w/ 768MB mem and an Athlon 1200. Drive is slave 
on the second channel (on the VIA controller, not the highpoint 
one). Other device is a BCD E520C CD-ROM. The tape is a 10G TR-5 
from Imation.
This setup does work with SCSI emulation, though the console 
gets spammed with messages like:
	st0: Error with sense data: Current st09:00: sense key Illegal Request
	Additional sense indicates Invalid command operation code
Amanda works with the SCSI setup; with the IDE setup, amlabel 
fails. I've tried re-tensioning the tape; no help.
I'm willing to try patches, incantations, etc.
[0] I assume it is truncating on the read side, but it could 
very well be doing it on the write side.
