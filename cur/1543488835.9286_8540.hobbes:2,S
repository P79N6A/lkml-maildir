 I am having quite a problem with glibc-2.1. I am wondering if anyone has
encountered the following. I am running RedHat 5.2 with 2.2.1-ac6 kernel and I
upgraded my glibc-2.1. Upgrade went smooth without any errors.But now, when I want
to run menuconfig on linux-2.2.2 with ac-7, it is giving me a message:
        "There seems to be a problem with the lxdialog companion utility which is
built prior Menuconfig. Usually this is an indication that you have upgraded/
downgraded your ncurses libraries and didn't remove the old ncurses. . . "
But I did remove it from /usr/include as well as any links pointing to ncurses.h
and recompiled ncurses again!  But it is still complaining about it. I also ran
"make distclean" on /usr/src/linux  directory as well as "make mrproper." But
alas, I am still getting it. I wanted to recompile my egcs-1.1.1 but it is failing
at the very end complainig that gcc is not working. But it does work, and I tested
it (with generic "hello world" program :).  I am out of ideas and if anyone who
could help me out I would be V-E-R-Y appreciative.   Thanks again.    Alex
