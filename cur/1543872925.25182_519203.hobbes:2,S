Someone else suggested the single -f, and I tried that, but even with the 
shell history set for 100,000 lines, i can't get back to the start, and I 
think its mucking with the shell arguments numbering as what I can see is 
about 5 reads through /etc/services accompanied by endless complaints 
of -EBADFD, the the logfile it generates says the port it was given was 
rejected when amcheck was run, here is that snip:
running /usr/local/sbin//amcheck Daily
Amanda Tape Server Host Check
-----------------------------
Holding disk /dumps: 72597 MB disk space available, using 72097 MB
slot 5: read label `Dailys-5', date `20070223002502'
NOTE: skipping tape-writable test
Tape Dailys-5 label ok
Server check took 4.556 seconds
Amanda Backup Client Hosts Check
--------------------------------
WARNING: coyote: selfcheck request failed: unable to bind to a reserved 
port (got port 32789)
Client check: 1 host checked in 34.733 seconds, 1 problem found
(brought to you by Amanda 2.5.1p3-20070222)
------------------eofsnip------------
The script quit by request shortly after as I didn't want it to further 
dirty the amanda database system.
