ZONE_DMA has a system specific meaning.  On a PCI system ISA could always
be exist through a PCI-to-ISA bridge, so you can't just go and give it
a system specific meaning.  It's also needed for PCI devices with a
less than 32-bit DMA limit; those exist in a rich variety.

Well, if you put packets on an aligned address you'll later take a bunch
of missalignment exceptions which are going to severly impact networking
performance ...

Change the configuration of the board to put the MV memory at the bottom.
Leave ZONE_DMA what it used to be, < 16MB.  Set the ZONE_NORMAL limit to
128MB.  Anything above that is non-dmable will go into ZONE_HIGHMEM.
See also CONFIG_LIMITED_DMA in 2.6.  It works, it has little compatibility
problems but it's a solution for platform that simply doesn't reflect the
Linux hw architecture very much ...
