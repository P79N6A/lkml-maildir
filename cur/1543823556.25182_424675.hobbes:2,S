Did this device work with previous versions of kernel?
libata used to give up on the first failure during probe, so the boot 
time would have been shorter in failure cases.  I think controlled 
retries during boot probe is a good thing, but the timeout of 30s for 
IDENTIFY commands can be shortened, I guess.
