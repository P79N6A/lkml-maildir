Even if we were to go for this tickless design, the fundamental question
remains: who wakes up the (sleeping) idle CPU upon a imbalance? Does some other
(busy) CPU wake it up (which makes the implementation complex) or the idle CPU 
checks imbalance itself at periodic intervals (which restricts the amount of
time a idle CPU may sleep).

I guess George's experience in implementing tickless systems is that
it is more of an overhead for a general purpose OS like Linux. George?
