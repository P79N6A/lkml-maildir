Funny how, having never used LVM you have an opinion about it.
I have. I have done EXACTLY what I described.
First of all, do you REALLY think my way is any less failure prone, 
especially in the presence of the possiblilty of power failure than any 
other method? My method preserves a mountable, valid file system at each 
step of the way - the resized downward of the old file system, the 
resize upward of the new, the file copy.
Secondly, if you are REALLY concerned about the manual aspect of what I 
suggested, you can write a simple shell script to do the work.
Third of all, the longest parts of the process I describe will be the 
resize downward of the old file system and the copy of the data - the 
LVM parts of this operation are pretty damn quick.
