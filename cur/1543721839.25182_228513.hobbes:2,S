It looks like SuSE as the first distribution took the sane approach to
seperate source and output files.
I presume they have documented this somewhere - and I have a patch
from Andreas G. that should actually solve this if a module is
compiled in the usual way like you do.
So you seems to be bitten by a distributor starting to use a new
facility in kbuild.
Why did you not post the error in your first mail btw?
