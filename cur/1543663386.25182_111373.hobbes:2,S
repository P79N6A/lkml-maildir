He is talking about directly calling the function behind the syscall,
not actually executing a syscall itself.
The kernel already does this in various places.  sys_read, sys_write,
open_filp, sys_close, and other functions are safe to call from kernel
code -- though this is discouraged.  init/do_mounts.c is a particularly
annoying case, and is a big reason why klibc needs to be merged.
syscalls should be made from userspace, not the kernel.
