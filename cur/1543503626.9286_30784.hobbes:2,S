There are several arguments for having multiple partitions.  I think most
of them have become irrelivant as disks have gotten faster and cheaper.
The one that still makes sense is to have /home on its own partition.
This allows you to do something like install Caldera and Red Hat on 1
machine, and share /home between them.  On my machine I make /usr/local
its own partition and I symlink /home -> usr/local/home.  I like this
arangement because I can reformat and reinstall a distribution and not
have to worry about my personal files.
Another thing I just remembered is that some BIOSes will not boot a kernel
if its more than 1G from the beginning of the disk.  If you have a machine
like this you need to have a partition on the drive suitable for booting.
Picking the size of the partitions is educated guesswork.  Because I grew
up in the days when everyone had a seperate /usr partition, I usually
do it like this:
/dev/hda1 -> 64M      /  (I keep kernel images here for BIOS)
/dev/hda2 -> 64M      swap
/dev/hda3 -> 512M     /usr
/dev/hda4 ->          /usr/local (with /home symlinked here)
But there are certainly a lot of other common ways to do it.
