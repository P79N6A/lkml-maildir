Subject: [PATCH] lguest: two net bugfixes
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/5/8/172

1) Bridging via host is broken: we need to set "promisc" bit in MAC
   address published by the host so the guest sends us everything.
   Thanks James Morris for the report (I don't use bridging).
2) Lguest network device uses 0 to mean "noone at this slot".  It used to
   use 0xFF, and one spot was missed.  Minor: it just means we'll have a
   useless extra transmit for broadcast packets.
