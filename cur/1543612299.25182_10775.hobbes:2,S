FYI - I have been having a heck of a time getting our MQ scheduler to
work well in 2.4.16/2.5.0.  The problem was mainly with performance
when running (I'm afraid to say) VolanoMark.  Turns out that the above
change makes a big difference in this benchmark when running with the
MQ scheduler.  There is an almost 50% drop in performance on my 8 way.
I suspect that one would not see such a dramatic drop (if any) with
the current scheduler as its performance is mostly limited by lock
contention in this benchmark.
Now, I'm aware that very few people are actively using our MQ scheduler,
and even fewer care about VolanoMark performance (perhaps no one on this
list).  However, this seemed like an interesting observation.
