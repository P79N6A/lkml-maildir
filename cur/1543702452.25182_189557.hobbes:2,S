If we have a hotplug media change event we can do:
   if new device x appears:
      x->device_nodes = all possible partition nodes
      start_media_change_timer()
   if media change on x:
      x->device_nodes = current media partitions
      clear_media_change_timer()
      create_nodes(x)
   if timeout: /* we didn't get media change so create all nodes */
      create_nodes(x)
Then the dumb devices (which should be a small minority) just show up
with a harmless excess of partitions.
