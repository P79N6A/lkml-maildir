Can't tell about chipset specific management, but as far as ACPI is
concerned, this Sony specific stuff is a nice way of hiding features
behind an undocumented device. Eg: the sound card _PS3 is empty and only
available through that AZPW method.[1] So I guess that the
platform_pci_set_power_state for ACPI D3 is basically a no-op there.

Yep, will try to get some measurement (by means of the acpi battery
status, no better way currently available here) but given the above I
suspect there's some benefit.

Yes, of course.
[1]: if you want to make a an idea, one such DSDT is available
here: 
http://oioio.altervista.org/linux/DSDT.sz72b.dsl
sony-laptop basically exposes the Device(SNC) and AZPW/GAZP for the
audio (an hda) and LNPW/GLNP for the nic (a sky2). Now see the
audio device Device(HDEF) and its _PS0 and _PS3.
PS: did I disappear from the Cc list? ;)
