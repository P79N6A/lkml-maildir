I agree it's the same effect, but I disagree about the cause. It's the
fault of the scsi mid-layer; it marks the device as dead when a command
times out and won't allow further accesses to it. The fact that it
happens to both of us with different drives and different scsi drivers
(you don't even have scsi, but ide-scsi emulation) shows that the scsi
midlayer is broken in both cases.
And as Justin Gibbs suggested, I'd bet that raising the timeout on the
failing scsi command in cdrdao would probably fix this for both of us,
but I haven't had time to try it. If so, it's not a userspace bug
because it allows any user with cdrom access to disable a cdrom until
reboot.
