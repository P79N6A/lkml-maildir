The lack of MMCONFIG support is indeed because some hypertransport
chipsets lack that support. But there are some BIOSes out there that are
advertising support for all busses in their MCFG acpi attribute (even
the busses managed by some amd8131 in a mixed nvidia-ck804/amd8131
motherboard), and the BIOS seems at least faulty for advertising a
capability that does not exist.
