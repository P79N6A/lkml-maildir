The second message in this thread, according to my reader, from Zan

True, but your messages are reading as advocacy for removing the 8k
option. I'm saying that's a bad idea. If I misunderstood your
position, then my bad.

If they even realize that it's the cause of the problem. In the
meantime, we're generating more bug reports to lkml. As the general
opinion is that the ones getting received now aren't getting enough
attention (see regression tracking threads), setting a default that is
known to break setups in hard to debug ways seems counterproductive.
