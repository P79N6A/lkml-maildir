There is always a chance of something not working, or a regression
getting introduced in any of the code .. -rt is all still a development
tree too, so it may not always be stable.

I wouldn't think so, but then what if Adeos/Xenomai has a new bug?

Ok ..

It's not a stretch to imagine. These real time chance has already been
included in commercial distros, and are generally getting made into
various products right now .. Just like what your doing .

I don't really know the details of this , but I would imagine there is
some sort of upgrade path for say routers .. I've heard people talk
about cell phone upgrading their software over the air.. It would be a
difficult proposition to say make some specific kernel static forever ..
Even the mainline stable kernel has bugs that get fixed..
