Now see I've been working on Unix systems since 1988 or so and in that
time I've learned to read the documentation properly (you haven't) and
I've also don't security work on a pile of systems. Your assumptions and
your whole mental model of this are horribly broken.

FreeBSD isn't a Unix system, and isn't compliant to the spec. Its
also still trivial to get out of a freebsd chroot using things like
ptrace. FreeBSD jails on the other hand do what you confusedly seem to
think should happen with chroot. They are seperate precisely because they
are different.
