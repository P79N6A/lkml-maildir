That is, of course, true, although "some notion of" is very broad, and 
one could also use this for detection and some hypervisor-specific 
communication for the actual I/O.
However, one probably wants to think about what the heck one actually 
means with "virtualization" in the absence of a lot of this stuff.  PCI 
is probably the closest thing we have to a lowest common denominator for 
device detection.
