I would add a field to struct semaphore that tracks the current process.
In your various up and downs have that field tracks the "current" process. 
Do you know what semaphore it is?
This way you dump the semaphore you can see what task it is holding
it.  Have the module dump the semaphore and you can id the task

Have you tried sysrq t?  See the Documentation/sysrq.txt file.
How stuck is the system?
