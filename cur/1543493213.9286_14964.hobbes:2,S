Yep! This plugs a major hole. It now makes the system usable. However
there is still a 5:1 difference in the page-count I can initially get
and eventually be left with (instead of 50:1). So there is still a
problem with getting those free pages back onto the free list.
I have everything set up to test anything else you want to try.
