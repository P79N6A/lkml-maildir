Thanks a lot for your responses. I did some more testing and have one more 
question.
In the "nonshared IRQ" PCI slot 0.9.0 the card works with the Quancom driver 
under Win2k but is ignored by linux 2.4.22 - as I wrote before.
In "shared IRQ" PCI slot 0.c.0 the card is recognized by linux - lspci:
00:0c.0 Class ff00: Quancom Electronic GmbH: Unknown device 3302 (rev 11)
The driver I use is open source ( see: 
http://linux-gpib.sourceforge.net/
 ). 
The maintainer helped me a lot to get this Ines-GPIB clone card running.
Is there a board / vendor who has good BIOS and PCI implementations? 
If I understand correctly - there is no simple way to tell a good PCI card 
apart from a bad one ? If I would send back the card they would want to know 
what exactly the problem ist - but when nobody knows that ???
Greetings
Michael
