thanks, I'll do that.

sure. we haven't used this to allocate dma memory in a long time. I was
just using it as an example in showing how difficult it was to allocate
32-bit memory. vmalloc essentially ends up being a
__get_free_page(GFP_*)
call.

also note that even if pci express hw was fixed, the machines still have
pci slots, which any old pci card can be plugged into.

that was a very understandable decision. and I do agree that using the
AMD IOMMU is a very nice architecture. it is unfortunate to have to deal
with this on EM64T. Will AMD's pci-express chipsets still maintain an
IOMMU, even if it's not needed for AGP anymore? (probably not public
information, I'll check via my channels).

agreed. I completely understand that there is no desire to modify the
core kernel to help our driver. that's one of the reasons I looked
through the other drivers, as I suspect that this is a problem for 
many drivers.  I only looked through the code for each briefly, but 
didn't see anything to handle this. I suspect it's more of a case that 
the drivers have not been stress tested on an x86_64 machine w/ 4+ G 
of memory.
also interesting to hear about some of the pci devices with limited
addressing capability. 
> I see two somewhat realistic ways to handle this:
either of those approaches sounds good. keeping compatibility with older
devices/drivers is certainly a good thing.
can the core kernel handle multiple new zones? I haven't looked at the
code, but the zones seem to always be ZONE_DMA and ZONE_NORMAL, with
some architectures adding ZONE_HIMEM at the end. if you add a 
ZONE_DMA_32 (or whatever) between ZONE_DMA and ZONE_NORMAL, will the 
core vm code be able to handle that? I guess one could argue if it 
can't yet, it should be able to, then each architecture could create 
as many zones as they wanted.
another brainstorm: instead of counting on just a large-grained zone and
call to __get_free_pages() returning an allocation within a given
bit-range, perhaps there could be large-grained zones, with a
fine-grained hint used to look for a subset within the zone. for example, 
there could be a DMA32 zone, but a mask w/ 24- or 29- bits enabled could 
be used to scan the DMA32 zone for a valid address. (don't know how well 
that fits into the current architecture).
Thanks,
Terence
