It WOULD BE. Think about clusters. With 32bit pids you can use 8bit to identify
node and 24bit to identify task on that node. To do this you'll need
max_pid==16777215 (or max_pid==8388607 ? whatever... plus few reserved pids
can be handy sometimes). IMHO max_pid is exactly right here.

See above.

Default should be 31bit IMO but sometimes you need something other.
Since max_pid access is not very time critical adjustable max value will
be good.
