Hm... A simple grep over the code showed that note_interrupt
is called w/o desc->lock in all places but __do_IRQ(). And this
looks like an error at least for the following reason:
note_interrupt() calls __report_bad_irq() and __report_bad_irq()
does require desc->lock to be held. So I suppose that we have
to do spin_lock(&desc->lock) before calling note_interrupt().
I'll prepare a patch in a moment.
