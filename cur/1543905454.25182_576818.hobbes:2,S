I'd like to see an edited form of this, together with an introduction to
LRO, written up in the Documentation subdirectory.  
As someone with some driver experience, but not on te bleeding edge,
some basc newbie questions pop into mind:
-- what is LRO?
-- Basic principles of operation?
-- Can I use it in my driver?  
-- Does my hardware have to have some special feature before I can use it?
-- What sort of performance improvement does it provide? Throughput?
   Latency? CPU usage? How does it affect DMA allocation? Does it 
   improve only a certain type of traffic (large/small packets, etc.)
-- Example code? What's the API? How should my driver use it?
Right now, I can maybe find answers by doing lots of googling.  I'd like
to have some quick way of getting a grip on this.
