I understand the arguments for compression, but I hate it for one
simple reason: recovery is more difficult when you corrupt some
file in your repository.
It's happened to me more than once and I did lose data.
Without compression, I might be able to recover if something
causes a block of zeros to be written to the middle of some
repository file.  With compression, you pretty much just lose.
