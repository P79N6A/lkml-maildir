No offense, but I really don't see why this matters at all ... the stuff
in -mm is what's under consideration for merging - what's in SuSE is
wholly irrelevant ? One obvious thing is that that codebase will be
much older ... would be useful if people can direct critiques at the
current codebase ;-)
