IIRC, that idiocy had been disabled by default (note that it's inherently
broken, since truncate() between your mmap() and memcpy() will lead to
a coredump, which is not something fwrite() is allowed to do in such
situation).
strace should show if there such mmap calls are made, anyway.  Did they
show up in the traces?
