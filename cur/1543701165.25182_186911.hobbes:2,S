I bet this is just yet another instance of a problem we've been
discussing on lkml and linux-mm for several months now (although Linus
asking for DMA presumably means it's not as well known as I thought
it was).
Basically, when you need to resort to paging for getting work done on
2.6 you're screwed. Your bk export takes a lot more memory than you
have RAM in your machine, right?
