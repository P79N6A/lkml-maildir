Hi greg,
I encountered a regression in linux-2.6.git which prevented the system from shutting down. I found that it 
was 'waiting_for_completion' on kobj_unregister.The same thing happened when I tried to take CPUs offline.
git-bisect pointed me to this commit :

    Kobject: convert drivers/* from kobject_unregister() to kobject_put()
In the file drivers/cpufreq/cpufreq.c, you have not replaced one occurrence of kobject_unregister with kobject_put. 
Apparently its because of the kobject_put in the subsequent line.

Now, this can be fixed by adding another kobject_put. But having two kobject_puts in consequent lines tells us that there 
should be two references to the kobject at that point. So, I believe that it is safe to remove the kobject_get 
corresponding to the existing kobject_put to fix this.
