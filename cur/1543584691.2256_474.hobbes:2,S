Even if not you can hash by page number not low bits so the hash is way 
smaller. You (in most cases) can also write the entry number in the relevant
tables onto the end of the object in spare space (or in front of it)
Something as trivial as
	struct usb_thingy
	{
		u32 thing_id;
		u32 flags;
		struct usb_thingy *next;
#ifndef __LP64__
		u32 pad
#endif
		struct usb_controller_goo goo;
	}
