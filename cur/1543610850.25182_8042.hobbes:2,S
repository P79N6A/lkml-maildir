Do you mean you don't like using a bitmask ?
00000001 = first CPU, its not logical, its physical.
Plus, how do you intend to set multiple non-contiguous CPUs?  A fraction
of them?  With only a 32-bit value?
Note also that my patch understands the underlying CPU nature, such that
"echo 0000ffff > /proc/123/affinity" will only affine task 123 to your
first 2 CPUs if you only have two.  Thus, "cat /proc/123/affinity" will
return "00000003".
