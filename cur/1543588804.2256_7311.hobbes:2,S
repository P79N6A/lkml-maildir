I'm not sure Eric would have to.
It's entirley possible the problem will solve itself 
when/if people like myself who hang around the edge of 
kernel dev , find their favourite piece of kernel has
no maintainer - and volunteer. 
So Eric solution may get new maintainers to appear for orphaned code
as 'if by magic'
Alternatively not, of course.

     demon-summoning in the garage, which you can just hose down afterwards.
