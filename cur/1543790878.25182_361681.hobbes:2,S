I don't suppose I could make puppy eyes at somebody _else_ to bang on git a 
bit and try to come up with a proof-of-concept patch?  (Say 
2.6.14-rc5-bisect.patch?)
I just downloaded the git source snapshot to find out it won't compile without 
openssl headers.  (Thanks, ubuntu, for stripping out every darn development 
header and making them separate things you have to hunt down and install 
individually, even though the box actually _has_ whatever darn library it's 
complaining about and really couldn't _function_ without it.  Sigh.)
