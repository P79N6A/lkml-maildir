Yep. In the cpu hotplug case, per-cpu data possibly isn't initialized
even the system state is 'running'. As the comments say in the original
code, some console drivers assume per-cpu resources have been allocated.
radeon fb is one such driver, which uses kmalloc. After a CPU is down,
the per-cpu data of slab is freed, so the system crashed when printing
some info.
Thanks,
