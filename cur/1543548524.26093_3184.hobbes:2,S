   Broken ?? Please explain.
This is old news.  Hans Dobbertin, in about 10 hours of CPU time on a
Pentium system, can generate hash collions in MD5.  This is not
something which you're supposed to be able to do with crypto checksums,
so effectively MD5 is "broken", and shouldn't be used in new
applications where a crypto checksum is required.  His break is probably
not exploitable for existing uses of MD5, so some people might claim
that MD5 hasn't been "broken" yet, but merely severly bent.  At some
level this is just a matter of semantics.
Regardless, the use of MD5 for new protocols/applications is not
recommend.
