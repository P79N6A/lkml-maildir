It was not clear. You just sent it a signal and expected it to go
away. No tasks, even user-mode tasks, just go away! They need to
execute the exit code in the context of the task that will
expected to eventually disappear. It's contents of "current"
that tells the exit code what to clean up.
This means that you could probably install a driver that patches
some code that the kernel thread executes. Nothing like
modifying code at run-time....

It depends how the signal was masked and how the thread was written.
Notice in the example posted, the code was reset to TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE
each time the loop was executed. If this is not done, the task won't
get interrupted by a signal again.
