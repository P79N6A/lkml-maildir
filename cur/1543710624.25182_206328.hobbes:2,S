i have now found a way to "fix" the problem, but it surely isnt the way
it should be.
if you first start xfree without amd64-agp module loaded, so X starts
without agp, and then stop xfree, and modprobe amd64-agp and start
xfree, it works... very strange, this is probably a fault by nvidia,
becaues their drivers doesent initialize agp proper, but there is a
chance that its a kernel bug too, i dont know, if you know, please let
me know
