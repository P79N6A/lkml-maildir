I'm assuming you mean they should continue to work like they
do today:  return the resource.  Your pseudocode below shows
an iomap utility taking a resource.

Sure, for PCI ... where the meaning of BARs is a fixed part of the
hardware spec, and it's not uncommon to skip a few.
But as I noted, that notion doesn't apply cleanly outside PCI;
indexes aren't necessarily portable between systems.  So any
such interface should discourage their use.
One issue with a dev_iomap() is that only memory resources
really need mapping ... but *all* of them need claiming.
(Modulo the detail that the iomap morphs i/o addresses too.)
The $SUBJECT function is a (minor) simplification for both
the mapping and claiming steps.
I think I'd rather see a dev_resource_claim() which combines
the request_{,mem_}region() semantics with mapping ... that
way drivers could save code, not just unify the two types
of register addressing.
