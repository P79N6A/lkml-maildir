The main this is that since this is a fixed-format, ABI-defined 
structure, regardless of individual fields it should be exported as a 
binary object.  That is also the only way to deal with a kernel which 
may not itself know about specific items making the data available to 
other users, like kexec.
It's not clear to me from reading the code what model you're using for 
exporting this data in sysfs.  Could you describe it in some detail?
What I had envisioned would be an object for the boot_params structure 
and a systematic object for each linked-list object, at a very minimum.
