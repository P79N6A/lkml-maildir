All this output is from the debugging code I have in the error handler in sata_nv for ADMA mode.

Hmm, it looks like the controller thinks the command has been sent to the drive and has "released" the command for the drive to do its thing, and hasn't received a response back yet. (At least that's what I believe bit 1 in the response flags means..) This might not be the fault of the controller or driver, it might just be the drive not responding. Can you post some drive information (like full dmesg from bootup)?
