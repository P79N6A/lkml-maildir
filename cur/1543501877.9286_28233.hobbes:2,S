Hello,
Last night, we have seen an unusual CPU load on our SMP server. At that
time, 3 povray were running (inducing a load of 3, which is normal). This
morning,
one povray was still running, but both CPUs were running a 100% (according to
top)
and the load was still 3. The machine was really unresponsive. uptime was 5
days.
We had to kill the povray process and the load droped down to a normal 0.1.
In the log files, we had a lot of these messages all over the night, if it helps
