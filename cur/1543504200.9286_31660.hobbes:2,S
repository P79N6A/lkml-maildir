More than a little in my book.
A correct solution in my view is to attempt to dynamicly allocate
the siginfo structures from signal_queue_cachep.  If we fail, then
we just send the signal without the info.  No terrible loss there.

No good -- sigqueueinfo(2) should be able to pass the whole thing
through from process to process.

Yep.

Nope.
