No. The changes are waiting in my local repository, ready to be applied.
I didn't want to apply them because we were supposed to release
lm_sensors 2.8.5 (for Linux 2.6.3 users) and the sysfs names change
wouldn't belong there.
The libsensors patches are available on my personal server here:
http://jdelvare.net1.nerim.net/sensors/
Apply both patches in order and you'll get a 2.6.3-mm4-compliant
library.
I will apply the libsensors changes to the CVS repository as soon as the
kernel modules changes are accepted into Linus' tree. If we did not
release a new version since there, I'll take a CVS snapshot right
before so that Linux 2.6.3 users have a usable version available (but
my preference strongly goes to releasing 2.8.5 instead).
Thanks for testing.
