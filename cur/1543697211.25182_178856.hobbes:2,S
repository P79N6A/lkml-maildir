I'm likely to get a slap for this one, but....

Since you've already done all the work for bk2cvs, why not add the 
functionality to bkd which would allow a simple client to do
	lobobk cvsclone
and
	lobobk cvspull
Ie be able to clone and update a local cvs repo from bkd? This would have the 
added advantage that users (kernel testers) could get any tagged versions 
from their local repo using cvs, rather than requiring diff trasmission from 
bkd to convert to another version. The client would be very simple too.
Obviously the local cvs repo would be read-only, and only useful for people to 
fetch sources. Bitkeeper would be required for development work. It would 
make the perfect mirroring tool aswell.
And when you've finished that, I'd like a moon rocket please. GPL, of 
course ;)
