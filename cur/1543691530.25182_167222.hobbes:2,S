I just noticed that our 8-way X440 is showing (in /proc/interrupts)
about 100 NMIs / second, on each CPU. Would some kind soul please tell
me if this is OK? A brief explanation of what this interrupt is being
used for would be appreciated.
We're running the latest RH Advanced server kernel.

Sorry if this is a stupid question.
Thanks,
John
