i'll certainly agree about the help text being more helpful, but that
doesn't completely obviate the need for making the options more clear.
and in particular, regarding the example i gave for my linksys --
it's hard to justify one option which implies that another option
*must* be selected in conjunction with it, but forcing the user to
do that manually, anyway.

p.s.  i'm starting to feel a little awkward here, being a kernel
newbie and never having contributed any real code or patches, 
amongst this many people who hack kernel internals in their
sleep.
but having built a kernel or two (or a couple hundred, actually),
i'm really obsessed with a friendly user interface and intuitive
layout of the config process.
if there is somewhere else i should take this, by all means, 
i don't want to take up any more time on this topic than i already
have, since i'm sure it's boring lots of people to tears.
