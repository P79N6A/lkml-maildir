Well, there's layout and then there's the tool(s).
Besides this select business, Bill (or someone :) mentioned a feature
that I requested about 8 months ago:  the ability to disable or enable
groups of drivers at one swoop.  And Matt has made some good
scripting suggestions.
For layout, we may not all agree on that part either.  :)
It's quite subjective.  E.g., I made/submitted a patch maybe 1 year
ago that tried to put all video graphics (frame buffer, AGP, DRM/DRI,
etc.) into one localized place in the menu structure.
OK, perhaps I wasn't persistent enough, but no one was interested
in it.  (That probably just means that config menus are low priority.)
