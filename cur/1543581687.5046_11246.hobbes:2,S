Cool. Thanks. I recompiled the module and am trying it now. So far the
ethernet connection is fine but the above problem isn't reproducable with 
100% accuracy and so it'll take me a wee while before I decide 'oooo....
aaaaa... that rocks my boat. it's fixed.'. :)
As such I'll try to give you a holler either in a few weeks time (if nothing
happens) or as soon as it breaks again.
