FWIW we (at Axis) run both uClibc and glibc for embedded Linux products,
and both work fine but obviously with different target compromises wrgds
to memory footprints, speed of porting etc. uClibc works fine with a
majority of programs relevant to us, not just a small list of useful
tools.
We have an arch/cris port of uClibc, which could be merged with the
official branch at some point.

uClibc seem to work fine shared, that's how I've ran it for a while now.
When doing a "complete" linux system in 2 MB flash to put in a product,
every shared byte possible is worth to put some time on :) Granted, if the
goal is just to compile 10 small tools it might not be very useful but
since it's not that difficult to support it, and you're making yet another
libc, why not keep it flexible.

I'm sorry I must have missed why yet another libc was needed in the first
place :)
