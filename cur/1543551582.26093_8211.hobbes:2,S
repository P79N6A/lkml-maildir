IV's should never be repeated (per key).  If you are using CBC mode,
they should not be just a counter, either (for different reasons).
A simple implementation technique is simply to use the encryption of
a block number / sector number / counter as your IV.  This ensures that
IV's don't repeat and that they all look cryptographically random.
