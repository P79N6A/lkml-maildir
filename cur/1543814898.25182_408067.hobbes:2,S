To the point.  I, insightful betimes, but a non-user of the technology,
can grep TFM's and find out what the names could mean, but we're left
guessing at what some of these *do*.  Translating names falls into the
"any idiot can" category of data mining, but if you code for them, we can
see context.  If you named them more transparently, we might even use
them right.  Maybe just comment well?
RDMA
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(rdma_wq); Work Queue (do what to it?)
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(rdma_translate_ip); Translate IP Address
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(rdma_resolve_ip); Resolve IP Address
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(rdma_addr_cancel); Address Cancel (memory?)
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(rdma_create_id); Create (?) ID
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(rdma_create_qp); Create Queue Pair (WQ,CQ)
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(rdma_destroy_qp); Destroy Queue Pair (WQ,CQ)
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(rdma_init_qp_attr); Set Initial Queue Pair Attributes (?)
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(rdma_destroy_id); Destroy (?) ID
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(rdma_listen); Listen (to ... socket, port, pipe, what?)
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(rdma_resolve_route); Resolve Route (datagram path?)
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(rdma_resolve_addr); Resolve Address (memory?)
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(rdma_bind_addr); Bind Address (memory?)
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(rdma_connect); Connect
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(rdma_accept); Accept
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(rdma_reject); Reject
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(rdma_disconnect); Disconnect
Address vs. IP - I know we're talking about a net/dma kluge here, but the
twin usage is bugging me.  I'm intuiting the _addr as memory addresses,
rather than IP addresses, which seem to be _ip, but my poor gray goo
suffers pointer overload.
INFINIBAND
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(ib_get_rmpp_segment); Reliable MultiPacket Protocol
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(ib_copy_qp_attr_to_user); Push Queue Pair Attribute
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(ib_copy_path_rec_to_user); Push Path Record
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(ib_copy_path_rec_from_user); Retrieve Path Record
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(ib_modify_qp_is_ok); Yes, Modify Queue Pair, or "QP is
OK", or "QP was Modified OK"?
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(ip_dev_find); Find IP device (sub(/ip/, "ib")? find the
network interface device?)

*Can* work that uses them be merged?  Code that requires a non-GPL
export?
