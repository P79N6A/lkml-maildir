On the default memory settings it may do. However a request for 2Gb of
memory requires there is a free 2Gb of address space to map it into -
which may not be true because of things like shared libraries. 
The actual total allocatable limit for x86 is a bit under 3Gb, but you 
won't get that as one linear allocation. (1Gb is kernel mappings)
