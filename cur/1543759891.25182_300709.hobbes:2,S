Ick, Alan, couldn't you have had the decency to run this through the USB
developers, and at least pinged me on it?  Especially due to all of the
hate-email I have gotten over this driver in the past.
As it is, the coding style sucks in places, and you didn't really need
to make it a new subdirectory (although due to the increased size of the
driver, it's probably better now...)
And, there's no MAINTAINERS entry for who I need to bug about this
thing.
Bleah.
So, who's going to fix up:
	- the MAINTAINERS entry
	- the coding style
	- drop that unneeded changelog file
	- fix the module help text to point to the proper file (or put
	  the file in the proper place.)
	- get rid of the c++ crud in the header file
	- drop the "magic" nonsense
	- the ioctls to work on 64bit machines
?
And I found all of that in just a quick glance over the code...
Double bleah.
