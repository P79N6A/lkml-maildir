I personally think the driver is OK (works for me like a charm with my Samsung
drive), but as I reported a few times, SiI will corrupt data if ext-p2p
discard time setting in bios is set to too low values.
So, Jeff, don't you think adding a quirk to the kernel would prevent such
reports. (I am damn sure, this reports are cause of the setting I am talking
about.) Perhaps you could ask SiI how to do this in the kernel...
