That's a bit of a hack which really doesn't belong in the git tools.
It's not particularly hard to reparent the tree for real -- I'd much
rather see a tool added to git which can _actually_ change the
1da177e4c3f41524e886b7f1b8a0c1fc7321cac2 commit to have a parent of
0bcc493c633d78373d3fcf9efc29d6a710637519, and ripple the corresponding
SHA1 changes up to the current HEAD.
Note that the latter commit ID I gave there was actually the 2.6.12-rc2
commit in Thomas' history import, not your own. Thomas has done a lot of
work on it, and it has the full names extracted from the shortlog
script, full timestamps, branch/merge history and consistent character
sets in the commit logs. I'd definitely suggest that you use that
instead of the import from bkcvs.
