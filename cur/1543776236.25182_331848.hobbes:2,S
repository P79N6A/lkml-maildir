If you ping an IP address on your computer, the traffic will go
through lo. However, I think that the IP address shown is
the result of an instrumentation error because it is impossible
to put, for instance your 192.168.1.1, through a 127.0.0.0 network,
the ONLY route through lo. This shows that 'local' traffic bypasses
the lo route filtering altogether. You can verify this by
deleting the lo route altogether, you can still ping the local
addresses.
Somebody else mentioned that lo was 'perfectly happy' to
carry whatever. The fact that something bogus appears on
lo can be a sign of a misconfiguration error, just as
the reserved 127.0.0.0 network must never appear on ethernet.
In the case of 0.0.0.0 (a possible broadcast), there is
no "local" address that could cause a bypass via lo. Instead,
any such traffic should have been on the ethernet wire. This
shows the possible configuration error that I mentioned.

This looks as though there is no netmask set. My configuration
shows:
lo        Link encap:Local Loopback
           inet addr:127.0.0.1  Mask:255.0.0.0
           inet6 addr: ::1/128 Scope:Host
           UP LOOPBACK RUNNING  MTU:16436  Metric:1
This is a possible configuration error.
