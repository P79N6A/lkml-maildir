Hi there.

 > poweroff on shutdown doesn't work (Yes, I use the -p option).

When I upgraded from 2.0.36 to 2.2.1, I had the opposite problem: The
system was powering off when the screen blanker kicked in, at times
when it was definately an undesired action...
I managed to cure it by (of all things) doing...
 Q> cd /sun/Mirrors/updates.redhat.com/5.2/kernel-2.2/i386/
 Q> rpm -Uvh *.rpm
...when in the NFS-mounted SunSITE-UK mirror of updates.redhat.com -
all I know is, the problem was there before I did that, and not
after, but what precicely changed, I have no idea...
Best wishes from Riley.
