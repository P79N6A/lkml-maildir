So they are, as of 2.3. We have customers who will not run development
phase software. Some of our customers like to run incredibly high
port densities (in a previous position here I dealt with a customer
who wanted access to hundreds of 16 port modules _from_a_single_system).
Still give me 1024 ports easily with the current structure.
Especially with devices that can be reconfigured on the fly.

Which is more or less exactly what devfsd does for devfs.
Any time you have a /dev that is dynamic _at_all_ you have
to deal with the problems that devfs has, and there are only
so many ways to do that and stay sane.  
In addition devfs does away with problems of over persistence of device
nodes and permissions on them that we haven't even begun to see under
Linux, but which are fairly common under systems that commonly
use dynamic Major number allocation for drivers (SCO Openserver 
for one example that I am too familiar with).  Let us not follow
their example, please.

There _usually_ isn't at that kind of port count, but some
of the most demanding port densities are also the most
demanding configurations port by port.
