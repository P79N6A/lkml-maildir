  Ok. But from my point of view this is just a question of data structures (
  int or long or even long long or even void * ). Remember what I was asking
  about ? I asked about examples "where my scheme wouldn't work *at all*".

  More filesystems with ids longer than  32bits  ?

  Huh! I'm not a great fan of the beasts like khttpd, but as far as I can 
predict, I guess that sooner or later we will get kncpfsd or even ksmbfsd.

  Ok. I do understand you. But than the first thing we ought to do is to
sit down and write a list of the things not defined in RFC[1094|1813] but
badly needed by Linux community. It's ok. Let's start it. I do not think
that everything what can be found in knfsd sources has a reasonable
explanation ( not talking about implementation at all ).

  If you're talking about *my* code than you've got me wrong. I was trying
to draw your attention to your proposal. But have failed ?

  Well, than we should start to work out:
     1. what we *need* from knfsd at a user level besides RFC.
     2. interface to fhandle operations.
     3. implementation details of stuff like subtrees.

  I agree, but than they must be real subtrees. Not imaginary knfsd creatures.
I guess, I'm a bit late and Al has explained everything about what should be 
done in this direction.

  No. Or I'm completely out of context.

  And it will be there. But at lower price. I'm not sure but I guess that we 
can't proceed without introducing significant interactions between knfsd and
union mount stuff. From my point of view ( I'll try to read recent kernel to 
be 99.9% sure ) not only the right way but the only way to cope with the
situation is to create vfsmount for each export. At least this will solve 
a problem with subtrees and let us export filesystems in the most natural way.
Thanks,
Roman.
