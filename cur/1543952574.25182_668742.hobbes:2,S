I have found this requirement in the SD host controller spec:
"The card detect is active regardless of the SD Bus Power."
I wonder how the card should be able to pull up the CD/DAT3 Pad to VCC
if its only VCC pad is not connected to VCC due to the fact that the host
controller has switched off the cards power - any idea how this could be
managed?
There is a SD card spec section somewhere which statet that:
"If one of the supply pins (VDD or VSS) is not connected properly, then
the current is drawn through a data line to supply the card."
Maybe this is the key in understanding ho the pull up without VCC connected
works?
Thanks,
