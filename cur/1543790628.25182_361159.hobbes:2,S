John, 
Don't waste any time on this.  This was caused by a brain fart on
Thomas' part :-)  Some legacy code in ktimer_interrupt returned a enum
that was being used to update the ticks.  So before high-res was
activated, the jiffies would be incremented 7 times instead of just
once.  It's already been fixed. Just waiting for Ingo to release his new
patch.
