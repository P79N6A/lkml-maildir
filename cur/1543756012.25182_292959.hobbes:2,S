Hi Ove,

Your patch looks correct (for 2.4 - 2.6 uses a different approach), but 
I'm not certain that it's needed:
You assume that signals have an immediate effect.
Linux ignores that - it delays signal processing under some 
circumstances. If a syscall can be completed without blocking, then the 
syscall is handled, regardless of any pending signals. The signal is 
handled at the syscall return, i.e. after completing the syscall.
That's not just in SysV semaphore - at least pipes are identical:
pipe_read first check if there is data. If there is some, then it 
returns the data. Signals are only checked if there is no pending data.
I'm not sure if this is a bug. But if it's one, then far more than just 
sysv sem must be updated.
What about other unices? I've attached a test app that tests pipes. 
Could someone try it?
