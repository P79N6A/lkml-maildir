  You say that as if it were a bad thing... I believe that if you have
one long running task and many small tasks in the system CPU affinity
will make that happen now. Obviously not if all CPUs are 100% loaded,
and your 1 vs. 49 is unrealistic, but having a task stay with a CPU
while trivia run on other CPU(s) is generally a good thing under certain
load conditions, which I guess are no less likely than your example;-)
