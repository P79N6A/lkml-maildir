They all give you foo-pointer-to-T.  
	T (__attribute__((foo)) *v);
would give pointer-to-foo-T.

Since __context__ is (sparse-only) keyword, we are not constrained by
anything anyway.

Yup, except that it would not accept storage-class-like attributes (e.g.
always_inline).  And yes, __qualifier__((context(...))) probably might
be a replacement for __context__, to reduce the number of primitives.
