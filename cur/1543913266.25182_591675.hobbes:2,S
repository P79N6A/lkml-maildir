Hmm, I can't really see anything wrong. This means the original
version of the patch you found had a few problems, but they
were all fixed later and only applied with CONFIG_PARAVIRT enabled anyways.
As a stab in the dark since the CPU has clflush can you please 
comment out the  
  if (cpu_has_clflush)
                asm("clflush (%0) " :: "r" (addr) : "memory");
statement in arch/i386/kernel/alternative.c and see if it makes a difference?
Perhaps your CPU doesn't like that (it seems to have clflush) 
If that doesn't help it might be needed to revert the patch
hunk by hunk to see which text_poke() invocation caused it.
