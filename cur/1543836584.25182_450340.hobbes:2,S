Well boy, this has to be the most-reviewed patch ever.  You'd think that
I'd apply it with great confidence and warm fuzzies.
However...
From: Andrew Morton <akpm@osdl.org>
- one decl per line is more patching-friendly and a bit more idiomatic.
- make `bad_count' an int: a uchar might overflow
- Put a blank line between decls and code
- rename `total' to `error', remove `errors'.
- there's no need to sum up the errors.
- don't need to check for non-zero `errors': we know it is != POISON_FREE.
- make it look non-crapful in an 80-col window.
- add missing spaces in arithmetic
