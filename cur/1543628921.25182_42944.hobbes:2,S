Perhaps. But it works now and can easily be modified later if better 
approach comes along.

Yes that would work fine. But it would still need the iget4 like find actor 
and opaque pointer to do the "checks hash table" part...
Basically one could just change iget4 into two functions: iget calling 
fs->read_inode (with read_inode2 removed) and iget4 without the 
->read_inode and ->read_inode2 and returning a locked inode instead.
That would make it fs specific.
If we wanted to make it generic we do need a special method in the 
operations, but wait, we already have read_inode2! So perhaps it isn't as 
much of a hack after all...
If you wanted to get rid of the hackish nature of the beast, one could just 
remove ->read_inode and rename ->read_inode2 to ->read_inode. Then change 
all fs to accept two dummy parameters in their ->read_inode declaration...
If that would be an acceptable approach I would be happy to do a patch to 
convert all in kernel file systems in 2.5.x.
Best regards,
Anton
