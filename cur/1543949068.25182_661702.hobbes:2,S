Subject: [RFC][PATCH] cpuidle: avoid singing capacitors
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/2/29/271

Many devices today are of a less than stellar quality, and singing
transistors are a common problem. A high-pitch noise is created, caused
by power fluctuations as the processor enters and leaves deep sleep at
a high frequency.
Instead of just disabling the deep sleep (which wastes power). This
patch merely reduces the number of times it is entered so that the
frequency doesn't exceed 500 Hz. That should make sure the problem is
inaudible.

The basic idea is above, but the implementation doesn't quite work. It seems jiffies is not a good time source in this scenario. The time spent in C3 takes a much bigger hit than I expect. The fact that powertop says that it has an average residency of 200 ms in C2 tells me that those should have been spent in C3.
So, pointers on what else to do?
(Patch also needs an on/off switch, but that's a later problem)
