peraphs we should add a check on the compiler and force people to use
gcc >= 3?
Otherwise adding an #ifdef will fix 2.95, just like the spinlock does in
UP.
btw, the only machine where I still have gcc 2.95.3 is not uptodate
enough to run 2.6 regardless of the fact 2.6 could compile on such
machine or not.
