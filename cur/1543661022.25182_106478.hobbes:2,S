ohhh, 48GB. I forgot you were doing the silly-amounts-of-mem thing.
Its extremely likely you'll have to fix up those comments Andi made,
and possibly some other parts too.  That code should be 64bit clean
now (due to x86-64 sharing it), but there may still be some gotchas,
especially on weird-ass systems like what you've been playing with 8)
