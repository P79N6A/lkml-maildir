In those cases the I2C (or SPI) bus will normally be hanging off
some arch/XX/mach-YY/gpio.c platform code, which will usually be
set up so it's "always there".  (As noted by the docs in patch 3/6
of this series.)  Such code often initializes very early, sometimes
even before IRQs are enabled or kmalloc works.
Bitbanging through an I2C or SPI expander would be possible, but
doesn't seem especially practical.  :)

It's just a routine case of init this before that.  Again, the
dependency issue is noted in the docs in patch 3/6 of this series.
Linking these expanders early reduces such problems, it can never
get rid of them.
It's really no different than needing to hold off initialization
of any other device until the I2C based GPIOs are ready, like the
leds-gpio example [1] I posted some time ago.

    See evm_led_setup(), setting up the leds-gpio device as a
    child of the GPIO expander; and evm_u18_setup(), setting
    up a switch attribute as a child of a different expander.
