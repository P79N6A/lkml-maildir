The sort of feature you are describing would really belong in a
separate layer, somewhat analogous to the MD driver, but for defect
management.  You could create a virtual block device that has 90% of
the capacity of the real block device, then allocte spare blocks from
the real device if and when blocks failed.

Modern disk devices typically already do this kind of defect management.

It does if you are trying to avoid likely failiures, which is what I
was originally thinking about.
Imagine a four-track tape.  It would be valid reasoning to store
important data such as the directory structure on the two inner
tracks, on the basis that the outer tracks were more susceptable to
edge damage.  If blocks are allocated on all tracks at the same time,
that might mean storing the directory on blocks 2,3,6,7,10,11, etc.
Such a layout wouldn't be very useful on a disk where blocks 1-8 were
written on one track, and 9-16 on the next, because the directory
would needlessly span two tracks.
John.
