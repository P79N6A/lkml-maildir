"The file system mounted on /tmp/z in the example contains 2^50
directories".   heh.
I do wonder how realistic this problem is in real life.

I wonder if we should be setting shrink_parents=1 in
shrink_dcache_memory()?  Because we have this problem where the dentry
slabs suffer lots of internal fragmentation and we end up with whole slab
pages pinned by a single directory dentry.  I expect that if
shrink_dcache_memory() were aggressive about reaping newly-childless
directory dentries, some improvements might be realised there.
If so, we should change prune_dcache() to return the number pruned, so that
shrink_dcache_memory() can keep its arithmetic correct.  Would require some
careful testing and is out of scope for your work.
