Anybody running on a machine with some zone empty (<16Mbyte boxes (PDAs),
<1G x86 with highmem enabled kernel or an arch with an iommu like alpha)
probably noticed that the MM was unusable on those hardware
configurations (as I also incidentally mentioned a few times on l-k in
the last months).
Yesterday I checked and here it is the fix (included in 2.4.5aa3).
