Indeed, you are right, which is supported by actual measurements:

Sorry for implying that anybody has engineered a drive that can do
such a nice thing with writeback cache.
The "disk motor as a generator" tale may not be purely folklore.  When
an IDE drive is not in writeback mode, something special needs to done
to ensure the last write to media is not a scribble.
A small UPS can make writeback mode actually reliable, provided the
system is smart enough to take the drives out of writeback mode when
the line power is off.
