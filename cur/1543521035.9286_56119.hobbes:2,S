This is the correct behaviour the code must follow.
Even if it has just stored the value in foo ( 3 ) and even it can think that
the value is %edx is the last one, the volatile keyword force a reload in 5.
The step 4 is not clear for me !
IMVHO doing a jiffies++ or (*(unsigned long *)&jiffies)++ is exactly the same
thing in this case.
I mean that :
incl	jiffies
or
movl	jiffies, %eax
incl	%eax
movl	%eax, jiffies
does not introduce worse issues in SMP.
Sure the volatile keyword avoid the compiler to optimize :
movl	jiffies, %eax
incl	%eax
...
movl	%eax, jiffies
As a general rule I suggest to introduce any tricks that can solve speed or
code optimization issues where there's the need, avoiding them in caseless
situations.
Cheers,
	Davide.
