Have you tried using a different block size to see how that effects the 
results? There might be some funny interaction there.

It's somewhat intentional that some of the hdparm commands (like for 
settting transfer modes, enable/disable DMA, etc.) don't work with 
libata. Most of them aren't necessary at all as correct DMA settings, 
etc. should always be set automatically (if not, please report as a bug).

It's the same libata code, so the same applies to some of the hdparm 
commands not being implemented, as above.
