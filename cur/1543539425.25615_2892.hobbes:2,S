I could not find an absolute statement of this requirement, just lots
of mail about spinlock optimisation that assume strong write ordering.
See 
http://www.uwsg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/9911.3/0148.html
where Linus says "Basically, everybody agrees on ordering of writes".
It would be nice if the kernel gods made a definitive statement about
the need or otherwise for strong write ordering.

IA64 load.acquire and store.release are available to do strong write
ordering, although the default option is weak order.
