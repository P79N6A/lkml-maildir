The difference here is that with .po files we have tools
to report the actual translation status.
And having the .po files included in the source makes it
much easier to use the latest versions.
The Linux Kernel Translation Project
http://tlktp.sourceforge.net/
have nice statisitcs for the different translations.
Italian is 100% followed by Hungarian with almost 70%.
We have a number of dedicated people, so why not
make the works available to more users by including it
in the kernel.
I trust the tlktp people enough that we will not see patches
for the language with less than ~5% translated strings.
I would assume that Japanese soon get higher btw - there
is quite a number of people listed as translators.
