Subject: [PATCH] Fix CPU bitmask truncation (1 of 2)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2003/1/2/167

The consensus is that this fixes a real bug in 2.4.20.  The
rationale is (in Linus' words):
>         1 << cpu
> is clearly an int, and as such will have undefined behaviour for cpu >
> bits-of-int.
> The promotion to unsigned long happens _after_ the shift has already
> happened as an int, since nothing in the sub-expression needs promotion
> per se.
I'll send the initialization patch separately, in case you don't
want that one.
