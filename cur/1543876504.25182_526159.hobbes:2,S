Err, what are you talking about ?
The clock events code in arch/i386/kernel/i8253.c does not have any
quirks. It's straight forward. The only quirk is in pit_read() and we
can simply make it depend on !64bit.

Right, but this is better spent than having two implementations of the
same thing around.
