Recent binutils warn about symbols marked as discardable but referenced
when the driver is built-in instead of modularized. Older ones just shut up.
Original explanation:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=100753194504523&w=2
Corrected mainly in 2.4.17-pre6 (and some leftovers in following pres).
From ChangeLog-2.4.17:
pre6:
...
- Create __devexit_p() function and use that on 
  drivers which need it to make it possible to
  use newer binutils                (Keith Owens)

OK.
My ISP has reached the spam-black-lists ? I'm beginning to think that
those lists are becoming useless. Everybody is there. Some day someone
will manage to send just ONE message faking vger and the linux kernel
list will be banned...
