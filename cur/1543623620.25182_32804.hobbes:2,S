Not unless the VM is really bad... All that is called for is that the
virtual space be available. Each umls gets 64 MB, but the rest is guaranteed
available via swap. Nothing has to swap until all processes have expanded
to use all available ram. Currently the only way to ensure that the memory
IS available is to modify every page at startup. Yes it will swap the modified
pages.
But it should only do so once, until the pages are really needed.
Otherwise the umls run until the system goes OOM - then somebody gets killed.
Much nicer to have it die at the beginning instead of after 4-5 hours of
operation when it needs just "one more page" only to find out that the system
lied when it said it was available.
