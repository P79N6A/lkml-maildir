not to make a big issue out of this, but when was the last time you 
tried to grep this way:
  grep -E "audit_rate_limit=[0-9]+ audit_backlog" */*.c
?
That's pretty much the only grep pattern that would break. People 
usually grep on the constant portion of the string, so breaking up a 
line along a variable boundary is perfectly okay.
