I've seen the exact same behavior with my CUV4X-D (2x1GHz) under
2.4.2 (debian woody).  In addition, the kernel would sometimes hang
around NMI watchdog enable.  At least, I think it's trying to
`enable'.  The hang would occur around 50% of boot attempts.  Once
booted, everything was stable.  A non-SMP 2.4.2 kernel (no IO-APIC
either, sorry, didn't test that) always booted without hangs.
Strangely, (happily for me,) the boot hangs stopped with 2.4.3.
I've booted maybe 10 times (hot and cold) since I built 2.4.3 and
I've had no hangs.  When I get back to the box, I'll try booting
a few dozen more times and see if I can confirm your observation.
