This is one subcase, but one of many.

The flaw in your understanding comes in when you want to run maintenance 
on a system, reinstall it, install a system for which you don't have 
drivers, etc.  Otherwise you're basically requiring the memory on the 
target system to contain every driver that could possibly exist, not 
just today but in the future.
