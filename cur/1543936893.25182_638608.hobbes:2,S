You can use DIO_CREDITS instead of len >> 9, just like the ext3
O_DIRECT code does.  Your current patch is fine, except it breaks
data=ordered rules.  My plan to work within data=ordered:
1) Inside ext3_map_extent (while the transaction was running), increment
a counter in the ext3 journal for number of pending IOs.  Then end the
transaction handle.
2) Drop this counter inside the IO completion call
3) Change the ext3 commit code to wait for the IO count to be zero.
I'll give it a shot later this week, until then your current patch is
just data=writeback, which is good enough for testing.
