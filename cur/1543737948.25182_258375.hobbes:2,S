OK. I'm not sure that I like the direction, but... (I haven't looked
too closely at it).

Although what we have in -mm now should support CPU hotplug just fine.
The hotplug guys really seem not to care how disruptive a hotplug
operation is.

Hmm, what was my word for them... yeah, disjoint. We can do that now,
see isolcpus= for a subset of the functionality you want (doing larger
exclusive sets would probably just require we run the setup code once
for each exclusive set we want to build).

This is what I did in my first (that nobody ever saw) implementation of
sched domains. Ie. no sched_groups, just use sched_domains as the balancing
object... I'm not sure this works too well.
For example, your bottom level domain is going to basically be a redundant,
single CPU on most topologies, isn't it?
Also, how will you do overlapping domains that SGI want to do (see
arch/ia64/kernel/domain.c in -mm kernels)?
node2 wants to balance between node0, node1, itself, node3, node4.
node4 wants to balance between node2, node3, itself, node5, node6.
etc.
I think your lists will get tangled, no?
