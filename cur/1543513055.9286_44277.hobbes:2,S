Just wanted to report PCI problems with 2.3.21.  I have tried Martin
Mares patch posted a couple of days ago; it did not help.
Symptoms:  Most of my PCI devices are not recognized or properly
configured by 2.3.21 upon boot.  I don't get any OOPses or crashes, but
many devices don't work.  The system is a Dell Latitude CPi D266XT
Laptop.  It works fine under 2.2.13 (up to and including pre16).

I would love to help out debugging the 2.3 series, but I can't help much
when the PCI support doesn't work.  I am more than willing to provide
further info, run further tests, etc -- whatever anyone wants me to do.
Cheers,
