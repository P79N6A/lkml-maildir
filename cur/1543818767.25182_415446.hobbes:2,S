Do you really intend to say that you are the common case, and that this
5K really matters? I'm all for removing bloat, but not without looking
at the real savings vs the cost.

You're making a bogus leap from "sometimes" to "average".
Assuming an even distribution of lengths mod 4096, less than 5% of the
time will 200 bytes save any memory on a module.
Since we're both making big assumptions, only real numbers from built
modules would be convincing.

Testing for VLAN_ENABLED in an if statement is better than the ifdefs, I
agree, but I still find it ugly. Probably not ugly enough to argue about
it any more.
I don't like "VLAN_ENABLED" as a global define -- it looks too much like
something local. The CONFIG_VLAN... defines were more descriptive.
I didn't think about this before, but I'm pretty sure you're taking away
functionality. When I wrote the typhoon driver, ISTR that I looked
through the vlan implantation, and determined that all the #ifdefs on
CONFIG_VLAN_8021Q were not really needed, since all the hooks were
there. You could just load the 8021q module (even perhaps building it at
a later date), and it would work if you had filled in the hooks in
struct net_device. So I didn't #ifdef out code in my driver to let the
user have the option.
You're taking that away in the name of a total of 5K, which most users
won't actually get back?
