Looks like you've misunderstood me. I was talking only about mem-to-dev 
and dev-to-mem DMA transfers, where dev is actually an SPI device. The 
thing I was talking about was that the 'wrappers' are necessary to call 
*real* copy_from_user/copy_to_user with the appropriate parameters. I 
hope this can also be derived by looking in the code.

Ok, readily agreeing to that.
But -- does the interfaces review imply checking wthether the figure 
brackets are complying to K&R? ;)
