Can anyone shed some light on this problem for me? I've heard some
people say that you have to  disable the second CPU on an SMP board to
get linux to install, but I've heard other people say it isn't true. If
something doesn't look quite right in the above output, please excuse,
its possibly a typo since I had to hand copy the error message, but I
tried to double check it as I went. TIA.
