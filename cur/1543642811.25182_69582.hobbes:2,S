Thanks for telling me this, but I know it.  The manner in which the
module use count is protected is completely irrelvant to the code I
showed.  The cleanup_module just knows the count is protected and
stable.

You promised to find a race or some other deficiency in my code and
you pointed out some other interesting, but incidental fact.
If you look at my code snippet for cleanup_module, you'll see it
doesn't decrement anything, though it could if it wanted to, because
it's called under protection provided by module.c.
The way the module keeps track of its unloadable/not unloadable
state is up to it, which makes sense, n'est-ce pas?  Given that
there is no way you can make the MOD_DEC_USE_COUNT concept work
for SCM, for example.
There is in fact no choice other than to bite the bullet and
implement some form of magic_wait_for_quiescent_state(), however
hard that may be, to be used in the cases where some precise
accounting method simply isn't possible.  The alternative is to
forbid unloading of some types of modules, and I hope you
realize what kind of criticism that would invite.
Anyway, solutions to the difficulties are known.  We are simply
quibbling over whether we should use an obscure interface or a
simple, transparent one.
