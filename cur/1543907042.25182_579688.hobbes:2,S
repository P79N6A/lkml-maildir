I can reproduce this behaviour by doing the following with kernel 2.6.20 :
1. <Fn>+<F4>   - the systems sleeps within RAM
2. <Fn>             - the systems wakes up
3. <Fn>+<F12> - the systems hibernates to disk
4. <power>       - systems wakes up
5. <Fn>+<F4>   - the systems sleeps within RAM
Now pressing <Fn> doesn't wake up the system, I have to press the power button
for that instead.
BTW I tried to test the latest git-sources -rc2 but the <Fn> keys do not work
anymore with the thinkpad-acpi feature (neither as module nor if compiled into).
