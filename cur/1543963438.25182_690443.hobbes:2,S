AFAIK the reason for this is that pmd_huge() and pud_huge() are
completely x86-specific. When I looked at the huge page support for
other archs in Linux the last time, all of them marked hugepages with
some page size bits in the PTE, using several PTEs for a single huge
page. So for anything but x86, the pgd/pud/pmd/pte hierarchy should work
for hugepages, too.

Proper hugepage support in /proc/pid/pagemap would be very helpful for
certain kinds of performance analysis, like TLB usage, where you need
page size information when you have a TLB for each supported page size.
That was the reason why I was working on supporting huge pages in
/proc/pid/pagemap in the first place.
