At least the ipc ones are supposed to be DOS limits not behavior
modifiers.  I do admit from looking at the code that there are some
consequences of increasing things like shmmni.  However I think we
would be better off with  better data structures and implementations
that remove these consequences than this autotuning of
denial-of-service limits.
i.e. I think you are treating the symptom not the problem.
Does this make sense?
