I see. Also, AMD specs say that either higher C-states are enabled, or
C1E, but not both at the same time. So if the BIOS doesn't offer an
option to disable C1E, it can't provide _CST or P_LVL* ACPI
objects for higher C-states.
Dynticks also provides lower latencies as far as I know. I think this
workaround should be merged, even if as a non-default config option.
I'll resubmit a patch if you agree.
(By the way, sorry for messing up the "Cc:" fields in the previous
message.)
