Wouldn't it be perfectly ok if we just made sure to keep the disk device 
refcount elevated by the _mount_?
Ie Russell's patch to elevate it around everything didn't work, but 
elevating the bdev->bd_disk reference count by a mount, and dropping it on 
umount (after doing the umount event) should be ok. No?
