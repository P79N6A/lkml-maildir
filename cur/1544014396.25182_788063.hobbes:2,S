I have a couple questions if you don't mind.
In wake_idle() there's an odd looking check for kthreads.  Why does it
matter if a kbuild task wakes kernel or userland helper thread?
I also don't see why sched_mc overrides domain tunings.  You can turn
NEWIDLE off and sched_mc remains as set, so it's a one-way override.  If
NEWIDLE is a requirement for sched_mc > 0, it seems only logical to set
sched_mc to 0 if the user explicitly disables NEWIDLE.
