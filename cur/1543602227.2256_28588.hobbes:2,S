I disagree that it's a once-off activity.  I've been known to switch
between ext2 and ext3 and ext2 and ext3...  just so I can boot old
kernels such as rescue disks.  It's nice to be able to do this.
Also I don't think resize2fs resizes the journal (but I may be wrong),
so I've converted ext3 to ext2 to resize a filesystem, then converted
back.
I did have a big disaster once when I compiled ext3 into a kernel and
not ext2 (which I left as a module).  You can guess, it couldn't mount
the root filesystem.
