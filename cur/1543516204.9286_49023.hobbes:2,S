Hi,
	When mounting a DVD-ROM (the region 2 Titanic - dual layered "type: 9"
one) I seem to only get the first layer of the disc and cannot seem to
access the remaining data. Is there a mount option I ought to be using
that I'm not or something? I thought that it might be implemented as two
"partitions" which are mounted separately, but that doesn't seem to be
the case.
Can someone help me out here (it plays right up until the ship starts to
sink and then sinks itself :-)
Jon.
