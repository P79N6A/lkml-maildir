They will change in the next chunks. In particular, we'll need
rwlock for these two instead of mount_sem.
Current locking rules for fs/super.c are mess. It used to be completely
under BKL and nobody cared much about races there, so lots of things
are sloppy. As usual - there is no such thing as SMP-only race...
New variant makes much more sense, but I'm feeding it in small chunks and
one of the obvious requirements is that at every stage situation should
be better or same as on the previous step. It's -STABLE, damnit.
