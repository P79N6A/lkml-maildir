Ok, I admit, I do the same thing.  I manually mount.  But let's get in
the head of a user, why should they care what type of 5 inch round shiny
thing they just inserted?
Are there any cases where udf filesystems are present on cdrom's that should
be read as iso9660?  Someone mentioned it's a hard heuristic to figure out
which fake filename the empty iso9660 filesystem uses.  How about, instead,
pick the larger of the two filesystems if both are present.
