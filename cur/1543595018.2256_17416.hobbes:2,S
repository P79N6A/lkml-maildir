Linus *is*, however, implicitly claiming the authority to make license
policy on behalf of the other copyright holders in cases where the GPL
is unclear.
In COPYING, Linus says that that the version of GPL applying to the
kernel is v2 unless explicitly otherwise stated.  He has also already
issued the interpretation that normal system calls from userland do
not create a derivation relationship.
I consider Linus to have the moral right to make these decisions, whether
or not the law gives him a formal legal right to do so.  All I have done
is propose that he be more explicit about his policy in order to prevent
needless confusion and nervousness.
