	This reads:  "all of the specified effects of the other call,
or none of them."  If I read that correctly, if f_pos is at N, and
threads A and B concurrently read M bytes, then each thread's read()
must either start at f_pos = N or f_pos = N+M, but never at N < f_pos <
N+M.  So as long as our code doesn't partially update f_pos, it is
valid.  
	Of course, that doesn't change the possible race updating
f_pos at the end of each thread's call.
