Hum, I call cancel_delayed_work() as well as flush_workqueue() at module exit:
static void __exit cfag12864b_exit(void)
{
...
+       cfag12864b_disable();
...
}
And cfag12864b_disable() will call them, as fast as the mutex is
unlocked (in fact, modules must call cfag12864b_disable() when they
finish working with the LCD, as cfag12864bfb, for example, does, but
just for be safe, I called it at module unload in cfag12864b. If it is
already disabled, it won't hurt in any way.)
Is that right?
