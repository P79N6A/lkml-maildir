After checking the early_ioremap() implementation in
arch/x86/kernel/setup_32.c, I found that it is a duplication of
bt_ioremap() implementation in arch/x86/mm/ioremap_32.c. Both
implementations use set_fixmap(), so they can be used only after
paging_init().
The early_ioremap implementation provided in this patchset works as
follow:
- Enhances bt_ioremap, make it usable before paging_init() via a
dedicated PTE page.
- Rename bt_ioremap to early_ioremap
So I think maybe we should replace the early_ioremap() implementation in
PAT series with that of this series.
