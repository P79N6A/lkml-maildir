I'm seeing the same behaviour on my machine (t9-bk26,SMP,HT,preeemp,P4), the 
last line displayed is:
ahc_pci:3:6:0: Host Adapter Bios disabled.  Using default SCSI device 
parameters
And after this the boot procedure is stopped.
The following message, with bk23, is:
scsi0 : Adaptec AIC7XXX EISA/VLB/PCI SCSI HBA DRIVER, Rev 6.2.35
         <Adaptec 2902/04/10/15/20/30C SCSI adapter>
         aic7850: Single Channel A, SCSI Id=7, 3/253 SCBs
