Yeah, that's the right analysis. ReiserFS caches bitmaps on mount and
for large file systems it can take a quite a long time. I've heard
reports of up to 15 minutes on multi-TB file systems.
As far as these patches getting accepted, Hans was opposed to them
initially, but emailed in September saying he decided that they should
be accepted after all.
These were against 2.6.12.1, and I remerged and split the patches out
yesterday evening. I'm going to do a bit of testing and send them out on
Monday for inclusion in -mm.
