Hi,
some days ago I installed 2.6.1 here and immediately
noticed a slower bootup time.
The disk during boot is also very much  showing a lot more
activity.
And the same when starting up a new program.
Was there a change that explains this?
I just reinstalled 2.6.0 and everything went back to being
quite peaceful.
My configuration:
- 2 x 500MHz P-III
- NCR 53c875 SCSI controller
- Preemption enabled
- 512 MB memory
