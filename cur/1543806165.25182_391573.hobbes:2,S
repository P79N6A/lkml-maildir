If you are configuring a bus-master for DMA transfer across the
PCI/Bus, you need to make sure that all the messages got to the
device. The PCI/Bus is a FIFO. If you are writing a lot of stuff
to your board, it may wait, depending upon where it is "parked"
for more data to be written. To make sure that everything gets
to your hardware NOW, execute a dummy READ in your hardware's
address space immediately after the last instruction that is
supposed to start the DMA. Also, you need to make that READ
in some way that the 'C' compiler won't delete it as an unnecessary
instruction, i.e., (void)readl(addr) may not work! You need to
make an assignment to something that could get accessed like
junk = readl(status), where junk is global! The "volatile-ness"
of the readl() macro won't protect you from having the instruction
deleted entirely when the 'C' compiler determines that the
code "does nothing"!
