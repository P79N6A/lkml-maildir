Hi,
I got this bug report a while ago:

This is caused by the fact applesmc_backlight_set locks a mutex (or more
precisely sleeps while trying to lock a mutex) while being in a softirq
context.
This might be obvious for others, but it was not for me, and there is
absolutely no mention in the documentation of the fact it is not always
safe to sleep in the brightness_set handler of a led_class device (it is
safe when it is called because someone wrote to the brightness sysfs file).
So, with the patch below, in case the mutex is locked for another
operation, the "brightness_set" called by the led trigger is simply
ignored. I don't think it is the behaviour we want, and I think it would
be a good idea to try again a little while afterwards. Richard, would
you like me to provide a patch for this? It would imply adding a
parameter to brightness_set indicating whether it's safe to sleep or
not, make it return an int, and modify the triggers code to retry if the
return value indicates an error.
Also, the led-trigger code seems buggy when it comes to locking. Setting
CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK_SLEEP causes a lot a warnings. The problem is that
the list of triggers is locked using a rw spinlock, but the rest of the
code seems to ignore that, and calls a lot of functions which can sleep
(kzalloc with GFP_KERNEL, sysfs_add_file, mutex_lock, etc...). I think
the list lock should be converted to a mutex (or maybe modified to use
RCU). I'm not very experienced in that domain, but if you want I can
provide a patch for this.
Best regards,
Nicolas
Cannot sleep in led->brightness_set handler if it is called from a softirq.
Reduce wait_status timetout from 100ms to 2ms, as wait_status either takes less
than 1.5 ms, or fails.
