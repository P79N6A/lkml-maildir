If I understand you, you are saying don't change how we notify the app,
change how we notify the user and if it is the user that needs to act
then we should sidestep the app entirely by creating a new method that
talks to the user, including popping up a window if the user is using a
GUI, and doing some other configurable thing for other circumstances. 
We could even create a mapping of errors to what the system should do in
response to them that the user can modify for the rare case that they
care to.  Ok, I agree.
