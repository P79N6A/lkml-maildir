No. "It is planned to merge all three classification-directories into
one place at /sys/subsystem/", but the they will still be available
for backwards compat, and continue to export silly details like
differentiation between class- and bus-devices in the userspace
export.

You enter a well defined directory of symlinks, that directory is
named "block". What's so difficult here?

"It is planned to merge ..." Today it exists only as a patch and will
show up when the block-conversion eventually gets merged. It will be
/sys/subsystem/$SUBSYSTEM/, just like /sys/bus looks today but
containing _all_ devices from _all_ subsytems in _one_ place with
_one_ access rule. Again, please look at the udev or HAL code, it's
all pretty easy to understand by reading the code.

There are only symlinks in /sys/bus, no attributes to "find" here.

Usb and firewire have device nodes at bus devices.
  $ ls -l /sys/bus/usb/devices/*/dev
  /sys/bus/usb/devices/1-2/dev
  /sys/bus/usb/devices/4-1/dev
  ...

SUBSTEM=="block" are block devices, everything else are char devices.
Class-  or bus-devices can be anything, you need to know the subsystem
to distinguish them.
Unfortunately the "dev" file itself does not contain "c123:123",
"b234:8" that would be the proper solution, but reading the subsytem
works fine too for a long time.

Sure, that would be nice. any help documenting it in the right way, is
appreciated.
