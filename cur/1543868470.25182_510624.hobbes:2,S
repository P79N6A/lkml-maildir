setup_irq() is where things go wrong, at least for us, at least on
2.6.16.x.  Interrupts are not disabled at the point in request_irq()
when the interrupt controller is poked to enable the IRQ source.  If
you're lucky, and you're on an architecture where the UART interrupt
is properly level-triggered, and the worst thing that happens when you
attempt to service an interrupt that isn't yours is that it stays on,
then you get a soft lockup with two or three recursive __irq_svc hits
in the backtrace.  If you're not lucky you do a fandango on core.

The interrupt would need to be masked for the entire duration of the
outer loop that calls serial8250_init() or the equivalent for all
platform devices that share the IRQ.

But its context is not.  Shared IRQ lines are a _problem_.  You cannot
safely enable an IRQ until all devices that share it have had their
ISRs installed, unless you can absolutely guarantee at a hardware
level that the unitialized ones cannot assert the IRQ line.  That does
not apply to any device that might have been touched by the bootloader
or the early init code, especially a UART.
