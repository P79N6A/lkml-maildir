I don't think so.
At this point we are largely counting the number of online cpus
(in pidx (pool index) - this is returned). The two-way mapping
to_pool and pool_to provides a mapping between the possible-sparse cpu
list and a dense list of pool indexes.
If further cpus come on line they will be automatically included in
pool-0. (as to_pool[n] will still be zero).
Does that make it at all clearer?
Thanks,
