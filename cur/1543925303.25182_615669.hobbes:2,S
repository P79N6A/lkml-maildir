Well, mounting shares from untrusted server is quite uncommon, still
buffer overrun shall be considered a serious issue, imho. If the buffer
was on the stack, that would be directly exploitable.

That is mostly a matter of taste. SendReceive takes buffer pointer and
SendReceive2 takes kvec  - I'd rather prefer to stay with  the same
function used for both small and large buffers, using two different
functions just because 2 different buffer sizes are passed around is
ugly, imho, nonorthogonal at least.  I guess that initial intention was
to use SendReceive2 in places where kvec is really needed. Also these
functions are almost identical, maybe SendReceive should wrap
SendReceive2 preparing kvec with a buffer pointer passed to it?
Obviously it is up to you, as a maintainer. I'd prefer adding a small
header to each buffer with the buffer size and perhaps a type, or even a
destructor function pointer. Simple macros could be used to obtain
buffer size, given the buffer body pointer, or to dispose the buffer.
That would save from checking the buffer type all over the code
explicitly, or even worse, make strange assumptions about the type of
buffer being passed - as we can see this is error-prone. That for a
little cost of a few additional bytes per buffer.
