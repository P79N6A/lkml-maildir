Here are the PDA patches again.  I changed the first patch so that the PDA is cacheline
aligned.  I dropped the cpunumber patch for now, and added conversions of the TLB state
and IRQ stats to match the 32-bit code.  Stats for defconfig:
  text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
7033649 1754476  758508 9546633  91ab89 vmlinux.before
7029643 1754716  758508 9542867  919cd3 vmlinux.after
Patches are against 2.6.28.
