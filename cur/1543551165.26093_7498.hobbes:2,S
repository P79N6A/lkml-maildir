Note that some of them are not very good no-ops. At least at some point
the "long" no-op was
	lea 0x00000000(%esi),%esi
and you could cause AGI stalls and non-pairing with two of them in a row -
making the long no-op sequence potentially quite slow. The one-byte no-op
is recognized by the CPU as being a no-op (even though technically it
originally was a "xchg ax,ax" instruction decoding-wise - it doesn't
actually get executed as that in any modern CPU and thus avoids all the
dependencies implied in the traditional decode).
It may be that the special "lea" no-op is also recognized as such in newer
CPU's, but it wasn't in the early ones.
