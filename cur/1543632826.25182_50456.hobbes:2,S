  Hi,
      I am not able to compile 2.4 series kernels after
  linux-2.4.19-pre1 and I don't understand how others can !
  Consider the "struct request_queue" definition in blkdev.h
  In the 2.4.19-pre1 version, the last few lines read:
        /*
         * Tasks wait here for free read and write requests
         */
        wait_queue_head_t       wait_for_requests[2];
  };
  and for later versions this is changed to:
        /*
         * Tasks wait here for free request
         */
        wait_queue_head_t       wait_for_request;
  };
  yet drivers/block/ll_rw_blk.c still makes references to
  wait_for_requests[?]  in the void blk_init_free_list()
  and blkdev_release_request() functions and elsewhere.
  Roger
