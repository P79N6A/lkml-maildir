Yes. On improperly configured computer (i.e. without gpm -R), you
should run without mouse support. Tell your users to run gpm -R. Mouse
support from XFree should be removed...

Look at vojtech's input patches.

This is how it is going to be done in future. If you want to help with
development of linux-input, you'll be welcome.

I know gpm is big hack. But it is better than doing protocol decoding
yourself.

They do not want "real scan code"s, all they want is key codes, and
yes, it is valid. (Real scan code for arrow is something like E0 43 E0
21 E1 13, you don't want to decode that in your favourite game).

Medium raw mode will work just fine for you (and also for anyone else).

You can't even guarantee that service will be available on  any system
if it _is_ in kernel, so your argument is bogus. [Think old system,
think system with kernel de-bloated by hand.]

Yes it is about vojtech pavlik, I believe.
