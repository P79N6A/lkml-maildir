Subject:	ANN: cmpci 6.77 released
Hi,
I made changes based on the previous released (6.67), now the version is 6.77.
Major changes are described as follows:
1. I found that the legacy devices I/O ranges cannot be accessed on
 platforms other than X86, such as PowerPC and IA-64 systems.
 Now I only leave legacy devices enable selection on kernel config,
 user still need to set proper value for mpuio, fmio and joystick to
 use them, I think this matches other driver style.
 I also check the legacy device existance before enabling them, as
 there are chipset (i.e., Intel ICHx) support mpu401.
2. Fix the DUAL_DAC 4-channel PCM mode, now the 2 DACs play in
 synchronized way. Only user use 37 or earlier chip will feel difference.
3. Add AFMT_S16_BE format support so it can support more PowerPC
  platforms applications, too many APs insisted on using this format,
  although I report AFMT_S16_LE in GETFMT ioctl.
4. Fix AFMT_AC3 data sent on big-endian system, now MPlayer and Xine
   can send AC3 audio data correctly on Mac.
5. Fix CD/Line-in/AUX-in single channel mute bug.
The There are 3 patch files, which should be applied to the previous version
 (6.67) and the change-6.67-6.77 shows version change in detail.
Enjoy!
Sincerely,
ChenLi Tien
