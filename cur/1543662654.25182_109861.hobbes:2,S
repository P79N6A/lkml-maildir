Err, tell the whole story Jamie.  You are going down the path of trying
to make CVS work as much as possible like BitKeeper.  That's a perfectly
reasonable thing for you to do but we are in no way obligated to help you.
As for Alan, we aren't offering to special case him.  We would do what 
we have done with any and every other concerned company: we worked out
an agreement which works for both companies and move on.  I could really
care less that Red Hat ships CVS and bug fixes it.  Where I get unhappy 
is if Alan were using BK every day and walking over to the people working
on CVS and saying "you know, BK does this really cool thing, could you
do this?".
