I don't know exactly, I've only briefly glanced at the code which hints
at some kind of a "cookie" mechanism.
Until I (or someone else) can think up with a better solution, I've
bypassed the dircache code in my kernel; hooking readdir() directly into
SMB's FINDFIRST/FINDNEXT mechanism. A little bit slower, but safe.
