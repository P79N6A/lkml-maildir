        Maybe i`d better to post this problem to
  linux-ppp ML, but i`ve reported already it to PPP
maintainers about half year ago, thus i felt ok to post
here. And so the problem:
     I`m unable sometimes to get files thru HTTP, and
the way its happening is very strange for me:
     it looks like the packets with file are on place,
     but kernel rejects `em, fact of what is reflected
     in significant growth of errors of PPP inteface
    showed by ifconfig. I checked what error count
    increase is contemporary with flashing lights on
    my Sportster 14400 Vi. But thats half of the
problem, because this afaik is not a 100% error. It
    wouldn`t have look that strange for me, if i had
    that with different files. BUT for ex. i cant get
"
http://www.mail-archive.com/linux-kernel
%40vger.kernel.org/msg12187.html", and that happens with about 20% of
small files i retrieve thu web... =(. That problem
afaik doesnt extend to large files (e.g >10k)
        Usually receive stalls on 1 or 2 kbytes.
      Having 2.4.0-test9/pppd 2.4.0-release.
            Encountering that ONLY on 
       2.4.0-testXX series, NOT in 2.2.XX (for ex.
     2.2.17 goes well with that).
     Again, 2.4.N with n<~7 were absolutely unworkable,
    e.g. the procent of "rejected" small files lied
     around 80%.
Sorry for ugly english/stupidness, i`m foreign
                                 non-kernelhacker.
