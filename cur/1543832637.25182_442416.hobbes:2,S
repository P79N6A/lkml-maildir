So far, so good.

tee() can still return 0 without SPLICE_F_NONBLOCK being set, if the
pipes are changed in between the _prep calls and link_pipe(). There's
really nothing we can do about that. There's no EOF condition for
link_pipe(), as it purely operates on pipes. A 0 return means that we
had no data to splice and could not wait for data, either because it
would be a locking violation or because it simply doesn't make sense to
wait (eg no writers attached to the pipe). It will only return EAGAIN
for a non-blocking tee() now though.

Same holds true for splice. We can still return 0 even for a blocking
splice if there's no data to splice from the pipe and no writers
attached. This is identical to how pipes behave.

Correct.

Good, it should be fixed with the blocking removal from link_pipe().

That is pretty odd. Any chance you can do a quick sysrq-t and see where
find/ktee/wc is stuck when this happens? You should not be seeing that,
naturally, I'll see if I can reproduce that here. How much data does
find . return in your example?
