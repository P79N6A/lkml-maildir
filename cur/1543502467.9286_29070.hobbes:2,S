This depends on your architecture.  Intel platforms are fully DMA coherent; 
the chipset snoops on DMA cycles and flushes the cache as required to maintain 
a consistent view.  On some other machines this is not the case and you must 
deal with the caches by hand (see, for example, 
include/asm-arm/proc-armv/io.h).
