Heh.. ten days ago, I instrumented the halt/poweroff functions in the kernel,
with addtional step-by-step printk's to help figure out where it hangs.
But of course, just having the printk's there changes the timing enough
that the race which would hang it, now never happens.
Heh.. I wonder if a patch full of printk's would ever make it past Linus here.  :)
