I am in the same boat as Tester.  My laptop using kernels 2.4.8, 2.4.9, 
and a few -ac patches locks every single time when yenta_socket loads.  
Everything besides yenta_socket seems to work fine (so far).  I 
generally compile APM as a module and I am not loading it on boot, so 
there are few modules loading on a raw boot.  Perhaps I am required to 
use some sort of PNP setup with 2.4.x?  My stupid bios has absolutely 
no settings regarding pcmcia/pccard.  The only half-relevant option is 
the "PNP OS Installed?  Y/N".  Using 2.2.19pre17 (stock Debian Potato 
kernel) works generally fine with i82365/pcnet_cs loaded.
If anyone needs more h/w info or would like me to test patches I'd be 
more than happy to help.
