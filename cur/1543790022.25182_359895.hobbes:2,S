This is a typical example of using a hammer to crack a nut aka
modifying the kernel before giving up on userspace.
Several ways of looking up a solution:
    * google
    * man -k memory
Leading to:
* free(1):
    ``free  displays the total amount of free and used physical and swap''
* Or /proc/meminfo (both the same thing) - which you can trivially
parse using sed:
cat /proc/meminfo | sed -n -e "s/^MemTotal:[ ]*\([0-9]*\) kB\$/\1/p"
