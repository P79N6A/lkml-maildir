Hi,
I have some more info - hope it is useful. My current way to induce the
oops is to fire up netscape and read my JDK documentation which is on
the NTFS partition for a bit, whilst running updatedb in the background.
I added a bit of debug in and got this:
kernel: root==NULL!! length=1024, walk->dir->vol=c000e044, walk->dir=c271d1a4, walk=c2829f28
kernel: ntfs_read_attr called with buf=c2829ee4, buf->param=00000000
kernel: Ack, r/w attr about to put with dest=c2829ee4, dest->size=56, dest->param=00000000, l=56
kernel: Ick, ntfs_put called with dest->param NULL; dest=c2829ee4, src=c196e860, n=56
kernel: memcpy called with null dest; src=c196e860, n=56
kernel: Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 00000000
The problem is in ntfs_getdir:
int ntfs_getdir(ntfs_iterate_s* walk)
{
	int length=walk->dir->vol->mft_recordsize;
	int retval,error;
	/* start at the index root.*/
	char *root=ntfs_malloc(length);
	ntfs_io io;
	if( !root ) {
		printk( KERN_ERR "root==NULL!! length=%lu, walk->dir->vol=%p,"
		" walk->dir=%p, walk=%p\n", length, walk->dir->vol, walk->dir, walk );
	}
	io.fn_put=ntfs_put;
	io.param=root;
	io.size=length;
	error=ntfs_read_attr(walk->dir,walk->dir->vol->at_index_root,
			     I30,0,&io);
	if(error)
As you can see, ntfs_malloc seems to be returning null, even though it should
only be trying to allocate 1024 bytes.. I'd thought maybe it was getting a
nonsensically large value passed in there, but it seems not. Oh well, I'll
carry on looking around..
Cheers,
Steve
