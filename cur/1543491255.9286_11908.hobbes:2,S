On 28 Mar, Nomad the Wanderer spewed forth:
:: 
::   I compiled and installed 2.2.4 and now I can't see my IDE cdrom.
:: It detects it at boot time, but when I go to mount anything:
:: 
:: {0}:dogbert:/home/nomad>mount /cdrom
:: mount: the kernel does not recognize /dev/hda as a block device
::        (maybe `insmod driver'?)
:: 
:: /dev/hda is my cdrom as I'm all SCSI.
:: 
:: {0}:dogbert:/home/nomad>cat /proc/devices 
:: Character devices:
::   1 mem
::   2 pty
::   3 ttyp
::   4 ttyS
::   5 cua
::   7 vcs
::  10 misc
::  14 OSS
::  21 sg
:: 119 vmnet
:: 128 ptm

Well, from your own block device listing, you have fd (floppy), sd
(scsi), and sr (scsi).
Mine is the same:
Block devices:
  1 ramdisk
  2 fd
  8 sd
 11 sr
However, my CD is on /dev/scd0.  /dev/hd* are h(ard) d(isks) on and IDE
port (which would also include IDE CD's).  So, try /dev/scd* or
/dev/sr*, starting with 0 as the first cdrom.  Also, have a look at
/usr/src/Documentation/devices.txt to find the following, and more,
useful information:
    block       SCSI CD-ROM devices
                  0 = /dev/sr0          First SCSI CD-ROM
                  1 = /dev/sr1          Second SCSI CD-ROM
                      ...
                The prefix /dev/scd instead of /dev/sr has been used
                as well, and might make more sense.
