Sample testing targets, to see if you made any typing errors.
  make vmlinux
  make arch/i386/boot/bzImage
  make drivers/acpi (non-recursive)
  make drivers/acpi-r (recursive)
Do it with NO_MAKEFILE_GEN=1 for much, much! faster builds.  But you
should really do a clean make installable (which will do modules as
well) before make install.

You mixed the old kbuild 2.4 make *config with a kbuild 2.5 build.
Don't do that.
One of the downsides of coexistence, users can get it wrong.
make -f Makefile-2.5 menuconfig installable
