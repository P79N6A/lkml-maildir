So what you want to do is get notification of new file creations ?

Its also useless because I can switch paths around under your analyser
and fool you into missing things. Wrappers dont work, its also why snare
is so limited in value for example.
There are interfaces for monitoring directories for new file creations -
using things like dnotify from user space. They may be sufficient, but
if not the right question is "how do we make a real solution work" not
how do we hack half working tricks into syscall entry points.

In general there isnt, nor should there need to be.
