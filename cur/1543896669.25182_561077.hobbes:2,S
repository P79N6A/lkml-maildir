Christoph,
Thanks for taking the time to look at my patches!

Honestly, I highly doubted that this would make it up to Linus's tree.
My aim was to get this into -mm, and perhaps even turn on the
tasklets-as-workqueues as default.
The objective of these patches was more of a proof-of-concept, showing
that the tasklets are indeed obsolete today.  By putting this patch set
into -mm, we can get a good idea of the regressions that this conversion
would cause, hopefully before we did the real change of converting a
driver's tasklet into a work queue.
I only have a limited amount of hardware to test on. I believe this is a
good candidate as a permanent resident into -mm and can display the
effects of using work queues instead of tasklets in a wider arena.
This patch is too much of a kludge to put into Linus's tree, and if it
were in that tree, it would probably cause laziness and make it even
less likely that driver authors would get rid of their tasklets.  But I
argue it is perfect for the -mm tree, because it allows users to easily
(with a config option) turn it on and off and run benchmarks to see its
effect.
