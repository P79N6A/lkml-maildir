And we won't know if drivers are OK until we remove the freezer,
catch-22.
So I think we need to disable the freezer at least in -mm and/or
optionally in -linus.
I applied Matthew's patch, and suspend did in fact stop working
(thinkpad t60), but there was nothing catastrophic.  Here's the dmesg
if somebody is interested:
