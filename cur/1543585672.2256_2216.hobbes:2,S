No, you would continue using the file descriptors which are already
open, i.e. on /dev/console on the old root.

To make sure the root of the current process is indeed changed.
pivot_root currently forces a chroot on all processes (except the
ones that have explicitly moved out of /) in order to move all the
kernel threads too, but this is not a nice solution. Once a better
solution is implemented for the kernel threads, we might drop the
forced chroot, and then the explicit chroot here becomes important.

You can run them later, e.g. /etc/rc.d/rc.local
Or, if you needs the space immediately,  make "what-follows" a
script than first frees them, and then exec's init.
