That is (presumably) true today, but is in fact a redefinition of what
ZONE_DMA historically was for.
Also there is the problem that some drivers use ZONE_DMA allocations
because their device can only generate addresses below some limit, but
on a platform with an IOMMU there is in fact no restriction on what
memory the device can access.
