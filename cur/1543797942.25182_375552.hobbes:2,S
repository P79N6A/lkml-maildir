Done, I think. It's not always 100% obvious.

Done.

Why not? I want to make them different types so that you can't use the wrong
operators by accident or mix them.

Well, I could fold this into each asm/semaphore.h.

You're right.

But that's a poor name: it turns it from a question into a statement:-(

No... down_trylock().

down_trylock() again.

Yes.

You're probably right.

Hmmm... If you've only got two states available to you and/or you can only
exchange states, then there's a limit to what you can actually do. You can lose
the spinlock in the up() fastpath if you're willing to forgo fairness or resort
to waking up processes superfluously.
Ingo and Nick have a point about using CMPXCHG or equivalent if it's
available. This lets you modify the state you have, rather than swapping it for
a whole new state; in which case the state can be annotated to indicate that
there is waking up to be done, thus permitting the fast path to be much
faster. But this can only be done in the case where the state may be modified.
As I tried to make clear: this is the simplest I could come up with, but I have
made provision for overriding it with something better if that's possible.
