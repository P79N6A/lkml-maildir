I don't remember exactly where or when I read it - either linux-raid
or linux-kernel.  It was asserted by Stephen Tweedie.
The problem is that ext3 is very careful about when it writes buffer
to disk : it won't release a buffer until the relevant journal entry
is committed.
However when a RAID rebuild happens, every block on the array is read
into the buffer cache (if it isn't already there) and then written
back out again.  This defeats the control that ext3 tries to maintain
on the buffer cache.
I don't know exactly what large-scale effects this might have.  It
could be simply that a crash at the wrong time could leave the
filesystem corrupted.  But I heard of one person who claimed to get
filesystem corruption after using reiserfs over RAID1 in 2.2, so maybe
it's worse than that.
If you really need to know, I suggest you ask on ext3-users.
