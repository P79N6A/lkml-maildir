Not _another_ list: the more lists we have, the bigger the chance that
we have performance people who aren't talking to each other!  I've set
reply-to: to that list.  It's a majordomo list: run
	echo subscribe linux-perf | mail majordomo@www-klinik.uni-mainz.de
to subscribe.
Anyway, Rik now has a CVS repository set up now on nl.linux.org for
documentation, and I'm collecting links and patches to index the current
works-in-progress.  Any submissions will be gratefully accepted.
Cheers,
 Stephen
