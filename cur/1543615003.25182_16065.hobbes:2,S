The problem is the driver you're using on top of usb-ohci,
seemingly whatever talks to that ADSL modem.  It might
be fixed in a more recent kernel, I wouldn't know.

As it says in the comment on line 884, the problem is likely
(all but certainly) that "some interface's driver has a refcount
bug".  Specifically, the OHCI driver is being told the device
has gone away.  Because it's in_interrupt(), that's a lie ...
only khubd is allowed to declare that, and of course that can't
ever say that in_interrupt().
