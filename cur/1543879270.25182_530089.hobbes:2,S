Your profiles are name based. That means the same profile in a different
namespace does different things. It would be a very odd case where it
mattered but surely the parent ptrace child rule should also require that
the parent and child are in the same namespace when using apparmor name
based security.

Pointless function should go away.

The usual file permission security override is DAC not ADMIN. What is the
logic of this choice.

More pointless functions to delete.
