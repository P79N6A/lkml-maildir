Perhaps ... perhaps not.
Just as the knobs "only reclaim pagecache" and "reclaim vfs caches
harder" had too big a scope (system-wide), using fadvise might have too
small a scope (currently cached pages of current task only).
If his background daemon is some shell script, say, that uses 'cat' to
generate the i/o to the other spindle, then he probably wants to be
marking that daemon job "don't let this entire job eat my pagecache",
not rebuilding a hacked up cat command with added POSIX_FADV_DONTNEED
calls every megabyte.
CKRM to the rescue ... ??
