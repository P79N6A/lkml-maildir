As was mentioned, but not discussed, in the /proc/<pid>/rlimit thread,
it is not difficult to envision conditions where setrlimit() on another
process could make exploiting an application bug much easier, by, e.g.,
setting number of open files ridiculously low.  So IMHO, it ought require
privileges similar to ptrace() to change some, if not all, of the rlimits.
