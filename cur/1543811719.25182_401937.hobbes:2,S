Hi Alan,
the pata_pdc2027x driver works flawlessly AFAICT - the only weird thing about it would
be some duplicated init messages in dmesg:

It appears to me that some part of drive detection is done twice - at
least the output is generated redundantly. If this is a bug and not a
feature, maybe one issue of the output could be trimmed in the end.
There have been rumours about some Promise controller having trouble
with UDMA6 and the Linux drivers, but I am running this configuration
for quite some time now and never had the slightest problem.
Thanks, everyone, for the good stuff : )
