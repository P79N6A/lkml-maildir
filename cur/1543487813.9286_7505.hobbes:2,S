<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Anyway, think it would be nice to have an interface 
to the make= line inside of config and menuconfig.&nbsp; Maybe even have it 
default to whatever is approriate for memory size you have.&nbsp; So you can 
either access that right from the config program or have it default to a more 
appropriate number.&nbsp; So people with enough memory don't have to keep going 
into makefile and change it for each kernel.&nbsp; Just my two 
cents.</FONT></DIV>
