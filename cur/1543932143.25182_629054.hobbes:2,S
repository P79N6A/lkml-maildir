As an FYI: I've had a lot of problems with the big prepackaged drives
in the last 6 months even from Windows, so I would not be too quick to
blame Linux.
ie.
I bought several 500GB / 1000GB Buffalo Drives last month with plans
to use them from Windows via USB.
I attempted to do a lot of heavy file copying to/from them.  I was
getting a bunch of "Delayed Write Failures",
I finally gave up.
The 500GB drives had a single hard drive internally, so I opened the
case, removed the drive and connected them via standalone external
carriers I had around.  In that mode the drives worked fine (from
Windows).  I've used both standalone eSata external carriers and
standalone USB external carriers with these same physical drives with
no issues.
My conclusion is that the electronics in the prepackaged external
units is just not up to the job if your doing heavy i/o.
