Legato Networker (now belongs to EMC) is using the same enumeration scheme to 
access media changer (but not the drivers themselves). In this case I can 
speak for Solaris, Windows and Linux. I must admit I would have preferred to 
use something like /dev/sgen on Solaris because even Networker documentation 
warns that adapter number that is shown by configuration bears no relation to 
adapter instance numbers as can be seen by user. So almost the only way to 
make sure you are speaking to correct physical device is to use inquire 
command and check device type and may be even serial number. The only 
consolation is that you usually do not have dozens of media changers 
connected ;)
