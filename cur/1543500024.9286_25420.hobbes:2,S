Andrea,
I'm tempted to delete that assertion since it wasn't in 2.3.6.
Since current is #define'd as returning the current "task_struct",
I'm assuming that this is to prevent processes from creating pages
that it doesn't own.
The possible implication of this assertion failing is that there
is a security problem with page creation in the kernel.
"page->owner" is apparently debug code that plays with setting
the particular uid of the page. 
It could also mean that the "struct page" isn't locked correctly.
I don't know.
The relevant files after "egrep -rn owners ." are:
./include/linux/mm.h:136:       int owner; /* temporary debugging check */
./include/linux/mm.h:178:       if (page->owner) PAGE_BUG(page); \
./include/linux/mm.h:179:       page->owner = (int)current; } while (0)
./include/linux/mm.h:181:                               if (!_ret) page->owner = (int)current; _ret; })
./include/linux/mm.h:183:                                       if (page->owner != (int)current) { \
./include/linux/mm.h:184:BUG(); } page->owner = 0; \
./mm/filemap.c:484:     page->owner = (int)current;     /* REMOVEME */
./mm/filemap.c:1961:                    if (page->owner != (int)current) {
./fs/nfs/read.c:154:    page->owner = (int)current; // HACK, FIXME, will go away.
./fs/buffer.c:1271:     if (page->owner != -1)
./fs/buffer.c:1273:     page->owner = (int)current;
./fs/buffer.c:1290:     if (page->owner != (int)current)
./fs/buffer.c:1654:     page->owner = -1;
./fs/buffer.c:1695:                     page->owner = (int)current;
./fs/buffer.c:1727:     page->owner = -1;
./fs/buffer.c:1781:             page->owner = (int)current;
