The memset looks wrong:
-       memset(buf, 0, sizeof (buf));
+       if ((buf = (u_char *) kmalloc(2060, GFP_KERNEL)) == NULL)
+               return -ENOMEM;
+
+       memset(buf, 0, sizeof(buf));
                       ^^^^^^^^^^^
        init_cdrom_command(&cgc, buf, sizeof(buf));
I doubt you want to initialize the first 4 bytes...
