Good lord, and you would dream this up and use it before just using the
same coding style as the rest of us? :)
Maybe I am biased because I find CodingStyle beautiful, but I can't
understand why it is so hard to just play nicely with the rest of us.  I
diffed a patch for Alan against mtrr.c a week or so back to fix some
compile bug, and I was confused doing a _two line_ diff.
