you mean, Linux 2.2.5 and 6.0 of your distribution (redhat, SuSE,
whatever)? "Linux 6.0" won't exist for a couple more years :)

That might be a distribution problem. Check if your hard drive is full up
or the /tmp directory contains LOTS of files, if so, remove them to free up
space.
Perhaps you need to restart the Font Server (/etc/init.d/xfs, perhaps
/etc/rc.d or something).

That very much looks like the Font libraries / Font server couldn't be
loaded. I had the problem when starting Mandrake 6.0 (~ Redhat) on a
full-up hard disk.

  If a packet hits a pocket on a socket on a port,
    And the bus is interrupted as a very last resort,
      And the address of the memory makes your floppy disk abort,
        Then the socket packet pocket has an error to report!
