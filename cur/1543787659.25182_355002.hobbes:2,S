Drat. No. It is missing the actual diff ;)
The cause is that the patch was corrupted, but in a way that git-apply 
didn't notice. The diff looked like this:
	diff --git a/arch/arm/mach-ixp2000/core.c b/arch/arm/mach-ixp2000/core.c
	--- a/arch/arm/mach-ixp2000/core.c
	+++ b/arch/arm/mach-ixp2000/core.c
	 static struct resource ixp2000_uart_resource = {
	...
and it's actually missing the line numbers (and an empty line). Which ends 
up meaning that it's interpreted as an empty patch with just garbage 
following, so I ended up committing an empty change.
I've pushed out the real patch.
Thanks for noticing. I'll make "git-apply" flag empty patches as errors.
