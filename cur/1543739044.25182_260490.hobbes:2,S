This does not happen on my laptop.
Testing also 2.6.9-rc4-mm1-U0, but a slightly custom jack 0.99.5 (cvs)
patched with "my" max_delayed_usecs suite.
And jackd it's pumping while I'm writing this lines: jackd -R -d alsa,
against bundled crapsound (ali5451).
My laptop is a P4 2.53Ghz, running on Mandrake 10.1c (gcc 3.4.1, glibc
2.3.3 NPTL).
Take care.
