Uh, sure.  This is the test I prefer:
	if( (unsigned long)tv->usec > USEC_PER_SEC)
		return EINVAL;
Note that the unsigned picks up the negative value as well as the > 
(and it does it in only one machine code test/jmp :)
This change should go in do_sys_settimeofday() in kernel/time.c.  It 
will fix both settimeofday and clock_settime(CLOCK_REALTIME,...  And 
also fixes it in all archs.
