Indeed I already had done that UDP and TCP patch before I posted this
thread. I think that is still not the way... I just tested the system using
the generic patch and the results are;
- I send a packet with wrong checksum to a closed UDP port, the kernel
replies it (It would seem that UDP checksum is gone but no)
- I send a packet with wrong checksum to a closed TCP port, the kernel drops
it (TCP will not budge)
- I send a packet with wrong checksum to an open UDP port, the kernel drops
it. (UDP checksum is still in effect somehow)
- I send an snmpget request to my client, intercept the packet, re-send it
to the linux machine which is pathced, snmpget gets the correct data
- I send an snmpget request to my client, intercept the packet, put arbitary
(wrong) checksum in it, re-send it to the linux machine which is patched,
snmpget does not even see the data coming in. (Still dropped by kernel)
Perhaps I should start another thread with another subject instead of
blindly trying to get rid of checksum?

Please try Kalin's suggestion, instead of my patch.  It's more generic,
plus my 'patch' didn't handle UDP.
