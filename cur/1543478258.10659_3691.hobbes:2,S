Subject: Security hole in console driver?

I just closed down an X session on tty9 that was started from
tty6.  After X closed down, I switched back to tty9 and what I
found was the output of some commands I typed 2 days ago on tty2.
Even if I were logged out on all consoles on my machine, someone
walking by could ALT-Fkey to tty9 and see private information.
It might also be possible for them to gain more information
through scrollback, etc...
I don't know how much of a security concern this is, but I've
seen stuff on tty9 after running X several times and had no idea
what it was.  Now I know that somehow, the contents of another
tty are ending up on that tty.
Suggestions/comments?
