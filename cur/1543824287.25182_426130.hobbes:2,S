Why disable this printk_ratelimit?  Does this expose us to a Denial of
Service attack from someone forcing multiple oom-kills in a small
cpuset, generating much kernel printk output?

This comment is slightly stale.  Not only does oom_alloc() try one
more allocation, it also actually does invoke the OOM killer.
How about the comment:
   /* Serialize oom killing, while trying to allocate a page */
Or some such ..
