The oops report is incomplete: there should be some more
lines with the stack dump and the call chain.
Note that sometimes klogd is unable to write the
data to the harddisk before Linux crashes.

1) upgrade to a newer kernel, perhaps the problem
is already solved. DO NOT USE 2.2.8.
If you want to find the problem:
1) Do you have a second computer nearby?
Use a null modem cable and enable the serial console.
You can dump the oops report to the other computer,
the complete report should be stored.

Yes you can use even NT to dump the oops.
2) If you are a developer and want to debug it yourself,
then there are (AFAIK) 3 kernel debuggers.
- remote GDB, you need 2 computers and a serial connection.
www.gcom.com
- a kernel debugger from SGI (www.linux.sgi.com)
You need only 1 computer, the complete debugger runs in kernel
mode.
- the ikd kernel debugger.
this is a combined user mode & kernel mode debugger:
the kernel is interrupted, and switchted back into
user mode. I think you'll have problems
if you try to single step interrupts etc.
(I never used this debugger,
