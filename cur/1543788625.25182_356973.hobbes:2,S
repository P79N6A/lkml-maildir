Hence a new field in the termios structure?
There was a discussion about this back in 2000:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?t=96514848800003&r=1&w=2
and more precisely a remind of SVR4's termiox structure with an added
x_hflag:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=96523146720678&w=2
I'm not sure about how we'd want to implement that. The SVR4 approach
(orthogonal input/output flow control selection) doesn't seem right to
me: there are really peculiar flow controls that involve both ways. A
mere enumeration of possible methods might be better.

Samuel
