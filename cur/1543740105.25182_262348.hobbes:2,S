Yeah, one of the driving forces behind going to 4K task stacks is that 
you significantly reduce the amount of kernel memory reserved for user 
processes.  But then, there came the requirement to keep around a 
handful of irq stacks which doesn't hurt.
Given the finite and small number of IRQ stacks required, I see no 
reason not to make them 8K, other than for elegance sake.  You're not 
really wasting much memory by giving IRQ's 8k stacks.
Yes, I know, it does feel icky, though.  :)
