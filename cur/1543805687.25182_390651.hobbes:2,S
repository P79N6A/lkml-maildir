Maybe the kernel device driver doesn't work as expected compared to
the PXE driver. I've heard that the other way around is more likely
though. =) Or maybe the PXE driver does half duplex communication only
but the Linux driver is more advanced and supports full duplex, which
fails for some reason.
Check the duplex, try using a good old hub to force half duplex communication.
Or maybe it is an issue with your DHCP server?

I'm netbooting 2.6.15 (ip=on kernel command line) and it works fine for me.
