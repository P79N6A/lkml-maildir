The getattr problem was that after the mount smbfs isn't ready to do 
anything until it gets a connection from smbmount. Filling smp_ops_null 
would give the user an error on whatever it is that it does immediately 
after mounting.
smp_ops_null should really make all functions block and wait for the
connection to be created and given to us from smbmount. That would make it
behave more like smbfs in 2.4 does.
I am thinking of something like this for each entry in smp_ops_null.
int whatever_it_is_that_I_am(args)
{
	timeleft = wait_event_interruptible_timeout(...)
	if (!timeleft || signal_pending(current))
		return -EIO;
	if (!server->ops->whatever_it_is_that_I_am)
		return -EIO;
	return server->ops->whatever_it_is_that_I_am(args)
}
I know bugme has bug1671 with a similar oops. If no one else does, I'll
make a patch for Adam and #1671 to test.
I have not been able to reproduce this before, but if it is that readdir 
is used before it is ready then some extra delays in smbmount might help.
