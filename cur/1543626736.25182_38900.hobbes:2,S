I suspect that the problem is that BK won't let you accept a patch unless
the receiving repository has the parent of the patch.  In other words,
this won't work:
	bk clone bk://linux.bkbits.net/linux-2.5
	<make some changes>
	bk commit (or bk citool)	# creates changeset 1.800
	<make some changes>
	bk commit (or bk citool)	# creates changeset 1.801
	# Now you want to send the second patch to Linus so you do a:
	bk send -r+ - | mail linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
That will fail when Linus tries to accept the patch, because he doesn't
have your 1.800.
The easiest thing is to do what he suggests:

and if you want to go the "tree for pulling", you can either point him at
a BK url you maintain, or you are welcome to go grab resierfs.bkbits.net
and stash it there.  See 
http://www.bitkeeper.com/Hosted.html
 for information
on how to set up a project here.
At some point, we'll package up the whole bkbits.net infrastructure as an
installable RPM (not the project data, the infrastructure), and you'll be
able to do this at resierfs.bkbits.kernel.org or something like that, but
right now we're just too overworked to do so.
