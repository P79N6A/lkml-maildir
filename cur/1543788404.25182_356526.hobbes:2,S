(Not a kernel question - next time, ask on one of the Fedora lists at redhat.com)
Getting FC3 to run on on a romfs based system will be a challenge.  In any
case, romfs has approximately zero to do with your problem.
What you've almost certainly done is forgotten to do a proper 'mkinitrd' -
FC3 and later need an initrd to get going in most cases.  (Specifically,
your initrd image needs to have a /dev/console entry in the /dev on the
initrd filesystem, and you don't have one).
