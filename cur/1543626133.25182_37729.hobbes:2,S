Hi all!
There is a machine which display I want to keep showin' on all the time.
It is the same when on X or console, the screen goes blank in around 20
minutes.
kernel 2.4.10-2.4.18, debian woody, with all powermanagement turned off
and not compiled in the kernel nor module, no apmd, acpid running, apm is
turned off in the bios, happens with both vesafb and plain vga text
console, too.
X is configured no to use DPMS, all blank params eq 0
It happens on several machines, any idea?
thanks!
