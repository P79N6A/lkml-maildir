OK, this should make sure that dirty data is flushed as fast as the
disks can handle, but is there anything that makes sure there will be
enough dirty data to flush for each disk?
Assume there are two processes writing one file each to two different
block devices. To be able to dirty more data a process will have to
allocate a page, and a page becomes available whenever one of the
disks finishes an I/O operation. If both processes have a 50/50 chance
to get the freed page, they will dirty data equally fast once steady
state has been reached, even if the block devices have very different
write bandwidths.
