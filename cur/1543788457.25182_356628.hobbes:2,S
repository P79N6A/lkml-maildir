I have been looking over CAN-2005-3109, better known as
the hfs, hfsplus leak and oops, and I am wondering if the 
problem is present in 2.4
I took a look at making a backport, and it seems that
some of the problems are there, but without a deeper inspection
of the code its difficult to tell if the problems manifest or not.
For reference, here is the 2.6 variant of the change:
http://www.kernel.org/git/gitweb.cgi?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=945b092011c6af71a0107be96e119c8c08776f3f
I can futher my backport effort and post it for inspection if need be.
