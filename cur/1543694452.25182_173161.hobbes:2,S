I'm pretty sure not. Linux provides:
per-process start time
current time
per-process total (lifetime) CPU usage
units of time measurement (awkwardly)
boot time

life of the process. This does not meet the

What we do for load average is about right,
except that per-process values can't all get
updated at the same time. So the algorithm
needs to be adjusted a bit to allow for that
