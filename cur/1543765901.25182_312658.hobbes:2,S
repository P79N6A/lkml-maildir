Hello!
When I wrote schwanz3(*) for fun, I noticed /proc/cpuinfo
varies very much on different architectures.
Is it possible to make it look more identical (as far as the different
archs allow it)?
So that one at least can count the cpus on every system the same way.
If so, who would the one I should contact and who would accept / verify
a patch doing that?
Greetings,
Nico
