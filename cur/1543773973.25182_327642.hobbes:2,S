The system is working fine, stable, without errors. I was just
courious about this kernel msg flood.

Okay. The other device at 03:09.0 is a:
Multimedia audio controller: Creative Labs SB Live! EMU10k1 (rev 08)
| The spurious 8259A interrupt message *may* be viewed as a problem.
I'm getting this sh*t from 2.4.18 or so... I think its another story.
Anyway, I love this 2120S, boots quite slooowly, but works fine and
stable.
Ah, the chip is *very* *very* *very* hot on the card, is that normal?
