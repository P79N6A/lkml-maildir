Doug, I noted a similar bug back about 2.5.38, which went away if I boot
the SMP kernel on uni with "nosmp" in the boot parameters. If you are
curious I'd love to know if that's related, and I'm sure someone looking
at the problem would like to know as well.
The 2.4 kernels seem fine in that regard, I did a test the hard way, when
I got a batch of Xeons with the lifespan of a mayfly. After one died and
the system was rebooted every one came up cleanly with only one CPU.
However, most of the SMP hardware was still there, and I boot "noapic"
because it seems to help uptime.
