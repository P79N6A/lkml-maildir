What's the benefit of doing so - and why has not it been done before?
I mean, I run a regular 2.6.18.6,
/sys/devices/system/clocksource/clocksource0/current_clocksource (is this
related?) shows "acpi_pm", but the IRQ0 counter increases at HZ. Maybe I
am confusing things, but why the need for PIT when clocksource is acpi_pm
anyway?
