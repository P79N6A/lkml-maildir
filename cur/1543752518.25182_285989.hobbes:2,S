OK, I reran with just 5 processes reniced from -10 to -5.  On my
system they were: events, khelper, kblockd, aio and reiserfs.  In
addition, I reniced loop0 from -20 to -5.
I made no changes to the kernel, yet.  It's still vanilla 2.6.10 with
realtime-lsm built-in.
A whole bunch of jackd, sh and jack_test3_client processes are ran at
nice -20.
It didn't make any significant difference...

*********************************************
One major problem: this `nice --20' hack affects every thread, not
just the critical realtime ones.  That's not what we want.  Audio
applications make very conscious choices which threads run with high
priority and which do not.
That JACK scheduling test doesn't have any graphical component, so it
cannot detect the problems of audio applications with GTK or Qt
threads running at nice -20 which will interfere with their own signal
processing loop.  I expect that to cause a horrible mess.
Plus, we maintain JACK for several platforms including GNU/Linux,
FreeBSD, and Mac OS X.  IRIX support is planned soon, possibly Solaris
some day.  I would really prefer for Linux to support genuine POSIX
realtime with SCHED_FIFO scheduling.  Since that is our primary
development platform, it makes our code a lot more portable.
And, this is not just about JACK.  We could change to call nice()
instead of pthread_setschedparam() on Linux, but that about all the
other audio applications?  I don't think this is a reasonable thing to
ask of people.  It would take a year just to get them all changed,
like herding cats.
This whole approach seems like a "dry well" to me.
Tomorrow, I'll try the test again after making a new kernel with
STARVATION_LIMIT set to zero.  
Anything else I should try?
