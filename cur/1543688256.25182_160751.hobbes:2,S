Alan, its not true.  Please check with ide-disk.c.
If hwif->addressing is 1 then probe_lba_addressing() wont set
drive->addressing to 1 and therefore you wont get LBA48
(both PIO and DMA) because of drive->addressing check
insided __ide_do_rw_disk().
Its not complete fix but it doesnt break anything and stops fs corruption.
