No, no.  It was Martin's fault: He used a NULL class to indicate that we
had no transport class.
The registration code in SCSI looks like:
	if (sdev->transport_classdev.class) {
		error = class_device_add(&sdev->transport_classdev);
i.e. only add the device if we actually have a transport class.  The
oops was caused because the unregister code was unconditional (i.e.
unregister a device we never registered in the first place).  The patch
(among other things) makes it conditional on the
sdev->transport_classdev.class like the registration.
