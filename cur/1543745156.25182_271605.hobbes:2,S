I haven't really looked into it, so I cannot make an informed decision.  
How big is the overhead? And what's the _point_, since we don't seem to 
need them normally, but the code is there for people who _do_ need them? 
I don't generally like two paths, but quite frankly, I consider the
non-compound case the regular case right now. How expensive does the
compound pages end up being? Is it just one more pointer chase on every
get_page/put_page, or what? Does anybody have numbers for before/after 
that are otherwise comparable?
