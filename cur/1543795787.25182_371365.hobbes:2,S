Well, as Pekka Enberg also pointed out, Documentation/CodingStyle says
that's not the prefered way. But, it's your code, so if you don't like
the cleanups don't apply them.
i still think the patch is a good idea and makes the file more readable though.

Same with this bit, IMHO a good idea, but I won't bother making a
patch if you don't want it.
