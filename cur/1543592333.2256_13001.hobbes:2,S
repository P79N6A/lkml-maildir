this is INCORRECT: we know there are specific problems with certain
VIA hardware, but there is most definitely *NO* problem with other 
VIA hardware, which is eminently suitable for servers, workstations
and cabbage dicing controllers.
afaik, there are absolutely zero problems reported with kt133-no-a
machines, for instance.  mine has certainly worked flawlessly for a 
long time, on most every 2.3/2.4 kernel over the past year+.
