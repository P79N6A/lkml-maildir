All kernel places that does a preemot_on have also to do the preempt_off
before returning to the lower layer so I think can consider the blah
statatic at such point.
Also it make no sense to use preempt_on from an irq and the only case I
can think of if is somebody does a copy_user in irq with a safe page
locked down (so he known we can't fault on in and he can't use memcpy for
sparc and others that have overlapping virtual addresses between user and
kernel) but that is bad design anyway (and it's safe w.r.t. preempt_* for
the above mentioned in the above paragraph).
So I don't think we need the non atomic incl/decl.
The compiler barrier() are necessary indeed.
