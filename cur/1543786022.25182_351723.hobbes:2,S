So it's OK to use the "...._to_cpup" macros with unaligned pointers?
I'm asking whether ...
  1) Passing le64_to_cpup an unaligned pointer is "OK" and within the
     intended use of the function.  I'm having trouble finding whether
     this is documented somewhere.
  2) These new changes to the sparc64 unaligned access fault handling
     will make it OK to leave the aoe driver the way it is in the
     mainline kernel.
