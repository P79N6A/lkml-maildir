Changes since 2.6.8.1-ck7
Due to time constraints, stability etc I am sticking to just performance 
patches and bugfixes from this release on. It is getting too hard to 
maintain the other patches and the bug reports that go with them and 
still develop my own patches. There seem to be _many_ people maintaining 
trees based on mine and I prefer they maintain the extra features. There

Added:
+cfq2 bugfixes
Numerous little additions from Jens Axboe to his CFQ I/O scheduler
+cbq-fixes.diff
Two memory leaks that caused instability in mainline with QoS enabled
Updated:
~from_2.6.8.1_to_staircase8.3
The staircase cpu scheduler has been updated to the latest code. The 
main change is much better cpu accounting separtely from jiffies for 
running tasks to improve fairness. This improves some hardware emulation 
(wine, zsnes, mame etc), some games, some audio software and some 
overall fairness issues.
Rolled up - these patches are rolled up versions of all the inbetween 
patches used in 2.6.8.1-ck7:
+1g_lowmem1_i386.diff
+akpm-latency-fix1.patch
+cdaudio_leakfix.patch
+cfq2-17092004.patch
Removed:
-cool-spinlocks-i386.diff
This has gone into mainline in a newer form so there is no point 
maintaining the older one.
-supermount-ng205.diff
I'm still maintaining this separately and it can be found in the split 
patches if you still wish to use it.
-fbsplash-0.9-r5-2.6.8-rc3.patch
Feature removed
-make-tree_lock-an-rwlock.patch
-invalidate_inodes-speedup.patch
