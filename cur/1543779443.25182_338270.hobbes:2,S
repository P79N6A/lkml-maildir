The I-cache might not be completely clean when executing the first
process since the kernel already ran code from the .init.text section
which is freed.
Anyway, the problem you are seeing, apart from the I-cache flushing,
looks to me like being caused by not flushing the D-cache on the CPU
that actually wrote the page (not the one handling the page
fault). That's why flushing immediately (not lazily) seems to work.
