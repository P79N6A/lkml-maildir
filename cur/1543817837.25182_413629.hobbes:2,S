Wow, thanks for the fast reply !
The backtrace is:
[<a00000010007fc50>] preempt_enable_no_resched+0xb0/0xe0
[<a000000100037510>] disabled_fph_fault+0x110/0x140
[<a0000001000378e0>] ia64_fault+0x240/0x11c0
[<a00000010000be40>] ia64_leave_kernel+0x0/0x290
But I must be severely misunderstanding something.
What I understood is that in preemptible sections preempt_count() is 
zero, and in non preemptible sections it is >0.
If preempt_count() is 1, then preempt_enable_no_resched() will decrement 
it and issue a warning. This is what happens in disabled_fph_fault().
Where am I wrong ?

Thanks, I'll try that.
