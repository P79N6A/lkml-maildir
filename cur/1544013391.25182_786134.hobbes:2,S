Quite right...

How about instead of a switch statement, assigning the message to a
variable and printing that. I.e. something like:
static enum hrtimer_restart ntp_leap_second(struct hrtimer *timer)
{
	enum hrtimer_restart res = HRTIMER_NORESTART;
	const char *msg = NULL;
	...
		msg = "Clock: inserting leap second 23:59:60 UTC";
	...
		msg = "Clock: deleting leap second 23:59:59 UTC";
	...
        if (msg)
                printk(KERN_NOTICE "%s\n", msg);
Cheers,
Duane.
