That doesn't really help.  Look at __generic_file_aio_write_nolock().
file_update_time() is called before the data is written, so after the
last write, there will be nothing to clear the flag.
And even if fixed this case by moving the file_update_time() call to
the end of the function, there's no guarantee, that some filesystem
won't do something exotic and call set_page_dirty() indenpendently of
write().  Good luck auditing all the set_page_dirty() calls ;)
Thanks,
Miklos
