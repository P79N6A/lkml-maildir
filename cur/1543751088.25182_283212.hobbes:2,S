Check to make sure DMA is on:
hdparm /dev/hda
If not, try turning it on:
hdparm -d 1 /dev/hda
When it's not on, you'll get bad performance (I usually get around 2 MB/s 
according to "hdparm -t /dev/hda") and high system CPU usage.  Because the 
rate is so low, for big files, the high CPU usage starves other processes for 
long enough that you notice.  With DMA, the transfer will be much faster and 
the CPU usage will be minimal.

If nature has made any one thing less susceptible than all others of exclusive 
property, it is the action of the thinking power called an idea.
