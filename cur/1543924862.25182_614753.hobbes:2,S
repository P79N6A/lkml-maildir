That is all true. The problem arises when you receive a tagged frame
on eth0, the chip removes the tag, and then the bridge sends it
out untagged on eth1.
I think there are two valid models for VLAN + bridging:
a) bridging works on "physical" interfaces, all tags are transmitted
   unchanged.
b) every VLAN is a different logical interface, packets from unknown
   VLANs are dropped on RX (and thus don't show up anywhere, except
   counters), bridging uses logical interfaces. VLAN 100 on eth0 may
   become VLAN 200 on eth1 and may be untagged on eth2.
"a" requires "soft" VLANs and/or adding the tags back (with
accelerated VLANs). This is how unmanaged switches labeled
"802.1Q - transparent" work. Not very flexible but usually good
enough.
"b" is how switches supporting VLANs (and 802.1Q) usually work.
I know ability to see exactly all packets as they are received
(including tags) is a really nice thing. But maybe we should change
the model? Making the ethX only carry untagged frames (even without
hw VLAN acceleration)?
