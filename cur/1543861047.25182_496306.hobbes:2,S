Subject: [RFC: 2.6 patch] mips: remove the broken BINFMT_IRIX code
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/1/4/206

The BINFMT_IRIX code:
- has been marked as BROKEN for more than two years years and
- is still marked as BROKEN.
Code that has been marked as BROKEN for such a long time seem to be 
unlikely to be revived in the forseeable future.
But if anyone wants to ever revive this driver, the code is still
present in the older kernel releases.
