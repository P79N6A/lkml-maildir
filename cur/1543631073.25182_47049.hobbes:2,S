Bzzzt.  Only if the permissions permitted it.
Example 1:
/home/bob/public_html
public_html  is user/group  bob/httpd
the perms are 2770
============================
Example 2:
All users on the system have a primary or secondary group "users"
/home/bob   user/group  bob/users
perms are 701
This explictly denies "users", yet allows Apache in (since it is running 
as httpd).
