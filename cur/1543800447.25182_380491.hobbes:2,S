Thanks for that.  For some reason my secondary zones at zonedit.com
were refusing to accept my recent DNS updates.  So I dropped zonedit
and switched to twisted4life.com as a secondary.  As a bonus,
twisted4life also provide a DNS checker which I could never find on
zoneedit.  It should all be resolving now, or as soon as the refresh
interval expires.
