Right, so our perception of state (which for all useful purposes /is/ 
the state) changed - "we have data" -> "we had to throw out data due 
to bad checksum" is a change in kernel state at least, if not in the 
(now gone) data.
I'm not really a kernel person. From the application POV, in the 
single-threaded case (cause the multi-threaded case is fairly 
pathological anyway), there /will/ be time between the select and the 
recvmsg, things /can/ change, and obviously they do.
Treating select as anything other than a useful hints mechanism is 
going to get you into trouble - just see the Stevens' example others 
gave for a long-standing example, in addition to this (sane imho) 
Linuxism.

Perception of state is as good as state here.

Right, yes, that seems to be clear now.
Though, I'd still say that any app that calls read/write functions 
without O_NONBLOCK set and that expects it will not block, is broken. 
Basic common sense really, never mind the fine details of POSIX on 
select(). ;)

Right.
