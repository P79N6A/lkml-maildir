ok, i've uploaded 2.6.13-rc6-rt6, which should fix this. (i've pushed 
the IRQ tracing into the raw_local_*() primitives, and kept the 
__raw_local_*() primitives clean, and ___trace() is using them now)
Does it boot for you now?
-rt6 also includes the USB fixes from Alan Stern, and an x64 fix from 
Dave Jiang. (albeit x64 likely doesnt work yet)
