The box has as AIC-7880U controller. OTOH, my dual P5 also has
an AIC7xxx controller and I've never seen the problem there...
On our quad Xeon this problem really seems to be phase-of-moon
related; it hasn't shown up in the last 5 days or so under heavy
stress testing, but when the kernel is compiled just a little bit
different it doesn't happen. ;)
