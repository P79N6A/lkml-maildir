I think no. From the quick reading, barrier_sync() and qrcu/srcu are
quite different. Consider:
barrier_lock()
				barrier_sync();
barrier_unlock();
				... wake up ...
							barrier_lock();
				schedule again
The last "schedule again" would be a BUG for qrcu/srcu, but probably
it is ok for barrier_sync(). It looks like barrier_sync() is more a
rw semaphore biased to readers.
A couple of minor off-topic notes,
+static inline void barrier_unlock(struct barrier *b)
+{
+       smp_wmb();
+       if (atomic_dec_and_test(&b->count))
+               __wake_up(&b->wait, TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE|TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE, 0, b);
This is wake_up_all(&b->wait), yes? I don't undestans why key == b, it could be NULL.
+static inline void barrier_sync(struct barrier *b)
+{
+       might_sleep();
+
+       if (unlikely(atomic_read(&b->count))) {
+               DEFINE_WAIT(wait);
+               prepare_to_wait(&b->wait, &wait, TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE);
+               while (atomic_read(&b->count))
+                       schedule();
+               finish_wait(&b->wait, &wait);
+       }
+}
This should be open-coded wait_event(), but wrong! With the scenario above this
can hang forever! because the first wake_up removes the task from the &b->wait.
