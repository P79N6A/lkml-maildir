Ah thanks. Sorry I have a very busy day at work and am unable to do
anything about it till tonight. I could imagine on nocona this would
be due to the idle task being scheduled on init - which it is not
supposed to do but if you read the comment in sched_init it says it
*might. I have no way of handling that at the moment because I wasn't
sure it ever happened any more.  As for the powerpc.. I have no idea
(from where I am at the moment which it would be totally inappopriate
for me to try to debug :P), sorry.
