Depends on the way you look at it. Cases such as yours are handled by 
reiserfsck, and moving reiserfsck into kernel space would be ... uh ... well, 
probably not the best. (Though, ever seen an auto repairing online
filesystem? ;-) Especially when fsck comes to interactive questions about what 
to repair/discard.
