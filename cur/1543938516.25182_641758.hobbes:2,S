That is very unfortunate.  We must continue to investigate.

No.  We figured that was the best way to go.  I don't know if there
are any technical reasons why it can't be shared, other then latency
problems.
But I would still prefer to figure out why 7 doesn't work - because there
is nothing in the hardware or kernel code that should prevent that.
Arnd - if you don't mind doing a little bit more debug work.  You've already
given us the MSRs for 0x51400020 - 0x51400023.  Can you now give us 
0x51400024-0x51400027, as well as 5140004E?  Our current working theory
is that IRQ7 (traditionally used by the LPT port) is still conflicting
somewhere.
