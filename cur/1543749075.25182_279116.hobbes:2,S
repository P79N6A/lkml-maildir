Yes.
On i386 kernels you can use mem=nopentium to force 4K pages for
the direct mapping, but that was dropped on x86-64.

check the data sheets, but iirc 64 large DTLBs and 1024+ 4K DTLBS.
That is the L2 TLB, there is also a L1 but it is likely inclusive (?)

First it depends on if you run irqbalanced or not and how many
interrupt sources you have.
Even when they are only handled on irq0 it can be still a good idea
to interleave to use the bandwidth of all memory controllers
in the system evenly.
