Subject: where should EXPORT_SYMBOLs go in 2.4.0test6-pre5?

When trying to compile 2.4.0test6-pre4 I get a lot of the following:
In file included from
/mnt/hd/src/linux-2.4.0test/include/linux/modversions.h:55,
                 from
/mnt/hd/src/linux-2.4.0test/include/linux/module.h:20,
                 from signal.c:11:
/mnt/hd/src/linux-2.4.0test/include/linux/modules/netsyms.ver:455: warning: `__ver_ipt_register_table'
redefined
/mnt/hd/src/linux-2.4.0test/include/linux/modules/ip_tables.ver:1: warning: this
is the location of the previous definition
/mnt/hd/src/linux-2.4.0test/include/linux/modules/netsyms.ver:457: warning: `__ver_ipt_unregister_table'
redefined
/mnt/hd/src/linux-2.4.0test/include/linux/modules/ip_tables.ver:3: warning: this
is the location of the previous definition
because ipt_register_table is exported both in linux/net/netsyms.c and
linux/net/ipv4/netfilter/ip_tables.c.  The additional definition appears
in the test6-pre5 patchset.  
Logically, which one should be kept and which one should be deleted?
I haven't seen mention of this problem, so am I the first to see
this?  If so, I'm wondering what I did different.
