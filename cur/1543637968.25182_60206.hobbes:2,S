IMO, the simpliest fix is to make change like replacing:
      tristate 'zlib decompression support' CONFIG_ZLIB_INFLATE
with:
      tristate 'zlib decompression support' CONFIG_ZLIB_INFLATE_X
      define_tristate CONFIG_ZLIB_INFLATE $CONFIG_ZLIB_INFLATE_X
+ rename the option in a help file (if it exist)
(not tested, but should work)

No. The problem is that variales associated with eg. "tristate" clauses
are always modified (even if its condition is false) during configuration 
refreshment - to store the previous value for the option.
Not good, but it is just bad project. Nobody wanted to rewrite xconfig
as CML2 was assumed to come soon...

I'm not sure it is so simple...
