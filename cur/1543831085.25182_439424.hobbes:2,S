This is what happens when you have PCI card in the bus next to your RAID 
card and run without my patch?  Hm...  this might be a regular driver 
bug.  Interesting that this driver might do an msleep right after the 
[ok] is printed.  Do you have kdb builtin to your kernel?  If so, maybe 
you could get a backtrace.  Otherwise you could put in some printk 
statements to see if we can figure out where the MCA is occuring...
