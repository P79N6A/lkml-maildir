I did a test on my kingston datatraveler recently, I didn't expect it to 
survive, but it did. I put reiserfs on it, and copied 394M of data in 
200,000 files to it. Reiserfs was sloooow at writing, the device was 
probably doing alot of work. ext2 was about 10X faster, but there was 
hardly any free space left at all at the end :)
Considering it surived ReiserFS, I suspect it would last ages with ext2, 
especially for your backup purposes.
