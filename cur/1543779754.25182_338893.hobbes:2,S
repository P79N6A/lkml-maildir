I misread that.  I'd latched onto the "selinux+capability" (again),
which combined would need only one spot.

Will do.

Oh, I didn't catch that.  I like it.  Will do.
So you mean 3 slots total including the shared one?
Any comments on the added argument to register_security and
mod_reg_security to request a static slot?  Given the likelyhood of
capability/cap_stack being registered, it seemed worthwhile not to have
it waste a spot, but it is an API change...
