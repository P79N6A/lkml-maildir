A sysctl can be a good option, creating a CTL_SECURITY and then
registering stuff under it, but this requires to have the kernel hackers
agree with implementing a new security suite and such.
In short, re-inventing the wheel.

It's currently made in vSecurity :)

At least I don't interfere with LSM, so, if no LSM hook adds it's own
security checks, then it gets used.

Good point, then the solution is to make it config-dependent, and that's
a thing that kernel hackers seem to dislike.
Lemme know what's the final thought on this, so, I could work out it and
give what you want, without time loss and we all can feel happy with
it :)
Cheers and thanks for the comments,
