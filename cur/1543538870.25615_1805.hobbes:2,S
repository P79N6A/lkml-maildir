Guys!!!!!
Well, let's just wait until the monolithic kernel is 500MB in size and
requires 8GB of ram to load (or alternately the .config file requies an
8GB disk to hold it when you build Linux).
What I am hearing are no technical arguments, just "control, control,
control ...".   What this would do is restrict folks from busting code
all the time by stopping people from changing interfaces all the time. 
Linux has matured -- it's time it started heading this way.  The
"freedom to bastardize" arguments were valid when Linux was growing up,
but it's an adult now, and how many ways can you re-organize a kernel? 
Time to focus on making it more maintainable and shippable, which Linus
agreed with -- his issue is the best way to do this, and I'll certainly
defer so he can explore this for himself and come up with a way he feels
OK with.  I understand the arguments, but sooner or later, we are going
to have to bite the bullet on this, or it's going to bite us.
Diverging a modular experimental tree to support this would be an easy
way to make the transition without disrupting the main stream kernel.
