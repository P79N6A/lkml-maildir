it doesn't matter in what space you are.  If the API really is similar
enough, then any piece of code (no matter where it was originally
intended to run) will be able to work with any such socket API.
The whole point of this is: Where is the derivation of an existing work?
I can write a program against some BSD socket api somewhere, and I can
easily make it use the proposed in-kernel sockets API.  No derivation of
anything that is inside the kernel and GPL licensed.

Neither am I, but I'm constantly dealing with legal questions related to
the GPL while running gpl-violations.org.
