Well, I think the BIOS doesn't touch the graphics during suspend to RAM and
resume, because it wants to save time.  ISTR, there is a limit on the amount
of time the BIOS can spend initializing devices and it doesn't get Windows
certification if that limit is not satisfied.
There's no such limit for hibernation, though, and the BIOS probably tries to
do something with the graphics before entering S4, but it should first check if
it's already in D3.
