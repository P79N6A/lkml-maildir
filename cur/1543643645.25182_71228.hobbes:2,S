The same thing happens on 2.5.35 as on 2.5.3[3-4]
: 
: Running the attached config on my HP Pavilion zt1195 laptop I get some strange
: keyboard and mouse behavior.  First, when I first try to log into X the keyboard
: is a little wacky: alt behaves as Fn, m doesn't work at all, etc.  It seems 
: to go away after a bunch of key presses for no apparent reason.  I do get
: this from the kernel log
: 
:       atkbd.c: Unknown key (set 2, scancode 0xbc, on isa0060/serio0) pressed.
: 
: but that's about it.  Then when X windows starts first my mouse buttons have
: been reversed from the normal left handed behavior and then when I try to
: cut and paste the cut motion never turns off so subsequent movements of the
: mouse just keep trying to select regions from that first window.  Eventually
: I just have to reboot so I can actually work normally.
