per the message below MD (or DM) would need to be modified to work 
reasonably well with one of the disk components being over an unreliable 
link (like a network link)
are the MD/DM maintainers interested in extending their code in this 
direction? or would they prefer to keep it simpler by being able to 
continue to assume that the raid components are connected over a highly 
reliable connection?
if they are interested in adding (and maintaining) this functionality then 
there is a real possibility that NBD+MD/DM could eliminate the need for 
DRDB. however if they are not interested in adding all the code to deal 
with the network type issues, then the argument that DRDB should not be 
merged becouse you can do the same thing with MD/DM + NBD is invalid and 
can be dropped/ignored
