It works here also, but I see a problem.
By deferring the flush, ioctl(TCFLSH) returns immediately
even though there is possibly still receive data being fed
to the ldisc.
If this is followed immediately by a read() then the
application gets unexpected (stale) data defeating the
purpose of the TCFLSH.
tty_buffer_flush() needs to wait for buf.flushpending to clear.
