I don't see anything that would break doing this, in fact you can
do this as long as the buffers are all at least a multiple of the
block size. All the drivers I've inspected handle this fine, noone
assumes that rq->bh->b_size is the same in all the buffers attached
to the request. This includes SCSI (scsi_lib.c builds sg tables),
IDE, and the Compaq array + Mylex driver. This mostly leaves the
"old-style" drivers using CURRENT etc, the kernel helpers for these
handle it as well.
So I would appreciate pointers to these devices that break so we
can inspect them.
