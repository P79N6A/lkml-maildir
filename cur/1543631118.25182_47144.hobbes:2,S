I agree. Its relatively easy for vendors to keep the stats in /proc/partitions
for 2.4.x (certainly adding other stuff instead to proc/partitions for 2.4
is bad). It is better that people are encouraged to use a new 2.5 compatible
interface over time and for later 2.4.x that vendors ship something with
both.
