call tty_insert_flip_*() from somewhere to put some data into tty recieve 
buffer, which is pushed into ldisc by tty_flip_buffer_push() and then sent by 
tty_read function (where ldisc read is called) to userspace for reading process.

open, settermios, write_room (note that this is minimal and will probably oops 
when poll or write is invoked) + some isr or timer to fill the buffer mentioned 
above.
