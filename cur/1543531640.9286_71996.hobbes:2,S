Think Alan is refering to VM/ESA.  It an OS that creates virtual machines.
In these virtual machines you can run almost any OS (including Linux) that
is coded for a S390.  To make things fast enough IBM created microcode and
special instructions to support a virtual supervisor mode.  ie
VM hypervisor (real supervisor mode)
guest os (virtual supervisor mode)

I hope so too.  This would be a very very nice thing to have.  Of all the IBM
system I have used over the years VM/ESA is the nicest.  I miss being able to 
test new OS version in a virtual machine...  I have worked more nights and 
weeks since I switched to the Unix than I have while using IBM's VM.

hypervisor, software and hardware that lets you run multiple virtual
machines (CPU(s), memory, devices (real and virtual)) under its control 
all on the same real box.
