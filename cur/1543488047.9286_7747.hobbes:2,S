I *guess* that the very first mmap() should be on the executable file
itself, no?  This is how it happens:
crosser@ariel:/src/sox-12.15/$ mount
[...]
hekate:/src on /auto/src type nfs (rw,addr=194.67.3.247)
crosser@ariel:/src/sox-12.15/$ ls -l sox
-rwxr-xr-x   1 crosser  sovam      429247 Feb 23 13:13 sox*
crosser@ariel:/src/sox-12.15/$ strace ./sox
mmap(0, 4096, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE|0x20, 4294967295, 0) =
0x40007000
