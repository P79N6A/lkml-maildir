Every project starts small and has the annoying tendency to grow.
That still doesn't answer, why it has to be distributed with the kernel, 
just install the thing somewhere under /lib and Kbuild can link to it. The 
point is that it contains nothing kernel specific and doesn't has to be 
rebult with every new kernel.
