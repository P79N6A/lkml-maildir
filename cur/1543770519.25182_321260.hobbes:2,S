Hello Jeff,
thanks for the info, and whats about Intel ICH6R and ICH7R anything
special there?
I played a bit with the patch and tried to tune it a bit. But there is
no Documentation
for AHCI in kernel.with parameter I can handover or can be changed.
Maybe I've missed them?
If so can you please refer me to one?
Thanks in advance and for help
Greets
