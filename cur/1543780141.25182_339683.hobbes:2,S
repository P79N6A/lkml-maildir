Hi
I'm new in the list and I'm interested in lkm, I have the Linux Device 
Drivers 2ed. And I use the 2.6.8-2 kernel, and the modules that I create 
I don't test in my workstation. Exist any way to run the examples 
exposed in this book over my kernel or I need the LDD 3ed ????
thx for your patient
Alejandro
