Subject: Suspected bug in fs/ufs/inode.c - test for < 0 on unsigned sector_t - [2.6.1-rc1-mm1]

Hi,
I think I may have found a bug in fs/ufs/inode.c
lines 334 & 335 have this code (in function ufs_getfrag_block) :
	if (fragment < 0)
		goto abort_negative;
fragment is an argument to ufs_getfrag_block of type sector_t
digging a little in include/linux and include/asm reveals sector_t to be
an an unsigned type in all archs (at least as far as I've been able to
determine).
include/linux/types.h defines sector_t as
typedef unsigned long sector_t;
and in include/asm* sector_t is defined as :
asm-sh/types.h:typedef u64 sector_t;
asm-x86_64/types.h:typedef u64 sector_t;
asm-h8300/types.h:typedef u64 sector_t;
asm-i386/types.h:typedef u64 sector_t;
asm-mips/types.h:typedef u64 sector_t;
asm-s390/types.h:typedef u64 sector_t;
asm-ppc/types.h:typedef u64 sector_t;
all unsigned types.
So, since sector_t is unsigned it can never be less than zero, hence the
branch on line 334 will never be taken and the assiciated label
"abort_negative" will never be reached (and it's not referenced anywhere
else).
I don't know enough about UFS to be able to tell if this is actually a
problem or not, but I suspect that it might be.. If it's not a problem,
then the code that tests for (fragment < 0) and the associated code
in abort_negative might as well be removed.
Is this analysis correct?  If it is, can the code simply be removed?
Kind regards,
Jesper Juhl
