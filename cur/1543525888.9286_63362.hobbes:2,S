If you are talking about linux it uses the APM Bios. If you are talking about
Elan it should have its own power management which should be in the AMD docs.

APM as implemented in the kernel has been in Phoenix BIOS spec long before
pentium and was first put there because of OS2 which was the first system to
use the protected mode iface. You best bet will be to ignore the existing
kernel apm and rewrite the apm alltogether.
This is all "if I recall correctly", I had the same idea for something like
that with an Elan a while ago... It is a good chip... Though I am unsure how
are you going to get eepro100 working in view of Elan's differences in DMA and
busmastering (or lack of thereof).
