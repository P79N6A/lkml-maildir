Sorry.
It's a new connection from the persist option.  The exact same message
repeats for every dial out it attempts.
It's a PCI 3com 56k Sportster.  It's a hardware modem.
There is sometimes another pppd up on ttys1
Here's the setup:
There is an external modem on ttyS01, irq 3, that dials in occasionally as
needed.
there is an internal PCI modem on ttyS04, irq 5, that dials in permamently
to the ISP.
Every 6 hours, the ISP enforces the 6 hour hangup rule they have.
The modem is set to persist, max-fails 0.  It is not able to redial, and
keeps giving the error message that i pasted.
Under 2.2.x, this functioned properly.
System is a VIA VT82C693A/694x [Apollo PRO133x] based motherboard, from
Giga-byte, if I remember correctly.  Celeron 533.
Sorry about the too brief error message, I fell into my "it makes sense to
me the way it is" trap.
