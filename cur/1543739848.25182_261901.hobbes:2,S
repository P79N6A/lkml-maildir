Yes, I can reveal them. All of XFS, All of JFS, and All of the SMP 
Support in Linux. I have no
idea what the hell RCU is and when I find it, I'll remove it from the code.
I don't work for Canopy. I know those guys but we parted ways a few 
years back. Utah Valley
is sort of incenstuous, if you lived here, you would understand. It's a 
small place.
