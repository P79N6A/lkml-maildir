I wished someone to confirm the following: Is it a
requirement for the user space buffer that is provided
to the recvfrom() socket call, be 4 byte aligned?.
Note that sockets are raw sockets (PF_PACKET type). I
am running linux 2.4.18-10 on a dual xeon P4 (x86)
box. At the lowest level, i think this translates to
how strong the requirements are for copy_to_user().
does it fault to byte-by-byte mode gracefully when
given a non-4byte aligned buffer?.
Please include me in all replies, since i'm not

Thanks
