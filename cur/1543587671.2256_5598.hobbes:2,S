Few comments:
When .config is missing and error is emitted when running make menuconfig 
(or any other I guess) for the first time. Should this be the case? It's 
ignored so ok but still would be nice not to have an error.
In ttyconfig: If type 'a' then enter then 'a' then enter then 'v' then 
enter it crashes out... Might be specific to where you are at the time. 
Sorry don't remember.
Good performance going up/down in menuconfig now. Even on my Pentium 133S! 
Excellent work! (fastmode on)
Best regards,
         Anton
