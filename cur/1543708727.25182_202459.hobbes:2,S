Subject: 2.6.3: Early lockup during boot on Athlon and Opteron Boards

Hi,
this happens with a 2.6.3 kernel:
- on an Athlon board (K7V333), immediately after "using anticipatory
scheduler", the system freezes, hard reset necessary.
- on an Athlon board (A7N8X Deluxe with nforce2 chipset), immediately
after the initialization of the IDE subsystem, the system freezes, hard
reset necessary.
- on an Opteron 246 board (Tyan with AMD8111/8131/8151 chipset),
immediately after the initialization of the IDE subsystem, the system
freezes, hard reset necessary.
I have applied the latest ACPI patch posted here some two days ago.
Now, this all did NOT occur with a 2.6.2 kernel or earlier.
I tried all possible boot options I know off:
noapic, acpi=off, ide?=serialize, pci=usepirq,...
it all did not help.
I realized similar problems have already been mentioned on LKML:
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0402.3/0420.html
 (and
related)
Now I did not see any of the patches offered there checked in at
Bitkeeper. Also, some did apply when I gave them a try, and moreover, this
happens not only on Nforce2 boards, though the symptoms are the same.
Has anyone ideas?
Can I try something in order to get rid of this deadlock?
Best regards
Olive
