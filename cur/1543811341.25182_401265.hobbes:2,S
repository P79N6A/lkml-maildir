Well, yes.  That's what I would do, were I still maintaining the IDE layer.
But that code has become so twisted and confused since then,
that a change like this is probably too risky/challenging for
the current maintainers.  It seems really easy to break stuff
when touching parts of that code now, and people don't like it
much when their hard drives get corrupted.
But perhaps someone may successfully implement this.
Cheers
