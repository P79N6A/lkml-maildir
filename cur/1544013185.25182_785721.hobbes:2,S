Subject: libusb broken on 2.6.28 x86_64 ?

I'm trying to use 2.6.28 for the first time on an x86_64 box here
with devices controlled by libusb.  The devices work on the first
access, but then fail on all subsequent accesses.  Unplugging/replugging
causes them to work again for a single subsequent access.
This is with two completely different USB gadgets:
a VFD alphanumeric display, and an FTDI serial device in bitbang mode.
Did something break in 2.6.28 for libusb devices ??
Cheers
