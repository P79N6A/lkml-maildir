The main problem with this driver is, that if I do like this, then every 
10 seconds I receive new message from the network card in kernel log.
There is following message:
Sep  4 16:31:43 laptop_mirka eth0: PHY reset until link up
Sep  4 16:31:53 laptop_mirka eth0: PHY reset until link up
Do you think, that this is correct way t do the things? I
In my opinion, the solution, that link status can be checked (if 
hardware allow this) when interface is down is more usefull.
