Of course! But the convention must be, that If userspace wants to
access the data, it has to use our standard linux
parser. If it accesses the data directly, this is broken.
This ensures, that whitespaces do not matter at all! And as
I said before, if you use the parser, you don't have any
difference compared to the filesystem solution from a logical
perspective.
