Linus,
As  previously mentioned, I have offered many patches and a lot of 
source to the community throughout the last 15 years. Either personally 
or via Linuxant, under various licenses (including the GPL) depending 
on the constraints imposed by each situation, and continue doing so. In 
the workaround case, we should have admittedly sent a patch earlier 
instead of putting in the \0 and I sincerely apologized for that.
The modules in question are not binary-only, but mixed source/binary. 
With the submitted patch, we are also offering to take as much support 
burden off the community by clarifying the messages to explicitly 
direct users to where they should go for help when using third-party 
modules.
With all due respect, your claims that we are offering nothing / not 
giving back are not factual and you should not take position based on 
either incorrect information or a very narrow / alarmist interpretation 
of what we are doing.
Regards
Marc
