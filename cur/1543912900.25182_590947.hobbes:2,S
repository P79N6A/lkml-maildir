Hi Peter,
Items in contrib aren't officially supported, so it doesn't sound like
a good idea to offer installs for them.  Of course, it might be a good
idea to promote git-p4 up out of contrib and add it to the spec file.
As things stand now, do you get an error when trying to upgrade Git via
yum?   I'd have thought things would upgrade fine but leave the old git-p4
rpm hanging around.  Either way, the obsoletes line mentioned by David
sounds like the right solution.
As an aside, when I sent the patch removing git-p4import from the spec
file I mentioned that I had no way to test it and asked for testers.
Git needs a spec file maintainer so that issues like this can be caught
before release.  Without a maintainer, it should probably be demoted
to contrib itself.
