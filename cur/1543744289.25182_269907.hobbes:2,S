I guess it's saying that if you do this:
	local_irq_disable();
	lah_de_dah();
	local_irq_enable();
then you should follow that by
	preempt_check_resched();
just in case someone told this task to preempt itself while it had
interrupts disabled.
But I don't see why that's needed: if the preempt command came from another
CPU then this CPU will take the cross-CPU interrupt as soon as interrupts
are enabled.  And the preempt command couldn't have come from _this_ CPU,
because it had interrupts disabled.
