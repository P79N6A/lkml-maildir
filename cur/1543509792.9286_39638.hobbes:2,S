IMHO in 2.3.18* the buffer flushing code is bad. IMHO there's no way to
take it as it is for 2.4.x if we want decent cache performances (with
decent I mean at least as 2.2.x). I am rewriting the algorithms from
scratch as I just have invented my own heuristic and so now I really want
to implement them as I want my system running as I want for me. So expect
a re-write also from me.
