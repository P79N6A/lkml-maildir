I've uploaded the 2.2.11pre6->7 patch to ftp.kernel.org:/pub/linux/kernel/alan
This one contains:
o	Second set of merges from DaveM
o	Alpha compile fix
o	SIS 900 PCI ethernet driver
This should mean 2.2.11pre7 is the final ready for 2.2.11. I've got various
other patches from people queued because I want them to be in 2.2.12 so that
2.2.11 doesn't get too many non driver changes.
Please test this one hard folks.
Alan
