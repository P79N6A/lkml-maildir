No, I'm quite happy that this is all.

Then would you consider relicensing Linux under GPLv3 + additional
permission for Tivoization?

I didn't.  But I've provided evidence that your prior musings on this
topic were wrong.  I wanted to give you an opportunity to review your
position under this new light.  I see you haven't changed it at all.

Forgive me if I find this a bit hard, because that's *not* what the
GPL says.
Where do you think the GPL say that you get the source code back?

See, that's not what the license says.
The license says what you ask for is respect for other users'
freedoms.  Nothing whatsoever for you.  Only for users.
Freedom is in "in kind" payment, and it's not even a retribution, a
payback: it's payforward, or paysideways.
Do you understand why I find your reasoning hard to accept?

We don't have to agree on our individual definitions of freedom.  But
we're talking about a specific license that assigns a specific meaning
to the term "freedoms", and that's all this is about.

I can appreciate that you think it's better, but unfortunately it
appears to be playing a significant role in confusing your
interpretation of the GPL.  The GPL is not just about making the
source code visible, or even modifyable by others.  It's about
respecting others' freedoms.  No matter how badly you prefer Open
Source over Free Software, how badly you'd rather disregard the
freedoms in the spirit and in the legal terms of the GPL, you chose a
license designed to protect those freedoms, not only the ability to
see and modify source code.

I'm afraid that's not what the GPLv2 says.  There's no provision
whatsoever about giving anything back.  Not in the spirit, not in the
legal terms.
