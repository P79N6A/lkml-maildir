Regardless of who it is, people have to stop fighting over ->sysdata.
It's unscalable, regardless of who it is.
Whoever wants to be upstream first should take the basic "x86 sysdata"
bits from jgarzik/misc-2.6.git#pciseg and push those upstream...  which
I note includes Calgary work.
Then NUMA, Calgary and PCI domain stuff merely involve modifying the x86
version of struct pci_sysdata.
I would NAK any [PCI domain | NUMA | Calgary]-only approach to using
->sysdata.  It clearly does NOT belong to any one subsystem, regardless
of who gets upstream first.
Drop git-pciseg?  sure.  Make sysdata Calgary-specific?  NAK.
