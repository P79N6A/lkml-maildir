Dear All,
We am trying to use CRAMFS for the target board which has
8 MB flash and 32 MB RAM.
I have few clarifications regarding CRAMFS.
1) Does CRAMFS requires initrd support?
2) From the net and few archival mails, i get to know that CRAMFS 
can
be built in 2 ways. One building with the kernel and the other 
one
creating the CRAMFS image and writing that image in to the 
flash.
3) Also if i wan to build with the kernel, whether the same 
procedure for ramdisk can be used? i.e. creating CRAMFS image, 
coverting it to
a object code format and copy it to src/linux/arch/mips/boot as 
ramdisk.o.
Thanks in advance,
Nanda
