Andries, 
I sent revisions to the vfork() and fork() man pages to you months ago.  
This controversial syscall was publically and vigorously debated on
the linux-kernel list in January of this year, prior to its inclusion
in the 2.2 kernels.  See the archives.
The decision to implement was made with the blessing (and assistance) of 
the keeper of the kernel himself.  Considerations included performance, 
conformance to published standards, existing implementations in Solaris, 
HP-UX, Open/Free/NetBSD, etc, and porting of existing application code.
IMHO, creating manual pages which argue that a syscall is evil, broken
as designed, etc, is NOT appopriate.  We have better forums for such
discussions.
If the vfork() syscall is evil then lets reopen the public discussion and
reach a decision to either accept it or pull it from the kernel entirely.  
Otherwise, let the man pages document its semantics/behavior, along 
with a warning that the porting issue cuts both ways.
