Block devices will go through the page cache in 2.5.  It will take a
while for the buffer cache to go away completely, but it is there for
the code paths that haven't been updated.  Buffer heads will stay.
The /dev/raw stuff is for those users that don't want to the kernel to
cache their data and will continue to exist in some form.

I can't see how any device that doesn't support read or writing just a
byte can be a character device.
