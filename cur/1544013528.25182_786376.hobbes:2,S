Now that you mention this the second time, I have to ask where you have
this information from. Since I use Gentoo, I was always able to compile
OpenOffice (version 1, 2 and now 3) myself.
At the same time, it was always possible to use prebuilt packages as an
alternative - the same way as it is possible for a few other packages
(Firefox, Thunderbird, Seamonkey, maybe more). But AFAIK compiling from
source is still the preferred method.
