The reliable way to detect an HGA card is to run through the VGA/EGA detect
and only if VGA/EGA fails then check that the light pen port is changing value
as you would expect. The light pen port check is used heavily - clone Herc
cards emulate its behaviour even if they dont have one
This is well documented in some of the PC video books
