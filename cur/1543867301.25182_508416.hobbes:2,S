The cachemiss names are confusing. I assume that's just a left over
from Tux?

It's a little unclear why you do that many individual access_ok()s.
And why is the target constant sized anyways?

If it's only a few pages you don't need any resource accounting.
If it's more then it's nasty to steal the users quota.
I think plain gup() would be better.
