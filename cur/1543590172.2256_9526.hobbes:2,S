!0 is 1.  !(anything else) is 0.  It is zero and one, not
zero and "non-zero".  So a !! construction gives zero if you have
zero, and one if you had anything else.  There's no doubt about it.

Thats your opinion.  There are many others.  Some don't like the
?: at all, for example.  And some like all valid C.
