I'm positive the potential is there.

OK.  In the current code, domain validation is done from the workqueue
interface.  This can take several seconds per target to complete.  Why
should I have to wait this extra time.  As I move other SCSI daemon
threads to being work queue items, these times rise.
However, now there's a worse problem.  If I want to cancel a piece of
work synchronously, flush_scheduled_work() makes me dependent on the
execution of all the prior pieces of work.  If some of them are related,
like Domain Validation and device unlocking say, I have to now be
extremely careful that the place I cancel and flush from isn't likely to
deadlock with any other work scheduled on the device.  This makes it a
hard to use interface.  By contrast, the proposed patch will *only* wait
if the item of work is currently executing.  This is a (OK reasonably
given the aic del_timer_sync() issues) well understood deadlock
problem---the main point being I now don't have to consider any of the
other work that might be queued.
