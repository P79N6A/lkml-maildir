Do you really believe that M$ will allow it to go away? In my opinion,
they're too committed to backwards-compatibility for that.
What I *CAN* see happenning is for FAT28/32 (whatever) getting larger
clusters for the FAT to refer to, thus pushing that limit upwards as
well. Here's my calculations relating to this:
 1. FAT28 with 512 byte clusters provides 2^27k of data space max.
    That gives 2^7 = 128 Gigabytes max per partition.
 2. Based on that, I would foresee the following partition limits per
    cluster size applying:
	Cluster size	Partition Size
	~~~~~~~~~~~~	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	    0.5 k		 128 G
	     1 k		 256 G
	     2 k	  0.5 T	 512 G
	     4 k	   1 T
	     8 k	   2 T
	    16 k	   4 T
	    32 k	   8 T
	    64 k	  16 T
 3. Alternatively, I can see FAT28 turning into FAT32, which would
    provide the following limits:
	Cluster size	Partition Size
	~~~~~~~~~~~~	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	    0.5 k	    2 T
	     1 k	    4 T
	     2 k	    8 T
	     4 k	   16 T
	     8 k	   32 T
	    16 k	   64 T
	    32 k	  128 T
	    64 k	  256 T
Either way, the limit is considerably higher than the 2 Terabytes
mentioned in the original postee's message.
Best wishes from Riley.
