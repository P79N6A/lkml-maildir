Returning an error and still doing the operation is slightly awkward.
Are there any other syscalls which do similar things?
Of course, a significant portion of TCP related code would leak
descriptors like hell if the behavior of close() ischanged (there are
quite a few protocols which do not avoid race conditions resulting in
ECONNRESET connection teardown).
