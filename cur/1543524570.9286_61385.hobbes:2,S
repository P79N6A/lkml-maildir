   I developed from scratch rw semaphores based on spinlocks. The
   overhead seems quite load by looking the code and they are at least
   quite obviously right ;). BTW, they are not architecture-dependent
   so other archs can cut and past if necessary.
Although the generic implementation is useful, the Alpha
version should use the ll/sc atomic update sequences.
Have a look at the sparc64 version for one way to implement
that.
