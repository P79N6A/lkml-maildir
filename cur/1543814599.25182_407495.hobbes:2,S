True priority support in the form of a "vm scheduler" is something I've 
mentioned many times in the past. The overhead would not be insignificant. 
Nonetheless I do have some weak priority support for page reclaiming in my 
-ck tree because doing so was not overly expensive. As far as I'm aware noone 
is currently working on a comprehensive vm scheduler.
