Yep. That's exactly the point: That they don't come back later and scream
they just patented the for loop, and that its inclusion wasn't legitimate.

Tough luck, IMEHO.

I'd hope this gets part of the normal patch flow sooner or later, so that
this will only have to be done on occasion.

What should be done is that Someone In Power signs off the patch(es)
contributed by said company. This is to have a way to trace to someone who
willingly (and taking responsibility) contributed each patch. Sure, it'd be
nice to also know who commited some heinous crime(s), but...
Remember, what Linus wants is that no onne can pull an SCOX on Linux: If
they come screaming that it contains preciousss IP, you can show in detail
where it came from and make sure it is legitimate (or whom to blame, as the
case may be).

What you should care about is that the next in line signed off their
contribution(s) or certifies the origin.

Much less hassle than FSF's paperwork, to be sure.
