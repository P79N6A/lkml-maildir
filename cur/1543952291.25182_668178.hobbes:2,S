I am yet to measure the performance overhead of the accounting checks. I'll try
and get started on that today. I did not consider making it a separate system,
because I suspect that anybody wanting memory control would also want address
space control (for the advantages listed in the documentation). I am not against
the idea of making it a separate subsystem, but first let me get back with the
numbers.
