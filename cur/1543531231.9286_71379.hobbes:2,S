Far from it. I get the impression that the opponents of
demand-allocated memory have been living on a BBC Micro for their
entire careers, and would like to have the same system under Unix...

There are some circumstances where you DO want/need direct control
over memory allocation, stack size etc. Embedded apps, for example, as
discussed elsewhere in l-k. Desktop/server apps, OTOH, are not in this
category normally. An EXTENSION to the API to ALLOW this for apps
would be useful - changing the existing API to do this would be silly.
