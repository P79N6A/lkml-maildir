Heh.
I integrated "ati_video.c" from ati_xv into the current XFree86 CVS
sources, and yup, sure as h*ll, I can play movies fine. Quite smooth (at
least the 24 fps stuff - I bet it drops frames like mad for any 30fps
movies). It's quite cute.
There's some redraw bug in the overlay code, and it doesn't understand
virtual desktops larger than the physical desktop. Details, details. 
	Thanks for the pointer,
