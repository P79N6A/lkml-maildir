Subject: [PATCH] autofs4 symlink size
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I sent this to the autofs4 maintainer a while ago, but never heard back.
autofs4 doesn't return a size for the symlinks it creates, which is
inconsistent with other filesystems.  (The Almquist shell uses the sizes
of path components to allocate buffers during a walk, so it can't traverse
autofs4-linked paths.)
This patch applies against 2.4.9 (and probably earlier) through 2.4.13.
