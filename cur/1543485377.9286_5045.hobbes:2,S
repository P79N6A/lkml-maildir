I think I'm in love!  A wonderful tool.
Quite impressive being able to place a breakpoint om "udp_rcv" and
examine the UDP packet received and everything else in the SKB.  And
then type "continue" and see everything go on as if nothing has
happened.
The -fomit-frame-pointer was needed though, the stackframes were
somewhat messed up before that.
