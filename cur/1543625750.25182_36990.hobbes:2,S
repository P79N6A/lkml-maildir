Yes, the memset is bogus because I didn't cast the pointer to a
char * or void *. The memcpy should be fine, though. And so should
everything else, because the bitfield array is allocated in 16 byte
multiples. So there should be no issues with big vs. little endian,
since memset/memcpy operations are done in blocks of sufficient
alignment.
So, really, the only problem is the stupid lack of a cast. Unless you
noticed some other problem?
