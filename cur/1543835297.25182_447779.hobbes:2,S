Why should there be any problem taking the remote l3 lock?  If the remote
node does not have cpu that does not mean we cannot take a lock from the
local node!!! 
I think current git does not teach lockdep to ignore recursion for
array_cache->lock when the array_cache->lock are from different cases.  As
Arjan pointed out, I can see that l3->list_lock is special cased, but I
cannot find where array_cache->lock is taken care of.
Again, if this is indeed a problem (recursion) machine should not boot even,
when compiled without lockdep, tglx, can you please verify this?
Thanks,
Kiran
