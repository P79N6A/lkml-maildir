I just found that if using cdda2wav but use it
cooked_ctl interface (not the scsi one so I dont use
ide-scsi any more) it works ; still until the last
audio track it still report some error and hang , need
to do Ctrl+C to stop it. However the last sound track
is normal when play it. Use cdparanoia for both
(ide-scsi or ide-cd) it works as normal.
I suspect bug in cdda2wav, or ide-scsi combination
when readding cd text and info (I think cdparanoia
does not read cd text). it may even be that my audio
disc has some damage.
I will test with other audio cd today to see what
happened.
