I should probably include some details about my IDE devices.
here's the controller for the devices in question. it's the second
controller on the mobo. (first controller is only ATA-66)
00:11.0 Unknown mass storage controller: Promise Technology, Inc. 20265 (rev
02)
        Subsystem: Promise Technology, Inc. Ultra100
        Control: I/O+ Mem+ BusMaster+ SpecCycle- MemWINV- VGASnoop- ParErr-
Stepping- SERR- FastB2B-
        Status: Cap+ 66Mhz- UDF- FastB2B- ParErr- DEVSEL=medium >TAbort-
<TAbort- <MAbort- >SERR- <PERR-
        Latency: 32
        Interrupt: pin A routed to IRQ 9
        Region 0: I/O ports at 9400 [size=8]
        Region 1: I/O ports at 9000 [size=4]
        Region 2: I/O ports at 8800 [size=8]
        Region 3: I/O ports at 8400 [size=4]
        Region 4: I/O ports at 8000 [size=64]
        Region 5: Memory at de800000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=128K]
        Expansion ROM at <unassigned> [disabled] [size=64K]
        Capabilities: <available only to root>
and here's the output of hdparm. (yes, I know it could probably get tweaked
a bit for performance. this is a brand-new drive arrangement, and I was
trying to run it in a 'safe' setting for a while to see if anything would go
wrong. well, it did).
~# hdparm /dev/hde
/dev/hde:
 multcount    =  0 (off)
 IO_support   =  0 (default 16-bit)
 unmaskirq    =  0 (off)
 using_dma    =  1 (on)
 keepsettings =  0 (off)
 readonly     =  0 (off)
 readahead    =  8 (on)
 geometry     = 155061/16/63, sectors = 156301488, start = 0
~# hdparm /dev/hdf
/dev/hdf:
 multcount    =  0 (off)
 IO_support   =  0 (default 16-bit)
 unmaskirq    =  0 (off)
 using_dma    =  1 (on)
 keepsettings =  0 (off)
 readonly     =  0 (off)
 readahead    =  8 (on)
