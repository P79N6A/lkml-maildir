It sounds to me like any existing file system is just going to get in 
your way.  What you need is a simple filesystem that just has one file, 
and it takes up the whole partition, can't be truncated or extended, 
no index, no inodes, no directories, no permissions, nothing.  Just 
straight I/O to the disk.  If this partition exists on a dedicated disk 
you'll be completely in control of all seeking.  You can keep any
indices you need in a file on another partition.  
This really wouldn't be very hard to write - it's sort of the "null 
filesystem" and it would fit nicely into the vfs model.  You could 
call it "raw": 
  mount -t raw /dev/hdb1 /muchmusic
You can make it as a module so you don't have to patch the kernel:
  insmod raw.o
The easiest way to make it would be to take the simplest of the existing
filesystems (minix I think) and gut it.  You should be left with just a
couple of hundred lines when you're finished, mostly lists of null file
operations, etc.  The result would be really useful.
All in my very humble opinion, of course.
