Really good wearleveling will even move blocks that "never" seem to
change to the more used blocks ones in a while to spread out the wear to
blocks that have static content in them.  After all if 90% of your flash
never changes, and you run a log in the last 10%, you will still wear
out that 10% first if you don't occationally move some of the static
content to the 10% with some wear, and start running your log on the
previously unused area.
I was told by someone from SanDisk that this is how _some_ of their
flash media work (at least on the new ones).
I was actually surprised since I assumed at the time this was how all of
the CF cards worked.
