Small differences? The only thing I would call small is the latency of the
jam kernel!
If (a) this is a real value which results in ~5x latency reduction in
non-benchmark applications, and (b) doesn't have some resulting penalty
(there are some free lunches in Linux), then it would be desirable.
I have an IPC test which measures time for a datum to move form process A
to process B and back, using various methods, I'll try to build these
kernels and test it in my next free day. I'd love to test latency of SysV
message queues as well, since these turn out to be good solutions to some
types of N:M client-server problems.
