The problem is of course that you need these in your tree for ongoing
development, but 2.6.25 is months away.  They look OK to me so I suggest
that you go ahead and commit them to your git tree and I'll drop them
again.  Please resend them for merging in the 2.6.25-rc1 merge window.
unionfs has been hanging around for a long time now and we should work
towards getting it into 2.6.25 or dropped from -mm (sorry).  Right now
would be a great time to get this process underway.  
I have only a partial memory of what the sticking points were, and I have
basically zero knowledge of what was done to address them.  So could you
please, over the next few weeks:
- Send out a description of what the issues were, and how they were addressed
- If issues remain, describe their impact and possible workarounds, all
  that stuff.
- If it mostly-survives all that design-level review and consideration
  then let's go for it: get all the patches cleaned up and consolidated and
  get them emailed out for review no later than 2.6.24-rc5.
Thanks.
