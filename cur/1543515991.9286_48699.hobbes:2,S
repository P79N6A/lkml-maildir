I think it's probably been done before, but in the last couple days
I've been playing with the kernel build system to this end.  (Partly
because it will be useful and partly as an exercise to learn the kbuild
system better.)
My changes so far are a little script that creates the directory
hierarchy and symlinks the Makefiles, a little rearranging of include/
which features a build/ directory for volatile things, and some random
hackery in places like Makefile, Rules.make and scripts/Configure.  A
lot of it seems to almost work.  `make dep' gave me a little trouble,
since it is so highly optimized for the status quo....

Am I understanding you correctly?  It sounds like you mean
  $ tar xzf foo-1.0.tar.gz
  $ mkdir foo-obj
  $ cd foo-obj
  $ ../foo-1.0/configure
  $ make
This works fine for all autoconf-based packages I use.  Perhaps it
only works with GNU make, I don't know.

Yeah, those are some of the issues I've hit.

OK, here's a question: what kernel build system features are GNU
extensions?  I.e. what would need to be reworked for pmake?
