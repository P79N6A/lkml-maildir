I don't want this to become the latest pro/against threads but if your
processing thread block for a long time you should consider handling the
blocking condition asynchronously. If your procesing thread blocks, your
application model should very likely be redesigned, or you just go with
threads ( and you do not need any multiplex interface ).

Your assumption is wrong, the registration is done as soon as the fd
"born" ( socket() or accept() for example ) and is typically removed when
it dies.
