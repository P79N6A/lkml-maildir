	Maybe because of nightly running applications, not releasing
	shared memory and other IPC stuf, producing amazingly zombies,
	preventing useful tasks to run (such as backup & Co).
	Yes, scripts could be written to attempt to cleanly put
	things up, but usually the best way is to reboot regularly.
	And, with Linux + autofs, taking into account dynamic modifications
	of the NIS automount tables is possible without rebooting but
	is quite painful with 100 or so machines. Sun's automount is
	much better in reconfiguration...
	However, whenever we can keep the uptime rising, we do it :-)
