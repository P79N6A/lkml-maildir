Hi!

The router through which my private subnet work box passes sends a 14-group "invalid" > mac address, presumably as an attempt to conceal the real hextile mac address. However, the code for the > --mac-source netfilter option is looking for a valid hextile mac address and complains loudly as such (numerals converted to x's):

I know this option is tagged by Rusty as experimental still so I would assume that the code is open for feedback ;) The question could be rephrased as: is there any chance of allowing "invalid" mac addresses to be recognized by the --mac-source option of the netfilter code? Running Redhat v7/kernel 2.4.1-ac15.
Umm..  An ethernet MAC address is 48bit long, ie AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF, 6
groups, not 14. Is this really an ethernet
interface? (If it really has 14 groups).
