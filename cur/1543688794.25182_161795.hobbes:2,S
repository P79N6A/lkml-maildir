Aside from the general unshare fixes here is the other small problem you
need to look at 
#1 You can't assume /dev/fd/0 so why not just pass the filehandle number
as argv1 instead like the a.out loader did years ago
#2 Use snprintf not sprintf (Im sure sprintf is safe here but its easier
to audit code if you use snprintf)
#3 The instant you pass control to the user space loader I can steal the
handle via /proc
#4 The instant you pass control to the user space loader I can take it
over via ptrace
#5 After you pass control I can core dump the app and recover the data
using a signal
3, 4 and 5 require you make the userspace loader undumpable in the case 
where the fd being passed on is executable only. If you do this then it
certainly fixes 4 (permission denied) and 5 (no dump) and I think it
fixes #3
