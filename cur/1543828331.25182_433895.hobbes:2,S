Is the Microsoft Wireless Desktop 6000 supported under Linux? I am
plugging the dongle into the motherboard port and under Linux 2.6.17 I
cannot see it, but get the following error messages in the log:

This is on a Asus A8N-SLI motheboard using Nforce4 chipset. I have plugged it
into a Laptop using the Intel BX chipset, but I wasn't getting even these
errors. Nothing at all.
The OS is debian testing/unstable . Is there anything I can do to help debug
this problem?
Thank you,
florin
