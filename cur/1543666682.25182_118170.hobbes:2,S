There is no easy way, there isn't even a single "biggest .config".
Some drivers are mutually exclusive, so you have to chose.
Tomorrow at work, I can send you a .config that should have almost
everything compiled into the kernel, for i386 uniprocessor, linux
2.4.21-pre3.
If you manage to create an even bigger .config from that base or have
other maxed our configs for smp, other platforms or other kernels, I'd
like to get a copy. But make sure they compile first. :)
