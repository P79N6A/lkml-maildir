Thanks. Right now getting 2.4 into a better shape is more
important than fixing 2.5, so if you find any problems repeatable
in 2.4.17rc1, Marcelo really needs to know about it.
The only USB changes in my tree are __devinit_p changes, which
really shouldn't be causing a problem, but there could be some
other unrelated-to-usb patch which is causing this..
2.4 info would be appreciated.
Dave.
