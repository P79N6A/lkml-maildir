Hi,
  Does anybody know how to check the validity of a deamon. which runs on Linux 
-platform host . This daemon can save some information in a log file of the 
host. I mean that if an attacker compromises this host and gets root access, 
he can replace this daemon with a rogue version. Therfefore, the information 
saved on the log file is incorrect. So how can I check the validity of the 
daemon to show this  daemon is correct version and not a rogue version. So I 
trust the information saved on the host.
  Cheers
