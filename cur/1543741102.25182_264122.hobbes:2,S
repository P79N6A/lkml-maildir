Subject: [PATCH] omit CommitAvail
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/10/24/118

CommitLimit was a good addition to /proc/meminfo, but we don't usually
show both what's used and what's free: don't waste lines of screenspace,
omit CommitAvail, let the user do the arithmetic as with all the others.
And in updating that Documentation, removed the long-gone ReverseMaps.
