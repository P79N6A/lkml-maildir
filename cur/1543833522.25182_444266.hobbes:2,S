But it looks like the mismatch could persist indefinitely: if a seccomp
task inherits the wrong cr4 flag it could pass it on to another, or back
to the original one and so on.  I think this is the only safe way:
	if (test_tsk_thread_flag(next_p, TIF_NOTSC) ||
	    test_tsk_thread_flag(prev_p, TIF_NOTSC)) {
		/* Flip TSC disable bit if necessary. */
		unsigned int cr4 = read_cr4();
		if (test_tsk_thread_flag(next_p, TIF_NOTSC)) {
			if (!(cr4 & X86_CR4_TSD))
				write_cr4(cr4 | X86_CR4_TSD);
		} else
			write_cr4(cr4 & ~X86_CR4_TSD);
	}
(Testing TSD in the 'else' path is not worth the trouble.)

The tiny window shouldn't be a problem, should it?  Just what is the
risk to begin with, and how much harder is it to exploit in such a
small window?
