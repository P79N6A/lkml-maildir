This relates to Rik's idea of having a treequota on "/home/students"
which would apply to all students, not any one user.
One issue here is: how do you tell the quota-system what constitutes a
   tree, for quota purposes.
NetworkAppliances have had treequotas on their filer for quite some
time, and I believe that you have to create quota trees explicitly
with "qtree create"
I would rather not have to add such a new command if I can avoid it.
For the above senarios,  I would simply create an accout called "tmp"
or "home" or "mail" (you might have that one already) or "student",
assign a quota to that account, and chown the directory appropriately.
Afterall, there is no real reason why /tmp should be owned by "root".
Any "system" account should be fine.
Can anyone else see a good way to flag an inode as "root-of-a-qtree"
that does not require a new command and does not relate to uids?
