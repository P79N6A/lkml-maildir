OK, the list now reads:
	Each of the following categories of code might need to be
	inspected:
	a.	The low-level interrupt-handing code.
	b.	The realtime process scheduler.
	c.	Any code that disables interrupts.
	d.	Any code that disables preemption.
	e.	Any code that holds a lock, mutex, semaphore, or other
		resource that is needed by the code implementing your
		new feature.
	f.	Any code that manipulates hardware that can stall the
		bus, delay interrupts, or otherwise interfere with
		forward progress.  Note that it is also necessary to
		inspect user-level code that directly manipulates such
		hardware.
I added point "f".  Does that cover it?
						Thanx, Paul
