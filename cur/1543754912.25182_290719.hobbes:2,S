i dont really buy it. Any rwlock-type of locking causes global cacheline
bounces. It can make a positive scalability difference only if the
read-lock hold time is large, at which point RCU could likely have
significantly higher performance. There _may_ be an intermediate locking
pattern that is both long-held but has a higher mix of write-locking
where rwlocks/rwsems may have a performance advantage over RCU or
spinlocks.
Also this is about PREEMPT_RT, mainly aimed towards embedded systems,
and at most aimed towards small (dual-CPU) SMP systems, not the really
big systems.
But, the main argument wrt. PREEMPT_RT stands and is independent of any
scalability properties: rwlocks/rwsems have so bad deterministic
behavior that they are almost impossible to implement in a sane way.
