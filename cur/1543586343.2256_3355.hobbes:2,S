I think that the Solaris one is right.

Select says that the socket is ready for both input and output. A read
results in ENOTCONN, a write results in EPIPE.

Select says that the socket is ready for output, but a write results
in EPIPE.

$ uname -a
OSF1 XXX V4.0 1229 alpha
$ ./a.out
select result=0
