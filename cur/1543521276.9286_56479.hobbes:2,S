So, lesson for the day -- anytime you get a crash in malloc/realloc/free,
do this:
$ env LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/libefence.so whatever_crashed
  ## twiddle thumbs
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
$ gdb whatever_crashed core
> where
Now the gdb traceback will show exactly where the bad code broke the rules.
