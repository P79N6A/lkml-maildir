Andi, if you remove the HLT here, some CPUs will spin at full speed. This
is nasty during boot because some of them might not have enabled their
fans yet for instance and could fry if nobody's looking (eg: live reset
caused by hardware problem). Even if HLT does not work on some CPUs,
the JMP after it will spin around it and the initial goal will be achieved.
