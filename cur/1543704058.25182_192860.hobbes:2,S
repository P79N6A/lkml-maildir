Consider a spammer using your address and spams people.  Say 25000 of those
use this method (Called challenge response authentication protocol).  You'll
get bombarded with 25000 challenge message.
You put the burden on the sender, not the spammer which is pretty much
useless.  There was a discussion about this on exim-users and someone posted
a web page.

I for one refuse to answer those challenges unless I know it was due to a
spammer.  Defeats the purpose.
