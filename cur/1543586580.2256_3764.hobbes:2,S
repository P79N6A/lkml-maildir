System specs:
Pentium 200 MMX
80MB RAM
2 IDE Drives:
SAMSUNG SV0844D 8.4GB
WDC AC21200H 1.2GB
All partitions are ext2 filesytems.
ps xl:
  F   UID   PID  PPID PRI  NI   VSZ  RSS WCHAN  STAT TTY        TIME  COMMAND
040  1000  1230     1   9   0 24320    4 down_w D    ?          0:00  /home/data/mozilla/obj/dist/bin/mozi
[I'm not exactly sure how to get the wait address if it isn't shown above]
Other stuff:
Creative SB AWE64 PnP
16MB Voodoo 3 2000 and a 2MB S3 Virge display
RealTek RTL-8029 NIC
Sony CRX100E Burner
I'm running X in a dual-head configuration using the above 2 cards.
That's all I can think of at this time.
Thanks,
Trevor Nichols.
