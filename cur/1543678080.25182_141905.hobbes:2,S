Serialization is important for the case of a device state change 
occuring rapidly.  An example is a device add and then remove, which 
results in (if out of order) the add occuring after the remove, leaving 
a dead device node in the filesystem.  This is tolerable.  What isn't as 
tolerable is a remove and then an add, where the add occurs out of order 
first.  In this case, a device node should exist on the filesystem, but 
instead doesn't because the remove has come along and removed it.
This occurance does happen much more often then you might think.  When 
changing disk partitions, for example, items are removed and then added 
several times before the devices are finally instantiated.
Definately to be avoided.
