Is there no possible way you can do the memory allocation fully in
userspace? Let userspace allocate shared memory visible to multiple
processes, and pass that into the kernel for it to write to.
If this is as high-speed as you imply, then you *really* don't want to
be doing this on the fly (let alone from inside the kernel). All the
high-bandwidth stuff I've worked on preallocated its buffers, as later
on in the processing there are no hard guarantees as to either how
much memory one can acquire *or* how long it will take to do so.
Either one of those is a deal-breaker when dealing with fast data
rates.

Just send a message down an fd? The wakeup/context-switch is the
expensive part of that, I think, at least when dealing with only a few
dozen fds. Or change it to be level- rather than edge-triggered, to
coalesce the horrific number of events getting crammed down the
processing side.
It sounds like this is the cheapest part of the process, so not worth
the effort of optimizing it as much as finding better ways to do the
rest of it.

Have userspace ask the driver if anyone has allocated it yet, if not,
userspace allocates it and hands the pointer to it back to the driver
so that it can hand it back out to the other calling processes who
also want to subscribe to that data stream.
If another userspace process races with the first trying to ask if a
buffer is available (first asked already, but hasn't yet given the
driver the info), then the driver puts the second process to sleep
until it's ready to hand back the buffer.

Creating chunks on the fly is, I think, an operation that can take an
arbitrary amount of time. If you *really* want to do that, you should
instead just allocate as much as possible in the first place, and then
you do your own memory management on blocks inside of that, never
invoking the kernel's memory services after the initial allocation.

Surely this is just an issue of writing the chunk to free memory?
Either you have the memory available or you don't. If you do, no
problem. If you don't, then you're screwed regardless, as allocating
on the fly is not guaranteed to help you out.
Good luck,
