i don't see how fixing the C file solves this issue.  the header file
<linux/tty_driver.h> clearly refers to "struct ktermios", for which it
won't have a definition unless it includes <asm/termbits.h>.
you can hack a solution by explicitly including the latter first, of
course, but i don't see how that constitutes a proper fix.  or am i
misreading something here?

p.s.  this isn't just theoretical -- this bit me this morning as i was
writing a simple module to flash the keyboard LEDs, just for the
entertainment value.
