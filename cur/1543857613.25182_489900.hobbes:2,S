Hi,
I am having problems reading VCDs under various Linux distros (Fedora Core 6, openSUSE 10.2, Slackware 11 with the 2.6 kernel), and while searching Google for a solution I found that this problem has been mentioned on the LKML list too. (
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/10/29/95
)
I didn't see any responses after the post linked to above, so I'd like to add that I too get this problem and that I've tried with various VCDs and players. In previous versions of these distros I could just mount the VCD and copy the *.DAT files across; but in the current versions I can't even mount! dmesg gets flooded with errors such as the below: 
hdc: command error: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }

Another link on the net (by the same poster as the LKML link above) mentioned that this problem appears *after* kernel 2.6.16. So I downgraded my Slackware kernel to 2.6.16 and sure enough the problem goes away. I haven't tried with the 2.6.19 kernel, so I can't confirm if that solves the problem or not. 
Thanks,
Rakhesh
