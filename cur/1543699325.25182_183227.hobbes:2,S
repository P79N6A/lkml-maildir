Marcelo,
It appears the block-device-cache/kswapd problem is indeed fixed in
2.4.23 (yay!).
To confuse matters RedHat has released an RPM with 2.4.20-24.7 which
apparently contains later patches that include the fix.  This can be
confusing because their 2.4.21-4EL kernel is busted (WRT this bug).
But, at least this way we can simply tell our RH-based customers to go
grab the RPM.
Thanks,
-chris
