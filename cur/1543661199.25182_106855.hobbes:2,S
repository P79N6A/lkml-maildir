Or we could just use Parrot, and be done with it!
Seriously: While Perl's faults may be in the eyes of its beholders, the real
point here is complicating the build environment for the kernel.
As a fundamental piece of portable software, the kernel should build in a
minimal environment. Perl may indeed be a good choice for text munging --
but it is not the only choice, and using it adds yet another requirement to
the kernel build environment.
Minimizing the build environment simple is a valid requirement for selecting
a tool.
