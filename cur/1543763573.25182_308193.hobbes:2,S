OK, that's good. I'll look at whether we can easily use Ingo's
tool on the SMP domain only, to avoid the large O(n^2). That might
be an acceptable short term solution for 2.6.12.
If you get a chance to also look at those block layer patches that
would be good - if they give you a nice improvement, that would
justify getting them into -mm.
