What use is it to me when I'm going to buy ShinyCard-9900, and the database
tells me that RandomChip 2530a is supported? The packages rarely tell you
what chips are in the cards, moreover there have been cases of /very
similar/ card versions (i.e., SomeThing-990 and SomeThing-990+, or
Card-897a and Card-897b) being /totally/ different inside). The only
reliable way to find out if it works is a test drive. Distributions like
Ubuntu are invaluable here.
