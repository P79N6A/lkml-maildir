Amen to this.

Could be done but seems to be very optimistic about the actual
detail. However stuff like flush/power up/power down/operate silent/operate fast
should be indeed generic.

The last part could make the few above possible. But the layering problems
in ide are currently much preventig the most trivial kind of validation.
See for example problems in asynchornous commands, which turned out recently.
