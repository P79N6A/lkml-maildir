ok, this looks mostly good to me - but this definitely should be based 
/ontop/ of the x86_64 GTOD code. I.e. ontop of these patches in -mm:
 generic-vsyscall-gtod-support-for-generic_time.patch
 generic-vsyscall-gtod-support-for-generic_time-tidy.patch
 time-x86_64-hpet_address-cleanup.patch
 revert-x86_64-mm-ignore-long-smi-interrupts-in-clock-calibration.patch
 time-x86_64-split-x86_64-kernel-timec-up.patch
 time-x86_64-split-x86_64-kernel-timec-up-tidy.patch
 time-x86_64-split-x86_64-kernel-timec-up-fix.patch
 reapply-x86_64-mm-ignore-long-smi-interrupts-in-clock-calibration.patch
 time-x86_64-convert-x86_64-to-use-generic_time.patch
 time-x86_64-convert-x86_64-to-use-generic_time-fix.patch
 time-x86_64-convert-x86_64-to-use-generic_time-tidy.patch
 time-x86_64-hpet-fixup-clocksource-changes.patch
 time-x86_64-tsc-fixup-clocksource-changes.patch
 time-x86_64-re-enable-vsyscall-support-for-x86_64.patch
 time-x86_64-re-enable-vsyscall-support-for-x86_64-tidy.patch
also, note that there is a new TSC synchronization check code in -mm as 
well:
 x86-rewrite-smp-tsc-sync-code.patch
this should be ontop of that too. (and ontop of the high-res timers 
queue)
