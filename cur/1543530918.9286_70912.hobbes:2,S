   OK, so you have no numbers to back up your claims. Would you please at
least try to get some? Otherwise there is little point in discussing your
doomesday swap predictions.
   As for the justification of not overcommitting memory, can I assume that
you have heard of the ANSI/ISO C and POSIX standards?

   Not in any way. The application can't read the kernel's mind. The system
has x MB of RAM+swap, the application asks for x+20 MB, the kernel says
"OK". How is the application supposed to know that the kernel is telling a
blatant lie? If you can't trust the kernel, your system is fsck'ed.
