Maybe I miss your point, but clearing is conditional: on timer delete...
I think more suspicious is calling cancel_work_sync() for a delayed work
(with timer pending). Or maybe some race profits from _PENDING cleared
without locking?
BTW, it seems some debugging is needed to show, whose work is doing the
mess.
