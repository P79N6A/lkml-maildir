Whoops, forgot to mention; I have extra printk's in now. At the time
of failure it's generally after  several "psmouse lost syncs" and
resyncs, and finally synaptics driver tries to do synaptics_reconnect
=> synaptics_query_hardware => synaptics_capability =>
synaptics_send_cmd => psmouse_sliced_command which fails (then the
freeze).
