This is a warning only, I have a patch queued up to fix this.  I've
included it below.

That's odd.  I don't think that is related, but it might be.  Can you
try the patch and let me know if it still happens?

Subject: kobjects: mark cleaned up kobjects as unitialized

When I remove only the kvm-intel module without removing the kvm module
itself, I get an error saying that a kobject is trying to be
reinitialized. Its because of the fact that kvm reuses a kobject in
kvm_init when calling sysdev_register.
This patch fixes kobject_cleanup by marking the kobject as uninitialized
when we cleanup to allow kobjects to be reused.
