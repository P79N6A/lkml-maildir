Subject: 2.2.6 - exec.c - CONFIG_BINFMT_MISC inconsistency .

Hi,
This is the final mail on this topici from our side. According to the
response from *Linus* it is a policy to allow root users to override
existing binary formats registered in the kernel via the
CONFIG_BINFMT_MISC interface.
What we are trying to point out is , that this policy is not
consistently followed when the support for CONFIG_BINFMT_MISC is compiled
into the kernel.
When the support is compiled into the kernel , MISC handlers reach the end
of the linked list, hence overriding existing formats is not possible
When the support is compiled as the module , MISC handlers are at the
beginning of the linked list, hence overrides are possible.
To make this consistent we have attached the patch to exec.c , which 
now calls init_misc_binfmt() at the end of the initialisation
sequence hence making sure that if the support for CONFIG_BINFMT_MISC
is compiled into the kernel , the handlers are attached at the beginning
of the linked list , making overrides possible.
This according to us is a viable solution.
Comments ??
