That is because account_system/user_time() is also called from
account_process_vtime() which is called from __switch_to in
power pc. vtime is for virtual time accounting. Enabled by
CONFIG_VIRT_CPU_ACCOUNTING.

idle threads are associated only with the runqueue and not visible
by the do_each_thread()/while_each_thread() loop. They are not added
to the tasklist (please see init_idle() in kernel/sched.c).

While writing/extending the cpuacct container, I found it useful to
know if the container resource group we are controlling is really mounted.
Controllers can try and avoid doing work when not mounted and start
when the subsystem is mounted. Also, without these callbacks, one has no
definite way of checking if the top_container is dummy or for real.
