The old IDE layer does not currently have a maintainer.

The reason I ask is that they put the partition in the last sector which
means a block read of the last sector goes off the end of the disk and
certainly used to be mishandled by the IDE code.

It's a compile time option. If you don't have GPT partitioning support
then the system ought to behave correctly.
