Correct.

'deprecated' and 'obsolete' are very different beasts from the other 
statuses.  They are largely just a marker of opinion of the developer, 
and are largely treated as synonyms.
Code that was never marked deprecated nor obsolete often appears in 
Documentation/feature-removal-schedule.txt, and eventually gets removed.
Feature deprecation and removal is a very amorphous concept that does 
not fit well at all into Kconfig markers, unlike experimental/broken.
