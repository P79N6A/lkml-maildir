Hi,
Here is new version of the hrtimer patches sorted by priority. I dropped 
the remaining time patch, the const patch doesn't produce a larger kernel 
with gcc3 and I also added the acks so far.
I consider the first four patches the most important and the remaining 
patches simple enough, that I think they're still 2.6.16 material.
bye, Roman
