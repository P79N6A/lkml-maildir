Ahh, it's using the default configuration from the linux source, I'm not
sure where it's stored, somewhere in arch/i386... as far as I know.
However, Red Hat stores their version of the .config file in /boot as
config-`uname -r`.  So copy this to your kernel source directory as
.config, then try make oldconfig, etc...
A quick way of doing this... (assuming you are in the kernel source
directory)
# cp /boot/config-`uname -r` .config
Then run...
# make oldconfig
# make xconfig, menuconfig or config	- optional
# make dep bzImage modules modules_install - usual build procedure.
| Is there any command to list all current running linux kernel
configuration which is used to compile that version?
Not in 2.4.x as far as I know, but there is a virtual file in /proc
(/proc/ikconfig or something like that I think) that does this.
