The Coverity checker spotted the following inconsequent NULL checking 
introduced by commit 5d38998ed15b31f524bde9a193d60150af30d916:
<--  snip  -->
...
static int pnp_bus_resume(struct device *dev)
{
...
        if (pnp_dev->protocol && pnp_dev->protocol->resume)
                pnp_dev->protocol->resume(pnp_dev);
        if (pnp_can_write(pnp_dev)) {
...
<--  snip  -->
pnp_can_write(pnp_dev) dereferences pnp_dev->protocol.

        of the darkness. There had been need of rain for many days.
       "Only a promise," Lao Er said.
