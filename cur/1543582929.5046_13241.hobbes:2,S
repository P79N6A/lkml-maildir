You can observe with ps that each thread for each mounted loop device
increases the load by 1; here's the output from "ps ax | fgrep loop" on my
Dell Inspiron 5000e:
   13 ?        DW<    0:28 [loop1]
  115 ?        DW<    0:57 [loop0]
  116 ?        DW<    0:58 [loop2]
 2816 pts/4    S      0:00 fgrep loop
Since I have 3 image files mounted, that means my Inspiron 5000e has a load
of 3 when it's idle... ;)
