Hi,
I am suffering from what a quick Google search has shown
to be the infamous netdev watchdog lock in Rhine NICs,a
although in a somwhat different way from most cases I've
seen reported. Instead of failing under heavy load, my card
(in fact, an onboard chip in the ECS L7VTA-L motherboard)
completely refuses to make a connection under 2.4.x kernels.
I tried all releases between 2.4.18 and current 2.4.21-pre5
to no avail. The driver provided by VIA at their site
fared no better.
I include below a snippet of the syslog (debug=7)when trying
to connect to a DHCP server. I also have a TCP dump of the
dialog, if it's of any use (the messages about promiscuous
mode are caused by tcpdump, I believe).
..(lots of snipped stuff)...

The weird thing is, it seems to work perfectly with
Debian Woody's stock 2.2.20 idepci kernel. I'd be glad
to stick to it for the time being, but I can't get
support for most of the mobo's functionality (it sports
a KT400/VT8235 combo) under any kernel earlier than
2.4.20.
TIA,
Alon
