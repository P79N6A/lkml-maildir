 call sys_rename, sys_pread, sys_create, sys_mknod, sys_rmdir
 etc. - everything that does file access.

 in this case it's an attempt to avoid cutting and pasting
 the entire contents of sys_rename, sys_pread, sys_this,
 sys_that, removing the first couple and last few lines (that
 do copy_from_user) and replacing the arguments with either
 a dentry or a kernel-side char* instead of an __user char*.
 my alternative is to patch every single vfs-related sys_* in fs/*.c to
 be able to "plug in" to these functions.
