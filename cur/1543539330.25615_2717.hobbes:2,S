Agreed, but I don't think that this is the point of RT. 
RT isn't about whether we can or can't do something. If something
can't be done (tech wise), history shows that technology will improve 
until it can. What RT is about is the GUARANTEE that something can or
can't 
be done, based on a set of parameters that are associated with each
task.

Sounds like Bill Clinton :)
