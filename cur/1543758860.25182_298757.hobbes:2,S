There have been extensive discussions on all aspects of this patch.
This issue was discussed in

The cmpxchg will fail if that happens.

These architectures have the atomic pte's not enable. It would require
them to submit a patch to activate atomic pte's for these architectures.

Great!

Nick may have some data. It got far too complicated too fast when I tried
to introduce locking for individual ptes. It required bit
spinlocks for the pte meaning multiple atomic operations. One
would have to check for the lock being active leading to significant code
changes. This would include the arch specific low level fault handers to
update bits, walk the page table etc etc.
