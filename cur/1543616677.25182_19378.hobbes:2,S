The preemptible kernel plus the spinlock cleanup could really take us
far.  Having locked at a lot of the long-held locks in the kernel, I am
confident at least reasonable progress could be made.
Beyond that, yah, we need a better locking construct.  Priority
inversion could be solved with a priority-inheriting mutex, which we can
tackle if and when we want to go that route.  Not now.
I want to lay the groundwork for a better kernel.  The preempt-kernel
patch gives real-world improvements, it provides a smoother user desktop
experience -- just look at the positive feedback.  Most importantly,
however, it provides a framework for superior response with our standard
kernel in its standard programming model.
