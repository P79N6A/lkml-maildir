Well one of the primary reasons we are interested in researching this is 
because we are in the process of preparing to release the SciTech SNAP 
DDK under the GNU GPL license (dual licensed for proprietry developers), 
and want to understand the ramifications of this approach. I must say I 
am surprised to see that such a clause does not exist, since binary only 
modules seem to be pretty abundant in the community.
Then again the whole 'derived works' clause in the GPL is a huge gray 
area IMHO, and even just sitting there arguing with myself I can come up 
with pretty good arguments in both directions for why a binary only 
module is legal or not. Especially when the only reference to this in the 
GNU GPL FAQ is about plugins, and they use a really silly distinction 
about whether a plugin uses fork/exec or not. I mean if you use fork/exec 
to start the plugin, yet the plugin uses RPC and shared memory to 
communicate with the main process, that is the same as local procedure 
calls and local memory IMHO.

Yes of course, but if there is no notice in the file, who is the 
copyright holder? Only the original author knows for sure, and for 
someone to *use* that file without permission from the original author 
would be inviting a lawsuit.

Right, but there are files in the source code with *nothing* at the top. 
No copyright header, not notice of who wrote the file, nothing.
In my opinion, unless a specific source file has a copyright notice 
attached to it and specifically says 'you are licensed to use this file 
under the terms of the GNU GPL - see the COPYING file' etc, then that 
file is *not* under the GNU GPL. What that means is that I would have 
zero rights to use that file without direct permission from the author, 
and realistically should not use it. 
If there are lots of files like that in the Linux kernel, then that means 
that none of us really have the right to use Linux on our machines! 
Yikes. Considering that all GNU projects contain this type of header, I 
have always just assumed the Linux kernel source code would too. 
Especially now with this SCO debacle going on.
