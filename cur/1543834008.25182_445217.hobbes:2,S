No, it would not. A 'continue' instead of the 'goto found' would
compile to nothing.
Try the following example with and without the 'continue'.
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void)
{
        int i, j;
        for (i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
                j = 0;
                do {
                        printf("i==%d, j==%d\n", i, j);
                        j++;
                        /* goto found; */
                        continue;
                } while (j < 2);
        }
}
Continue is equal to:
LOOP {
	/* foo */
	goto continue; /* == continue */
	/* foo */
continue:
} LOOP
