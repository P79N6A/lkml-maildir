This change was necessary because once a cpu goes offline, the worker
threads for that particular cpu, sleep with their state being
TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE. Thus, during CPU_ONLINE, when we call
start_workqueue_thread(), kthread_bind() yells since the worker thread
is not TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE.
Probably later on when Oleg plans to re-introduce the ->should_stop
flag, we can put the worker threads to uninterruptible sleep, and revert 
back to kthread_bind().

Not sure if this is required. set_cpus_allowed() returns a non-zero
value only if the cpumask passed doesn't intersect with the cpu-online
map. In our case, start_workqueue_thread() is called only when the cpu 
is online. i.e
a) __create_workqueue_key() calls start_workqueue_thread() with
get_online_cpus() protection only for those cpus which are online.
b) workqueue_cpu_callback() calls start_workqueue_thread() on event
of a CPU_ONLINE.
