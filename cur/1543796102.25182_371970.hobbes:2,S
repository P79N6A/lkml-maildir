Probably I should have mentioned, how my benchmark should look like:
I have written a little c-program opening several files for reading and
writing. 
The dentry-cache would only play a role the first time, the files are
opened. I'm not quite sure about the inode-cache. 
I check if the page has buffer, and mark them as not uptodate, too. So
the buffer-cache is disabled, too.
I'm using ext2/ext3. I don't think, they use any additional caches.
But anyway: Could you explain your fake-umount idea a little more ?
