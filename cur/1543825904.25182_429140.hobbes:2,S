No.  TSO is not good for bridged virtual networking in general, since 
even if the bridged networking module understood TSO, it would then have 
to split up any large packets into smaller packets to pass on to the 
guest virtual machine - or require that the guest virtual machine have 
and understand how to use a TSO compatible network interface as well.  
Both solutions are extremely problematic, and the easiest thing to do is 
just disable TSO.  It makes sense for any protocol bridge device, 
including some firewall configurations.
