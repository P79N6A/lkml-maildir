No.. not really. Except -ac kernels and kernels with the preempt patch.
I'll just clarify: The problem is not that hard disk operations gets slow (I
can understand *that*, as it's a MW-DMA2 disk and one UDMA33 running ext3),
instead the real problem is that the system as a *whole* gets painfully
slow. Whilst copying a 500MB file, it takes ~6-8 seconds to start a new ssh
session from my windows comp to my linux server, compared to <1 second when
running preempt/ac kernels.
