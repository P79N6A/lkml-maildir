I decored the oops and in short rq_target->idle is NULL, so then
resched_task bugs out while reading p->need_resched.
it's the hyperthreading support that bugs out infact.
I had a look and this should fix it (the first one is just a theorical
bug, since it's under an ifdef i386 cpu_number_map is an identity, the
++ thing was the reason I think). Can you test it?
