You aren't going to get much sympathy here on that one...:)

However, he *does* have a point here - GPL'ed out-of-tree drivers will
have these same issues.  Yes, I know the standard "get them into the tree"
refrain here...

Fortunately, NVidia supplies enough pieces to make things work..

Ingo et al - what *is* the recommended magic to make a driver compile and
work cleanly with or without RT?  Hopefully there's a simple "will work correctly,
but possibly sub-optimal latency" cookbook scheme....

The C preprocessor is your friend - we *should* be able to make a change in one .h
like '#ifdef SOME_RT_FLAG .. #else ... #endif' to do most of the work...
