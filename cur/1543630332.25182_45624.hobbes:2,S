Hi,
For two days, I am constantly observing this error
with both 2.4.19-pre8aa2 and 2.4.9-pre8ac1 on the Athlon SMP
with two 1900+ CPUs running at 1.6GHz with 2GB DDR
registered DRAMs. ASUS A7M266-D with their newest
official BIOS 1.005a.
$ latex fw.tex

As you can observe it here, it happens during LaTeX processing on a
a big file.
I ran this process more than 20 times with 2.4.19-pre6aa1 all successfully.
I believe that there is a problem somewhere with some memory
management stuffs either in -pre7 or in -pre8.
Absolutely no message is recorded in the /var/log/message file.
That is strange.
I have not checked the above kernels on 2.4.19-pre8aa2 and 2.4.19-pre8ac1
compiled for Pentium 4, yet. Before investing further, I think I need
to report about it anyway.
Thank you.
Regards to all kernel developers.
