    (I don't know if you're directly concerned with this part of the
kernel; if not, would you please forward it?  Thanks.)
    I get sporadic "Trying to free free IRQxx" messages in /var/log/messages,
under an i386 2.3.14 kernel.
    2.3.5 had code to avoid the printk that produces these, in free_irq() in
arch/i386/kernel/irq.c:
		for (p = &irq_desc[irq].action; ...
			...
			/* Found it - now free it */
			...
			goto out;
		}
		printk("Trying to free free IRQ%d\n",irq);
	out:
2.3.14 doesn't have the 'goto out' (or the 'out' label).  Is that
an oversight?
