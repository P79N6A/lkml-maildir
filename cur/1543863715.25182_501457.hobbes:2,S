I don't know sysfs functions well but this looks wrong, you're ignoring 
the pos argument completely and always returning the same data. You 
should be copying the data starting at pos and returning only the number 
of bytes available from that point (possibly zero). Otherwise the user 
app will never get an end of file since more data is always available.
Also, you shouldn't be returning EINVAL if they try to read less than 
the size of your data as that is acceptable behavior and will work fine 
if you handle the pos argument properly.
