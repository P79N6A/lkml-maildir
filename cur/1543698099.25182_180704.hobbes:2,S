I'm seeing
- User Interface corruption under X. That shows as random processes
crashing with SIGFPE (interestingly, often two unrelated X processes crash
at the same time -- sometimes one of them is the server) or SEGV, 
I just switched to -test11 and turned off preemption. I don't see any more
crashes or weird behavior, but now performance sucks -- console scrolling
(frame buffer) stalls for seconds, keyboard repeat likewise, and the X
server suddenly decides it wants twice the CPU (60% instead of 30%).
I'll rebuild test11 with preempt and check whether there are any changes.
(Yes I know, changing two variables at the same time was somewhat stupid.)

If you're careful enough, nothing bad or good will ever happen to you.
