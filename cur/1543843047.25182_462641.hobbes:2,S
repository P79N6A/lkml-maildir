It makes no guarantee in any kernel.
In the new tty case however tty_buffer_request_room() will only fail if
you have 64K queued or the box is completely out of atomic memory and
also doing stuff like dropping network packets and console keystrokes.
So all you need in your IRQ handler is
	if (tty_insert_flip_string(tty, buf, size))
		tty_flip_buffer_push(tty);
the rest will occur automatically. Hinting with tty_buffer_request_room
may improve performance for some workloads (notably virtualized uarts)
or when using DMA but otherwise the above should be fine.
Most existing drivers were a straight conversion so at the moment try
too hard.
