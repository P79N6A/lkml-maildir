Will that work with rmap15d?  The code seems to support only min
and borrow parameters.  Correct me if I'm wrong.  This is what it
looks like currently:
# cat /proc/sys/vm/pagecache
1       3       20
# mem | grep Cache
Cached:        4569128 kB
SwapCached:     829668 kB
ActiveCache:    136728 kB

AIX vmtune -P is equivalent to the Linux cache-max, but cache-max
is not implemented.
