I think that if the problem of a single scheduler which is "best" at
everything proves out of reach, perhaps in 2.7 a modular scheduler will
appear, which will allow the user to select the Nick+Con+Ingo
responsiveness, or the default pretty good at everything, or the 4kbit
affinity mask NUMA on steroids solution.
I have faith that Linux will solve this one one way or the other,
probably both.
