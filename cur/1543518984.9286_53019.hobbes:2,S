You seem to imply that a DVD-RAM can be treated like a floptical disk, which
I don't think was your intention. The DVD-RAM still has a severe limit on
write cycles, like CD-RW. Using it for a normal file system, with endless
meta-data updates, would wear the disk out ultra quick.
Does anyone have experience of CD-RW actually reaching the 1000 write cycles
they are specified for? The real lifetime seems much lower, so restricting
the writes is very important. All in all CD-RW seems a pretty flaky
technology.
