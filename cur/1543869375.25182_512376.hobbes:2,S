Try to decrease the initramfs size just to know if it boots correctly.
I.e., put just a sh/bash/ash/dash binary there (probably /dev/console 
node, too), executed in init.
Then, try to start the kernel with initramfs embedded in the kernel, 
then as initrd etc. - this will show if the fault is on your side, or 
kernel's.
