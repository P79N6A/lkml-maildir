Gotta say, I'm not a bit fan of the names of these macros.  They're
disappointingly short on descriptiveness.  ;)  Maybe
MASK_ALL_SINGLE_LONG and MASK_ALL_MULTIPLE_LONG?  Something that more
explicitly shows the difference between them.  So when we're reading
code later on, we're not constantly looking up the definition and
saying, "What's the difference between MASK_ALL1 & MASK_ALL2 again?"
