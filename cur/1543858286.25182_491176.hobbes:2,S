Well as I told in my mails to the list I made the experience that not
all bytes of the corrupted area are invalid,.. but only some,.. while it
seems that in you diff ALL the bytes are wrong, right?

Hmm and do you have any ideas what's the reason for all this? Defect in
the nforce chipset? Or even in the CPU (the Opterons do have integrated
memory controllers).

Hmm maybe,.. but I have absolutely no idea ;)

Yes I can confirm that.

And did you get out anything new?
