I have a Compaq ProLiant 7000 with 3 pci buses numbered 0,4 & 5.  Running
RedHat 5.2 with the 2.2.1 kernel layed on top I can not find any of the
devices that are not on PCI bus 0.  Under the RedHat 5.2 - 2.0.36 kernel I
can find the devices.  I have run out of bus 0 slots and need to expand my
system.  Can you help?
