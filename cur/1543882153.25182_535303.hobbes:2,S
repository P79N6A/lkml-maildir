Perhaps its time for Linus to say he won't accept any patches which are
not Acked and place the onus on getting those on the tree maintainers.
In theory at least tree maintainers are supposed to be responsible for
the stuff coming through their tree.  They could be made responsible to
ensuring only Ack'd stuff is committed.  Automated checks could be made
for that at least.
As for the white space errors.  I think that we should perhaps run a
spectrum of commits from each tree through the checked proposed later in
the thread.  Where any significant non-compliance is detected that
should be sent to the tree maintainer and their 'upstream' and
corrections expected.
Public shaming.  A savaging from Linus' or any other respected community
member is something to be avoided at all costs.
