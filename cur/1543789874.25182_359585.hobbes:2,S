First, thanks for all the help and attention.  I am learning much.
I think the focus of this discussion should be on mprotect.  I 
understand that spec says it only works on mmap'd memory.  So does 
malloc use mmap?  If not why does it work at all?
Probably the most problematic issue, tho, is why does mprotect return 0 
even though it failed to change permissions on the 66th page?
