Are you thinking something like "core VM/scheduler/locking/etc." as one set of
not-quite-so-mini-summit, and a "block IO/storage drivers/filesystems" as another,
"arch maintainers" as another, and "all the nutty drivers and their writers" as
perhaps a fourth?  In other words, some semi-logical grouping of issues
each as more free floating meetings?  Or did I miss your suggestion?
Easy on the judgement on practicality, btw.  For instance, FAST is going
to try to do some part of one of these - possibly larger than a networking
mini-summit in scope but otherwise with similar goals.
I think there are some options to consider for hosting some targetted
working meetings in some of these areas, including the examples already
given for some mini-summits.  Some sponsors might help set up mini-summits
(and some have in the psat), including considering the Linux Foundation as
they do with the Desktop Architects Meeting (my favorite DAM meeting!).
The challenge is to figure out what people want to have happen, the see if
we can make it happen.
