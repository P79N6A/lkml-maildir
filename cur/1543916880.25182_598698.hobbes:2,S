I don't want to be the "nasty" person, but one of my machines doesn't
like 2.6.23-rc8. Infact, 2.6.23-rc1 was the first kernel this is broken.
(I didn't get hands on this machine till now).
Since my other x86-64 machines are doing fine, I am going to blame it
on my machine specific config :)
Thanks,
