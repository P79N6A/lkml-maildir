Does Linux/x86 even have a proper ABI document? I've never seen one.
The closest I've seen would be the SVR4 i386 psABI, but it
deliberately doesn't define the raw syscall interface, only the
each-syscall-is-a-C-function one implemented by the C library,
and that interface doesn't suffer from the current issue.
IOW, the kernel may not be at fault if user-space code invokes int
$0x80 directly and then sees clobbered registers.
