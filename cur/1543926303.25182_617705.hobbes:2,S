Subject: warning, huge 2.6.23-stable review cycle about to start

Ok, I've been slacking on the -stable front for a bit here, and didn't
realize how far behind I've gotten.  Everyone has been sending patches
in, which is great, but now we are facing a HUGE 114 patch release.
As there's no real way that everyone can review all of these patches,
I've decided to split them up into 6 different categories, and will be
sending patches out in these categories for review.  If people can just
glance over the ones in the areas they care about, I would really
appreciate it.
The 6 categories are:
	- core kernel changes
	- arch specific changes
	- networking changes
	- network driver changes
	- non-network driver changes
	- filesystems
Consider this a warning that your inbox is going to be filled up soon,
so everyone can prepare those filters :)
thanks,
greg k-h
