Hi,
I may have stumbled on a small problem.  However, I'm not kernel hacker, 
but things just don't look right.  Appears that the ioctl for RNDGETPOOL
isn't implemented the way <linux/random.h> way you would think.  So the 
end result is if you use the ioctl in the defined way then your program
SIGSEGV's.  Course maybe I'm just reading things right, so I'm coming here.
From <linux/random.h> we have:
/* Get the contents of the entropy pool.  (Superuser only.) */
#define RNDGETPOOL      _IOR( 'R', 0x02, int [2] )
Shouldn't that be returning an integer array with two entries?
But drivers/char/random.c for RNDGETPOOL returns to user space:
                ent_count = random_state.entropy_count;
                if (put_user(ent_count, p++))
                        return -EFAULT;
                        
and                     
                        
                if (copy_to_user(p, random_state.pool, size*sizeof(__u32)))
                        return -EFAULT;
The pool is 128 bytes, per POOLWORDS.  Why isn't POOLWORDS in <linux/random.h>?
So that I a user could check that, make sure they are getting the correct
size.  Is there a problem here?   This was for the 2.2.12 kernel.
