It is important when running benchmark tests such as this to not
have any processes running on the machine (idle machine).  Also,
run the tests several times to ensure the data is constant.

I can test IDE hard disks, and IDE/ATAPI CDROM's, but I can't
test ATAPI CDROMS while the ide-scsi ATAPI-SCSI-EMULATION driver
is being used on my IDE/ATAPI CDROMS.  Other things fail too on
the ide-scsi driver...
