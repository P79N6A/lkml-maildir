I don't think so.
Imagine DVD playback. If you have 2% error, your audio is going to get
1 second off each minute. It is going to be off by one minute at the
end of hour. 2% is probably not acceptable.
[I'm not sure how exactly video/audio synchronization works, besides
fact it does not; but 2% could be huge problem for something like
that.]
