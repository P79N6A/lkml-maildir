I just mean that when  I debug and catch the segv, it's dies because 
some pointers now have corrupted values.  (usually because something is 
overwriting some memory some where)
I'm currently re-writing some code to make it use select() instead of 
epoll_wait() and see if everything is suddently fixed.  If so, then I 
will suspect that epoll has a problem.  But it's still not ruled out 
being my fault since it could be a timing issue that makes the crash 
show up.
