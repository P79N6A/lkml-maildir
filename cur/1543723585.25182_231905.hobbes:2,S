[PATCH] PCI Hotplug: RPAPHP structure size/performance
Please review and apply the following patch if you find it agreeable.
This patch does not make any functional changes, but does improve
both performance and memory usage by rearranging structure elements.
The need for these changes became appearent during a code review of
the disassembly involving this structure. The memory footprint of this
structure is made smaller by grouping the byte fields next to each other.
The access of the list_head can be simplified by making it the first element
of the structure, thus avoiding a needless add-immediate without negatively
impacting any of the other accesses.
