Something like an ERROR report verbose level?  0 to 7 like?
0 being quiet, 7 being very verbose? or the reverse. 
/sys/drivers/system/edac/mc/error_report_verbosity   ????
This tackles the immediate issue, but there is a systemic issue we have
to face sometime.
One problem that this e752x_edac module exhibits, which is manifest on
all of the drivers to one degree, is the output of driver specific error
messages directly, since there is not an abstracted error interface
(yet) in the EDAC core.  The messages are or can be very specific to the
MC being driven.  In time, we can (should) add a better MC error
interface to the core and then map errors from specific MC errors to the
new CORE error interface. Similiar to how SCSI and SATA have higher
level abstract errors which the transport drivers map errors to.
This e752x_edac module just plainly outputs to printk() with
KERN_WARNING w/o any other output control.
Looks like the old "how do we report errors" pattern, with its first
implementation now looking old.
