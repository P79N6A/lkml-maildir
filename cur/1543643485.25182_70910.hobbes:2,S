Seen on specweb - doubling the size of the vmalloc space made it go
away, but without any counters, it was all really just guesswork.
I am also going to implement per-node slabcache on top of vmalloc,
as slabs have to be in permanently mapped KVA, but all ZONE_NORMAL
is on node 0. That's going to put a lot of pressure on the vmalloc
area.
