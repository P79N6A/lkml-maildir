Makes sense at least WRT the "problematic" modules.
include/linux/module.h says:
/* Author, ideally of form NAME <EMAIL>[, NAME <EMAIL>]*[ and NAME <EMAIL>] */
#define MODULE_AUTHOR(_author) MODULE_INFO(author, _author)
I think we should get rid of the "EMAIL" comments:
/* Author, ideally of form FULL NAME [, FULL NAME ]*[ and FULL NAME] */
#define MODULE_AUTHOR(_author) MODULE_INFO(author, _author)
I'd rather let the respective maintainers/authors take care of "their"
MODULE_AUTHOR entries (though the removal seems sane for me personally).
