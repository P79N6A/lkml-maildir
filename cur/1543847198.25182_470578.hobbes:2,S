That's a nice idea.  As Frank pointed out, it does force things into 
register.  You could use "rm" as a constraint, so you can also get the 
location wherever it exists.  It will still force gcc into keeping the 
value around at all, but presumably if its interesting for a mark, its 
interesting to keep:
	asm volatile("..."		\
	    #label "_" #var ": mov %0,%%eax\n"	\
	".previous" : : "rm" (var))
and, aside from the naming issues, it could be a general expression 
rather than a specific variable.
Of course, this requires a more complex addressing mode decoder, but it 
does give gcc more flexibility.  And in principle this is all redundant, 
since DWARF should be able to encode all this too, and if you make use 
of the variable as an asm argument, gcc really should be outputting the 
debug info about it.
