Linus has proudly declared himself to be a non-patch accepting bastard many
times in the past.
This has the interesting side effect of spurring debate and flame wars
about the joys and horrors of
ac-rmap-xfs-O1-devfs-lvm-xfs-lowlat-preempt-blah blah patchsets. This is
a Good Thing(tm).
You should thank Linus for being Linus, and also thank those who
actively maintain alternate branches of the kernel.

If toast always lands butter-side down, and cats always land on
their feet, what happen if you strap toast on the back of a cat
and drop it?
