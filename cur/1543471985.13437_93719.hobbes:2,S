As I am not by any means an expert at parallel programming, my example may
be totally wrong.  I was just thinking that in some cases it would be
non-trivial (or even impossible) for the kernel to determine which
processors to run the threads on to accomplish the task in the shortest
amount of time, particularly when there are more threads in the process
than processors, and most particularly if multithreaded programs are not
recognized as such.  Of course, some kind of mechanism may already exist
to handle this.  I don't know.  Does the kernel do process migration?  If
not, here is what seems to me to be a good example:  two computationally
intensive threads plus one fairly inactive thread.  If the two intensive
threds are scheduled on the same processor, and the inactive one gets to
sit by itself, huge amounds of time could be wasted.  I don't know what
mechanisms would be needed to solve this, but hints to the scheduler might
help.  compatibility could be retained by something like
#ifndef hint
#define hint 0
#endif
or some better scheme.
