What do you know, there was one more in there. Even visible in
the original hunk :-). And this time it wasn't a loop bug (the
crowd goes bezerk).
To the LVM folks: you can't use b_dev or b_blocknr inside your
make_request_fn, it destroys stacking drivers such as loop. And
is just plain wrong in the general case too.
