I agree re: the RT patches, but what makes Con's benchmark useful is
that it also tests interactivity (measuring in msecs vs. usecs) with
everything running SCHED_NORMAL, which is a much better approximation of
a desktop load.  And the numbers do go well up into the range where
people would notice, tens and hundreds of ms.
