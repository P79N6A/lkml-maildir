Subject: [PATCH] sata_mv: improve warnings about Highpoint RocketRAID 23xx cards
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/12/11/156

Improve the existing boot/load time warnings from sata_mv
for Highpoint RocketRAID 23xx cards, based on new knowledge
about where the BIOS likes to overwrite sectors with metadata.
Harmless to us, but very useful for end users.

This should ideally go upstream for 2.6.24.
