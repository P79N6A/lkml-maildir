And on yet another side note Mike, I just did a make -j8 for all make 
options in my makeit script, something I don't normally do, and while 
running 2.6.20.3-rdsl-0.31, building 2.6.21-rc4, the machine remained 
100% responsive, worst case keyboard lag that I observed might have been 
200 or 300 milliseconds.  The machine remained usable, which to me is the 
bottom line.  And no, I wasn't running xmms at the time or watching 
tvtime else I'd have awakened the missus.
I'm having a hard time justifying your continual fussing as its obviously 
a huge improvement to me.  What makes your system and loading so much 
different from mine I wonder...
In the meantime I'm a very happy camper about this patch.
