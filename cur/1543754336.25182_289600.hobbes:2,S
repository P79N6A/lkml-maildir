What systems exist for complex logging and security auditing in the kernel?
For example, let's say I wanted to register my specific code (i.e. a
security module) to log, and adjust to log level N.  I also want another
module to log at log level L, which is lower than N.  I want to print
logs at log level N..+2 and below to the console, but silently log all
log messages >N+2 to the syslog.
Anything?
If there's nothing, I'll write one.  Shouldn't be too hard.
