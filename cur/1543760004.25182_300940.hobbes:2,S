The process may be rescheduled to run on different processor. Then the
add_timer() function (called from schedule_next_timer in
kernel/posix-timers.c) will also add the timer to the new processor
because it is called from the signal handling code. So I think that it
is possible that a periodic timer will be scheduled on different
processors.
