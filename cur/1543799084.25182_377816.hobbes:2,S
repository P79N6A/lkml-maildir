saa7134-alsa is trying to initialize before the ALSA core has initialized.
Probably no one has tested CONFIG_VIDEO_SAA7134=y.
There is some more brokenness there:
1) With CONFIG_VIDEO_SAA7134=y, both saa7134-alsa.o and saa7134-oss.o will
be built into the kernel, but only the first of them has any chance to be
used - the second will stay as dead code.
2) Both saa7134-alsa and saa7134-oss set dmasound_init and dmasound_exit
function pointers to their functions (for handling of saa7134 cards
hotplugged later), but they do not reset these pointers on unload -
therefore if you load one of these modules, then unload it, then try to
hotplug a saa7134-based card (apparently there are CardBus
implementation), you will get oopses.  These assignments in saa7134-alsa
and saa7134-oss also stomp on each other.

-ECHEAPHARDWARE (sadly, boards without EEPROM are too common).
