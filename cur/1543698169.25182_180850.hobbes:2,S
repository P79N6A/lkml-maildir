Is this a problem?

I think magic doesn't belong in partition tables.  I like probing.
Having the same data stored in two places makes things hairy
if you don't know how to resolve inconsistencies.

If you're not interested in work-arounds, why not use LVM?

I don't think it's very difficult, but I agree that tables are nice
and simple.
