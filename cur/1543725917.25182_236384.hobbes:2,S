patch having to get much bigger, the vast majority of the hot spots have
been fixed, and the patch remains quite comprehensible even to someone
with a sketchy knowledge of the kernel.  There is only one issue I can
think of that has not been addressed at all (the PS/2 Caps Lock issue). 
All that seems to remain are tweaks to individual fixes that are already
in the patch.
