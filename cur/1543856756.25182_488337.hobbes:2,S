Very odd.
md_probe is registering a kobject presenting md specific stuff and
that creates a directory called 'md' inside the block device. e.g.
   /sys/block/md0/md
The inode for /sys/block/md0 appear to be non-existent at this point,
which as you are seeing poisoned memory where the inode should be.
This shouldn't happen and I cannot reproduce it.
I notice it says:

Have you tried running memtest86 ??
