Want details?  I've got Six:
1) This three-line kluge works for me.
2) I have two pre-production samples of the same device: one ATAPI, one
USB.  Without my patch my ATAPI device never writes, and for my USB
device I have to volunteer `blockdev --setrw` or `blockdev --setro`
again after each disc insertion.
My patch makes both devices write, but I guess my patch somehow breaks
the devices other people have, else the kernel wouldn't include this
seemingly useless feature of filtering out writes on demand.
3) I think growing to three lines my kluge of a two-line patch deepens,
and thus clarifies the shock we first saw non-newbies express as:

4) At least while I remain a newbie I believe the unanswered non-newbie
explanation:

5) With my patch in place, dmesg reports:

dd of=/dev/scd0 bs=2K if=/dev/zero count=1
See the message pairing?  As yet we have ide-cd pointlessly redundant
with cdrom and sr pointlessly redundant with cdrom.
6) I guessed the to/cc list here after reviewing:
grep -i sr MAINTAINERS
grep @ drivers/scsi/sr.c

P.S. Me digesting those six details produced my initial summary post:
"I say, as yet, `blockdev --setrw /dev/scd$n` does not work as well as
`blockdev --setrw /dev/hd$v`."
"Do you agree?"
"Do you agree we (e.g. I) should fix that?"
