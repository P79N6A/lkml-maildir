Subject: [patch] flushpage SMP race with ll_rw_block/bdflush
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

After we wait_on_buffer() inside flushpage, if the bh is dirty, bdflush
can still start I/O over the buffer that is going to be invalidated.
Suppose this scenario:
	CPU0			CPU1
	----			----
	flushpage
	wait_on_buffer
	"not locked so
	return immediatly"
				bdflush notice the buffer dirty and start
				ll_rw_block over it
	mark_buffer_clean
	refile_the_buffer (bdflush
	released the lru_lock
	before starting the I/O)
	...
	clear_bit(Mapped ....)
				make_request()
				buffer not mapped -> BUG()
I think moving wait_on_buffer() after mark_clean_buffer() will make sure
that we'll look if the buffer is locked only once we'll be sure that
nobody can start I/O on the buffer anymore.
This because make_request will giveup when it will notice that the buffer
is clean. So even if we'll check the locked bit too early then ll_rw_block
will do nothing once the buffer is marked clean.
We must be still very careful to not remove the Mapped bit though,
otherwise make_request may still BUG().
this patch against 2.3.16 should fix the SMP race:

I removed also the atomic_dec/inc since they are useless.
