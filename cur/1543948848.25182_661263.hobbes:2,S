Good question.  Actually, we -normally- have pinned tasks in the top cpuset,
where the top cpuset allows all CPUs, but the pinned task has a cpus_allowed
(in its task struct) of just one or a few CPUs (for node pinning.)
So ... could we allow moving pinned threads to any cpuset that allowed
the CPUs to which it was pinned (my cpus_subset() test, above), but
-not- change the pinned tasks cpus_allowed in its task struct, keeping
it pinned to just the same one or few CPUs?

I don't think that the cpus_equal() check prevents that (shrinking a
pinned tasks cpuset out from under it.)  Try the following on a freshly
booted system with your proposed patch:
  mkdir /dev/cpuset
  mount -t cpuset cpuset /dev/cpuset
  cd /dev/cpuset
  mkdir a
  cp ???s a
  < tasks sed -un -e p -e 10q > a/tasks
I'll wager you just moved a few pinned tasks into cpuset 'a'.  This
would be allowed, as 'a' has the same cpus as the top cpuset.  But then
one could shrink a (if it had more than 1 CPU in the first place), leaving
some pinned tasks in a cpuset they weren't allowed to run in, essentially
unpinning them.

Good point - "BOUND" as the past tense of "BIND".  How about
PF_THREAD_BIND ;)?
