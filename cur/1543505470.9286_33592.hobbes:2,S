Subject: 2.3.13 pci_namedevice compile error

I get the following error when compiling 2.3.13:
drivers/pci/pci.a(pci.o): In function `pci_scan_bus':
pci.o(.text.init+0x261): undefined reference to `pci_namedevice'
make: *** [vmlinux] Error 1
I also got the infamous error under one configuration:
ncr53c8xx.c: In function `pci_get_base_address':
ncr53c8xx.c:9636: structure has no member named `base_address'
smbfs doesn't compile, but I understand that is still broken, so I'm not
worried.
