well or do it the other way around
write a counter to such a thing
and kill when it hits zero
(similar to the CPU perf counter stuff on x86)
doing this from userspace is tricky; what if the task dies of natural
causes and the pid gets reused, between the time the userspace app reads
the value and the time it decides the time is up and time for a kill....
(and on a busy server that can be quite a bit of time)
