Greetings;
I turned off the acpi stuffs now and it boots, including with the 
advansys driver built in.  Someone asked me to check 
/proc/interrupts, which gave me a clue that I should enable an ESCD 
update in the bios.  This moved some interrupts around and it seems 
all is well, I'm running it, with X, on my gforce2 card right now.
However, this has the side effect of disabling a 'shutdown -h now' 
which only reboots the machine instead of doing the shutdown.
Also, my oss-install for 3.9.7k fails so I have no sound, not even a 
console beep.  On going to www.opensound.com, I do not find a 2.6.x 
compatible version.
Where is the info to make alsa work (it didn't work with this chipset 
a year ago) now?
