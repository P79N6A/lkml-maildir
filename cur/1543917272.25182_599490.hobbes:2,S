you repeat your point of "emulating yield", and i can only repeat my 
point that you should please read this:
    
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/9/19/357
because, once you read that, i think you'll agree with me that what you 
say is simply not possible in a sane way at this stage. We went through 
a number of yield implementations already and each will change behavior 
for _some_ category of apps. So right now we offer two implementations, 
and the default was chosen empirically to minimize the amount of 
complaints. (but it's not possible to eliminate them altogether, for the 
reasons outlined above - hence the switch.)
