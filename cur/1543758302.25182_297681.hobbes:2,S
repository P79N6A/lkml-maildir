I have a buddy who encountered the "ulimit" confusion,
when he and his team deployed Linux as the platform for a multi-user online programming test competition system.
And generally, i think the kernel/system shall work as it said(return of syscalls/output of commands) :)
But rss limit might be a historical issue, with already many applications depending on it :(
