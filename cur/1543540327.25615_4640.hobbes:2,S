Hello!
Some programs (namely GNU GRUB) don't compile with linux-2.4.0-test5. It
turns out that the following two-liner can only be compiled without
optimization:
================
#include <string.h>
#include <linux/fs.h>
================
Indeed, if we look into /usr/include/bits/string.h (glibc-2.1.3, i386) we
can see that some string functions (notably strpbrk) expand to hairy
macros when __OPTIMIZATION__ is enabled.
I don't want to argue whether it is good or bad, but the fact is that
GLIBC doesn't tolerate redeclarations of some functions.
I must admit that the kernel is wrong here. It declares functions
available exclusively to the kernel code even if __KERNEL__ is not
defined.
The following patch is proposed. More radical solutions (i.e. widening the
area surrounded by ifdef..endif) are left to the exersize for more radical
developers :-)
