There are two ways to do it: 
either duplicate the entry point in entry_64.S and set different
vectors or let the asm glue jump through a call vector (use 
apicinterrupt ...,*thermal_vector(%rip) ) Later is probably better.

The patch that was in git-x86 didn't build on 32bit. Perhaps it was a 
32bit config file? Run it under "linux32" or equivalent on your distro.

PCI locks are spinlocks so they don't need process context. In PREEMPT-RT
kernels they can sleep, but there the handler will be likely already
a thread. Touching config space from interrupt context is legal, although
not very popular because it tends to be slow (but a few drivers do it)

Please add

Otherwise I can just see the support questions of people asking why this
doesn't work for them.
Anyways I'm unsure about the blacklist here -- white list would
probably have been better. k8_northbridges[] will certainly include
Griffin northtbridges and who knows if TT will work there or not.
[sorry for mentioning that not earlier]
