We thought about that. While it's possible to do that, it would need hooks 
into all filesystems etc. Definitely worth trying once we get some more basic 
stuff working for ext3
After all the things that need to be saved at the time of taking a checkpoint 
for any filesystem would be the superblock and inode table (or their 
equivalents). Everything else is automatically taken care of.
