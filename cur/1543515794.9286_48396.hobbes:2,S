It's quite simple to connect Linux non-rt processes to RT tasks and
handlers in RTLinux. In fact, the entire purpose of RTLinux is to make
the "unix system" accessible to the RT layer.
However, we do not do what Solaris and other operating systems do, which
is "integrate" the realtime into the rest of the kernel by slowing down
the rest of the kernel and making the realtime part not realtime.
