This born from the initial epoll implementation, that was using the size 
parameter to size the hash. Since now epoll uses rbtrees, the parameter is 
no more used. Changing the API to remove it, and break userspace, was/is 
not a good idea.

Yes, it is nicer if epoll behaves like poll. (*)

The epoll_wait() wait loop is the standard one that even poll() uses (prep 
wait, make interruptible, test signals, sched timeo). So if poll() is woke 
up, so should epoll_wait(). A minimal code snippet that proves poll() 
behing woke up, and epoll_wait() not, would help.

This should be moved in "[RFC] something else" ;)
