I added that back in Patch 17/25 "Mlocked Pages are
non-reclaimable" [before nonreclaimable became unevictable".  I did this
because "lru_add_drain_all()" was only used by numa code prior to this,
and was under #ifdef CONFIG_NUMA".  I called lru_add_drain_all() from
__mlock_vma_pages_range() [since removed] and I wanted the
nonreclaimable/unevictable mlocked pages feature to be independent of
numa.  So, I had to ensure that we defined the function for
nonreclaimable/unevictable lru as well as numa.
Now it appears that hotplug and memcg also depend on
lru_add_drain_all(), so making it depend on 'SMP looks reasonable to me.
