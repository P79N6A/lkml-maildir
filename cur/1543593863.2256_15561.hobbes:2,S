I've put this driver on my web page at :
http://phaedra.apana.org.au/johna
This is not an attempt to do anything "official", merely point out 
that it's there so that anyone wanting to develop a driver for a serial
type chip (or use that chip) has the option of a driver to start with.
I'm not aware of any such web pages at present. Let me know if there's
a more comprehensive one, I'll retract my driver, no point in cluttering
the web.
If anyone has ideas about where else to announce out this web page, I'm
happy to listen.
I previously tried posting to this list via a newsgroup - email gateway,
but suspect it was not able to post to this list.  I'm not on the list,
but should be able to see responses on this gateway.
Cheers,
