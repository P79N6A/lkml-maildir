Gotcha. Not having control in fbcon? Understandable. I don't think vgacon has 
that control in it, and see no reason for it to be in fbcon either.

Now this is a good reason to put the binding/unbinding control in another 
place. I had already thought that re-initializing vgacon on an error 
condition would be the best way to get the message to the screen. Having the 
console binding/unbinding code in a generic layer will make this very easy.

Thanks Tony. I'll get my nose back into drmcon and see if I can't get it into 
shape soon myself.
