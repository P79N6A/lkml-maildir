Hmm.. Looks like page->mapping was cleared by truncate_inode_pages()
when the inode was free'd, and there was still write-back activity on
one of the pages in question. 
Looking at the problem, it appears that the unmap() will (correctly) do
a writepage() for each dirty page, and that will (again correctly) cause
NFS to do a delayed write-out with all the proper things (increment page
count because of the pending write etc). The inode hasn't been free'd
yet, because we're still using it.
But then when we _do_ release the inode, we end up doing
truncate_inode_pages() and through that we clear page->mapping, so the
pending write-out is SOL.  I have this feeling that we probably should
NOT remove the mapping until the page count has gone down to zero. 
The other alternative would be to flush the pending write-outs (or wait
for them synchronously - but that's just stupid and inefficient), which
would imply that we'd better add the "flush" operation to "struct
address_space_operations". 
Can you get a full stack trace?
