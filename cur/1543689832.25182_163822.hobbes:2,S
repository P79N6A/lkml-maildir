This is not an issue for tapes, etc. NFS has an alternative mechanisms
for dealing with this in the form of the NFSERR_JUKEBOX error.
However for disks I agree that you do have 'large' variations between
the cached and uncached case. Should latency really be much larger
than 1/10 second for a 32k read though?

If it was merely a case of random error, then we wouldn't have a
problem at all. The RTT code does make an estimate of the error on the
the measurement. The problem is that there is a large tail in the
graph of round trip time vs. number of events due to these disk
spinups, etc...
However retransmissions compensate somewhat because they impose a
geometric increase in the timeout value. i.e. The for the first
transmission the timeout == the rto, then the retransmissions follow
2*rto, 4*rto, 8*rto,...
Part of the problem in the Linux case is therefore that we have a too
low default value for 'retrans'. The kernel default is '5' (same as
for Solaris, however the mount program still overrides that default
with a value of '3'. This implies that for soft mounts, we never wait
longer than 15*rto before we time out (well - 7*rto actually since the
code in xdr_adjust_timeout() actually appears to confuse number of
retransmissions with the number of transmissions).
By setting 'retrans=6' (5 + 1 to compensate for the bug), therefore,
people can ensure that we retry for at least 6 seconds before timing
out. The question is: is this an adequate default?
Cheers,
