Okay, what about this one:
You merge xen hooks in mainline, but keep maintaining arch/xen
out-of-tree? You have to maintain it yourself, anyway, and having
hooks merged should make it easy.
When xen is merged into i386 (you said that is your long-term goal
anyway), you can merge that into mainline...
