Hi, NFS/VFS gurus
nfs_access_cache_shrinker() calls igrab() without serialized with
umount process, looks that might cause the "busy inode" after umount,
doesn't it?
I think we need to serialize the generic_shutdown_super() and
nfs_access_cache_shrinker() just like the dcache/icache shrinker, am I
understanding right?
Thanks
