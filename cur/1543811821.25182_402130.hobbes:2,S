Ok, something is definately broken in this kernel.
If I launch Eclipse (
http://www.eclipse.org/
) while running a
2.6.16-rc5-mm1 kernel it loads for a second or two and then the box
just locks up solid.
I then went back to my previous kernel, 2.6.16-rc4-mm2, and there's no
problem what-so-ever when running that kernel (everything else
identical) - eclipse loads and runs just fine.
Since I'm in X when the lockup happens and I don't have enough time
from clicking the eclipse icon to the box locks up to make a switch to
a text console I don't know if an Oops or similar is dumped to the
console (there's nothing in the locks after a reboot)  :-(
Unfortunately I don't have a second box to use with serial console or
netconsole, but I'll see if I can somehow get some console messages -
perhaps by slowing down the eclipse load process somehow... I'll see
what I can do and report back when I have more into.
If all else fails and noone on LKML can suggest patches to try and
revert or similar I guess I'll eventually do a git bisect, but I'd
rather try other things first...
The version of Eclipse I'm running is 3.1.2
The problem is completely reproducible (well, at least it occoured 6
times in a row and that's how many times I tried).
Sorry for the lack of detail, but I thought I'd better report the
issue at once and then follow up with details later :)
