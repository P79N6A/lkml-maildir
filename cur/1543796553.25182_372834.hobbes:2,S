I don't know the exact specs of NFS v2 and v3, but I doubt they can have
single files larger than 2TB.  Even if they could then this is not a
very common situation and if someone is running in such an environment
then they can easily enable CONFIG_LBD (or make e.g. CONFIG_NFS_V4 have
a dependency to enable this if it is important enough).  What I'd rather
avoid is needless growth of heavily-used structures for rather uncommon
cases (at the current time at least, this can be re-examined later).
It might also be possible to have a separate CONFIG_LSF (or whatever)
that enables support for large single files, maybe enabled by default
with CONFIG_LBD and also configurable separately for clients of network
filesystems with large single files.  Someone who cares more about the
proliferation of configuration options than I can decide whether it
makes sense to keep these as separate options.
Cheers, Andreas
