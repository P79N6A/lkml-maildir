But importantly, doing it that way means you share test coverage with
the CPU TLB flushing code, and you don't introduce a new concept to the
VM.
So, it _has_ to be lazy flushing, IMO (as there doesn't seem to be a
good reason otherwise). mprotect shouldn't really be a special case,
because it still has to flush the CPU tlbs as well when restricting
access.
