Argh! it should be V4L1 instead!

Some of the above drivers are V4L2, like tda9887, tuner-core,
tuner-simple, msp3400, cs53l32a, tveeprom, wm87xx. Maybe they are just
including the wrong headers. We should try to change to videodev2.h and
see what happens with all those drivers. The ones that break should me
marked with the proper requirement on Kconfig. 
Some of they need some #ifdef inside. For example, compat_ioctl32 should
handle both APIs, since it is a generic code to fix 32 bit calls to 64
bit kernel.

The idea is that V4L2 drivers should need to include only videodev2,
when V4L1 compat is not defined.

So, we need to fix it. May you work on such patch?

Yes. There is just *one* ioctl that should be done driver by driver, for
buffer allocation on V4L1 model.
