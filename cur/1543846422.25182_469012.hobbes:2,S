Hi Andrew
We are going to use this in the Linux UWB project; is it
possible/makes it sense to get it in?
> lib/bitmap.c:bitmap_parse() is a library function that received as input a
>  user buffer. This seemed to have originated from the way the write_proc
> function of the /proc filesystem operates.
>
> This function will be useful for other uses as well; for example, taking
> input  for /sysfs instead of /proc, so it was changed to accept kernel
> buffers. We have this use for the Linux UWB project, as part as the
> upcoming bandwidth allocator code.

> Only a few routines used this function and they were changed too.
