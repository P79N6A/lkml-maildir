Still, if we do that, we won't need to acquire dev->sem in device_pm_remove()
any more.  Apart from this, by acqiring pm_sleep_rwsem for reading in
device_del() we can prevent a suspend from starting while the device is being
removed.
Consider, for example, the scenario possible with the $subject patch:
- device_del() starts and notices pm_sleep_rwsem unlocked, so the warning is
  not printed
- it proceeds and everything before device_pm_remove() succeeds
- now, device_suspend() is called and locks dev->sem
- device_del() calls device_pm_remove() and blocks on that with the device
  partialy removed
I think we should prevent this from happening.
