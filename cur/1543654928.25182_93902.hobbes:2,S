Possibly because of the "do it in open(2)" rule?
Ignoring the device model entirely, if a driver does a lot of 
talking-to-the-hardware in its probe phase, I consider it buggy, in 2.4 
or 2.5.
The network driver and chardev ones typically follow this rule quite 
well... probe is simple, just registering interfaces with the kernel. 
dev->open is where the driver should (and usually does) power-up the 
hardware, [re-]initialize it, etc.
So each time you come upon a driver that wants dev->driver->start(), 
look closely at the code and wonder why it can't perform the 
dev->driver->start() code in its interface's dev->open member.
