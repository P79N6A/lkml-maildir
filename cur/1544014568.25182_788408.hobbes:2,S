Hello!
Suspend fails on Lenovo X200 with
  - 2.6.28-next-20090107-ikn
  - 2.6.28-ikn-06859-gede6f5a
When doing echo mem > /sys/power/state, the
"Suspending consoles..." message appears, the "moon" is blinking,
but the system stays in this state (waited 10 minutes) forever.
At least -next is broken for a longer time (see previous posts on
linux-next).
Now the -wl tree also gained a suspend problem:
With
  - 2.6.28-rc9-wl-ikn-24949-ge98df74
I can suspend (!) and even wake up, but the display is black
(xorg and console) with some strange drawn columns.
Tha last known working version is
  - 2.6.28-rc9-wl-denkbrett-24896-gf4f5c96
Can somebody fix that so upgrading and testing
to a newer kernel is possible again?
Sincerly,
Nico
P.S.: -ikn or -denkbrett is just the hostname; kernels are not patched,
      directly fetched via git.
