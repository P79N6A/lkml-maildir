Right, I missed that.

Right again,
$ git clone \
http://www.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/mason/btrfs-unstable-standalone.git
fails here after a few objects with
Cannot obtain needed blob ca442d313d86dc67e0a2e5d584b465bd382cbf5c
while processing commit 96dd95de14c77309abd2521d06c4825162b85e0a.
fatal: Fetch failed.
Chris, you should enable fetching over http by
$ cd /pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/mason/btrfs-unstable-standalone.git
$ cp -p hooks/post-update.sample hooks/post-update
Also run git-update-server-info unless you are pushing something soon
again anyway.
Cloning a full kernel repo over http may be too unreliable, but cloning
a smaller repo like the btrfs standalone repo should work acceptably
over http.
