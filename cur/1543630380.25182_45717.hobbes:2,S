Well, ACPI calls them "segments" but a previous discussion (c.f. "RFC:
Changes for PCI" from a year ago) called them domains.
I don't care what they're called, but I wanted to bring them up and see what
everyone thought about how best to implement them, or at least if anyone had
an objection to adding a "segment" parameter to pci_scan_root.
I certainly don't have a machine that uses these but some people do, and it
sounds like it would be nice to handle them in an arch-neutral way.
