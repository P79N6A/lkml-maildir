I am using Gentoo (and it is custom build of linux, actually only busybox + 
kernel + uclibc and few other tools), hdparm is vanilla 7.7
I will try to compile now -rc2 to see if there any changes.
With 16MB 2.6.24-rc1 works fine, 1GB working also with some errors in dmesg. 
And IF that all is important, cause it is relatively old hardware and 
probably if it is only this hardware-specific bug, it is enough to issue 
workaround just to be able to use it. I dont think so someone using them now 
much, but IMHO things must work in kernel if they are there.
