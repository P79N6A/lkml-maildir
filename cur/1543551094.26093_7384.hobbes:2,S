Ted,
Here are some corrections to the published list.
I'm working on new additions now.
~Randy
> 6. In Progress
> 
>      * USB: hotplug (PNP) and module autoloader support
+ Move to "1. Should Be Fixed".  We want more testing of it, of course.
> 9. To Do
> 
>      * USB: OHCI root-hub-timer does not restart on resume {CRITICAL}
>        (Paul Mackerras)
+ Move to "1. Should be Fixed".
>      * USB: add bandwidth allocation support to usb-uhci HCD
+ Move to "1. Should be Fixed".
>      * USB: Fix differences in UHCI and OHCI HCD behaviors/semantics:
>           + Only uhci.c does EARLY_COMPLETE (drop EARLY_COMPLETE ?)
+ Move to "Fixed" (actually deleted).
>      * USB: usb-ohci needs to null urb->dev to avoid various
>        reboots/hangs/oopses {CRITICAL} (David Brownell;
>        david-b@pacbell.net)
+ Move to "1. Should be Fixed".
> 10. To Do But Non Showstopper
> 
>      * USB: speed up device enumeration (hub driver has large 
> delays in it)
+ Move to "1. Should be Fixed".
Other updates from linux-usb-devel people?
Thanks,
~Randy
