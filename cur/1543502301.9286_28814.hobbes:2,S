Yep, BeOS is an excellent OS that has a correctly puts together
a C++ GUI Object Oriented system with compound document support that
has never dropped out a chunk of audio in my use of it.
The GUI is certainly much better than kfm or any other file manager
that adheres to traditional Unix methodologies.
It's very fast microkernel base system that has real-time support
for media streaming for those that don't know about it.
It's even got some Self-ism with the use of replicants for document
persistence.
It's just about he most responsive GUI OS I've ever used, which
runs count to various folkes mischaracterizations of microkernel
based technologies.
It's excellent.
