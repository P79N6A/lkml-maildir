Andreas patch has a much more serious problem: it changes accepted UNIX
semantics. Try this before and after the patch:
#include <unistd.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <sys/mman.h>
#define PAGE_SIZE 4096
int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
        int fd;
        char * map;
        fd = open("/tmp/duh", O_RDWR | O_CREAT, 0666);
        if (fd < 0)
                exit(1);
        ftruncate(fd, PAGE_SIZE);
        map = mmap(NULL, PAGE_SIZE*2, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED, fd, 0);
        *(volatile char *)(map+PAGE_SIZE);
        return 0;
}
and see the difference..
I have tried to fix this _correctly_ in 2.3.10-pre2. That fix could be
back-ported to 2.2.x, but Andreas patch really is not acceptable.
And Andrea, I told you this once already in private email. I told you why.
Why don't you listen? "Fixing" a bug badly is worse than leaving it as a
known bug.
