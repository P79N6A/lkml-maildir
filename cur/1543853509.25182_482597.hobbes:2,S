Hi,
I'm experimenting with NETLINK_ROUTE socket on 2.6.16 (patched with
mipl - mobile ipv6 for linux), in order to monitor the state of the
arp table.
On kernel 2.6.8, when an entry was - even manually - added or deleted,
a RTM_NEWNEIGH message was sent to the multicast group RTMGRP_NEIGH,
which I'm listening to. On 2.6.16, no such message is sent, except for
IPv6 events.
I compiled 2.6.16 with CONFIG_ARPD and set
"/proc/sys/net/ipv4/neigh/*/app_solicit" to a value > 0, but no luck.
I know there exists NETLINK_ARPD, but it should be used to manage, not
monitor, the arp table (it doesn't support multicast, anyway), if I'm
not wrong. Any suggestion is welcome.
Please CC me, since I did not subscribed the mailing list.
Thank you,
Carlo Bellettini
