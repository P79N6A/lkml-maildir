with "/bin/tar -f - >/tmp/test/", you ask bash to open the file "/tmp/test/"
for write, then start tar and pass this file as its stdout. Obviously this
is wrong. I think that what you're trying to do is send extracted files to
/tmp/test, which is what '-C' is for. Also, you need to specify a command
for tar. You didn't. I bet if you do the following, it will work :
[root@coyote data]# dd if=00010.coyote._lib.1 bs=32k skip=1 |
    /bin/gzip -dc |  /bin/tar -C /tmp/test/ -xf -
Now, Gene, this is becoming totally off-topic right here.
