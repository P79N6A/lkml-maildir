I have VIA KT133 no raid and I'm happily running RH 7.2 with their
stock kernel. I previously had issues that turned out to be a bad 30G
IBM DeathStar but upgraded the BIOS and did a little torture testing
out of paranoia (tried copying ~150MB files across two drives (not the
bad IBM one, they replaced it)) and I never had a problem since.
