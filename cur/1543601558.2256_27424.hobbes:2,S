moderately loaded (mainly used as workstations) I can say that in _my_ own
setup and hardware, memory management in 2.4.9-ac10 feels much better than
2.4.9's. In 2.4.9-ac10 I've been using:
echo "1" > /proc/sys/vm/page_aging_tactic
and the result is a much better behavior of the system. Now, with the same
applications loaded, daily cron doesn't force all of my appliactions into
swap (something 2.4.9 did). Now swap usage is much lower, the system seems
to have a faster response to user interaction than before and "swapoff" is
_much_ (maybe x10) faster than in 2.4.9.
It seems that we are getting closer to a production-quality kernel :)
