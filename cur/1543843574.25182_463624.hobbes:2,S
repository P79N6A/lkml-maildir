Subject: [PATCH] ext3 sequential read regression fix
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

ext3-get-blocks support caused ~20% degrade in Sequential read
performance (tiobench). Problem is with marking the buffer boundary
so IO can be submitted right away. Here is the patch to fix it.
2.6.18-rc6:
-----------
# ./iotest
1048576+0 records in
1048576+0 records out
4294967296 bytes (4.3 GB) copied, 75.2726 seconds, 57.1 MB/s
real    1m15.285s
user    0m0.276s
sys     0m3.884s
2.6.18-rc6 + fix:
-----------------
[root@elm3a241 ~]# ./iotest
1048576+0 records in
1048576+0 records out
4294967296 bytes (4.3 GB) copied, 62.9356 seconds, 68.2 MB/s
The boundary block check in ext3_get_blocks_handle needs to be adjusted
against the count of blocks mapped in this call, now that it can map
more than one block.
