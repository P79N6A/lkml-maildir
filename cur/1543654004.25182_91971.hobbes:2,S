Given the fact HT6552IR is a (very old?) ISA Super IO chip with:
    * Support two serial ports.
      Support one printer port with EPP/ECP/SPP function.
    *Parallel Port and Serial Port IO Base Address Select: 
      378, 278, 3BC, 358, 258, 398, 298, 3F8, 2F8, 3E8,
      2E8, 35C, 25C, 2BC, 39C, 29C
    * Seven IRQ selectable (IRQ 3,4,5,7,10,11,12)
    * All port is designed for disable and enable.
it surely is 8250 compatible.
As you have two 8port regions for two serial ports these should be the 
correct locations.
