Your first statement doesn't make sense.
We don't debug binary kernels by themselves - we debug them with source.
Binary drivers that come without source are almost impossible to debug.
If we can't debug the drivers, we'll soon have a Linux community
that's full of broken drivers.
If broken binary-only drivers becomes significant for many users,
Linux will become much less fun - and it may harm its adoption and
improvment.
Some would say the problem of binary-only drivers is already
significantly harming the development process: think of the people
running 2.4-only drivers who cannot be involved in 2.6 testing or
development.
Also the rate at which new open source drivers are produced will
decrease, because there will be less useful source for authors to
learn from.
