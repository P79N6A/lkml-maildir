Well, the information actually is there already, although I have to admit 
that it's kind of subtle. 
Look at the current mpage_end_io_read(), and realize that it already does 
a traversal in pages from
	start = bio->bi_io_vec
	end = bio->bi_io_vec + bio->bi_vcnt - 1
which is actually very close to what it would do with partial results.
With partial results, it would need to do only a slightly different 
traversal:
	end = bio->bi_io_vec + bio->bi_vcnt*PAGE_SIZE - bio->bi_size
	start = end - nr_sectors * 512
	PAGE_ALIGN(start)
	PAGE_ALIGN(end)
but it's otherwise the exact same code (doing all the edge calculations in 
bytes, and then only traversing pages that have now been fully done and 
weren't fully done last time).
It _looks_ like it literally needs just a few lines of changes.
So I would actually argue against adding new information: we _do_ actually 
have the information already, and adding more "convenient" forms of it 
adds more aliasing and coherency issues. The current form isn't _that_ 
complicated to use, and we might hide it behind a simple macro:
	#define GET_PAGE_INDEXES(bio, start, end) \
		... set start/end to point into the ...
		... proper bio->bi_io_vec subarray  ...

I do think we might make the read-ahead window configurable, and make slow 
devices have slightly smaller windows. 
On the other hand, I don't think the 64kB IO actually _hurts_ per se, as 
long as it doesn't delay the stuff we care about.
