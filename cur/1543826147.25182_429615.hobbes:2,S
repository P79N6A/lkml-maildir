I don't think this is true.  On-going maintenance of a driver is quite
minor over time, unless you are adding new support, or if there are bugs
in your driver.  We will gladly accept any driver, as long as it follows
the proper coding style rules and plays nice with the rest of the
kernel.

Almost always, the person doing the API change fixes all in-kernel
versions of the api change.  So the driver author/maintainer does not
have to fix up anything.

I disagree, quilt is _much_ easier for maintaining patches against a
common tree.  Combined with ketchup and it makes things dirt simple.
Everything else looks good, very nice job.
