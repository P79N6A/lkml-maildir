no, c, d, and e all would reference /a/b's *inode*, not *pathname*. 
Then /a/b would reference /a.  So with the above mv, you just change the 
reference in /a/b (now /b/b) to point to /b as parent.
Only way you would have to touch c, d, and e is if you did:
mkdir /b/b
mv /a/b/* /b/b/
but, since you're also essentially unlinking them from /a/b and linking 
them into /b, it's not that much more of a performance hit to update one 
pointer in the file.
