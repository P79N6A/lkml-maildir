Hi!
I have compiled the kernel with make menuconfig, make bzImage, modules,
modules_install, and installed rusty's latest compatible modprobe util,
but moduls won't load, modprobe xx says modprobe.dep not found. With
insmod, I can load modules, but I'd like that the kernel do it
automatically such as in 2.4. In kernel config, the neccessary options
for this are set. What am I missing, or how has the kernel configuration
changed? By the way, does anybody has a working patch for the binary
3123 drivers? Thx.
Paco
