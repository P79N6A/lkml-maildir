Subject: [PATCH 1/2] VmLib wrapped: executable brk
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/11/28/17

In some cases /proc/<pid>/status shows VmLib: 42949..... kB.
If READ_IMPLIES_EXEC then the break area is VM_EXEC, but omitted from
exec_vm since do_brk contains no __vm_stat_account call.  Later munmaps
count its pages out of exec_vm, hence (exec_vm - VmExe) can go negative.
do_brk is right not to call __vm_stat_account, its pages shouldn't need
to be counted.  What's wrong is that __vm_stat_account is counting all
the VM_EXEC pages, whereas (to mimic 2.4 and earlier 2.6) it should be
leaving VM_WRITE areas and non-vm_file areas out of exec_vm.
VmLib may still appear larger than before - where a READ_IMPLIES_EXEC
personality makes what was a readonly mapping of a file now executable
e.g. /usr/lib/locale stuff.  And a program which mprotects its own text
as writable will appear with wrapped VmLib: sorry, but while it's worth
showing ordinary programs as ordinary, it's not worth much effort to
avoid showing odd ones as odd.
