This sounds good, until you realise that some of us have been sitting
on about 30 patches for at least the last month, because we where
following your guidelines about the -rc's.  Things like adding support
for new ARM machines and other devices, dynamic tick support for ARM,
etc.
If I'm going to have to sit on this stuff for another month, it'll bit
rot rather badly, and I might as well throw away all these patches now
and ask people not to send stuff other than pure bug fixes.
A slightly bigger problem is that I'm in the middle of merging a large
chunk of these for you right now, and at least Andrew has already pulled
some of these from my BK repo.
If we are going to do this, can we start it post 2.6.12 please?
