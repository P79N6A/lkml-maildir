So existing code compiled against this will be using the new 'struct
termios' but the old TCGETS. Should we rename the existing ioctl to 
TCGETS_OLD, and have TCGETS be the new one?
I suppose to a large extent it doesn't really matter as long as existing
C libraries happen to get it right -- and since the new structure only
has the new field added, the discrepancy shouldn't matter _too_ much.
But still...
