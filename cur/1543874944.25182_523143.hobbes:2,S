Will do.

I was a little reluctant to use recursion, but this use parallels another,
existing such use in cpuset.c  The depth of the recursion is only the depth of
the cpuset hierarchy, which is set up by an administrator, and which is
logically limited by the number of cpus in the system.  e.g. it would be
hard to even deliberately organize 16 cpus into a hierarchy greater
than 16 layers deep, even if you wanted cpusets of single cpus.
We've not run into such a problem on systems of hundreds of cpus.
I would think it's safe.  What do you think?
Dinakar's solution is not written yet, as far as I know.  I'll copy him
for his status.
