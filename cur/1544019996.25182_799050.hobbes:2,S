Subject: [BUG] physmap_flash_probe() frees memory still in use
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

as i reported earlier in this month
(
http://lkml.org/lkml/2009/1/12/141
) MTD partition names are screwed
up in 2.6.29-rcX.
commit 176bf2e0f10ecf1d20a97db3bd5bb2e6ba0b5668 deals with a memory
leak and frees the pointer array of mtd_partition after the call to
add_mtd_partitions(). the problem is that mtd_table[x]->name still
points to the freed memory.

               For to be free is not merely to cast off
               one's chains, but to live in a way that
              respects and enhances the freedom of others
