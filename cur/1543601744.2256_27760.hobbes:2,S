Sorry if this is a really stupid questions, but did you install the new 
kernel and boot into it after recompiling?
If you compiled NTFS as a module did you also "make modules" and "make 
modules_install"? Did you try to load the ntfs module manually?
Does /proc/filesystems list ntfs as an available filesystem?
If all of the above are ok, can you copy out the EXACT error message you 
get when you try the mount?
