I'm aware of the window, but did not realize that it could cause high
latency spikes. Is that still the case with 2.6 where we have higher HZ
(1000)? Anyway, I think it's a cheap way of removing such spikes.

Okay we'll remove local_irq_enable() at entry. So in that case we can
remove the local_irq_enable() below as well?
static void poll_idle (void)
{
	int oldval;
=>	local_irq_enable();
	/*
	 * Deal with another CPU just having chosen a thread to
	 * run here:
	 */
	oldval = test_and_clear_thread_flag(TIF_NEED_RESCHED);
...
Thanks,
Jun
