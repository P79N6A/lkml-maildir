Uh? What that'd help? All the communication proceeds OK, up to proper
registration of the input device, but the keyboard seems to stay in a
'disabled' state. The keyboard, not the controller, because if it were
the controller, atkbd.c wouldn't get the 'fa' responses back via
functioning interrupts.
Wiktor, can you try atkbd.dumbkbd=1?
