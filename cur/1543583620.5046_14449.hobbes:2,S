Hi,
I have a kernel panic with the patch 2.2.19pre16 that I test. I use a 2.2.18
Kernel very well. I used the last patch on this kernel and make my kernel
with sames parameters without error message. At the boot, I can see this :
...
eth0: RealTek RTL8139 Fast Ethernet at 0xa800, IRQ 10, 00:50:fc:0b:60:70
eth1: RealTek RTL8139 Fast Ethernet at 0xac00, IRQ 11, 00:50:fc:1f:c1:98
Partition check:
 hda: hda1 hda2 < hda5 hda6 hda7 hda8 hda9 hda10 >
Trying to vfree() noexistent vm area (c00f0000)
VFS: Mounted root (ext2 filesystem) readonly.
Freeing unused kernel memory: 68k freed
Kernel panic: No init found. Try passing init= option to kernel.
I tried to start with init=3 but no change. I send this information on this
mailing list because I think that could be a bug. Sorry if it is a wrong
action of me...
With Regards,
Stephane Garin
