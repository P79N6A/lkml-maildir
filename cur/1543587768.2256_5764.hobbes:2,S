Ah, yes.. I seem to have misplaced a bit of text in my reply.
The continuation of thought:
How the application derives the status of a wrapped counter or
a zero'ed counter is dependant on the device being monitored.
Yes, you have to know what your interface is capable of (maxbytes/sec)
so that you can do a simple calculation where:
maximum_throughput = maxbytes_sec * (time_now - time_last_read)
and if your previous good counter + the maximum throughput wraps the
counter, you have a good chance that you've simply wrapped.
If not, then you can assume that your counters were cleared at some point,
log the data you've got, and keep moving forward.
