Not quite.
I've got one set of users that I care about their processes never dying
root, ..., and another set that I don't.
I want them to contend for real RAM as normal - it's quite acceptible to 
me for users in the second group to push root/...s web-proxy, screen 
session, processes far into slow local swap. Most of these processes 
will be not very interactive - but I don't want them to die.
If the fast (but unreliable) swap device dies - I'm quite happy for my 
firefox and mplayer processes to die - but not my window manager or 
whatever. RSS limits don't address this.
The only way I can think of to address this is to somehow segregate swap 
devices.
