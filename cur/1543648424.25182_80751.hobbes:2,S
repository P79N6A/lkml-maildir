	I know that it works :-) I just refrained from using it because it is
not the designed purpose for this field, as per what the author stated to me,
so I didn't wanted to use in a way that could change under my feet in the
future when Al decided to do some change in seq_file.
	But if Al changes his mind and state that this is valid use, great,
I'll happily use it.
	See my other post with Al's comments.
