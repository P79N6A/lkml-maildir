The periodical choice is mostly down to the brain damaged choice of NMI
as the viable alternative, which is as good as 'not usable'

Agreed but then the BIOS must provide that service to the OS reliably
and efficiently so that users can build that service into their system
wide error management and control processes.

Actually I am dubious that the error handler can do that. If the OS
kernel just issued the first half of a config cycle what occurs when the
SMI tries to play with PCI config space ?
