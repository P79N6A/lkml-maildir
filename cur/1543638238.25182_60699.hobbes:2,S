Subject: [bug, 2.5.29, IDE] partition table corruption?

using 2.5.29 (vanilla or BK-curr) i cannot use /sbin/lilo anymore to
update the partition table.
if i do it then the partition table gets corrupted and the system does not
boot - it stops at 'LI'. (iirc meaning that the second-stage loader does
not load?) Using a recovery CD fixes the problem, so it's only the
partition info that got trashed, not the filesystem.
i use IDE disks.
this makes development under 2.5.29 quite inconvenient - i have to boot
back into another kernel whenever loading a new kernel.
