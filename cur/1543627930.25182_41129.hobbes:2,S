You are missing the point.  There are several macros that use
__ex_table.  Unless it can be guaranteed that no current or future use
of *any* of those macros will be in an __init section then we must not
assume that the exception table is sorted.
Exception table is not the only one that is assumed to be sorted,
get8_unaligned_check is not the only macro that uses __ex_table.  Both
are examples of tables and code where we assume, but do not validate, a
sorted table.
