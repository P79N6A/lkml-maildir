Because it's not that hard to put the kernel onto read-only media or in
a flash chip to which you physically cut the Vpen line.
One solution is just to disallow modules altogether -- but that isn't
really ideal in a number of cases. Allowing only certain _known_ modules
is a more functional solution.
