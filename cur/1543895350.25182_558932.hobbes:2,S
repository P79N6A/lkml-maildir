Every server I run is like that, but if something is important enough I
can remote control a robot over to push the button for me (actually, I
think they implement this under the hood by having a human read the
ticket I submit and go push the button for me manually, but that could
be my imagination.  So long as the button gets pushed the black box is
functioning)
