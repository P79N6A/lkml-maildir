Not much a bug report but when I boot 2.4.20-pre3 I only get as far as
this :
Linux NET4.0 for Linux 2.4
Based upon Swansea University Computer Society NET3.039
Initializing RT netlink socket
Just hangs there no OOPs or anything. Please let me know any info you
might need like hardware or .config options. 2.4.20-pre2 is fine with 
same .config, etc.
