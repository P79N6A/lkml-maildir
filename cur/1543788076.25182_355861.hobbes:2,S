Any results not based on actual measurement are called "guesses" rather 
than "data." Such deep knowlege is useful to determine what to measure, 
not what you would measure if you thought it were necessary.
The measurements are very useful, in that they show the magnitude of the 
performance impact using a benchmark which was constructed to emulate 
certain real world loads. Since no one number or even series of numbers 
can fully describe what *will* happen, but these numbers show what 
*could* happen.

For some applications the issue isn't how fast the O/S runs, but if it 
is secure enough to be run at all. Given the speed of even commodity 
computers, it's probable that even a 2:1 slowdown would still result in 
useful operation, compared to doing the work without a computer.
I can't speak for Linus' thinking of course, but I have worked in secure 
environments before, both DOD and DOE, and information control is vital.
