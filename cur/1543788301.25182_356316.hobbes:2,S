Then I'd propose that we wait for the next "settle down" period with the
split and apply all of the bugfixes and cleanups now.
I don't think we'll gain anything by splitting the files immediately and
there are some cleanups not in-line with the split (eg. the Nigel's patch
eliminating the references to PG_reserved).
Greetings,
Rafael
