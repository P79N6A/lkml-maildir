Hi Pilippe
Last time I tried oprofile with call graph on my opteron machine (linux-2.6.13 
SMP), the machine crashed instantly in dump_backtrace()
Apparently the user program was in a state were 'struct frame_head * head' was 
  not part of the user thread stack, but some strange value like 
0x8000000000xxyyzz
