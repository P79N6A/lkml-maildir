And this is any different than allow malformed data-phase services to
block devices be the default because people at claiming igorance than to
listen to facts?  Sorry Ted, but this is worse than a missed drive timing.
Basically the old down side is that people bitch and moan and claim that I
do not know everything and scream at a minor mistake while ignoring 1940's
FATMAN in their face.
You want it defaulted to always then we do so in the defconfig.
Until people begin believing me again, the only think I can do is give
them options.
