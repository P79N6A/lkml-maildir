Hello Monchi,
thanks for your report!

A new saa7146 subsystem was added plus all device drivers and frontend 
drivers have been improved. It's possible that something was broken in 
the migration.
I'll try and reproduce your crash. In the meantime, you could use the 
"dvb-kernel" tree from the linuxtv.org CVS, patch your 2.5 kernel with 
it (via the "makelinks" script") and try to compile with the new drivers.

One note: you should send your bug-reports at least with a CC to the 
linux-dvb kernel mailing list, otherwise the DVB folks might miss it.
