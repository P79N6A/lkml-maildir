Strictly speaking, urandom doesn't "make up" any entropy - it generates
a pseudorandom stream of bits of arbitrary length using a small chunk of
entropy from the entropy pool.  That's why it's able to generate multi-megabyte
streams of bits even when the entropy pool is empty - it is generating a
fixed but unpredictable stream based on the initial entropy.
The distinction is important mostly to cryptographers - for almost all
practical uses, the pseudorandom stream of bits produced by urandom
is quite sufficient, much faster, and leaves the entropy pool untouched
for those applications that *do* care about the difference....
