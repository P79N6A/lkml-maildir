That's a "rational" number (or alternately, an algebraic number of order 1.
Irrational numbers result from algebraic expressions but aren't representable
as a ratio (for instance, the square root of 2, or the number phi - both of
these are algebraic numbers of order 2).   Trancendentals are numbers which
can't result from algebraic expressions with whole number coefficients (for
instance, pi and e).
All transcendentals are irrational, but not all irrationals are transcendental.
