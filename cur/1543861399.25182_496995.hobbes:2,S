2.4 was designed for gcc 2.95.3 and supports gcc up to 3.4 on all platforms,
and up to 4.1 on x86, x86_64, ppc and sparc64. Recent gcc 3.4 produces good
code on 2.4, and is able to efficiently optimize for size (-Os) without too
much speed compromise.

Hmm, I think you did it the *hard* way. Gcc has been supporting
multi-version for years. You just have to compile it with --suffix=-3.4
or --suffix=4.1 to have a whole collection of gcc versions on your host.
If you don't want to recompile gcc, simply rename the binaries and you're
OK. When you build, you only have to do :
  $ make bzImage modules CC=gcc-3.4
I've been using it like this for years without problem. It's really
convenient, and it also allows you to easily compare output codes and
sizes between compilers.
