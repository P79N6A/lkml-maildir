Hi all,
two questions I simply cannot find answered. On a EM64T capable machine with > 4GB RAM:
1. Should using x86 vs. x86-64 make a difference for block device IO, because more data can be carried at a time?
2. I can use the RAM through PAE, but single processes are limited to a 4GB virtual address space. Now can the kernel itself use more than 4GB at once for the buffer cache?
Thanks!
Matthias
