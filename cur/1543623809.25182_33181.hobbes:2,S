I gave it second thought...
We *must* write to swapfiles during suspend. Doing it during resume
should be very similar to writing during suspend....
If you simply comment it out, it will refuse to suspend second
time. If you comment out even "SWAP-FILE" check, it should work... I'd
be very interested if it helps, but it would also confuse me a lot.
