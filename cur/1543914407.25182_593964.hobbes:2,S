For some reason I was not able to use git, but I still wanna get the
latest kernel source tree as I hope to submit a patch, hence I am now
about to do the things like this:
-download kernel 2.6.22.6 as this is the latest stable version
-and download patch-2.6.23-rc6.bz2 and decompressed it
-apply patch-2.6.23-rc6 against 2.6.22.6 source tree
Is this reasonable?
Thanks
Regards
Frank
