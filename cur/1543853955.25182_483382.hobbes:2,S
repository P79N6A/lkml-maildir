Hi,
Is there any method either kernel or user level which tells me which
process is generating how much traffic from a machine. For example if
some process is flooding the network, then I would like to know which
process (PID ideally), is generating the most traffic.
I dont require it to do this remotely, it should be run on the same
machine as that originates the traffic, additionally last time when I
asked a similar question people answered with stap modules, but I'm
using kernel 2.4.26 and I can't get SystemTap to compile on the system
with glibc-2.3.6.
Any help will be highly appreciated
Regards
Irfan
