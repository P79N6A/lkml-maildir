Subject: [PATCHSETS] KVM device passthrough support with AMD IOMMU
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi,
the two patchsets posted as reply to this email implement KVM device
passthrough support for AMD IOMMU hardware.
The first patchset is version 3 of the generic iommu api patchset which
generalizes the VT-d functions exported to KVM into a common api where
the AMD IOMMU code can plug into.
The second patchset finally implements the KVM device passthrough
support in the AMD IOMMU code. Together with KVM-79 I successfully
passed an 10GBit network card into an KVM guest.
These two patchsets apply in order in top of the latest post of
Han Weidong's Multiple device assignement support patches. Anybody who
wants to try this out can pull the whole stuff from
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/joro/linux-2.6-iommu.git kvm-amd-iommu
Please give these patches a good review.
Thanks,
Joerg
