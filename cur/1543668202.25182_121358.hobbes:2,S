Subject: Root image spanning multiple floppies broken?

Just tried loading a root fs image spanning five disks on 2.4.21-pre6
and 2.4.20, and it fails.
The first disk loads OK, but the second disk is accessed only briefly,
and then the prompt for disk three appears.  If you _don't_ switch
disks, the second disk, (which is actually the first disk, obviously),
is read correctly.
This happens on at least two machines here.
John.
