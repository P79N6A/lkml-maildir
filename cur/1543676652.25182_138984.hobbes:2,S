Last I looked, we had a good example in the Buslogic SCSI driver.
However, just in case it's been changed, I submit herewith an
example of real code written by a "professional".

#include<stdio.h>
#define SuccessfulReturnValue 0
typedef int MainReturnType;
typedef int DefaultCounterType;
typedef void NothingWeCareAbout;
typedef const char StringThatIsntGoingToBeModified;
typedef char StringThatCanBeModified;
MainReturnType main(NothingWeCareAbout);
StringThatIsntGoingToBeModified MessageToBeWrittenToTheScreen[]={0x48,0x64,0x6e,0x6f,0x6b,0x25,0x71,0x68,0x7a,0x65,0x6e,0x2a,0x0c};
MainReturnType main(){
    StringThatCanBeModified LocalStringBuffer[sizeof(MessageToBeWrittenToTheScreen)];
    DefaultCounterType CharacterCounter;
    for(CharacterCounter=0;CharacterCounter<sizeof(MessageToBeWrittenToTheScreen);CharacterCounter++)
        LocalStringBuffer[CharacterCounter]=MessageToBeWrittenToTheScreen[CharacterCounter]^CharacterCounter;
    puts(LocalStringBuffer);
    return SuccessfulReturnValue;
}
Cheers,
