And who is /dev/fb1? You must change your configuration...

It is feature. Secondary head does not have any blanking, it just
repeats
last 64bits (last memory fetch cycle) again and again through whole
vertical
blanking interval (try 'setterm -bgcolor red' and you'll see). There are
two possible workarounds:
(1) create screen with width = 648 instead of 640 (it must be visible
width!)
    and fill this column with black.
    This brokes too many apps because of they expect that they can
horizontally
    scroll for vxres - xres pixels :-( 
    This is what Windows drivers do.
(2) create screen with height = 481 instead of 480 and fill this line
with
    black. Unfortunately, you cannot use virtual scrolling then :-(
So I decided just to live with it... You can just try 'fbset -yres 481
-vyres 481'
- it should implement (2).

You are not using 'video=scrollback:0', do you? You should... There were
some
changes in console_lock recently, maybe that someone now forgets to grab
lock
when doing scrolling/putcs?
