Subject: XFS and ACLs in 2.4.25...what happen?

I just pulled down kernel 2.4.25 yesterday, thinking I could 
finally move away from a kernel with a separately-maintained XFS 
patchset.  I then went and grabbed the combined ACL/EA patchset 
from acl.bestbits.at and applied it (applying some chunks by 
hand).
Then I went into menuconfig and started choosing options, only to 
discover that there's no checkbox for CONFIG_XFS_POSIX_ACL, no 
listing for it in Configure.help, and no reference to it (even 
commented) in the resulting .config file.  There are still 
#ifdef hooks for it in the fs/xfs stuff though, and there are 
"Extended attributes" for both ext2 and ext3 (as there should 
be)--just none for XFS.  I see no patches to correct this at 
oss.sgi.com either...
So what gives?  What happened to XFS ACL support?
