Hello,
  I realise this may be a little off topic but I think the kernel is the
only
place I will be able to pull this stunt.
I need a block of memory that can notify me or even a flag set when
it has been written to. I was thinking of letting the user code generate
some sort of page fault... Any random thoughts would be greatly
appreciated.
mmm ... Basically dirty page logic for user space....
