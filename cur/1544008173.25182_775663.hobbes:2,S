Can you build with debug info and find out which line is the offending
one?

Hmmm... this means blk_add_timer() is being called after the request
is already completed.  All the problem discovered till now have to do
with timeout going off without the low level driver knowing about the
request.  I don't have much idea and it'll probably be best to trace
what's going on using blktrace or printks.  Maybe this is caused by
list corruption as with the first issue or request completion races
with requeueing?
