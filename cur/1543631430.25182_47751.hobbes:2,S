I have 40 wires cable. When ide=nodma is passed to 2.5.17 kernel - kernel boots.
Am I correct that it is not possible to have DMA on with such cable?
Is there any reason for doing that?
Note that bus speed is 33 MHz when kernel fails to boot. I mean - how do I specify slower bus speed: 22 MHz?
Thanks.
Lena.
