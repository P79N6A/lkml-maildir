The VGA problems were due to (X, not kernel!) driver bugs.  Recent
versions of X are thought to be OK.
It's the exact same issue described in this paper, scroll down to
section 4.5.

There's absolutely nothing the kernel or PREEMPT_RT can do about this,
AFAICT even RTAI would be affected, because X lets userspace drivers
talk directly to the hardware including wedging the PCI bus.
