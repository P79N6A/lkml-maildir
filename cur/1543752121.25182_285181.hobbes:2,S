Please consider replacing with the following patch:
Description: Use msleep()/ssleep() instead of pg_sleep() to guarantee
the task delays as expected. TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE is used in the original code,
however there is no check on the return values / for signals, thus I believe
TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE (and hence msleep()) is more appropriate. Change pg_sleep()
to use TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE as well.
