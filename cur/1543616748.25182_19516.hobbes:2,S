Sorry I can't follow you. First, one can sleep while waiting for the
semaphore _and_ while holding it. Second we use atomic ops (e.g. for
resource management) exactly because there are not protected by any
semaphore/spinlock.

There is no priority problem! If there is a more important task to run,
the less important one simply has to wait, but it will still get its
time. Your deadlock situation does not exists. The average time a
process has to wait for a lower priority process might be increased, but
the worst case behaviour is still the same.
The problem that does exist is the coarse time slice accounting, which
is easier to exploit with the preempt kernel, but it's not a new
problem. On the other hand it's a solvable problem, which requires no
priority inversion.

As long as the scheduler isn't changed, this isn't true and as I said
there are latency problems which preempting can't solve, but it will
automatically take care of the rest.

Feel free, I'm not a big believer in the economics of software companies
in general, anyway.

Everyone has its motivation and I do respect that, but I'm getting
suspicious as soon as money is involved. If people disagree, they can
still get along nicely and do their thing independently. But if they
have to make a living by getting a share of a cake, it usually only
works as long as there is enough cake, otherwise it can get nasty very
quickly (and usually there is never enough cake).
