I'm all in favor of a userspace fix.  I suggested a patch
to glibc to fix this.  Ulrich rejected it; I'm trying
to coax out of him how he thinks profiling of multithreaded
programs on Linux should be fixed.
I hope we can all at least agree that
  cc foo.c -pg -pthread
  ./a.out
  gprof a.out
should work in Linux without any workarounds on the part of the programmer...
