It's been a while since I have used your patches. The one question I
have is whether they are compatible with the -ac patches released by
Alan Cox or whether they apply only to Vanilla 2.2.5.
	If they are touching the same areas that Alan's does (I've yet to
check) , then perhaps some warning could be given like "Against -ac?" or
as in Alan's "linux.vanilla" or whatever clear indication you feel
appropriate.
	I've noticed -dj? from Dave Jones which someone complained about
recently as uncoordinated and a confusing proliferation in patch
sources.
