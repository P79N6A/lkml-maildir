but the problem here, is just what you're describing.
The DTMF decoder is finding DTMF signals in normal speech, so talking 
with someone with Asterisk (dot org) using isdn4linux is a true 
nightmare. Linux's DTMF detector finds DTMF signals all the time, 
making asterisk signal them as sounds.
so - we DO NOT need a 'simplistic' DTMF decoder. not for this purpose, 
that is
