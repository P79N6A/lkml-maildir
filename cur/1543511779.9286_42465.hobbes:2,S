You'll probably not like the fact that the offending word usage
has increased in 2.3.x.
[root@djk-dev src]# rgrep -r -i fuck linux-2.2.12/* | wc -l
     30
[root@djk-dev src]# rgrep -r -i fuck linux-2.3.19/* | wc -l
     31
So by the same reasoning, are you going to stop reading
the source code too?
Though I do agree that profanity-free documentation is probably a
good thing to have. Would Microsoft (Or any other OS vendor) issue
documentation to the effect of
	"Click the icon in f*cking control panel"..?

Dave.
