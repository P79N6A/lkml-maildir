bzImage stands for "big zipped Image". Zipped, in this case, means that it
is gzipped. Perhaps Linus never wants to support other compression formats
for the kernel.
Sure "bz2bzImage" is a bit ugly. I personally would prefer bzImage.bz2,
although it is some kind of self-extracting executable, thus *.bz2 is also
not correct. But it would imply better which sort of compression you are
using. But that also means that the standard kernel has to be called
"bzImage.gz". I did not want to mess up the standard names...
But the question is: who is responsible for all those naming conventions?
Does anyone has an idea?
Have fun,
