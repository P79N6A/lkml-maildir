No, my publically released patches add support for Cyrix *and*
AMD. The AMD parts were based on Alans patch. Alan quickly hacked in
the AMD support, but it's not intended to go into Linus' kernel. It's
so that Alan can spped up his FB on his AMD machine ;-)
My patch restructures the MTRR support to make it easier to support
different vendors, and I've taken in patches which add the actual code
for AMD and Cyrix.
