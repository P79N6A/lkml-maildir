The following options come to mind:
1. Keep the msg buffer, but make it smaller.  Around 120 bytes would probably be
big enough for the vast majority of messages.  (printk() uses a 1024-byte buffer,
but it's static -- see #2.)
2. Use a big, static buffer, protected by a spinlock.  printk() does this.
3. Do the whole thing in a macro, as in previous proposals.  The size of the macro
expansion could be reduced somewhat by doing the encode-prefix step in a function --
something like:
#define netdev_printk(sevlevel, netdev, msglevel, format, arg...)	\
do {									\
if (NETIF_MSG_##msglevel == NETIF_MSG_ALL || ((netdev)->msg_enable & NETIF_MSG_##msglevel)) {	\
	char pfx[40];							\
	printk(sevlevel "%s: " format , make_netdev_msg_prefix(pfx, netdev) , ## arg);	\
}} while (0)
This would make your code bigger, but not that much bigger for the common case where
the msglevel is omitted (and the 'if(...)' is optimized out).
