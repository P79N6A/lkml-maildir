| Btw, couldn't the module/non-module issue be solved like this:
| 
| int module_do_blah(struct blah *blah, didel_t dei)
| #ifdef __MODULE__
| {
| 	locking_code();
| 	pure_module_do_blah(blah, dei)
| 	unlocking_code();
| }
| 
| int pure_module_do_blah(struct blah *blah, didel_t dei)
| #endif /* __MODULE__ */
| 
| Just an idea...
Other than a thought that the locking_code() might be a non-trivial
effort to get right if preempt and smp are present, I like it. I guess
efficient is not a big concern for module ins/rm since it's not likely
to be a high rate issue.
I might write the un/lock code as a macro rather than use the ifdef, but
that's a style thing.
