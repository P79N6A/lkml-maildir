hi,
how should patch actually interpret the follwing lines of
the kernelpatches? (I get errors with the 2nd one...):
-- Some video cards have problems with Accelerated X 4.1
\ No newline at end of file
+- Some video cards have problems with Accelerated X 4.1                 
the error looks like:
--------------------------
Patching file Documentation/video4linux/bttv/PROBLEMS using Plan A...
Hunk #1 succeeded at 17.
patch: **** malformed patch at line 3843: \ No newline at end of file          
  
???

frank
