well we have no automated way to do so
as we are underpowered in terms of bug nrs, it is
routine to ask to file upstream. the debian kernel
does not carry any x86 specific patch.
also it is often much easier if upstream speaks directly
with the person that has the hardware at hand.

sure, ack.
so i'll circumvent bugzilla and add the new x86 maintainers
on cc to let them know about the 2.6.24 and 2.6.25-rc1 boot error
on shiny fujitsu p700 lifebook, with a Crusoe processor.
