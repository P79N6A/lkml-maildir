It's optimal to allocate buffers when they are needed.
Thnk about an NTFS volume without any compressed files at all.
CPU hotswap higlights the fact that per CPU allocation needs to be smarter 
about doing its job (i.e. don't allocate if it won't be used ever,
defer allocation to CPU hotswap event).
OTOH, smarter code is longer, more difficult code. One have to weigh
memory benefits for small population of 'hot swappers'
versus code simplicity.
