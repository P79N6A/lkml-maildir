Hey, this one-line patch (I diffed it against 2.4.17-rc2) defines the
ARPHRD_IEEE80211_PRISM arp type.
A little background.  The prism2 series of wireless ethernet cards are
capable of operating in true promiscious mode, capturing raw 802.11
frames.  When it's doing this, the driver prepends a special monitoring
header onto the packet with useful information. 
Since the v0.1.6 release of the driver, this was handled via NETLINK
broadcasts.. but that's Bad(tm).  Instead, the next version (0.1.14) of
the driver will support raw capture using the PF_PACKET interface, which
means that it'll need its own arp type for libpcap to recognize and
handle the special headers.  (without the header, it sends standard
ARPHRD_IEEE80211 frames) 
libpcap/ethereal/etc already have dissectors for this special header, so
all that's left is to define a fixed arp type.
So, I humbly submit this patch for inclusion.
Thanks!
