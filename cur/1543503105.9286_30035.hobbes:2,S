Hi. 
sorry if it already answered, but i didnt find the answer in the faq or
elsewhere. 
after reading the list for some time, i still be a bit confised:
to compile the kernel i should use gcc 2.7.2.3 (and it actually works
perfectly so far for me, but i still be using libc5). 
the original config of the kernel tarball (2.2.*) (ie, Linus config, i
guess), shows the Unix98 pty, and this need glibc 2.1, but they do not
compile with gcc 2.7.2.3 (egcc is recomended). 
so, the question is: 1)what version of libc is in use by developers (which
one Linus uses :-)? and  2) what is compiled by what?
thanks, dmitry
