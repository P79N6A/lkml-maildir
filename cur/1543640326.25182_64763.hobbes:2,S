? so how is cdrecord (or whatever) supposed to do its stuff -- is it ioctl()  
-> fcntl()? If so, I suppose that's ok, but the basic premise still exists,

I don't think modules are the answer to any of this:
 a) some people want basically module-less kernels
 b) in some environments, you need to be able to select the IO mechanism 
    without the ability to select the module to load.
