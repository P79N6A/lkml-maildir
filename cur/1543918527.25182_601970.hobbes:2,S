Ah, yes, for those that is indeed easily doable.

Correct, they would not.

Ah, but its correct to have since we compare against dirty_thresh, which
is defined to be a unit of nr_dirty + nr_unstable + nr_writeback. if we
take one of these out, then we get an undefined amount of space extra.

for my swapping over network thingies I need to put a bound on the
amount of outgoing traffic in flight because that bounds the amount of
memory consumed by the sending side.

It need not be global, it could be per BDI as well, but yes.
