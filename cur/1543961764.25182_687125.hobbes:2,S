[OT to the actual problem]
I have envisioned something like a "requires tag" that
would list what a config symbols needs.
Like in this case it would have been:
	requires V4L
This should in the frontends then if the user selects a symbol
where the 'requires' are not satisfied with a window listing
the menuentries for the symbol that the user needs to
enable to satisfy what the original symbol requires.
This is the only way to do this in a way so the
user is actually aware that enabling a webcam also enables USB.
Or at least this is my best suggestion.
But sorry - I have not implemented it.
And it is likely more complicated than I foresee.
