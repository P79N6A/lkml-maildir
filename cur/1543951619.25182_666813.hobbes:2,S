It's more reliable than many others, but it's not perfect.
Besides, there are many failure modes beyond the control of the kernel. 
  Hardware errors can lock up the bus and prevent I/O, RAM modules can 
go bad, technicians can yank out cards without waiting for the ready 
light.
For certain classes of devices it's necessary to plan for these sorts of 
things, and a model where the on-disk structures may be inconsistent by 
design is not going to be very attractive.
