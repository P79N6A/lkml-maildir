I think aio could be very useful for databases, but not in this area. I think
it's useful as a more fine-grained tool than sync/fsync. Currently the
database has to fsync a file to commit a transaction, which means flushing
_all_writes to the file even ones from other transactions. If aio inserted
write barriers to the disk controller then it would provide a way to ensure
the current transaction is synced without having to flush all other
transactions writes at the same time.
But I don't see how it's useful for the problem I'm describing.

Indeed we're discussing methods for doing that now. But this seems like a
awkward way to accomplish what the kernel could do very precisely. I don't see
why non-dedicated servers would be make priorities any less useful, in fact I
think that's exactly where they would shine.

User-space has no idea if disk i/o is occurring. The data the transaction
needs could be cached, or it could be on a different disk.
Besides, I think this is far too coarse-grained than what's needed.
Transactions sometimes run for seconds, minutes, or hours,, some of that time
is spent doing disk i/o and some of it doing cpu calculations. It can't stop
and signal another process every time it finishes reading a block and needs to
do a bit of calculation. Then context switch again a millisecond later so it
can read the next block...
And besides, this is would only useful on dedicated servers.
