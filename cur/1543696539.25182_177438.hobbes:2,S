I take it that if the IDE maintainer and you don't use a device it will
not be supported in the future? There's nothing theoretical about ZIP
drives and ATAPI tape drives, you can order them mail order or buy them at
any computer show. And 2.4 ide-scsi seems to support them perfectly, or at
least usefully, which is probably why there haven't been any complaints.
I admit I can't understand why 2.6 supports old NICs and motherboard
chipsets which haven't been made in five years, and then deliberately
desupports devices which did work and which are available at computer
stores and mail order today.
