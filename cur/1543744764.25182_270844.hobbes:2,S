Hrm... Missed that core change, where does it come from ? doesn't quite
go in the direction we have been discussing on linux-pm lately, which
is rather to remove this power_state field entirely since it's mostly
meaningless at this point (or rather, it's semantics are confuse and the
userland interface to it is means pretty much nothing).
While having a power_state field here for internal use of the driver may
be "useful" (avoiding the need for drivers to maintain something
equivalent locally), it's pretty much impossible to have a generic
abstract power_state that has globally defined semantics, at least not
with our current scheme.
