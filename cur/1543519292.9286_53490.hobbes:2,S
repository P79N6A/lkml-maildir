: Ok, here goes the Set2->Set1 (and also AT->XT) table:
: AT XT   AT XT   AT XT   AT XT   AT XT
: 00 ff   20 67   40 6b   60 55   80 ??
: 01 43   21 2e   41 33   61 56   81 ??
: 02 41   22 2d   42 25   62 77   82 ??
: 03 3f   23 20   43 17   63 78   83 41
: 04 3d   24 12   44 18   64 79   84 37
...
Good! However, I find that 84 is translated as 54.
: Also, I've got a book by Gary J Konzak, "PC 8042 Controller",
: ISBN 0-929392-21-3, which is worth reading, and which contains
: the above table.
Thanks - reference added.
