nerver used Fedora before. On my Debian sarge, ifup will call
/etc/network/interfaces,
which looks like follow:
################################
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback
auto eth0
iface eth0 inet static
address 192.168.10.200
netmask 255.255.255.0
broadcast 192.168.10.255
network 192.168.10.0
gateway 192.168.10.1
###############################
with this script,ifup know how to add default gateway to the route
table. Is that your mean ?

If ethX was down, can kernel just drop the packages to ethX ? Is there
anything wrong with kernel to work like this ?
Thanks for your great reply.
