   It might help to understand just what registers do_signal
   needs.  It doesn't need them all, I suspect.
Some of the original register values the process had before
the system call was processed.
I think it's best just to abstract this away properly, as
Linus said to begin with I'd like to note, rather than trying
to come up with a "portable way to call do_signal()".
do_signal is magic and this allows all sorts of great optimizations
and simplifications, please don't add any constraints or complexity
to it.
