IIRC back when the interactivity code was introduces someone raised the 
question about a set of malicious cooperating processes takeing advantage 
of this feature to hog system resources. This seems to match what is 
happening accidently with these pipe processes
at the time an answer was given that satisfied everyone (but I don't 
remember what it was and don't have the time to do the digging for it), I 
seem to remember something about an option to detect the dependancies 
between processes and boost/penalize them as a group in addition to the 
individual bonuses (with this deemed unessasary overhead at the time as 
there were no example cases to show that this was more then a theoretical 
case)
possibly someone with a better memory (or more time to research) can find 
more.

There are two ways of constructing a software design. One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies. And the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies.
