How about giving the command that didn't work, and the error messages it
printed?  I just did a pull using bk://linux.bkbits.net/linux-2.5 and it
succeeded:

Nothing to pull.

There are two different URL syntaxes that start "bk://" and perhaps
you're using the wrong one.  (I got caught by that one a while back.)
And yes, bk:// is preferred over http://, in general.
