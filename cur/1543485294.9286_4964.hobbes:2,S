Hi,
2.2.1 bttv driver fails to detect my tuner type properly. After "insmod
bttv" and "insmod tuner" firing up xawtv generetes lots of noise in my
logs about "tuner type not set".
2.2.1 seems to detect my bttv card as a different type to previous
kernels. Perviously it was detected as "MIRO" and worked. Now, it is
detected as
bttv0: model: BT848(Aimslab-VHX)
"Normal service" is resumed if I force the card type to MIRO with
insmod bttv card=1
Cheers
Chris
