Since it is always the same inode, I would say it is corrupt.  You need to
run e2fsck to fix it.  It looks like it is a single-bit error on the disk.
The rec_len=16404=0x4014.  One (of many possible) valid rec_len would be
0x14=20.  To be valid we need name_len <= rec_len <= block size.
Chances are, when you run e2fsck, it will fix this dirent, but the rest of
the directory entries in that block will be moved to lost+found.
I would suspect a hardware problem, to create a single-bit error (if it
is such).
Cheers, Andreas
