External mouse does not move anymore. External keyboard still works, so that's 
not the solution...
Well, I can do a long-run test with the internal touchpad/keyboard only, to 
see if at least this works now better. "Unfortunately" the problems with 
internal keyboard/touchpad are less frequent and less reproducible.

No, does not help. :-(

Well, IMPS seems to be completely incompatible to normal PS/2, so as expected 
things get worse, means now the internal mouse jumps around like crazy.
Please note, that one of the external mice, the one I am actually testing, is 
not a scroll mouse, but a normal PS/2 mouse.
