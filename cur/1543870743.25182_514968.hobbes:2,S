We (the -stable team) are announcing the release of the 2.6.19.6 kernel.
It contains a number of bugfixes, and all 2.6.19 users are recommended
to upgrade.
Barring anything major, there will not be any more 2.6.19 releases.  If
you disagree with this, please let the stable team know about the
patches that you feel must be in a new release.  We need to move on to
flushing out the very large backlog of 2.6.20-stable patches.
The diffstat and short summary of the fixes are below.
I'll also be replying to this message with a copy of the patch between
2.6.19.5 and 2.6.19.6, as it is small enough to do so.
The updated 2.6.19.y git tree can be found at:
        git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-2.6.19.y.git
and can be browsed at the normal kernel.org git web browser:
        www.kernel.org/git/
thanks,
greg k-h
