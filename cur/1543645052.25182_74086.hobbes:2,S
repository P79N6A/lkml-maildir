Hear, hear. And given that the os io scheduler (I prefer to call it
that, elevator is pretty far from the truth :-) gets so close to drives
optimal performance in most cases, a small tag depth makes sense and
protects us from the latency concerns.

Depends on how often you issue these ordered tags, but yes I hope so
too.
