I was told in absolute terms that any use of &&label other than to pass 
it to goto was not supported, and would not be supported.

Seems that passing to an asm() falls into the same class of problem I 
had.  I think the underlying problem is that if the code containing the 
label is in an inlined function or unrolled loop, the reference can't be 
resolved properly anyway.
