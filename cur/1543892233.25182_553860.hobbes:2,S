When you send in the patch to add that final version, please also
remember to add an entry to Documentation/00-INDEX

Perhaps start out here by telling people what ACPI is. Something like this:
ACPI stands for Advanced Configuration and Power Interface.

The word "provided" seems superfluous here.

I would replace "In history people used to ..." with "Historically
people used to ...".

I would rewrite that bit as :
If you suspect the bug to be in a module in drivers/acpi/*.c code, you
may be able to find or narrow down the culprit simply by adding
printk()'s.

Maybe just me, but I would say "For" here instead of "On".

"... to write away syslog messages over network ..." sounds a little
clumsy to me. Why not simply write "... to send syslog messages over
network ..." ?

"without a serial console" ???

Seems like some bits are missing here ^^^
