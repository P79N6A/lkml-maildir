Agreed.  At best all this does is moving the policy on how to save the kernel
image from the kernel itself out to user space, and it not a cure all.

Also such things as calling BIOS services or EFI services on x86_64.  Where
vm86 is not useful.
So in principle I think a kexec with return is a logical extension to
the current kexec functionality.  
That said it looks like next month before I will have time to do a reasonable
job of reviewing the current patches.
