secure_tcp_syn_cookie() is called from software interrupt
context, therefore it may not sleep.
So you cannot call crypto_alloc_tfm() here, which can sleep.
Not to mention that calling crypto_alloc_tfm() for every TCP
connection creation is absurdly expensive.
Same thing in check_tcp_syn_cookie().
Also, same problem exists with extract_entropy() which also must be
callable from software interrupt context, and thus the
crypto_alloc_tfm() alloc calls you added there are illegal too.
This patch needs tons of work.
