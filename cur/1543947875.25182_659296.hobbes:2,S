Fine with me either way.

I prefer to separate the registers from the bitfields and the other
stuff. That way, no indentation is necessary.

If you want to go down that path, surely reserving the iomem resource
is fine too? Why don't we just kill the whole tclib layer, the driver
can certainly do everything itself?
Of course the driver should be responsible for calling clk_enable() and
clk_disable(). Otherwise, power management will be tricky. And since
the driver may need to make a decision about which interrupts to
request, it might as well call platform_get_irq() directly.
On the other hand, the driver will _always_ need a reference to each
clock, and it will always need a pointer through which to access the
registers, so the mid-layer might as well do those things.
