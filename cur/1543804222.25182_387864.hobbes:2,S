Wow.  OK, that is not immediately obvious from reading the code.  The
only modules in drivers/ that seem to use netlink are iscsi, connector,
and w1.  It's more extensive in net/, I see.

It's not obvious what chunk of the the tree is a good example to follow.
Just look what happened when I suggested to Greg that I use the Dell
firmware loader as an example :-)
The closest approximation I can find to documentation is something Neil
Horman wrote over a year ago:
http://people.redhat.com/nhorman/papers/netlink.pdf
And a "this module does a particularly natty job that all coders would
do well to emulate" pointer would be most welcome.
I notice that libnetlink appears to have disappeared without a trace,
along with Alexey.
