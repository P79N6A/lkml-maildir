Heres my experience with the ESS 1888. I have a Compaq Presario 3060. I can
set up the BIOS to use IRQ 7 for the printer and IRQ 5 for the ESS. If I boot
Windows 98, it runs just fine, and Windows 98 tells me thats where it is - on
IRQ 5.
Now if I try and configure ESS 1888 as a SB under Linux 2.0.36 or 2.2.3 if I
tell it to use IRQ 5, the driver gives an error immediately and says the IRQ
test failed. Now if I for example give IRQ 7, it loads fine, and works for a
while and then dies, with a DMA timout message. I have played with this for a
while - I have noticed that I can tell the sb driver to load using a number of
different interrupts and it works in the way you describe. But it never works
if I give it the interrupt it really is.
Best Regards,
Nick
