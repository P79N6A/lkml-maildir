Hi all,
here comes the second hotfix for 2.4.30, which addresses the vulnerability
reported in CAN-2005-1263 by Paul Starzetz from ISEC :
   
http://linux.exosec.net/kernel/2.4-hf/
The fix was backported and tested by Chris Wright from Greg's 2.6 patch.
Every 2.4.30[-hf1] user should apply the fix. 2.4.29 users can download
the 2.4.29-hf9 release from the same site.
Changelog From 2.4.30-hf1 to 2.4.30-hf2 (semi-automated)
---------------------------------------
'+' = added ; '-' = removed
+ 2.4.30-vuln-CAN-2005-1263-1                           (Greg KH, Chris Wright)
  From Paul Starzetz: A locally exploitable flaw has been found in the Linux
  ELF binary format loader's core dump function that allows local users to
  gain root privileges and also execute arbitrary code at kernel privilege
  level.
Regards,
Willy
