This has nothing to do with unionfs. This is about doing a VFS based
approach to union mounts. Unification is a name-based construct so it
belongs into VFS and not into a separate file system.

Mounting a file system twice is bad in the first place. This should be
done by using bind mounts and bind a mounted file system into a union.
After that the normal locking rules apply (and hopefully work ;).
