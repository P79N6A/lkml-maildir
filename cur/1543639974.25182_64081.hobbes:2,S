I agree, patch 1/38 should be renumbered to 38/38, and everything else
shifted back by one.  If I have to repost the patchset (e.g. after rediff
to 2.5.32), I'll be sure to do this.
In the meantime, patch 1/38 does not conflict with any of the others;
the patches can be applied cleanly in the order
  2,3,4,....,38, 1
Maybe we can just consider this to be the patch ordering for purposes of
deciding which to apply to the 2.5.31 tree?  This way I won't have to
repost 200K of patches before 2.5.32 comes out...
Thanks,
 Kendrick
