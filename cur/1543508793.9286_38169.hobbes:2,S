Hello,
when I upgraded my servers from 2.0.36 to 2.0.38 I noticed that I get alot
of network problems with the vortex drivers.
All of a sudden alot of errors in received packages occured and when I
pinged the machines within the local network I got lots of package losses
(sometimes even 50%!).
I downgraded to 2.0.36 again and everything is fine again.
If you need any further information about my configuration or hardware
revision just send me an email. :-)
Harry
