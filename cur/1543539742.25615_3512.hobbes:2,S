This information is available. You can download IDE specs from net
and (binary DOS) programs dealing with disks are available from
manufacturers sites. Are those programs compliant with the specs
or not?

I'm not sure if it's the case. There is no statement in OEM warranty
about any commands not listed in IDE specs. Such statement would make
using manufacturers tools (and probably other specialized tools)
impossible if you want the warranty.
That might vary between vendors of course.
We don't yet know if corrupted drive firmware can be fixed without
removing the HDD from the system, given the firmware file and required
utility/information is available.

I don't know it they can or not, but even Andrea confirms the driver
is compliant to the standard - as unlisted (extended) commands are.
