Or a combination of the two - for example a raid card that drives its own
NCR chips and any others it finds on the mainboard

Correct.

It uses motherboard resources. You can also reconfigure those motherboard
resources, but you have to beat the I2O controller around the head to do it.
I2O 2.0 is supposed to clean that up and handle I2O management of hot plug
PCI devices

I was anticipating that you would need to have an "owner" for each device,
and that owner which now happens to always been the CPU might change. Then you'd
call the owners methods for reassignment notification.
