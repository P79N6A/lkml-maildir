it all started when i was testing some code for copy data to a frame buffer for
speed
i was using a 32 bit int ( clock_t = clock() ; ) which is clocked at 1 Mhz
the problem is that the register will rollover in ( 2^32 / 1 * 10^6 = 71.58
minutes )
and my tests may last longer than 71.58 minutes also the resolution is only 1 us
i was wrong about the internel cpu counter it is 64 bit not 32 bit ( good this
will solve the problem)
i can use the rdtsc instruction but the code will only work on intel cpu's so it
would be good if there was a sandard way of accessing high resolution counters on
any linux platform
floats will only loose LSB resolution if you overload the significand part of the
fpu register
to stop this when the significand part is at is max +1 reset it to 0
