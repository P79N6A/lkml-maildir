Thanks for being triply impolite! You score: anonymous, top-posting and
dropping CC-lists.
The code in these files, as in most other files in the Linux kernel, is
copyrighted. The code is Licensed under GPLv2, but copyright belongs to
Red Hat and it's authors are Ingo and myself.
That is, say you want to use this code in a non GPLv2 project (say this
GPLv3 thing) then you would need to contact the copyright owner of this
code.
