This is also where I (as a libhugetlbfs maintainer/developer) see
these patches being very helpful (for example, see Adam Litke's recent
posting on resizing the hugepage pool dynamically). Making hugepages
"easier" to use -- and in this case that means more likely to
successfully resize the hugepage pool at run-time -- is a good thing.

Ack.
