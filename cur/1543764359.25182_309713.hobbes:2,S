The i486 book says that if the next instruction lets the IF
flag remain enabled, then any interrupts pending occur after
the next instruction. If the next instruction is CLI, no
interrupts will occur. There is a note:
"In case of an NM1, trap, or fault following ST1, the interrupt
will be taken before executing the next sequential instruction
in the code." The use of "NM1" and "ST1" is (sic). I don't
know what NM1 is, it can't be NMI because, by definition NMI
is not maskable so CLI and STI could not affect this pin.
