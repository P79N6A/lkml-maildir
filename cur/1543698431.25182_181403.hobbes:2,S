"T" isn't "traced", it's "sTopped" ("S" was already taken by "Sleeping").
And yes, terminating strace unexpectedly sometimes seems to leave the
tracee stopped. I _think_ the bug might be the kernel (reparent_thread()
should probably do all the same things that "ptrace_detach()" does, namely
wake the thread up), but it has never bothered me enough for me to care
deeply enough to check.
You can wake up the tracee by hand with a "kill -CONT pid".
If you dig into this and decide to fix the kernel, holler.
