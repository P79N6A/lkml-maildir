becouse the SELinux people don't want to have this in their code for one 
thing.
you seem to be ignoring the SELinux people who say that pathnames are 
fundamentally different from labels, labels stay with the data if the file 
is renamed, path names do not. multiple hard-links to the same file will 
always have the same label for SELinux, but could have very different 
permissions with AA
labels are part of policy, policy is not supposed to be decided by the 
kernel.
SELinux treats all files with the same label the same. to have the same 
ability to treat every file differntly that AA has SELinux would have to 
give every file a different label.

how will you know how many labels you need to put into your policy that 
you load into the kernel?
how will the kernel figure out what label to use for a file
and the userspace code that converts the policy needs to know the names 
when it feeds the policy into the kernel.
and you still need to implement the new LSM hooks that AA is asking for to 
figure out what the path to a file is.

the policy mechanism is supposed to be the LSM hooks, and AA is trying to 
re-use them.

after you change SELinux to be able to do everything that AA does then you 
can tell SELinux to act like AA, true but irrelavent.

first off, and for the record, it's not _my_ implementation. I have 
nothing to do with writing AA.
I am just someone who manages hundreds of servers for which AA would be a 
good fit. In the past I've gone to a lot of effort to get less security 
then AA would provide to implement seperate services in seperate chroot 
sandboxes. I'm looking for easier and better options, I've looked at 
SELinux and don't believe that I can produce a reasonable policy in a 
reasonable amount of time (and I don't trust distro vendors to do it for 
me, they have to allow a lot of things that don't make sense on my 
systems, and I occasionally need to allow something that wouldn't make 
sense in the general case, let alone all the software I run that the disto 
doesn't know anything about)
chroot sandboxes, virtual machines, containers all have the problem that 
when you need to have more then one application interacting they need to 
be put togeather and the basic mechanism doesn't provide you any security 
against each other.
SELinux is aiming for 'perfect' security, I'll readily admit that, just 
like I'll admit that AA is only aiming for 'good enough' security, but 
that 'good enough' security would help me and I don't see any way to get 
to SELinux's 'perfect' security.
I also don't care about the details of how it gets implemented, but when 
the AA people have a working implementation, and the SELinux people are 
strongly opposed to the concept, I don't see any advantage in trying to 
get the AA people to throw away a lot of their working code to try and get 
people (many of who have be very insulting frankly) to accept such 
fandamental changes.
if the SELinux people had responded to the announcement of AA with "that's 
a nice idea, if we add these snippits from your code to SELinux then we 
can do the same thing" it would be a very different story.
but as always patches talk louder then anything else, if you believe that 
the efforts should be combined so strongly why don't you start submitting 
the appropriate patches to SELinux to make it able to do what AA does?
