Uhm, my tests have shown it to be very fast and efficient. But I didn't
look to see if all packets got through to the logfile. But getting it to
write logs at ~35MB/s wasn't a problem.
Did you specify --ulog-qthreshold 50 ?
and did you specify --ulog-cprange at all? if you don't it will copy the
entire packet to userspace. I copy 64 bytes to userspace and that's more
than enough to log everything needed.

Ok, we are working on memory-usage and scalability stuff.

It should cost a little bit more but not very much.
