On my IBM Thinkpad 390E my PCMCIA works fine with 2.4.5, on very rare 
occasions
the mouse will drift diagonaly to the lower right corner. I read in the kernel
sources that this happens normaly due to probing of the PCMCIA which screws up
the mouse device. It happens so rarely I have not yet taken the time to try to
debug it.
