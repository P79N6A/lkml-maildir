We (Sun, AMD, Nvidia and Red Hat) have been testing a patch that seems
to solve the problem.  AMD and Nvidia analyzed an HDT trace that
seemed to indicate that CPU updates of the GATT were still in cache
when a subsequent table walk caused by a device load used a stale GATT
PTE.  That analysis inspired this patch, submitted to this list as an
RFC.  It is not obvious (to me, at least) why this problem has only
shown up on Nvidia SATA controllers.
We are continuing to investigate.
