  Exactly... We have to have submitted buffers on some list.

  I see. Well, I could do the following minimal changes if it'd make you more
comfortable about it):
  1) Don't clear b_assoc_map in fsync_buffers_list() (that would get rid of
race with drop_buffers())
  2) Change fsync_buffers_list() to readd buffer into private_list when it
is dirty after we've waited on it. That should get rid of the second
race.
  But I still think that unnecessary temporary list is worth a cleanup ;).

  Well, I've added that WARN_ON() which warned us about the problem about
14 month ago so it was not that bad. But I agree that bugs are hard to
detect here as they result either in lost IO error or in not writing all
buffers on fsync both of which go mostly unnoticed.
