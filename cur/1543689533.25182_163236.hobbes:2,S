It already can, the install tool just happens to involve invoking gcc
and wrapping it nicely. People have already solved that. I'm actually
less worried in some ways about the binary only module wrapper question
because source wrappers around a binary module to handle glueing them
together puts the shipper in conflict with a patent filing owned by a
very large hardware company as well as in GPL questionmarks..
