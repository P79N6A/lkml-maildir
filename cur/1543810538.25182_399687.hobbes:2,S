You didn't say what kernel version you're concerned with.  There have
definitely been fixes in this area in the last year.  If you're using a
current kernel and PTRACE_DETACH can't leave the thread stopped, please
let us know.  I'd have expected the CLONE_STOPPED approach to work too.
However, I also recall some trouble with having one thread running
ptraced while another thread is not ptraced, where SIGTRAP would be
delivered to the wrong thread.  So there may still be trouble.
