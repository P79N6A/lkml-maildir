Hmmm, one way around this is to have the packet queue store things in
in a linear array of pointers to data areas, then process things in
bursts, ie:
	- find packet data areas for queued packets
	- walk list doing prefetches of ip header and options
	- then actually do the packet processing (save output for later)
That will require a number of new hooks for pipelining operations, though.
Just a thought.
