/me was once wondering as well why kgdb installs a seconds way of
handling (its own) faults. Jason explained to me that this approach is
more robust against corruption along the normal fix-up path. Maybe he
can elaborate better than I why this is useful (or what real-life bug
once encouraged the current design).

If you recall the issues (and they are still present), it would be nice
to have them listed. kgdb suffered a lot from historic cruft, but we
already remove at least some of it over the last patching rounds.
Whatever remains should be addressed ASAP.
