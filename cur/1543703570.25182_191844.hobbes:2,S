Virtually all sleep_on / interruptible_sleep_on users are racy. Actually
there is only one safe case: if both wakeup and sleep happen under
lock_kernel.
Any objections against killing it entirely? Or what about marking it as
deprecated, as the first step towards killing it?
I'll follow with two patches that remove it from shaper and sunrpc/sched
- shaper is racy, rpciod_down is only safe if called with lock_kernel.
