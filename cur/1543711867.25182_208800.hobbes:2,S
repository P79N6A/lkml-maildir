I'm continuing the work on this system; Dan or I will try to get a serial
console hooked up soon (I'm working on system mostly remotely,
unfortunately).
What I've found so far:
it doesn't appear to be so much a problem with the megaraid driver
specifically; appears to be related more to the x86_64 code.  I've found
that kernel 2.4.25 from kernel.org works fine *if* mem=8128 is passed;
which would appear to me to be an issue with pci memory allocation. 
However RHEL3's 2.4.21-4ELsmp and 2.4.21-9.0.1ELsmp kernels do not work. 
I've also applied MTRR patches and some minor other fixups to no avail so
far.  I have not tried to apply ACPI/APIC patches yet to the RHEL kernels.
The driver stops after sending the first enquiry command to the card;
waits in a tight while loop polling for a response from the card with
interrupts disabled.
