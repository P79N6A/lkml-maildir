If that's a separate transaction, then yes, I believe it would not be
convered under the terms of GPLv3, but IANAL.  There might be some
catch about intent, and also about contractual obligations in the
hardware sale to provide the software (coupons anyone? :-) or some
such.
But then, that you sell specialized devices with say only MIT-licensed
software shouldn't stop you from selling CD-ROMs with GPLed software,
even if those CD-ROMs could possibly run on that device.
The GPLv3 won't remove every way in which people who want/need to stop
the user from making changes to the software could accomplishing this
(ROM).  It will just make this a bit more inconvenient, such that
vendors that have the option respect users' freedoms, and those that
find it too inconvenient respect the wishes of users who don't want
their software turned non-free.
