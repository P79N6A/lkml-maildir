If the ISA bus is below 8 MHz, we might need a longer delay. If we default
to the longer delay, the delay will be too long for more than 99,99 % of 
all systems, not counting i586+. Especially if the driver is fine-tuned to 
give maximum throughput, this may be bad.
OTOH, the DOS drivers I heared about use delays and would break on 
underclocked ISA busses if the n * ISA_HZ delay was needed. Maybe
somebody having a configurable ISA bus speed and some problematic
chips can test it ...
