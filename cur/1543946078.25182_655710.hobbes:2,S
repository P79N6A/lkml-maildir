Depends on how much is the device broken or what it can do.
IIRC you'll always get memory from DMA-zone for < ~0U dma_masks on kernels older 
than 2.6.(around 10). If you set dma_masks to < ~0U, you will probably (in the 
meaning, kernel will try to allocate from higher space and fall back to the 
dma-zone) get higher pages nowadays. However I don't know how far this applies 
also to systems with iommu in retrospective.
