Could be the case. This morning I've turned off PREEMPT support in
linux 2.6.9-rc2 kernel, booted just fine, ran apt-get update ... it
seemed everything is ok. 
Then setup IPsec policies, ping remote end, racoon has tried to negotiate 
with a remote end and ... laptop freezes again (this time without
PREEMPT).
At a time I was in X, couldn't capture the OOPS, after reboot
/var/log/kern.log is empty ... :(
Doesn't seem it is PREEMPT related I think now.
