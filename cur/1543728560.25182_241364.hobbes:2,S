BTW: FreeBSD5 supports the fsck of a unclean filesystem in the background.
(Actually it supports to mount unclean filesystems because they are "always"
consistent and do reclaiming of unreferenced objects in a fsck in background
based on a snapshot)
I am not sure why the softupdates are so reliable, that no fsck is needed,
but I know it is pretty cool to do it in background only, especially for
notebooks. And I agree that background checks of long running systems may
catch problems - however I am not sure how a consitent FS view is best
created for that.
