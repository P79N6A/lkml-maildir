Supposing one maintained upper and lower bounds on reserved space the
best it appears to be able to do is a check on the lower bound and
opportunistically add to the upper bound, as it's nonblocking. If the
callers could be given hints to back out of their locks and retry
reservations while blocking, that may do. filemap_fdatawait() can, but
there are a lot of bizarre callers, e.g. fs/hfsplus/bnode.c, and no one
maintains that kind of information.

It seems more like a property of the sb, so referring things to ->i_sb
and flagging the condition in there may make some sense. But a worse
problem with all this is that the wrong one may catch the error. e.g.
one process doing mmap() IO writes to a hole on a full fs, one process
doing mmap() IO writes to already-allocated blocks, both block,
AS_ENOSPC is set on behalf of the writer to the hole, and the writer to
the already-allocated blocks reaps it. The only IO codepath that runs out
of context from the submitting processes without alternative methods of
returning the error is vmscan.c, so in principle returning errors to
callers should work. But converting fs drivers to doing something for
set_page_dirty() et al to report or even propagating -ENOSPC back from
all of the ->writepage() and ->writepages() callsites looks painful. And
supposing one moved the ENOSPC flag to the sb the events that would
clear it aren't now trapped by anything.
Hmm. More questions than answers, again. Let me know if there are any
fs/ or mm/ sweeps you want done for ENOSPC-relevant things (not
necessarily any of the above).
