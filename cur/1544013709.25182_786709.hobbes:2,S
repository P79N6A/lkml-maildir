Any of the flash filesystems should handle that.  The main problem with jffs2 
is it doesn't scale well to large device sizes.  UBIFS is supposed to scale 
much better, but I haven't played with it yet.
And the thing about USB thumb drives is they present as a normal block device, 
_not_ as flash, so you can't _query_ their erase granularity.  (It's like 
those hardware raid cards that wouldn't tell you they were striping and such 
so you had to figure out a well-performing layout all by yourself.)   They do 
it magically behind the scenes, and if the power goes out (or you yank the 
device out unexpectedly) if they haven't got a built-in capacitor or battery 
to have enough power to complete their pending transaction, you're screwed.
Plus they do horrible wear levelling, the lot of 'em.  Read Val Henson's 
livejournal entry about it: 
http://valhenson.livejournal.com/25228.html
There was also a marvelous thread Linus participated in on some hardware 
industry web message board, but I have no idea where it's gone...

See Ted's comment.  The summary's fine, the question is where to put this sort 
of thing...

Well, the journal won't notice.  An e2fsck will notice huge swaths of missing 
metadata, but won't be able to do anything about it.  (And if what got zapped 
was file _contents_ rather than metadata, you're on your own finding it.  Fun, 
isn't it?)
