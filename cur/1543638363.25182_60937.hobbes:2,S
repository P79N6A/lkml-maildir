   What about applications that want fine-grained page aging? 4MB is a
   tad on the course side for most desktop applications.
Once vmscan sees the page and tries to liberate it, then it
will be unlarge'd and thus you'll get fine-grained page aging.
That's the beauty of my implementation suggestion.
