Is this machine's time is synchronized with some server using ntp. I
had seen some very similar issue when the clock deviation was more
than a second .If clock is adjusted and time difference becomes more
than 2 sec the diffence becomes negative because timeval has its
members as signed int.It think that issue might be playing a role
here.
