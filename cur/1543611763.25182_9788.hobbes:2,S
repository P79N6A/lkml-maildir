I planned to do something like this for the kernel-janitor project.
The janitor todo-list is aparently too terse for some people, and
having a perl script to point out problems wasn't enough. Maybe having the
script point to a webpage explaining /why/ xxxx needs changing would be
more useful.
The current TODO list there goes halfway toward this, but needs
expanding, more explanations etc.. Any contributions more than
welcomed.
regards,
Dave.
