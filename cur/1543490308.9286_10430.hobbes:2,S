just booted kernel 2.2.3 SMP. run "free" and I get this:
[root@cygnus admin]# free 
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:        257940     254908       3032     460008     108192      23952
-/+ buffers/cache:     122764     135176
Swap:        40156          0      40156
the "shared" column being what's wrong with this picture.
top reports the same thing.
happens in 2.2.2 and 2.2.1 also.
running procinfo 16, procps v1.2.9 (even though ps --version says 1.2.7)
gcc 2.7.2.1, libc 5.4.38
Any help is appreciated.
