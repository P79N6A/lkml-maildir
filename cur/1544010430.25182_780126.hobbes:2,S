Actually I think it matters, that's why a 'tag' differs to a 'tag
object'. Also, a tag can point to any other object, not just to a
commit. (Though usually it does.)

Won't it be confusing that a symlink can be stored as a blob, tags are
refs, but refs are not blobs?

Agreed, the object database is not interesting for a beginner.
