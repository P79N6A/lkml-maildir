Not feasible.  The linker is (I believe) free to place them anywhere it
likes unless we go and aggregate them in a struct.
Take (just for one example) inode_lock.  How do we prevent that from
sharing a cacheline with (to pick another example) rtnl_mutex?
The insidious thing about this is that is is highly dependent upon
compiler/linker version and upon kernel config.  So performance differences
will appears and disappear with us having very little understanding why.
I guess we could hunt down the write-very-often variables and put them in
private cachelines.  But there will be a *lot* of them when one considers
all possible workloads and all possible drivers.
Now, if we had named it __read_often rather than __read_mostly then we might
end up with a better result: all those read-mostly, read-rarely variables (and
there are a lot of those) could be very usefully deployed by packing them
in between the write-often variables.
It's crying out for a performance-guided solution.
