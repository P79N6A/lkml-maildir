Subject: Unable to compile cvs kernel on Sparc

Hi
I have a SparcStation 10 with dual SuperSparc processors (_not_
sparc64), and I am unable to compile the latest kernel from
vger.samba.org CVS.  Standard Linus kernels neither work, but I figure
they aren't supposed to...
The reason seems to be that the functions pmd_alloc_one_fast,
pmd_alloc_one, and pgd_populate needed for memory.c are not declared in
include/asm-sparc/
System information:
Distribution:   Debian testing/woody
GCC:            2.95.4 (standard debian package)
Running kernel: 2.2.19
Trying to compile: 2.4.5-pre1 from cvs
I would be most happy to provide other specific info on request.
Oystein
