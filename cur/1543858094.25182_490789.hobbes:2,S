A while back my distro moved to libata for sata_via.  I was since
confused; my disk seemed a lot slower, and it looked like DMA was off.
I'm not sure how SATA works; is it even possible to enable/disable
32-bit IO and DMA?  Or are those just on?
sata_via               11524  4
libata                112660  3 ata_generic,pata_via,sata_via
~$ sudo hdparm -d1 -c1 -u1 /dev/sda
/dev/sda:
 setting 32-bit IO_support flag to 1
 HDIO_SET_32BIT failed: Invalid argument
 setting unmaskirq to 1 (on)
 HDIO_SET_UNMASKINTR failed: Inappropriate ioctl for device
 setting using_dma to 1 (on)
 HDIO_SET_DMA failed: Inappropriate ioctl for device
 IO_support   =  0 (default 16-bit)
I no longer have two kernels to test through; I can't tell if the speed
is back or not.  Nothing in dmesg tells me if SATA is using DMA or
32-bit IO support though, so I don't know... lack of knowledge over here
is killing me for troubleshooting this on my own.
