Correct. You can make segments with different attributes, like
you can make the stack non-executable, etc. However, the base
addresses need to be the same so that DS:[0], ES:[0], and SS:[0]
all point to the same memory location or else the offsets computed
by the 'C' compiler won't work.
You can force an assembler to calculate different offsets. For instance,
you could have the base of DS be one page lower (0x1000) than SS.
Then you could make the assembler calculate, based upon that
difference, (in Intel, TASM, MASM, the ASSUME statement). But
with most 'C' compilers, you are stuck with what you have.

If you wanted to write everything in assembly (shudder), in
principle, you could set up a stack segment that pointed
to entirely different RAM (real RAM) than the data segment.
However, it would mean that you need to rewrite everything
that copies data to/from local data (the stack), etc. Without
that memcpy(), etc., wouldn't work. In fact, the Intel built-in
macros like movsb, movsw, movsl, etc., assume DS:ESI, ES:EDI, for
index (pointer) registers. Note also that there are two seldom-
used segment registers, FS and GS.
