Hi Steven,
I've been using cifs in 2.5.61 instead of smbfs (it has problems with
slab debugging) for 4.5 days now and I just noticed a bad thing.
I was looking at /proc/slabinfo and this jumped out at me:
size-64           1843081 1847421     72 .....
that's a _lot_ of allocations.
I tried to figure out what was leaking and every time I listed a
directory mounted from a samba server it increased. A simple ls -R was
scary to see.
Then I unmounted all my cifs filesystems (two) and removed the cifs
module and got this:
kmem_cache_destroy: Can't free all objects e8eefd00
cifs_destroy_request_cache: error not all structures were freed
Is this a known problem?

Never argue with an idiot. They drag you down to their level, then beat you with experience.
