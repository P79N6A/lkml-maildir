Yes, that's why this is only done in the last two patches. The rest are
completely independent and don't interfere with the API (well, ok,
FIX_SIZE() needs to be dropped in fs/relayfs if it's fetching it from the
header, but that's it).

I'm not advocating its removal, I'm more interested in using it from
sysfs and debugfs where it makes more sense. Splitting up CONFIG_RELAY
and CONFIG_RELAYFS_FS will allow for both, and it'll also be possible to
migrate the existing CONFIG_RELAYFS_FS code to use CONFIG_RELAY without
breaking the userspace APIs if we want to get rid of the duplication. The
only issue will be wrapping up the default callbacks, but that's a
trivial ifdef.
