On another box which has 4 times more RAM or a bit more than twice total
memory, it had twice as high vm.min_free_kbytes
on another node with even more RAM it is 13821..
hm - so what is the algorithm which sets it? percent of available RAM?
For now I am adjusting it on that server to be twice from default.
Thanks everyone for your help
