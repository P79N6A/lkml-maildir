loff_t is a 64 bit long. We could put shift behind offset_mask.

Right. I had an earlier implementation that just used an order field. See 
V2 of this patchset. That did a lot of shifting instead of lookups.

No. u8 would be sufficient. If you can stuff in other stuff in between 
then I can switch it.

It simplifies the generated asm code significantly.

Not yet. I'd be glad if you could come up with a patch that converts it.
