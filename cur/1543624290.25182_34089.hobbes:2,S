I was referring to having a userspace conduit for submitting requests, a 
la the taskfile ioctl now.

I like this solution, it was the one I was thinking of :)
The entire userspace raw cmd ioctl should be a separate module for 
precisely the issues you outlined.  If they choose, people can compile 
that module into the static kernel image, including filter.  Or they can 
use the module without the filter.  Or they can not use the module at 
all.  Etc.
I do understand the problems stemming from the inflexibility of the 
filter that's being discussed, but I disagree that it's a fundamental 
flaw.  It's an option that some people -shouldn't- choose, for various 
reasons.  But that's an issue for documentation and system integrators.
