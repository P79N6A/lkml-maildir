Subject: early PCI detection?

There is a known incompatibility between AMD 76x northbridges and
VIA southbridges which makes IO-APIC mode unreliable.
(See AMD's errata sheets for details.)
The question is: can the Linux kernel run PCI detection before
IO-APIC initialisation, so as to prevent IO-APIC mode on mainboards
using this configuration?
Alternatively we could list known problem boards in the DMI blacklist
table, but this is clearly an inferior solution.
