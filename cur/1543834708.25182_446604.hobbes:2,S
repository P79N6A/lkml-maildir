That's why I'm suggesting adding a cheap, possibly low-res, gettimeofday 
virtual system call in case there is no way for the kernel to provide 
userspace with a cheap full-resolution gettimeofday.  Obviously, if a 
high-quality gettimeofday is available, then they can be linked together 
by the kernel.
