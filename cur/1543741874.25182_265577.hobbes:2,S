updating to an even more recent (read: updated now) does not help and the
problem is really triggered when loading snd_ens1371. well, the only
"problem" is the oops and i have no sound :-(
just strange that nobody else cries out loud. or am i just lacking enough
information? ok, this is debian/unstable (i386), gcc3.4.2, libc2.3.2, pls
tell me if you need more information.
thank you,
Christian.
