With "no_subtree_check" the server will not attempt to verify that a
given filehandle points to a file that is beneath an exported directory;
thus an attacker can guess filehandles of files not beneath any exported
directory and use those guessed filehandles to acces files you didn't
mean to export.
Even with "no_subtree_check", the server can still recognize which
filesystem a filehandle belongs to; so you're only in trouble if you
have files you don't want exported on the same partition as files you do
want exported.
See "man exports" for more.
