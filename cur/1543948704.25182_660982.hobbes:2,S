Okay -- removed.
But it is an ugly inconsistency.  On the one hand, a child process
cannot add the duplicate file descriptor to the epoll set.  (In every
other case that I can think of , descriptors duplicated by fork have
similar semantics to descriptors duplicated by dup() and friends.)  On
the other hand, the very fact that the child has a duplicate of the
descriptor means that even if the parent closes its descriptor, then
epoll_wait() in the parent will continue to receive notifications for
that descriptor because of the duplicated descriptor in the child.
The choice of [file *, fd] as the key for epoll sets really does seem
unfortunate.  Keying on [pid, fd] would have given saner semantics, it
seems to me.  Obviously it can't be changed now though.
Cheers,
Michael
