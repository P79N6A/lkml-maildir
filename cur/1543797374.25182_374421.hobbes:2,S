This is an incorrect usage of is_hugepage_only_range().  Although it
will get the right answer by accident here, that function should
*only* be used for testing whether a range is suitable for normal
pages, never for determining if hugepages are actually in use here.
You have the VMA here, so test its flag instead here.
