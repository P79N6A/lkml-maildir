Possibly, but it could then conflict with something else. Anytime we
add/change some global symbol, we would have to scan entire kernel
for conflicts (authors of (yet) off-tree things would hate us).
I don't think it's practical, especially with, IMHO, no real gain.

You're welcome. I'd be more happy if I could say I like the idea :-(
