Exactly.
If Linus persists in this diff-tree output format, using two lines for
changed files, then I will have to add the following sed script to my
arsenal:
  sed '/^</ { N; s/\n>/ / }'
It collapses pairs of lines:
<100664 4870bcf91f8666fc788b07578fb7473eda795587 Makefile
>100664 5493a649bb33b9264e8ed26cc1f832989a307d3b Makefile
to the single line:
<100664 4870bcf91f8666fc788b07578fb7473eda795587 Makefile 100664 5493a649bb33b9264e8ed26cc1f832989a307d3b Makefile
However, more people will get bit by this git glitch than know sed.
