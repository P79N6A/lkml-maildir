Hi everyone,
Okay - I just tried 2.3.18ac4 + Jens' patch and things still don't
work.  OTOH, the kernel actually doesn't try as hard to make the SCSI
drive work, so I don't get into a dead loop.  Good job with the SCSI
cleanups, Alan.  
Anyway, I was able to get the system to actually give some verbose error
messages about what's going on under kernel 2.2.13p7.  It does look like
a SCSI problem, and might be a problem with the drive, or how the drive
is handling things.  Could someone with appropriate SCSI clue take a
look at the errors below? It probably is a problem with the hardware,
but I'd like to be able to tell the people at Yamaha that their drive
doesn't properly support X SCSI commands when reading the CD volume,
rather than telling them that it doesn't work with linux.
Thanks very much,
Greg Zornetzer

and so on.
Finally, timeouts started occurring, and the SCSI bus was reset.  That
actually by-passed the problems, so it seems that whatever command is
failing isn't totally necessary to play cd audio, but the SCSI cdrom
driver has issues when it doesn't complete properly.
