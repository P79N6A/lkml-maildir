Subject: Linux 2.3.18ac[1-9] kernels do not boot

Hi,
I am running a stock 2.3.18 kernel, which seems to
work
fine on my machine.
But I tried the ac patched kernels and they fail to
boot on my machine. The problem is that the ac patched
kernels fail to boot on my machine. After typing
"linux" on lilo, the computer says uncompressing
kernel, then booting from kernel, and then just hangs.
No more output, just the two lines. On the other hand,
the stock 2.3.18 kernel seems to work perfectly.
I had the problem with ac7, so I waited for ac8 and
then ac9. All had the same problem. So I tried to find
out when the problem started. I started with ac1, and
didn't have to go far, because the problem started
with
this first ac patch.
I have a AMD K6-III on a MVP VIA-3 MB, and realtek
8029
NIC. My config file is included below. The same config
file works with the stock kernel.
Is anyone experiencing this problem? If not, then
could
anyone tell me how to diagnose the problem? If you
need
more information, let me know.
thanks,
Anant
