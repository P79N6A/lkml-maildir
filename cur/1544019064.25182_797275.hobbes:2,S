And majority of usages is some debugging printk where nobody cares if ->comm
corrupted.
Changelog says is useful for debugging. That's right, tsk->comm is useful
for debugging, not allocating temporary buffer + get_task_comm().
Some ->comm usages are for kernel threads which never change it, for starters.
current->comm is always safe, because, current is not executing prctl(2)! 
I'd say nothing should be done and, heavens forbid, adding this to checkpatch.pl.
