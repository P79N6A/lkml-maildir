Subject: [PATCH] Compress kernel modules on installation.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Hi,
(I've sent this to the linux-kbuild and linux-kernel lists as this
patch modifies the Makefile.modinst file. I also don't subscribe to the 
linux-kbuild and linux-kernel mailing lists so can I have any replies
CC'ed to me please)
This patch allows kernel modules to be compressed when 'make
modules_install' is run after being copied to
the /lib/module/<version>/<...> directory which is useful if you have
module-init-tools installed with --enable-zlib. This patch adds an
option (MODULE_COMPRESS) to the kernel configuration file (specifically
init/Kconfig) so that the kernel modules will compressed if
MODULE_COMPRESS is set.
When MODULE_COMPRESS is set the output of 'make modules_install' will
go as the following:
INSTALL  drivers/fs/xfs/xfs.ko
COMPRESS drivers/fs/xfs/xfs.ko
INSTALL  drivers/fs/fat/fat.ko
COMPRESS drivers/fs/fat/fat.ko
...
I've tested my patch on kernel versions 2.6.24.2, 2.6.24-git12, 2.6.23.14 and
2.6.19 and they compile, install and compress into the respective
module directories without any errors.
I've also tested this with the uvcvideo (linux-uvc) kernel module (from
the SVN branch and with kernel versions 2.6.24.2, 2.6.24-git12, 2.6.23.14 and
2.6.19) as that uses Kbuild properly when installing the module and
after installing the uvcvideo the module is then compressed.
Unfortunately, I couldn't find any other kernel modules which used the
Kbuild system for installing their kernel modules. :(
I've included include/config/auto.conf in Makefile.modinst so that it
can check if MODULE_COMPRESS is set when installing the kernel modules.
Unfortunately when I ran mkinitrd (CentOS version) to create the initrd
image to go with the kernel, I get errors saying that certain kernel
modules don't exist despite the fact they do actually exist. When I
pass --allow-missing to mkinitrd, it seems to go fine but when booting
up with the system with the new initrd image I get error messages
saying that the modules don't exist.
A workaround is to compile the modules, don't have MODULE_COMPRESS set 
in .config, install the modules, run mkinitrd and copy it to /boot, set 
MODULE_COMPRESS in .config and then install the modules again but
compressed.
That's about it really. The only showstopper I feel is mkinitrd not
working properly with the compressed kernel modules.
Thanks,
Steve
