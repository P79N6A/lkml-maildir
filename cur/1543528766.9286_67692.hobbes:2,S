I think the >512 sector request handling should be done with a precise
field in the request that is declared as clobbered (req->sector should
remains read_only, writeable only by the highlevel layer in the common
usage). A new req->driver_sector will be set by the highlevel layer always
correctly (also from end_request) and the lowlevel layer can
advance/overwrite it to do the larger block handling.

NOTE: I wasn't proposing that ;). I was instead proposing to fixup the
end_request semantics so that to get simple drivers fixed automatically
without braindamage ;). Unfortunately it wasn't so trivial as I thought at
first and I didn't gone into that cleanup seriously yet (I timed out while
reading the floppy driver precisely... ;).

A new:
	req->driver_sector
will do the trick.
It will work exactly as req->buffer is _just_ currently working.
As req->buffer it will be clobbered by lowlevel driver across request_fn
and end_request and get set correctly by the highlevel layer before
calling request_fn and after each end_request.
Or another option is to left req->sector to the lowlevel layer and add a
new req->rq_sector or whatever else name for the highlevel accounting.
Drivers like loop and nbd won't need dirty hacks then (as they just don't
need dirty hacks for advancing req->buffer before calling end_request even
if req->buffer is advanced exactly like req->sector by hd.c).
