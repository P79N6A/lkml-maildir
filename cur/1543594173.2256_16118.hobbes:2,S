Hi,
My machine has an
- Intel D440LX motherboard (440LX chipset, onboard
  Adaptec AIC7880U SCSI, onboard EEPRO-100 NIC, onboard Cirrus VGA),
- 2 Pentium-II, 266 MHz CPUs
- second EEPRO-100 NIC
- SCSI HD and CDROM
Using the 2.4.2-smp kernel from RedHat 7.1 gives spontaneous reboots,
the 2.4.5 kernel too, when configured for SMP.
No crash dump available - applying the lkcd patch didn't help either.
The machine runs stable with a uni-processor kernel (2.4.2), though.
Does anyone have any idea what's going wrong here?
Reactions please also cc: to my email address.
Greetings,
Daniel Tuijnman
