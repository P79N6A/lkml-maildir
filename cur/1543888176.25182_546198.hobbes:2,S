And those original "errors"? Did not those modifications cause this in turn?
/dev/hda3 has been mounted 38 times without being checked, check forced
HTREE directory inode 1163319 has an invalid root node.
HTREE INDEX CLEARED
Entry '..' in .../??? (5570587) has deleted/unused inode 5570561. 
CLEARED.
/dev/hda3: Entry '..' in .../??? (5570620) has deleted/unused inode 
5570561. CLEARED.
/dev/hda3: Entry '..' in .../??? (5570625) has deleted/unused inode
5570561. CLEARED.
/dev/hda3: Entry '..' in .../??? (5570567) has deleted/unused inode
5570561. CLEARED.
