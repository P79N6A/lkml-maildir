I didn't see a clear list. 
My impression so far is that you're not quite sure what you want,
otherwise you would be more concrete.

You mean returning the register number for RDPMC or equivalent
and a way to enable it for ring 3 access? 
I'm considering that an essential feature too. I wasn't aware
it was dropped.

Yes it is for everybody. I've been rather questioning if the slow
ways (complicated syscalls) to get the counter information are really 
needed.

Why is it important?

What do you mean with custom sample formats exactly?  What information
do you want in there? And why?
e.g. PEBS and so on pretty much fix the in memory sample format in hardware,
so they only way to get a custom format would be to use a separate buffer.
I can think of one reason why the kernel should add more information
in a separate buffer (log the instruction bytes so that it can
be disassembled and a address histogram be generated using the PEBS
register values), but it is a relatively obscure one and definitely
not a essential feature. Unfortunately it is also hard to implement completely
race-free.

Sorry, but these kind of non technical BS arguments will just make
you be ignored in mainline Linux lands. They might work if you pay
a lot of money to specific Linux companies (do you?), but here
on linux-kernel you have to convince with purely technical arguments.
