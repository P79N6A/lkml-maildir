It isn't FUD. One data point doesn't allow you to draw conclusions.
Yes, I've seen/heard of ext2/ext3 failures and data loss too. But at least
the same number for ReiserFS. And I know it is outnumbered 10 to 1 or so in
my sample, so that would indicate at a 10 fold higher probability of
catastrophic data loss, other factors mostly the same.

Can't have both.
