the problem with your argument is that the definition of what 
constitutes "work" is up to copyright law, _not_ the license writer. 
I.e. you cannot just cleverly define "source code" to include something 
unrelated and then pretend that it's all in one work. And that's exactly 
what the GPLv3 does: it creatively defines the hardware's key into the 
'source code' of the software and then asks for that to be provided 
_not_ because somehow the key derives from the software (it clearly does 
not), but as a "compensation" for the right to redistribute! I.e. it's 
trying to extend its scope to some item that is not part of the 
software. See?
