	OK, I have tried again, and it is 100% reproducible at work
	as well.
	At the time it dies, the kernel loops in the procedure :
	truncate_inode_pages.
	It still responds to ping, but does not more.
	Here, at work, it happens when I log as danis, issue then
	a 'su' to get root access, and type 'exit'. Nothing more. Boom.
	My home is NFS mounted from a Solaris 2.5.1 box. At home,
	it happens against a 2.0.36 UNFSD server. I think it did
	happen as well with 2.2.7-ac4 (I have done a report on it
	too few days ago).
	One more thing : as I typed repetitive ALT-SCROLL to check
	the registers, I got a bunch of addresses printed on the
	screens and a :
Code: c7 05 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 83 c4 08 5b 5e 5f 5d 83 c4 08
Aiee, killing interrupt handler
Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer derefere,ce at virtual address 00000001
	I think it is due to my repetitive ALT-SCROLL, and I would not
	bother that much (bad people would simply hit the reset button
	however).
