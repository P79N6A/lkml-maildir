	Hello, Nathan, many thanks for the reply.
	The machine locked up last night again, so I cannot login, and I cannot 
manage to remember if I enabled 4K stacks in the code, could be possible, but 
I am not sure.
	What I am sure of is that /mnt was plenty (8-10 GB or so) of disk space. I 
had two or three concurrent accesses, IIRC, some of them writing from the 
RAID to the SCSI (both using XFS), and the last one finding and removing 
unwanted packages.
	Could this scenario give you some hints? I will return where the server is in 
5 hours, and I will send to the list the .config.
	Again, many thanks,
		Ender.
