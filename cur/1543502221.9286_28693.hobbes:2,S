I've already corresponded with Jan Kara <jack@atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz>,
who has been working on the quota code, it turns out that quota works
properly more or less without any changes-- one thing, though, is that due
to the structure of the quota file, you can't set quotas for the full
32-bit UID range (it works only up to about 26 bits, or 64 million users).
Beyond that, you exceed the maximum filesize (2GB) for the quota file on
32-bit systems. I bet that on systems that support 64-bit file sizes
(Alpha and Ultrasparc for now) there wouldn't be any problems.
In any case, the user quota utilities bog down to useless speed when
dealing with a quota file that big. (the kernel is fine)
This doesn't break backwards compatibility, in any case, but other changes
to the quota system in the future likely will.

From the code, this shouldn't be a problem:
sprintf( ... "Uid:\t%d\t%d\t%d\t%d\n", "Gid:\t%d\t%d\t%d\t%d\n", ...
	p->uid, p->euid, p->suid, p->fsuid, .... etc)
Likewise, the ps program seems to be using type 'int' to parse /proc, as
it doesn't have a problem displaying the information.
Thanks,
