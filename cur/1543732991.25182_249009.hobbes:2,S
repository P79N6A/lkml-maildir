And what makes this different?

Just upgrade all of drm.  You don't uopgrade a single drm driver either.
Or introduce a DRM_VERSION macro ala KERNEL_VERSION.    But best thing is
really to keep the mast copy of drm in the latest kernel and let vendors
backport if nessecary.

I think you need to start to play the kernel game if you want your code
in the kernel.  I know X has this strange idea of beeing useful mostly to
make propritary vendors their life easier, but in kernel lands we thing
differently.
