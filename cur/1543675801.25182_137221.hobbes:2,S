I had a private reply form a guy that had three of these running
reliably on 2.4.21-pre6, and he noted he'd never done cd->disk
transfers, but across the net. So I did the same.
Results are that it survived a lot longer, I managed to get about
700Mb across at about 8Mb/s (line speed 100mbit half duplex) before it
fell over with this:

Load only got up to about 3-4 before it fell over.
Apart from that, it seems the speed at which it falls over is depening
on two factors: with/without debugging and speed at which data arrives
for the drive.
Using a ssh-session that limited it to 3Mb/sec and it ran fine for a
long time with interrupts showing at about 5000 a second for the
usb-controller (vs. 1000 for the timer). With the example above that
made it fall over it ran at close to 10k interrupts/sec.
If it makes a difference, transferring from a local CD-ROM to the
drive across USB 2.0 also uses ide-scsi. The 2.4 example I had falling
over used no ide-scsi.
mvh,
A
