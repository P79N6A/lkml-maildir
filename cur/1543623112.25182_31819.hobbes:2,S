Even though I wouldn't go so far as to call the 2.4 series stable (not
disrespecting the kernel hackers), i've been wondering whether my hours
spent in front of the computer are dulling my senses; i've had
intermittent lock-ups and 'soft'-locks, where hardly any processing is
done. I'm running 2.4.17 on a dell dimension. 
I wouldn't say you're crazy, but i'm getting nervous tics from sitting
in front of the computer screen all day, so what can I say :)
