Additional issues not fully address are 8-bit transfers.
Lastly if a host can not do 16-bit transfers it is bad and broken and the
OEM needs to be railed for it.  Defaulting to 32-bit with legacy hardware
still in the mix will eat somebodies data.
Much of this discussion as to expose a bogus policy of forcing hardware
to 32-bit and causing other problems that are not reported in the proper
light.  When people put DOC or ATA-Flash in the onboard host it will mess
things up.  Since there are people who think it is okay to set policies in
hardware and have gotten away with it, adding in the default to undo the
bogusity will point that most hardware does not need the is junk and let
it resided with the enduser.
