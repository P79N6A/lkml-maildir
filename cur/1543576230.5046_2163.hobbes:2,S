v0.99.0 of the system performance tuning tool "Powertweak" is released.
Available from 
http://powertweak.sourceforge.net
 This release brought about a complete rewrite.
 Some of the major changes since the last public release are...
 - Should now work on all architectures.
   (Tested on ia32/Sparc/Alpha/PPC)
 - By default, Powertweak now starts as a daemon that should be
   run on bootup. (Old behaviour still possible with --no-daemon)
   The GUI now communicates with the daemon instead of doing
   the tweaking itself. 
 - Backends are now completely modular plugin libraries.
   This allowed for easier cross-platform usage, and a cleaner API.
 - Profiles.
   Tell Powertweak "This is a webserver" and have it auto-tune.
 - Rewritten /proc/sys tuning backend.
 - PCI backend now uses XML files to describe tweaks. 
   Several chipsets added since 0.1.17 release.
 - Addition of a disk elevator tuning backend.
 - CPU register tuning is now possible, as long as you have the
   cpuid/msr drivers in your kernel (2.2.18, or 2.4.0test)
 - Working text mode user interface.
regards,
Davej.
