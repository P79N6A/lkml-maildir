Not sure if this issue has been raised before:
In `make menuconfig` (not sure about make xconfig), seems it doesn't
make much sense to allow someone to select APM as a kernel module and
also allow "Enable PM at boot time".  The configs should disallow the
second when compiled as a module.
Consequence of allowing both:
module cannot be inserted.
Ciao,
