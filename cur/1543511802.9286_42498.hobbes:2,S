Hi there !,
I'm trying to patch the Alan's OSS patch "2.0.36-modular-1.test.patch.gz"
from the his ftp 
ftp://ftp.linux.org.uk/pub/linux/alan/Sound/
 but I fail.
I apply this patch to a 2.0.36 kernel source using the following command
(after descompressing it!):
patch -p1 < ../2.0.36-modular-1.test.patch
but it is rejected:
I obtain a sb_common.orig and a sb_common.rej file and several
unexpected (at leat for me ;-) )'Hunk #x suceeded at ...' messages
What it's wrong ???
TIA,
	Juanjo
