I have modified msecs_to_jiffies() to do the proper rounding when HZ=100.
Do these work better?
static inline unsigned long msecs_to_jiffies(unsigned long msecs)
{
#if 1000 % HZ == 0
        return (msecs + ((1000 / HZ) - 1)) / (1000 / HZ);
#elif HZ % 1000 == 0
        return msecs * (HZ / 1000);
#else
        return (msecs / 1000) * HZ + (msecs % 1000) * HZ / 1000;
#endif
}
static inline unsigned long jiffies_to_msecs(unsigned long jiffs)
{
#if 1000 % HZ == 0
        return jiffs * (1000 / HZ);
#elif HZ % 1000 == 0
        return jiffs / (HZ / 1000);
#else
        return (jiffs / HZ) * 1000 + (jiffs % HZ) * 1000 / HZ;
#endif
}
Thanks
