Hi friends!
I'm trying to develop a Dristributed Shared Memory sytem(DSM) using Linux.
I was wondering myself if using IP for the protocol of the comunicationg
nodes were correct?. I thing using IP will add so much bytes to the
messages(actually packets) sent by the nodes. Will be better try another
lighter protocol?. 
Could you also point me to other similar projects that are being develop?
it will clear my ideas and help me with my problems
Thank you very much
