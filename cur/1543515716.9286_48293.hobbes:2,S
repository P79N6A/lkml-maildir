I don't played with UDMA on CDROMS, only simple DMA.
I don't care about a potential UDMA bug,
simple DMA solves all latency problems, and the performance
difference between DMA and UDMA on a CDROM drive is almost
zero. (since the CDROM is the bottleneck).
The command I usually use to tune the CDROM is :
hdparm -u 1 -c 1 -d 1 /dev/hdc
it is a cheap MASHITA 6x DVD drive:

are you sured that the BX chipset is flawed ?
It seems to work well.

Mainboard Gigabyte GA 6BXD (dual) with BX chipset.

Wrong: try to dig on deja.com searching articles about
DVD software playback on windoze:
for most people it is almost impossible to get skipfree video
without DMA.

I was wondering how much % of the controllers are faulty in this respect.
