I'm not sure if these patches would be of any use here.
One benefit of the multi-queue scheduling patches is that
they allow multiple 'wakeups' to run in parallel instead
of being serialized by the global runqueue lock.  Now if
you are getting lots of interrupts which result in task
wakeups that could potentially be run in parallel (on
separate CPUS with no other serialization in the way)
then you 'might' see some benefit.  Those are some big IFs.
I know little about the networking stack or this workload.
Just wanted to explain how this scheduling work 'could'
be related to interrupt load.
