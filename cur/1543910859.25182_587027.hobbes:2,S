  if you're going to do something like that, you might as well take
the extra step and start keeping track of which versions of gcc work
with which architectures, along the lines of what dan kegel did with
the results matrix of crosstool:
http://www.kegel.com/crosstool/crosstool-0.43/buildlogs/
  i'm being only moderately facetious, of course but, on the other
hand, if there's all this anecdotal information regarding which
combinations work and which don't, maybe it's worth codifying that
into a compilation check somewhere in the build process.
  after all, at the moment in init/main.c, any gcc < 3.2 is rejected
outright, while gcc-4.1.0 generates a warning.  that's incredibly ad
hoc and certainly incomplete.  might as well just write a script for
the scripts/ directory which accepts an architecture and a version of
gcc and tells you what the current situation is and what you can do
about it.
