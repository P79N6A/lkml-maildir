It is probably more dangerous and difficult than it is worth.  Use a
backup/restore, that way you also have a backup in case there is a
problem with the conversion.
Since you would ALWAYS do a backup before performing such an operation
(right????) then doing the restore to the newly formatted reiserfs
partition would probably take less time than any kind of conversion
would take (and be a LOT more robust, as well as doing a "defrag"),
so you are way better off to do it that way.
Cheers, Andreas
