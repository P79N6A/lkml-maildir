Hello all,
I was just wondering if anyone had given any thought to a Linux
implementation of SMP for the K7, or even if anyone is working on it yet? 
I think it might be overly ambitious of me to try and lead the effort
(I've done some kernel work on the Mach kernel in networking, this is
certainly more challenging), but I'm interested in contributing to it as
soon as dual cpu motherboards become available.  Perhaps existing Alpha
21264 dual MB's can be used for this purpose, as they use the same bus
protocol. 
Thanks,
Dave Broudy             dave@broudy.net
