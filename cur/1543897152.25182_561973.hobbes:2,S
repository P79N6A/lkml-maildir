Yes, it certainly seems to. Now running with this patch and 4GB active,
I've transferred about 15GB with no problem so far. It usually oopses
after a GB or two.
I guess it's not an ideal solution, architecturally speaking, but it's a
good deal better than an unstable driver. If there's any other patches
you'd like me to test or traces to capture, I'm happy to help out.
Otherwise I'll run with this one for now since it does the job!
Thanks.
