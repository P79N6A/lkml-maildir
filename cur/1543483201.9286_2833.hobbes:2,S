Does that mean that:
- the kernel (i.e. the buffer cache, paging unit, swapper, etc.) will not
support more than 2 GB physical memory on 32 bit machines.
- you would accept patches that make it possible to use the remaining memory
as as raw physical memory.
The physical memory could be used for ram disks (->swap file), or for other
devices that need lots of memory without kernel support.
Is someone currently writing such a patch?
