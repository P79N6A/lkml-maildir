Following your logic it would be a "failure to distribute the source code for 
a work".
However, since the signing is an automated process it cannot generate a "new" 
work - at least, not under the laws of the US - so the signature itself 
cannot have a copyright at all.
DRH
PS: This is the exact same reason that the GPL cannot apply to a Bison 
generated parser in the US. The "input" file that causes Bison to generate 
the output can have a copyright, but not the output - no matter what RMS or 
anyone else wants, and no matter what the GPL says about it.
