Hi,
I've updated the kexec patch for 2.6.0-test7.
It can be found at
  
http://developer.osdl.org/rddunlap/kexec/2.6.0-test7/kexec-260t7.patch
A slightly different version of it can also be found in the
-osdl patchset at
  
http://developer.osdl.org/shemminger/patches/2.6/2.6.0-test7/
The userspace tools are at
  
http://www.xmission.com/~ebiederm/files/kexec/
You'll need to update the kexec-syscall.c file for the correct
kexec syscall number (274).
I intend to try to automate this (somehow).
Feedback/patches welcome.
