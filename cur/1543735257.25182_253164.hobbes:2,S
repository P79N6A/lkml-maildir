You can rip the bits apart instead, and leave the glueing and rip-patching
to the computer.
- edit patch file:
  - delete all the parts you don't want applied; freely hand-edit stuff,
    and don't worry about the pesky line numbers
  - save to new patch file
- run "rediff" to fix up the new file
- run "interdiff" to create a second, clean patch file
  containing just the deleted parts
- iterate until finished
All of this is part of the nice patchutils package.
NB: if all else fails, use espdiff(1).
