The original question was how to enter sysrq from a serial console.
AFAICT, the only way of entering alt-sysrq is directly from a PC
keyboard, I can see no way of doing it from a serial console.  Proc
handle_sysrq is only called from handle_scancode in keyboard.c.  Serial
consoles do not have scancodes.
So a question for the serial experts.  How do you enter alt-sysrq on a
serial console?  Expecially if that console could be a dumb VT100 or an
emulator running on Linux or even another OS entirely?
