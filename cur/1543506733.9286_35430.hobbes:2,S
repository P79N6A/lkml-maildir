+/*
+ *       ISDN operations
+ *
+ * Many of these routines take an "int dev" argument, which is simply
+ * an index into the drivers[] array.  Currently, we only support a
+ * single foreign chip, so the value should always be 0.  B channel
+ * operations require an "int chan", which should be 0 for channel B1
+ * and 1 for channel B2
+ *
+ * int get_irqnum(int dev)
+ *
+ *   returns the interrupt number being used by the chip.  ISDN4linux
+ *   uses this number to watch the interrupt during initialization and
+ *   make sure something is happening.
+ *
+ * int get_liu_state(int dev)
+ *
+ *   returns the current state of the ISDN Line Interface Unit (LIU)
+ *   as a number between 2 (state F2) and 7 (state F7).  0 may also be
+ *   returned if the chip doesn't exist or the LIU hasn't been
+ *   activated.  The meanings of the states are defined in I.430, ISDN
+ *   BRI Physical Layer Interface.  The most important two states are
+ *   F3 (shutdown) and F7 (syncronized).
+ *
+ * void liu_init(int dev, void (*callback)(void *), void *callback_arg)
+ *
+ *   initializes the LIU and optionally registers a callback to be
+ *   signaled upon a change of LIU state.  The callback will be called
+ *   with a single opaque callback_arg.  Once the callback has been
+ *   triggered, get_liu_state can be used to determine the LIU
+ *   current state.
+ *
+ * void liu_activate(int dev, int priority)
+ *
+ *   requests LIU activation at a given D-channel priority.
+ *   Successful activatation is achieved upon entering state F7, which
+ *   will trigger any callback previously registered with
+ *   liu_init.
+ *
+ * void liu_deactivate(int dev)
+ *
+ *   deactivates LIU.  Outstanding D and B channel transactions are
+ *   terminated rudely and without callback notification.  LIU change
+ *   of state callback will be triggered, however.
+ *
+ * void dxmit(int dev, __u8 *buffer, unsigned int count,
+ *            void (*callback)(void *, int), void *callback_arg)
+ *
+ *   transmits a packet - specified with buffer, count - over the D-channel
+ *   interface.  Buffer should begin with the LAPD address field and
+ *   end with the information field.  FCS and flag sequences should not
+ *   be included, nor is bit-stuffing required - all these functions are
+ *   performed by the chip.  The callback function will be called
+ *   DURING THE TOP HALF OF AN INTERRUPT HANDLER and will be passed
+ *   both the arbitrary callback_arg and an integer error indication:
+ *
+ *       0 - successful transmission; ready for next packet
+ *   non-0 - error value
+ *
+ *   The callback routine should defer any time-consuming operations
+ *   to a bottom-half handler; however, dxmit may be called
+ *   from within the callback to request back-to-back transmission of
+ *   a second packet (without repeating the priority/collision mechanism)
+ *
+ *   A comment about the "collision detect" error, which is signalled
+ *   whenever the echoed D-channel data didn't match the transmitted
+ *   data.  This is part of ISDN's normal multi-drop T-interface
+ *   operation, indicating that another device has attempted simultaneous
+ *   transmission, but can also result from line noise.  An immediate
+ *   requeue via dxmit is suggested, but repeated collision
+ *   errors may indicate a more serious problem.
+ *
+ * void drecv(int dev, __u8 *buffer, unsigned int size,
+ *            void (*callback)(void *, int, unsigned int),
+ *            void *callback_arg)
+ *
+ *   register a buffer - buffer, size - into which a D-channel packet
+ *   can be received.  The callback function will be called DURING
+ *   THE TOP HALF OF AN INTERRUPT HANDLER and will be passed an
+ *   arbitrary callback_arg, an integer error indication and the length
+ *   of the received packet, which will start with the address field,
+ *   end with the information field, and not contain flag or FCS
+ *   bytes.  Bit-stuffing will already have been corrected for.
+ *   Possible values of second callback argument "error":
+ *
+ *       0 - successful reception
+ *   non-0 - error value
+ *
+ * int bopen(int dev, int chan, int hdlcmode, u_char xmit_idle_char)
+ *
+ *   This function should be called before any other operations on a B
+ *   channel.  mode is either non-0 to (de)encapsulate using HDLC or 0
+ *   for transparent operation. In addition to arranging for interrupt
+ *   handling and channel multiplexing, it sets the xmit_idle_char
+ *   which is transmitted on the interface when no data buffer is
+ *   available.  Suggested values are: 0 for ISDN audio; FF for HDLC
+ *   mark idle; 7E for HDLC flag idle.  Returns 0 on a successful
+ *   open; -1 on error.
+ *
+ *   If the chip doesn't support HDLC encapsulation (the Am7930
+ *   doesn't), an error will be returned opening L1_MODE_HDLC; the
+ *   HiSax driver should retry with L1_MODE_TRANS, then be prepared to
+ *   bit-stuff the data before shipping it to the driver.
+ *
+ * void bclose(int dev, int chan)
+ *
+ *   Shuts down a B channel when no longer in use.
+ *
+ * void bxmit(int dev, int chan, __u8 *buffer, unsigned int count,
+ *            void (*callback)(void *, int), void *callback_arg)
+ *
+ *   transmits a data block - specified with buffer, count - over the
+ *   B channel interface specified by dev/chan.  In mode L1_MODE_HDLC,
+ *   a complete HDLC frames should be relayed with a single bxmit.
+ *   The callback function will be called DURING THE TOP HALF OF AN
+ *   INTERRUPT HANDLER and will be passed the arbitrary callback_arg
+ *   and an integer error indication:
+ *
+ *       0 - successful transmission; ready for next packet
+ *   non-0 - error
+ *
+ *   The callback routine should defer any time-consuming operations
+ *   to a bottom-half handler; however, bxmit may be called
+ *   from within the callback to request back-to-back transmission of
+ *   another data block
+ *
+ * void brecv(int dev, int chan, __u8 *buffer, unsigned int size,
+ *            void (*callback)(void *, int, unsigned int), void *callback_arg)
+ *
+ *   receive a raw data block - specified with buffer, size - over the
+ *   B channel interface specified by dev/chan.  The callback function
+ *   will be called DURING THE TOP HALF OF AN INTERRUPT HANDLER and
+ *   will be passed the arbitrary callback_arg, an integer error
+ *   indication and the length of the received packet.  In HDLC mode,
+ *   the packet will start with the address field, end with the
+ *   information field, and will not contain flag or FCS bytes.
+ *   Bit-stuffing will already have been corrected for.
+ *
+ *   Possible values of second callback argument "error":
+ *
+ *       0 - successful reception
+ *   non-0 - error value
+ *
+ *   The callback routine should defer any time-consuming operations
+ *   to a bottom-half handler; however, brecv may be called
+ *   from within the callback to register another buffer and ensure
+ *   continuous B channel reception without loss of data
