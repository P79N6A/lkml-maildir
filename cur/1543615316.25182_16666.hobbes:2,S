   OK, here is my oops
   reiserfs: checking transaction log (device 08:14) ...
   Using r5 hash to sort names
   Unsupported unaligned load/store trap for kernel at <000000000059bae8>.
Looks like some change in reiserfs in 2.4.17 has caused it to start
doing {set,clear,change}_bit() operations on pointers which are not
"long" aligned.
Franks a lot,
