Still seeing the same breakage as I posted about here in -mm2:
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0606.3/0195.html
I've since noticed that mail delivery is held up by the deliver process. 
'deliver' is a component of the dovecot mail system (
http://www.dovecot.org/
) 
which does delivery of mails to a user's Maildir and in the process recreates an 
index.

I can't kill these processes with a KILL signal, nor can I strace them.
Revert to -mm1 or any previous kernel release, and it all works fine.  That 
leads me to believe this is probably not a userspace issue.
What patches which could have possibly caused this?
